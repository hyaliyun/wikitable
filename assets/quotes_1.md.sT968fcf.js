Life and career  He was born in 490 AD at Philadelphia in Lydia, whence his cognomen \\"Lydus\\". At an early age he set out to seek his fortune in Constantinople, and held high court and state offices in the praetorian prefecture of the East under Anastasius and Justinian. In 552, he lost Justinian's favour and was dismissed. The date of his death is not known, but he was probably alive during the early years of Justin II (reigned 565–578).  Literary work  During his retirement he occupied himself in the compilation of works on the antiquities of Rome, three of which have been preserved: #De Ostentis (Gr. ), on the origin and progress of the art of divination #De Magistratibus reipublicae Romanae (Gr. ), especially valuable for the administrative details of the time of Justinian; the work is now dated to 550 by Michael Maas.Michael Maas, John Lydus and the Roman Past (London-New York, 1992). #De Mensibus (Gr. ), a history of the different pagan festivals of the year. The chief value of these books consists in the fact that the author made use of the works (now lost) of old Roman writers on similar subjects. Lydus was also commissioned by Justinian to compose a panegyric on the emperor, and a history of his campaign against Sassanid Persia; but these, as well as some poetical compositions, are lost.

An internet meme, more commonly known simply as a meme ( ), is a type of meme that is spread via the Internet, often through social media platforms and especially for humorous purposes. Memes can spread from person to person via social networks, blogs, direct email, or news sources. They may relate to various existing Internet cultures or subcultures, often created or spread on various websites. One hallmark of internet memes is the appropriation of a part of broader culture, for instance by giving words and phrases intentional misspellings (such as lolcats) or using incorrect grammar (such as doge); in particular, many memes utilize popular culture (especially in image macros of other media), although this can lead to issues with copyright. Instant communication on the internet facilitates word of mouth transmission, resulting in fads and sensations that tend to grow rapidly. An example of such a fad is that of planking, the act of posting a photo of people lying down in public places; putting the photo online brings attention to the fad and allows it to reach a high number of people in a short amount of time. “Dank” memes have emerged as a new form of image-macros, and many modern memes take on inclusion of surreal, nonsensical, and non-sequitur themes. Colloquially, the terms meme and internet meme may refer to pieces of media that are designed in the format of true internet memes, but which are not themselves intended to spread or evolve, and which have recently become umbrella terms referring to any piece of quickly-consumed comedic or relatable content. What is considered a meme may vary across different communities on the internet and is subject to change over time: traditionally, memes consisted of a combination of image macros and a concept or catchphrase, but the concept has since become broader and more multi-faceted, evolving to include more elaborate structures such as challenges, GIFs, videos, and viral sensations.  Background  The word meme was coined by Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene as an attempt to explain how ideas replicate, mutate and evolve (memetics). The concept of the Internet meme was first proposed by Mike Godwin in the June 1993 issue of Wired. In 2013, Dawkins characterized an Internet meme as being a meme deliberately altered by human creativity—distinguished from biological genes and his own pre-Internet concept of a meme, which involved mutation by random change and spreading through accurate replication as in Darwinian selection. Dawkins explained that Internet memes are thus a \\"hijacking of the original idea\\", the very idea of a meme having mutated and evolved in this new direction. (video of speech) Furthermore, Internet memes carry an additional property that ordinary memes do not: Internet memes leave a footprint in the media through which they propagate (for example, social networks) that renders them traceable and analyzable. Paper explained for laymen by = Common attributes = There are two central attributes of internet memes: creative reproduction of materials and intertextuality. Creative reproduction refers to “parodies, remixes, or mashups,” and include notable examples such as “Hitler’s Downfall Parodies,” and “Nyan Cat,” among others. Intertextuality may be demonstrated through memes that combine disparate cultures; for example, a meme may combine United States politician Mitt Romney's assertion of the phrase “binders full of women” from a 2012 US presidential debate with the Korean pop song \\"Gangnam style\\" by overlaying the politician's quote onto a frame from Psy's music video where paper blows around him. The intertextuality in the example gives new meaning to the paper blowing around Psy, the meme indexes intertextual practices in political and cultural discourses of two nations.  Evolution and propagation  Typical format for image macros. An Internet meme may stay the same or may evolve over time, by chance or through commentary, imitations, parody, or by incorporating news accounts about itself. Internet memes can evolve and spread extremely rapidly, sometimes reaching worldwide popularity within a few days. Internet memes usually are formed from some social interaction, pop culture reference, or situations people often find themselves in. Their rapid growth and impact has caught the attention of both researchers and industry. Academically, researchers model how they evolve and predict which memes will survive and spread throughout the Web. Commercially, they are used in viral marketing where they are an inexpensive form of mass advertising. One empirical approach studied meme characteristics and behavior independently from the networks in which they propagated, and reached a set of conclusions concerning successful meme propagation. For example, the study asserted that Internet memes not only compete for viewer attention generally resulting in a shorter life, but also, through user creativity, memes can collaborate with each other and achieve greater survival. Also, paradoxically, an individual meme that experiences a popularity peak significantly higher than its average popularity is not generally expected to survive unless it is unique, whereas a meme with no such popularity peak keeps being used together with other memes and thus has greater survivability. Multiple opposing studies on media psychology and communication have aimed to characterize and analyze the concept and representations in order to make it accessible for the academic research. Thus, Internet memes can be regarded as a unit of information which replicates via the Internet. This unit can replicate or mutate. This mutation instead of being generational follows more a viral pattern, giving the Internet memes generally a short life. Other theoretical problems with the Internet memes are their behavior, their type of change, and their teleology. Internet memes have been examined by Dancygier and Vandelanotte in 2017 for aspects of cognitive linguistic and construction grammar. The authors analyzed some selective popular image macros like, Said no one ever, One does not simply, But that's none of my business, and Good Girl Gina to draw attention to the constructionally, multimodality, viewpoint and intersubjectivity of these memes. They further argued that with the combination of text and images, the internet memes can add to the functioning linguistic construction frame as well as create new linguistic constructions. Writing for The Washington Post in 2013, Dominic Basulto asserted that with the growth of the Internet and the practices of the marketing and advertising industries, memes have come to transmit fewer snippets of human culture that could survive for centuries as originally envisioned by Dawkins, and instead transmit banality at the expense of big ideas. History Internet memes grew as a concept in the mid-1990s. At the time, memes were just short clips that were shared between people in Usenet forums. As the Internet evolved, so did memes. When YouTube was released in 2005, video memes became popular. Around this time, rickrolling became popular and the link to this video was sent around via email or other messaging sites. Video sharing also created memes such as \\"Turn Down for What\\" and the \\"Harlem Shake\\". As social media websites such as Twitter and Facebook started appearing, it was now easy to share GIFs and image macros to a large audience. Meme generator websites were created to let users create their own memes out of existing templates. Memes during this time could remain popular for a long time, from a few months to a decade, which contrasts with the fast lifespan of modern memes. Early in the Internet's history, memes were primarily spread via email or Usenet discussion communities. Messageboards and newsgroups were also popular because they allowed a simple method for people to share information or memes with a diverse population of Internet users in a short period. They encourage communication between people, and thus between meme sets, that do not normally come in contact. Furthermore, they actively promote meme-sharing within the messageboard or newsgroup population by asking for feedback, comments, opinions, etc. This format is what gave rise to early Internet memes, like the Hampster Dance. Another factor in the increased meme transmission observed over the Internet is its interactive nature. Print matter, radio, and television are all essentially passive experiences requiring the reader, listener, or viewer to perform all necessary cognitive processing; in contrast, the social nature of the Internet allows phenomena to propagate more readily. Many phenomena are also spread via web search engines, Internet forums, social networking services, social news sites, and video hosting services. Much of the Internet's ability to spread information is assisted from results found through search engines, which can allow users to find memes even with obscure information. The earlier forms of image based memes include the demotivator, image macro, photoshopped image, LOLCats, advice animal, and comic. The Demotivator image includes a black background with white, capitalized text, often in Times New Roman. The objective of using this format was to parodize inspirational and motivational posters, where the name \\"demotivator\\" is derived from. Image macro consists of an image with white Impact font within a black border. The text/context of the meme is at the top and bottom of the image itself. The photoshopped image is closely related to the macro image, but often is created without the use of text, mostly edited with another image. Advice animals contain a photoshopped image of an animal's head on top of a rainbow/color wheel background. It includes the image macro of the top and bottom text with Impact font. LOLCats incorporate the design of image macro and advice animals, but instead of just the cat's head, it is the entire picture unedited with top and bottom text, often with the usage of Internet slang. Comics follow a typical newspaper comic strip format. There are a variety of different ways to create one, as multiple images and texts can be used to create the overall meme. = Modern memes = An example of a dank meme on the subject of Wikipedia and its practice on article referencing. Modern memes began to arise first in the form of \\"dank\\" memes, a sub-genre of memes usually involving meme formats in a different way to the image macros that were in large use before. The term \\"dank\\", which means \\"a cold, damp place\\", was later adapted by marijuana smokers to refer to high-quality marijuana, and then became an ironic term for a type of meme, also becoming synonymous for \\"cool\\". This term originally meant a meme that was significantly different from the norm, but is now used mainly to differentiate these modern types of memes from other, older types such as image macros. Dank memes can also refer to \\"exceptionally unique or odd\\" memes. They have been described as \\"Internet in-jokes\\" that are \\"so played out that they become funny again\\" or are \\"so nonsensical that they are hilarious\\". The formats are usually from popular television shows, movies, or video games and users then add humorous text and images over it. The culture surrounding memes, especially dank memes, grew to the point of the creation of many subcultures surrounding them. For instance, a \\"meme market\\", satirizing on the kind of talks and stocks found normally on Wall Street, was created in September 2016. Originally started on Reddit as r/MemeEconomy, people would only jokingly \\"buy\\" or \\"sell\\" shares in a meme to indicate how popular a meme was thought to be. The market is seen as a way to show how people assign value to commonplace and otherwise valueless things such as memes. Modern internet meme on the subject of Wikipedia and pages breaking when certain characters are removed. Internet memes sometimes represent everyday problems One example of a dank meme is \\"Who Killed Hannibal\\", which is made of two frames from a 2013 episode of The Eric Andre Show. The meme features the host Andre shooting his co-host Buress in the first frame and then lamenting that his co-host has been shot in the next, with Andre often depicted blaming someone else for the shot. This was then adapted to other situations, such as baby boomers blaming millennials for problems that they allegedly caused. Dank memes can also stem from interesting real-life images that get shared or remixed many times. So- called \\"moth\\" memes (often stylized with diacritics on the \\"o\\": \\"möth\\") came about after a Reddit user posted a close up picture of a moth that they had found outside their window onto the r/creepy subreddit. This image of a moth became popular, and began to be used in memes. These moth memes usually revolved around the moth wanting to find a lamp. According to Chris Grinter, a lepidopterist from the California Academy of Sciences, these memes took off because people find moths' attraction to lamps quite strange and this phenomenon is still not completely explained by science. Irony and absurdism Example of a deepfried meme without any context. Surrealist and nonsensical themes are typical of modern memes Many modern memes stem from nonsense or otherwise unrelated phrases that are repeated and placed onto other formats. One example of this is \\"they did surgery on a grape,\\" from a video of a da Vinci Surgical System performing test surgery on a grape. People sharing the post tended to add the same caption to it (\\"they did surgery on a grape\\"), and eventually created a satirical image with several layers of captions on it. Memes such as this one continue to propagate as people start to include the phrase in different, otherwise unrelated memes. The increasing trend towards irony in meme culture has resulted in absurdist memes not unlike postmodern art. Many Internet memes have several layers of meaning built off of other memes, not being understandable unless the viewer has seen all previous memes. \\"Deep-fried\\" memes, memes that have been distorted and run through several filters, are often counter-culture and strange to one not familiar with them.Know Your Meme. \\"Deep-fried memes\\" .

Pepe memes Matt Furie's cartoon character Pepe the Frog became an Internet meme when its popularity steadily grew across Myspace, Gaia Online and 4chan in 2008. In 2014, images of Pepe were shared on social media by celebrities such as Katy Perry and Nicki Minaj. This resulted in a significant rise in popularity. By 2015, it had become one of the most popular memes used on 4chan and Tumblr. Different types of Pepe include \\"Sad Frog\\", \\"Smug Frog\\", and \\"Angry Pepe\\". Since 2014, \\"Rare Pepes\\" have been posted on the (satirical) \\"meme market\\" as if they were trading cards. During the 2016 United States presidential election, Pepe became associated with racism, the alt-right, and support for Donald Trump. Shortly following this, Pepe was designated as a hate symbol by the Anti-Defamation League, though not every Pepe meme is classified as one. Until September 2018, Social media service Gab used a Pepe-like illustration of a frog (named \\"Gabby\\") as its logo. The site is popular with the alt-right. Pepe's likeness was also used by protestors in the ongoing 2019–20 Hong Kong protests as a symbol of defiance and resistance to the government of Mainland China. In contrast with the meme's public perception in the West, protestors saw it as a cartoon that \\"looks funny and captures the hearts of so many youngsters. It is a symbol of youth participation in this movement.\\" =Short-form video = After the success of the application Vine, a format of memes emerged in the form of short videos and scripted sketches.Jude Dry. \\"Vine Is Gone, But Not Forgotten: Why Twitter's Defunct Platform Was an Incubator for Digital Creatives.\\" Retrieved September 19, 2019. Vine, in spite of its closure in early 2017, has still retained relevance through uploads of viral vines in compilations onto other sharing social media sites such as Twitter and YouTube.Julia Glum. \\"Millions Are Obsessed With Vine Compilations on YouTube. Now There's a Battle Brewing Over Who Should Get Paid.\\" Money.com. Retrieved September 19, 2019.

The short-form videos created on sites like Vine and TikTok found use in being posted on other social media sites, such as Twitter, as a form of reacting and responding to other posts. These videos become replicated into other contexts and often become part of Internet culture. An example of a TikTok meme is the cosplay by Nyannyancosplay juxtaposed to the musical track “Mia Khalifa” by ILOVEFRIDAY. This meme became known as Hit or Miss. Hit or Miss has been referenced multiple times, including Pewdiepie's 2018 Rewind as one of the most influential memes of the year alongside numerous other influential memes of the year. Pewdiepie's 2018 rewind video has been viewed over 70 million times and has 8.9 million likes as of April 28, 2020. Hit or Miss has been remixed as well, including by other social media influencers such as Belle Delphine. SirKibbs’ YouTube has uploaded a video of Belle Delphine and Kat (Nyannyancosplay) side-by-side comparison and has garnered 2.7 million views as of April 28, 2020. Marketing Public relations, advertising, and marketing professionals have embraced Internet memes as a form of viral marketing and guerrilla marketing to create marketing \\"buzz\\" for their product or service. The practice of using memes to market products or services is known as memetic marketing. Internet memes are seen as cost- effective, and because they are a (sometimes self-conscious) fad, they are therefore used as a way to create an image of awareness or trendiness. To this end, businesses have taken to attempting two methods of using memes to increase publicity and sales of their company; either creating a meme or attempting to adapt or perpetuate an existing one. Examples of memetic marketing include the FreeCreditReport.com singing ad campaign, the \\"Nope, Chuck Testa\\" meme from an advertisement for taxidermist Chuck Testa, Wilford Brimley saying \\"Diabeetus\\" from Liberty Medical and the Dumb Ways to Die public announcement ad campaign by Metro Trains Melbourne. Marketers, for example, use Internet memes to create interest in films that would otherwise not generate positive publicity among critics. The 2006 film Snakes on a Plane generated much publicity via this method. Used in the context of public relations, the term would be more of an advertising buzzword than a proper Internet meme, although there is still an implication that the interest in the content is for purposes of trivia, ephemera, or frivolity rather than straightforward advertising and news. Brands' use of memes has disadvantages when considering people's perception of a brand. While effective use of a meme can lead to increased sales and attention, seeming forced, unoriginal, or unfunny can negatively impact the brand as a whole. For instance, the fast food company Wendy's began a social media approach in 2017 that heavily featured memes and was initially met with success, resulting in an almost 50% profit growth that year; however, the strategy has also resulted in backfire when sharing memes that are controversial or otherwise negatively perceived by consumers. Within politics As internet memes become a common means of online expression, they become quickly used by those seeking to express political opinions, or to actively campaign for (or against) a political entity. Early examples of which can be seen from the internet memes resulting from the Dean Scream. Another example can be seen from MyDavidCameron.com, a website that allowed users to change the text of a British Conservative election campaign poster featuring David Cameron from the 2010 general election. This website often used to produce memes that replaced the original slogan with a series of exaggerated claims or sarcastic fake campaign promises along with derision of David Cameron's airbrushed appearance. Within each subsequent election, and the growing importance of visual communications due to the internet and social media, memes have become a more important element within political campaigns as fringe communities have shaped broader discourse through the use of internet memes. For example, Ted Cruz's 2016 Republican presidential bid was damaged by internet memes that speculated he was the Zodiac Killer. However, there has further been academic research that provides evidence that the use of memes during elections has a role to play in informing the public. In a study of 378 internet memes posted across Facebook during the 2017 general election, McLoughlin and Southern found memes were a widely shared conduit for basic political information to audiences who often did not seek it out. Indeed, a fifth of all political memes posted during election referenced a political policy which was part of a political parties mandate, while messages promoting people to vote were shared more than 160,000 times, suggesting memes have a small role to play in increasing voter turnout. Satirical memes that express political opinions are effective in not only informing others but also driving political debate and engagement with politics by offering an easy and even fun way to talk about important issues. This increasing importance of memes has been explicitly taken advantage of by some political campaigns; as part of the 2020 US presidential campaign, Michael Bloomberg sponsored a number of Instagram accounts with over 60 million collective followers to post memes related to the Bloomberg campaign. Similar to criticisms against corporations who use meme marketing, the campaign was faulted for treating meme culture as an advertisement or something that can be bought.  Copyright protection  Most memes are illegal to share in countries with fair dealing laws. The eligibility of any memes to get copyright protection depends on the copyright law of the country in which such protection is sought. Some of the most popular formats of memes include cinematographic stills, personal or stock photographs, rage comics, and illustrations meant to be a meme, and the copyright implications differ for each of these different formats. In a cinematographic still, part of the entire end product is taken out of context and presented solely for its face value. The still is generally accompanied by a superimposed text of which conveys a distinctive idea or comment, such as the Boromir meme or \\"Gru's Plan\\". Other memes are created based on online phenomena or individually- created content. Photographs of people or animals, especially stock photos, can be turned into memes by superimposing text, often to depict an emotion such as in the Distracted Boyfriend and Overly Attached Girlfriend memes. Rage comics are a subcategory of memes which depict a series of human emotions and conclude with a satirical punchline. The sources for these memes often come from webcomics. Other memes are purely viral sensations such as in Keyboard Cat and Bongo Cat. = United States = Under United States copyright law, a creation receives copyright protection if it satisfies four conditions under 17 U.S.C. § 102. For a meme to get copyright protection, it would have to satisfy four conditions: #It falls under one of the categories of work which is protected under the law #It is an \\"expression\\" #It has a modest amount of creativity #It is \\"fixed\\". 17 U.S.C. § 102 enumerates the subject matter over which copyright could be enjoyed namely, literary work, musical work; dramatic work; pictorial; graphical and cultural works; motion pictures, etc. Broadly, memes could fall under any of the heads of pictorial, graphical or motion picture. While ideas cannot get copyright protection, the expression of an idea can be; this is fundamental to copyright law, and means that the form and manner in which an idea is expressed is protected, not the idea itself. This was given in the case of Baker v. Selden. Since a meme is essentially a comment, satire, ridicule or expression of an emotion it constitutes the expression of an idea. For the meme to successfully claim protection, it would have to show that it is original work of the author and has a modest amount of creativity, since the United States has a low threshold of originality for what constitutes creativity, as demonstrated by Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co.. Since memes are comments about the popular culture or social ideas, there is generally some amount of creativity inherent in memes. Finally, 17 U.S.C. § 101 requires the work to be 'fixed,' meaning that it must be \\"sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated for a period of more than transitory nature\\". The medium here could be a book, musical recording, or video, and has also been widened to include publication on the Internet, therefore encompassing memes. = India = Under Section 2(c) of the Indian Copyright Act, 1957, a meme could be classified as an 'artistic work' which states that an artistic work includes painting, sculpture, drawing (including a diagram, map, chart or plan), an engraving or a photograph, whether or not any such work possesses artistic quality. The section uses the phrase \\"whether or not possessing artistic quality\\", the memes that are rage comics or those such as Keyboard Cat would enjoy protection as they are original creations in the form a painting, drawing, photograph or short video clip, despite not having artistic quality. Memes that made from cinematograph still or photographs, the original image in the background for the meme would also be protected as the picture or the still from the series/movie is an 'artistic work'. These meme are a modification of that already existing artistic work with some little amount of creativity and therefore, they would also enjoy copyright protection. = Copyright infringement and possible defenses = If it is found that the meme has made use of a copyrighted work, such as the movie still or photograph without due permission from the original owner, it would amount to copyright infringement. Rage comics and memes created for the sole purpose of becoming memes would normally be original works of the creator and therefore, the question of infringing other copyright work does not arise. This does not mean that all memes made from movie still or photographs are infringing copyright. There are defenses available for such use in various jurisdictions which could exempt the meme from attracting liability for the infringement.  Fair use in the United States  Fair use is a defense under 17 U.S.C. § 107 of the US Copyright Law which protects work that have made using other copyrighted works. The section provides that if a copyrighted work is reproduced \\"for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching [...] , scholarship or research\\", it would not amount to infringement. Notably for memes, the use of the term \\"such as\\" in the section denotes that the list is not exhaustive but merely illustrative. Furthermore, the factors mentioned in the section are subjective in nature and the weight of each factor varies on a case to case basis. All the factors have to be weighed together and an overall assessment is made whether the infringing work would qualify as fair use. The four factors are: #The purpose or character of use, #The nature of the copyrighted work, #The amount and substantiality of the portion used, and #Effect on the market. The purpose and character of the use involve how the original copyrighted work's purpose differs from the meme's purpose, as well as commercial uses of products that use copyrighted material. In Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. the court introduced the concept of transformation which goes into the inquiry whether the infringing work altered the original with a new expression, meaning or expression or merely superseded or supplanted the original work. Memes are transformative in nature as they have no relation to the original work and the motive behind the communication of the meme is personal, in terms of disseminating humor to the public. Such memes being transformative would be covered by fair use. However, copying memes that are made for the sole purpose of being memes would not enjoy this protection as there is no transformation- the copying has the same purpose as original meme which is communicate humorous anecdotes. Purpose and character of use weighs in against memes which have been used for commercial purposes because then the work has not been created for the communication of humor but for economic gain. For example, Grumpy Cat won $710,001 in a copyright lawsuit against the beverage company Grenade which used the Grumpy Cat image on its roasted coffee line and t-shirts. The nature of the copyrighted work weighs asks what the differences between the meme and the other material are. This factor applies to many types of memes because the original work is an artistic creation that has been published and thus the latter enjoys protection under copyright which the memes are violating. However, as memes are transformative, this factor does not have a lot of weight. The amount and substantiality of the portion used tests not only the quantity of the work copied but the quality that is copied as well.. Harper & Row v. Nation Enterprises clarified this position. For cinematograph still, only a small portion of the entire film is copied whereas for rage comics and personal photographs, the entire portion has been used to create the meme. Despite this, all categories of memes would be considered to be falling under fair use because the text that is added to those images adds value, without which it would just be picture. Moreover, the heart of the work is not affected because the still/picture is taken out of context and portrays something entirely different from what the image originally wanted to depict. Lastly, the effect on the market offers court analysis on whether the meme would cause harm to the actual market of the original copyright work and also the harm it could cause to the potential market. The target audience for the original work and meme is entirely different as the latter is taken out of the context of the original and created for the use and dissemination on social media. Rage comics and memes created for the purpose of being memes are an exception to this because the target audience for both is the same and copied work could infringe on the potential market of the original. Warner Brothers was sued for infringing the Nyan Cat meme by using it its game Scribblenauts.  Fair dealing in India  Any distribution of a work which has a copyright, wholly or partly, would constitute an infringing copy under Section 2(m)(i) of the Copyright Act, 1957. India follows a Fair Dealing approach as an exception to copyright infringement under Section 52(1)(a) for the purposes of private or personal use, criticism or review. The analysis requires three steps: the amount and substantiality of dealing, the purpose of copying, and the effect on potential markets. The amount of sustainability of dealing asks about how much of the original work is used in the meme, or how the meme transforms the original content. A meme makes use to existing copyright work whether it is a cinematograph still, rage comic, personal photograph or a meme made for the purpose of being a meme. However, since a meme is made for comedic purposes, taken out of context of the original work, they are transforming the work and creating a new work. The purpose of copying factors in the purpose of the meme compared to the purpose of the original work. Under Section 52(1)(a) the purpose is restricted to criticism or review. A meme, as long as it is a parody or a criticism of the original work would be protected under the exception but once an element of commercialization comes in, they would no longer be exempted and because the purpose no longer falls under the those mentioned in the section . When the Indian comedic group, All India Bakchod (AIB) parodied Game of Thrones through a series of memes, the primary purpose was to advertise products of companies that have endorsed the group and it would not be fair dealing. Memes generally do not have an effect on the potential market for a work. There must be no intention on part of the infringer to compete with the original owner of the work and derive profits from it. Since memes are generally meant for comedic value and have no intention to supplant the market of the original creator, they would be squarely fall within the ambit of this section.

Born in Forchheim near Karlsruhe, Germany, Oberle moved with his family to German-occupied Poland in 1941. There he was placed in a Hitler Youth indoctrination program. Later, he fled the Red Army advance, surviving on grass and stolen eggs while walking 800 kilometres to his home village in the Black Forest. Rejected by his relatives, he immigrated to Canada at the age of 19 and became a logger and then a gold miner. Oberle entered municipal politics, becoming mayor of Chetwynd. He entered federal politics and was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1972 general election as the Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament for Prince George—Peace River, British Columbia. He subsequently won re-election five times. In 1985, Oberle became the first German-born federal Canadian cabinet minister when he became Minister of State for Science and Technology in Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's government. He was science minister when the Canadarm went into space as part of the space shuttle program. He later became Minister of State for Forestry, and then Minister of Forestry in 1990. Oberle retired from Cabinet when Kim Campbell succeeded Mulroney as Prime Minister, and retired from politics with the dissolution of the 34th Canadian Parliament for the 1993 election. In 2004, Oberle published a memoir of his World War II experiences, Finding Home: A War Child’s Journey to Peace (2004). A second memoir, A Chosen Path: From Moccasin Flats to Parliament Hill, was published in the same year. His son Frank Oberle Jr. was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta in the 2004 provincial election, and was appointed Solicitor General on January 13, 2010.

Other potential jurors may be challenged for cause, i.e. by giving a good reason why they might be unable to reach a fair verdict, but the challenge will be considered by the presiding judge and may be denied. A peremptory challenge can be a major part of voir dire. A peremptory challenge also allows attorneys to veto a potential juror on a \\"hunch\\". The idea behind peremptory challenges is that if both parties have contributed in the configuration of the jury, they will find its verdict more acceptable. The existence of peremptory challenges is argued to be an important safeguard in the judicial process, allowing both the defendant and the prosecution to get rid of potentially biased jurors. Their use allows attorneys to use their training and experience to dismiss jurors who might say the correct thing, but might otherwise harbor prejudices that could infringe the rights of the defendant to a fair trial. Controversy The use of peremptory challenges is controversial as some feel it has been used to undermine the balanced representation on a jury which would occur using random selection. While courts are not allowed to strike out entire groups of people from a particular jury, some would argue that peremptory challenges give individual parties this power (Yeazell 624). This reach of power has allowed, and still can allow, attorneys to simply strike out groups of people, even if just on a whim (e.g. all football fans may be struck from the jury). However, in the criminal case Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986), it was held that the prosecution's actions of striking groups of people based on race violated parties' right to equal protection. This holding was further applied to civil cases in 1991 (Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U.S. 614 (1991)). Despite this, it still remains in use in several jurisdictions and in some cases leads to extensive and expensive jury research, aimed at producing a favorable jury. In the American legal system of the past, attorneys' power to exercise peremptory challenges was nearly unlimited; this fueled the controversy over whether this process tampered with the fairness of jury trial. In response, the American judicial system has begun to use restrictions. These restrictions have been put into place in different regions, some by statutes, some by common law (i.e. case decisions) (Yeazell 624). A further criticism of this kind of jury selection is that it makes it easier to achieve a conviction, which critics argue leads to a higher chance of wrongful convictions. In most (if not all) jury systems a super-majority (or unanimity) is required to convict (e.g. in the UK over 83% of jurors are required for a conviction - a 10 to 2 majority can be accepted if a unanimous decision cannot be reached). If both sides are able to challenge jurors one would expect the prosecution to try to remove those with a general tendency to wish to acquit. Of course one would expect the defense to challenge those they think have a general tendency to convict, but if both sides do their job equally well then the tendency will be to turn what would have been a small majority (one way or the other) into a strong majority in the same direction, potentially causing the proportion to rise over the super-majority threshold required. This effect can be (and often is) partially mitigated by giving the defense more peremptory challenges than the prosecution (e.g. when indicted on a felony in the USA the defense gets 10 challenges to the prosecution's 6).  Jurisdictions historically or currently using peremptory challenges  Argentina = The majority of the provinces in Argentina allow four peremptories per side and limitless challenges for cause during the voir dire. = Australia = All Australian states allow for peremptory challenges in jury selection; however, the number of challenges granted to the counsels can vary between states. = Canada = The rules regarding peremptory challenges in Canada were laid out in §634 of the Criminal Code of Canada. The number of challenges awarded to each of the prosecutor and the defense depended on the type of charge and maximum potential sentence. Twenty challenges were awarded in cases for high treason and first degree murder, twelve challenges for offenses with a maximum penalty greater than five years, and four challenges for jury eligible offenses with a penalty of five years or less; However, in cases where the judge orders that thirteen or fourteen jurors be sworn in as opposed to the usual twelve, both the prosecution and the defense received one additional challenge per additional juror seat. §634 of the Criminal Code of Canada was repealed by Bill C-75 which came into effect on September 19, 2019, and peremptory challenges have been therefore eliminated. = England = Peremptory challenges were first used in England not many years after the assizes of Clarendon of 1166 allowed jury trials. When the concept was first introduced into the jury system, the maximum number of peremptory challenges allowed was thirty-five. As time went on, this number was reduced, and by the year 1509 the maximum number of peremptory challenges was twenty. By 1977, the number of peremptory challenges granted to each side was reduced from seven to three. The right of peremptory challenge was abolished altogether by the Criminal Justice Act 1988,Criminal Justice Act 1988, s.118(1) which saw it as a derogation from the principle of random selection, and felt that its removal would increase the fairness of the jury system. = Hong Kong = Peremptory challenges are permitted in Hong Kong. Unlike England, no statutory change has been made to abolish the right. Each party of the defence is entitled to challenge up to a maximum of five jurors without providing cause.Section 29, Jury Ordinance =Ireland= Peremptory challenges (referred to as \\"challenge without cause shown\\") are permitted in Ireland, with each side being allowed seven such challenges.Section 20, Juries Act, 1976 = New Zealand = Each party is entitled to four peremptory challenges in New Zealand, and where there are two or more accused the prosecution is provided with a maximum of eight. = Northern Ireland = Unlike the rest of the United Kingdom, peremptory challenge survived in Northern Ireland into the twenty-first century. The Juries (Northern Ireland) Order 1996Juries (Northern Ireland) Order 1996, s.13-17 entitled each party to a maximum of six peremptory challenges in civil cases. In criminal cases, each defendant was entitled to a maximum of twelve peremptory challenges; however, the prosecution could only challenge for cause. Northern Ireland was brought into line with England & Wales, and with Scotland when peremptory challenge was finally abolished in 2007.Justice and Security (Northern Ireland) Act 2007, s.13 = United States = All jurisdictions in the United States (including the Virgin Islands) allow for peremptory challenges; the number depends on the jurisdiction and the type of case (i.e., more challenges may be permitted in a murder case than for DWI). In the United States, the use of peremptory challenges by criminal prosecutors to remove persons from a cognizable group (i.e., of one race, ethnicity, or gender) based solely on that group characteristic has been ruled to be unconstitutional in Batson v. Kentucky, . The term \\"Batson challenge\\" is used to refer to the act of arguing for the invalidity of a trial on the basis that peremptory challenges during jury selection resulted in the exclusion of a cognizable group. Batson′s authority has also recently been reinforced in a pair of 2005 decisions, Miller-El v. Dretke, , and Johnson v. California, . Furthermore, in 2009 the United States Supreme Court found in a unanimous opinion in Rivera v. Illinois that \\"there is no freestanding constitutional right to peremptory challenges,\\" even when a court was mistaken in applying Batson. Some jurisdictions have expanded the Batson rule to forbid the peremptory challenges based on gender, ethnicity, or religion. As of 2014, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has held that a peremptory challenge based on perceived sexual orientation is unconstitutional.  Peremptory challenge of judge  Another form of the peremptory challenge (or peremptory disqualification), available in some jurisdictions, is the right to remove a judge assigned to hear the case without showing that the judge is actually biased or had a conflict of interest. While actual determination of a judge's bias is not required to employ the peremptory challenge, the moving party must still allege bias under oath. In jurisdictions that have this form of peremptory challenge, it generally may only be used once per party per case. (See, e.g., Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 170.6.)

Being selective for beta1 receptors, it typically has fewer systemic side effects than non-selective beta-blockers, for example, not causing bronchospasm (mediated by beta2 receptors) as timolol may. Betaxolol also shows greater affinity for beta1 receptors than metoprolol. In addition to its effect on the heart, betaxolol reduces the pressure within the eye (intraocular pressure). This effect is thought to be caused by reducing the production of the liquid (which is called the aqueous humor) within the eye. The precise mechanism of this effect is not known. The reduction in intraocular pressure reduces the risk of damage to the optic nerve and loss of vision in patients with elevated intraocular pressure due to glaucoma.

He served as the athletic director at the University of Michigan from 1968 to 1988. There, he became nationally renowned for his ability to market and sell products bearing the name or logo of the school. In December 1968, he hired Bo Schembechler as head football coach, beginning a new era of success for Michigan's football program. The combination of Canham's aggressive marketing efforts and Schembechler's winning teams helped Michigan set many national attendance records at Michigan Stadium. Since 1975, the school has sold over 100,000 tickets for every home football game—a string of more than 200 contests. Education At the University of Michigan, Canham was an athlete for the Michigan Wolverines men's track and field team, earning All-American honors by winning the 1940 NCAA title in the high jump and was both the indoor and outdoor Big Ten Conference champion in both 1940 and 1941. Canham completed his bachelor's degree in physical education, history, and science at Michigan in 1941 and Master of Arts degree at Michigan in 1948. Coach From 1947 to 1968, he served as the school's head track coach. His teams won 11 Big Ten Conference championships, seven indoor and four outdoor. He left the post after 21 seasons to become the school's athletic director. Athletic director One of Canham's first priorities upon being named athletic director was to address the dwindling attendance at Michigan home football games, which by 1967 had declined to an average of 67,000 fans per game. Canham's good friend, Notre Dame athletic director Moose Krause, knew a sure-fire way to fill Michigan Stadium -- by playing Notre Dame. The Fighting Irish and the Wolverines had not met on the gridiron since 1943 when Fritz Crisler, Michigan's then football coach and athletic director until 1968 when Canham succeeded him, became so incensed at the intensity of Notre Dame's Frank Leahy that he never scheduled Notre Dame again. Canham and Krause worked out an agreement to renew the series, which resumed in 1978 and ended in 2014. In 1969, Canham had AstroTurf installed in the Michigan Stadium to replace its grass playing surface. The school continued to use similar artificial fields until 1990. This accounts for Canham's mention in Michigan radio sportscaster Bob Ufer's phrase for the stadium: \\"The hole that Yost dug, Crisler paid for, Canham carpeted and Schembechler fills up every Saturday!\\" In 1982, Canham was reported to be leading a group of investors looking to purchase the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League. Canham had preliminary meetings with the Norris family, although the franchise was eventually sold to Mike Ilitch.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qHgiAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=Aq0FAAAAIBAJ&pg;=2433%2C1140406 A football signed by Don Canham, Bo Schembechler, and Wally Teninga that was gifted to President Gerald Ford.

Canham died May 3, 2005 at the age of 87 after rupturing his abdominal aorta.

In the English versions of the games, Ratchet is voiced by Mikey Kelley in the first Ratchet & Clank and by James Arnold Taylor since. Appearances Ratchet is a Lombax, originally born on the Lombax homeworld of Planet Fastoon in the Polaris Galaxy but later sent to Planet Veldin in the Solana Galaxy by his father to protect him from Emperor Tachyon. Growing up on Veldin, Ratchet longed to travel to new worlds and even built his own ship. Shortly after completing his ship, Ratchet met a diminutive robot fugitive whom he dubbed Clank, who helped him to leave Veldin and fulfil his dream of travelling. From this point on, Ratchet and Clank travelled extensively through the Solana, Bogon and Polaris Galaxies, saving them on several occasions. Ratchet tends to be quite headstrong and usually is not afraid to voice his opinion. During the first game he had quite a short temper, which he had learned to control in later titles. Yet at the same time, Ratchet can be self-conscious and often appears concerned with how people view him. He is also deeply attached to his friends, although at times this relationship can be strained. Ratchet also appears as a playable character in Hot Shots Golf Fore!, Jak X: Combat Racing, PlayStation Move Heroes, PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale and the PlayStation 4 version of Super Bomberman R. Design Ratchet was originally envisioned by Insomniac Games Vice President of Programming Brian Hastings as a space-traveling reptile alien who would collect various weapons as he progressed through the game; Ratchet's final form was decided upon after Insomniac looked at various terrestrial creatures, such as dogs and rats, and feline features stood out to them because of the sense of agility associated with it. In response to the negative critical reception of Ratchet's design and personality in Ratchet & Clank, Ratchet's personality was altered in Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando to be \\"less cocky, [...] much more friendly to Clank, and [...] able to handle himself better in stressful situations without being impetuous\\". Reception On Mikey Kelley's vocal performance as Ratchet in Ratchet & Clank, Douglass C. Perry of IGN commented that \\"while Ratchet strives for that perfect dude-like teenager vibe, the voice actor generally hits the mark.\\" Ratchet's in-game model in Ratchet & Clank, particularly his facial animations and fur, was praised by Louis Bedigian of GameZone. Gavin Frankle of Allgame found it hard to form an emotional bond with Ratchet or Clank, saying that Ratchet is \\"your typical teenager [...] who desires nothing more than excitement and adventure\\". Benjamin Turner of GameSpy was highly critical of Ratchet in his review of the first game, citing his uninteresting aesthetic design and rude, immature and immoral demeanor as reasons for his ire. Johnny Liu of Game Revolution noted that Ratchet \\"starts out with a blue-collar attitude, but he's mostly there for deft observations and cutting remarks\\" and appreciated Ratchet not being \\"pigeonholed as a typical goody-goody\\", but concluded that he wasn't very fleshed out. Critics took note of Ratchet's improved character in subsequent games. Perry commented that Ratchet \\"is no longer an angry, selfish teenage furry creature from outer space. He's a commando, a little wiser, a little more forgiving and a lot more palatable. Though still furry...\\" Carlos McElfish of GameZone, describing Ratchet's in the previous game as a \\"laughably confident, smart-alecky hot-shot\\", commented that Ratchet's new voice forces a psychological reset in the minds of players. Jeremy Dunham of IGN noted that Ratchet's \\"Why me?\\" delivery is \\"spot on.\\" Ratchet was voted as the sixteenth top character of the 2000s decade by Game Informer's readers. In 2011, readers of Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition voted Ratchet as the 15th-top video game character of all time.

This contains a 550L biofence photobioreactor and a 1200L raceway pond system, as well as a range of smaller bubble column reactor systems at 3.5L and 11L capacity for smaller scale algal production. These facilities are regularly used to generate dried algal biomass on the scale of grams to hundreds of grams. This algal innovation centre also investigates a range of downstream processing techniques for algal harvesting. In addition to large- scale investigations, PML has a Single Cell Genomics facility: a dedicated clean room environment for single cell isolation, equipped with a high speed Atomic Force Microscope, cell-sorting flow cytometry capabilities and a number of liquid-handling machines. PML has a wholly owned trading subsidiary, PML Applications Ltd., which has been created to facilitate the exploitation and application of PML research and its products and to provide a more appropriate interface for working with end users, industrial and commercial partners.  History  The Plymouth Marine Laboratory was founded in 1988, mainly due to the recommendations of a House of Lords Report. It was formed by drawing some elements of the Laboratory of the Marine Biological Association (MBA) with the NERC Institute for Marine Environmental Research (IMER). On 1 April 2002, PML changed from being a wholly owned NERC research centre to an independent organisation with charitable status.

The population estimate was 680 in 1991, and in 2001 there were 566 registered voters. At the 2011 Census the population was 746. The village covers 1422.547 acres (5.8 km²) and is in an agricultural region of high quality fruit farming, hops and grain. Location Hartlip is situated between the M2 motorway (Strood to Canterbury) and the A2 main road from London to Canterbury. It is at Hartlip Hill, between Rainham and Newington on Watling Street, the old Roman road. It stands about 50 m above sea level. Ordnance Survey grid reference: TQ 838 642 GB.http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/?gazString=hartlip Name The name Hartlip derives from the Old English hliep, which meant a gate or fence. In combination with heorot (hart or stag), the name therefore means a \\"gate over which harts leap\\". The first recorded version of the name was Heordlyp in the 11th century.https://www.bbc.co.uk/kent/places/names/names_h.shtml Places of interest Queendown Warren is a nature reserve in the village. The reserve covers almost 80 hectares (198 acres) and comprises several distinct sections. The original reserve was a rabbit warren in mediaeval times and forms the reserve's core. It has been open downland for many hundreds of years and has an internationally important community of grassland orchids. Buildings There are the remains of an extensive Roman villa discovered in Danes Field. Hartlip parish church, named St. Michael and All Angels, is built of flint and has a peal of 6 bells. The oldest bell, number 5, was cast by Robert Burford between 1392 and circa 1418. The church registers go back to 1538. The village also has a Cardiphonia United Methodist church, built in 1821. Hartlip Endowed Church of England Primary School is one of the oldest establishments for primary education in North East Kent. It was endowed in 1678 by Mary Gibbon and rebuilt in 1855. It is situated next to the parish church, with an adjoining gateway. The only public house is the Rose and Crown. It is situated at the lower end of Hollow Lane, whose name is reputed to come from a secret tunnel leading to it from the church. The countryside around Hartlip held in the past, three manor houses: Yaugher, Hartlip & Grayney. From these manors remain two manor houses. Yaugher had the manor house Queendown Warren. This was built in 1560 using oak bought from Henry VIII. In 1841 the owner chose to move the house to a new site. The local wagoner & his men took down the house and moved it a few miles to its present location on Queendown Warren alongside the nature reserve. Hartlip Place was built in 1809 replacing a former one built 500 years earlier, which had fallen into disrepair.

The BRDM is a four-wheeled amphibious vehicle which is very lightly armoured by today's standards. Both versions were produced in the Soviet Union and other Eastern Bloc countries. Both versions came in an ATGM variant. The BRDM-2 also came as a command vehicle and as an air defence vehicle. BRDM-1 BRDM-1 with 7.62mm SGMB machine gun The BRDM-1 (also known as the BTR-40P) first appeared in 1959, and was in production until 1966. Total production was around 10,000 vehicles; less than 600 remain in the reserves of a number of countries. It was armed with a pintle-mounted heavy machine gun. The initial version of the vehicle, the Model 1957, had an open roof, but the standard production model, the Model 1958, had a roof with twin hatches. The vehicle was used as the basis of the 2P27 anti-tank missile launcher, using AT-1 Snapper missiles mounted in a retractable launcher. BRDM-2 Iraqi BRDM-2 at the U.S. National Infantry Museum, Fort Benning The BRDM-2 was intended to replace the earlier BRDM-1 with a vehicle that had improved amphibious capabilities and better armament. The BRDM-2 is driven by a rear-mounted gasoline engine that also supplies power to a waterjet for amphibious travel. It has a crew of four, a driver, co-driver, commander, and gunner. The armament is the same as the BTR-60 armoured personnel carrier, a 14.5 mm KPV heavy machine gun with a 7.62 mm machine gun as a secondary weapon. The armor on the vehicle protects fully against small arms fire and artillery shell splinters. This vehicle has been exported extensively and is in use in at least 45 countries. The BRDM-2 is sometimes confused with the Hungarian D-442 FUG amphibious scout car and the D-944 PSZH APC, which have rear engines but also have twin waterjets. The 9K31 Strela-1 (NATO name \\"Gaskin\\") mobile surface-to-air missile system is based on a modified BRDM-2 (4 x 4) amphibious chassis with its belly wheels removed. The original turret has been replaced by a one-man turret with an elevating arm on each side. Mounted to each arm is a box-type launcher for the SA-9 fire-and-forget missiles. To reduce the overall height of the system for travelling, the missiles are normally lowered into the horizontal position on each side of the vehicle. BRDM-3 Although some Western sources use the designator BRDM-3 for the 9P148—an anti-tank variant of the BRDM-2 with ATGM launcher—the BRDM-3 is in fact based on the BTR-80AK and with a new day/night vision device in front of the commander's position. The crew consists of 6 men.

It was built partially on the site of RAF Chilbolton, which was decommissioned in 1946. Several sites around the south-east of England were considered for the construction. The site at Chilbolton, on the edge of Salisbury Plain, was chosen in part because of excellent visibility of the horizon and its relative remoteness from major roads whose cars could cause interference. The facility was opened in April 1967. Within several months of being commissioned the azimuth bearing of the antenna suffered a catastrophic failure. GEC were contracted to repair the bearing and devised a system to replace the failed part while leaving the 400 tonne dish ostensibly in-place. Originally, the antenna was engaged in Ku band radio astronomy, but now operates as a S and L band radar.

It is used to measure the timing of cells on virtual channels (VCs) and or Virtual Paths (VPs) against bandwidth and jitter limits contained in a traffic contract for the VC or VP to which the cells belong. Cells that do not conform to the limits given by the traffic contract may then be re- timed (delayed) in traffic shaping, or may be dropped (discarded) or reduced in priority (demoted) in traffic policing. Nonconforming cells that are reduced in priority may then be dropped, in preference to higher priority cells, by downstream components in the network that are experiencing congestion. Alternatively they may reach their destination (VC or VP termination) if there is enough capacity for them, despite them being excess cells as far as the contract is concerned: see priority control. The GCRA is given as the reference for checking the traffic on connections in the network, i.e. usage/network parameter control (UPC/NPC) at user–network interfaces (UNI) or inter-network interfaces or network-network interfaces (INI/NNI) . It is also given as the reference for the timing of cells transmitted (ATM PDU Data_Requests) onto an ATM network by a network interface card (NIC) in a host, i.e. on the user side of the UNI . This ensures that cells are not then discarded by UPC/NCP in the network, i.e. on the network side of the UNI. However, as the GCRA is only given as a reference, the network providers and users may use any other algorithm that gives the same result. Description of the GCRA Figure 1: Equivalent versions of the generic cell rate algorithm The GCRA is described by the ATM Forum in its User-Network Interface (UNI) and by the ITU-T in recommendation I.371 Traffic control and congestion control in B-ISDN . Both sources describe the GCRA in two equivalent ways: as a virtual scheduling algorithm and as a continuous state leaky bucket algorithm (figure 1). =Leaky bucket description= The description in terms of the leaky bucket algorithm may be the easier of the two to understand from a conceptual perspective, as it is based on a simple analogy of a bucket with a leak: see figure 1 on the leaky bucket page. However, there has been confusion in the literature over the application of the leaky bucket analogy to produce an algorithm, which has crossed over to the GCRA. The GCRA should be considered as a version of the leaky bucket as a meter rather than the leaky bucket as a queue. However, while there are possible advantages in understanding this leaky bucket description, it does not necessarily result in the best (fastest) code if implemented directly. This is evidenced by the relative number of actions to be performed in the flow diagrams for the two descriptions (figure 1). The description in terms of the continuous state leaky bucket algorithm is given by the ITU-T as follows: “The continuous-state leaky bucket can be viewed as a finite capacity bucket whose real-valued content drains out at a continuous rate of 1 unit of content per time unit and whose content is increased by the increment T for each conforming cell... If at a cell arrival the content of the bucket is less than or equal to the limit value τ, then the cell is conforming; otherwise, the cell is non-conforming. The capacity of the bucket (the upper bound of the counter) is (T + τ)” . It is worth noting that because the leak is one unit of content per unit time, the increment for each cell T and the limit value τ are in units of time. Considering the flow diagram of the continuous state leaky bucket algorithm, in which T is the emission interval and τ is the limit value: What happens when a cell arrives is that the state of the bucket is calculated from its state when the last conforming cell arrived, X, and how much has leaked out in the interval, ta – LCT. This current bucket value is then stored in X' and compared with the limit value τ. If the value in X' is not greater than τ, the cell did not arrive too early and so conforms to the contract parameters; if the value in X' is greater than τ, then it does not conform. If it conforms then, if it conforms because it was late, i.e. the bucket empty (X' <= 0), X is set to T; if it was early, but not too early, (τ >= X' > 0), X is set to X' + T. Thus the flow diagram mimics the leaky bucket analogy (used as a meter) directly, with X and X' acting as the analogue of the bucket. = Virtual scheduling description = The virtual scheduling algorithm, while not so obviously related to such an easily accessible analogy as the leaky bucket, gives a clearer understanding of what the GCRA does and how it may be best implemented. As a result, direct implementation of this version can result in more compact, and thus faster, code than a direct implementation of the leaky bucket description. The description in terms of the virtual scheduling algorithm is given by the ITU-T as follows: “The virtual scheduling algorithm updates a Theoretical Arrival Time (TAT), which is the 'nominal' arrival time of the cell assuming cells are sent equally spaced at an emission interval of T corresponding to the cell rate Λ [= 1/T] when the source is active. If the actual arrival time of a cell is not 'too early' relative to the TAT and tolerance τ associated to the cell rate, i.e. if the actual arrival time is after its theoretical arrive time minus the limit value (ta > TAT – τ), then the cell is conforming; otherwise, the cell is nonconforming\\" . If the cell is nonconforming then TAT is left unchanged. If the cell is conforming, and arrived before its TAT (equivalent to the bucket not being empty but being less than the limit value), then the next cell's TAT is simply TAT + T. However, if a cell arrives after its TAT, then the TAT for the next cell is calculated from this cell's arrival time, not its TAT. This prevents credit building up when there is a gap in the transmission (equivalent to the bucket becoming less than empty). This version of the algorithm works because τ defines how much earlier a cell can arrive than it would if there were no jitter: see leaky bucket: delay variation tolerance. Another way to see it is that TAT represents when the bucket will next empty, so a time τ before that is when the bucket is exactly filled to the limit value. So, in either view, if it arrives more than τ before TAT, it is too early to conform. =Comparison with the token bucket= The GCRA, unlike implementations of the token bucket algorithm, does not simulate the process of updating the bucket (the leak or adding tokens regularly). Rather, each time a cell arrives it calculates the amount by which the bucket will have leaked since its level was last calculated or when the bucket will next empty (= TAT). This is essentially replacing the leak process with a (realtime) clock, which most hardware implementations are likely to already have. This replacement of the process with an RTC is possible because ATM cells have a fixed length (53 bytes), thus T is always a constant, and the calculation of the new bucket level (or of TAT) does not involve any multiplication or division. As a result, the calculation can be done quickly in software, and while more actions are taken when a cell arrives than are taken by the token bucket, in terms of the load on a processor performing the task, the lack of a separate update process more than compensates for this. Moreover, because there is no simulation of the bucket update, there is no processor load at all when the connection is quiescent. However, if the GCRA were to be used to limit to a bandwidth, rather than a packet/frame rate, in a protocol with variable length packets (Link Layer PDUs), it would involve multiplication: basically the value added to the bucket (or to TAT) for each conforming packet would have to be proportionate to the packet length: whereas, with the GCRA as described, the water in the bucket has units of time, for variable length packets it would have to have units that are the product of packet length and time. Hence, applying the GCRA to limit the bandwidth of variable length packets without access to a fast, hardware multiplier (as in an FPGA) may not be practical. However, it can always be used to limit the packet or cell rate, as long as their lengths are ignored.  Dual Leaky Bucket Controller  Multiple implementations of the GCRA can be applied concurrently to a VC or a VP, in a dual leaky bucket traffic policing or traffic shaping function, e.g. applied to a Variable Bit Rate (VBR) VC. This can limit ATM cells on this VBR VC to a Sustained Cell Rate (SCR) and a Maximum Burst Size (MBS). At the same time, the dual leaky bucket traffic policing function can limit the rate of cells in the bursts to a Peak Cell Rate (PCR) and a maximum Cell Delay Variation tolerance (CDVt): see Traffic Contract#Traffic Parameters. Figure 2: Example cell timings on a VBR connection This may be best understood where the transmission on an VBR VC is in the form of fixed length messages (CPCS-PDUs), which are transmitted with some fixed interval or the Inter Message Time (IMT) and take a number of cells, MBS, to carry them; however, the description of VBR traffic and the use of the dual leaky bucket are not restricted to such situations. In this case, the average cell rate over the interval of IMT is the SCR (=MBS/IMT). The individual messages can be transmitted at a PCR, which can be any value between the bandwidth for the physical link (1/δ) and the SCR. This allows the message to be transmitted in a period that is smaller than the message interval IMT, with gaps between instances of the message. Figure 3: Reference algorithm for Sustainable Cell Rate (SCR) and Peak Cell Rate (PCR) for CLP = 0 + 1 cell flow In the dual leaky bucket, one bucket is applied to the traffic with an emission interval of 1/SCR and a limit value τSCR that gives an MBS that is the number of cells in the message: see leaky bucket#Maximum burst size. The second bucket has an emission interval of 1/PCR and a limit value τPCR that allows for the CDV up to that point in the path of the connection: see leaky bucket#Delay Variation Tolerance. Cells are then allowed through at the PCR, with jitter of τPCR, up to a maximum number of MBS cells. The next burst of MBS cells will then be allowed through starting MBS x 1/SCR after the first. If the cells arrive in a burst at a rate higher than 1/PCR (MBS cells arrive in less than (MBS - 1)/PCR - τPCR), or more than MBS cells arrive at the PCR, or bursts of MBS cells arrive closer than IMT apart, the dual leaky bucket will detect this and delay (shaping) or drop or de- prioritize (policing) enough cells to make the connection conform. Figure 3 shows the reference algorithm for SCR and PCR control for both Cell Loss Priority (CLP) values 1 (low) and 0 (high) cell flows, i.e. where the cells with both priority values are treated the same. Similar reference algorithms where the high and low priority cells are treated differently are also given in Annex A to I.371 .

Life and career Elliott was born in 1931 in Brooklyn, New York, United States, the son of Florence (Rieger) and Abraham Adnopoz, an eminent doctor. His family was Jewish. He attended Midwood High School in Brooklyn and graduated in 1949. Elliott grew up inspired by the rodeos at Madison Square Garden, and wanted to be a cowboy. Encouraged instead to follow his father's example and become a surgeon, Elliott rebelled, running away from home at the age of 15 to join Col. Jim Eskew's Rodeo, the only rodeo east of the Mississippi. They traveled throughout the Mid-Atlantic states and New England. He was with them for only three months before his parents tracked him down and had him sent home, but Elliott was exposed to his first singing cowboy, Brahmer Rogers, a rodeo clown who played guitar and five-string banjo, sang songs, and recited poetry. Back home, Elliott taught himself guitar and started busking for a living. Eventually he got together with Woody Guthrie and stayed with him as an admirer and student. With banjo player Derroll Adams, he toured the United Kingdom and Europe. By 1960, he had recorded three folk albums for the UK record label Topic Records. In London, he played small clubs and pubs by day and West End cabaret nightclubs at night. When he returned to the States, Elliott found he had become renowned in American folk music circles. Woody Guthrie had the greatest influence on Elliott. Guthrie's son, Arlo, said that because of Woody's illness and early death, Arlo never really got to know him, but learned his father's songs and performing style from Elliott. Elliott's guitar and his mastery of Guthrie's material had a big impact on Bob Dylan when he lived in Minneapolis.Dylan paid tribute to Elliott's music in Chronicles, Vol. 1, pp 250-252 When he reached New York, Dylan was sometimes referred to as the 'son' of Jack Elliott, because Elliott had a way of introducing Dylan's songs with the words: \\"Here's a song from my son, Bob Dylan.\\" Dylan rose to prominence as a songwriter; Elliott continued as an interpretative troubadour, bringing old songs to new audiences in his idiosyncratic manner. Elliott also influenced Phil Ochs, and played guitar and sang harmony on Ochs' cover of the song \\"Joe Hill\\" from the Tape from California album. Elliott also discovered singer-songwriter Guthrie Thomas in a bar in Northern California in 1973, bringing Thomas to Hollywood where Thomas' music career began. Elliott appeared in Dylan's 1975-1976 Rolling Thunder Revue concert tour, and played \\"Longheno de Castro\\" in Dylan's movie Renaldo and Clara accompanied by guitarist Arlen Roth. In the movie, he sings the song \\"South Coast\\" by Lillian Bos Ross and Sam Eskin, from whose lyric the character's name is derived.\\"South Coast\\" lyrics - Arlo.net, Arlo Guthrie's website Elliott also appears briefly in the 1983 film Breathless, starring Richard Gere and directed by Jim McBride. Elliott plays guitar in a traditional flatpicking style, which he matches with his laconic, humorous storytelling, often accompanying himself on harmonica. His singing has a strained, nasal quality which the young Bob Dylan emulated. His repertoire includes American traditional music from various genres, including country, blues, bluegrass and folk. Elliott's nickname comes not from his traveling habits, but rather the countless stories he relates before answering the simplest of questions. Folk singer Odetta claimed that her mother gave him the name, remarking, \\"Oh, Jack Elliott, yeah, he can sure ramble on!\\" His authenticity as a folksy, down-to-earth country boy, despite being a Jewish doctor's son from Brooklyn, and his disdain for other folk singers, were parodied by the Folksmen (Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer) in the satirical documentary A Mighty Wind in the name of their \\"hit\\" album Ramblin'. A Mighty Wind also referred to a former member of the New Main Street Singers, Ramblin' Sandy Pitnick, a somewhat geeky-looking white man in a cowboy hat, apparently in parody of Elliott. Elliott's first recording in many years, South Coast, earned him his first Grammy Award in 1995. He was awarded the National Medal of Arts in 1998. His long career and strained relationship with his daughter Aiyana were chronicled in her 2000 film documentary, The Ballad of Ramblin' Jack. At the age of 75, he changed labels and released I Stand Alone on the ANTI- label, with an assortment of guest backup players including members of Wilco, X, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The album was produced by Ian Brennan. Jack said his intention was to title the album Not for the Tourists, because it was recorded partially in response to his daughter's request for songs he loved but never played in concert. When asked why he did not, he told her, \\"These songs are not for the tourists.\\" In 2012 he was featured on the song \\"Double Lifetime\\" on the album Older Than My Old Man Now by Loudon Wainwright III. In September 2016, Rolling Stone reported that he will appear alongside Bob Weir, on Weir's new solo album Blue Mountain, on the track \\"Ki-Yi Bossie\\".

The name is earned from the large number of restaurants, takeaways and kebab houses specialising in the cuisines of South Asia and the Middle East, thought to be the largest concentration of South Asian restaurants outside the Indian subcontinent. Within a length of half a mile there are least seventy establishments of this kind. The Curry Mile is notable for its streets being busy into the early hours of the morning. The area is frequently visited by local students, because of its location near the Oxford Road and Fallowfield Campuses of the University of Manchester, Xaverian College and the Oxford Road/All Saints campus of the Manchester Metropolitan University. On film In May 1995, Aneel Ahmed and Faisal A. Qureshi wrote Movin As A Massive, a Channel 4 documentary written for the Lloyds Bank Film Challenge, of which it was the winning entry. It also won the 1996 \\"Race in the Media Award\\" for Best Youth Programme, and was nominated by the Royal Television Society in 1996 for \\"Most Innovative Film/Video\\". It was directed by Ninder Billing, and produced by Andy Porter and Madeline French for Compulsive Viewing. A semi sequel, Wimmy Road, was later written for BBC Radio Drama by Qureshi and directed by Nadia Molinari. It was nominated for a \\"Race in the Media Award\\" for Best Radio Drama. The Curry Mile was the main filming location for the episode Serving the Community (1997) from the television series Hetty Wainthropp Investigates.

V-Day began on February 14, 1998, when the very first V-Day benefit performance of Ensler's play The Vagina Monologues took place in NYC, raising over $250k for local anti-violence groups. V-Day was formed and became a 501(c)(3) organization with a mission to raise funds and awareness to end violence against all women and girls (cisgender, transgender, and those who hold fluid identities that are subject to gender based violence). Through V-Day, activists stage royalty free, benefit performances of The Vagina Monologues \\"to fund local programs, support safe houses, rape crisis centers, and domestic violence shelters, change laws to protect women and girls, and educate local communities to raise awareness and change social attitudes toward violence against women\\" during the month February, with most of the benefit productions taking place on or about February 14. Ensler has been quoted as saying that it was women's reactions to the play that inspired her and her colleagues to launch V-Day. The 'V' in V-Day stands for Victory, Valentine and Vagina. Since it launched, thousands of V-Day events have taken place and raised “over 100 million dollars for anti-violence programs across the globe and staged events in more than 200 countries.” V-Day helped launch and supports the City of Joy in Congo – “a transformational leadership community for women survivors of violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is owned and run by local Congolese—as well as One Billion Rising, the biggest annual mass action to end violence against women in history.\\"  About V-Day  Since its inception, the movement has expanded its use of art and activism to include screenings and reading — most notably of the documentary Until The Violence Stops (2004) and the compilation A Memory, Monologue, A Rant, and a Prayer. Marches and festivals that have been held as part of the movement include UNTIL THE VIOLENCE STOPS: NYC (June 2006), and the ten-year anniversary V TO THE TENTH at the Louisiana Superdome and New Orleans Arena in 2008. Beginning in early 2001, V-Day activities expanded to the international stage, with V-Day hosting leadership summits for women in Afghanistan and a gathering of activists in Rome. V-Day also launched the Karama program in the Middle East and coordinated community briefings on the missing and murdered women of Juarez, Mexico. In some societies where censorship forbids performances of The Vagina Monologues, events revolve around other works developed by V-Day, including the book A Memory, a Monologue, a Rant, and a Prayer, an anthology of writings about violence against women. V-Day included the first ever all transgender version of The Vagina Monologues in 2004, with a performance by eighteen notable trans women under the mentoring of Jane Fonda and Andrea James of Deep Stealth Productions. There are 12 international coordinators who work within their regions to organize events for V-Day. Rada Borić, a Croatian academic, organizes the former Eastern Bloc region. Consistent growth of the movement led to 5,400 events in 1,500 locations taking place in 2010 alone. It was then estimated that $80 million had been raised since the movement's inception with over 12,000 community-based anti- violence programs and safe houses in The Congo, Haiti, Kenya, Egypt and Iraq receiving funding.  Mission  V-Day aims to tackle issues such as rape and battery of women, incest, female genital mutilation and human trafficking of female sex slaves. The organization seeks to strengthen existing anti-violence efforts by raising money and consciousness, and to lay the groundwork for new educational and protective legislative endeavours for women throughout the world. V-Day's work is grounded in four core beliefs. These stated as: *Art has the power to transform thinking and inspire people to act. *Lasting social and cultural change is spread by ordinary people doing extraordinary things. *Local women best know what their communities need and can become unstoppable leaders. *One must look at the intersection of race, class, and gender to understand violence against women.  V-Day campaigns  There are two types of V-Campaigns: The College Campaign and the Community Campaign. Through these V-Day campaigns, local volunteers and college students produce annual benefit performances of The Vagina Monologues, A Memory, A Monologue, A Rant and A Prayer and Any One of Us: Words From Prison. They also offer screenings of the V-Day documentary Until The Violence Stops and the PBS documentary What I Want My Words to Do to You, and conduct Spotlight Campaign Teach-Ins and V-Men workshops, to raise awareness and funds for anti-violence groups within their communities. Each year V-Day spotlights a particular group of women who are experiencing violence with the goal of putting a worldwide media spotlight on this area and to raise funds to aide groups who are addressing it. For example, V-Day advocated for change throughout the Congo in 2007 by launching the Stop Raping Our Greatest Resource: Power To The Women and Girls of the Democratic Republic of Congo campaign. The 2011 spotlight focused on the women and girls of Haiti. In this year, the efforts in the Congo led to the opining of the survivors community City of Joy in collaboration with Fondation Panzi and UNICEF. Located in Bukavu, the facilities provide 180 Congolese women per year with group therapy, self-defense training, sexuality education, ecology / horticulture education and cultural events. With the support of Eve Ensler and the publicity from the V-Day campaign, One Billion Rising, a global protest to end violence and promote justice and gender equality, was founded on February 14, 2012, the fifteenth V-Day. The name described a UN and WHO estimate for the number of women in the world who are likely to be raped or beaten at least once. The project urges women and men to dance and rise up in opposition to violence. It has reached over 200 countries in regions such as North Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, with actions in each area dependent on local circumstances, traditions, and religions. Criticism In the early 2000s, some right wing critics attacked V-Day for \\"hijacking the occasion of Valentine's Day\\". These conservative critics argued that feminists should not be admonishing people to consider rape, incest and violence on an occasion designed to celebrate love and romance. Individualist feminist Wendy McElroy stated that \\"V-Day embodies the same double standard and dishonesty that has characterized most feminist pronouncements for decades\\" and urged people to \\"take back Valentines Day\\". One critique came from Clara Eugenia Rojas in her 2005 publication \\"The ‘V-Day’ March in Mexico: Appropriation and Misuse of Local Women's Activism.\\" Following the murders of the women in Juarez, Mexico, V-Day became involved with this cause. Rojas, a local feminist activist, noted that immediately following the discovery of the bodies, there was little that she nor anyone else could do to draw attention to the injustice and need for change. After five years of local activists attempting to promote awareness about the violence, V-Day finally put a spotlight on the incident and made it a global issue. Rojas, although grateful for the global exposure to the incident, believes that V-Day came too late to make much difference and that they were involved for the wrong reasons, i.e., publicity. Rojas also critiques the movement for sidelining the local feminists who were originally attached to this incident and failing to include them in organization or implementation of the march.The ‘V-Day’March in Mexico: Appropriation and Misuse of Local Women’s Activism. \\"National Women’s Studies Association Journal\\" 17:217-227 Another critique comes from the LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender) community. In her article \\"Queerness, Disability, and The Vagina Monologues”, Kim Hall explained her dissatisfaction with the V-Day movement and more specifically The Vagina Monologues on an exclusionary basis. Hall believes that the play excludes issues of violence against intersex individuals and perpetuates heterosexism and ableism, or prejudice against people with disabilities. After this critique was published, many performances of The Vagina Monologues began advocating for the Intersex Society of North America by providing literature at the plays and urging the audience to donate.Hall, Kim Q. 2005. “Queerness, Disability, and The Vagina Monologues.” Hypatia 20:100-119.

In 1928, Castle Island was connected to the mainland by a narrow strip of land and is thus no longer an island. It has been the site of a fortification since 1634, and is currently a recreation site and the location of Fort Independence. History *1632: A battery was constructed at Fort Hill, the southernmost portion of the Boston peninsula as an advance line of defense in case of attack. *1634: Now an established community, Boston sought defenses farther out in the harbor, on one of the numerous islands which protected the port; shipping being the only means of receiving supplies and communications from England. Hull was the first site inspected but the cold sea breeze proved too much for Governor Winthrop and his counselors and this idea was abandoned. In July of this year twenty men, including Governor Thomas Dudley and his council, visited Castle Island and decided it would be perfect site for a fortress. Each man present subscribed 5 pounds for the fortification and elected Deputy Governor Roger Ludlow and Captain John Mason of Dorchester, to supervise construction. After two platforms and a small earthwork were constructed on the northeast side of the island, the General Court resolved that the fort at Castle Island be fully perfected, before any other fortification was begun. *1635: Three cannons, one of which belonged to Deputy Governor Bilingham, were carried down on lighters and installed at the Castle and the garrison, made up of two men weekly from each of the six towns to be paid from the treasury of the colony, fired these at incoming vessels until the ship recognized the fortification by raising her flag. Thomas Beecher (ancestor of Henry Ward Beecher) who had come over as master of the \\"Talbot\\" was one of the Castle officers at this time. Captain Nicholas Simpkins was the first commander (followed by Lt Edward Gibbons). Roger Clapp served for several decades as an officer at Castle Island. *1775: Prince Hall and fourteen other men of African descent became freemasons on March 6, 1775 on the island. They were initiated in a British Army Lodge, No. 441 of the Irish Registry by J. E. Batt, Worshipful Master, on what was then still called Castle William Island. First named Castle William by the English, who were fighting the French for control over North America. One of the more famous figures to be imprisoned at the Fort was privateer Pierre Maisonnat dit Baptiste (1702–06). The fort was renamed Fort Independence in 1797 and is one of the oldest fortified sites in British North America. In the late 18th- century it served as the first state prison in Massachusetts.State of Massachusetts, Acts and Resolves, 1784–1785 (Boston, 1886), 163. The present structure, built between 1833 and 1851, is the eighth generation of forts. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. During the Siege of Boston at the start of the American Revolution \\"Castle William\\" served as the main base of military operations for the British. The leaders of the Massachusetts royal administration took refuge there with their families, as did some prominent loyalists or \\"tories.\\" Major Pelham Winslow of the prominent loyalist town of Marshfield, Massachusetts was the Commander of Castle William for a time during the Revolution. After the March 17, 1776 British Evacuation of Boston, Castle William was destroyed a few days later (March 20, 1776).Robertson, Archibald. \\"His Diaries and Sketches in America\\" (New York: New York Public Library & Arno Press Inc, 1971 reprint edition).

The island is also the site of a monument to Donald McKay, the builder of the famous clipper ships Flying Cloud and Sovereign of the Seas. The monument faces across Boston Harbor towards East Boston, where McKay built his ships. Castle Island was originally some distance offshore, but land reclamation for expansion of port facilities has extended the mainland towards it, and it is now connected to the mainland by pedestrian and vehicle causeways. Today it is operated as a state park by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation and is open to tours in the summer. Castle Island during World War II. Local lore has it that an unpopular officer was walled up in the fort's dungeon following a duel in which he killed a more popular man. Edgar Allan Poe learned of the legend while serving on Castle Island in the Army, and his short story \\"The Cask of Amontillado\\" is said to be based on it. During World War II the U.S. Navy used the site for a ship degaussing station. As a visitor attraction Castle Island is open to the public year-round.

R. Hewitt, ‘Douglas, James, fourth earl of Morton (c.1516–1581)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004.) was a son of John Douglas, 2nd Earl of Morton and a grandson of James Douglas, 1st Earl of Morton and Joan of Scotland, a daughter of James I of Scotland. He married Catherine Stewart, an illegitimate daughter of King James IV of Scotland by his mistress Marion Boyd. The couple had three daughters; Margaret, Beatrix, and Elizabeth. He was succeeded by his son-in-law, James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton, husband of his daughter Elizabeth. His daughter Lady Margaret Douglas married James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Arran, who was heir presumptive to the Scottish throne after Mary, Queen of Scots prior to the birth of Queen Mary's son Prince James in 1566. Beatrix married Robert Maxwell, 6th Lord Maxwell. Morton's three daughters were all affected by mental ill-health.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (1898), 615. Resignation at Brechin In 1541, James V of Scotland ordered the Earl to travel to Inverness and enter ward (house-arrest). But the King met him on his way at Brechin on 17 October 1541. Morton resigned his titles to Dalkeith Palace and its lands to the King, and he was allowed to return home. The legal instrument was witnessed by David Beaton, Thomas Erskine of Haltoun, John Tennent, Oliver Sinclair of Pitcairns, Andrew Wood of Largo, and other prominent courtiers. The lands were immediately granted to Robert Douglas of Lochleven, the husband of the King's former mistress Margaret Erskine. Robert Douglas subsequently resigned the title to James V on 20 January 1542, withholding only Aberdour Castle. In 1543, after the death of James V, the Earl successfully challenged the legality of his resignation before the council of Regent Arran. Morton stated that he was old and infirm and would have been unlikely to survive confinement in Inverness away from the comfort of East Lothian, and was compelled by his 'just dredour' (rightful fear) of the King with his 'menacing' and messages with 'boastful words'. He had 'quietly' had a notary draw up his objections on 29 March 1542. Arran's council declared him a 'constant man' in the face of fear and dread and the transactions were to have no avail in all time to come.Registrum Honoris de Morton, vol. 2, Bannatyne Club (1853) 263–265, 272–273, 288–293. Morton was assisted in asserting his rights in 1543 by George Douglas of Pittendreich. The historian, Jamie Cameron, suggests that the motive of James V may have been to settle the Morton heritage on his son by Margaret Erskine, James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray, in the event the Earldom came to George Douglas's son.Cameron, Jamie, James V, Tuckwell (1998), 274–277.

Hammerberg (1920-1945), of Flint, Michigan, who was awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously for rescuing two fellow divers from a wreck in Pearl Harbor. Hammerberg was launched 20 August 1954 by Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine, sponsored by Mrs. Elizabeth Moss; and commissioned 2 March 1955, Lieutenant Commander Murray E. Draper in command. Based at Naval Station Newport Rhode Island, Hammerberg participated in convoy exercises, trained students at the Fleet Sonar School, Key West, and conducted antisubmarine warfare exercises during her first 2½ years of service. 1950's Hammerberg departed Newport 3 September 1957 to participate in maneuvers with units of NATO. Antisubmarine training in the Irish Sea was followed by visits to Plymouth, England and Brest, France, before the destroyer escort returned to Newport 21 October. Then, after hunter-killer exercises with the aircraft carrier , Hammerberg sailed from Newport 1 April 1958 to Bodø, Norway, to take part in combined exercises with the Royal Norwegian Navy. She returned to Boston 14 May. During August and September 1958, the Hammerberg was part of Navy Task Force 88 (TF-88), during Operation Argus, which was involved in conducting nuclear tests in the very high atmosphere. Departing Newport 27 January 1959, Hammerberg sailed to Guantanamo Bay for refresher training, then took part in antisubmarine warfare training with the navies of Chile and Peru. She returned to Newport 21 April. 1960s, including the Cuban Missile Crisis Between May 1959 and February 1960, Hammerberg was busy with antisubmarine exercises interspersed with cruises to Newfoundland and Puerto Rico. In March and April, she participated in Amphibious operations at Onslow Beach, N.C., and deployed 23 August 1960 for her second South American cruise. Hammerberg returned to Newport 13 December. Hammerberg departed Newport 7 August 1961 on her third South American cruise. In November, at the request of the Organization of American States (OAS), Hammerberg and other American ships patrolled offshore the Dominican Republic to help ensure the orderly change over of that government and check Communist influence. Hammerberg returned to Newport 1 December. During 1962, Hammerberg participated in convoy escort operations and operated with the Fleet Sonar School in Key West. On 7 November, Hammerberg was en route south to NS Mayport, Fla., where she was diverted to patrol the Florida Coast during the Cuban Missile Crisis. On 29 November, after President John F. Kennedy had resolved the Cuban Crisis, she sailed for Newport, R.I., for a well-deserved rest and tender availability. 1963 found Hammerberg in the Boston Naval Shipyard. From June to November, she devoted time to \\"Unites IV\\"--a deployment which was to comprise the circumnavigation of South America in the conduct Of ASW operations with seven South American navies. On 30 November, Hammerberg preceded to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for participation in \\"PHIBASWEX I-63\\", a large-scale amphibious, ASW operation with over 30 other units of the Atlantic Fleet. On 17 December, she arrived Newport, R.I. During 1964, Hammerberg participated in Operations \\"Springboard\\", \\"Canus Silex\\", and \\"Steel Pike\\", all exercises to sharpen the ship and crew not only in her important mission of locating and destroying submarines, but also in patrol, escort, rescue, evacuation, blockade and surveillance assignments. On 8 February 1965, Hammerberg got underway for Northern Europe to join NATO \\"Match Maker I\\" Squadron in Exercise \\"Pilot High\\". On 3 May, the squadron left Lisbon for Operation \\"Pole Star\\" off Halifax, Nova Scotia. After return to Newport 20 July, Hammerberg went into repair at Boston Naval Shipyard. She then trained off Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and in August 1966 rendezvoused with escort , guided missile frigate and submarine off Trinidad to participate in Operation \\"Unitas VII\\" through November. In late March while serving plane guard duty astern of USS Essex (CVS 9), Hammerberg attempted to rescue the crew of a downed SH3A Sikorsky Sea King helicopter.

Chambers In Search of the Unknown is a module for the Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game, designed for use with the Basic Set of rules. It was written by game designer Mike Carr and was first published in 1979 by TSR, Inc. The module details a hidden complex known as the Caverns of Quasqueton. Reviewers considered it a good quality introduction to the game that was written in the so-called dungeon crawl style, where the primary goal of the players is the exploration of a dangerous labyrinth to battle monsters and obtain treasure. Publication history The module was included with the first edition of the D&D; Basic Set. The module was written by Mike Carr, and printed as a thirty-two page booklet with an outer folder and a two-color cover; the original version also included a section on page six for \\"Using this Module with AD&D;\\". The AD&D; section was deleted in the 1981 printing. The adventure ran through six different printings in addition to a pre-production version that appeared in promotional artwork. The first printing was in 1978, although an incorrect copyright lists it as 1979. In Search of the Unknown was an introductory scenario intended to teach Dungeon Masters (DMs) how to create dungeons. Mike Carr intended it for use as an instructional adventure for new players. The module is a beginner's scenario, which allows the DM to add monsters and treasure. (preview) The module is coded B1 because it was created as the first adventure for the Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set, though it is possible to convert it to Advanced Dungons & Dragons. The adventure is designed for characters of first to third level, and was written for DMs and players with little or no gaming experience. Interior art was by David C. Sutherland III, while Sutherland and David A. Trampier did the cover of the original monochrome edition.Carr, Mike. In Search of the Unknown (TSR, 1979) The updated 1981 edition featured front and back cover art by Darlene Pekul. A lengthy introduction explains the workings of the adventure and provides many tips for novice DMs and players. There is a character roster which contains forty-eight first level pre- generated player characters. The module also contains a section showing the availability of henchmen and hirelings for use as non-player characters to travel with the party, and details of these characters for the DM. The module includes a number of rooms and caves meant for the DM to fill in with monsters and treasure, selected from tables provided in the module. The 10th Anniversary Dungeons & Dragons Collector's Set boxed set, published by TSR in 1984, included the rulebooks from the Basic, Expert, and Companion sets; modules AC2 Combat Shield and Mini-adventure, AC3 The Kidnapping of Princess Arelina, In Search of the Unknown, B2 The Keep on the Borderlands, and M1 Blizzard Pass; Player Character Record Sheets; and dice. The set was limited to a thousand copies, and was sold by mail and at GenCon 17. None of the text or background from In Search of the Unknown was included in the compilation module In Search of Adventure, despite its inclusion in the title. Its map was included in the back of the book as an extra dungeon that the dungeon master may wish to populate and use. Although B1 is presented as setting neutral, the first printing suggested locations for placing the module in the World of Greyhawk campaign setting (namely, Ratik, Tenh, and the Pale). This information was removed in subsequent printings. Plot summary Many years ago two wealthy adventurers, Rogahn the Fearless and Zelligar the Unknown, built a hidden complex known as the Caverns of Quasqueton. From this base, they conducted their affairs away from the prying eyes of civilization. While of questionable ethical standing, the two drove back a barbarian invasion and gained the support of locals. Eventually, they gathered their own army and went on an expedition against said enemies, where they met their demise. The player characters (PCs) enter the story at this point, hearing a variety of rumors provided in the module. Each PC knows one or more of the stories although the veracity of them is somewhat questionable. The rumors mostly involve a great treasure hidden somewhere in the Caverns of Quasqueton, which the PCs can enter from a cave-like opening. A variety of monsters wander through the finished upper level of the dungeon including orcs, troglodytes, and giant rats. The DM checks periodically to see if the group encounters these menaces in addition to the dangers in each individual room. Most of the rooms come with blank spots where the DM fills in whatever monster or treasure is most suitable for their campaign. The finished upper level served as a home for Rogahn and Zelligar and contains much of their personal possessions. A number of traps await an unwary group. Some of these rooms include an area filled with pools (some hazardous and others not) and a wizard's laboratory. The randomly generated monsters in the lower, unfinished level differ from those above and include zombies and goblins. Some of the pre-filled rooms on this level include a museum, an arena, and grand cavern, but many of the caves on this level include no description at all and the DM must devise contents for these areas. The end of the module includes a list of foes and treasure for the group to fight and find. It also includes a list of characters of various classes the group might encounter while exploring the dungeon. Also included are a number of pre-generated characters the group might use to play through the adventure. Reception With its simple, straightforward plot and design, In Search of the Unknown was regarded as a good introduction to running the D&D; game. Don Turnbull reviewed In Search of the Unknown in issue No. 13 of the magazine White Dwarf (June/July 1979), and gave the module a rating of 9 out of 10. He compared this module to Against the Giants and Descent into the Depths of the Earth, complimenting In Search of the Unknown's \\"excellent format, for instance, and the comprehensive way in which the scenario is introduced. TSR's high quality has not been in any way compromised\\". Turnbull criticized the module's use of Roman numerals as references, stating that ordinary numerals do the job much better. The module was reviewed in Shadis magazine in 1996. Ken Denmead of Wired listed the module as one of the \\"Top 10 D&D; Modules I Found in Storage This Weekend\\". According to Denmead, the module is \\"a classic dungeon crawl for beginning characters.\\" John Sprunk of Black Gate commented on his recollections of the adventure, as part of the basic D&D; box set: \\"I was hooked from the start, controlling this awesome new game that stretched our imaginations. Even though it’s been more than thirty years, I still remember the cool tricks and traps. Especially the chamber of pools, the teleportation rooms, and the young red dragon I placed in one of the dungeon storerooms just for fun.\\"https://www.blackgate.com/2014/10/02/the-dungeons-and-dragons-of-my-life- part-one/ ReferencesExternal links *The Acaeum entry *RPG.net review *ENworld reviews Category:Dungeons & Dragons modules Category:Greyhawk modules Category:Mystara ","title":"In Search of the Unknown"},{"id":"1616700","text":"The Oleta River State Park is a Florida State Park on Biscayne Bay in the municipal suburb of North Miami in metropolitan Miami, Florida.

Facilities The central feature of this park is the mouth of the Oleta River, for which it is named. The river has drawn human inhabitants to the area since about 500 B.C, when its shores served as a campground for Tequesta Indians. It was used by U.S. troops (who called it Big Snake Creek) in 1841 during the Second Seminole War, and further explored in 1881 by Naval Captain William Hawkins Fulford, whose ventured inland to what is now the city of North Miami Beach. The area became more heavily settled in the 1890s and in 1922, developers changed the name from Big Snake Creek to the Oleta River. The river itself no longer flows to the Everglades, but remains a popular area for canoeing. The park also boasts some of the best wilderness bike trails in the country, and is a frequent host for triathlons and other extreme sports events.

It is based on a sign language or another system of manual communication. \\"Tactile signing\\" refers to the mode or medium, i.e. signing (using some form of signed language or code), using touch. It does not indicate whether the signer is using a tactile form of a natural language (e.g. American Sign Language), a modified form of such a visual sign language, a modified form of a manually coded language, or something else.  Kinds  Until the 1970s, most people who were deaf and blind lived lives of isolation. As professionals became aware of this population, attempts were made to serve deafblind people by creating manual alphabets or modifying sign languages used by deaf-sighted people. See for example Helen Keller National Center, LightHouse for the Blind and Visually Impaired and Alabama Institute for the Deaf and Blind. Several methods of deafblind communication have been developed, including: * Hand-over-hand (also known as 'hands-on signing'): The receiver’s hand(s) are placed lightly upon the back of the hands of the signer to read the signs through touch and movement. The sign language used in hand- over-hand signing is often a slightly modified version of the local sign language; this is especially the case when used by people who have learned to read sign visually before losing their vision as with Usher syndrome. The sign language used may also be a manually coded version of the local oral language (such as Signed English), or a mid-way point between the two known as contact signing. * Tracking: The listener lightly places their hand(s) on the wrists or forearms of the signer to help them track the signs visually (as the listener knows the location of their own hands and is thus able to focus on the signer's hand(s) as they move in space. The listener using 'tracking' typically has a limited field of vision. * Tactile fingerspelling: A manual form of the alphabet in which words are spelled out (see manual alphabet) may be the best known as it was the method Anne Sullivan used to communicate with Helen Keller. Different manual alphabets may be used, such as the one-handed ASL alphabet or the two-handed manual alphabets used, for example, in Britain. Again, the listener places a hand over that of the signer. This alphabet is also rarely used in the United States. * Lorm: A hand-touch alphabet developed in the 19th century by deafblind inventor and novelist Hieronymus Lorm and used in several European countries. * Tracing or 'print-on-palm': Tracing letters (or shapes) onto the palm or body of receiver. Capital letters produced in consistent ways are referred to as the 'block alphabet' or the 'spartan alphabet'. * Braille signing: Using six spots on the palm to represent the six dots of a braille cell. Alternatively, the signer may 'type' onto a table as if using a braille typewriter (see Perkins Brailler) and the receiver will place their hands on top. This method can have multiple receivers on top of each other, however a receiver sitting opposite will be reading the braille cell backwards. Additionally, simple ways of responding, such as a tap for 'yes' or a rubbing motion for 'no', may be included. In Japan, a system developed by a deafblind woman is in use to represent the five vowels and five major consonants of the Japanese language on the fingers, where the signer 'types' onto a table and the receiver places their hands on top to 'listen' (see this page for more info). What was especially challenging was communicating with children or babies born deaf and blind who had not had an opportunity to learn a natural (spoken or signed) language. Below are listed some of these attempts. * Co-active signing: The sender moves and manipulates the hands and arms of the Deafblind person to form sign shapes, or fingerspelt words. This is often used with deafblind children to teach them signs, and with people with an intellectual disability. * On-body signing: The body of the person who is deafblind is used to complete the sign formation with another person. E.g.: chin, palm, chest. Often used with people who also have an intellectual disability.  Communities develop  As the decades progressed, deafblind people began to form communities where tactile language were born. Just as deaf people brought together in communities first used invented forms of spoken language and then created their own natural languages which suited the lives of deaf-sighted people (i.e. visual languages), so too, deafblind people in communities first used modified forms of visual language and are now creating their own natural tactile languages. For the development of visual sign languages, see for example: Deaf Education; List of sign languages; Nicaraguan Sign Language. One of the most active communities is in the Seattle area of Washington State. See Washington State DeafBlind Citizens . Comparison to visual sign language Little data exists on the specifics of variation between visual and tactile sign language use. However, studies suggest a significant degree of difference. In hand-over-hand signing, elements of deaf sign languages known as 'non-manual features' (such as facial expression) will not be received, and will need to be substituted with supplementary information produced manually. Common non-manual features used in Deaf Sign languages that are absent in tactile signing include raised eyebrows as a question marker and a shaking head as a negation. Tactile signing also resides within a smaller space than is typical in visual sign language. Signs that touch the body may be moved forward into a more neutral space. Other signs which are usually produced in an 'out of range' location (such as the leg) may be modified (either spelled or a variant sign used). Different rules govern turn-taking, greetings and goodbyes. An example of a language that naturally developed among the deaf-blind is Bay Islands Sign Language in Honduras. History In 1648 in England, John Bulwer wrote of a couple who were proficient in tactile sign communication: > \\"A pregnant example of the officious nature of the Touch in supplying the > defect or temporall incapacity of the other senses we have in one Master > Babington of Burntwood in the County of Essex, an ingenious gentleman, who > through some sicknesse becoming deaf, doth notwithstanding feele words, and > as if he had an eye in his finger, sees signes in the darke; whose Wife > discourseth very perfectly with him by a strange way of Arthrologie or > Alphabet contrived on the joynts of his Fingers; who taking him by the hand > in the night, can so discourse with him very exactly; for he feeling the > joynts which she toucheth for letters, by them collected into words, very > readily conceives what shee would suggest unto him.

The program was created in 1995 in order to support the Stockpile Stewardship Program (or SSP). The goal of the initiative is to extend the lifetime of the current aging stockpile.  History  After the United States' 1992 moratorium on live nuclear testing, the Stockpile Stewardship Program was created in order to find a way to test, and maintain the nuclear stockpile. In response, the National Nuclear Security Administration began to simulate the nuclear warheads using supercomputers. As the stockpile ages, the simulations have become more complex, and the maintenance of the stockpile requires more computing power. Over the years, due to Moore's Law, the ASC program has created several different supercomputers with increasing power, in order to compute the simulations and mathematics.  Research  The majority of ASC's research is done on super-computers in three different laboratories. The calculations are verified by human calculations. = Laboratories = The ASC program has three laboratories: * Sandia National Laboratories * Los Alamos National Laboratory * Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory = Computing = Current supercomputers  The ASC program currently houses two supercomputers on the TOP500 list for computing power. The Sequoia, which as of 2016 was ranked third in the world for computing power, is currently being used for simulation and testing in the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Cielo, which is also located in Los Alamos National Laboratory, is 57th on the TOP500 list for most powerful computer as of 2016. Cielo is researching classified information. Although these computers may be in separate laboratories, remote computing has been established between the three main laboratories.

They are responsible for making sure the tri-lab network, computing storage space, power usage, and the customer computing resources are all in line. = Computational Systems and Software Environment = The Computational and User Support subdivision is responsible for maintaining and creating the supercomputer software according to NNSA's standards. They also deal with the data, networking and software tools. The ASCI Path Forward project substantially funded the initial development of the Lustre parallel file system from 2001 to 2004. = Verification and Validation = The Verification and Validation subdivision is responsible for mathematically verifying the simulations and outcomes. They also help software engineers write more precise codes in order to decrease the margin of error when the computations are run. = Physics and Engineering Models = The Physics and Engineering Models subdivision is responsible for deciphering the mathematical and physical analysis of nuclear weapons. They integrate physics models into the codes in order to gain a more accurate simulation. They deal with the way that the nuclear weapon will act under certain conditions based on physics. They also study nuclear properties, vibrations, high explosives, advanced hydrodynamics, material strength and damage, thermal and fluid response, and radiation and electrical responses. = Integrated Codes = The Integrated Codes subdivision is responsible for the mathematical codes that are produced by the supercomputers. They use these mathematical codes, and present them in a way that is understandable to humans. These codes are then used by the National Nuclear Society Administration, the Stockpile Steward Program, Life Extension Program, and Significant Finding Investigation, in order to decide the next steps that need to be taken in order to secure and lengthen the life of the nuclear stockpile. = Advanced Technology Development and Mitigation = The Advanced Technology Development and Mitigation subdivision is responsible for researching developments in high performance computing. Once information is found on the next generation of high performance computing, they decide what software and hardware needs to be adapted in order to prepare for the next generation of computers.

The organization is not a political party in the classical sense: its members belong to, and in some cases lead, a variety of political parties. It is more of a loose coalition, although whether it intends to organize electorally is unclear. The coalition adheres to seven principles and pursues five objectives. History The coalition takes its name from the town of its headquarters, Qornet Shehwan, a town in the Matn District of the Mount Lebanon Governorate, and the seat of the Maronite Archbishopric of the district. It was founded on 30 April 2001 by total of 29 individuals, representing political parties and civic organizations, as well as independents, with the blessing of the Maronite Patriarch Nasrallah Boutros SfeirThe Daily Star, Beirut, 1 May 2001. and under the leadership of the region's bishop Youssef Bechara. Membership (see below) has fluctuated since, as some founding members and parties are no longer affiliated. Even Patriarch Sfeir retreated from his earlier endorsement of the group (under government pressure, some allege) to a less partisan stance. Some who have left continue to work with the coalition informally, however. As a prelude to a full withdrawal of Syrian troops, the Qornet Shehwan originally called for their redeployment to the Bekaa Valley and described Israel as the main danger to Lebanon. In the wake of the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri on 14 February 2005, however, the Qornet Shehwan escalated its campaign to call for the immediate withdrawal of Syrian military and intelligence forces from Lebanon, and for fresh parliamentary and presidential elections to be held, free from foreign interference. Qornet Shehwan member (and now parliamentarian) Samir Frangieh said on 16 March 2005 that parliamentary elections must precede presidential ones, because the current parliament (elected in 2000 and allegedly gerrymandered to produce a pro-Syrian majority), would be likely to elect another pro-Syrian President to succeed Émile Lahoud, whom the opposition considers to be a Syrian puppet. The 2005 parliamentary elections results were disastrous for the Qornet Shehwan Gathering, because most of their candidates lost to Free Patriotic Movement of general Michel Aoun, whose candidates grabbed 21 seats in the Christian heartland. Only 14 members of the gathering (Nayla Moawad, Jawad Boulos Solange Gemayel, Gebran Tueni, Samir Frangieh, Boutros Harb, two of the Kataeb candidates and six of the Lebanese Forces candidates) managed to get to the parliament. Principles The Qornet Shehwan Gathering adheres to the following seven principles: # Lebanon is not an artificial state, but a homeland for all Lebanese people. As such, it is entitled to its independence, and can solve its problems only as an independent nation. # Differences between Lebanon's political groups and religious sects must be solved by mutual respect and dialogue, not by confrontation. # The Taif Agreement and the related subsequent constitutional amendments must be implemented as written, not manipulated by \\"external forces to achieve internal gains.\\" (At this point, the Qornet Shehwan differs from some of the more extreme opposition groups, which reject the Taif Agreement). # A modern constitutional structure, based on democracy and committed to the rule of law, guaranteeing equality for all citizens, must be built. The judiciary should be independent of political interference. # Israel is seen as \\"the major source of danger to the people and the land.\\" The resistance to the Israeli occupation of Southern Lebanon (1982–2000) is applauded. (In this matter, the Qornet Shehwan does not antagonize the foreign policy status quo, thereby avoiding a divisive political issue). # The Syrian occupation of Lebanon must end, and Lebanon and Syria must reconstitute their relationship as equal parties. Sound relations and \\"brotherly ties\\" can be achieved only if neither party is controlled by the other. # Lebanon is an integral part of the Arab world, and wants to play a full part in it as a sovereign state. Objectives The Qornet Shehwan Gathering pursues the following five objectives: # The withdrawal of all Syrian forces from Lebanon and the recovery of full sovereignty. # Formulation of a new electoral law to eliminate gerrymandering, establishment of judicial independence, and limitation of the right of security forces to intervene. # Comprehensive national reconciliation, the return of exiles, and the release of political prisoners. # Support for the establishment of a Palestinian state, with its capital in Jerusalem. Palestinian refugees in Lebanon to be moved to the Palestinian state, with Israel and the international community charged with responsibility for their resettlement. # An Arab-wide \\"just and comprehensive\\" peace settlement with Israel to \\"safeguard Arab rights.\\" No peace settlement is to be made by Lebanon unilaterally.

Referred to as the \\"Jeans Genius\\" by Suzy Menkes, he is the president of OTB Group, the parent company of Diesel, Maison Margiela, Marni, Amiri, Viktor & Rolf, Staff International (manufacturer and distributor of DSquared² and Maison Margiela, Marni, and Brave Kid (manufacturer and distributor of Diesel Kid, Dsquared², Marni, and N21). Founder of the Only the Brave Foundation, a nonprofit organization, Rosso is also the president of Red Circle and Red Circle investments; the Diesel Farm in Marostica, Veneto; the Pelican Hotel in Miami; and L.R. Vicenza Virtus. In 2020, Forbes listed him as the 19th richest man in Italy (with estimated assets worth $4.2 billion) Early life Rosso was born in the village of Brugine in the northeastern Italian region of Veneto. His parents were farmers. In 1970 began studying industrial Textile Manufacturing at the Marconi Technical Institute in Padua. There, he produced, at the age of 15, his first self-designed garment, a pair of low-waist bell- bottomed jeans using his mother's Singer sewing machine. He kept experimenting with different jeans models and would give each pair to friends or sell them at school for about 3500 lire.Tungate, Mark: \\"Fifty\\". Gestalten Verlag; 2005. In 1973 he began studying Economics at the University of Venice and in addition to helping his father on the farm, he financed his studies also by working as a mechanic and as a carpenter. DieselBeginnings of Diesel= Diesel logo Rosso dropped out of the University of Venice in 1975 and began to work as Production Manager at Moltex, a local clothing manufacturer that produced trousers for various Italian clothing labels. Moltex' parent company, the Genius Group, was run by Adriano Goldschmied who would eventually become Rosso's mentor and future business partner. In 2007, after Rosso had managed to increase the company's production beyond what Goldschmied actually considered possible, Rosso wanted to leave the company to start a new business on his own. However, Goldschmied convinced Rosso to stay by offering him a 40% stake in Moltex and by agreeing to form a new company together, thus forming Diesel.Rosso, Renzo: \\"Be Stupid: For Successful Living\\". Rizzoli, 2011. Following the new partnership, Rosso also became shareholder of the Genius Group, which gathered brands such as Replay, King Jeans, Viavai and Goldie which Katharine Hamnett designed a collection for. The brand name Diesel was chosen because 'diesel' was considered to be the 'alternative fuel' in the oil crisis, and Rosso and Goldschmied liked the idea of their brand being perceived as an alternative jeans brand in contrast to the prevalent casual wear brands. Furthermore, since the word was an international term pronounced equally all over the world, it appealed to Rosso's view that the global fashion market was not segmented by national borders, but by people's lifestyle. In 2004, after having followed those core values for nearly 20 years, CNN accredited Diesel for being \\"the first brand to believe truly in the global village and to embrace it with open arms.\\" In an article by The NY Times in August 2013, it was estimated that Diesel had sold more than 100,000,000 jeans since 1978. =Diesel acquisition= In 1985 Rosso wanted to achieve creative freedom over the brand's direction and took complete control of the company, by trading his shares in the Genius Group, at the time Diesel's parent company, for Goldschmied's remaining shares in Diesel. Following the launch of Diesel Kid the year prior, at the time called Dieselito, sales of the Diesel-branded clothing had by that point reached about $5 million annually. Wanting to focus on denim, Rosso began experimenting with different ways of treating the fabric with stones and washes. Then, after handpicking team of likeminded designers in the late 1980s, the company began a period of remarkable growth and expansion. =Diesel in the 1990s= During the first part of the 1990s Rosso pioneered Diesel into the fashion world and set the grounds for its establishment in global markets. In 1991 the company launched its first international marketing effort with the highly successful 'Guides for Successful Living' campaign series. In 1992 the campaign won a Grand Prix at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival, the world's leading awards in advertising. Diesel Farm In late 1992 Rosso purchased a farm close to the Diesel headquarters in Molvena, in the Italian region of Veneto, where he began producing wine and olive oil under the name Diesel Farm. Initially the purchase was meant as a sign to his father, who until then was puzzled by his choice of career, but who then, for the first time, understood that his son had in fact become a successful business entrepreneur.Pop Magazine, 2003 At the time of the purchase the farm and its land was at risk of getting divided into separate lots for multiple buyers, but Rosso was able to prevent this by taking charge of the whole estate. Today the land and the old farm buildings are considered a nature reserve. The Pelican Hotel In 1994, Rosso reopened the Pelican Hotel on Miami's South Beach strip. The hotel, which was a historical Art Deco building constructed in 1939, had been restored under the direction of his Creative Team after Rosso had fallen in love with the building in 1991 and purchased it one month later. Its kitsch, retro-styled interior with each room being independently designed and different from the others, was considered unique for its time and contributed to Diesel's image of the 'Successful Living' lifestyle. Several years later the hotel was listed by British daily newspaper The Independent as one of the world's \\"best fashion hotels\\". Other brands included in the list were hotels by Missoni, Armani, Bulgari and Ralph Lauren, which had all been opened after the Pelican. Diesel in the late 1990s In the second half of the 1990s, Diesel continued to ignore common marketing rules and began to establish itself as a major brand in the global fashion market. This was a result of Rosso's ambition to always break new grounds and his aspiration to work with most creative agencies and photographers around, including David LaChapelle, Terry Richardson, Ellen von Unwerth, Rankin,Roberts, Kevin and Diesel: \\"Diesel XXX Years of Diesel Communication\\". Rizzoli, 2008. and Erwin Olaf. In 1995, Diesel became the first major fashion brand to embrace the Internet with the launch of www.diesel.com, which two years later was followed by the first online store of any fashion brand. Later in 1995 the company also launched one of its most popular yet provocative campaigns ever, featuring two kissing sailors staged at the peace celebration of World War II. Shot by photographer David LaChapelle, it was the first major public advertisement to show a homosexual couple kissing and was published at height of the \\"Don't ask, Don't tell\\" debates in the US, which had led the U.S. Government to refuse entry to military service for openly gay, lesbian, or bisexual persons. In the late 1990s, Diesel began opening a large number of stores around the world, starting with its first ever mono-brand store, located on Lexington Avenue in New York in 1996, which was followed by stores in Milan, London and Rome. In contrast to common retail norms of the time, Rosso decided that each Diesel store should be styled independently. Occasionally, he would also collaborate with famous artists in this progress, as in 2003 when he let the artist Stephen Sprouse personalize the Union Square Diesel store in New York with graffiti. Rosso also opened up new locations to showcase creativity, such as the Diesel Denim Gallery in New York and Osaka, Japan. The galleries showcased hand-treated denim of the highest quality and gave exhibition space to young, local artists. The Diesel Denim Galleries were much acclaimed by the fashion press and were described by The New York Times' Suzy Menkes simply as \\"super- cool\\". =Diesel in the 2000s= Throughout the 2000s, Rosso increased Diesel's share in the global fashion market, mainly through opening more company owned stores, embarking on a series of brand collaborations, and by expanding on the business of Diesel. Collaborations In 2002, Rosso was asked to collaborate with Karl Lagerfeld on a denim collection for the designer's Lagerfeld Gallery. The collection, which was called Lagerfeld Gallery by Diesel, was co-designed by Lagerfeld and then developed by Diesel's Creative Team. It consisted of five pieces that were presented during the designer's catwalk shows during Paris Fashion Week and then sold in very limited editions at the Lagerfeld Galleries Stores in Paris and Monaco, and at the Diesel Denim Galleries in New York City and Tokyo. During the first week of sales in New York, more than 90% of the trousers were sold out, even though prices ranged from as high as $240 to $1840. In a statement after the show in Paris, Rosso said \\"I am honored to have met this fashion icon of our time. Karl represents creativity, tradition and challenge, and the fact that he thought of Diesel for this collaboration is a great gift and acknowledgement of our reputation as the prêt-à-porter of casual wear.\\" In 2003, Rosso asked legendary street and graffiti artist Stephen Sprouse to take over Diesel's Union Square store for New York Fashion Week the following September. As part of the collaboration Sprouse designed a series of limited edition jeans, T-shirts and hats, and made a complete makeover of the Diesel store, which meant adding his renowned Day-Glo design to windows, interiors, and outer building exteriors. Business partnerships In 2007, Rosso and Diesel partnered with L'Oréal for the production of Diesel's first fragrance, labelled Fuel For Life. This was followed by a partnership with Italian carmaker FIAT in early 2008 to re-design the classic Fiat 500. Originally one of FIAT's most popular models ever, the new version, simply titled '500 by Diesel', featured several unique design details in the car's interior and exterior and was only produced in 10,000 units. In the spring of 2008, Rosso launched a collaboration between Diesel and sportswear giant Adidas. After Diesel made a special denim collection for Adidas that was exclusively available at Adidas Originals stores, called Adidas Originals by Diesel, the collaboration then developed into Adidas making special sneakers called Forum Mid Diesel Lea, Forum Mid Diesel Txt, ZX 700 Diesel, Stan Smith Special, Stan Smith 80's Diesel - available in Diesel stores worldwide. In May 2011, Rosso launched the first ever Diesel bicycle, together with award-winning bicycle manufacturer Pinarello. Built as a single-speed, city bicycle with a hydro formed aluminum frame, the collaboration marked one of the first true collaborations between the bicycle and the fashion industry. Diesel Black Gold In February 2008, Rosso launched a new, premium line extension called Diesel Black Gold. The new line combined Diesel's original expertise in denim and casual wear with the craftsmanship of tailoring. Through its collections of artfully distressed denim and leather, new twists on traditional garments and iconic blends of past and future, Diesel Black Gold has become the largest non-designer label in the contemporary high-end fashion market, and has successfully managed to become a casual alternative to other luxury brands. Successful Living from Diesel In 2009, Rosso launched Diesel's first home collection, called Successful Living from Diesel. Produced together with pioneering Italian manufacturers Moroso, Foscarini and Zucchi, For Successful Living from Diesel was credited by Wallpaper magazine for its style and comfort when it premiered at Salone del Mobile in April 2009. Advertising campaigns and Marketing In the early 2000s Rosso and Diesel began to implement a mindset into their global marketing strategy that \\"put sales and profit second to building something special for customers, often by creating interactive user experiences that are not directly connected to retail, sales or stores.\\" In a research study of innovative businesses presented by The Times, much of Diesel's successful growth in the early 2000s was accredited to this mindset. The study concluded that \\"Diesel is an experience which interacts with and entertains its customers with a far deeper relationship than other brands\\", and that \\"It is always about engaging with the customer as opposed to selling at them: creating an enjoyable two-way dialogue as opposed to a hollow one-way monologue.\\" In 2007 this approach took another step, leading to the infamous 'Heidies'. which mocked the phenomenon of reality TV and was one of the first ever campaigns by a fashion brand solely based on the Internet. It featured two models that were locked inside a room and who did whatever the online viewers suggested. The models played two mentally crazy women who, wanting to claim their 15 minutes of fame, had taken an intimate Diesel sales guy as hostage, closed themselves up in a hotel room and hijacked the company's website; requesting that they be selected for the next Diesel advertising campaign. The employee was said to work for Diesel Intimate, as the campaign was in fact the launch for the brand's new line of intimate and beachwear. The campaign became a huge success, and reached over 100,000 views daily while it was live. It was awarded at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival that same year. On October 11, 2008, Rosso and Diesel celebrated the company's 30th anniversary hosting 17 parties around the world all broadcast live online spanning across 24 hours. Following the opening in Tokyo, the live stream continued to Beijing, Dubai, Athens, Helsinki, Amsterdam, Milan, Zurich, Munich, Paris, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Barcelona, Oslo, London, São Paulo and finally ended in New York City, with Rosso's attendance. The event featured live performances by Daft Punk, Earth Wind and Fire, 2manydjs, Mark Ronson, New Young Pony Club, and a pregnant MIA who broke her retirement for the occasion. In addition there were neverseen before mash- ups with Chaka Khan feat. Franz Ferdinand and N.E.R.D. feat. Hot Chip. The event was advertised through the release of a video titled 'Diesel SFW XXX Party Video', which immediately went viral and spread rapidly across the Internet, mostly due to its ironic take on 1980s style pornography. By 2011 it had been viewed more than 20 million times online and classified as one of the most successful viral campaigns ever. Additionally, the anniversary event also featured the production of a limited edition pair of jeans, called 'The Dirty Thirty'. The denim, which were for sale for one day only (on the date of the birth of the brand) at the extremely discounted price of €30 and modeled by Daisy Lowe, caused 'hysteria' and lead consumers to form mile-long lines outside Diesel stores around the world. These jeans were sold out within just a few hours worldwide. Throughout the 2000s Rosso and the Diesel Creative Team also continued working with a number of famous photographers and agencies, including Jean Pierre Khazem, Carl de Keyzer, Finlay McKay, Elaine Constantine, Mert Alas & Marcus Piggott, Johan Renck, and Terry Richardson, the latter for the celebrated \\"Global Warming Ready\\" campaign of 2007. In 2001, 2007, 2009, and 2010 Diesel was given Grand Prix awards at Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival. Talent support In the early 2000s, Rosso pushed Diesel to start reinvesting part of the company's marketing budgets into the creative community, by financially supporting young, creative talent. This led to Diesel initiating projects like Diesel:U:Music Radio, Diesel New Art and Diesel Wall and become a founding partner of ITS (International Talent Support).[62] Furthermore, the company also helped launch Pocko’s affordable art books in 1999, and for a number of years sponsored projects like Online Flash Film Fest and Semi-Permanent. In 2001, Diesel:U:Music Radio was founded with a vision to support unsigned bands and as a reaction to an overly commercialized music industry. Consisting of an independent jury with artists and producers such as Ian McCulloch, Mark Ronson, and Ronnie Wood, the jury annually reviewed thousands of demos from around the world and selected winning, unsigned bands. By partnering with record labels like Warner Music or media publishers like Vice, the winning artists were offered records deals and media publicity. In 2006, the project was broadcast live on Channel 4 in Great Britain and featured legendary avant- garde rock band Roxy Music. In 2009, the project included a global tour and radio station. The tour featured live performances by artists like Kanye West and The Roots, who supported the competition's winning younger bands, The Terror Pigeon Dance Revolt! and HEARTSREVOLUTION. Produced in London, the Diesel:U:Music radio station was hailed by The Guardian and The Daily Telegraph for its unique quality programming, and had shows hosted by everyone from Grandmaster Flash to Franz Ferdinand. In an interview with Dazed & Confused, Rosso explained the purpose of the project, stating that \\"It's about giving people the tools and seeing them succeed and excel in their creativity\\". Through its 10-year history, the Diesel:U:Music winners included Diplo, Mylo, DJ Yoda and The Cool Kids. In 2002 Rosso and Diesel became founding partners of ITS (International Talent Support), a competition for young designers. While Rosso has often been a member of the jury, Diesel and the OTB, its parent company, sponsored the competition financially. In 2005, the founder of i-D Magazine, Terry Jones, credited ITS for \\"dedicating so much passion and commitment to the selection of designers, like no other organization.\\" In 2003 and 2004, Diesel began supporting local, young artists through the Diesel New Art and Diesel Wall competitions. Diesel New Art was open to graduating artists working across various media, and would award winning artists with solo exhibitions, shows at international art fairs, or promotion through internationally published catalogues. For Diesel Wall Diesel purchased large, unused facades in major cities and transformed them into popular exhibition spaces. Winning artworks were selected by an independent jury, and displayed on the walls for a longer period of time throughout the year. During the years a few of the jury members have included curator Hans Ulrich Obrist, film director Bigas Luna, art director and graphic designer Peter Saville, artist Patrick Tuttofuoco, art director Jérôme Sans and editors Helena Kontova and Stefano Boeri. Founded in 1989, ANDAM (National Association for the Development of the Fashion Arts) seeks, in the words of Pierre Bergé, \\"to identify emerging talents in contemporary fashion design and offer them the means to exist, to produce a runway show during Paris Fashion Week, and to establish and develop their label in France, thus perpetuating the dynamism of the Parisian fashion scene.\\" Thanks to its sponsors (Fondation Pierre Bergé, Galeries Lafayette, Google, Hermés, Kering, Lacoste, Longchamp, LMVH, OBO, OTB, Premiere Classe, Saint Laurent, Swarowski, Tomorrow) {{cite weburl=https://andam.fr/en/sponsors/), as well as of two public institutions, the DEFI and the French Ministry of Culture and Communication, ANDAM is the largest international fashion prize, a driving force in the development of new fashion designers in France. Renzo Rosso, was the mentor of the 2013 and 2019 ANDAM finalists. In addition to the financial endowment of the prize, the winners benefited from the strategic, creative and commercial coaching of a worldwide fashion industry entrepreneur, helping the winners develop their label and build an international reputation. Nicola Formichetti In the spring of 2013, Rosso named Nicola Formichetti, the former stylist of Lady Gaga and creative director of Mugler, as Diesel's Artistic Director. The announcement followed days of speculation and was met with positive response across the fashion world and daily news press. In an interview with V Magazine following the announcement, Rosso said \\"I finally met somebody as crazy as I am\\", and explained that Formichetti's new responsibilities will be overseeing \\"the total view\\" of Diesel's brand, including product, communications, marketing and interior design. Formichetti's first project's included launching a groundbreaking crowd-funded advertising campaign with Tumblr. The campaign, titled #Reboot and shot by Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin, featured prominent, young creatives ranging from graffiti artists to film students instead of common models, with varying body shapes, sizes and personal styles. OTB OTB Group's logo In the early 2000s, Rosso began investing in other fashion designers and companies that he admired for their creativity, but which often lacked financial stability; he independently emerged as a major player in the world of fashion. In 2000, Rosso made his first acquisition when he purchased Staff International and in 2008, he created the holding group OTB Group (Only the Brave). In May 2020, the group consists of Diesel, Maison Margiela, Marni, Amiri, Viktor & Rolf, Staff International and Brave Kid, the two latter being the manufacturers and distributors for a number of other fashion labels. The group counts today around 7,000 employees worldwide. =Staff International= In October 2000, Rosso purchased Staff International, an Italian fashion manufacturing and distributing company that licensed brands such as Vivienne Westwood and Maison Margiela. Staff International has gained a strong reputation in the prêt-a- porter arena, enabling it over the years to work for designers and brands such as Karl Lagerfeld, Emanuel Ungaro, Valentino, Costume National, Clements Ribeiro and Missoni, among others. Following the purchase, Rosso brought onboard licenses for DSquared2 in 2001 and Just Cavalli in 2011. =Maison Margiela= In 2002 Rosso purchased the majority of the stakes in the Maison Margiela fashion house. Like Rosso, founding designer Martin Margiela always had a profound admiration for vintage and authenticity. In the 1990s Margiela became famous for his concept of deconstruction, where he made re-designs of old wigs, canvases and vintage silk scarves, which were transformed into hand- made couture garments. Other similarities between the two can be seen in Margiela's alternative methods in marketing and communication, where the designer continuously refused to partake in face-to-face interviews or photos, and always enforced media relations to be conducted by fax or email. Since the early 2000's he has been widely acknowledged as one of the most influential and enigmatic designers on the global fashion stage. In December 2009, it was reported that Martin Margiela had quietly left the fashion house. In an interview with Women's Wear Daily in 2004, Rosso explained his admiration for Maison Margiela: \\"It's about being unique, and it appeals to people with strong personalities who don't want to follow the crowd.\\" Following an investment phase by Rosso to improve production and sales, open more boutiques and add product lines, Maison Margiela had by 2005 increased their sales to €30 million, compared to €15 million in 2002. In 2008 the company showed profitability for the first time since the acquisition, reaching sales above €60 million. In an interview with Suzy Menkes in 2005, Rosso explained the success as the result of a new management structure within the company, which Rosso had initiated to give Martin Margiela more freedom and time for creativity. \\"He can just create, I take care of all the rest.\\" Further on, Rosso explained that Martin Margiela himself was always fully independent.\\" During the first years following the acquisition there were various rumors of problems between the two. However, this was frequently denied from both sides. In a unique letter dialogue between Malcolm McLaren and Martin Margiela, published by The New York Times in 2005, McLaren asked how it was working for the \\"tough, swaggering cowboy\\" Renzo Rosso. Margiela's response was \\"We are very, very happy with the way our collaboration with Renzo is building. Renzo has brought us more stability, financial and spiritual – we are growing together in the best way possible.\\" =Marni= On December 20, 2012, OTB acquired Marni, an Italian fashion house founded by the Castiglioni family in 1994. Following the deal, founder Gianni Castiglioni said, \\"I am satisfied of the agreement reached with OTB. This is an extraordinary opportunity of further development for our company, whilst preserving the brand's identity and the entrepreneurial spirit of our family.\\" In a comment to The New York Times’ Suzy Menkes, Rosso said he believed he could help Marni achieve \\"new, incredible goals.\\" In an interview with WWD, he explained that \\"Marni represents exactly the concept of fashion I would love to see associated with OTB – a style that's unique, recognizable, individual, fresh and modern; an international outlook.\\" After months of speculation, the purchase was met with a positive response across the fashion industry and boosted Rosso's plans of developing a modern fashion conglomerate with OTB. WWD credited the deal to further help Marni's international expansion, while Reuters reported it being \\"a rare case in a luxury industry where most deals are made in France and Asia\\", that \\"confirms Rosso as a dynamic fashion entrepreneur in Italy.\\" Though Italy is among the top fashion producers in the world, it has not seen as much unification within the industry compared to France, much due to its fragmented, family-owned industry\\". =Viktor & Rolf= In July 2008, Rosso purchased the majority of the stakes of Viktor & Rolf. Following the deal, Rolf Snoeren, of Viktor & Rolf said to The New York Times \\"We have high ambitions. We talked for two years because it is such an important step. We wanted to make sure we marry the right partner. Renzo understands creativity and has the vision and power to make a success.\\" Rosso's ability to do the unexpected is evident in the history of Viktor & Rolf as well, who have been described as the fashion industry's most 'unpredictable showmen'. While their collections are always highly anticipated for their level of entertainment and amusement, their shows tend to utilize astonishing techniques. For instance, once they had models wearing clothing upside down and carrying their own bulky lighting structures. In their famous \\"One Woman Show\\" in 2003, they employed actress Tilda Swinton, and models that resembled her, for the complete catwalk. For the spring/summer presentation in Paris, 2009, the duo controversially opted to broadcast their show solely on the Internet, instead of doing a live runway. In 2008, the same year that the brand was purchased by Rosso, a retrospective exhibition of their work was held at the Barbican Centre in London, Europe's largest performing arts center. To much acclaim of the press, the show included many pieces of the designers' famous dolls. = Brave Kid Results= In retrospect, the acquisitions by Rosso have widely been considered financially and artistically successful on mutual levels. For Staff International the turnover grew from €25 million to €200 million following the first years of the acquisition. As DSquared2 emerged from underground status to a major brand in 2003, Rosso was credited to be one of its key factors to success and in 2009, British daily newspaper The Times credited Rosso for making it a globally recognized brand. Additionally, many of the designers have acknowledged Rosso for how he has respected their creative freedom. In 2005, Martin Margiela himself said in a public statement how much he appreciated working with Rosso. In 2010, Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren of Viktor & Rolf said \\"Rosso is unique, a businessman who is also creative and would not interfere with our aesthetic and quality-control. He is the perfect fit\\".First Person  Viktor & Rolf say Flowerbomb was their modern day business weapon − BoF – The Business of Fashion Style and vision Called the 'King of high-end casual wear' by The New York Times, Rosso has been credited for establishing the market for premium denim and creating the prêt-a-porter of casual wear. =Creative vision= In Rosso's original idea for Diesel he envisioned creating denim-centric casual wear that had its own distinctive style, and which lead but didn't follow common trends. In 2008, Rosso explained: \\"I was born in the 1950s, and I grew up with the 'American myth' in my head and in my eyes: James Dean, Marlon Brando, Coca-Cola and, of course, jeans. I was completely fascinated by that world, as most kids were. So, when I created Diesel, it was natural for me to concentrate on the product that I felt was close to my mentality, denim.\\" At the time, denim had only recently evolved from a working-class uniform and was still relatively cheap. After Rosso acquired full control of Diesel in 1985 he began focusing on hand- treated denim, which meant he would 'age' the denim himself by scrubbing it with stones and sandpaper. In an interview with Suzy Menkes in 2003, Rosso explains the difficulty he had in the beginning with selling treated vintage- styled jeans. \\"When I started a vintage collection, nobody had heard about it. Today it is easy to talk about 'vintage'; 25 years ago when we did stonewashed jeans, customers sent them back. What guy wanted $99 jeans when $50 was the normal U.S. price? Every style step was difficult.\\" In 2001 Rosso's ambition to elevate the status of denim took another step when Diesel launched the Diesel Denim Gallery in New York City, Tokyo and Osaka. After the Diesel Creative Team had independently handcrafted each pair, the denim was showcased as art pieces part of very limited edition collections, alongside art installations made by local or international artists. A few years later, Rosso explained this ambition, saying \\"My strongest aspiration has always been to make good and quality things. I've never worked for money in my life. My passion, my strength, my enthusiasm comes from the will of making something before- and better- than others\\"Renzo Rosso: Wading in the Jean Pool  Movieline =Influences= Rosso's deep passion for vintage items has been evident in every Diesel collection since he took charge of the company in 1985. In the first Diesel collections that came in the years that followed, Rosso would mix Americana and vintage clothes with everything from science fiction to the Wild West, using props that ranged from old detergent packages to objects found in junk shops. The style created an atmosphere that enhanced the collections, store décors and advertising campaigns.Tungate, Mark: \\"Fashion Brands: Branding Style from Armani to Zara\\". Kogan Page, 2008. In a famous interview with Women's Wear Daily, Rosso once said \\"I don't believe in the concept of new. An older object has more charme than a new one, so do the stores, even when they are new they must not look so.\\" It was also this passion for vintage that became the common ground on which Rosso's background from Diesel met with the aesthetics of Martin Margiela, who has used authentic vintage garments in all of his collections since 1989. Besides 'vintage', Rosso has often said his biggest inspiration is his family, street fashion of the world, and popular culture, confessing that he regularly reads 150 magazines a month to stay up to date. Business lifeBooks= During his life Rosso has published four books, titled 'Forty' (Diesel, 1996), 'Fifty' (Gestalten Verlag, 2005), 'Be Stupid: For Successful Living' (Rizzoli, 2011) and 'Radical Renaissance 55+5' (Assouline, 2016). Published in English, Italian, German, Japanese and Korean, 'Be Stupid: For Successful Living' is a manual of practical and theoretical business advice that draws on his experience as a creative entrepreneur, where he explains how the courage to make brave decisions and the ability to see things for how they could be has helped him build a successful company. It follows the concept of Diesel's award-winning 'Be Stupid' campaign from 2009, which is based on a philosophy Rosso has practiced much throughout his life and career. Published for Rosso's 40th and 50th birthdays respectively, 'Forty' and 'Fifty' look at the key moments in Diesel's history, from its \\"jeans & workwear\\" beginnings followed by years of groundbreaking advertising, to its current premium positioning. The latter publication includes contributions from the Dalai Lama, Vivienne Westwood, Paul Smith, Alexander McQueen, Maison Margiela, Bono, Vincent Gallo, Naomi Campbell, Terry Jones, Kevin Roberts, Peter Saville, Dazed & Confused, Numéro and Vogue. Published on Renzo Rosso's 60th birthday, \\"Radical Renaissance 55+5\\" traces the evolution of his forward-thinking group of companies and features the provocative photography of eye-catching campaigns, groundbreaking runway shows, and previously unreleased behind-the-scenes images. The volume explores the worlds of design visionaries including Martin Margiela, Nicola Formichetti, John Galliano, Consuelo Castiglioni and Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren. =Management style= After taking charge of Diesel in 1985, Rosso strived to build a team of international, like-minded designers. Thereafter, and ever since Diesel established itself on the international market, Rosso has consistently credited the company's success to his hard-working staff. When Diesel was awarded \\"Advertiser of the Year\\" at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival in 1998, Rosso played a prank on the organizers. When he was asked to come onstage, he surprised the 3,000 guests by bringing his whole Creative Team on stage; all dressed the same way and wearing identical wigs that mimicked his curly hair. Before accepting the award, he introduced everyone in his team one-by-one to the audience, and explained that the prize in fact belonged to his hard-working team, not just himself. Rosso often refers to the company \\"as his other family\\" and would until the late 1990s hire every new employee himself, often by looking for creative people at unexpected locations and simply ask if they would come and work for him. Since 2000, Rosso has used Diesel's partnership with ITS as a method for scouting talented young designers, by welcoming the winning designer to complete a paid six-month internship at the company's design headquarters. Throughout his career, Rosso has encouraged his employees to feel comfortable in expressing themselves, and to dare to make risky decisions. In the book 'Fifty', Rosso's management style was explained by some of Diesel's employees as \\"he listens to you and appreciates your advice, and even though he remains the boss, he's not inflexible. The whole concept of the brand is freedom and self-expression, so he's tried to see it that we can express ourselves through our work.\\" During the 2000s, Rosso became known for throwing major parties for his employees and fans, to thank them for their contribution to the company's success. In September 2003, Rosso and Diesel organized a large party for its employees and people living in Rosso's hometown, Bassano del Grappa, to celebrate the company's 25th anniversary. During a 15-hour festival that featured performances by Moby, Jovanotti, Puppetmastaz and DJ Yoda, among others, 25,000 square meters of parkland was transformed into \\"Dieseland\\". The event entertained more than 40,000 visitors, including celebrities like Naomi Campbell, who had flown in just for the occasion. In October 2008, when Diesel was about to celebrate its 30th anniversary, Rosso had requested the company \\"once and for all show the world how to throw a good party\\". This resulted in a massive event that took place across 17 major cities around the world during 24 hours. It featured performances by artists like MIA., Chaka Khan, and N.E.R.D., totalled more than 80,000 visitors onsite, and more than one million viewers online. In 2010, Rosso threw a large party to celebrate the opening of the company's new headquarters in Breganze. The party, which also celebrated his 55th birthday and hosted more than a thousand guests, featured live performances by some of Rosso's personal friends and favorite artists, including Wyclef Jean, Pharrell Williams and Jovanotti. =Business strategy= Ever since Diesel established itself as a global fashion brand, many have seen Rosso's brave vision and bold mind as one of the key factors to Diesel's breakthroughs and overall success. Hailed by The New York Times to have \\"innovation as his permanent state of mind\\" and by Business Week to have achieved \\"one of the greatest marketing success stories in the fashion world\\", Rosso in 2004 was credited to have the \\"high-voltage vision that lifted advertising out of its moody doldrums, swept international awards and kept fashion hounds thirsting.\\" Starting with Diesel's first ads in 1991, his irreverent approach has shocked the advertising establishment, won accolades, and inspired a generation of copycats. Diesel was the first to poke fun at the marketing of fashion, starting with campaigns that pictured exaggerated overweight people wearing Diesel jeans. According to Rosso, this courage is also why he is frequently praised for foreseeing and setting trends, whether it is for design, advertising or business ventures, saying that \\"…being brave, being confident with oneself, wanting to innovate and challenge, and never being satisfied. It means being open to new things and listening to your intuition\\". One such example is when the brand was experiencing great financial growth and success in the late '90s, and Rosso decided to narrow the distribution points of sales from 10,000 to 5,000 to gain better control over the consumer's general brand experience. In an interview with the founder of i-D magazine, Terry Jones, Rosso explained \\"I actually prevented Diesel from growing too big, because I wanted us to maintain our credibility… We don't want to be the biggest- we want to be the coolest of the biggest.\\" =Investments= In the 2000s he invested his worth into an anonymous but intelligent designer, Ranieri a.k.a. RB then Rosso began to make investments through his private investment company, Red Circle. This, together with the successful growth of OTB, led to media often comparing him to French businessmen Bernard Arnault and François Pinault, the chairmen of the LVMH and Kering conglomerates, respectively, who own several of the world's leading luxury brands. However, in an interview in April 2011 with Italian daily newspaper Corriere della Sera, Rosso stated that he never intended to follow their route, but that he instead wanted to build a conglomerate that is \\"more democratic\\" and an alternative. \\"I have great respect for luxury, a sector that is doing very well, but it is too conservative. My dream, however, is to be a meeting point for the brands of new generations, who will be future leaders.\\" Rosso's first investment through Red Circle was made in March 2009, when he purchased 4.9% of the stocks in Yoox, an online mail-order retailer of multi-brand clothing which later became YOOX - Net a Porter. In the spring of 2011 he increased his shares to 6% and later stated that he was looking to purchase more shares, if anyone else was willing to sell. In April 2011, Rosso purchased a 20% stake of the start-up incubator H-Farm. The investment was one of the first major investments where a businessman from the fashion industry chose to invest in the high-tech market. Founded in 2005 and based outside Venice, H-Farm makes seed investments in new startups. With offices in Seattle, Mumbai and London, it invested $13.62 million in 26 startups during its first five years.Diesel founder invests in startup incubator H-farm  Reuters Following the deal, Rosso said \\"I'm a great fan of H-Farm which I always associate to Silicon Valley: 250 young people connected with thousands of creative people all over the world. It's like a hothouse of ideas and innovation that constantly stimulates my vision of the world and of the way to do business. The digital world fascinates and excites me, my personal investment choices are clearly showing it.\\" PhilanthropyOTB Foundation= In 2008, Rosso launched OTB Foundation, a not-for-profit organization, created with the mission to rebalance social inequality and contribute to the sustainable development of less advantaged areas and people throughout the world. Though Rosso is not a Buddhist, he stated in 2008 that he had been inspired to start the foundation after having met the Dalai Lama in 2005, who suggested Rosso use his global business possibilities to create a foundation to help the needy. In 2009, Rosso, together with Millennium Promise, started supporting the development of the Only The Brave Millennium Village, in Dioro, Mali. Following the model of the Millennium Villages, which help communities lift themselves out of extreme poverty, the first steps in Mali included distributing seeds and fertilizers to boost agriculture, providing bed nets to decrease malaria, and the construction of a new health clinic. Additionally, a new primary school, equipped and run with solar panels, was built with expanded classrooms, latrines for boys and girls and a new school kitchen. In the spring of 2010 Rosso visited the village to personally oversee the development. At a press conference in September, the CEO of Millennium Promise, John McArthur, said \\"Renzo and the OTB Foundation bring an extraordinary spirit of creativity and entrepreneurship to this collaboration, all driven by passion to end extreme poverty.\\" Later that year, Rosso was named a Millennium Promise Millennium Development Goals Global Leader at the United Nations in conjunction with the Millennium Development Goals Summit, alongside Senegalese musician and UNICEF ambassador Youssou Ndour, Microsoft-founder Bill Gates, musician and activist Bob Geldof, Queen Rania of Jordan, Nobel Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, and philanthropist Ted Turner, among others. Established in 2005, Millennium Promise is the leading international non-profit organization solely committed to supporting the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals to halve extreme poverty by 2015. In February 2012, Rosso was invited by the Permanent Mission of Italy to the United Nations to host a press conference at The United Nations together with Jeffrey Sachs, Director of The Earth Institute at Columbia University and Special Advisor to The United Nations' Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon, about the progress of Millennium Promise and the OTB Foundation. The press conference was part of a series called \\"Un caffè con...\\" (A coffee with...) that also included Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti. Following the conference, Italian newspaper La Stampa wrote \\"Take a visionary like Renzo Rosso and an insightful, realistic economist like Jeffrey Sachs, and it turns out extreme poverty really can disappear from Africa\\". On July 6, 2012, Rosso announced that the OTB Foundation would begin supporting APOPO, a social enterprise that researches, develops and disseminates detection rat technology for humanitarian purposes, a de-mining mission in Mozambique and Tuberculosis scanning in Tanzania and Mozambique. Following the investment, Rosso told Italian newspaper Il Giornale di Vicenza \\"When I heard about this project I thought it was impossible not to get involved. It is innovative and sustainable, and everything we want to support. One can't feel but admiration for a foundation like this.\\" =Brave Circle= On July 26, 2012, Rosso created the Brave Circle Fund to help people hit by the 2012 earthquakes in Emilia-Romagna, Italy. A personal endowment of 5 million Euro, was dedicated to setting up a micro-credit program for local people and small and medium enterprises who need help in reconstructing homes and businesses, but who normally would not have access to the traditional banking system because of their lack of guarantees. At launch, Rosso said the aim was to fund \\"700–800 projects with €5,000–50,000 each\\" and explained that it will be developed in collaboration with Etimos Foundation, a not-for-profit organization based in Italy, with experience in micro-finance. Following the donation, Rosso told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, \\"I was moved by the people of Emilia-Romagna's will to immediately come back to work after the earthquake. As an entrepreneur and a promoter of social entrepreneurship, I decided to help this population in the way I know best: stimulating a sustainable co- responsibility. This activity is extremely modern because it consists of concrete help from an entrepreneur to other entrepreneurs and to families, not in a welfare perspective but through a financial tool, exalting people's creativity and skills.\\" The donation was well received by national and international press, as well as on social media, who complimented Rosso for being the first entrepreneur in Italy to help other entrepreneurs utilizing microcredit. =Rialto Bridge= On December 14, The New York Times reported that Rosso would donate 5 million euros to restore Venice's famous Rialto Bridge. In a statement to WWD, Rosso said \\"A modern entrepreneur should help, not replace, the public administration that is often overburdened with costs\\", explaining that \\"Venice is close to my heart, the city where I went to university, and a point of reference for me.\\" Following the donation, Alessandro Maggioni, Venice's councilor in charge of public works, said, \\"We are facing a period of severe crisis in Italy, and even a city like Venice doesn't have the means to cover all the restoration and maintenance works its immense cultural heritage would require. This is why Renzo Rosso's commitment is so important for us: it is a message for the entire world.\\" Built in 1592, the bridge hasn't been restored since 1975. The restoration was expected to take 18 months, once the preliminary research was carried out, and finished in 2019. In a phone interview with the newspaper Corriere della Sera, Rosso explained \\"Master craftspeople will meticulously clean the stone, which will take some time, it's a bit like restoring a painting. The cleaning will be preceded by a careful analysis of the bridge, which will include study of the foundations by scuba divers. We want this restoration to last for the next 1,000 years.\\" =Donations= In January 2010, Rosso donated $500,000 to the people affected by the earthquake in Haiti. The funds were provided to Yéle Haiti, a foundation established by Rosso's long-term acquaintance, Wyclef Jean. In June 2008, Rosso donated 2,000,000 HKD ($250,000) to the Special Relief Fund for Children Affected by the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, established by UNICEF to help children affected by the tremor in southwest China on 12 May. Throughout the 2000s, Rosso has been a supporter of AmfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research., =Additional projects= Since 2010 Rosso has personally invested also in projects focused on his home region of Veneto, North East Italy. This includes bringing free public Wi-Fi and initiating restoration projects in his hometown of Bassano del Grappa. Awards and honors Since the early 1990s Rosso has won multiple awards across fashion, advertising and business. In 2015, Renzo Rosso received an honorary research doctorate in business economics from the University of Rome Tor Vergata. Rosso has been recognized for his efforts \\"as an entrepreneur who changed the way people intuit, imagine, think, plan and spread style and the way of dressing around the world, giving value to the territory he works in\\". In October 2011, Rosso was knighted Cavaliere del Lavoro by the President of the Republic of Italy, Giorgio Napolitano. The award ceremony took place at the Quirinale in Rome and was broadcast live on RAI in Italy. In 2010, Rosso was named Millennium Promise Millennium Development Goals Global Leader in conjunction with the Millennium Development Goals Summit, at the United Nations in New York City. Rosso received the Advertiser of the Year in 1998 and Grand Prix awards in 2010, 2009, 2007, 2001 1997, and 1992, at Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival. In 2006 Hollywood Life magazine prized Rosso with the \\"Fashion Visionary\\" award in Los Angeles, and cited Diesel \\"as one of the most innovative and successful brands in fashion.\\" In 2005, Rosso was named \\"Man of the Year\\" by the German edition of GQ; received the Pitti Imagine Award, in Florence; the Creative Vision of Business Award from the Mayor of Rome, Walter Veltroni; and the Textilwirtschaft Forum Preis in Heidelberg, for his \\"outstanding personal and business achievements in the fashion and textile industry.\\" In 2004 Rosso received the International Leading Entrepreneur Award in Monte Carlo.

In an interview with CNN in 2004, Rosso said he usually spends his free time exercizing, practicing Pilates and cycling. Besides work, Rosso has explained his biggest passion and inspiration in life is his family. He is the father of seven children. In 2001 Rosso began manufacturing and selling wine and olive oil. The products, called Rosso di Rosso (Merlot & Cabernet Sauvignon), Nero di Rosso (Pinot noir), Bianco di Rosso (Chardonnay), Grappa di Rosso (grappa), and Olio di Rosso (extra virgin olive oil) are produced at the 105-hectare Diesel Farm in Marostica, Veneto, a few kilometers from his home. Rosso is an avid art collector and enthusiast, and frequently travels to exhibitions and art fairs all around the world. Besides owning works of Andy Warhol and contemporary Italian artist Francesco Vezzoli, Basquiat, Schnabel, Fontana, Rosso has continuously pushed Diesel to support younger, talented artists, by initiating and sponsoring a wide range of projects across the arts, including Diesel New Art and Diesel Wall. In 1996, Rosso was asked to take charge of Bassano Virtus 55 S.T., the soccer team of his hometown Bassano del Grappa. As a thanks for all the local support that he has received when building the Diesel company, he began to support the team financially and also agreed to help manage the club. Since then, the team has successfully advanced from Italy's lower divisions to the country's third highest division, the Lega Pro Prima Divisione.

In addition, episode 10 in nearly its entirety was used for episode 19 of Power Rangers Dino Thunder as an English-dubbed show that the Dino Thunder Power Rangers discover on television. The cast members from the series reprised their roles for the 2014 film, Zyuden Sentai Kyoryuger vs. Go- Busters: The Great Dinosaur Battle! Farewell Our Eternal Friends. Plot Scientists believe that 65,000,000 years ago, a meteorite's crash on Earth killed off the dinosaurs, but in truth, it split Earth into two parallel universes: , an Earth where dinosaurs were still the superior species, and our Earth, referred to as by the residents of Dino Earth. Over time, the and races came into being on Dino Earth but were at war with the Evoliens, entities that emerged from the meteor. The two Earths are separate until Asuka, one of the Dragon People from Dino Earth, arrives on Earth via a transdimensional portal. However, he is followed by the Evoliens in their Anamolicarus spaceship and the three Bakuryū under their control. As the Bakuryū Tyrannosaurus, Ptreranodon, and Triceratops attack Tokyo, a call is sent out to three destined ones who possess to gain the power to tame the three beasts. Together with their Bakuryū partners, the three become Abarangers to protect their dimension from the Evoliens.

The J2F Duck was an improved version of the JF, with its main difference being a longer float.Allen 1983, p. 49. Design and development The Grumman JF Duck was manufactured from 1934 until 1936, when production switched to the J2F Duck and later variants.Jordan, Corey C. \\"Grumman's Ascendency: Chapter Two.\\" Planes and Pilots Of World War Two, 2000. Retrieved: 22 July 2011. The more obvious external appearance clue to distinguish a JF from an early J2F is the deletion of the inter-aileron strut between the wings on the J2F; less noticeable perhaps is the J2F's slightly longer rear fuselage/float joining fillet beneath the tail. The Duck's main pontoon was part of the fuselage, almost making it a flying boat, although it appears more like a standard aircraft with an added float. The XJF-1 prototype first flew on 24 April 1933 piloted by Grumman test pilot Paul Hovgard.Thruelson 'The Grumman Story' 1976, p. 77. Operational history The JF-1 that was first ordered had the same Pratt & Whitney R-1830-62 engine as the XJF-1 prototype. The US Navy ordered 27 JF-1s with the first Ducks delivered beginning in May 1934 to Norfolk NAS. These early production series had provisions for mounting a machine gun at the rear seat facing aft, as well as a single bomb rack mounted under each wing, capable of carrying a 100 lb (45.4 kg) bomb or depth charge on each. The main float was also a Grumman design (Grumman Model \\"A\\") and like the prototype, it included retractable main landing gear, making the Duck a true amphibian. Ducks served as general/utility amphibians for photographic, target-towing, scouting, and rescue work. Variants ;XJF-1: Prototype with 700 hp Pratt & Whitney R-1535-62 engine, one built (BuNo 9218).

He spent two weeks or so each year during the late summer on the Aran Islands and his many portraits of island people depicted them as rugged heroic figures. However, he ceased to visit the Aran Islands in 1965.  Life and career  Men of the South, 1921-22, Crawford Art Gallery, Cork. Seán Keating studied drawing at the Limerick Technical School before a scholarship arranged by William Orpen allowed him to go at the age of twenty to study at the Metropolitan School of Art in Dublin. Over the next few years, he spent time on the Aran Islands. In 1914 Keating won the RDS Taylor award with a painting titled The Reconciliation. The prize included £50 which allowed him to go to London to work as Orpen's studio assistant in 1915. In late 1915 or early 1916, he returned to Ireland where he documented the War of Independence and the subsequent Civil War. Examples include Men of the South (1921–22) which shows a group of IRA men ready to ambush a military vehicle and An Allegory (first exhibited in 1924), in which the two opposing sides in the Irish Civil War are seen to bury a tricolour-covered coffin amid the roots on an ancient tree. The painting includes a self-portrait of the artist. An Allegory, 1924, National Gallery of Ireland. Keating was elected an Associate of the Royal Hibernian Academy (RHA) in 1918, and a full member in 1923. One of the cardinal achievements of the Irish Free State in the 1920s was the building, in partnership with Siemens, of a hydro-electric power generator at Ardnacrusha, near Limerick. Between 1926 and 1927 Keating, at his own initiative, produced a considerable number of paintings related to this scheme. He exhibited several examples of the paintings in the RHA exhibitions in 1927 and 1928. Most are now in the collection of ESB Group. His work was also part of the art competitions at the 1924 Summer Olympics and the 1928 Summer Olympics. In 1936 a group of prominent Limerick politicians, artists and patrons established the first Limerick City Collection of Art, made up of various donations and bequests.http://gallery.limerick.ie/TheGalleryLCGA/History/ Keating was part of this artist-led initiative to form a municipal art gallery in Limerick similar to those already in Dublin and Cork. As a pivotal member of the committee, Keating himself donated many works to the collection which was first exhibited in the Savoy Cinema, Limerick City, on November 23rd, 1937. It was not until 1948, however, that an extension to the rear of Limerick Free Library and Museum became the permanent home to the City Collection, acquiring the name of the Limerick Free Art Gallery. In 1985 the Library and Museum were transferred to larger buildings.http://museum.limerick.ie/index.php/Detail/Object/Show/object_id/14324 In 1939 Keating was commissioned to paint a mural for the Irish pavilion at the New York World's Fair. He was President of the Royal Hibernian Academy from 1950 to 1962, and showed at the annual exhibition for 61 years from 1914 onwards. Keating was an intellectual painter in the sense that he consciously set out to explore the visual identity of the Irish nation, and his paintings show a very idealised realism. He feared that the modern movement would lead to a decline in artistic standards. Throughout his career, he exhibited nearly 300 works at the RHA, and also showed at the Oireachtas.Snoddy, Theo. Dictionary of Irish Artists: 20th Century, 2nd Edition. Merlin Publishing, Dublin, Ireland, 2002. Pg.300-03. Retrieved Mar. 26, 2008. Keating married political campaigner, May Walsh, in 1919. She was a frequent model for his paintings until her death in 1965. He died on 21 December 1977 at the Adelaide Hospital and was buried at Cruagh Cemetery, Rathfarnham. The 1978 RHA Exhibition featured a small memorial collection of his work. Posthumous exhibitions of his paintings were held by The Grafton Gallery, Dublin (1986) and the Electricity Supply Board (1987).

For instance, when an acid dissolves in water, a covalent bond between an electronegative atom and a hydrogen atom is broken by heterolytic fission, which gives a proton (H+) and a negative ion. Dissociation is the opposite of association or recombination. Dissociation constant For reversible dissociations in a chemical equilibrium :AB A + B the dissociation constant Kd is the ratio of dissociated to undissociated compound :K_d = \\\\mathrm{\\\\frac{[A][B]}{[AB]}} where the brackets denote the equilibrium concentrations of the species. Dissociation degree The dissociation degree is the fraction of original solute molecules that have dissociated. It is usually indicated by the Greek symbol α. More accurately, degree of dissociation refers to the amount of solute dissociated into ions or radicals per mole. In case of very strong acids and bases, degree of dissociation will be close to 1. Less powerful acids and bases will have lesser degree of dissociation. There is a simple relationship between this parameter and the van 't Hoff factor i. If the solute substance dissociates into n ions, then :i = 1 + \\\\alpha (n - 1) For instance, for the following dissociation :KCl K+ \\\\+ Cl− As n = 2, we would have that i = 1 + \\\\alpha. Salts See also: Solubility equilibrium The dissociation of salts by solvation in a solution like water means the separation of the anions and cations. The salt can be recovered by evaporation of the solvent. An electrolyte refers to a substance that contains free ions and can be used as an electrically conductive medium. Most of the solute does not dissociate in a weak electrolyte whereas in a strong electrolyte a higher ratio of solute dissociates to form free ions. A weak electrolyte is a substance whose solute exists in solution mostly in the form of molecules (which are said to be \\"undissociated\\"), with only a small fraction in the form of ions. Simply because a substance does not readily dissolve does not make it a weak electrolyte. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) and ammonium (NH4+) are good examples. Acetic acid is extremely soluble in water, but most of the compound dissolves into molecules, rendering it a weak electrolyte. Weak bases and weak acids are generally weak electrolytes. In an aqueous solution there will be some CH3COOH and some CH3COO− and H+. A strong electrolyte is a solute that exists in solution completely or nearly completely as ions. Again, the strength of an electrolyte is defined as the percentage of solute that is ions, rather than molecules. The higher the percentage, the stronger the electrolyte. Thus, even if a substance is not very soluble, but does dissociate completely into ions, the substance is defined as a strong electrolyte. Similar logic applies to a weak electrolyte. Strong acids and bases are good examples such as HCl, and H2SO4. These will all exist as ions in an aqueous medium. Gases The degree of dissociation in gases is denoted by the symbol α where α refers to the percentage of gas molecules which dissociate. Various relationships between Kp and α exist depending on the stoichiometry of the equation. The example of dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4) dissociating to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) will be taken. :N2O4 2NO2 If the initial concentration of dinitrogen tetroxide is 1 mole per litre, this will decrease by α at equilibrium giving, by stoichiometry, 2α moles of NO2. The equilibrium constant (in terms of pressure) is given by the equation; :K_p = \\\\frac\\\\ce{p(NO2)^2}\\\\ce{p(N2O4)} Where p represents the partial pressure. Hence, through the definition of partial pressure and using pT to represent the total pressure and x to represent the mole fraction; :K_p = \\\\frac\\\\ce{{p_T}^2(x(NO2))^2}\\\\ce{p_T\\\\cdot x(N2O4)} = \\\\frac\\\\ce{p_T(x(NO2))^2}\\\\ce{x(N2O4)} The total number of moles at equilibrium is (1-α)+(2α) which is equivalent to 1+α. Thus, substituting the mole fractions with actual values in term of alpha and simplifying; :K_p = \\\\frac\\\\ce{p_T(4\\\\alpha^2)}{(1+\\\\alpha)(1-\\\\alpha)} = \\\\frac\\\\ce{p_T(4\\\\alpha^2)}{1-\\\\alpha^2} This equation is in accordance with Le Chatelier's Principle. Kp will remain constant with temperature. The addition of pressure to the system will increase the value of pT so α must decrease to keep Kp constant. In fact, increasing the pressure of the equilibrium favours a shift to the left favouring the formation of dinitrogen tetroxide (as on this side of the equilibrium there is less pressure since pressure is proportional to number of moles) hence decreasing the extent of dissociation α. Acids in aqueous solution The reaction of an acid in water solvent is often described as a dissociation :HA <=> {H+} + {A^-} where HA is a proton acid such as acetic acid, CH3COOH. The double arrow means that this is an equilibrium process, with dissociation and recombination occurring at the same time. This implies that the acid dissociation constant :K_{\\\\ce a} = \\\\ce{\\\\frac{[H^+] [A^-]}{[HA]}} However a more accurate description is provided by the Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory, which specifies that the proton H+ does not exist as such in solution but is instead accepted by (bonded to) a water molecule to form the hydronium ion H3O+. The reaction is therefore more correctly written as :{HA} + H2O <=> {H3O+} + A^- and better described as an ionization or formation of ions (for the case when HA has no net charge). The equilibrium constant is then :K_{\\\\ce a} = \\\\ce{\\\\frac{[H_3O^+] [A^-]}{[HA]}} where [H_2O] is not included because in dilute solution the solvent is essentially a pure liquid with a thermodynamic activity of one. Ka is variously named a dissociation constant,Laidler K.J. Physical Chemistry with Biological Applications (Benjamin/Cummings) 1978, p.307 an acid ionization constant, an acidity constantAtkins P. and de Paula J. Physical Chemistry (8th ed. W.H.Freeman 2006) p.763 or an ionization constant. It serves as an indicator of the acid strength: stronger acids have a higher Ka value (and a lower pKa value). Fragmentation Fragmentation of a molecule can take place by a process of heterolysis or homolysis. Receptors Receptors are proteins that bind small ligands. The dissociation constant Kd is used as indicator of the affinity of the ligand to the receptor. The higher the affinity of the ligand for the receptor the lower the Kd value (and the higher the pKd value).

It is the fourth instalment in the Superman film series, set after the events of Superman III (1983) and serving as a spin-off of the series. The film stars Helen Slater as Supergirl, along with Faye Dunaway, Hart Bochner, Peter Cook, Mia Farrow, Brenda Vaccaro, and Peter O'Toole, with Marc McClure reprising his role as Jimmy Olsen from the Superman films. The film was released in the United Kingdom on 19 July 1984 and in the United States on 21 November 1984, but failed to impress critics and audiences alike. Dunaway and O'Toole earned Golden Raspberry Award nominations for Worst Actress and Worst Actor, respectively. However, Slater was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Actress. The film's failure ultimately led producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind to sell the Superman film rights to The Cannon Group, Inc. in 1986. Its first DVD release was by the independent home video company Anchor Bay Entertainment in 2000, under license from then-rights holder StudioCanal. Warner Bros. Pictures acquired the rights to the film and reissued it on DVD late in 2006 to coincide with the release of Superman Returns. Although it is canon with the Christopher Reeve and Brandon Routh Superman films, it is not included in any of the Superman DVD or Blu-ray box sets by Warner Bros. Plot Kara Zor-El lives in an isolated Kryptonian community named Argo City, in a pocket of trans-dimensional space. A man named Zaltar allows Kara to see a unique and immensely powerful item known as the Omegahedron, which he has borrowed without the knowledge of the city government, and which powers the city. However, after a mishap, the Omegahedron is blown out into space. After overhearing the wariness of her parents, Kara follows it to Earth (undergoing a transformation into \\"Supergirl\\" in the process) in an effort to recover it and save the city. On Earth, the Omegahedron is recovered by Selena, a power-hungry would-be witch assisted by the feckless Bianca, seeking to free herself from her relationship with warlock Nigel. Whilst not knowing exactly what it is, Selena quickly realizes that the Omegahedron is powerful and can enable her to perform real magical spells. Supergirl arrives on Earth and discovers her new powers. Following the path of the Omegahedron, she takes the name Linda Lee, identifies herself as the cousin of Clark Kent, and enrolls at an all-girls school where she befriends Lucy Lane, the younger sister of Lois Lane who happens to be studying there. Supergirl also meets and becomes enamoured with Ethan, who works as a groundskeeper at the school. Ethan also catches the eye of Selena, who drugs him with a love potion (which will make him fall in love with the first person he sees for a day); however, Ethan regains consciousness in Selena's absence and wanders out into the streets. An angry Selena uses her new-found powers to animate a construction vehicle which she sends to bring Ethan back, causing chaos in the streets as it does so. Supergirl, in the guise of Linda Lee, rescues Ethan, and he falls in love with her instead. Supergirl and Selena proceed to battle; calling up her new powers, Selena captures Ethan. Then she traps Supergirl and sends her to the Phantom Zone, which strips Supergirl of her powers. Wandering the bleak landscape, Supergirl falls into a volcanic bog; she drags herself to safety but then passes out. Zaltar, who has exiled himself to the Phantom Zone as a punishment for losing the Omegahedron, finds Kara unconscious. After she wakes up, Zaltar convinces Kara to escape and sacrifices his life to help her do so. Back on Earth, Selena misuses the Omegahedron to make herself a \\"princess of Earth\\" with Ethan as her lover and consort. Emerging from the Phantom Zone through a mirror, Supergirl regains her powers and confronts Selena, who uses the Omegahedron's power to summon a gigantic shadow demon. The demon overwhelms Supergirl and is on the verge of defeating her when she hears Zaltar's voice urging her to fight on. Supergirl breaks free and is told by Nigel that the only way to defeat Selena is to turn the shadow demon against her. Supergirl quickly complies and begins flying in circles around her, trapping her in a tornado. Selena is attacked and incapacitated by the monster as the whirlwind pulls Bianca in as well. The three of them are sucked back into the mirror portal, which promptly reforms, trapping them all within forever. Free from Selena's spell, Ethan admits his love for Linda. He says he knows that she and Supergirl are one-and-the same, but also knows it is possible he may never see her again and understands she must save Argo City. The final scene shows Kara returning the Omegahedron to a darkened Argo City, which promptly lights up again.

His non-appearance in the film is explained via a news broadcast (overheard by Selena) stating that Superman has left Earth on a \\"peace-seeking mission\\" to a distant galaxy. Director Jeannot Szwarc said in the Superman documentary You Will Believe... that Reeve's involvement in this film would have given the feature higher credibility, and he admitted he wished Reeve had made a contribution to the film's production. A publicity photo of him as Superman, however, did appear as a poster in Lucy and Linda's shared dorm room. Marc McClure makes his fourth of five appearances in the Superman- related films; he is the only actor to appear in all four films featuring Superman and this spin-off film. Demi Moore auditioned for and was cast as character Lucy Lane but bowed out to make the film Blame It on Rio. Maureen Teefy was signed instead. Production Upon gaining the film rights for Superman: The Movie in 1978, Alexander Salkind and his son, Ilya, also purchased the rights to the character of Supergirl, should any sequel or spin- off occur. After the critical and commercial disappointment of Superman III, the Salkinds opted to make a Supergirl movie to freshen the franchise. Ilya later recounted, \\"[It was] something different, to an extent. I thought it was a very different area to explore.\\" The producers attempted, and failed, to get the services of Richard Lester, who had directed Superman III and had completed the second film after their dismissal of original director Richard Donner. Robert Wise also turned down the director's chair. But French filmmaker Jeannot Szwarc, whose best-known work up to that time was mainly in television and directing Jaws 2, was ultimately chosen after a meeting with Christopher Reeve, who had complimented the Somewhere in Time director. Szwarc sought advice from Donner over some technical aspects of the production. Hundreds of actresses tested for the role of Supergirl/Linda, among them Demi Moore and Brooke Shields. Shields and Moore were both ultimately rejected by both Ilya and Szwarc, who had both wanted an unknown actress, and they instead signed Helen Slater. Slater was paid $75,000. Dolly Parton turned down the role of Selena before it was offered to Dunaway. Much of the film was shot at Pinewood Studios in London. Production took place between the summer and fall of 1983. Although the Salkinds financed the film completely on their own budget, Warner Bros. Pictures was still involved in the production since the studio owned the distribution rights to the film, and its parent company, Warner Communications, was also the parent company of DC Comics, owners of all \\"Superman and Superman family\\" copyrights. The entire film was shot, edited and overseen under the supervision of Warner Bros. Warners only had a July 1984 slot open for Supergirl, but the producers insisted on opening it during the holiday season. That conflict, along with the disappointing critical and financial performance of Superman III, prompted the studio to relinquish its distribution rights of Supergirl to the Salkinds.Rossen, Jake (2008).

Music The film score for Supergirl was composed and conducted by veteran composer Jerry Goldsmith, who had been the initial interest of director Richard Donner to compose for the first Superman film.Ilya Salkind, Pierre Spengler, Superman DVD audio commentary, 2006, Warner Home Video Goldsmith used a number of techniques to identify the music to the film, such as synthesizers simulating the sounds of take-off during the main theme.Supergirl soundtrack review.

U.S. version in 1985. The film has since been released several times on home video, laserdisc, and DVD. In 1990, the same 105 minute U.S. cut was re-released on VHS by Avid Home Entertainment. By the mid-1990s, the rights to the film were acquired by Pueblo Film Licensing (successor-in-interest to the Salkind production company) and French production company StudioCanal. By this time Anchor Bay Entertainment had assumed the video rights, where it was re-issued on VHS in 1998 as the \\"114-minute cut\\" under the Anchor Bay Entertainment Family Movies label. For their DVD release in 2000, two versions were issued. The first of these was a 2-disc \\"Limited Edition\\" set (limited to 50,000 copies only) featuring the 124-minute \\"International Version\\" (never seen in the United States, which was digitally mastered by THX for this DVD release), along with a 138-minute \\"director's cut\\", which had been discovered in StudioCanal's archives. The second version was a single-disc version featuring the 124-minute \\"International Version\\", with many bonus features: a 16-page full color booklet; Audio Commentary with Director Jeannot Szwarc and Special Project Consultant Scott Michael Bosco; \\"The Making of Supergirl\\" Featurette; U.S. & Foreign Theatrical Trailers; U.S. TV Spots; Original Storyboards; Still & Poster Galleries; and Talent Bios (these extra features were also available on the 2-disc \\"Limited Edition\\" set). Anchor Bay re-issued a new VHS release once again, this time the 124-minute \\"International Version\\" coinciding with the DVD release, both a separate fullscreen and widescreen editions (widescreen version labeled as the \\"Collector's Edition\\") under different packaging artwork and digitally mastered by THX. The \\"Director's Cut\\" DVD was made from the last print known to exist of the cut, which was apparently prepared for possible television broadcast before the film was edited into its various versions. This longer version was never broadcast on network television in the United States, though it is believed to have been distributed in syndication worldwide. In 2002, Anchor Bay re-issued the 138 minute \\"Director's Cut\\" separately. In November 2006, coinciding with the home video release of Superman Returns, Warner Home Video, now owning the rights to the film through their parent company Warner Bros., released a single-disc DVD featuring the 124-minute \\"International Version\\" cut of the film, with only some extra material being carried over from the former out-of-print Anchor Bay releases, a commentary by director Jeannot Szwarc and Special Project Consultant Scott Bosco, and the theatrical trailer. This Warner Bros. release includes an edited version of the audio commentary from the Anchor Bay release. All comments about Anchor Bay are edited out. It was reissued on 17 July 2018, under the Warner Archive Collection label as a two–disc set, with the International Cut on Blu-ray (in a new 1080p HD remaster), and the \\"Director's Cut\\" on DVD, mastered in SD as the only surviving element of the longer version is from the same StudioCanal print used for the previous Anchor Bay release. The commentary from the 2000 video release, \\"The Making of Supergirl\\" Featurette, and a theatrical trailer were carried over to WAC's latest issue. =Deleted material= alt=Prototype costume Material that was cut for the 105-minute version of the film included the Argo City opening, which was originally longer. Another cut scene from the US release is known as the \\"flying ballet\\", though included in the International Cut. As Supergirl arrives on Earth, she is surprised to find herself capable of almost anything, especially flying. She can use her super-strength to crack rocks into dust, and use her heat-ray vision to help flowers grow. Scenes concerning Selena, Bianca, and Nigel were also trimmed. In the U.S. version, Selena's introduction was merely a few lines long when the Omegahedron lands on Earth, and Selena takes it for use of its magic. The full introduction establishes Selena as an impatient witch, who is sick of her mentor and lover, Nigel, who is himself, a warlock. Later scenes not seen before the 2000 DVD release from Anchor Bay Entertainment, include Selena using the Omegahedron for the first time, and realizing that she has no control of herself when under its influence, namely the \\"Roast Chicken\\" sequence. Selena later throws a party for all her followers, and deleted material shows Nigel insulting Selena after being dismissed. Nigel then gets friendly with another party member, on whom Selena pulls a vicious magical prank. Other scenes involve Linda Lee making a temporary home in the city of Midvale, Illinois, and an extended version of the tractor sequence in which the possessed machine runs amok on the Midvale streets and kills a civilian. This alleged death scene does not appear in either the International or the 2000 Director's Cut. Another cut scene shows Supergirl unable to find the Omegahedron because Selena keeps it in a lead box, demonstrating that Supergirl's limitations are similar to those of her cousin. The Phantom Zone scenes are also longer. The 2006 DVD release and current Blu-Ray reissue by Warner Home Video, whose parent company, Warner Bros., is the current rights holder to the Superman movies, contains the International Edition, also called the \\"European Theatrical Edition\\". The latter release also features the aforementioned \\"director's cut\\". Much of the deleted material appeared in DC Comics's one-shot comic book adaptation of the film, primarily the scenes that fleshed out Selena's character. Broadcast television version The American theatrical cut for Supergirl ran at 105 minutes. Supergirl originally ran at 124 minutes in its European version. When it aired on network television in 1987, ABC added numerous scenes from the International theatrical version as well as sequences not contained in any other edit. Shown in a two-hour slot, this 92-minute version was essentially a cut-down version of the \\"Director's Cut\\", otherwise resembling the U.S. edit, with \\"offensive\\" dialogue dubbed over for TV. This same 92-minute version was also seen in syndication on most stations (as well as superstations such as TBS and WGN) by Viacom. Some broadcast television versions have a scene not seen in either laserdisc edition: After Selena's defeat, Nigel is standing on the street. He bends over to pick up the Coffer of Shadows, now restored to its original, small size and decides to keep it as a memento. In another broadcast-only scene, after Supergirl flies off to return to Argo City, Ethan gets into his truck. He then stops to say goodbye to Lucy and Jimmy. Both scenes can be found in the director's cut. As aforementioned, the full longer version has never been broadcast on U.S. network television. ReceptionBox office= In the United States, Supergirl was picked up by Tri-Star Pictures for release on 21 November 1984. Test audiences found the film overlong and the film was edited from 135 minutes to 105 minutes for its North American release. Critical reviews in the United States were poor, and although the film took the #1 slot at the North American box-office during its opening weekend, it is widely considered to be a box office bomb after making only $14.3 million in North America. =Critical response= Supergirl holds a 9% approval rating and has an average rating of 3.2/10 on Rotten Tomatoes based on 32 reviews. The consensus reads: \\"The effects are cheesy and Supergirl's wide-eyed, cheery heroine simply isn't interesting to watch for an hour and a half.\\" The film has a Metacritic rating of 42, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\" from 12 professional reviewers.https://www.metacritic.com/movie/supergirl Variety referred to the film as \\"intermittently enjoyable spectacle\\" and described \\"some well-staged effects highlights, notably a violent storm that threatens the school and the climax which Supergirl and Selena confront each other in the latter's mountain-top castle.\\" Both Rita Kempley and Paul Attanasio of the Washington Post gave it positive marks. John Grant, writing in The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, was more positive about the film, describing Slater as \\"an exceptionally charming Supergirl\\" and wrote that Supergirl had some \\"excellent—and excellently realised—flights of imagination.\\"Clute, John and Grant, John. The Encyclopedia of Fantasy. London : Orbit, 1997. (p. 907). Grant criticised the \\"inconsistent\\" characterization of Slater and Dunaway's characters. Summing up, he stated while Supergirl \\"was less than the sum of its parts, not all of those parts are insignificant.\\" =Accolades= The film was nominated for two Razzie Awards, including Worst Actor for Peter O'Toole and Worst Actress for Faye Dunaway. Helen Slater was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Actress. Other mediaNovelization= A novelization was written by Norma Fox Mazer and released in paperback form in 1984.

It differs from a typical O'Neill play in its happy ending for the central character, and depiction of a happy family in turn of the century America. It is O'Neill's only well-known comedy. The play was successful in its first Broadway production and the touring production that followed. It has since become a staple of community repertory. Plot summary The play takes place on the Fourth of July 1906 and focuses on the Miller family, presumably of New London, Connecticut. The main plot deals with the middle son, 16-year-old Richard, and his coming of age in turn-of-the-century America. \\"Perhaps the most atypical of the author's works, the play presents a sentimental tale of youthful indiscretion in a turn-of-the-century New England town.\\" Title The title derives from Quatrain XII of Edward Fitzgerald's translation of the Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám (5th edition, 1889), one of Richard's favorite poems: :A Book of Verses underneath the Bough, :A Jug of Wine, a Loaf of Bread—and Thou :Beside me singing in the Wilderness— :Oh, Wilderness were Paradise enow! Opening night credits Around the table in the original 1933 Broadway production of Ah, Wilderness! are (from left) George M. Cohan (Nat Miller), Eda Heinemann (Lily), Elisha Cook, Jr. (Richard), Gene Lockhart (Sid), Marjorie Marquis (Mrs. Nat Miller), Walter Vonnegut, Jr. (Tommy) and Adelaide Bean (Mildred).

Reception The play was included in Burns Mantle's The Best Plays of 1933–1934 with George M. Cohan in the cast and again as a revival in 1941–42. In a review of a 1998 production of the play at The Huntington Theatre in Boston, the reviewer noted O'Neill, who \\"penned [it] in a single month in 1932, the Harvard educated playwright takes a well deserved vacation from this cold and unrelenting world, and gives us a surprisingly warm portrayal of middle-class family life in \\"large small-town America.\\"\\" He further remarked about the play \\"The character Richard Miller was clearly modeled on O'Neill's image of himself as an aspiring poet, but unlike O'Neill, Richard's rebellion is quelled and his craving for romantic endeavors extinguished by a loving family who cares and wishes him the best.\\" Adaptations The Campbell Playhouse presentation of \\"Ah, Wilderness\\" (September 17, 1939) The play was made into a 1935 film of the same title and again in 1948 as the musical Summer Holiday. Mickey Rooney starred as Tommy in the former and Richard in the latter. The success of the first film led MGM to reunite much of the cast in another film based on a small town coming of age play, A Family Affair, which became the basis for the Andy Hardy series. The play was also adapted for the radio on The Campbell Playhouse produced by and starring Orson Welles on September 17, 1939. It was also adapted for Theatre Guild On The Air on October 7, 1945, The Ford Theatre on November 2, 1947, and Studio One on July 15, 1948. The story was also made into the 1959 Broadway musical Take Me Along starring Jackie Gleason as the drunken Uncle Sid (Beery's role in the film), Walter Pidgeon as Nat and Robert Morse as Richard. The production ran for 448 performances. Gleason won the 1960 Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical. A revival in 1984 had a successful run for six months in Connecticut and Washington, D.C. but closed on Broadway after only a short debut and a week of previews.

It became known for inhumane conditions and poor treatment of its patients, and became the target of a series of lawsuits prior to its eventual closing in 1992. The building complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. Conditions and treatment of patients Located at 30 State Street, the campus contains 10 major buildings built in a Colonial Revival style by Kendall, Taylor, and Co. The state schools of Massachusetts were different from state hospitals; the latter were for the mentally ill, while state schools were institutions for the mentally defective (the name is a misnomer, as they did not generally involve any form of education). Throughout its first 40 years, Belchertown operated mostly without scrutiny from outside sources. Author Benjamin Ricci (whose son lived at the school, and who later led a class-action lawsuit protesting the conditions there) referred to the conditions as \\"horrific,\\" \\"medieval,\\" and \\"barbaric.\\" Doctors at the school had little regard for patients' mental capacity, evidenced by this quote: > His method of evaluating me consisted of looking me over during the physical > exam and deciding that since I couldn't talk and apparently couldn't > understand what he was saying, I must be an imbecile. [...] Since I couldn't > ask him to speak up or repeat what he said, he assumed I was a moron. > (Sienkewicz-Mercer p38) Attendants on the wards were overworked, with dozens of patients in each ward. Because there was not enough time for proper toilet care, residents were left \\"half-naked rolling in their own excrement.\\" Healthy teeth were often removed from handicapped patients to make feeding them easier. Those who were severely physically handicapped were left in their beds the entire day, without any form of entertainment. Patients unable to feed themselves were force-fed by the attendants (Sienkewicz-Mercer, p. 42); when it was necessary to move a patient, the attendants did so roughly, sometimes causing injuries. As a result of this gross mistreatment, some patients were prone to \\"moaning in the hallways,\\" \\"reaching into [their] diapers and spreading whatever [they] found all over, [...] repeatedly banging their heads against the walls,\\" (Sienkewicz-Mercer, p. 50) or any of a number of other responses. Additionally, the facility suffered from vermin infestation. Changing attitudes towards mental retardation The reason for this situation was partly due to the prevailing cultural perspective of what was often called \\"mental deficiency\\". Around the turn of the 20th century, many people with handicaps were simply kept at home when possible. This changed in the 1920s and 1930s because state governments and bureaucracies developed special divisions to manage these individuals—in Massachusetts and elsewhere, this was the role of the Massachusetts Department of Mental Retardation. In addition, expertise on \\"the infirm\\" became a specialty in the medical world, which in turn helped shape social policy. And while few parents would want to send their child to live in squalor and suffer abuse, many felt they had no other choice as there was simply nowhere else for a child with severe disabilities to go. Doctors at the time would often tell them that this was the only way for their other children to have a normal childhood. Beginning in the Kennedy administration, and partly due to the civil rights movement started by African Americans, awareness of disabled people as individuals with human rights increased. In 1966, Massachusetts passed the Mental Health and Retardation Services Act, which mandated a gradual transition from a few institutions around the state to a more community-based system of care facilities. Coincidentally, a conscientious objector to the Vietnam war was arranging for a group of six mobility impaired, non-retarded to move into \\"Prospect House\\" in Cambridge, Mass. These men would still commute to their highly paid day jobs at the tool and die factory abutting Fernald; but with the alliance with the Cambridge-Somerville Assn. for Retarded Children (as it was then known), efforts to socialize these men into community living were undertaken. This enabled Fernald to join Brandeis' Florence Heller School in undertaking the creation of a community residential program. Working to create partnerships with Associations for Retarded Citizens, mobilizing staff on the units, and working with the families of residents to educate them on the concepts of normalization, these efforts were rewarded with the opening of a community residence for eight moderately retarded women on Morse St., in Watertown, MA in 1970. From this beginning, state-private collaboration expanded and community residential and support programs began to flourish.[citations needed] The horrendous conditions at Belchertown were revealed in 1971 in a newspaper article entitled \\"The Tragedy of Belchertown\\". Parents sued the school, and when the state Attorney General toured the facility, he described it as \\"a hell hole\\". This was the first lawsuit against a state school, and others followed in Massachusetts for the next few years. In 1973, the unnecessary death of a patient resulted in a lawsuit that saw the hiring of nearly 100 new ward personnel. In 1975, Belchertown was sued once again for denying its patients the right to vote (this was one of the first disability- related voting rights cases in the United States), and in 1977 a case was brought against the school on behalf of a 67-year-old mentally ill man unable to properly take care of himself with leukemia to determine if a court- appointed guardian ad litem could refuse treatment on his behalf. School closure and redevelopment After hobbling along for several more years, Belchertown State Schools were finally closed in 1992. Two years later it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. More recent improvements have been the makeover of Foley Field into a baseball diamond for the local Little League team, and restoration of the overgrown cemetery (with numbers marking the graves) to appear cleaner and properly memorialize dead patients by name. In 2001, a town meeting designated the school property as an Economic Opportunity Area for 20 years. This economic development plan provides tax incentives to businesses who establish themselves on the site. As of November 14, 2012, the town of Belchertown had decided on a $1.25 million project, that would hand over the ownership of the land to a new owner. The new owners plan was to demolish the existing buildings which contained asbestos. The plan was to replace them with a new facility of 170-units of assisted living homes. The project was due to be completed by Winter of 2014 but development fell under and the land owner backed out. The buildings had been boarded up and road blocks were placed, but they have remained untouched. Plans to demolish the buildings started up again in November 2014, with the same idea to create an assisted-living facility. By July 2016, two of the most notable buildings were demolished, the Hospital and the iconic Auditorium buildings. From 2015 onward, the campus underwent multiple arson attempts by vandals. The public outcry led to a significantly higher police presence and arrests that followed. For more information about Belchertown, there is a book entitled Crimes Against Humanity: A Historical Perspective. It was written by Benjamin Ricci, who sent his six-year-old son Bobby to live there not knowing what the conditions were like, and who was involved in the initial 1972 lawsuit. Another book with vivid descriptions of Belchertown is Ruth Sienkiewicz- Mercer's I Raise My Eyes to Say Yes; she was a resident of the school in the 1960s and 1970s. Sienkiewicz-Mercer's book refers to a young male nurse who worked at Belchertown in the late 1960s and early 1970s who later became a junior senator from Massachusetts. His name, she says, was John Kerry. This is a disputable statement, since Senator Kerry graduated from Yale in 1966 and served in the U.S. Navy from 1966 to 1970.  Buildings  Ground was broken at the Belchertown State School in March 1919. Construction was completed in 1922 with subsequent additions thereafter. * Administrative Block - two buildings connected by a corridor. Most known for its small white clock tower. Used for administrators only. * Cottages - nine white houses where more capable patients resided. Caretakers are asked in 1972 to vacate to make room for excess patients. All demolished by 2017. * Hospital - held approximately 50 beds for children with disabilities. The building was demolished in 2015 for redevelopment. * Infirmary - a ward where more-seriously disabled residents resided, which was demolished in 2016. * Auditorium/Gymnasium - one of the most infamous buildings at BSS. Below ground contained a gym. Demolished in 2015 after PCB concerns. * Vocational Block - a building where female patients could partake in activities such as coloring, painting, and knitting. Demolished in 2015. * Industrial Block - a building where male patients could learn carpentry, basketball, and other \\"male\\" tasks. Demolished in 2015. * A & K Wards - custodial buildings that housed male and female patients respectively. Demolished in 1977 and 1979, they symbolic acts of progress. * G Ward - the campus's newest building. Built in 1964, it was considered inadequate for the facility's residents due to its large windows and location. Demolished in 2017. * Custodials - wards that were nicknamed after their \\"+, or plus\\" shaped layout. The Belchertown campus was littered with these custodials. * Kitchen Block - a building where residents could receive meals. Sewage often spewed out of the drains and onto the kitchen and dining hall floors. * Cannery - where unused food was canned and preserved for future use. * Drying Ground - resident laundry was processed here. Like many other state schools, residents often never ended up wearing the same clothes after laundry as it was often lost. * Maintenance - includes a garage, loading dock, and shed for the general upkeep of the facility. * Power Station - generated steam power for the facility until the complex switched to supplied power by a third-party sometime in the 1970s. The building was still used as a warehouse. * Numerous fallout shelters are located within the forest surrounding the Belchertown State School campus. Collaboration with University of Massachusetts students In late 2008, Belchertown State School campus was the focus of an interdisciplinary studio done by 30 graduate students within the Departments of Architecture and Landscape Architecture and Regional Planning at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Four teams of landscape architects, architects and regional planners studied the campus, the town, and its surrounding context. The focus of the studio was to get down to the site planning level dealing with the integration of interior and exterior spaces. The parcel of land, owned by the Belchertown Economic Development and Industrial Corporation, is ripe with opportunity. The teams looked at creating jobs, mixed use development as well as recreational opportunities on the campus and the adjacent property, owned by New England Small Farm Institute. The site has dozens of buildings that are beyond repair, but the majority of the substantial buildings on site would provide a strong starting point to build a community around. Landscape architect and architect students worked to integrate these buildings and the landscape together, while the regional planners looked at the feasibility of the proposals as well as zoning regulations and potential overlays. The final product was four detailed master plans and a strong sense of support from the community.

It will not normally be present in any specification or declared contents of the substance, and may not be legally allowed. The addition of adulterants is called adulteration. The most common reason for adulteration is the use by manufacturers of undeclared materials that are cheaper than the correct and declared ones. The adulterants may be harmful, or reduce the potency of the product, or they may be harmless. The term \\"contamination\\" is usually used for the inclusion of unwanted substances due to accident or negligence rather than intent, and also for the introduction of unwanted substances after the product has been made. Adulteration therefore implies that the adulterant was introduced deliberately in the initial manufacturing process, or sometimes that it was present in the raw materials and should have been removed, but was not. An adulterant is distinct from, for example, permitted food preservatives. There can be a fine line between adulterant and additive; chicory may be added to coffee to reduce the cost or achieve a desired flavour—this is adulteration if not declared, but may be stated on the label. Chalk was often added to bread flour; this reduces the cost and increases whiteness, but the calcium actually confers health benefits, and in modern bread a little chalk may be included as an additive for this reason. In wartime adulterants have been added to make foodstuffs \\"go further\\" and prevent shortages. The German word ersatz is widely recognised from such practices during World War II. Such adulteration was sometimes deliberately hidden from the population to prevent loss of morale and propaganda reasons. Some goods considered luxurious in the Soviet Bloc such as coffee were adulterated to make them affordable to the general population. In food and beverages \\"How the microscope reveals adulteration\\", microscope slide comparing rice starch (left) and arrowroot (right) and a mixture of the two (center), ca.1909 Past and present examples of adulterated food, some dangerous, include: * Apple jellies (jams), as substitutes for more expensive fruit jellies, with added colorant and sometimes even specks of wood that simulate raspberry or strawberry seeds * High fructose corn syrup or cane sugar, used to adulterate honey * Red ochre–soaked brown bread to give the appearance of beef sausage for sausage roll filling.The Times, Police, 5 February 1894; pg. 14 * Roasted chicory roots used as an adulterant for coffee * Water, for diluting milk and alcoholic beverages * Water or brine injected into chicken, pork, or other meats to increase their weight * Urea, melamine and other nonprotein nitrogen sources, added to protein products to inflate crude protein content measurements History Historically, the use of adulterants has been common; sometimes dangerous substances have been used. In the United Kingdom up to the Victorian era, adulterants were common; for example, cheeses were sometimes colored with lead. Similar adulteration issues were seen in industry in the United States, during the 19th century. There is dispute over whether these practices declined primarily due to government regulation or to increased public awareness and concern over the practices. In the early 21st century, cases of dangerous adulteration occurred in the People's Republic of China. In some African countries, it is not uncommon for thieves to break electric transformers to steal transformer oil, which is then sold to the operators of roadside food stalls to be used for deep frying. When used for frying, it is reported that transformer oil lasts much longer than regular cooking oil. The downside of this misuse of the transformer oil is the threat to the health of the consumers, due to the presence of PCBs.Thieves fry Kenya's power grid for fast food, Al Jazeera, 28 December 2014 Adulterant use was first investigated in 1820 by the German chemist Frederick Accum, who identified many toxic metal colorings in food and drink. His work antagonized food suppliers, and he was ultimately discredited by a scandal over his alleged mutilation of books of the Royal Institution library. The physician Arthur Hill Hassall conducted extensive studies in the early 1850s, which were published in The Lancet and led to the 1860 Food Adulteration Act and other legislation. John Postgate led a further campaign, leading to another Act of 1875, which forms the basis of the modern legislation and a system of public analysts who test for adulteration. At the turn of the 20th century, industrialization in the United States led to a rise in adulteration which inspired some protest. Accounts of adulteration led the New York Evening Post to parody: > Mary had a little lamb, And when she saw it sicken, She shipped it off to > Packingtown, And now it's labeled chicken.Jeffrey M. Pilcher, Food in World > History New York: Routledge, 2006, p. 59 However, even in the 18th century, people complained about adulteration in food: > \\"The bread I eat in London is a deleterious paste, mixed up with chalk, alum > and bone ashes, insipid to the taste and destructive to the constitution. > The good people are not ignorant of this adulteration; but they prefer it to > wholesome bread, because it is whiter than the meal of corn [wheat].

The Patriot rebels led by Argentine general José de San Martín effectively destroyed the Spanish forces commanded by General Mariano Osorio, and completed the independence of the core area of Chile from Spanish domination. Background In 1817, the Argentine General José de San Martín led an army across the Andes and defeated the Spanish at the battles of Chacabuco and Chalchuapa and captured Santiago. The Spanish viceroyalty sent a Spanish army to Santiago under General Mariano Osorio, which defeated San Martín at the Second Battle of Cancha Rayada. The drive for independence never diminished, however, and the following year San Martín launched a final offensive, which was to decide the outcome of the war. Despite being defeated at Cancha Rayada, the Patriot army regrouped again in less than two days, adding up to about 4,000 men, allowing San Martín to rebuild his units almost entirely. Hence, on April 2, after leaving the Ochagavía camp to travel to the lower hills of Maipo, the Patriot army emerged organized in three infantry divisions with a total of 396 chiefs and approximately 5,000 lower-ranked officers and soldiers. The Royalist army meanwhile continued in its attempt to consolidate and defeat the Patriots, and after Cancha Rayada begun a persistent and extenuating persecution, which was resisted in every town and countryside, delaying its advance towards Santiago and giving the Patriots some time to reorganize and to plan the way to stop Osorio and to avoid his entrance into the capital city. Foreseeing this situation, General Bernardo O’Higgins employed some important measures which would serve the ultimate goal of defeating the Spanish, such as collecting the rifles and sabres given by Manuel Rodríguez to people after Cancha Rayada; speeding up the incoming supplies from Los Andes; acquiring or confiscating weapons held by individuals and merchants of Santiago to rearm the troops; gathering up combatants from the population coming up from the south and organizing a training camp at Ochagavía. Meanwhile, Gen. Osorio, after passing through San Fernando by the end of March, realized that he had not defeated the Patriot army conclusively at Cancha Rayada, and moreover, that the latter was fit to fight and to win. Facing this fact, another encounter between the Patriots and Royalist army near Santiago became inevitable. =Battle preparations= Both armies established their headquarters near each other in the south of Santiago, where San Martín and Osorio prepared for battle. At nightfall on 4 April the Royalist army settled at Lo Espejo, about seven kilometres from the Patriot forces. At dawn the next day, San Martín occupied the lower hills over the southern edge which runs from west to east, with Las Heras’ division to the right, Alvarado's division on the left and Quintana's division right behind them. The grenadiers were set on the extreme right and the Cazadores of the Dictatorial Army were arranged on the left flank. The artillery was divided into two brigades under Blanco Encalada and Borgoño, and protected by the infantry on the wings. Osorio arranged his army on a triangular ridge at north of Lo Espejo. Primo de Rivera's division was formed on the left wing, while the Dragones de la Frontera Regiment was deployed over the road to Valparaíso. Morla's Division was set on the western half of the triangular plateau, and the right flank was formed by the Ordoñez Division. The battle Loading Colonel Santiago Bueras during the battle. The battle began when the Patriot artillery opened fire about 11:30 AM, being immediately contested by its Royalist counterpart, although inflicting no casualties upon each other whatsoever. After a half-hour of useless shelling, San Martín ordered Las Heras and Alvarado to move forward. The infantry advanced in columns without retaliating fire, until Las Heras threw his troops against Primo de Rivera with the support of Blanco Encalada's artillery, while Alvarado did the same against Ordoñez being covered by Borgoño's batteries. The grenadiers under Zapiola were assailed by part of the Royalist cavalry, but managed to counterattack and chase the attackers to a little slope where were decimated by a dense infantry and artillery fire. Obliged to retreat, Zapiola was reinforced and attacked again, successfully dispersing the enemy's cavalry and securing the Patriot right flank. During the fray, suddenly the Patriot reserve emerged from behind Las Heras and Alvarado's lines and engaged Morla and Ordoñez divisions. Right after, the Cazadores squadrons led by Col. Ramón Freire dispersed the Spanish cavalry on the eastern flank. On this charge died Chilean Colonel Santiago Bueras. On the centre, both infantries attacked each other with intensity. Ordoñez division, reinforced with another two units – the Burgos and Arequipa battalions - charged the Patriot line, forcing it to cede a little. However, San Martín sent three battalions to the sector – The 1st and 3rd infantry battalions plus the 7th Battalion of Los Andes -, and these onsetted and split the Burgos Battalion, while the Arequipa Battalion was completely disbanded. The rest of the Royalist units formed in squares endured up to ten cavalry melees, but retreated after the centre and right wing withdrew to Lo Espejo. At this point Osorio deserted the field, leaving the Royalists under the command of Ordoñez. The latter gathered six companies of Primo de Rivera's division and the rest of the Royalist infantry and made a final stand on the farm, decimating the Coquimbo Battalion which recklessly made a frontal charge. Then, San Martín ordered Blanco Encalada and Borgoño to hammer the position with their cannons. Pushed by the Patriot infantry, Ordoñez’ men garrisoned on the houses of Lo Espejo were forced to surrender, while the militias brought by O’Higgins captured the dispersed soldiers. Results The Hug of Maipú by Pedro Subercaseaux. The battle left 2,000 Spaniards dead and 3,000 captured; the patriots lost about 1,000 men. The victory produced tremendous results. The victory brought an end to major Spanish operations in Chile. It also allowed the united Chilean and Argentine patriots to launch a series of attacks against Spanish positions along South America’s Pacific coast, climaxing with the liberation of large parts of Peru from Spanish rule. The historic victory is marked yearly every 5 April with a joint civil-military parade in Maipu, where the battle occurred (this day is Armor Day for the Chilean Army). A living history event at the last Sunday of April ends a month of national festivities in honor of the victory.

He was Minister for the Media (1972–1975) and Special Minister of State (1975) in the Whitlam Government, and ended his political career as President of the Senate (1983–1987). He resigned from the Senate to become High Commissioner to the United Kingdom (1987–1991). McClelland is the earliest surviving Senator - and along with Bill Hayden and Manfred Cross, is the earliest elected Labor MP still alive. Early life Born on 5 August 1926 in the western Sydney suburb of Wentworthville, Doug McClelland was the son of Gertrude Amy (née Cooksley) and Alfred McClelland. His father was a farmer, union organiser, and ALP politician who served two terms in the Parliament of New South Wales (1920–1927 and 1930–1932). He attended Wentworthville Public School before going on to Parramatta High School and the Metropolitan Business College in Parramatta. After leaving school he found work as a clerk in the state Agriculture Department. In 1944, five days after his 18th birthday, McClelland enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF). He was stationed for periods in New South Wales, Queensland, and the Northern Territory before being discharged in January 1947 with the rank of corporal. From 1949 he worked as a court reporter, employed by the state and federal governments. During this time he was an active member of the Australian Journalists Association. Politics McClelland joined the ALP in 1947 and was elected to the state executive in 1956. He served as the campaign secretary for his father's close friend H. V. Evatt, who was the member for Barton and served as federal leader of the ALP from 1951 to 1960. Evatt transferred to a different electorate in 1958, and McClelland lost the Barton preselection ballot to Len Reynolds by just two votes. He was elected to the Senate at the 1961 federal election, aged 35, to a term starting on 1 July 1962. McClelland was the manager of Government Business in the Senate from 9 July 1974, Minister for the Media in the Whitlam Government until 6 June 1975, and then Special Minister of State, he also served as President of the Senate from 21 April 1983 until his resignation on 23 January 1987. (He was no relation to fellow ALP cabinet minister Jim McClelland.) From 1981 until his resignation he was the Father of the Senate. In August 1981, McClelland was elected Chairman of Committees in the Senate, adding the title Deputy President in October. He defeated National Country Party senator Douglas Scott by one vote with the aid of the Democrats, marking the start of the convention that the position is held by the opposition. When the ALP won the 1983 federal election, McClelland was elected President of the Senate in place of Harold Young. In 1985 and 1986, he was represented by lawyers at the trials of Lionel Murphy, a judge of the High Court and former ALP senator, where concerns had arisen over whether parliamentarian witnesses could be examined on their conduct in parliament. McClelland subsequently introduced what became the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987, which defined and codified certain aspects of parliamentary privilege. It was \\"the first bill introduced by a presiding officer in the history of the Australian Parliament\\". McClelland retired from the Senate in January 1987, the year before the opening of the new Parliament House. He had served as chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House from 1983. Later life McClelland served as Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom from 1987 to 1991. Personal life McClelland married Lorna McNeill and they have one son—Robert McClelland, the former member for Barton—and two daughters. He was made a Companion of the Order of Australia in June 1987. McClelland was awarded the Douglas Wilkie Medal for services to non-football in 1973 by the Anti-Football League. The accolade was presented after McClelland introduced a points system for television programming.

There are many other aerobic biological processes for treatment of wastewaters, for example activated sludge, trickling filters, rotating biological contactors and biofilters. They all have in common the use of oxygen (or air) and microbial action to reduce the pollutants in wastewaters. Types *Suspension mixed lagoons, where there is less energy provided by the aeration equipment to keep the sludge in suspension. *Facultative lagoons, where there is insufficient energy provided by the aeration equipment to keep the sludge in suspension and solids settle to the lagoon floor. The biodegradable solids in the settled sludge then degrade as in an anaerobic lagoon. =Suspension mixed lagoons= Suspension mixed lagoons flow through activated sludge systems where the effluent has the same composition as the mixed liquor in the lagoon. Typically the sludge will have a residence time or sludge age of 1 to 5 days. This means that the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removed is relatively little and the effluent is therefore unacceptable for discharge into receiving waters. The objective of the lagoon is therefore to act as a biologically assisted flocculator which converts the soluble biodegradable organics in the influent to a biomass which is able to settle as a sludge. Usually the effluent is then put in a second pond where the sludge can settle. The effluent can then be removed from the top with a low COD, while the sludge accumulates on the floor and undergoes anaerobic stabilisation. Methods of aerating lagoons or basins There are many methods for aerating a lagoon or basin: * Motor-driven submerged or floating jet aerators * Motor-driven floating surface aerators * Motor-driven fixed-in- place surface aerators * Injection of compressed air through submerged diffusers =Floating surface aerators= A Typical Surface-Aerated Basin (using motor-driven floating aerators) Ponds or basins using floating surface aerators achieve 80 to 90% removal of BOD with retention times of 1 to 10 days. Available at CSA Illumina website The ponds or basins may range in depth from 1.5 to 5.0 metres. In a surface-aerated system, the aerators provide two functions: they transfer air into the basins required by the biological oxidation reactions, and they provide the mixing required for dispersing the air and for contacting the reactants (that is, oxygen, wastewater and microbes). Typically, the floating high speed surface aerators are rated to deliver the amount of air equivalent to 1 to 1.2 kg O2/kWh. However, they do not provide as good mixing as is normally achieved in activated sludge systems and therefore aerated basins do not achieve the same performance level as activated sludge units. With low speed surface aerators SOTE (Standard Oxygen Transfer Efficiency) is higher thanks to better mixing capacity. This mixing capacity of an impeller depends highly on the impeller diameter. Low speed surface aerator present such high diameter. Therefore SOTE for low speed surface aerators is about 2 to 2.5 kg O2/kWh. This is why low speed surface aerators are mostly used in sewage or industrial treatment as WWTP are bigger and sparing energy (and money) becomes very interesting. Biological oxidation processes are sensitive to temperature and, between 0 °C and 40 °C, the rate of biological reactions increase with temperature. Most surface aerated vessels operate at between 4 °C and 32 °C. =Submerged diffused aeration= Submerged diffused air is essentially a form of a diffuser grid inside a lagoon. There are two main types of submerged diffused aeration systems for lagoon applications: floating lateral and submerged lateral. Both these systems utilize fine or medium bubble diffusers to provide aeration and mixing to the process water. The diffusers can be suspended slightly above the lagoon floor or may rest on the bottom. Flexible airline or weighted air hose supplies air to the diffuser unit from the air lateral (either floating or submerged).Floating Lateral Systems> See also * Industrial wastewater treatment * List of waste water treatment technologies * Retention basin * Rotating biological contactor * Sewage treatment * Waste stabilization pond * Water aeration * Water pollution ReferencesExternal links * Wastewater Lagoon Systems in Maine * Aerated, Partial Mix Lagoons (Wastewater Technology Fact Sheet by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency) * Aerated Lagoon Technology (Linvil G.

It is located on the Greater London border with Kent, bordering the Dartford Borough. It is located north west of Dartford. History Up until the Victorian era it was a hamlet a kilometre downstream of Crayford where no more than sixteen homes were clustered. A calico-printing works drew water power from the culverted River Wansunt in early Victorian times, being later adapted for the manufacture of rubber goods, then felt and finally Brussels carpets. This carpet mill was demolished by 1890 and Barnes Cray House, the next largest building, was cleared by 1933, ending its days as a nursing home. The remnants of the settlement became absorbed into Crayford with the building of a munition village to facilitate the expansion of Vickers' armaments factory during the 1915 to 1919 period. In 1920 the area became part of the Crayford Urban District of Kent (having previously been in Dartford Rural District). Following World War I Crayford Urban District Council erected further housing estates to the north, eventually merging with estates spreading southwards from Erith. In 1965, under the London Government Act 1963, the urban district was abolished and its area transferred to Greater London to form part of the present-day London Borough of Bexley.http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10025746&c;_id=10001043 visionofbritain.org.uk The Geoffrey Whitworth Theatre is in Barnes Cray.

Concept The term was used as early as 1973, when scientist Carl Sagan described it and other human chauvinisms that limit imagination of possible extraterrestrial life. It suggests that human beings, as carbon-based life forms who have never encountered any life that has evolved outside the Earth’s environment, may find it difficult to envision radically different biochemistries. In a 1999 Reason magazine article discussing the theory of a fine-tuned universe, Kenneth Silber quotes astrophysicist Victor J. Stenger using the term: Carbon alternatives Silicon in a diamond cubic crystal structure Like carbon, silicon can form four stable bonds with itself and other elements, and long chemical chains known as silane polymers, which are very similar to the hydrocarbons essential to life on Earth. Silicon is more reactive than carbon, which could make it optimal for extremely cold environments. However, silanes spontaneously burn in the presence of oxygen at relatively low temperatures, so an oxygen atmosphere may be deadly to silicon-based life. On the other hand, it is worth considering that alkanes are as a rule quite flammable, but carbon-based life on Earth does not store energy directly as alkanes, but as sugars, lipids, alcohols, and other hydrocarbon compounds with very different properties. Water as a solvent would also react with silanes, but again, this only matters if for some reason silanes are used or mass-produced by such organisms. Hydrocarbons and organic compounds are abundant in meteorites, comets, and interstellar clouds, while their silicon analogs have never been observed in nature. Silicon does, however, form complex one-, two- and three- dimensional polymers in which oxygen atoms form bridges between silicon atoms. These are termed silicates. They are both stable and abundant under terrestrial conditions, and have been proposed as a basis for a pre-organic form of evolution on Earth (see clay hypothesis).

The class represented an improvement on previous types, 1,000 tons displacement larger with better seaworthiness due to improved hull design. It also had somewhat increased firepower and superior arrangement of guns. Construction Ships of this category were designed for overseas duty where they were unlikely to encounter first class opposition. They were useful for showing the flag, suppressing piracy, escorting convoys during wartime, supporting colonial governments, and as a show of force to minor powers. They had some use in countering armed merchant cruisers of a hostile navy. Fox was sheathed in wood and copper, to fit her for tropical waters. The hull of an unsheathed steel vessel operating in warm waters would usually become so encrusted with barnacles that its speed would be seriously affected within six months.Copper sheathing, Globalsecurity.org Operational service Fox was commissioned at Portsmouth by Captain Frederick Sidney Pelham on 10 September 1901 to relieve HMS Marathon on the East Indies Station, and left home waters the following month after a commissioning trial in the Channel. She arrived at Malta on 28 October, at Aden on 11 November, and later proceeded to Bombay. In early January 1902 she sailed to Kuwait, carrying six small guns presented by the British to Sheikh Mubarak, after recent trouble between Britain and Turkey in the Persian Gulf. In September 1902 she was reported to be in Colombo, where she had escorted the SS Nithsdale after it had been involved in an accident near the Maldives, and later that month she was back at station head quarters in Trincomalee. In April 1904 Fox took part in the Somaliland Campaign, including supplying men for the landing party that stormed and captured the forts at Illig, the ship's guns supporting the attack.\\"The capture of the forts at Illig from the Mad Mullah, 21 April 1904\\", Paul G Lane. Orders & Medals Research Society Journal (Volume 59, number 2) June 2020. pp 152-156. She was paid off after six years in January 1907 and sent to the reserve fleet. In May 1908, she was recommissioned for the Home Fleet. In June 1908, she was sent once more to the East Indies where she served until 1914. On the outbreak of the First World War Fox was 18 years old and obsolete, but continued in active service. Off Colombo, Ceylon, she captured two German merchant ships, the Australia on 10 August 1914, and the Holtenfels on 11 August 1914. On 3 and 4 November, under Captain Francis Wade Caulfeild, Fox supported Indian and British troops in their unsuccessful attack on the port of Tanga in German East Africa on 3 and 4 November 1914. She then participated in the hunt for the German light cruiser SMS Königsberg and participated in a raid on Dar-es-Salaam where she bombarded the city. In January 1915 Fox was part of the force which occupied Mafia Island. Fox served in the East Indies and Egypt from 1915 to 1917, and then in the Red Sea in 1917 to 1918. Fox played a critical role while in the Red Sea in supporting the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire, flying the flag of William Boyle, 12th Earl of Cork. In 1919 Fox was dispatched to participate as part of the British intervention in the Russian Civil War. Scrapping The ship was sold in 1920 and scrapped in Watchet Harbour, Somerset by the Cardiff Scrap and Salvage company, in the autumn of 1923. She is still the largest vessel ever to enter Watchet Harbour.

Alachlor is an herbicide from the chloroacetanilide family. It is an odorless, white solid. The greatest use of alachlor is for control of annual grasses and broadleaf weeds in crops. Use of alachlor is illegal in the European Union and no products containing alachlor are currently registered in the United States. Its mode of action is elongase inhibition, and inhibition of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) cyclisation enzymes, part of the gibberellin pathway. It is marketed under the trade names Alanex, Bronco, Cannon, Crop Star, Intrro, Lariat, Lasso, Micro-Tech and Partner.Arnold P. Appleby, Franz Müller, Serge Carpy “Weed Control“ in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. Uses The largest use of alachlor is as a herbicide for control of annual grasses and broadleaf weeds in crops, primarily on corn, sorghum, and soybeans. =Application details= Alachlor mixes well with other herbicides. It is marketed in mixed formulations with atrazine, glyphosate, trifluralin and imazaquin. It is a selective, systemic herbicide, absorbed by germinating shoots and by roots. Its mode of action is elongase inhibition, and inhibition of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) cyclisation enzymes, part of the gibberellin pathway. Stated more simply, it works by interfering with a plant's ability to produce protein and by interfering with root growth.Cornell Herbicide Profile It is most commonly available as microgranules containing 15% active ingredients (AI), or emulsifiable concentrate containing 480 g/ litre of AI. Homologuation in Europe requires a maximum dose of 2,400 g per hectare of AI, or 5 litres/hectare of emulsifiable concentrate or 17 kg/ha of microgranules. The products are applied as either pre-drilling, soil incorporated or pre-emergence. Safety The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classifies the herbicide as toxicity class III - slightly toxic. The Maximum Contaminant Level Goal (MCLG) for Alachlor is zero, to prevent long-term effects. The Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) for drinking water is two parts per billion (2 ppb).US EPA Consumer Factsheet The EPA cited the following long-term effects for exposures at levels above the MCL in drinking water exposed to runoff from herbicide used on row crops: slight skin and eye irritation; at lifetime exposure to levels above the MCL: potential damage to liver, kidney, spleen; lining of nose and eyelids; cancer. The major source of environmental release of alachlor is through its manufacture and use as a herbicide. Alachlor was detected in rural domestic well water by EPA's National Survey of Pesticides in Drinking Water Wells. EPA's Pesticides in Ground Water Database reports detections of alachlor in ground water at concentrations above the MCL in at least 15 U.S. states. Alachlor is a controlled substance under Australian law and is listed as a Schedule 7 (Dangerous Poison) substance. Access, use and storage are strictly controlled under state and territory law. Since 2006, use of alachlor as a herbicide has been banned in the European Union. In \\"a judgment that could lend weight to other health claims against pesticides,\\" in January, 2012 a French court found Monsanto, which manufactures Lasso, liable for chemical poisoning of a French farmer in 2004. In 2015 a French appeals court upheld the ruling and ordered the company to \\"fully compensate\\" the grower. Environmental fate Alachlor exhibits moderate sorption in soil, ranging from 43-209 mL/g. Photodegradation is a minor contributor to alachlor fate. Degradation in soil appears to be largely biologically mediated, and produces multiple metabolites. The half life in aerobic soil ranges from about 6 to 15 days and is considerably shorter under anaerobic conditions.Vencill, W.K. 2002. WSSA herbicide handbook (8th edition). Weed Science Society of America. Lawrence, KS, USA. . One possible explanation for the short anaerobic half life is the observation that alachlor is rapidly transformed under anoxia to up to 14 degradation products in the presence of iron-bearing ferruginous smectites. The iron in such minerals can be used by certain soil bacteria as an electron acceptor when soils are flooded, thus the process of herbicide transformation by reduced clay is thought to be microbially mediated.Xu, J., J. W. Stucki, J. Wu, J. Kostka, and G. K. Sims. 2001. Fate of atrazine and alachlor in redox-treated ferruginous smectite. Environmental Toxicology & Chemistry 20: 2717-2724. Similar observations have been reported for the herbicides trifluralin and atrazine. Alachlor is often used in high school chemistry classrooms as a reactant in demonstrations such as the combustion of magnesium. Alachlor can be used as a substitution for methane gas in such an experiment when gas is not available.Kappa, Bromide 2013. Substitutions for methane gas in high school combustion demonstrations.

Many populations of Pterocarpus indicus are seriously threatened. It is extinct in Vietnam and possibly in Sri Lanka and Peninsular Malaysia. It was declared the national tree of the Philippines in 1934 by Governor-General Frank Murphy of the Insular Government of the Philippine Islands through Proclamation No. 652. Description Bark of Pterocarpus indicus in Kowloon, Hong Kong It is a large deciduous tree growing to 30–40 m tall, with a trunk up to 2 m diameter. The leaves are 12–22 cm long, pinnate, with 5–11 leaflets, the girth is 12–34 m wide. The flowers are produced in panicles 6–13 cm long containing a few to numerous flowers; flowering is from February to May in the Philippines, Borneo and the Malay peninsula. They are slightly fragrant and have yellow or orange-yellow petals. The fruit is a semiorbicular pod 2–3 cm diameter, surrounded by a flat 4–6 cm diameter membranaceous wing (wing-like structure) which aids dispersal by the wind. It contains one or two seeds, and does not split open at maturity; it ripens within 4–6 years, and becomes purple when dry. The central part of the pod can be smooth (f. indica), bristly (f. echinatus (Pers.) Rojo) or intermediate.Danida Seed Leaflet: Pterocarpus indicus (pdf file) Purdue University New Crops: Pterocarpus indicus Most Pterocarpus species prefer seasonal weather but P. indicus prefer rainforests. Note: Pterocarpus macrocarpus, a similar species native to Burma, is referred to as \\"Rosewood\\" throughout South East Asia. P. macrocarpus is usually harder than P. indicus. When in burl form both are referred to as Amboyna Burl. Uses The hardwood, which is purplish, is termite-resistant and rose-scented. The wood known in Indonesia as amboyna is the burl of the tree, named after Ambon, where much of this material was originally found. Often amboyna is finely sliced to produce an extremely decorative veneer, used for decoration and in making of furniture and keys on a marimba. It is a premium timber species suitable for high grade furniture, lumber and plywood for light construction purposes. It is also used for cartwheels, wood carving and musical instruments.Carandang, 2004 The flower is used as a honey source while leaf infusions are used as shampoos. Both flowers and leaves were said to be eaten. The leaves are supposedly good for waxing and polishing brass and copper. It is also a source of kino or resin. The leaves of narra are also used in traditional medicine to treat a variety of health problems. Narra leaves contain flavonoids. Flavonoids are antioxidants that provide health benefits to humans, such as anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic benefits. Flavonoids in narra leaves may be capable of preventing damage to your kidneys.Saputri et.al., 2007 In folk medicine, it is used to combat tumors. This property might be due to an acidic polypeptide found in its leaves that inhibited growth of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells by disruption of cell and nuclear membranes. It was also one of the sources of lignum nephriticum, a diuretic in Europe during the 16th to 18th centuries. Its reputation is due to its wood infusions, which are fluorescent. The tree is recommended as an ornamental tree for avenues and is sometimes planted in Puerto Rico as a shade and ornament. The tall, dome-shaped crown, with long, drooping branches is very attractive and the flowers are spectacular in areas with a dry season. It is very easily propagated from seed or large stem cuttings, but suffers from disease problems. It is widely planted as a roadside, park, and parking lot tree. In agroforestry, it maintains ecosystem fertility and soil stability. Narra is a leguminous plant that is capable of fixing nitrogen by forming endosymbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria that lives in its root nodules. Leguminous plants, such as narra, are responsible for transforming nitrogen into a usable form. In the Philippines, a permit is required to cut the tree (Nara), but nevertheless the popular sturdy wood is widely used for construction and furniture projects.

The Army of the Andes of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata led by General Captain José de San Martín defeated the Spanish force led by Rafael Maroto. It was a defeat for the Captaincy General of Chile, the royalist government established after the division of the Viceroyalty of Peru. Background In 1814, having been instrumental in the establishment of a popularly elected congress in Argentina, José de San Martín began to consider the problem of driving the Spanish royalists from South America entirely. He realized that the first step would be to expel them from Chile, and, to this end, he set about recruiting and equipping an army. In just under two years, he had an army of some 6,000 men, 1,200 horses and 22 cannons. On January 17, 1817, he set out with this force and began the crossing of the Andes. Careful planning on his part had meant that the royalist forces in Chile were deployed to meet threats that did not exist, and his crossing went unopposed. Nonetheless, the Army of the Andes (as San Martin's force was called) suffered heavy losses during the crossing, losing as much as one-third of its men and more than half of its horses. San Martin found himself allying with Chilean patriot Bernardo O'Higgins, who commanded his own army. The royalists rushed north in response to their approach, and a force of about 1,500 under Brigadier Rafael Maroto blocked San Martin's advance at a valley called Chacabuco, near Santiago. In the face of the disintegration of the royalist forces, Maroto proposed abandoning the capital and retreating southward, where they could hold out and obtain resources for a new campaign. The military conference called by Royal Governor Field Marshal Casimiro Marcó del Pont on February 8 adopted Maroto's strategy, but the following morning, the Captain General changed his mind and ordered Maroto to prepare for battle in Chacabuco. The night before the clash, Antonio de Quintanilla, who would later distinguish himself extraordinarily in the defense of Chiloé, confided to another Spanish official his opinion of the ill-chosen strategy: Given the position of the insurgents, the royalist forces ought to retreat a few leagues towards the hills of Colina. \\"Maroto overheard this conversation from a nearby chamber and either couldn't or refused to hear me because of his pride and self-importance, called on an attendant with his notorious hoarse voice and proclaimed a general decree on pain of death, to whoever suggested a retreat.\\" All Maroto and his troops had to do was delay San Martin, as he knew that further royalist reinforcements were on the way from Santiago. San Martin was well aware of this as well and opted to attack while he still had the numerical advantage. Prelude San Martín received numerous reports of the Spanish plans from a spy dressed as a roto, a poverty- stricken peasant of Chile. The roto told him that the Spanish general, Marcó, knew of fighting in the mountains and told his army to \\"run to the field\\", which refers to Chacabuco. He also told San Martín the plan of General Rafael Maroto, the leader of the Talavera Regiment and a force of volunteers of up to 2,000 men. His plan was to take the mountainside and launch an attack against San Martín.. On February 11, three days before his planned date of attack, San Martín called a war council to decide on a plan. Their main goal was to take the Chacabuco Ranch, the royalist headquarters, at the bottom of the hills. He decided to split his 2,000 troops into two parts, sending them down two roads on either side of the mountain. The right contingent was led by Miguel Estanislao Soler, and the left by O’Higgins. The plan was for Soler to attack their flanks, while at the same time surrounding their rear guard in order to prevent their retreat. San Martín expected that both leaders would attack at the same time, so the royalists would have to fight a battle on two fronts.. Battle San Martín sent his troops down the mountain starting at midnight of the 11th to prepare for an attack at dawn. At dawn, his troops were much closer to the royalists than anticipated, but fought hard and heroically. Meanwhile, Soler's troops had to go down a tiny path that proved long and arduous and took longer than expected. General O’Higgins, supposedly seeing his homeland and being overcome with passion, defied the plan of attack and charged, along with his 1,500. What exactly happened in this part of the battle is fiercely debated. O’Higgins claimed that the royalists stopped their retreat and started advancing towards his troops. He said that if he were to lead his men back up the narrow path and retreat, his men would have been decimated, one by one. San Martín saw O’Higgins premature advance and ordered Soler to charge the royalist flank, which took the pressure off O’Higgins and allowed his troops to hold their ground. The ensuing firefight lasted into the afternoon. The tide turned for the Army of the Andes as Soler captured a key royalist artillery point. At this point, the royalists set up a defensive square around the Chacabuco Ranch. O’Higgins charged the center of the royalist position, while Soler got into position behind the royalists, effectively cutting off any chance of retreat. O’Higgins and his men overwhelmed the royalist troops. When they attempted to retreat, Soler's men cut them off and pushed towards the ranch. Hand-to-hand combat ensued in and around the ranch until every royalist soldier was dead or taken captive. 500 royalist soldiers were killed and 600 taken prisoner. The Army of the Andes only lost twelve men in battle, but an additional 120 lost their lives from wounds suffered during the battle. Maroto succeeded in escaping, thanks to the speed of his horse, but was slightly injured.  Aftermath  The remaining royalist troops left Chile and retreated to Lima by ship. Interim governor Francisco Ruiz-Tagle presided at an assembly, which designated San Martín as governor, but he turned down the offer and requested a new assembly, which made O'Higgins Supreme Director of Chile. This marks the beginning of the \\"Patria Nueva\\" period in Chile's history.

The team was founded in 1994, and played at The Palace of Auburn Hills. Their mascot was a polar bear named Vipe-bear. Beginning The Vipers were originally the Salt Lake Golden Eagles. In 1994, the franchise was purchased by Palace Sports and Entertainment (owners of the Detroit Pistons and The Palace of Auburn Hills) and relocated for the 1994–95 season. A sponsorship deal with the Chrysler Corporation led to the naming of the team after their Dodge Viper, although the team's logo primarily featured a common Viperidae (a venomous snake). A similar deal was in place with another Palace Sports-owned team, the Detroit Neon of the Continental Indoor Soccer League, which would switch its sponsorship to GMC in its final year and rename the team the Detroit Safari after yet another vehicle, the Safari. The team hired former Buffalo Sabres coach Rick Dudley as head coach. Their first season was during the NHL lockout, and this, combined with a liberal amount of free ticket vouchers distributed at local stores, helped the Vipers break IHL attendance records that season with nearly 17,000 per game on average. On December 1, the Vipers took on the Ninety-Nines, an all-star team of locked-out NHL players led by Wayne Gretzky. The Vipers won, 4–3, with future NHL star Miroslav Satan scoring the winning goal for Detroit. (Three Detroit Red Wings players, Steve Yzerman, Sergei Fedorov, and Paul Coffey, did not appear in this game.) Led by a franchise-record 44 goals from Daniel Shank, the Vipers won the IHL's Central Division but were eliminated by the Kansas City Blades in five games in the first round of the playoffs. thumb The 1995–96 season would see the notable signing of Washington Capitals star Peter Bondra for a brief time, while he was locked in a holdout with Washington management, as well as the departure of Rick Dudley to take the general manager's position with the Ottawa Senators, replaced by assistant coach Steve Ludzik for the final 32 games. The Vipers would finish the season in second place in the Central Division and led the league in attendance again. In the first round of the playoffs, they defeated the Indianapolis Ice in five games, but the Vipers later lost their second round playoff series to the Orlando Solar Bears in seven games. The Turner Cup Finals 1996–97 saw the arrival of Russian phenom Sergei Samsonov and IHL All-Star Stan Drulia to the Vipers. Drulia led the team in scoring and Samsonov would win Rookie of the Year honors as the Vipers won another division title. Detroit would advance to their first Turner Cup Final, against the Long Beach Ice Dogs. Led by Samsonov and Peter Ciavaglia, the Vipers won the series four games to two for their first Turner Cup. That championship allowed the city of Detroit to be the first city to capture two cups in the same season as the Detroit Red Wings won the Stanley Cup. Samsonov would be a high first round draft pick of the Boston Bruins, but the slack was picked up in 1997–98 by 40 goals from Dan Kesa as the Vipers won their third division title in four years. They would advance to the Turner Cup Finals against the Chicago Wolves, but after going up three games to two, would only be able to score one goal in the final two games and lost four games to three. 1997–98 also saw a one-shift comeback from Gordie Howe, making him the only person to play hockey in six different decades as a professional. Front office and player personnel The Vipers were owned by William Davidson, a Detroit businessman with an estimated net worth of $3.5 billion with holdings under the banner of Palace Sports and Entertainment. Davidson holdings included the Detroit Pistons, the Detroit Neon, DTE Energy Music Theater, and the Palace of Auburn Hills (the Pistons and Vipers home arena). Davidson would later add or purchase the Detroit Fury, Detroit Shock, and the Tampa Bay Lightning. The CEO of Palace Sports and Entertainment, Tom Wilson, oversaw the daily business operations of the Vipers. The Vipers were aggressive in marketing and player acquisitions. The team acquired minor league free agents with prior success in the AHL/IHL, including Peter Ciavaglia, Stan Drulia, Lonnie Loach and Daniel Shank. The Vipers also made hockey headlines by signing star NHL players in the midst of contract holdouts, such as Peter Bondra and Michal Pivonka of the Washington Capitals in 1995–96, and Bryan Smolinski of the Pittsburgh Penguins in 1996–97. The Vipers also served as a launching site for young Eastern European players looking to adjust to the NHL-style game, which involved a slightly smaller rink and more aggressive play. These players included Petr Sykora, Stan Neckar, Miroslav Satan, Krysztof Oliwa and Sergei Samsonov. Samsonov in particular was a popular player who made his Vipers debut in 1996 at age 17, and was widely regarded as a phenom. He was drafted off the Vipers by the Boston Bruins following the season as the eighth pick of the first round of the 1997 NHL Entry Draft and would win the Calder Memorial Trophy as the NHL's best rookie in 1997–98. Veteran NHL players concluded their playing career with the Vipers, including Dan Quinn, Gerard Gallant, Brad Shaw, Brent Fedyk, Jimmy Carson, Michel Petit and Shawn Burr. The Vipers made headlines in 1997–98 by signing Hockey Hall of Fame winger Gordie Howe to a one-day contract. Howe, 69 years old at the time of the game, suited up for the Vipers and played one shift. The publicity stunt was intended to drum up interest in the club as well as afford Howe the opportunity to play a professional hockey game in six consecutive decades. In 1999, Davidson purchased the Tampa Bay Lightning of the National Hockey League. The Vipers were named as an affiliate of the Lightning and served as such until the league ceased operations in 2001. Demise The 1998–99 season saw another division title for the Vipers and they became the first team in professional hockey to have 100 points in the standings in each of their first five years. However, they were defeated in the Eastern Conference Finals by the Solar Bears in seven games, after a questionable call by referee Matt Pilgrim. In 1999, Palace Sports and Entertainment purchased the Tampa Bay Lightning and made the Detroit Vipers their top farm club. Vipers coach Steve Ludzik was moved to Tampa Bay as part of Palace's effort to rebuild the struggling NHL club. Paulin Bordeleau took over as Vipers coach. The Lightning remained barely competitive, prompting a mass transfer of talent from Detroit to Tampa throughout the season. This drained the Vipers of the strength and stability that they had experienced through the first five years of their existence. It also led to a swift, sudden and near-total collapse; the Vipers plummeted from the second-best record a year earlier to dead last in the league. The Vipers' woes were nothing, however, compared to the worsening health of the IHL. The league had overexpanded itself throughout the decade, and was paying the price in red ink. Additionally, strained relations with the NHL cost a number of IHL teams their NHL affiliations–and with it, their subsidized salaries. By the start of the 2000-01 season, the Vipers were one of only four IHL teams affiliated with NHL teams. That season saw the Vipers finish dead last in the league in standings and attendance. The impending demise of the IHL, combined with the plummeting attendance led Palace Sports to find a new affiliate for the Lightning. On June 4, 2001, both the International Hockey League and the Detroit Vipers ceased operations.

Country Day Schools seek to recreate the educational rigor, atmosphere, camaraderie and character- building aspects of the best college prep boarding schools while allowing students to return to their families at the end of the day. To avoid the crime, pollution and health problems of the industrial cities of the early 20th century, the schools were sited in the 'country,' where wealthy families owned large homes in what would later be known as suburbs. The Country Day School movement shared many values with the Arts and Crafts movement. School buildings and campus landscaping were designed with the goal of creating an inspirational atmosphere that would foster learning and culture. In keeping with this holistic view of the student learning environment, various \\"after- school\\" programs promoted student development, including athletic programs, choir and religious studies, and monitored study time. Students were given opportunities to develop leadership skills through clubs and student organizations. The first Country Day Schools were Poly Prep Country Day School, University School (near Cleveland), Detroit Country Day School, The Gilman School, The Summit Country Day School, and The McDonogh School. These six college preparatory schools provided the structure and campus location format that would guide many more country day schools that would be built around the country for the next 100 years. A leader in the movement, Tower Hill School was founded by the du Pont family in Wilmington, DE, headed by Burton Fowler, a devout follower of John Dewey and President of the Progressive Education Association.Forever Green, A Commemorative History of Tower Hill School, Wilmington, DE, 1994, 13-70.

It is a form of quantitative analysis. Background A solution containing the analyte, A, in the presence of some conductive buffer. If an electrolytic potential is applied to the solution through a working electrode, then the measured current depends (in part) on the concentration of the analyte. Measurement of this current can be used to determine the concentration of the analyte directly; this is a form of amperometry. However, the difficulty is that the measured current depends on several other variables, and it is not always possible to control all of them adequately. This limits the precision of direct amperometry. If the potential applied to the working electrode is sufficient to reduce the analyte, then the concentration of analyte close to the working electrode will decrease. More of the analyte will slowly diffuse into the volume of solution close to the working electrode, restoring the concentration. If the potential applied to the working electrode is great enough (an overpotential), then the concentration of analyte next to the working electrode will depend entirely on the rate of diffusion. In such a case, the current is said to be diffusion limited. As the analyte is reduced at the working electrode, the concentration of the analyte in the whole solution will very slowly decrease; this depends on the size of the working electrode compared to the volume of the solution. What happens if some other species which reacts with the analyte (the titrant) is added? (For instance, chromate ions can be added to oxidize lead ions.) After a small quantity of the titrant (chromate) is added, the concentration of the analyte (lead) has decreased due to the reaction with chromate. The current from the reduction of lead ion at the working electrode will decrease. The addition is repeated, and the current decreases again. A plot of the current against volume of added titrant will be a straight line. After enough titrant has been added to react completely with the analyte, the excess titrant may itself be reduced at the working electrode. Since this is a different species with different diffusion characteristics (and different half-reaction), the slope of current versus added titrant will have a different slope after the equivalence point. This change in slope marks the equivalence point, in the same way that, for instance, the sudden change in pH marks the equivalence point in an acid-base titration. The electrode potential may also be chosen such that the titrant is reduced, but the analyte is not. In this case, the presence of excess titrant is easily detected by the increase in current above background (charging) current. Advantages The chief advantage over direct amperometry is that the magnitude of the measured current is of interest only as an indicator. Thus, factors that are of critical importance to quantitative amperometry, such as the surface area of the working electrode, completely disappear from amperometric titrations. The chief advantage over other types of titration is the selectivity offered by the electrode potential, as well as by the choice of titrant. For instance, lead ion is reduced at a potential of -0.60 V (relative to the saturated calomel electrode), while zinc ions are not; this allows the determination of lead in the presence of zinc. Clearly this advantage depends entirely on the other species present in the sample.

Some of the best-known genres of American music are blues, jazz, rock and roll, rock, hip hop, house, and country. The history began with the Native Americans, the first people to populate North America. The music of these people was highly varied in form, and was mostly religious in purpose. With the colonization of America from European countries like France, Spain, Scotland, England, Ireland, and Wales came Christian choirs, musical notation, broadsides, as well as West African slaves. West African slaves played a variety of instruments, especially drums and string instruments similar to the banjo. The Spanish also played a similar instrument called the Bandora. Both of these cultures introduced polyrhythms and call-and-response style vocals. As the United States incorporated more land, spreading west towards the Ocean, more immigrants began to arrive in the country, bringing with them their own instruments and styles. During this time, the United States grew to incorporate the Cajun and Creole music of Louisiana, the Polynesian music of Hawaii and Tex-Mex and Tejano music. Immigrants brought with them the Eastern European polka, Chinese and Japanese music, and Polish fiddling, Scottish and Irish music, Ashkenazi Jewish klezmer, and other styles of Indian, Russian, French, German, Italian, Arab and Latin music. In the 21st century, American popular music achieved great international acclaim. Even since the ragtime and minstrel songs of the 19th century, African Americans have greatly influenced American popular music. The rural blues of poor black Southerners and the jazz of black urbanites were among the earliest styles of American popular music. At the time, black performers typically did not perform their own material, instead using songs produced by the music publishing companies of Tin Pan Alley. African American blues evolved during the early 20th century, later evolving to create genres like rhythm and blues. During this time, jazz diversified into steadily more experimental fields. By the end of the 1940s, jazz had grown into such varied fields as bebop and jazz. Rock and roll was soon to become the most important component of American popular music, beginning with the rockabilly boom of the 1950s. In the following decade, gospel evolved into secular soul. Rock, country and soul, mixed with each other and occasionally other styles, spawned a legion of subgenres over the next few decades, ranging from heavy metal to punk and funk. In the 1970s, urban African Americans in New York City began performing spoken lyrics over a beat provided by an emcee; this became known as hip hop music. By the dawn of the 21st century, hip hop had become a part of most recorded American popular music, and by the 2010s had surpassed rock music in overall listenership. American roots music Benjamin Carr by John Sartain after John Clarendon Darley The first musicians anywhere in North America were Native Americans, who consist of hundreds of ethnic groups across the country, each with their own unique styles of folk music. Of these cultures, many, and their musical traditions, are now extinct, though some remain relatively vibrant in a modern form, such as Hawaiian music. By the 16th century, large-scale immigration of English, French and Spanish settlers brought new kinds of folk music. This was followed by the importation of Africans as slaves, bringing their music with them. The Africans were as culturally varied as the Native Americans, descended from hundreds of ethnic groups in West Africa. American music is, like most of its hemispheric neighbors, a mixture of African, European and a little bit of native influences. Still later in the country's history, ethnic and musical diversity grew as the United States grew into a melting pot of different peoples. Immigration from China began in large numbers in the 19th century, most of them settling on the West Coast. Later, Japanese, Indian, Scottish, Polish, Italian, Irish, Mexican, Swedish, Ukrainian and Armenian immigrants also arrived in large numbers. The first song copyrighted under the new United States Constitution was The Kentucky Volunteer, composed by a recent immigrant from England, Raynor Taylor, one of the first notable composers active in the US, and printed by the most prolific and notable musical publisher of the country's first decade, Benjamin Carr. =African American music= Clay Center, about 1910. In the 19th century, African- Americans were freed from slavery following the American Civil War. Their music was a mixture of Scottish and African origin, like African American gospel displaying polyrhythm and other distinctly African traits. Work songs and field hollers were popular, but it was spirituals which became a major foundation for music in the 20th century. Spirituals (or Negro spirituals, as they were then known) were Christian songs, dominated by passionate and earthy vocals similar to the church music of Scotland, which were performed in an African-style and Scottish style call-and-response format using hymns derived from those sung in colonial New England choirs, which were based on Moravian, English and Dutch church music. These hymns spread south through Appalachia in the late 18th century, where they were partnered with the music of the African slaves. During the Great Awakening of religious fervor in the early 19th century, spirituals spread across the south. Among some whites, slave music grew increasingly popular, especially after the American Civil War, when black and white soldiers worked together and Southern slaves fled north in huge numbers. By the end of the 19th century, minstrel shows had spread across the country, and even to continental Europe. In minstrel shows, performers imitated slaves in crude caricatures, singing and dancing to what was called \\"Negro music\\", though it had little in common with authentic African American folk styles. An African American variety of dance music called the cakewalk also became popular, evolving into ragtime by the start of the 20th century. =Appalachian folk music= The Appalachian Mountains run along the East Coast of the United States. The region has long been historically poor compared to much of the rest of the country; many of the rural Appalachian people travelled to cities for work, and were there labeled hillbillies, and their music became known as hillbilly music. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Irish and Scottish immigrants arrived in large numbers. They mingled there with poor whites of other ethnic backgrounds, as well as many blacks. The result was a diverse array of folk styles which have been collectively referred to as Appalachian folk music. These styles included jug bands, honky tonk and bluegrass, and are the root of modern country music. Appalachian folk music began its evolution towards pop-country in 1927, when Jimmie Rodgers and the Carter Family began recording in a historic session with Ralph Peer (Barraclough and Wolff, 537). Rodgers sang often morbid lyrical themes that drew on the blues to create tales of the poor and unlucky (Collins, 11), while the Carters preferred more upbeat ballads with clear vocals, complementary instrumentation and wholesome lyrics (Garofalo, 53). Their success paved the way for the development of popular country, and left its mark on the developing genre of rock and roll. =Other forms of American roots music= Pow Wow in Helena, Montana. Though Appalachian and African American folk music became the basis for most of American popular music, the United States is home to a diverse assortment of ethnic groups. In the early 20th century, many of these ethnic groups supported niche record industries and produced minor folk stars like Pawlo Humeniuk, the \\"King of the Ukrainian Fiddlers\\" (Kochan and Kytasty, 308). Some of these ethnic musicians eventually became well-known across the country, such as Frankie Yankovic, the Slovenian polka master. This same period also saw the rise of Native American powwows around the start of the 20th century. These were large-scale intertribal events featuring spiritual activity and musical performances, mostly group percussion based (Means, 594). Large-scale immigration of Eastern European Jews and their klezmer music peaked in the first few decades of the 20th century. People like Harry Kandel and Dave Tarras become stars within their niche, and made the United States the international center for klezmer (Broughton, 583). In Texas, ethnic Mexicans who had lived in the area for centuries, played a distinct style of conjunto, different from that played in Mexico. The influence of Czech polka music was a major distinguishing characteristic of this music, which gradually evolved into what is now known as norteño (Burr, 604). The Cajuns and Creoles of Louisiana have long constituted a distinct minority with their own cultural identity. The Cajuns are descendants of French-Canadians from the region of Acadia, the Creoles are black and French-speaking. Their music was a mixture of bluesy work songs mixed with jazz and other influences, and included styles like la la and juré. Though these genres were geographically limited, they were modernized and mixed with more mainstream styles, evolving into popular zydeco music by the middle of the century (Broughton and Kaliss, 558). Beginnings of Popular music The first field of American music that could be viewed as popular, rather than classical or folk, was the singing of the colonial New England choirs, and travelling singing masters like William Billings. It was here that techniques and traditions like shape note, lined-out hymnody and Sacred Harp were created, gradually spreading south and becoming an integral part of the Great Awakening. The Great Awakening of the 1730s and ’40s was a period of religious fervor, among whites and blacks (both slave and free), that saw passionate, evangelical \\"Negro spirituals\\" grow in popularity (Ferris, 98). John Philips Sousa During the 19th century, it was not spirituals that gained truly widespread acclaim, but rather peppy comic songs performed by minstrels in blackface, and written by legendary songwriters like Stephen Foster and Daniel Emmett. During the Civil War, popular ballads were common, some used liberally by both the North and the South as patriotic songs. Finally, late in the century, the African American cakewalk evolved into ragtime, which became a North American and European sensation, while mainstream America was enthralled by the brass band marches of John Philips Sousa. Mamie Smith, performed in various styles, including jazz and blues. Tin Pan Alley was the biggest source of popular music early in the 20th century (Garofolo, 17). Tin Pan Alley was a place in New York City which published sheet music for dance songs like \\"After the Ball Is Over\\". The first few decades of the 20th century also saw the rise of popular, comic musical theater, such as the vaudeville tradition and composers and writers like Oscar Hammerstein II, Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin. At the same time, jazz and blues, two distinct but related genres, began flourishing in cities like Memphis, Chicago and New Orleans and began to attract some mainstream audiences. Blues and jazz were the foundation of what became American popular music. The ability to sell recorded music through phonographs changed the music industry into one that relied on the charisma of star performers rather than songwriters. There was increased pressure to record bigger hits, meaning that even minor trends and fads like Hawaiian steel guitar left a permanent influence (the steel guitar is still very common in country music). Dominican merengue and Argentinian tango also left their mark, especially on jazz, which has long been a part of the music scene in Latin America. During the 1920s, classic female blues singers like Mamie Smith became the first musical celebrities of national renown. Gospel, blues and jazz were also diversifying during this period, with new subgenres evolving in different cities like Memphis, New York, New Orleans and Chicago. Jazz quickly replaced the blues as American popular music, in the form of big band swing, a kind of dance music from the early 1930s. Swing used large ensembles, and was not generally improvised, in contrast with the free-flowing form of other kinds of jazz. With swing spreading across the nation, other genres continued to evolve towards popular traditions. In Louisiana, Cajun and Creole music was adding influences from blues and generating some regional hit records, while Appalachian folk music was spawning jug bands, honky tonk bars and close harmony duets, which were to evolve into the pop-folk of the 1940s, bluegrass and country. The American Popular music reflects and defines American Society. 1940s and 1950s In the 1940s, jazz evolved into an ever more experimental bebop scene. Country and folk music further developed as well, gaining newfound popularity and acclaim for hard-edged folk music. =The dawn of rock & roll= Bill Haley and His Comets had the biggest selling rock and roll single in the history of the genre. Starting in the 1920s, Boogie Woogie began to evolve into what would become rock and roll, with decided blues influences, from 1929's \\"Crazy About My Baby\\" with fundamental rock elements to 1938's \\"Roll 'Em Pete\\" by Big Joe Turner, which contained almost the complete formula. Teenagers from across the country began to identify with each other and launched numerous trends. Perhaps most importantly, the 1940s saw the rise of the youth culture. The first teen stars arose, beginning with the bobby soxer idol Frank Sinatra; this opened up new audiences for popular music, which had been primarily an adult phenomenon prior to the 1940s. In the 1940s, boogie woogie was using terms like \\"rocking\\" and \\"rolling\\" borrowed from gospel and blues music, as in \\"Good Rockin' Tonight\\" by Roy Brown. In the 1950s, rock and roll musicians began producing direct covers of boogie woogie and R&B; stars, for example \\"Shake Rattle and Roll\\" by Big Joe Turner (covered by Bill Haley and his Comets in 1954) and \\"Hound Dog\\" by Big Mama Thornton (covered by Elvis Presley in 1956), and their own original works like Chuck Berry's \\"Maybellene\\" in 1955. =Roots of country music= Willie Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music The early 1940s saw the first major commercial success for Appalachian folk. Singers like Pete Seeger emerged, in groups like the Almanac Singers and The Weavers. Show 1. Lyrically, these performers drew on early singer- songwriters like Woody Guthrie, and the whole scene became gradually associated with the political left (Garofolo, 196). By the 1950s, the anti- Communism scare was in full swing, and some performers with a liberal or socialist bent were blacklisted from the music industry. In the middle of the 1940s, Western swing reached its peak of popularity. It was a mixture of diverse influences, including swing, blues, polka and popular cowboy songs, and included early stars like Bob Wills, who became among the best known musicians of the era. With a honky tonk root, modern country music arose in the 1940s, mixing with R&B; and the blues to form rockabilly. Rockabilly's earliest stars were Elvis Presley and Bill Haley, who entertained to crowds of devoted teenage fans. At the time, black audiences were listening to R&B;, doo wop and gospel, but these styles were not perceived as appropriate for white listeners. People like Haley and Presley were white, but sang in a black style. This caused a great deal of cheeze controversy from concerned parents who felt that \\"race music\\", as it was then known, would corrupt their children. Nevertheless, rockabilly's popularity continued to grow, paving the way for the earliest rock stars like Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Little Richard and Fats Domino. Among country fans, rockabilly was not well-regarded. Instead, the pop sounds of singers like Hank Williams and Patsy Cline became popular. Williams had an unprecedented run of success, with more than ten chart-topping singles in two years (1950–1951), including well-remembered songs still performed today like \\"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\\" and \\"Cold, Cold Heart\\". It was performers like Williams that established the city of Nashville, Tennessee as the center of the country music industry. There, country and pop were mixed, resulting in what was known as the Nashville Sound. =Gospel and doo wop= Mahalia Jackson is known as the \\"Queen of Gospel\\". The 1950s also saw the widespread popularization of gospel music, in the form of powerful singers like Mahalia Jackson. Gospel first broke into international audiences in 1948, with the release of Jackson's \\"Move on Up a Little Higher\\", which was so popular it couldn't be shipped to record stores fast enough. As the music became more mainstream in the later part of the decade, performers began adding influences from R&B; to make a more palatable and dance-able sound. Early in the next decade, the lyrics were secularized, resulting in soul music. Some of soul's biggest stars began performing in the 1950s gospel scene, including Sam Cooke, Dinah Washington, Dionne Warwick and Aretha Franklin. Doo wop, a complex type of vocal music, also became popular during the 1950s, and left its mark on 1960s soul and R&B.; The genre's exact origins are debatable, but it drew on groups like the Mills Brothers and The Ink Spots, who played a kind of R&B; with smooth, alternating lead vocals. With the addition of gospel inflections, doo wop's polished sound and romantic ballads made it a major part of the 1950s music scene, beginning in 1951. The first popular groups were The Five Keys (\\"Glory Of Love\\") and The Flamingos (\\"Golden Teardrops\\"). Doo wop diversified considerably later in the decade, with groups like The Crows (\\"Gee\\"), creating a style of uptempo doo wop and the ballad style via The Penguins (\\"Earth Angel\\"), while singers like Frankie Lymon became sensations; Lymon became the first black teen idol in the country's history after the release of the Top 40 pop hit \\"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\\" (1956). =Latin music= Linda Ronstadt was awarded the Latin Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award by The Latin Recording Academy in 2011. Latin music imported from Cuba (chachachá, mambo, rumba) and Mexico (ranchera and mariachi) had brief periods of popularity during the 1950s. The earliest popular Latin music in the United States came with rumba in the early 1930s, and was followed by calypso in the mid-40s, mambo in the late 1940s and early 1950s, chachachá and charanga in the mid-50s, bolero in the late 1950s and finally boogaloo in the mid-60s, while Latin music mixed with jazz during the same period, resulting in Latin jazz and the bossa nova fusion cool jazz. The first Mexican-Texan pop star was Lydia Mendoza, who began recording in 1934. It was not until the 1940s, however, that musica norteña became popularized by female duets like Carmen y Laura and Las Hermanas Mendoza, who had a string of regional hits. The following decade saw the rise of Chelo Silva, known as the \\"Queen of the (Mexican) Bolero\\", who sang romantic pop songs. The 1950s saw further innovation in the Mexican-Texan community, as electric guitars, drums and elements of rock and jazz were added to conjunto. Valeria Longoria was the first major performer of conjunto, known for introducing Colombian cumbia and Mexican ranchera to conjunto bands. Later, Tony de la Rosa modernized the conjunto big bands by adding electric guitars, amplified bajo sexto and a drum kit and slowing down the frenetic dance rhythms of the style. In the mid-1950s, bandleader Isidro Lopez used accordion in his band, thus beginning the evolution of Tejano music. The rock-influenced Little Joe was the first major star of this scene. =Cajun and Creole music= Louisiana's Cajun and Creole communities saw their local music become a brief mainstream fad during the 1950s. This was largely due to the work of Clifton Chenier, who began recording for Speciality Records in 1955. He took authentic Cajun and Creole music and added more elements of rock and roll: a rollicking beat, frenetic vocals and a dance-able rhythm; the result was a style called zydeco. Chenier continued recording for more than thirty years, releasing over a hundred albums and paving the way for later stars like Boozoo Chavis and Buckwheat Zydeco. 1960s and 70s Bob Dylan performing in 2011. In the 1960s, music became heavily involved in the burgeoning youth counter culture, as well as various social and political causes. The beginning of the decade saw the peak of doo wop's popularity, in about 1961, as well as the rise of surf, girl groups and the first soul singers. Psychedelic and progressive rock arose during this period, along with the roots of what would later become funk, hip hop, salsa, electronic music, punk rock and heavy metal. An American roots revival occurred simultaneously as a period of sexual liberation and racial conflict, leading to growth in the lyrical maturity and complexity of popular music as songwriters wrote about the changes the country was going through. =Early 1960s= The first few years of the 1960s saw major innovation in popular music. Girl groups, surf and hot rod, and the Nashville Sound were popular, while an Appalachian folk and African American blues roots revival became dominant among a smaller portion of the listening audience. An even larger population of young audiences in the United Kingdom listened to American blues. By the middle of the decade, British blues and R&B; bands like The Beatles, The Who and the Rolling Stones were topping the charts in what became known as the British Invasion, alongside newly secularized soul music and the mainstreaming of the Bakersfield Sound. Folk-based singer-songwriters like Bob Dylan also added new innovations to popular music, expanding its possibilities, such as by making singles more than the standard three minutes in length. =Psychedelic rock= Jefferson Airplane band. Psychedelic rock became the genre most closely intertwined with the youth culture. It arose from the British Invasion of blues in the middle of the decade, when bands like The Beatles, Rolling Stones and The Who dominated the charts and only a few American bands, such as The Beach Boys and The Mamas & the Papas, could compete. It became associated with hippies and the anti-war movement, civil rights, feminism and environmentalism, paralleling the similar rise of Afrocentric Black Power in soul and funk. Events like Woodstock became defining symbols for the generation known as the Baby Boomers, who were born immediately following World War 2 and came of age in the mid to late 1960s. Later in the decade, psychedelic rock and the youth culture splintered. Punk rock, heavy metal, singer-songwriter and progressive rock appeared, and the connection between music and social activism largely disappeared from popular music. =Soul and funk= From 1960s to 1970s, female soul singers like Aretha Franklin, and female pop singer Dionne Warwick and Diana Ross were popular, while innovative performers like James Brown invented a new style of soul called funk. Influenced by psychedelic rock, which was on the charts at the time, funk was a very rhythmic, dance-able kind of soul. Later in the decade and into the 1970s, funk too split into two strands. Sly & the Family Stone made pop-funk palatable for the masses, while George Clinton and his P Funk collective pioneered a new, psychedelic funk. In 1970s Kool & the Gang and the Ohio Players were popular. Album-oriented soul also appeared very late in the decade and into the next, with artists like Marvin Gaye, Al Green and Curtis Mayfield taking soul beyond the realm of the single into cohesive album-length artistic statements with a complex social conscience. It was in this context, of album-oriented soul and funk, influenced by Black Power and the civil rights movement, that African Americans in Harlem invented hip hop music. =Country and folk= Garth Brooks performs. Merle Haggard led the rise of the Bakersfield Sound in the 1960s, when the perceived superficiality of the Nashville Sound led to a national wave that almost entirely switched country music's capital and sound within the space of a few years. At the same time, bluegrass became a major influence on jam bands like Grateful Dead and also evolved into new, progressive genres like newgrass. As part of the nationwide roots revival, Hawaiian slack-key guitar and Cajun swamp pop also saw mainstream success. =Tejano= With the widespread success of Tony de la Rosa's big band conjunto in the late 1950s, the style became more influenced by rock and pop. Esteban Jordan's wild, improvised style of accordion became popular, paving the way for the further success of El Conjunto Bernal. The Bernal brothers' band sold thousands of albums and used faster rhythms than before. 1970s The early 1970s saw popular music being dominated by folk- based singer-songwriters like John Denver, Carole King and James Taylor, followed by the rise of heavy metal subgenres, glam, country rock and later, disco. Philly soul and pop-funk was also popular, while world music fusions became more commonplace and a major klezmer revival occurred among the Jewish community. Beginning in the early 1970s, hip hop arose in New York City, drawing on diverse influences from both white and black folk music, Jamaican toasting and the performance poetry of Gil Scott-Heron. =Heavy metal= Alice in chains Heavy metal's early pioneers included the British bands Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, though American cult bands Blue Cheer and The Velvet Underground also played a major role. Their music was hard-edged and bluesy, with an often menacing tone that became more pronounced in later subgenres. In the beginning of the 1970s, heavy metal-influenced glam rock arose, and musicians like David Bowie became famous for gender-bending costumes and themes. Glam was followed by mainstream bombastic arena rock and light progressive rock bands becoming mainstream, with bands like Styx and Chicago launching popular careers that lasted most of the decade. Glam metal, a glitzy form of Los Angeles metal, also found a niche audience but limited mainstream success. =Outlaw country= With the Bakersfield Sound the dominant influence, outlaw country singers like Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings were the biggest country stars of the 1970s, alongside country rock bands like Lynyrd Skynyrd and Allman Brothers Band who were more oriented towards crossover audiences. Later in the decade and into the next, these both mixed with other genres in the form of heartland rockers like Bruce Springsteen, while a honky tonk revival hit the country charts, led by Dwight Yoakam. =Hip hop= Kool DJ Herc credited with helping originate hip hop music in the Bronx, New York City, in the 1970s. Hip hop was a cultural movement that began in Bronx in the early 1970s, consisting of four elements. Two of them, rapping and DJing, make up hip hop music. These two elements were imported from Jamaica by DJ Kool Herc. At neighborhood block parties, DJs would spin popular records while the audience danced. Soon, an MC arose to lead the proceedings, as the DJ began isolating and repeating the percussion breaks (the most popular, dance-able part). MCs' introductions became more and more complex, drawing on numerous African-derived vocal traditions, and became the foundation of rapping. By the end of the decade, hip hop had spread across the country, especially in Los Angeles and Chicago. =Salsa= Cuban and Puerto Ricans in New York invented salsa in the early 1970s, using multiple sources from Latin America in the pan-Latin melting pot of the city. Puerto Rican plena and bomba and Cuban chachacha, son montuno and mambo were the biggest influences, alongside Jamaican, Mexican, Dominican, Trinidadian, Argentinian, Colombian and Brazilian sources. Many of the earliest salsa musicians, like Tito Puente, had had a long career in various styles of Latin music. Salsa grew very popular in the 1970s and into the next two decades, spreading south to Venezuela, Colombia, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Peru and especially Cuba. =Punk rock= Punk rock arose as a reaction against what had come before. Early punks believed that hollow greed had destroyed American music, and hated the perceived bombasity and arrogance of the biggest bands of the 1970s. It arose in London and New York, with numerous regional centers by the end of the decade when acts like Ramones and Patti Smith saw unprecedented success for their defiantly anti-mainstream genre. It was the British band The Clash, however, that became wildly popular, more so in the UK than the U.S., and set the stage for adoption of elements of punk in popular music in the 1980s. 1980s and 90s LL Cool J with the breakthrough success of his hit single \\"I Need a Beat\\" and the Radio LP, LL Cool J became an early hip-hop act. The 1980s began with new wave dominating the charts, and continued through a new form of silky smooth soul, and ended with a popular glam metal trend dominating mainstream America. Meanwhile, the first glimmer of punk rock's popularity began, and new alternative rock and hardcore found niche markets. Hip hop diversified as a few artists gained mainstream success, finally breaking through in the last few months of the decade. =Hip hop= In the 1980s, hip hop saw its first taste of mainstream success with LL Cool J and Kurtis Blow. Meanwhile, hip hop was continuing its spread from the East Coast to most major urban areas across the country, and abroad. At the end of the decade, two albums broke the genre into the mainstream. Public Enemy's It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back and N.W.A's Straight Outta Compton broke through with highly controversial and sometimes violent lyrics. N.W.A proved especially important, launching the career of Dr. Dre and the dominant West Coast rap sound of the next decade. That same year (1989), De La Soul's 3 Feet High and Rising became the earliest release of alternative hip hop, and numerous regional styles of hip hop saw their first legitimization, including Chicago hip house, Los Angeles electroclash, Miami's bass, Washington, D.C.'s go-go and Detroit's ghettotech. Drawing inspiration from the rebellious attitudes of the Civil Rights Movement and groups like Public Enemy, many intelligent and politically minded rappers began what is known as underground hip-hop with artists like Boots Riley from The Coup leading the way. =1990s= Pearl Jam As the 1990s began, hair metal was dominating the charts, especially formulaic bands like Extreme. In reaction to that, the first few years saw a sea change in American popular music. Nirvana's Nevermind along with Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden launched the defiantly anti-mainstream grunge movement among mainstream audiences, while Dr. Dre's The Chronic brought his West Coast G Funk sound to widespread success. Both these trends died out quickly, however, grunge done in by Kurt Cobain's death and disillusionisment with grunge, a form of alternative rock, becoming mainstream. G Funk lasted a few years, displacing East Coast rap as the dominant sound of hip hop. A rivalry began, fed by the music news, focusing on West Coast's Tupac Shakur and the East Coast's Notorious B.I.G.. By the middle of the decade, Tupac and Biggie were shot dead, and Dr. Dre's Death Row Records had fallen apart. East Coast rappers like Puff Daddy, 50 Cent and Busta Rhymes re-established the East Coast, while Atlanta's OutKast and other performers found a mainstream audience. Alanis Morissette, one of the top-selling artist of the 1990s, injected renewed popularity to singer- songwriters such as Tori Amos, Jewel, and Sarah McLachlan. In the wake of grunge and gangsta rap came a fusion of soul and hip hop, called neo soul, some popularity for British Britpop and the rise of bands like Sublime and No Doubt, playing a form of pop punk influenced by Jamaican ska and British two tone ska/punk fusionists from the early 1980s. Techno also became popular, though nowhere's near as much so as in most of the rest of the world. At the turn of the millennium, bubblegum pop groups like Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears were dominating the charts, many of them with a Latin beat (Shakira, Ricky Martin), and rappers like Jay-Z and Eminem were huge stars. Some garage rock revivalists like The White Stripes and The Hives became highly hyped bands in the indie rock field, and achieved substantial mainstream success. The first few years of the 2000s saw the further rise of pop-hip hop, fed by the breakthrough success of Eminem. Indeed, hip hop became an essential element of nearly all popular music during this period, resulting in new fusions like nu metal. Pop thug rappers like Ja Rule were nationally renowned, though hard-edged hip made a return within a few years with the rise of 50 Cent. Politically minded hip hop in the tradition of Public Enemy and Boogie Down Productions has also diversified since the early 1990s with groups like The Coup, Sweatshop Union, Mr. Lif, Paris, Immortal Technique and many others.

The stories are set in an alternate 14th century, where Islam never existed and the great ancient empires of Byzantium (the Eastern Roman Empire) and Sassanid Persia survive. Setting The world of the Agent of Byzantium series. In this universe, the point of divergence occurs when the Prophet Muhammad (Mouamet), instead of developing Islam, converted to Christianity and became a celebrated prelate and saint. Without the Muslim conquests, the Eastern Roman Empire remained the pre-eminent power in the Mediterranean world. The Emperor Constans II subdued the Lombards in Italy, and the Iberian peninsula (Ispania) and the southern coast of Gaul were also recovered. Most of Gaul, Britain and Germania are in \\"barbarian\\" hands, and have broken away from Byzantine orthodoxy, following the doctrine of filioque and a separate line of Popes. In the East, the Byzantines are still—as it was in our history up to the advent of Islam—involved in a never-ending cold war (occasionally flaring up into actual fighting) with its Persian arch-enemy, represented in the series by the female spy Mirrane. Argyros works as an army scout, and later as a magistrianos for the Master of Offices, under the (fictional) Emperor Nikephoros III, and as such is sent across the Empire to solve problems — sometimes as a spy, sometimes as a negotiator, and sometimes as a soldier.

The 127th episode overall, it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on March 16, 2005. In the episode, Cartman works to rid South Park from an infestation of hippies. The episode parodies the 2003 film The Core. Plot Cartman runs a 'pest control' service to rid the town of hippies. Having studied hippies in his quest to eradicate them, Cartman deduces the hippies are about to start a music festival in South Park, but his attempts to warn the town council are futile, and he is arrested soon afterwards for imprisoning 63 hippies in his basement. The town of South Park is soon invaded by the largest population of hippies in history, and the music festival threatens to destroy the town. They manage to convert Stan, Kyle and Kenny to their cause with talks of corporate evils, and the trio get caught up in the massive hippie crowd where they all listen to jam band music. Cartman pleads with the mayor to stop the festival, but it turns out that the mayor was the one who signed the permit for the music festival in the first place thinking it would make the town some money. After seeing the chaos that the eccentric hippies are creating, the mayor is ridden with guilt and shoots herself in the head (she survives, and appears later in the strategy room when Cartman is enacting his plan). Stan's parents know where the kids are, but when they realized what they did in Woodstock (which was very embarrassing), they go to save Stan. Randy tries to get through the crowd, but fails early due to excessive marijuana smoke exposure. The rest of the town then pleads with Cartman to rid the town of the hippies; Cartman eventually agrees to help, but only after Randy promises to offer a Tonka radio-controlled bulldozer and Kyle's mother assures Cartman that Kyle will never have one, instead having to watch Cartman playing with the bulldozer. Meanwhile, Stan, Kyle and Kenny realize that the hippies are doing nothing to oppose the corporations that they have demonized and that their idea of a perfect society is the same as the currently existing one. They try to leave but the crowd is 7 miles in radius and Stan's efforts to talk sense into the hippies only makes matters worse. Cartman, with the help of a scientist (Randy), an engineer (Butters Stotch's mother Linda) and a \\"black man to sacrifice himself in case anything goes wrong\\" (Chef), builds a giant drill to bore through the hippie crowd. While they are boring through, the drill breaks down and Chef goes out and \\"sacrifices\\" himself to pull the emergency power switch. Cartman then uploads the Slayer song \\"Raining Blood\\" into the speakers (as Cartman reasons, \\"hippies can't stand death metal\\"). The plan works and the hippies disperse, saving South Park, while Stan sees Randy and they end up hugging each other, knowing that they are safe. Cartman then pulls out a knife and tells Kyle that he has plans for him; Kyle is then forced to watch Cartman having fun with his Tonka bulldozer in the school parking lot. Production According to the DVD commentary for \\"Die Hippie, Die\\", the episode is a spoof of the 2003 film The Core. Trey Parker and Matt Stone wanted to mix a \\"really terrible\\" movie like The Core with music festivals like Burning Man, Bonnaroo, and Woodstock. In the first segment of the episode where Cartman is rounding up hippies, Cartman was originally dressed as Duane Chapman from the television series Dog the Bounty Hunter. However, Cartman's appearance was overhauled at the \\"last minute\\" because Parker and Stone felt that not many viewers would understand the reference. Cartman would later be dressed as Chapman in the season 10 episode \\"Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy\\". This is the final episode of the entire series in which Isaac Hayes provided new dialogue for the character Chef. Reception The episode is the subject of the opening chapter of David Sirota's 2011 book Back to Our Future. Sirota argues that Cartman's character can be read as encapsulating the 1980s conservative backlash against 1960s popular culture. The episode has been compared to the Occupy Wallstreet movement.http://www.redstate.com/diary/BigGator5/2011/10/30/die-hippie-die- south-park-took-down-ows-years-ago/ ReferencesExternal links * \\"Die Hippie, Die\\" Full episode at South Park Studios * \\"Die Hippie, Die\\" Episode guide at South Park Studios * \\"Die Hippie, Die\\" South Park Wiki * * Category:Hippie movement Category:South Park (season 9) episodes ","title":"Die Hippie, Die"},{"id":"1616958","text":"David Calderwood (157529 October 1650) was a Church of Scotland minister and historian. Calderwood was banished for his nonconformity, he found a home in the Low Countries, where he wrote his great work, the Altare Damasccnum. It was a serious attack on Anglican Episcopacy. Patiently and perseveringly Calderwood goes over the whole. The Bible, the Fathers, and the Canonists, are all referenced. Calderwood lived to see the principles for which he had suffered, and which he had defended, in complete ascendency. He was present at the Glasgow Assembly in 1638, and saw Prelacy and the Ceremonies swept away. He breathed his last at Jedburgh, a fugitive from his parish of Pencaitland; and they laid him in the churchyard of Crailing, where the first years of his ministry were spent. Royal conflict David Calderwood (1575–1650), ecclesiastic, historian, and theological writer, was born at Dalkeith, Midlothian, and educated at the college of Edinburgh. In 1604 he was ordained minister of Crailing in Roxburghshire. It was the time when King James was doing his utmost to introduce prelacy into the Church of Scotland, and from the very first Calderwood showed himself one of the sturdiest opponents of the royal scheme. His first public appearance in the controversial arena was in 1608, when James Law, bishop of Orkney, came to Jedburgh, ordered a presbytery to be held, and set aside an election of members to the general assembly already made, in order to substitute other representatives more in favour of the king's views. Calderwood openly protested against the jurisdiction of the bishop, for which offence he was deprived of his right to attend church courts, and required to confine himself to the limits of his parish, Silenced in this way and prevented from taking any part in public proceedings, he applied himself the more earnestly to the authority. In 1617, when the king visited Scotland, an occasion occurred for a more open and important act of resistance. Some ministers were in the habit of meeting at that time in Edinburgh in an informal way, to discuss various matters; and when it was agreed by the lords of articles to pass a decree giving power to the king, with the archbishops, bishops, and such ministers as he might choose, to direct the external policy of the kirk, a number of the ministers met and signed a protest against the decree. Prominent among them was Calderwood. This led to his being summoned to the royal presence to give an account of his 'mutinous and seditious' deed. A singular colloquy took place between the king and the minister. The king had great confidence in his powers of argument and condescended to argue with Calderwood. Though on his knees, Calderwood replied to the king with great coolness and cleverness, baffling his royal opponent. The courtiers were shocked at his fearless style of reply, and some even of his own friends were tugging at him, to induce him to show more complaisance. Occasionally the king lost patience and scolded him as 'a false puritan' and 'a very knave.' The matter ended in Calderwood being deprived of his charge, confined first in the prison of St. Andrews and then of Edinburgh, and finally ordered to leave the country. In Holland Calderwood betook himself to Holland, where he remained till the death of James in 1625. Here he had a severe attack of illness, and a rumour of his death was published along with a pretended recantation of his views, and an invitation to all to accept the ‘uniformity of the kirk.’ A very substantial proof was given that Calderwood was alive and in full vigour by the publication of a work entitled ‘Altare Damascenum,’ which, though appearing under the anagram of ‘Edwardus Didoclavius,’ was at once recognised as the production of Calderwood. ‘It was,’ says Mr. Thomson, in his life of Calderwood, prefixed to the Wodrow Society's edition of his history, ‘the great storehouse from which the prelatic arguments were subverted, and conversions to presbyterianism effected during the period of the second Scottish reformation. … It will only be from a correct translation of the “Altare Damascenum” that the public can derive a full idea of the eloquence, learning, and acute dialectic power of its author.’ Return to Scotland After Calderwood's return in 1625 to Scotland from Holland, he remained for some time without a charge. Powerful as a controversialist, he does not seem to have been either attractive as a speaker or of winning manner. It was not till 1640 that he obtained the charge of Pencaitland in East Lothian. He was employed, along with David Dickson and Alexander Henderson, in the drawing up of the Directory for Public Worship, which continued to be the recognised document for regulating the service in the church of Scotland. But the great work of Calderwood was the compilation of his ‘History of the Kirk of Scotland.’ When he had reached his seventy- third year, the general assembly, for the purpose of enabling him to perfect his work, granted him an annual pension of eight hundred pounds Scots. The history which he compiled was thrown into three different forms. The first and largest extended to 3,136 pages; less than a half of this work is now among the manuscripts of the British Museum. The second was a digest of the first, ‘in better order and wanting nothing of the substance;’ this was published by the Wodrow Society in 8 vols. 8vo, 1842–9. The third, another abbreviation, was first published in a folio volume in 1678, twenty-eight years after his death. Though little attractive in a literary sense, Calderwood's history is the great quarry for information on the ecclesiastical history of Scotland ‘beginning at Mr. Patrick Hamilton, and ending with the death of James the Sixth.’ Family Calderwood does not appear ever to have been married. His papers were bequeathed to a brother's family, a member of which, Sir William Calderwood of Polton (a judge in the supreme courts, under the title of Lord Polton), presented the manuscripts of his history to the British Museum on 29 Jan. 1765. Other collections of papers were given to Wodrow, in whose possession they were at the time of his death; these papers were purchased by the Faculty of Advocates in 1792. Works The following list of Calderwood's published writings is extracted from the life prefixed to the Wodrow Society's edition of his history, having been inserted there ‘from the appendix to the Life of Henderson in the miscellaneous writings of Dr. McCrie:’ *‘Perth Assembly,’ 1619. *‘Parasynagma Perthense,’ 1620. *‘Defence of our Arguments against kneeling in the act of receiving the sacramental elements of bread and wine, impugned by Mr. Michelsone,’ 1620. *‘A Dialogue betwixt Cosmophilus and Theophilus anent the urging of new Ceremonies upon the Kirk of Scotland,’ 1620. *‘The Speech of the Kirk of Scotland to her beloved children,’ 1620. *‘The Solution of Dr. Resolutus, his Resolutions.’ *‘The Altar of Damascus,’ 1621. *‘The Course of Conformitie,’ 1622. *‘Altare Damascenum: seu Ecclesiæ Anglicanæ Politia,’ 1623 (the Latin work is much fuller than the English). *‘A Reply to Dr. Morton's general Defence of Three Nocent Ceremonies,’ 1623. *‘A Reply to Dr. Morton's particular Defence of Three Nocent Ceremonies,’ 1623. *‘An Exhortation of the particular Kirks of Christ in Scotland to their sister Kirk in Edinburgh,’ 1624. *‘An Epistle of a Christian Brother,’ 1624. *‘A Dispute upon Communicating at our confused Communions,’ 1624. *‘The Pastor and the Prelate,’ 1628. *‘A Re-examination of the Five Articles enacted at Perth,’ 1636. *‘The Re-examination abridged,’ 1636. 18. ‘An Answer to Mr. J. Forbes of Corse, his Peaceable Warning,’ 1638. Bibliography *Life of David Calderwood, by Rev. Thomas Thomson, F.S.A.

Robert Wodrow, 1843 *Grub's Ecclesiastical History of Scotland, vols. ii. and iii. 1861 *Walker's Scottish Theology and Theologians, 1872. Walker says of the Altare Damascenum: ‘The Bible, the Fathers, the Canonists, are equally at his command. It does our church no credit that the Altare has never been translated. It seems to have been more in request out of Scotland than in it. … Among the Dutch divines he was ever Eminentissimus Calderwood.’ EB summary Calderwood was educated at Edinburgh, where he took the degree of MA in 1593. In about 1604, he became minister of Crailing, near Jedburgh in Roxburghshire, where he became conspicuous for his resolute opposition to the introduction of Episcopacy. In 1617, while James VI was in Scotland, a Remonstrance, which had been drawn up by the Presbyterian clergy, was placed in Calderwood's hands. He was summoned to St Andrews and examined before the king, but neither threats nor promises could make him deliver up the roll of signatures to the Remonstrance. He was deprived of his charge, committed to prison at St Andrews and afterwards removed to Edinburgh. The privy council ordered him to be banished from the kingdom for refusing to acknowledge the sentence of the High Commission. He lingered in Scotland, publishing a few tracts, till 27 August 1619, when he sailed for Holland. During his residence in Holland he published his Altare Damascenum. Calderwood appears to have returned to Scotland in 1624-1625. He was appointed minister of Pencaitland, in the county of East Lothian, in about 1640, where he was one of those appointed to draw up The Directory for Public Worship in Scotland. He continued to take an active part in the affairs of the church, and introduced in 1649 the practice, now confirmed by long usage, of dissenting from the decision of the General Assembly, and requiring the protest to be entered in the record. His last years were devoted to the preparation of The Historie of the Kirk of Scotland which was published in an abridged form in 1646. The complete work was printed (1842–49) for the Wodrow Society. In 1648 the General Assembly urged him to complete the work he had designed, and voted him a yearly pension of £800. Calderwood died at Jedburgh on 29 October 1650. He left behind him a historical work of great extent and of great value as a storehouse of authentic materials. An abridgment, which appears to have been prepared by Calderwood himself, was published after his death. An excellent edition of the complete work was published by the Wodrow Society, 8 vols, 1842-1849. The manuscript, which belonged to General Calderwood Durham, was presented to the British Museum.

Visible cameras  61 cm panchromatic 2.4 meter multispectral } QuickBird was a high- resolution commercial Earth observation satelliteDigitalglobe: QuickBird , owned by DigitalGlobe, launched in 2001 and decayed in 2015. QuickBird used Ball Aerospace's Global Imaging System 2000 (BGIS 2000). The satellite collected panchromatic (black and white) imagery at 61 centimeter resolution and multispectral imagery at 2.44- (at 450 km) to 1.63-meter (at 300 km) resolution, as orbit altitude is lowered during the end of mission life. At this resolution, detail such as buildings and other infrastructure are easily visible. However, this resolution is insufficient for working with smaller objects such as a license plate on a car. The imagery can be imported into remote sensing image processing software, as well as into GIS packages for analysis. Contractors included Ball Aerospace & Technologies, Kodak and Fokker Space. Original plans called for a constellation of three QuickBird satellites scheduled to be in orbit by 2008. In the end, two QuickBird satellites, QuickBird I and II, made it to launch pad. However, only QuickBird II made it successfully into orbit (QuickBird I suffered launch failure). Thus QuickBird II satellite is usually referred to simply as QuickBird, and by the name QuickBird is usually meant the satellite QuickBird II. Prior to QuickBird I and II, DigitalGlobe launched the EarlyBird 1 successfully in 1997 but the satellite lost communications after only four days in orbit due to power system failure. QuickBird I The first QuickBird, QuickBird I (or QuickBird 1, QB 1, COSPAR 2000-074A) was launched 20 November 2000, by EarthWatch from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in Russia by a Kosmos-3M rocket. QB-1 failed to reach planned orbit due to launch vehicle failure and was declared a failure. The satellite re-entered next day still attached to the upper stage of the rocket.DigitalGlode History – QuickBird I https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=2000-074A The QB-1 satellite was in construction similar to QuickBird 2 satellite (described above and below in this article), which became later known simply as QuickBird.https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/quickbird.htm  QuickBird II  QuickBird II (also QuickBird-2 or Quickbird 2, QB-2, COSPAR 2001-047A) or as it was later known, simply QuickBird, was launched for DigitalGlobe October 18, 2001 from the Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, aboard a Boeing Delta II rocket. The satellite was initially expected to collect at 1 meter resolution but after a license was granted in 2000 by the U.S. Department of Commerce / NASA, DigitalGlobe was able launch the QuickBird II with 0.61 meter panchromatic and 2.4 meter multispectral (previously planned 4 meter) resolution.  Mission Extension  In April 2011, the Quickbird satellite was raised from an orbit of to . The process, started in March 2011, extended the satellite's life. Before the operation the useful life of Quickbird was expected to drop off around mid-2012 but after the successful mission, the new orbit prolonged the satellite life into early 2015.  Decaying  The last picture was acquired on December 17, 2014. On January 27, 2015 QuickBird re- entered Earth's atmosphere.

This file is also referred to as a source file. Programming languages like C and C++ make use of these implementation files so as to separate the interface and implementation of these methods. Motivation Using this structure, a class definition file containing the declaration of the class and its members is also created. If the class definition has been included and the implementation file for its methods is available, the user can instantiate an object of the class. The purpose of this structure is to keep the implementation code hidden, but allow the user to view the design. Users make use of the public interface of an object so as to make creating objects as simple as possible, ensuring that client code does not distract the user with unnecessary details of the class's implementation. This allows the user the information needed to use the class effectively, but prevents him or her from damaging the compiled code. The structure of a class implementation file An implementation file is used in C++ programming when creating a class definition to split the interface from the implementation. The header file would declare all the member functions (methods) and data methods (fields) that the class has. The implementation file will contain the actual definition or source code of the methods declared in the header file. This file can start with a header block, which provides comments that describe the purpose of the defined class and any details about the creation of the actual file, such as the author of the file and date the file was created. It can also include any libraries from the C++ Standard Library that will be used by any of the declared methods in the file. The class implementation file will usually have a line to include the associated header file (see examples below). =Example in C++= An example would be having a class called \`ExampleClass\`. The header file of this C++ file would be named \\"example_class.h\\" and the implementation file would be \\"example_class.cc\\". An example of the structure of example_class.cc would look like this: #include \\"example_class.h\\" ExampleClass::ExampleClass() = default; void ExampleClass::AddSomething(int k) { ... } In this example, the implementation for the functions has been omitted, but the functions must be declared in example_class.h like this: #include class ExampleClass { public: ExampleClass(); // Constructor. void AddSomething(int k); private: std::string name_; }; =Example in Objective-C= Another example of how a class implementation file would be structured can be seen with Objective-C, which is used in iOS programming. This example will use \\"ExampleClass\\". A notable difference between C++ and Objective-C when making use of these implementation files is the extensions used at the end of the files. In C++ it will be .cpp and in Objective-C it will be .m, but both will use the same .h extension for their header file(s) as shown in the example below. This is an example of ExampleClass.h in Objective-C: #import @interface ExampleClass : NSObject { // instance variable declarations go here } \\\\- (NSString*) name; @end This is an example of the class's implementation file Exampleclass.m in Objective-C: #import \\"ExampleClass.h\\" @implementation ExampleClass \\\\- (NSString*) name { return @\\"…\\"; } @end See also *C++ classes *Header file *Source code *C++ Standard Library *Objective-C ReferencesExternal links * Header File and Implementation File Category:Class (computer programming) Category:Object- oriented programming languages Category:C++ Category:Articles with example Objective-C code ","title":"Class implementation file"},{"id":"1616969","text":"This is a list of heraldic charges. It does not cover those charges which are geometrical patterns and resemble partitions of the field; for these, see Ordinary (heraldry). Fox-Davies (1909) in his presentation of common heraldic charges divides them into the following categories (not including ordinaries and subordinaries): the human figure, the heraldic lion, beasts (mammals), monsters, birds, fish, reptiles, insects, plants (trees, leaves, fruits and flowers), and \\"inanimate objects\\". Subordinaries a shield with three lozenges. A number of simple geometric shapes have traditionally, and somewhat arbitrarily, been classified among the so-called subordinaries. (All other mobile charges are called common charges.) * lozenge ** fusil (a narrow lozenge; the term originally referred to a cone-shaped pulley, from Latin fūsus, \\"spindle\\") ** mascle (lozenge voided; related to \\"mesh\\") ** rustre (lozenge pierced; from German Raute, \\"rhombus\\") * billet (a rectangle) * annulet (a ring) * roundel, but different tinctures have different names: for example roundels argent are called plates. A roundel barry wavy azure and argent is called a fountain. * label: commonly a mark of difference, but also appears as an independent charge. * fret: originally woven from three bendlets (dexter) and three bendlets sinister, now usually a single bendlet each way interwoven with a mascle. Human figures 251x251px *Soldiers, armed men **Two armed men in combat, for Manesse (Zürich armorial, c. 1340) **A Cossack appears in the arms of Cherkasy, Ukraine. **Cossack with musket *Rider **Saint George and the dragon **Pahonia *A pilgrim (St Fridolin) for Glarus *Wild men **for Klosters and the League of Ten Jurisdictions (16th century) *Virgin and Child with Saint Anne for Annaberg-Buchholz (1501) *A maid holding a wreath, for Magdeburg *A child (later also a Moor or Turk) being devoured by the Biscione (serpent), for Visconti of Milan *A crowned Moorish queen for the counts of Kirchberg, Swabia (13th century), hence the municipal arms of Illerkirchberg =Parts of human bodies= Coat of arms of the Hungarian town 198x198px * The head **Maure **Skull and crossbones *The hand, or hand and arm, is the most common part of the human body to be a charge. **Arm and hammer * The ear *Feet **alt=(human) foot sole * Teeth * Tongue * The heart, even when blazoned \\"a human heart\\", always appears like the heart in a deck of cards rather than a natural human heart. * A \\"dug\\" or woman's breast \\"distilling drops of milk\\" famously appears in the arms of the Dodge family, and appeared for a time on the badge of cars made by the Dodge Automotive company. * Beards * Testicles: the Neapolitan family of Coglione bore per fess argent and gules, three pairs of testicles counterchanged. The similar coat of the Counts Colleoni of Milan is sometimes blazoned Per pale argent and gules, three hearts reversed counterchanged.John Woodward and George Burnett, A Treatise on Heraldry, British and Foreign, page 203 Beasts Any animal can be a heraldic charge, although more traditional ones vary in the exactitude with which they resemble the creature as found in nature. Animals depicted naturally are either described as natural or using the scientific nomenclature. =Predatory beasts= Lion as a primary charge in the coat of arms of Finland. *Felines ** The lion. ** The heraldic tyger is an imaginary monster; where the natural beast appears it is blazoned as a Bengal tiger. ** A leopard refers to a lion \\"passant guardant\\", rather than a natural leopard, in the languages of French and English heraldry. A leopard's face also occurs, sometimes jessant-de-lys. ** A heraldic panther is usually depicted spitting fire ** The (domestic) cat, distinguished from the wild cat or \\"cat-a- mountain\\" *Canines ** Fox ** Hound (dog). The two most common breeds are the talbot (dog) and greyhound. ** Wolf * Bear * Brock or (badger) * Weasels such as the Ermine (stoat) * Otter * Thylacine =Ungulates= *Diocese of Camden. Antelope, usually blazoned as a specific type unless it is the mythical heraldic antelope. * Cattle Bulls, cows or calves. ** Zebu * Camel * Deer usually a red deer, also called a hart or Stag, and the Buck denotes a Fallow deer. Females are called hinds or does. ** Stags ** Caribou or Reindeer. Sometimes depicted naturally, sometimes as a deer with four antlers. * Equines such as the ass and the horse sometimes of a specified breed and the unicorn and Pegasus. * Hippopotamus * Rhinoceros * Swine either wild boars or domestic pigs * Sheep and Goats Including Rams, ewes, lambs, ibex and Agnus Dei =Other mammals= *Marsupials **Bandicoots and Bilbies ** Kangaroos, Wallaroos, and Wallabies ** Koala ** Opossums ** Possums ** Wombat * Monotremes such as Platypuses and Echidnas * Apes and Monkey (or jack-a-napes From \\"Jack of Naples\\" (Jac-a-Napes), later (early modern period) reanalyzed as \\"jack-an-apes\\", taking \\"apes\\" as \\"ape, monkey\\".

The monkey as heraldic animal remained comparatively rare, but it is on record from as early as the 14th century, as in the Affenstein crest from the Zürich armorial (c. 1340). * Elephant; sometimes with a Howdah or castle on its backThe coat of arms of the 64th Armor Regiment of the United States Army specifies, bizarrely, \\"the head of a fighting African elephant,\\" though there should be no distinction made between this and the depiction of a default elephant. * Mole (or moldiwarp) * Porcupine * Hedgehog (or urcheon). * Beaver * Squirrel * Rabbits, Hares, and coneys ** Three hares *Seal =Reptiles and amphibians= * The serpent usually depicted nowed. ** Ouroboros * The salamander is typically shown as a generic lizard, sometimes with a head of unusual shape often described as \\"dog-shaped\\", and always surrounded by flames. * The lizard * The Biscione * Dragon: by default a European one, but also a Chinese dragon. ** Wyvern: similar to a dragon, but with only two legs. ** Zilant: a form of dragon appearing in Russian heraldry. * Tortoises and Turtles =Insects= Insects include: * Bee, often flying around beehives, natural or man-made * Butterfly * Dragonfly * Emmet (heraldry) * Flea * Fly * Grasshopper * Scorpion * Spider * Crab =Hybrids= A sea-lion, illustrated in A Complete Guide to Heraldry (1909). * Sphinx: depicted with the head and breasts of a woman. * Griffin, combining the head (but with ears), chest, wings and forelegs of the eagle with the hindquarters and legs of a lion (A sub-type of griffin, the Keythong lacks wings with the upper body having armor plate like feathers and its lower body is scattered with sharp spiny quills). See List of griffins as mascots and in heraldry. * Unicorn, having a horse's body, deer's legs, goat's beard, and often a lion's tail * The hippogriff is like the griffin except that the lion parts of the griffin are replaced by those of a horse. * Harpy * Theow is a wolf-like creature but with cloven hooves. * The \\"sea-horse\\" (hippocampus) is depicted as half horse and half fish * The sea-lion is a combination of a lion and a fish. * Any combination of parts of other animals, e.g. winged reindeer, is possible. Birds By far the most frequent heraldic bird is the eagle. A variant is the alerion, without beak or feet, seen in the arms of the duchy of Lorraine (of which it is not quite an anagram). Also very frequent is the martlet, a conventional swallow depicted without feet or the French variant the merlette, which also omits the beak. * Auk * Avalerion * Cock ** Gallic rooster * Cockatoo * Cormorant * Corvus * Crane * Dove * Duck without beak or legs is called the merlette * Eagle, usually displayed, i.e. with wings spread ** Alerion: eagle without beak or feet ** Double-headed eagle ** Triple-headed eagle ** Golden eagle#Heraldry and myth *** Eagle of Saladin, a symbol associated with secular Arab nationalism, contrasted with the Hawk of Quraish * Emu * Falcon * Garuda * Goose * Gull or seagull * Hawk ** Hawk of Quraish, a symbol associated with political Islam and Arab monarchy, contrasted with the Eagle of Saladin * Heron * Kiwi * Kookaburra * Magpie: Otton de Cazeneuve bore \\"Or, three magpies sable\\" at Falkirk. * Martlet * Osprey: almost invariably depicted simply as an eagle argent, often maintaining (holding in its talons or beak) a fish * Ostrich or its feathers * Owl * Papingo or Popinjay (parrot). * Pelican, sometimes with its young. **When a pelican is blazoned as \\"vulning\\", it refers to a pelican injuring herself, while a pelican \\"in her piety\\" refers to a female pelican feeding her young with her own blood. * Peacock often blazoned in its pride * Phoenix * Stork * Swan ** Black swans * Turkey cock: was a later immigrant from the New World * Turul * Egg: rare. Fish and creatures of the sea \\"Fish\\" are sometimes only described as \\"a fish\\", but the species is often named: * Carp * Catfish * Cod * Conger * Cuttlefish * Dolphin * Eel * \\"Garvine fishes\\", in canting contexts * The pike, also called a ged or Lucy * Perch * Roach * Salmon * Sturgeon * Herring * The seahorse is depicted as half horse and half fish, but if the natural seahorse is to be depicted it is blazoned as a \\"seahorse (hippocampus)\\". * The whale * The escallop (scallop shell) * Mullet * Mussels appear in the arms of Musselburgh in Scotland. * Whelk shell * Mermaid and Melusine * Mahseer - used in Indian Muslim heraldry, such as the coat of arms of Bhopal State, Kurwai State, or the Kingdom of Oudh.

A rose on top of another rose form a double rose. ** though there are several unusual different types blazoned, such as the Luther rose. ** White Rose of York; Red Rose of Lancaster; Tudor Rose, which is a double rose. * The lotus flower * The thistle *Other commonly used flower-like charges (called \\"foils\\") include: ** Trefoil (with three petals; usually slipped, with a stem) ** Quatrefoil (with four petals) ** Cinquefoil (with five petals) ** Sexfoil (with six petals) ** The septfoil (with seven petals) ** The double quatrefoil (with eight petals)—in England the rare cadency mark of a ninth son. * Strawberries and the strawberry flowers depicted as cinquefoils * Tulips * Grapevines =Trees and their fruits= Trees appear as eradicated (showing the roots) or couped. Fruit can appear on a tree, or by itself. Also, leaves and branches appear. * Tree trunk * Apple tree * Cherry * Pears (with peartrees) *Coffee, including branches and beans =Other flora= * Maple leaf - symbol of Canada Alder in the coat of arms of Grossarl, Austria. Trees are sometimes merely blazoned as \\"a tree\\" but specific trees are mentioned in blazon. * The oak and the acorn * The pines and the pine-cone also called a pineapple. * Elm * Poplar, also called aspen * Willow, also called Salix or Osiers; its branch is called a wand * Alder * Coconut tree * Palm * Laurel trees * Olive * The pomegranate tree * Cannabis * Grass, often on a mound * Seeblatt A small group of trees is blazoned as a hurst, grove, wood or thicket. =Grain crops and vegetables= Barley (French orge) in the arms of Orges, Switzerland * Wheat occurs in the form of \\"garbs\\" or sheaves and as ears, though sometimes garbs represent another crop ** a garb of hay * Ears of rye are depicted exactly as wheat, except the ears droop down. * \\"Ginny wheat\\" or \\"guinea wheat\\" (like wheat but with a fatter ear) also exists * Cabbage * Leek Inanimate charges Regarding \\"inanimate objects\\", Fox-Davies (1909:281) comments: :\\"one can safely say that there is scarcely an object under the sun which has not at some time or other been introduced into a coat of arms or crest. One cannot usefully make a book on armory assume the character of a general encyclopedia on useful knowledge, and reference will only be made in this chapter to a limited number, including those which from frequent usage have obtained a recognised heraldic character.\\" =Crosses= Originally representing the Christian cross used as field sign and standard during the Crusades, heraldic crosses diversified into many variants in the late medieval to early modern period, the most common (besides the plain \\"Greek cross\\") being the cross potent, cross pattée, cross fleury, cross moline, cross crosslet (etc.). =Lettering= Langenmantel vom RR family coat of arms as shown in Siebmachers Wappenbuch (1605). Lettering in coats of arms are usually placed in the motto, not in the heraldic shield as a charge. However, a tradition of introducing individual letters as heraldic charges on the basis of acrophony originates in the 15th to 16th century, primarily in personal and municipial heraldry, and with some frequency in the modern period, appearing more often on the continent than in British heraldry where letters as charges have traditionally been discouraged. Fox-Davies (1909:281) regarding letters of the alphabet as heraldic charges: :\\"Instances of these are scarcely common, but the family of KekitmoreJohn Guillim, A Display of Heraldry (1780), p. 295. may be adduced as bearing 'Gules, three S's or,' while Bridlington Priory had for arms 'Per pale, sable and argent, three B's countercharged.' [...] Corporate arms (in England) afford an instance of alphabetical letters in the case of the B's on the shield of Bermondsey.\\" One of the earliest instances of the use of letters as heraldic charges is that of the Langenmantel family of Augsburg.

Early life Birney was born in Huntsville, Alabama, the son of an abolitionist from Kentucky, James G. Birney. The Birney family returned to Kentucky in 1833, and James Birney freed his slaves. In 1835, the family moved to Cincinnati, where the father published an anti-slavery newspaper. Following numerous threats from pro- slavery mobs, the family moved again to Michigan, and finally to Philadelphia. Following his graduation from Phillips Academy, Andover, Massachusetts,Bates, p. 557. David Birney entered business, studied law, and was admitted to the bar. He returned to Philadelphia, practicing law from 1856 until the outbreak of the Civil War. Civil War Hancock and fellow division commanders Barlow and Gibbon during the Wilderness campaign Birney entered the Union army just after Fort Sumter as lieutenant colonel of the 23rd Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry, a unit he raised largely at his own expense. Just prior to the war he had been studying military texts in preparation for such a role. He was promoted to colonel on August 31, 1861, and to brigadier general on February 17, 1862, clearly benefiting from political influences, not military merit. He commanded a brigade in Brig. Gen. Philip Kearny's division of the III Corps, which he led through the Peninsula Campaign. At the Battle of Seven Pines he was accused of disobeying an order from his corps commander, Maj. Gen. Samuel P. Heintzelman, allegedly for \\"halting his command a mile from the enemy.\\" But this was simply a matter of orders misunderstood. Birney was court-martialed, but with strong positive testimony from Kearny, he was acquitted and restored to command. Birney then led his brigade in the Seven Days Battles, primarily at Glendale. He fought at the Second Battle of Bull Run in support of Maj. Gen. John Pope's Army of Virginia, and at the Battle of Chantilly immediately following. When Kearny was killed in that battle, Birney took over command of his division. Stationed in Washington, D.C., he missed the Battle of Antietam, but his division returned to the Army of the Potomac to fight at Fredericksburg. There, he once again encountered military discipline problems, this time for allegedly refusing to support Maj. Gen. George G. Meade's division's attack on the left flank of the Union line. However, he was complimented in III Corps commander Maj. Gen. George Stoneman's official report for \\"the handsome manner in which he handled his division\\" on that same day and for a second time he escaped punishment. Birney led his division in heavy fighting at Chancellorsville, where they suffered more casualties (1,607) than any other division in the army. As a result of his distinguished service at Chancellorsville, he was promoted to major general on May 20, 1863. David B. Birney Grave at the Woodlands Cemetery At the Battle of Gettysburg, III Corps commander Daniel Sickles pulled his troops out of line, creating an isolated, exposed salient in the Union line. The Confederate divisions of John B. Hood and Lafayette McLaws slammed into the III Corps, and Birney's division, hit on three sides, was completely demolished in the fighting with severe casualties. As Birney watched the few survivors of his division gather about him on Cemetery Ridge, he whispered to one of his officers, \\"I wish I were already dead.\\"Tagg, p. 67. Sickles had his leg shattered by an artillery shell and Birney assumed temporary command of the corps, despite having received two minor wounds himself. Birney was in temporary command of the III Corps for a few days after Gettysburg, when the more senior General William H. French was named permanent commander. French quickly gained notoriety for his inept handling of the III Corps, and unlike Birney, he was an outsider to the corps and unpopular with the soldiers. Birney started in the Overland Campaign as a division commander in the II Corps, his III Corps having been reorganized out of existence that spring. After good service in the Wilderness, Spotsylvania Court House (where he was wounded by a shell fragment), and Cold Harbor, on July 23, 1864, Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant gave Birney command of the X Corps in the Army of the James. During the Siege of Petersburg, Birney became ill with diarrhea. At first, this was a minor complaint and he was able to remain in command, but in September his health started to get worse. However, Birney was reluctant to take a leave of absence and so tried to remain on duty. On October 7, he was so sick that he had to be transported in an ambulance. The corps medical director requested that Birney be sent home at once, and he was taken to Philadelphia, where he became delirious. The doctors diagnosed his condition as typhomalaria, and he died on October 18 after experiencing uncontrollable gastrointestinal bleeding. The exact cause of Birney's death has been speculated to be typhoid fever. He was buried in Woodlands Cemetery. Legacy David Birney was one of the more successful \\"political generals\\" of the Civil War. Many of his colleagues resented his swift rise in the ranks and he was not a beloved figure with them or his soldiers. Theodore Lyman of Meade's staff wrote of Birney:Tagg, p. 63. The Gen. David B. Birney School, a Philadelphia public school named in Birney's honor, was built in 1912-1913. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.

Coliform bacteria are microorganisms that primarily originate in the intestines of warm-blooded animals. By testing for coliforms, especially the well known Escherichia coli (E. coli), which is a thermotolerant coliform, one can determine if the water has possibly been exposed to fecal contamination; that is, whether it has come in contact with human or animal feces. It is important to know this because many disease-causing organisms are transferred from human and animal feces to water, from where they can be ingested by people and infect them. Water that has been contaminated by feces usually contains pathogenic bacteria, which can cause disease. Some types of coliforms cause disease, but the coliform index is primarily used to judge if other types of pathogenic bacteria are likely to be present in the water. The coliform index is used because it is difficult to test for pathogenic bacteria directly. There are many different types of disease-causing bacteria, and they are usually present in low numbers which do not always show up in tests. Thermotolerant coliforms are present in higher numbers than individual types of pathogenic bacteria and they can be tested relatively easily. However, the coliform index is far from perfect. Thermotolerant coliforms can survive in water on their own, especially in tropical regions, so they do not always indicate fecal contamination. Furthermore, they do not give a good indication of how many pathogenic bacteria are present in the water, and they give no idea at all of whether there are pathogenic viruses or protozoa which also cause diseases and are rarely tested for. Therefore, it does not always give accurate or useful results regarding the purity of water. See also *Indicator organism *Bacteriological water analysis References *Gleeson, C. and Gray, N (1997).

He was admitted to practice law in Illinois and Minnesota in 1940, shortly after joining his father's law firm in Duluth. He received his commission as a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps Reserve in February 1940 and in March of that year was placed in command of the Duluth unit of the Marine Corps Reserve, which was mobilized and sent to San Diego for training. He then served in Iceland for ten months. At Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands, he participated in the first United States offensive of World War II, commanding a company of the 1st Marine Division. His next combat action was the Battle of Okinawa, for which he was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. While serving as executive officer of a battalion of the 22nd Marines, 6th Marine Division on Okinawa, he was killed in action after exhibiting great courage and self-sacrifice leading a successful night attack against enemy positions on Sugar Loaf Hill 14-May 15, 1945. He was also posthumously awarded the Purple Heart and Gold Star in lieu of a second Purple Heart for wounds received in that campaign. The Medal of Honor was presented to his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Henry A. Courtney, Sr., of Duluth on December 30, 1947, by Commandant of the Marine Corps General Alexander A. Vandegrift.

COURTNEY, JR. UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS RESERVE for service as set forth in the following CITATION: :For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty as Executive Officer of the Second Battalion, Twenty-Second Marines, Sixth Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces on Okinawa Shima in the Ryukyu Islands, 14 and 15 May 1945. Ordered to hold for the night in static defense behind Sugar Loaf Hill after leading the forward elements of his command in a prolonged fire fight, Major Courtney weighed the effect of a hostile night counterattack against the tactical value of an immediate Marine assault, resolved to initiate the assault, and promptly obtained permission to advance and seize the forward slope of the hill. Quickly explaining the situation to his small remaining force, he declared his personal intention of moving forward and then proceeded on his way, boldly blasting near-by cave positions and neutralizing enemy guns as he went. Inspired by his courage, every man followed without hesitation, and together the intrepid Marines braved a terrific concentration of Japanese gunfire to skirt the hill on the right and reach the reverse slope. Temporarily halting, Major Courtney sent guides to the rear for more ammunition and possible replacements. subsequently reinforced by twenty-six men and a LVT load of grenades, he determined to storm the crest of the hill and crush any planned counterattack before it could gain sufficient momentum to effect a break-through. Leading his men by example rather than by command, he pushed ahead with unrelenting aggressiveness, hurling grenades into cave openings on the slope with devastating effect. Upon reaching the crest and observing large numbers of Japanese forming for action less than one hundred yards away, he instantly attacked, waged a furious battle and succeeded in killing many of the enemy and in forcing the remainder to cover in the caves. Determined to hold, he ordered his men to dig in and, coolly disregarding the continuous hail of flying enemy shrapnel to rally his weary troops, tirelessly aided casualties and assigned his men to more advantageous positions. Although instantly killed by mortar burst while moving among his men, Major Courtney, by his astute military acumen, indomitable leadership and decisive action in the face of overwhelming odds, had contributed essentially to the success of the Okinawa Campaign and his great personal valor throughout sustained and enhanced the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country. /S/ HARRY S.

Quinpool Road is increasingly considered to be an arbitrary border between the South and North Ends, though Quinpool Road is also a part of the West End, and is home, for example, to the West End Baptist Church.  History  The historic South End of colonial Halifax was originally bounded on the south by \\"South Street\\", that being the few blocks located south of Citadel Hill, just as the North End comprised the area bounded on the north by \\"North Street\\". The areas south of South Street and west of the South Common was largely farmland and mixed forest which led to the development of large estates to take advantage of their proximity to the city and garrison. Over time, neighbourhoods began to develop outside the original city boundary and were amalgamated into the city proper. One of Halifax's largest megaprojects in history saw the completion in 1918 of a major railway line through a deep rock cut for several kilometres, parallelling the shore of the Northwest Arm, to serve a new railway station at the south end of the city's business district. The new railway line had been under construction by the Intercolonial Railway and later Canadian Government Railways at the time of the Halifax Explosion, which blocked and badly damaged the city's North Street station. The new railway line through the South End was rushed into completion to accommodate the unexpected disaster. One result of the building of this railway line has been to geographically isolate parts of the peninsula, creating opportunities for wealthy and exclusive neighbourhoods to develop. Another legacy of the blasting work created during the construction of the South End railway cut was the infilling of parts of Halifax Harbour and Bedford Basin to create railway yards and freight and passenger ship docks. The South End has become the most prosperous region of Halifax, with a middle-class demographic.South End (Halifax) - Canada's wealthiest neighbourhoods MSN Money There is also a high student population, owing to the presence of Dalhousie University, Saint Mary's University, University of King's College, and the Atlantic School of Theology.

A division of Panini Group, which also produces collectable stickers, it is headquartered in Modena, Italy.\\"Corporate Info .\\" Panini Group. Retrieved on 5 September 2009. The company publishes comic books in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Mexico, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom, as well as manga in several non-English-speaking countries through the Planet Manga publishing division. In the United Kingdom, Panini Comics prints its Collectors' Edition (CE) line, which consists of reprints of Marvel US Comics. These are usually 76 pages long (with the occasional 100 page special). Each comic is published every 28 days, with the exception of Astonishing Spider-Man which has been published fortnightly since volume 2. HistoryItaly and international= Panini Comics started as an evolution of \\"Marvel Italia\\", an Italian division of Marvel Comics created in 1994 to publish Marvel titles in Italy, the rights to which had been previously held by different publishers (Star Comics, Comic Art, Play Press and Max Bunker Press). In December 1994, Marvel Italia was absorbed by Edizioni Panini of Modena, following the acquisition of the latter by Marvel Comics. Panini Comics in Italy has since evolved to encompass a series of sub-divisions: * Marvel Italia, publishing translations of main Marvel Comics' US series * Cult Comics, publishing translations of US comics not of Marvel origin (including Image Comics, Dynamite Entertainment, Dark Horse Comics) as well as original Italian comics * Planet Manga (previously Marvel Manga), publishing mostly translations of manga * Panini Video, releasing DVDs Subsequently, Marvel Comics sold Panini to a group of investors including Indesit Company. Currently, Panini Comics also publishes in Brazil, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal and Hungary. In Germany and Brazil, it also publishes translations of DC Comics series. = UK = Panini obtained the Marvel UK license in 1995, enabling it to publish reprinted American Marvel Comics titles. They also began publishing the Doctor Who Magazine. Panini Comics had been part of Marvel Europe, and had already been reprinting American material across the continent for several years. Thanks to this licensing deal, reprints of American Marvel Comics material were continued in the UK by Panini from the mid-1990s. Each issue of their 'Marvel Collector's Editions' series contained approximately two or three Marvel US strips in one issue with possibly a \\"classic\\" comic printed as a substitute for an installment in the current run, whilst being priced at a reasonable level. Initially the lineup consisted of only Astonishing Spider-Man and Essential X-Men and followed the continuity of the US comics, however it was approximately two to three years behind the current run in America. In addition to reprinting the mainstream US comics, Panini also published a monthly (later every three weeks) oversized comic, entitled The Spectacular Spider-Man, for younger readers to accompany Spider- Man: The Animated Series, which began broadcasting in the UK in the mid-90s. Initially, the stories were simply reprints of the US comics based on the series, but eventually the title moved to all-new UK-originated stories, marking the first Marvel UK material featuring classic Marvel characters to be produced since early 1994. 2000s Panini Comics booth at the 2017 \\"Saló del Còmic de Barcelona\\" (Barcelona Comic Convention) Panini have since extended their line to include other characters within the Marvel Universe. In addition to Essential X-Men and Astonishing Spider-Man came Wolverine Unleashed, in which Wolverine's solo comic was reprinted. The comic ran for 54 issues before it was renamed Wolverine & Gambit to allow reprints of the Gambit series, and subsequently Wolverine and Deadpool when the Gambit material had been exhausted and Deadpool was introduced as a replacement in 2004. Marvel Heroes Reborn was released in 1997, to introduce the new Heroes Reborn saga, and expand the range of characters in Marvel UK's lineup. It was initially published with only two strips (or 56 pages) but this was expanded to 76 pages (commonly 3 strips) from issue 17 onwards. Unfortunately, this title was short lived due to continuously lagging sales, and was eventually cancelled in 2000. Later titles include Avengers United (later replaced by Avengers Unconquered), Fantastic Four Adventures, Marvel Legends featuring Captain America, Iron Man and Thor, a new The Mighty World of Marvel as well as the introduction of the Ultimate Marvel imprint, consisting of Ultimate Spider-Man and X-Men (which was originally two titles, which merged since it was reprinting the stories too fast for Marvel US to print them) and Ultimate Fantastic Four (cancelled because of low sales, and because it was only a few issues behind the US title by the end). In March 2006, Marvel Entertainment and Panini S.p.A announced that they had \\"renewed and expanded their publishing agreement under which Panini retains a master license for producing translated versions of Marvel comics for Europe and selected Latin American countries. The new agreement includes a major expansion of editorial projects in which Panini will originate new content under the creative supervision of Marvel.\\"\\"Marvel Renews & Expands Its Panini Deal: Share A Milo Manara 'Women of the X-Men' Graphic Novel,\\" ICv2 (March 30, 2006).

Other titles Alongside these mainly reprint titles, Panini continues to print Doctor Who Magazine which still features originally produced comics by British creators.

He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1987 to 1995 who represented the riding of Brampton North. He was subsequently an unsuccessful Progressive Conservative candidate in the 2007 provincial election. In July 2018, he announced candidacy for Ward 1 & 5 Regional councillor from Brampton in the 2018 municipal election. Background McClelland moved to Canada at a young age, and received a Bachelor of Arts degree York University and a law degree from the University of Windsor. After graduation, he practised law as an associate at the firm of Fogler, Rubinoff, Toronto. He was also a board member of the Canadian Council of Christian Charities. Politics McClelland ran for the Ontario legislature in the general election of 1977, losing to New Democrat (NDP) Ted Bounsall by over 3,500 votes in Windsor—Sandwich. The next year, McClelland narrowly lost the race for a seat on the Windsor Board of Education representing Ward 1. In 1980, he was appointed as a board member for Ward 1 after the death of trustee Donald Hill, but was again narrowly defeated in the general election that November. He did not seek office again until the 1987 provincial election, when he was easily elected in Brampton North as part of a Liberal landslide victory. McClelland served as a backbench supporter of David Peterson's government for the next three years. Prior to the 1990 election, McClelland was challenged for the Liberal nomination in his riding by the representative of a group which claimed the Peterson government had made insufficient outreach efforts to Ontario's Sikh community. He won the nomination challenge, and went on to defeat NDP challenger John Devries by only 98 votes in the general election. The Liberals were upset by the NDP provincially, and McClelland moved to the opposition benches for the next five years. In 1993, he brought forward a private member's bill dealing with the possibility of electoral recall. The Progressive Conservatives won a majority government in the 1995 Ontario election, and McClelland lost to PC candidate Joe Spina by 5,348 votes. In 2007, McClelland changed parties and was the PC candidate for the riding of Brampton-Springdale in the 2007 Ontario election, but lost to the Liberal candidate Linda Jeffrey by nearly 7,000 votes. Return to legal practice In 1995, he resumed his legal practice and is now a member and VP of the Peel Law Association Executive Committee. He has also been President (2008–2009) of the Brampton Board of Trade. In May 2015, the Law Society of Upper Canada suspended McClelland for mishandling the finances of several clients including some family members.

Family background and early life Toirdelbhach was born in the year 1088. He was the youngest son of Ruaidrí na Saide Buide (died 1118), and his mother was Mór, daughter of Toirdelbach Ua Briain (1009–14 July 1086). Therefore, through his mother, his great-great-grandfather was Brian Boru. His brothers were Niall (killed 1093), Tadc (killed 1097), Conchobar (murdered 1103), and Domnall, King of Connacht (deposed 1106). There was at least one sister, Dubhchobhlaigh Bean Ua hEaghra of Luighne Connacht (died 1131). Ruaidrí was married to four or more women. According to the Annals of Tigernach, Toirdelbach's mother died the year he was born, suggesting his birth may have been arduous. In 1092, King Ruaidrí was blinded by Flaithbertaigh Ua Flaithbertaigh, an incident which led to the domination of Connacht by the Dál gCais of Munster, led by Tairrdelbach's uncle, the brother of Tairrdelbach's mother, Muirchertach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland, who possibly took Tairrdelbach into his household to groom him for the day when he would be king of Connacht. (p. 471,MIAE 2005) However this would not occur until 1106; until then, Connacht endured a prolonged period of civil strife between different factions of the Uí Conchobair, Uí Ruairc of Bréifne as well as more minor families of the Uí Briúin and Síol Muireadaigh, including the long-displaced Ui Fiachrach Aidhne. Tairrdelbach's brothers Tadc and Domnall both gained the kingship at different times, but depended upon the support of Muircherteach Ua Briain. Early Reign  The Cross of Cong, a reliquary and processional cross that contains a piece of the True Cross, was commissioned by Toirdelbach and made at Roscommon. In 1106, with the support of his uncle Muirchertach Ua Briain, eighteen-year-old Tairrdelbach deprived his older brother Domnall of the kingship of Connacht. \\"Tairrdelbach carefully maintained his alliance with Ua Briain, sending troops to aid the High King against the Ui Ruaric of Bréifne in 1109. But he was also determined to defend his kingdom against predators such as Domnall Mac Lochlainn of the Uí Néill (d. 1121), king of the north of Ireland.\\" In 1110, Mac Lochlainn raided Connacht, carrying off herds of cattle and captives. While this raid rattled Toirdelbach, he demonstrated that he was not weak by attacking the Conmaicne and Breifne, with mixed fortunes; he defeated the former at Mag Na, but his army was defeated by the men of Breifne at Mag Brenair. He attacked the Northern Uí Néill the next year in 1111, plundering Termonn Dabeoc in Tír Chonaill and ravaging modern County Fermanagh as far as Lough Erne. Domnall, Toirdelbach's brother who he had taken the Kingship of Connacht from would remain in Connacht, however, and contested Toirdelbach's claim to the throne of the Kingdom, but he was finally expelled southward to Munster by Toirdelbhach several years later in 1114. A year later in 1115, an attempt to assassinate him was made by some of his nobles who were discontent with his rule at Ath Bo, but they were unsuccessful. Although much of his time and resources during his early reign was spent in Munster, he also involved in campaigns elsewhere. In 1115, his wife Orlaith of the Kingdom of Meath died, ending the alliance between Toirdelbach and Murchad Ia Mael Sechnaill, King of Meath. Toirdelbach defeated their forces on both land and on the River Shannon, gaining the submission of Meath. He later married Connacht nobleman Cailleach De, daughter of Ua hEidin, who was the mother of future High King Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair, Toirdelbach's son. At the end of 1115, he bestowed gifts upon the church at the monastery at Clonmacaoise, including a drinking horn and chalice. A tactic Toirdelbhach used throughout his career in politics and as High King was divide and rule. This can be seen in several instances, most notably the partition of Munster, which at the time, under the rule of the Ua Briain (O'Brien dynasty) was the most powerful kingdom in Ireland and had controlled the High Kingship for over a century, since the death of Brian Boru.  Partition and war in Munster  In 1114, Toirdelbhach took advantage of political turmoil in the Kingdom of Munster, which at the time was ruled by his uncle, Muircherteach Ua Briain, King of Munster and High King of Ireland, who had previously often supported Toirdelbach as he reigned in Connacht and was the one who backed him to take the Kingship from his brother, had become \\"sick to the point of a living Skeleton\\". It was at this point that Diarmuid, brother of Muircherteach, took the Kingship and banished Muircherteach. Tairrdelbach had been scheming against Munster with Muircherteach's enemies, mainly Domnall mac Lochlainn in Ulster and Murchad Ua Máel Sechnaill of the Kingdom of Meath to his east, and they supported Diarmuit's claim to the throne, but Diarmuit soon rose in rebellion against Toirdelbhach. In response, Toirdelbach attacked Munster, ravaging Thomond and expelling Diarmuit. A year later in 1115, Muircherteach Ia Briain regained his strength and led campaigns against his brother to regain the Kingship, with backing from Toirdelbach and other powerful kings, in an attempt to restore order in the province. However, this war would remain a stalemate for several years, and allowed others both within and outside the Kingdom to scheme and form their own plans against Munster. In 1118, Muircherteach and, with backing from Toirdelbach, Ua Máel Sechnaill, and Aéd Ua Ruairc of the Kingdom of Breifne, attacked Tadgh Mac Carthaigh of the MacCarthy Mór dynasty. But they turned against Muircherteach at Glanmire in County Cork, allying with the MacCarthys to remove the High King from power once and for all. At the same time, Toirdelbach's forces attacked Leinster, Osraige and Dublin, which were still held by he Ua Briain's, removing Domnall Ua Briain as governor of Dublin, and forcing the forces of the three kingdoms to join Toirdelbach in his campaigns against Munster. Toirdelbach even went as far as destroying the Ua Briain palace at Kincora, Killaloe. Meanwhile in south-west Munster, in modern Counties Cork and Kerry, the Mac Carthaigh (MacCarthys), another royal dynasty of Munster who had been living under the rule of the Ua Briain rebelled. Toirdelbach, eager to further destabilize Munster, backed this revolt. Toirdelbach then resolved the issue he had created by partitioning Munster in 1118. The province was partitioned into the Kingdoms of Thomond, under the rule of the Ua Briain Dynasty, the Kingdom of Desmond, under the rule of the Mac Carthaigh Mór Dynasty, and finally the short-lived Kingdom of Osraige, under the rule of the Kennedy Dynasty, though the latter kingdom was small in comparison to the other two and were rarely involved in the politics or struggles for the Kingship of Munster. But it was around this point that Muircherteach finally managed to successfully topple his brother Diarmuid from power and retook the Kingship, however he was now only King of Thomond, not the whole of Munster. He would die a year later in 1119 at Lismore. Toirdelbach had successfully divided Munster, and a year later he annexed the Ua Briain homeland of County Clare into the Kingdom of Connacht, leading to the further decline of the Ua Briain dynasty. Toirdelbach had now defeated and partitioned the Kingdom of Munster, and gained the submission of several other kings, and notably ended the Ua Briain's hold of the High Kingship which had lasted since 1002. In 1120 he celebrated the Oneach Titleann, an event meant to signify one's holding of the High Kingship of Ireland. However, this attracted the attention of Domnall mac Lochlainn of Ulster. The two kings met at Athlone where they agreed to a \\"false peace\\". Although Mac Lochlainn remained a threat to Toirdelbach he died in 1121, leaving Toirdelbach the most powerful man in Ireland. He immediately subdued unrest in Munster, causing the \\"people to cry aloud\\".  Innovation and political strategies  Toirdelbhach spent much of his career modernising and improving various aspects of Ireland, particularly in his home province of Connacht. Tairrdelbach constructed Dún Gaillimhe in 1124, for use as a fort and naval base, from which the King's fleets could attack all along the west coast of Ireland. A small settlement grew up around this fort and eventually this developed into Galway city. Although the town was destroyed or burned many times over the next few centuries it continued to grow into a prosperous city. He also created a new supply of water for settlements in eastern Connacht when he constructed a six-mile long canal which redirected the River Suck around a castle and towards nearby towns and villages. The route of this damn probably began near the modern town of Ballinasloe which was built on the river later. A political strategy often utilised successfully by Toirdelbhach was the appointment of relatives or loyal nobles as rulers or governors of towns, cities and other lesser regions or kingdoms. This allowed him to keep control of every area in the country and avoid rebellions or alliances against him. This can be seen in 1126 when Toirdelbhach appointed one of his sons, Conchobhair, as king of Laigin (Leinster) and the city-state of Dublin. Toirdelbhach realized the political and military importance of Dublin as the city had become more or less the capital of the country. It was also one of the main trading ports of the country. Therefore, control of Dublin was crucial to a successful High Kingship of Ireland. Conchobhair would also be given the Kingship of the province of Mide (Meath) later in 1143, however this move would backfire when he was assassinated a year later. In the year 1129, Toirdelbach reputedly built the first stone castle in Ireland, on the River Shannon in Athlone. Toirdelbach would build several more of these throughout Connacht, notably in Dún Gallimhe, Dún Mór and Ballinasloe, strengthening the defenses of the province. Athlone was a strategic location as it guarded one of the few crossings over the Shannon and guarded the area from any invasions via ships sailing up or down the river, especially from Munster whom Toirdelbhach was involved in an ongoing war with at the time. Toirdelbach was also known to have constructed or rebuilt several churches, cathedrals and monasteries, notably the Cong Abbey. This increased his power as he would often have the Catholic Church on his side in any political or military conflicts later in his career which was crucial given to importance of religion in Ireland at the time, though notably the church protected the King's son Ruadhrí from Toirdelbach after failed rebellions against him in both 1136 and 1143. The Cross of Cong, made at the behest of Tairrdelbach was designed to be placed on top of a religious staff or crosier. It was made for the Cathedral church at Tuam. The cross was subsequently moved to Cong Abbey. He is also believed to have refounded Cong Abbey ca. 1135. Tairrdelbach's successful and innovative reign as High King of Ireland has been summed up as follows: > \\"[he] was fifty years King of Connacht, one of the longest reigns of any > European monarch. He dominated Irish politics .. leading armies and navies > all over Éire ... subjugating entire kingdoms. A superb military commander > by any standards, his victory at Móin Mór in 1151 was among the most > decisive in Irish history, inflicting 7000 enemy casualties ... An > innovative tyrant, his creation of castles was novel in Éire ... as was his > apparent wish to introduce male primogeniture ... Commercial and political > networks connected him with fellow-rulers in Britain, Francia, and > Scandinavia. He reorganised lordships and kingdoms as suited him, carving > out a well-defended personal domain within Connacht, an imperium that he > would have span all Éire. Dún Mór was its caput, Tuaim Dá Ghualann the seat > of its archbishop, and Dún Gaillimhe its main port - military and merchant. > Quite an achievement for what is perceived as the 'timeless' western > 'fringe' of twelfth-century Europe, but was a dynamic society ruled as > aggressively as those in 'feudal' Europe.\\" (Martyn, 2016, p. 35)  Rebellion and heirs  Since Toirdelbach's accession to the High Kingship, his long designated heir had been Conchobar Ua Conchobair, who was Toirdelbach's Tánaiste, and whom he had appointed as his governor of the Kingdom of Laigin (Leinster) and city–state of Dublin within it, and later the province and kingdom of Mide. However, many of Toirdelbach's twenty other sons were very discontented with this situation. Two of them, Ruadhrí and Aedh, staged a rebellion against Toirdelbach in 1136 at a low point in the High King's fortunes. They were defeated by Toirdelbhach and Aedh was captured and blinded– however Ruadhrí escaped punishment by fleeing to an Archbishop, who protected him from the King. As Toirdelbach did not want any tension between himself and the Catholic church in Ireland, eventually the family briefly reconciled before Ruadhrí again rebelled against his father in the year 1143, and was defeated yet again. This time, he was captured and imprisoned by Toirdelbhach, however the archbishop again intervened by preventing the King from punishing Ruadhrí. Ruadhrí was released after a year in prison. However it was at this point, in the year 1144, that Conchobar, the heir to the throne, was assassinated while governing the kingdom of Mide. He was killed by a Meath lord or noble who had deemed him unfit or unworthy to govern the province. Toirdelbach did not make the same mistake twice or risk the life of another of his sons and instead divided the kingdom of Meath between three kings loyal to him; modern County Westmeath was given to the Northern Uí Néill, and 'East Meath' was divided between the Ua Ruaircs of Breifne (modern counties Leitrim and Cavan) and the third are was given to the King of Leinster. Toirdelbhach selected another son, Domhnall Mór mac Tairrdelbach, to be his Tánaiste and heir to the throne of Connacht and Ireland. Ruadhrí however, attempted a new approach in securing the Kingship by instead attempting to gain his father's favour. He conducted raids against the Ua Ruaircs (O'Rourkes) in the late 1140s, and was also involved in the capture of one of Toirdelbach nephews who was rebelling against him. He was also involved in raids against the O'Briens of Thomond in the prelude to the battle of Mhóin Mór. Meanwhile, Domhnall Mór was beginning to fall out of favour with Toirdelbach and his fate was sealed later when he was arrested. This secured Ruadhrí's position as sole heir to the throne. Ruadhrí became the Tánaiste and succeeded Toirdelbach as king following his death.  Later reign and battles  Battle of Móin Mór Despite giving hostages to Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn in 1150, and thereby ceasing to be King of Ireland, Tairrdelbach was still capable of active overlordship in southern Ireland. In 1151 he and his allies - King Diarmaid Mac Murchadha of Leinster, Maelseachlainn son of Murchadh Ó Maelseachlainn of the Kingdom of Mide, King Tighearnán Ó Ruairc of the Kingdom of Breifne - met the forces of King Toirdhealbhach Ó Briain of Thomond at Móin Mór near Glanmire. In what was one of the most decisive battles ever fought in Ireland, Tairrdelbach defeated the forces of Toirdelbach Ó Briain, killing \\"7000\\" enemy soldiers. The Annals of Tigernach describe the battle and victory of Toirdelbach Ua Conchobhair here: > \\"Until sand of sea and stars of heaven are numbered, no one will reckon all > the sons of the kings and chiefs and great lords of the men of Munster that > were killed there, so that of the three battalions of Munster that had come > thither, none escaped save only one shattered battalion.\\" This event, along with the partition of Munster earlier in Toirdelbach's reign, practically destroyed the power of the Ua Briain dynasty in Munster, and secured Tairrdelbach as the undisputed High King of Ireland and as overlord of Munster and Connacht. Toirdelbach's military forces and his excellent capabilities as a commander were a crucial aspect of his success as High King, similar to the reign of his great‐grandfather, King Brian Boru. Naval battle off Inishowen In the year 1156, Toirdelbhach organised a massive fleet gathered from all over western Connacht including men and ships from Dún Gaillimhe, Clew Bay on the coast of County Mayo (likely the seafaring Uí Mháille (O'Malley) clan and Connemara in western County Galway among others. The fleet was commanded by one of Toirdelbach's admirals, as by now the High King himself was almost seventy years of age. This fleet sailed north to plunder the lands of the O'Donnell Dynasty in Tír Chonaill (County Donegal) which was then part of the Northern Uí Néill, and went as far north as Inis Eoin (the Inishowen Peninsula). The Northern Uí Néill were alarmed by these attacks on the province of Ulster and decided to take action to assist the O'Donnells. Muircherteach Mac Lochlainn (who would later succeed Toirdelbach as High King of Ireland), who was a member of the Cenel Eoghain branch of the Ui Néill Dynasty, decided to request the assistance of the Viking Norse-Gaels who inhabited the Norse Kingdom of the Isles in the modern Hebrides and Western Isles of Scotland. The Norse-Gaels were excellent sailors and possessed a large and advanced naval force. Mac Lochlainn sent a representative to request assistance in defeating Toirdelbach's fleet, which was granted. The Vikings, under the command of a man by the name of Mac Scelling, sailed from western Scotland and the two fleets met in a battle off the peninsula of Inishowen. According to the Annals of the Four Masters, the battle lasted all day from the morning until late in the evening. The Annals state that the battle was \\"fiercely and spiritedly\\" fought and that there was a \\"great slaughter\\" and a great number of the High King's sailors were killed. However, the Irish fleet prevailed and the Norse-Gaels were slaughtered. Many of them abandoned ship and were subsequently captured by the Irish fleet. The Norse commander, Mac Scelling, apparently lost his teeth in the battle, but survived.  Death and Legacy  Toirdelbach Ua Conchobhair died in the year 1156. His reign had lasted 50 years, one of the longest in Ireland and Europe up to that point in history. He was succeeded as King of Connacht by his son Ruadhrí mac Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobhair, who had previously been his Tánaiste. He was succeeded as High King of Ireland by Muircherteach mac Lochlainn of the Northern Uí Néill, who would reign for ten years before being assassinated by his own nobles in the year 1166. He was initially interred at the Cong Abbey, the very monastery he had rebuilt earlier in his reign. However he was later buried in Clonmacaoise, where many members of the ruling Ua Conchobhair royal bloodline would be buried. Toirdelbach's reforms, advances and military prowess in Ireland would be remembered for many years as arguably the greatest King of Ireland since the reign of his great-great-grandfather Brian Boru. One of Toirdelbach's twenty sons, Ruadhrí, would become High King of Ireland following the death of Muircherteach mac Lochlainn, despite him rebelling against his father earlier in his life. He became High King of Ireland completely unopposed in the year 1166, and was crowned in Dublin. He would enjoy a period of relative peace in his High Kingship during the period of 1166–1169, however Ireland would again be thrown into conflict when the Anglo–Norman invasion of Ireland occurred in 1169. This would begin eight hundred years of conflict and political tension with England and later, Britain. Wives and children Tairrdelbach had the following known wives: * Caillech Dé Ní Eidin * Órfhlaith Ní Mailshechlainn, died 1115 * Mór Ní Lochlainn, died 1122 * Tailltiu Ní Mailshechlainn, sister of Órfhlaith, died 1127 * Derbforgaill Ní Lochlainn, died 1151. * Dubhcobhlach Ní Maíl Ruanaid, died 1168. Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh, writing in 1649, wrote the following account of Tairrdelbach's family (219.16 – 220.13, pp. 486–489): > \\" Toirdhealbhach Mor s.

The Gauntlet began in November 1975, with its original location was in Ward's West Hollywood home, but on the evening of Friday, November 17, 1978 it celebrated the grand opening of its first commercial location at 8720 Santa Monica Blvd. (also in West Hollywood). Eventually, Gauntlet opened stores in San Francisco, New York City, and Seattle, as well as a franchise in Paris. The Gauntlet's clientele originated from the gay S&M; communities of Southern California and Northern California and during the years that Ward ran his business from his home, many Gauntlet customers came from a group of gay Los Angeles men known as the T&P; Group (for Tattooing & Piercing). The Gauntlet became known as a fashionable location for body piercing and its customer base grew beyond its original roots. At its heyday, The Gauntlet operated a strong mail order business for piercing jewelry and manufactured its own jewelry. Eventually, manufacturing operations were contracted out to other companies. Not only did The Gauntlet manufacture jewelry, Ward and his team developed a number of the types of body jewelry in use today. This included coining the terms \\"barbell\\", \\"circular barbell\\", and \\"captive bead ring\\". The work done by Ward and others at this studio set the standard for the body piercings most commonly practiced in modern commercial settings. In addition to selling body jewelry and related equipment, The Gauntlet published a periodical called PFIQ, or Piercing Fans International Quarterly. Originally a mostly black and white newsletter, PFIQ evolved into a full-color glossy with photos, artwork, stories and tips related to body piercing. During its years of publication, PFIQ was the principal source for information on body piercing. A related publication, Pin Pals, was a newsletter in which pierced people could place classified personal advertisements. Eventually, The Gauntlet experienced financial difficulties and the illness of Jim Ward further contributed to its woes. After a run of over twenty years, The Gauntlet closed its doors in late 1998. Gauntlet Master Piercers Beginning in 1992, several of the Gauntlet body piercers were awarded the certification of Senior and Master Piercer. Many of these individuals went on to become highly influential in the body piercing community, training later generations of body piercers, owning their own stores and evolving the craft to suit the needs of their clients, keeping up with sterility standards as well as jewelry trends. * Elayne Angel – the first person certified as a Master Piercer. * Michaela Grey – Director of the Gauntlet Piercing Seminars and later founder of the Association of Professional Piercers. * Dan Kopka – Trained many of the piercers who worked at the Gauntlet New York City studio. * Mark Seitchik – Long time piercer at the Gauntlet San Francisco studio and later manager at the New York studio. * Paul King – Long time piercer at the Gauntlet in San Francisco and Los Angeles and later owner of Cold Steel America, a body piercing studio in San Francisco. *Fakir Musafar – Introduced to Jim Ward by a mutual friend in the early 1970s, Fakir became heavily involved with Jim's fledgling company, Gauntlet. Fakir was integral to the content of PFIQ, a magazine published by the Gauntlet.

The name of the village, occasionally given as \\"Las Dos Erres\\", literally means \\"two Rs\\", originating from two brothers called Ruano who received the original land grant. On 6 December 1982, during the de facto presidency of General Efraín Ríos Montt, over 200 people were killed in Dos Erres by commandos working as government forces as a part of the government's scorched earth policy, in which up to 200,000 indigenous and Mayan people died. In December 2011, President Álvaro Colom made a formal apology for the massacre on behalf of the Guatemalan government and months later four soldiers were sentenced to 6,060 years prison for their part in the massacre. In March 2012, a fifth soldier, Pedro Pimentel Rios, was further sentenced to 6,060 years in prison for his participation in the events. Jorge Vinicio Sosa Orantes, \\"one of the lieutenants\\" of the commandos, was found guilty in Fall 2013 of immigration fraud in a court in California. The events of December 1982 In October 1982, guerrillas ambushed an army convoy near Palestina, in the vicinity of Dos Erres. They killed 21 soldiers and took 19 rifles. On 4 December, a contingent of 58 Kaibiles (the elite special forces commandos of the Guatemalan Army) was flown into the area. The following day, they received orders to disguise themselves as guerrillas, deploy to Dos Erres and kill the inhabitants, who were considered guerrilla sympathizers. Dressed as guerrillas, the Kaibiles arrived in the hamlet at 02:30 hrs on 6 December. They forced the inhabitants out of their homes, corralling the men in the schoolhouse and the women and children in the hamlet's two churches. A subsequent search uncovered no sign of weapons or guerrilla propaganda. At 06:00, officers consulted superiors by radio, then informed the commandos they would be \\"vaccinating\\" the inhabitants after breakfast. In the early afternoon, the Kaibiles separated out the children, and began killing them. They raped women and girls, and ripped the fetuses out of pregnant women. They bashed the smallest children's heads against walls and trees, and killed the older ones with hammer blows to the head. A baby was the first to be killed, by dumping the baby live into a deep 4 meter well, along with the rest of the bodies then after. Then the commandos interrogated the men and women one by one, raped some of the women again, then shot or bashed them with the hammer, and dumped them in the well. The massacre continued throughout 7 December. On the morning of 8 December, as the Kaibiles were preparing to leave, another 15 persons, among them children, arrived in the hamlet. With the well already full, they took the newcomers to a location half an hour away, then shot all but two of them. They kept two teenage girls for the next few days, raping them repeatedly and finally strangling them. Only one person survived this massacre, a small child who managed to escape.  Judicial proceedings  In 1994 a case was presented in Guatemala to investigate and bring to trial those responsible for the massacre. However, the case remained paralyzed in Guatemala's justice system and showed no signs of progress. In 2000, President Alfonso Portillo admitted government responsibility for the massacre. He acknowledged the deaths of 226 victims at the hands of state agents, humbly asked for forgiveness on behalf of the state, and presented survivors' groups with a cheque totaling US$1.82 million. In 2009, the IACHR held that the amnesty law of 1996 did not apply to the most serious crimes committed during the civil war.Matt McAllester, US rounds up Guatemalans accused of war crimes, Global Post, 5 mai 2010 This was followed by investigations in the United States against people suspected of involvement in the massacre. In May 2010, Gilberto Jordan, naturalized American and former member of the Kaibiles special forces, was accused of involvement in the massacre and arrested in Florida by U.S. Immigration and Customs officers.Former Guatemalan Soldier Arrested for Alleged Role in Dos Erres Massacre, National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book n°316, 7 mai 2010 On 16 September 2010, after his role in the massacre was established in a Miami court, Jordan was convicted for naturalization fraud and is serving a 10-year prison sentence in FCI Miami. He is expected to be released on 29 March 2019. In January 2011, Jorge Vinicio Orantes Sosa, another former Kaibil member suspected to be involved in the massacre, was arrested in Alberta on charges of lying to immigration authorities. In September 2011, US authorities formally requested Sosa's extradition from Canada to the United States to face charges of making a false statement and unlawful procurement of citizenship, with regards to his arrival from Guatemala to the United States a few years after the massacre. Sosa, who holds both Canadian and American citizenship is also wanted by Guatemalan authorities. On 21 September 2012, Canada extradited Sosa to the United States, where he is standing trial. On 25 July 2011, the office of Attorney General Claudia Paz y Paz began its trial in Guatemala City against four former soldiers of the Kaibiles special forces accused of participating in the massacre. On 2 August 2011, a court found the four soldiers, Manuel Pop, Reyes Collin Gualip, Daniel Martínez Hernández and Lieutenant Carlos Carías guilty of the massacre.Prensa Libre. (2 August 2011).

La ONU expresa satisfacción por la sentencia emitida contra cuatro ex militares On 12 March 2012, Pedro Pimentel Rios was sentenced to a symbolic 6,060 years in prison for his part in the massacre. On 25 May 2012, the American public radio show This American Life aired an episode entitled \\"What Happened at Dos Erres\\" which covered the story of a survivor of the massacre, Oscar Ramirez. It was based on a series of articles by ProPublica, which later served as the basis for a 2017 documentary called \\"Finding Oscar.\\" A sixth former soldier, Santos Lopez, was convicted of killing 171 people during the massacre. He was sentenced in November 2018 to a symbolic 5,160 years in prison. Among those who testified against him was Ramiro Osorio Cristales, who was 5 years old when his family was murdered during the massacre. Lopez subsequently kidnapped and raised Cristales in an abusive household for the next 13 years. Cristales eventually escaped and sought asylum in Canada, where he currently resides. On 3 March 2020, Gilberto Jordan, 64, was removed by officers with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) in Miami. Gilberto Jordan, arrived in Guatemala escorted by ERO officers. Upon arrival, Jordan was immediately turned over to Guatemalan law enforcement officials.

History  Founding and growth = The first Potbelly Restaurant, in Lincoln Park, Chicago. Potbelly Sandwich Shop is a sandwich and food store that was founded in 1977 by Peter Hastings. The original store is located at 2264 North Lincoln Avenue in Chicago, in a retail space that was previously an antique store called Hindsight, also owned by Hastings. Many of the items that decorated the restaurant were taken from the former antique store including the namesake Potbelly stove. In 1996, Bryant Keil purchased the original store. Keil quickly expanded the company, The second store was opened in 1997, and he expanded Potbelly to over 300 stores in several states and the District of Columbia. Investors include Maveron (Founded by Starbucks Founder, Howard Schultz) and American Securities. As of August 2019, approximately 10% of the chains 450+ locations were franchisees. = Paycheck Protection Program loan= During the Covid-19 crisis, Potbelly Sandwich Shop applied for and accepted $10 million under the PPP (Paycheck Protection Program) which the United States government created for small businesses to maintain workers through the Covid-19 crisis. On April 14th, 2020, the company was awarded $10 million in PPP Loans from the federal government. Protesters began picketing April 20, 2020 at the Chicago headquarters demanding the return of the funds. Potbelly Sandwich Shop announced on April 25th, 2020 that they would return the $10 million loan. = IPO = In August 2013, Potbelly filed an initial public offering with US regulators to raise up to $75 million. Shares in the company began trading on the NASDAQ Stock Market on October 4, 2013. = Expansion = A view inside the first Potbelly Restaurant seating area On November 5, 2007, a new Potbelly store in Glen Ellyn, Illinois became the first to feature a drive-through. A second drive-through store was added shortly thereafter in Waukegan, Illinois. In 2011, Potbelly opened two franchise stores in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates; these are the first international Potbelly locations. Potbelly opened its first European store at Westfield Stratford City, London, in July 2015 and its first Canadian store in Toronto in October 2016. By August 2017, 60% of Potbelly's business came from lunch. It had 424 owned stores and 54 franchised stores. Early that month, Potbelly announced it was considering putting itself for sale. In December 2017, Potbelly opened its first franchise in India with a new location in Cyber City, Gurgaon. The company signed a multi-franchise agreement with India's Kwals Group, with plans to open five franchises in the country by the end of 2018 and 20 locations over the next five years. As part of its 2019 Q2 earnings call, chief financial officer Thomas Fitzgerald made the following announcement; “As part of our strategy to hone our focus on the turnaround of our core business and exit international markets, this quarter we closed six international shops, leaving one remaining international shop, which is in the Middle East, We expect to close that shop in the second half of this year.”  Menu  A location in Eden Prairie, Minnesota Potbelly's menu features a variety of sandwiches that are all served hot. Potbelly began offering salads in February 2007, and the menu also includes soup, shakes, malts, smoothies, and cookies.

As a result, most complications result from fracture, deformity, functional impairment, and pain. Disease occurs along a broad clinical spectrum ranging from asymptomatic, incidental lesions, to severe disabling disease. Disease can affect one bone (monostotic), multiple (polyostotic), or all bones (panostotic) and may occur in isolation or in combination with café au lait skin macules and hyperfunctioning endocrinopathies, termed McCune–Albright syndrome. More rarely, fibrous dysplasia may be associated with intramuscular myxomas, termed Mazabraud's syndrome. Fibrous dysplasia is very rare, and there is no known cure. Fibrous dysplasia is not a form of cancer. Presentation Fibrous dysplasia of the right zygomatic bone (left). Corresponding T2-weighted MRI (left) and CT (right) of the same patient. Fibrous dysplasia is a mosaic disease that can involve any part or combination of the craniofacial, axillary, and/or appendicular skeleton. The type and severity of the complications therefore depend on the location and extent of the affected skeleton. The clinical spectrum is very broad, ranging from an isolated, asymptomatic monostotic lesion discovered incidentally, to severe disabling disease involving practically the entire skeleton and leading to loss of vision, hearing, and/or mobility. Individual bone lesions typically manifest during the first few years of life and expand during childhood. The vast majority of clinically significant bone lesions are detectable by age 10 years, with few new and almost no clinically significant bone lesions appearing after age 15 years. Total body scintigraphy is useful to identify and determine the extent of bone lesions, and should be performed in all patients with suspected fibrous dysplasia. Children with fibrous dysplasia in the appendicular skeleton typically present with limp, pain, and/or pathologic fractures. Frequent fractures and progressive deformity may lead to difficulties with ambulation and impaired mobility. In the craniofacial skeleton, fibrous dysplasia may present as a painless “lump” or facial asymmetry. Expansion of craniofacial lesions may lead to progressive facial deformity. In rare cases, patients may develop vision and/or hearing loss due to compromise of the optic nerves and/or auditory canals, which is more common in patients with McCune-Albright syndrome associated growth hormone excess. Fibrous dysplasia commonly involves the spine, and may lead to scoliosis, which in rare instances may be severe. Untreated, progressive scoliosis is one of the few features of fibrous dysplasia that can lead to early fatality. Bone pain is a common complication of fibrous dysplasia. It may present at any age, but most commonly develops during adolescence and progresses into adulthood. Bone marrow stromal cells in fibrous dysplasia produce excess amounts of the phosphate-regulating hormone fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23), leading to loss of phosphate in the urine. Patients with hypophosphatemia may develop rickets/osteomalacia, increased fractures, and bone pain. Micrograph of fibrous dysplasia (right) juxtaposed with unaffected bone (left). H&E; stain. Pathophysiology Fibrous dysplasia is a mosaic disease resulting from post- zygotic activating mutations of the GNAS locus at 20q13.2-q13.3, which codes for the α subunit of the Gs G-coupled protein receptor. In bone, constitutive Gsα signaling results in impaired differentiation and proliferation of bone marrow stromal cells. Proliferation of these cells causes replacement of normal bone and marrow with fibrous tissue. The bony trabeculae are abnormally thin and irregular, and often likened to Chinese characters (bony spicules on biopsy). Fibrous dysplasia is not hereditary, and there has never been a case of genetic inheritance from parent to child. Diagnosis On x-ray, fibrous dysplasia appears as bubbly lytic lesions, or a ground glass appearance. Computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans may be used to determine how extensively bones are affected. CT can better demonstrate the typical \\"ground glass\\" appearance, which is a highly specific radiological finding, while MRI can show cystic areas with fluid contents. A bone scan uses radioactive tracers, which are injected into your bloodstream. The damaged parts of bones take up more of the tracer, which show up more brightly on the scan. A biopsy, which uses a hollow needle to remove a small piece of the affected bone for laboratory analysis, can diagnose fibrous dysplasia definitely. Treatment Treatment in fibrous dysplasia is mainly palliative, and is focused on managing fractures and preventing deformity. There are no medications capable of altering the disease course. Intravenous bisphosphonates may be helpful for treatment of bone pain, but there is no clear evidence that they strengthen bone lesions or prevent fractures. Surgical techniques that are effective in other disorders, such as bone grafting, curettage, and plates and screws, are frequently ineffective in fibrous dysplasia and should be avoided. Intramedullary rods are generally preferred for management of fractures and deformity in the lower extremities. Progressive scoliosis can generally be managed with standard instrumentation and fusion techniques. Surgical management in the craniofacial skeleton is complicated by frequent post-operative FD regrowth, and should focus on correction of functional deformities. Prophylactic optic nerve decompression increases the risk of vision loss and is contraindicated. Managing endocrinopathies is a critical component of management in FD. All patients with fibrous dysplasia should be evaluated and treated for endocrine diseases associated with McCune–Albright syndrome. In particular untreated growth hormone excess may worsen craniofacial fibrous dysplasia and increase the risk of blindness. Untreated hypophosphatemia increases bone pain and risk of fractures.

At above sea level, it is the highest place in Europe that can be reached by aerial tramway or gondola lift, as well as by any other means of transport. The Klein Matterhorn is part of the Breithorn massif and overlooks on its south side the almost equally high flat glacier named Breithorn Plateau, just north of the international border with Italy. The name \\"Klein Matterhorn\\" is a reference to its much larger neighbour, the Matterhorn, which lies away across the Theodul Pass. The Klein Matterhorn, with the adjacent ski-lifts to the slightly higher Gobba di Rollin, is also a year-round ski area, marketed as \\"Matterhorn Glacier Paradise\\", and part of the international ski area between Zermatt and Breuil-Cervinia. Fast ascents to a height above will frequently lead to headaches or other symptoms of altitude sickness with sensitive people. Construction of the Klein Matterhorn cable car lift Even before the construction license application was filed, the building promoter had to negotiate with the Swiss Alpine Club and with the Swiss Nature Conservation Society. These discussions resulted in two large natural reserve zones (the \\"Matterhorn\\" region and the \\"Monte Rosa\\" region). The third area (the \\"Schwarzsee-Theodul Glacier-Klein Matterhorn\\" region) was designated as a tourist zone. Cable car between Furi and Trockener Steg. The Klein Matterhorn is not visible from here Licensing was further delayed until 1969 by the citizens of Zermatt filing a complaint to the governing council of the Canton of Valais. In December 1970, the Swiss government finally gave permission for the cable way, but progress was further delayed until 1973 by objections from environmentalists. Eventually, on 17 December 1973, the Federal Council rejected objections and granted a construction license. The next major obstacle proved to be the recruitment of a work force to build the lift system. At altitudes of above sea level, worker productivity would be reduced by up to 50% compared to normal levels, and workers would be required to live for weeks on end within the camps. The construction of this cable car started in August 1976 at all three construction sites: the valley terminal, the three tower sites and the mountain terminal. Creation of the mountain terminal was a difficult undertaking. Some of concrete were used in the mountain station, all of which had to be transported there by helicopter in specially insulated tanks, mixed with warm water and 2% anti-freeze. Weather conditions at the work site ( above sea level) in high mountain terrain were extreme: temperatures falling to , snowfalls, and high winds of over . In the summer of 1977 the track, hand and counter cables totalling in length and weighing to were dragged from Schweigmatten to Trockener Steg, a massive undertaking in itself. It took several weeks to cover the distance of , with a vertical altitude of almost and to rewind the cables on their reels. On December 1978, all four track cables were installed, and all remaining operations were completed by the spring of 1979. In the fall of 1979, the two 100 passenger cabins were flown from the village of Täsch to the valley terminal, attached to the hanger frames with the carriages lifted onto the track cables, with operations starting on 23 December, the start of the winter season.Encyclopédie du Valais The Cable car was built by Von Roll LTD Bern Switzerland. Current operation View from the summit towards the Breithorn View from the summit towards the ski area (Breithorn Plateau) The Klein Matterhorn is at the end of a multi-stage cable car journey from Zermatt, via Furi and Trockener Steg. The last station lies at a height of , on the north side of the peak. A tunnel connects it with the Breithorn Plateau on the south side. There is also a panoramic view platform on the top which can be reached by elevator—located midway through the tunnel—followed by a climb up stairs. The Ice Cave (\\"Glacier Grotto\\") is just outside the southern entrance with a view into the glacier below. As of 2005, over 14 million passengers had visited since completion, an average of 560,000 per year. The carriages were refurbished in 2005. The station is a high-alpine environment, and in the thin air one must use caution when making any physical effort. If possible, take time to acclimatise on the way to the Klein Matterhorn. There are plenty of warnings about this on the way up. The lift serves the largest and highest summer-ski area in Europe. During summer months one can find many professional, as well as beginner, skiers here. Access to the ski slopes is via a tunnel blasted straight through the mountain. The Klein Matterhorn is a starting point to several summits that can be reached within a few hours. These include the Breithorn and its subsidiary peaks, Pollux and Castor. Plans On December 9, 2005, the ZBAG (Zermatt Bergbahnen AG, the owner of this station) announced plans to significantly expand the facilities at the Klein Matterhorn. They had ordered studies from five large Swiss architectural firms stating some of the following demands: new heating-, water-, waste- and electricity-installations, new toilets, shop and cafeteria, restaurant, mountain cabin (40 beds, SAC (Schweizer Alpen-Club) style), underground access to the gletscher palast (ice cave) and spare room for 2 cableways: one from Trockener Steg (3-cable gondola) and one from Testa Grigia (double cable car). Additionally: a private investor (Heinz Julen) launched the idea of a hotel. Official press announcement (in German) It was announced in July 2006 the winning design for this construction was to consist of a pyramid of glass, with an observation platform at 4,000 meters with sky lifts on the outer wall to whisk passengers to the \\"new summit\\". Zermatt Mountain Cableways seem intent on marketing the construction as \\"the newest 4,000+ meter peak in the Alps\\".

As of 2017, Furman has set more than 600 official Guinness Records and currently holds 226 records, thus holding the Guinness world record for the most Guinness world records. His most recent record is 31 watermelons sliced on his stomach in one minute. He has been breaking records since 1979. Life and recordsEarly life= Furman was born in 1954 in Brooklyn, New York. He was fascinated with the Guinness Book of World Records as a child but never thought he could ever break a record since he was very unathletic. That all changed when, as a teenager, he became interested in spirituality and in 1970 became a devout follower of the spiritual leader Sri Chinmoy. Sri Chinmoy inspired Furman to participate in a 24-hour bicycle race in New York City's Central Park in 1978. With only two weeks' training, Furman tied for third place, cycling . Around this time, he changed his first name to Ashrita (\\"protected by God\\" in Sanskrit). =First record= In 1979, Furman set his first official record by doing 27,000 jumping jacks. In 1986, Furman invented and set the record for underwater pogo stick jumping and introduced it on Good Morning America on April Fools' Day. =Records around the world= Furman has managed a health food store in Jamaica, Queens, New York City, New York since 1982. He is also a tour manager for his meditation group and is therefore able to travel extensively. As of 2014, Furman has set records in 40 countries. He completed his goal of breaking a record in all seven continents when he set the mile hula hoop record at Uluru (also known as Ayers Rock) in the Australian desert in 2003. Furman has also set records at such famous landmarks as the Egyptian pyramids (distance pool cue balancing), Stonehenge (standing on a Swiss ball), the Eiffel Tower (most sit-ups in an hour), the Great Wall of China (hopping on a kangaroo ball), Borobudur (Fastest time to run a mile while balancing a milk bottle on the head) and Angkor Wat (jumping rope on a pogo stick). While in China, Furman broke the record for running 8 km (4.97 mi) on stilts in the fastest time (39 min. 56 sec.), a record which had stood since 1982. =Creating new records= Furman has also been a pioneer in setting records in several new activities including landrowing. Using a converted indoor rower with wheels and brakes, Furman rowed in 16 days in Bali in 1991. Furman also developed the sport of gluggling, underwater juggling, which he did for 48 minutes at Kelly Tarlton's Antarctic Encounter and Underwater World in Auckland, New Zealand in 2002 and distance sack racing, which Furman did for a mile while racing against a yak in Mongolia in 2007. On January 30, 2008, Furman unveiled his giant pencil – long, 22,000 pounds (with 4,000 solid pounds of Pennsylvania graphite). The pencil was built in three weeks as a birthday gift for teacher Sri Chinmoy on 27 August 2007. Longer than the pencil outside the Malaysia HQ of stationers Faber- Castell, it was transported from Queens, New York, to the City Museum in St. Louis. In April 2009 Furman became the first person to hold 100 Guinness World Records at once.

Cassian is noted for his role in bringing the ideas and practices of Christian monasticism to the early medieval West.

As a young adult he traveled to Palestine with an older friend Germanus, with whom he would spend much of the next twenty-five years. There they entered a hermitage near Bethlehem. After remaining in that community for about three years,Lake, p. 27. they journeyed to the desert of Scete in Egypt, which was rent by Christian struggles. There they visited a number of monastic foundations. Approximately fifteen years later, about 399, Cassian and Germanus faced the Anthropomorphic controversy provoked in letter form by Theophilus, Archbishop of Alexandria. Cassian noted that the majority of the monks received the message of their patriarch \\"with bitterness\\", and charged Theophilus with heresy for impugning the plain teaching of scripture. Following an unsuccessful journey to Alexandria to protest the matter, Cassian and Germanus fled with about 300 other Origenist monks. Cassian and Germanus went to Constantinople, where they appealed to the Patriarch of Constantinople, John Chrysostom, for protection. Cassian was ordained a deacon and became a member of the clergy attached to the patriarch while the struggles with the imperial family ensued. When the patriarch was forced into exile from Constantinople in 404, the Latin-speaking Cassian was sent to Rome to plead his cause before Pope Innocent I. While he was in Rome, Cassian accepted the invitation to found an Egyptian-style monastery in southern Gaul, near Marseilles. He may also have spent time as a priest in Antioch between 404 and 415. In any case, he arrived in Marseilles around 415. His foundation, the Abbey of St Victor, was a complex of monasteries for both men and women, one of the first such institutes in the West, and served as a model for later monastic development.Hassett, Maurice. \\"John Cassian.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 3 Jun. 2013 Cassian's achievements and writings influenced Benedict of Nursia, who incorporated many of the principles into his monastic rule, and recommended to his own monks that they read the works of Cassian. Since Benedict's rule is still followed by Benedictine, Cistercian, and Trappist monks, John Cassian's thought still exercises influence over the spiritual lives of thousands of men and women in the Latin Church. Cassian died in 435 at Marseille. Writings Cassian came very late into writing and did so only when a request was made by one or more important persons. His sources were the same as those of Evagrius Ponticus, but he added his own ideas, which were arranged in extensive collections. Evagrius was, however, the single most important influence on Cassian's ideas, due to his reverence for the \\"Origenist\\" monks (who also relied predominantly on Evagrius) of Nitria, Kellia, and Scetis, three early monastic centres in the desert of the northwestern Nile Delta. Around 420, at the request of Bishop Castor of Apt in Gallia Narbonensis, Cassian wrote two major spiritual works, the De institutis coenobiorum (Institutes of the Coenobia) and the Conlationes or Collationes patrum in scetica eremo (Conferences of the Desert Fathers). In these, he codified and transmitted the wisdom of the Desert Fathers of Egypt. The Institutes deal with the external organization of monastic communities, while the Conferences deal with \\"the training of the inner man and the perfection of the heart\\". The Institutes were meant to help Castor to establish a coenobium following the model of Egypt, in contrast to the existing monastic life in Gaul, which included the work of Martin of Tours. According to Hugh Feiss the Institutes are a counterweight to Sulpicius Severus’ Life of Martin and Dialogues, and are an attempt to put order into a movement Cassian regarded as chaotic. Cassian, who insists on manual work, had a higher opinion of and close ties with the monastery on the Island of Lerins, founded by Honoratus. In Books 1–4 of Institutions, Cassian discusses clothing, prayer and rules of monastic life. Books 5–12 are rules on morality, specifically addressing the eight vices – gluttony, lust, greed, hubris, wrath, envy, listlessness, and boasting – and what to do to cure these vices. In the Institutions, Cassian discusses a will that is more complex than the will at the heart of the Pelagian message. Willful monks are a contentious problem, and Cassian paid considerable attention to analyzing the will, treating the corrupt will, and chiefly subordinating even the good will for the good of the community and ultimately, the will of God. The Conferences, dedicated to Pope Leo, to the bishop of Frejus, and to the monk Helladius, summarize important conversations that Cassian had with elders from the monastery at Scetis about principles of the spiritual and ascetic life. This book addresses specific problems of spiritual theology and the ascetic life. It was later read in Benedictine communities after the evening meal, and from the Latin title, Collationes, comes the word collation in the sense of \\"light meal\\".Charles Earle Funk, Thereby Hangs a Tale: Stories of Curious Word Origins (Read Books, 2007: ), pp. 78-79.The New Oxford American Dictionary, 2nd ed. (Oxford University Press, 2005: ), p. 333. His books were written in Latin, in a simple, direct style. They were swiftly translated into Greek, which indicates the Eastern monks recognized him as one of their own. Spirituality The Desert ascetics of Egypt followed a three- step path to mysticism: Purgatio, Illuminatio, and Unitio. These stages correspond to the three ways of later Catholic theology. During the first level, Purgatio (in Greek, Catharsis), young monks struggled through prayer and ascetic practices to gain control of \\"the flesh\\"—specifically by purging their gluttony, lust and desire for possessions. This period of purgation, which often took many years, was intended to teach young monks that whatever strength they had to resist these desires (grace) came directly from the Holy Spirit. At this point, the Illuminatio (theoria in Greek) commenced. During this period the monks practiced the paths to holiness as revealed in the Gospel, identifying strongly with the Christ who taught the Sermon on the Mount (found in Matthew 5–7). Many monks took in visitors and students and tended the poor as much as their resources allowed. Many monks died never having moved past this period. The final stage was the Unitio (theosis in Greek), a period in which the soul of the monk was meant to bond with the Spirit of God in a union often described as the marriage of the Song of Solomon (also called the \\"Song of Songs\\" or the \\"Canticle of Canticles\\"). To find the solitude and peace that this level of mystical awareness demanded, elderly monks often fled into the deep desert or into remote forests. His asceticism, while rigorous, was tempered by common sense. Cassian says hospitality should override ascetical routine. Even the most contemplative of anchorites should entertain visitors. Both asceticism and ministry are aspects of the practical life. In his Conferences, Cassian recommended as \\"absolutely necessary for possessing the perpetual awareness of God\\" the formula in Psalm 70 (69) v. 2, \\"Deus, in adiutorium meum intende. Domine, ad adiuvandum me festina\\" (O God, incline unto my aid; O Lord, make haste to help me),Nova Vulgata, Psalmus 70 (69) He says of it: > Not without reason has this verse been selected out of the whole body of > Scripture. For it takes up all the emotions that can be applied to human > nature and with great correctness and accuracy it adjusts itself to every > condition and every attack. It contains an invocation of God in the face of > any crisis, the humility of a devout confession, the watchfulness of concern > and of constant fear, a consciousness of one's own frailty, the assurance > being heard, and confidence in a protection that is always present and at > hand, for whoever calls unceasingly on his protector is sure that he is > always present. It contains a burning love and charity, an awareness of > traps, and a fear of enemies. Seeing oneself surrounded by these day and > night, one confesses that one cannot be set free without the help of one's > defender. This verse is an unassailable wall, an impenetrable breastplate, > and a very strong shield for those who labour under the attack of > demons.John Cassian, The Conferences (Newman Press 1997 ), Tenth Conference, > X, 2-4 Benedict of Nursia praises Cassian's Conferences in his ruleRegula S.P.N. Benedicti, caput 73Birrell, Martin Birrell, \\"'HELP!' St John Cassian in The Liturgy & in Devotion\\", Pluscarden Abbey and use of this formula became part of the Liturgy of the Hours in the Western Church, in which all the canonical hours, including the minor hours, start with this versicle, which is omitted only if the hour begins with the Invitatory, the introduction to the first hour said in the day, whether it be the Office of Readings or Morning Prayer. Alphonsus Liguori also cites Cassian's recommendation to use this short prayer continually.Alphonsus Liguori, Treatise on Prayer (St Athanasius Press 2009 ), p. 39 In the West, Cassian's proposition that \\"the slightest glimmer of goodwill\\" could be attributed to the human drive was widely regarded as unacceptable in relation to the prosperity of the Augustinianism of the period (Conf. 13.7.1; cf Prosper of Aquitaine Contra Collatorem; Cassiodorus, Institutiones 1.29; Decretum Gelasianum V.7). In his Thirteenth Conference and in writings to the Monks of Lerins, Cassian qualifies this by saying the good will is \\"stirred\\" by God: > For when God sees us inclined to will what is good, He meets, guides, and > strengthens us: for \\"At the voice of thy cry, as soon as He shall hear, He > will answer thee;\\" and: \\"Call upon Me,\\" He says, \\"in the day of tribulation > and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify Me.\\" And again, if He finds > that we are unwilling or have grown cold, He stirs our hearts with salutary > exhortations, by which a good will is either renewed or formed in us. Cassian finds the will to be insufficient for spiritual progress, and traces this back to the initial sin of pride. Cassian illustrates advanced cases of the will's pathology in the Institutions, saying these problems began when man \\"believed himself capable of attaining the glory of the Godhead by his freedom of will and hard work.\\" To this end, Cassian believes the renunciate must conquer his will, overcome it, and even kill it. In regards to demons, Cassian noted that the earliest coenobites would ensure one monk was reciting a prayer, psalmody, or reading at all times, due to their belief that demons were especially prevalent at night. Cassian promotes David's evil spirit repulsing prayer at Ps. 35: 1-3, for demons actively oppose the virtuous life, and could be warded off with prayer. Accusations of SemipelagianismAs viewed by the Roman Catholic Church= His third book, On the Incarnation of the Lord, was a defense of orthodox doctrine against the views of Nestorius, and was written at the request of the Archdeacon of Rome, later Pope Leo I. In this book Cassian points out a link between Nestorianism which stresses the humanity of Jesus and Pelagianism which stresses human effort. Later theologians, however, labeled Cassian as \\"Semipelagian\\" because he stressed the role of the human will, as opposed to Augustine's stress on the totality of grace, in moving towards salvation. The ideas expressed by Cassian to which critics have pointed as examples of his alleged Semipelagianism are found in his Conferences, in book 3, the Conference of Abbot Paphnutius; book 5, the Conference of Abbot Serapion; and most especially in book 13, the Third Conference of Abbot Chaeremon. The view that Cassian propounded Semipelagianism has been disputed. Lauren Pristas, writes: \\"For Cassian, salvation is, from beginning to end, the effect of God's grace. It is fully divine. Salvation, however, is salvation of a rational creature who has sinned through free choice. Therefore, salvation necessarily includes both free human consent in grace and the gradual rehabilitation in grace of the faculty of free choice. Thus Cassian insists salvation is also fully human. His thought, however, is not Semi-Pelagian, nor do readers who submit to the whole corpus emerge Semi-Pelagians.\\"Lauren Pristas (1993), The Theological Anthropology of John Cassian, PhD dissertation, Boston College, And Augustine Casiday states that \\"for Cassian ... although sparks of goodwill may exist (which are not directly caused by God), they are totally inadequate and only direct divine intervention can ensure our spiritual progress\\".STUDIA HISTORIAE ECCLESIASTICAE May/Mei 2009 Volume XXXV No/Nr 1 The Latin Church condemned Semipelagianism in the local Council of Orange (529), but recognizes Cassian himself as a saint. It did not endorse Augustine entirelyEdwin Zackrison, In the Loins of Adam (iUniverse 2004 ), p. 73 and, while later Catholic theologians accepted Augustine's authority, they interpreted his views in the light of writers such as Cassian.Justo L. González, A History of Christian Thought (Abingdon Press 2010 ), vol. 2, p. 58 =As viewed by the Eastern Orthodox Church= Augustine Casiday states that Cassian \\"baldly asserts that God's grace, not human free will, is responsible for 'everything which pertains to salvation' - even faith.\\"Augustine Casiday, Tradition and Theology in St John Cassian (Oxford University Press 2007 ), p. 103 Some other Orthodox, who do not apply the term \\"Semi-Pelagian\\" to their theology, criticize the Roman Catholics for allegedly rejecting Cassian, whom they accept as fully orthodox,The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church (St. Vladimir's Seminary Press 1976 ) p. 198 and for holding, as, in Casiday's interpretation, that everything which pertains to salvation comes from God's grace, and so that even the human consent to God's justifying action is itself an effect of grace,\\"When Catholics say that persons cooperate in preparing for an accepting justification by consenting to God's justifying action, they see such personal consent as itself an effect of grace, not as an action arising from innate human abilities\\" This position of the Roman Catholic Church and of Cassian as interpreted by Casiday is attributed by Eastern Orthodox theologian Georges Florovsky also to the Eastern Orthodox Church, which, he says, \\"always understood that God initiates, accompanies, and completes everything in the process of salvation\\", rejecting instead the Calvinist idea of irresistible grace.The existential and ontological meaning of man's created existence is precisely that God did not have to create, that it was a free act of Divine freedom. But— and here is the great difficulty created by an unbalanced Christianity on the doctrine of grace and freedom— in freely creating man God willed to give man an inner spiritual freedom. In no sense is this a Pelagian or Semi-Pelagian position. The balanced synergistic doctrine of the early and Eastern Church, a doctrine misunderstood and undermined by Latin Christianity in general from Saint Augustine on— although there was always opposition to this in the Latin Church— always understood that God initiates, accompanies, and completes everything in the process of salvation. What it always rejected— both spontaneously and intellectually— is the idea of irresistible grace, the idea that man has no participating role in his salvation. The Ascetic Ideal and the New Testament: Reflections on the Critique of the Theology of the Reformation Georges Florovsky Neither Cassian nor any of his teachings have ever been directly or indirectly called into question or condemned by Eastern Orthodox, as they are considered a witness to the Orthodox position.Augustine's writings found their way to parts of the West Roman provinces. Saint John Cassian (circa 360-433), former ascetic in the deserts of Egypt and then deacon of the Patriarch of Constantinople Saint John Chrysostom, challenged Augustine's teaching about original sin and pre- destination without mentioning him. The teachings of Augustine on these points were condemned by the Council of Orange in 529.[ 18 ] Augustine's writings completely captured the 8th century Carolingian tradition which knew basically only Augustine until the 12th century. At that time the Franks acquired a translation of Saint John of Damascus' \\"Book on the Orthodox Faith\\" which they simply understood within their own Augustinian categories. By the 11th century the Franks had taken over all of Western Europe, except Spain, by either conquest or diplomacy. The Spanish Romans under Arab rule were still under the direct surveillance of the Roman Emperor of Constantinople New Rome. The Umayad Arabs of Spain and the Abbasid Arabs of Damascus and then Baghdad called their Roman Orthodox subjects Melkites, i.e. those who belong to the religion of the Roman Emperor in New Rome Constantinople. =In Cassian's writings= In The Book of Mystical Chapters, a compilation of sayings of the Church Fathers by renowned theologian and early church historian1\\\\. http://religion.columbia.edu/people/John%20McGuckin 2\\\\. https://utsnyc.edu/academics/faculty/john-anthony-mcguckin/ John Anthony McGuckin, Cassian is quoted as saying the following: =Other views= According to some scholars, Cassian is a prominent representative of a monastic movement in southern Gaul which, ca. 425, gave expression to the soteriological view that much later was called Semipelagianism.Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church: article \\"Semipelagianism\\" (Oxford University Press 2005 ) This emphasized the role of free will in that the first steps of salvation are in the power of the individual, without the need for divine grace. His thought has been described as a \\"middle way\\" between Pelagianism, which taught that the will alone was sufficient to live a sinless life, and the view of Augustine of Hippo, which emphasizes original sin and the absolute need for grace. For instance, Anglican priest and historian Owen Chadwick stated that Cassian held that man can come to God without the intervention of divine grace first; and the Presbyterian theologian B. B. Warfield called Cassian the leader of the monastics in southern Gaul who asserted that men begin their turning to God and that God assists that beginning.B.B. Warfield, \\"Introductory Essay on Augustin and the Pelagian Controversy\\" in Philip Schaff, Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: First Series, Volume V St. Augustine: Anti-Pelagian Writings (1887), p. xxi Influence The spiritual traditions of Cassian had an immeasurable effect on Western Europe. Many different western spiritualities, from that of Benedict of Nursia to that of Ignatius of Loyola, owe their basic ideas to Cassian. Pope Gregory I's teaching on the seven deadly sins comes from Cassian, as does much of his teaching on compunction and prayer. Philip Neri used to read Cassian to the laity and would frequently use his work as the starting point for his own addresses. He also influenced John Climacus and John of Damascus, as well as Saint Dominic, Francis de Sales, and John Henry Newman.\\"The saint whose guide on virtue was read every day by monks in the Middle Ages\\", Catholic Herald, 23 July 2012 Cassian's writings stress the role of prayer and personal asceticism in attaining salvation by contrast with Augustine's writings which stress the role of God's justice and grace (predestination) and take a more negative view of human effort. His teaching on overcoming the eight evil tendencies (See Books 5 to 12 of The Institutes) were the inspiration behind the way the Irish monks practised asceticism, as shown in the Irish Penitentials. The Institutes had a direct influence on organization of monasteries described in the Rule of Saint Benedict; Benedict also recommended that ordered selections of the Conferences be read to monks under his Rule. Moreover, the monastic institutions Cassian inspired kept learning and culture alive during the Early Middle Ages, and were often the only institutions that cared for the sick and poor. His works are excerpted in the Philokalia (Greek for \\"love of the beautiful\\"), the Eastern Orthodox compendium on mystical Christian prayer. Even modern thinkers are beholden to Cassian's thinking. Michel Foucault was fascinated by the rigorous way Cassian defined and struggled against the \\"flesh\\".Foucault engages extensively with Cassian in his 1979-1980 lecture series at the College de France, published as Du gouvernement des vivants (2012); On the Government of the Living (English translation, 2014) Perhaps because of investigations like these, Cassian's thought and writings are enjoying a recent popularity even in non-religious circles. Veneration Abbey of Saint Victor, Marseille, where his relics are placed He is a saint of the Eastern Orthodox Churches, with a feast day on 29 February, a date assigned also in the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA). Because this day occurs only once every four years on leap years, official church calendars often transfer his feast to another date (usually 28 February). The Roman Catholic Church also ranks him as a saint, with a feast day on 23 July. Like his contemporaries Augustine of Hippo and John Chrysostom, he was never formally canonized, a process that came into use several centuries after his death. Pope Urban V referred to him as sanctus (a saint) and he was included in the Gallican MartyrologySabine Baring-Gould, The Lives of the Saints (Baring-Gould), p.521 He is included also in the Roman Martyrology with a feast-day on 23 July.Martyrologium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2001 ), p. 385 In the Irish church, at the beginning of the ninth century, Cassian was commemorated on 25 November, as indicated in the Martyrology of Óengus: \\"Lasin nEoin Cassian assa érchain corann\\" (With John Cassian whose crown is very fair). Like the great majority of recognized saints of the church, he is not one of the saints in the General Roman Calendar, but the Archdiocese of Marseilles and some monastic orders celebrate his memorial on his feast day. Cassian's relics are kept in an underground chapel in the Monastery of Saint Victor in Marseilles. His head and right hand are in the main church there.

National Guardsmen opened fire on a group of unarmed students, killing four of them, at an average distance of about 345 ft (106 m). Krause was shot in the left side of her chest at about , from which she received a fatal wound. A subsequent autopsy found that a single rifle bullet entered and exited her upper left arm, and then entered the left side of her chest, fragmenting on impact and causing massive internal trauma. She died from her wounds later the same day. Background Krause was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the daughter of Doris Lillian (Levine) and Arthur Selwyn Krause. She had a younger sister, Laurel. Krause was Jewish. She was an alumna of John F. Kennedy High School in Silver Spring, Maryland.Raub, Deborah Fineblum (April 29, 1990). \\"Unlikely Martyr Brought the Discord Home\\".

Altogether, the Guardsmen fired 67 shots in 13 seconds. The other students killed in the shootings were Jeffrey Glenn Miller, Sandra Lee Scheuer and William Knox Schroeder. In addition, nine other students were wounded in the gunfire. The shootings led to protests and a national student strike, causing hundreds of campuses to close because of both violent and non-violent demonstrations. The Kent State campus remained closed for six weeks. Five days after the shootings, 100,000 people demonstrated in Washington, D.C. against the war. Krause's father became an outspoken advocate of the press for truth and justice about what occurred that day and fought it in the courts for nearly 10 years following the death of his daughter. In the end, the family of Allison Krause received a 'Statement of Regret' and $15,000 from the state of Ohio for the loss of Allison. In 2010, Krause's sister Laurel co-founded the Kent State Truth Tribunal 'KSTT' with Emily Kunstler. The tribunal was organized to uncover, record and preserve the testimonies of witnesses, participants and meaningfully involved individuals of the Kent State shootings of 1970. Showing his support, Michael Moore livecast every KSTT testimonial at his website. In all, three tribunals were held in 2010: May 1, 2, 3 and 4 in Kent, Ohio at the 40th anniversary of the shootings; with a west coast tribunal in San Francisco in August and an east coast tribunal in New York City in October 2010.

It is situated a short distance from the archaeological site of Tell Balata, which is thought to be the site of biblical Shechem.Horne, 1856, pp. 50-51/ The well currently lies within the complex of an Eastern Orthodox monastery of the same name, in the city of Nablus in the West Bank.Bromiley, 1982, p. 955.Hastings and Driver, 2004, pp. 535–537. Religious significance Jesus and the Samaritan woman at Jacob's Well Jewish, Samaritan, Christian, and Muslim traditions all associate the well with Jacob. The well is not specifically mentioned in the Old Testament, but states that when Jacob returned to Shechem from Paddan Aram, he camped \\"before\\" the city and bought the land on which he pitched his tent and erected an altar. Biblical scholars contend that the plot of land is the same one upon which Jacob's Well was constructed. Jacob's Well is mentioned by name once in the New Testament in a passage () which says that Jesus \\"came to a city of Samaria called Sychar, near the field which Jacob gave to his son Joseph. Jacob's well was there.\\" John's Gospel goes on to describe a conversation between Jesus and a Samaritan woman (called Photini in Orthodox tradition), which took place while Jesus was resting at the well after a tiring journey.Becchio and Schadé, 2006. Listed under the entry for \\"Jacob's fountain\\". () The site is counted as a Christian holy site. History The writings of pilgrims indicate that Jacob's Well has been situated within different churches built at the same site over time. By the 330s CE, the site had been identified as the place where Jesus held his conversation with the Samaritan woman, and was probably being used for Christian baptisms.Pringle and Leach, 1993, p. 258. By AD 384, a cruciform church was built over the site, and is mentioned in the 4th century writings of Saint Jerome. This church was most likely destroyed during the Samaritan revolts of 484 or 529. Subsequently, rebuilt by Justinian, this second Byzantine era church was still standing in the 720s, and possibly into the early 9th century. The Byzantine church was definitely in ruins by the time the Crusaders occupied Nablus in August 1099; early 12th-century accounts by pilgrims to the site speak of the well without mentioning a church. There are later 12th-century accounts of a newly built church at Jacob's Well. The first such definitive account comes from Theoderic, who writes: \\"The well ... is a half a mile distant from the city Nablus: it lies in front of the altar in the church built over it, in which nuns devote themselves to the service of God. This well is called the Fountain of Jacob.\\" This Crusader era church was constructed in 1175, likely due to the support of Queen Melisande, who was exiled to Nablus in 1152 where she lived until her death in 1161. This church appears to have been destroyed following Saladin's victory over the Crusaders in the Battle of Hittin in 1187. In March 1697, when Henry Maundrell visited Jacob's Well, the depth of the water in the well measured .Maundrell, p.105, p.106 Edward Robinson visited the site in the mid-19th century, describing the \\"remains of the ancient church,\\" lying just above the well to the southwest as a \\"shapeless mass of ruins, among which are seen fragments of gray, granite columns, still retaining their ancient polish.\\"Robinson and Smith, 1856, p. 132. Local Christians continued to venerate the site even when it was without a church. In 1860, the site was obtained by the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate and a new church, consecrated to St. Photini the Samaritan, was built in 1893 along with a small monastery.

The dome of St. Photini Church at Bir Ya'qub, as photographed from inside in 2008 Since the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, Jacob's Well has been a site of contention between Christians and Jews. In November 1979, at a time of increased tensions on the West Bank, the custodian of the well, Archimandrite Philoumenos, was found hatcheted to death inside the crypt housing the well. The assailant, a mentally ill resident of Tel Aviv, was apprehended three years later and confessed to that slaying and others, including an assault on a nun at the monastery and the axe murder of a Jewish psychiatrist in Tel Aviv. In 2009, the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem declared Philoumenos a saint thirty years after his death. Abuna (meaning \\"Father\\") Ioustinos, a well-respected Greek Orthodox priest in Nablus, later spearheaded a huge reconstruction project. Jacob's Well has since been restored and a new church modelled along the designs of the Crusader-era church houses the well inside it, in a crypt on a lower level. Physical description and location The well in 1934 Jacob's Well in 2013. Photo taken with permission on a rare day the eucharist was not being celebrated. Jacob's Well, 1912 Jacob's Well is located from Tell Balata in the eastern part of the city of Nablus within the grounds of the Bir Ya'qub monastery. The well is accessed by entering the church on the monastery grounds, and descending the stairs to a crypt where the well still stands, along with \\"a small winch, a bucket, ex-voto icons and lots of lit candles.\\" Joseph's Tomb, a related site, is located just north of Jacob's Well in an Ottoman era building marked by a white dome. According to Major Anderson, who visited the site in 1866, the well has > \\"a narrow opening, just wide enough to allow the body of a man to pass > through with arms uplifted, and this narrow neck, which is about 4 ft. long, > opens into the well itself, which is cylindrically shaped, and opens about 7 > ft. 6 in. in diameter.

It is one of the 100 Famous Japanese Mountains, and is also included on the lists of the 100 Kinki Mountains and the 50 Shiga Mountains. Mount Ibuki is the highest mountain in Shiga Prefecture. Outline Mount Ibuki is the highest peak in the Ibuki Mountains, which stretch from north to south along the border of Shiga Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture. Located at the southern end of the mountain chain with the Suzuka Mountains not too far to the south, a small plain at the foot of this mountain, Sekigahara, became one of the most important strategic points throughout Japanese history. Nature Mount Ibuki is well known for receiving the world's heaviest snowfall in recorded history. On February 14, 1927, the depth of snow at the top of the peak was according to government records, (in Japanese) which is a world record. Since ancient times, Mount Ibuki has also been known for its rich variety of wild plants and animals, as well as for its beautiful shape. Climate Mount Ibuki has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb) with mild summers and cold winters. Route There are two ways to ascend Mount Ibuki. The easiest way is to use the Ibuki Driveway. The summit is a 10-minute walk from the parking lot. There is also a bus going from Sekigahara Station up to the parking lot in the summer months. The alternative method is to simply climb the mountain from its base. Many climbers climb from the Ibuki-Tozanguchi bus stop, which is 10 minutes by bus from Omi-Nagaoka Station on the Tōkaidō Main Line. Until 2011 there was a gondola going to the ski resort Sangome about halfway on the mountain slope. Both have been shut down since then and all the lifts have been removed.

The show premiered on September 7, 1996 and ended after 26 episodes on June 21, 1997. It was produced by Hallmark Entertainment, Monkeyshine Productions.inc, and distributed by Bohbot Entertainment and aired as part of a syndicated animation block known as Amazin' Adventures, later known as BKN. Summary During the monkey-manned spaceflights of the 1960s, one rocket veered off course, sending a chimp named Charlie off into the outer reaches of space. After many years, Charlie’s craft was discovered by the most intelligent race in the universe, The \\" \\" (pronounced by not saying anything. Then followed with the explanation that their race is so advanced that their name cannot be pronounced or written; only thought. The running joke then had the other space monkeys asking, “The who?”) Charlie was given enhanced intelligence, weapons, and futuristic technology, along with a charge to protect the universe from the evil Lord Nebula. One of the more unusual villains in cartoon history, Nebula was a half-human, half-black hole who hoped to become a complete black hole, swallow the universe in a “Big Crunch,” then remake it in his own image. His one problem was that, being half human, he was still susceptible to human ailments, such as the common cold and stomach aches. To aid Charlie (who was given the title \\"Captain Charlie Simian\\"), The \\" \\" allowed him to recruit a team of fellow Earth monkeys: Shao Lin, a Chinese golden monkey with swift fighting skills and serene wisdom; Spydor, a wisecracking little spider monkey with a long prehensile tail; Dr. Splitz/Splitzy, an orangutan with a scientist/madman split- personality; and Gor, a big, strong gorilla who wrecked the intelligence- enhancing machine before he got a full helping. The group cruised the stars in their ship, the Primate Avenger, battling Nebula and his cyborg monkey henchman, Rhesus 2, and searching for the ever-elusive bananas. The monkeys mixed fast-talking humor with fast-paced action. CharactersHeroes= *Captain Charles \\"Chuck\\" Simian: Originally a chimpanzee named Charlie, sent into space in the 1960s by NASA. After drifting off course and being frozen for many years, he was discovered by The \\" \\". They believed he was sent by Earth as the most advanced species of the planet. When they realized he was not, they used a machine to evolve Charlie into a sentient being. After being told about Nebula, Captain Simian (as he now called himself) recruited a team of fellow Earth monkeys and apes to help him save the universe. *Gor-illa/Gor: An eastern gorilla originally from Uganda as a dominant male, and the crew's muscle. During the evolution process he accidentally wrecked the intelligence- enhancing machine before its completion. This left Gor rather naive and childlike, while at the same time possessing extraordinary strength. Gor is naturally quite peaceful and does not wish to do anyone harm, but when his friends are in danger he goes into a berserk rage. In an early episode Apax (below) kidnapped Gor to make him a prize fighter, but since Gor's peaceful nature did not permit him to fight needlessly, Apax experimented on him, turning him into a mindless, raging gigantic King Kong-like gorilla named Gormongous. Dr. Splitz was unable to reverse the effect of Apax's isotope, meaning that Gor turns into Gormongous whenever he gets angry, in a manner similar to that of the Incredible Hulk. *Orbitron: A small ball-shaped robot, given to Charlie by The \\" \\" to help him on his mission. Its role was to provide the monkeys with the additional knowledge they required for their journey. Already quite cynical and unpleasant, it was accidentally damaged by Gor and subsequently went quite insane, floating around sputtering nonsense that only occasionally makes sense. This leads Captain Simian to often say, \\"Gotta get that thing fixed.\\" Because it is so technologically advanced Dr. Splitz was unable to repair it despite trying. *Spydor: A wisecracking little spider monkey, originally the property of an organ grinder from New York City. A pickpocket, grifter, and all-around thief, he often tries to take advantage of Gor by trying to get him to do his work and trying numerous get-rich-quick schemes which get him into trouble with the Captain. Despite these flaws, Spydor is loyal to the mission, and will never betray his friends or the universe for money. He is especially close to Gor, and will not let anyone else take advantage of him. Spydor is in charge of communications. *Dr. Splitz/Splitzy: A former zoo Sumatran orangutan with a dual personality that alternates between an effete academic (\\"Dr. Splitz\\") and a rustic yokel (\\"Splitzy\\"). The doctor excels at scientific theory and somewhat cowardly, while Splitzy is a mechanic and engineer eager to jump into a fight. The two personalities are aware of each other and bicker constantly, but often rely on each other to make up for their individual shortcomings. *Shao Lin: A Chinese golden monkey, who originally lived at a Buddhist temple where she was worshiped as a goddess. She continues to act as a goddess with the rest of the crew even, on occasion, addressing herself in the Royal \\"we\\". This leads to considerable tension at first, though over time she warms to the others and vice versa. Skilled in martial arts and knowledgeable in Buddhist wisdom, she is Captain Simian's first officer. There are occasional hints of a romantic attraction between her and the Captain, though this was never developed. =Villains= *Lord Nebula (Voiced by Michael Dorn): Nebula is a half- humanoid, half-black hole who hoped to become a complete black hole, swallow the universe in a “Big Crunch,” then remake it in his own image. The gaseous nature of nebulae is employed as a running gag, as Nebula seems to constantly suffer from some cosmic analogue of gastro-intestinal distress. In the Series Finale he is trapped in an orb and Rhesus 2 takes over *Rhesus 2 (Voiced by Malcolm McDowell): An enforcer of Lord Nebula. Originally a rhesus monkey sent into space, Nebula made him intelligent and turned him partially into a robot. His brain is detachable and frequently changes from one to another in order to get different ideas. For example, Brain 1 might give him a more devious plan than Brain 2 or vice versa. *Apax (Voiced by Frank Welker): An alien with green skin and snakes in place of hair. Apax forces other alien creatures to fight in an arena. At one point, he injects an isotope into Gor-illa, causing him to turn into a monster whenever he gets angry. He often says \\"Only in Andromeda!\\". *Kaz-Par (Voiced by Maurice Lamarche): An owner of a club on Maltese 1, who simply planned to steal the Primate Avenger, but had to go under the identity of Gorr when someone else replaced him to steal the Orbitron and sell it to Nebula, as Orbitron keeps repeating \\"0-1-0-0-1-0-0-1-0-1... oh, and 0-1.\\", which was the formula for the GLOP (Gravi-Luminous Orbifolding Positrons), which had the component needed by Nebula, the Anti-Force. =Other= *Matrix: A computer that captures the Monkeys and learns from them to eventually evolve into a living being. Initially appears in episode Repo Ape. *Vog: Vog is a 2-dimensional alien. When Rhesus 2 steals gravitons from a cosmic storm, Vog's world rips open, so he follows Charlie to his universe and asks his help to put the gravitons back before the cosmic storm ends to seal the rip and save his universe. Appeared in episode Monkey in the Middle. *Holo Boons: Holographic baboons created by Dr. Splitz to test out the atmosphere of unknown planets. They are voiced by Jeff Bennett, with a number of celebrity impressions (such as Beavis and Butt- head, Jerry Lewis, Woody Allen and The Three Stooges). They are a parody of the redshirts from the original Star Trek series, and almost always get destroyed. *Grixilpix: Keeper of the Great Ear. This ear is the one of the Sleeping Giant, whom Grxilpix tells the monkeys is dreaming about the whole universe. Anything that someone asks for to the ear appears. Rhesus attacks Captain Simian and his crew next to the ear, and in their fight, they awake the giant, causing the universe to disappear. Dr. Splitz then plays a lullaby on a handheld device, causing the giant to return to his slumber and the universe to be restored. *Largo Trix: A swashbuckling space adventurer who meets the crew in a bar in the episode \\"Monkey Puzzle Man\\". Initially appearing as a blue-skinned humanoid, Largo gradually turns into a monkey-like creature as he hangs out with the crew, since he can duplicate another's most distinctive characteristic (martial arts skills from Shao-lin, who he flirts with, for example) after making physical contact. Everyone likes him except Simian (who insists there's something weird about Largo) and Gor (who resents Spydor spending more time with Largo then him), but are dismissed as jealous. Largo invites the crew back to his 'home', but it turns out to actually belong to Rhesus 2, whom Largo is working for. After making contact with Captain Simian, however, Largo realizes the error of his ways and helps the monkeys escape, apparently sacrificing himself to give them time to get away. However, it turns out at the end he managed to escape and leaves aboard a separate ship. *The \\" \\": An advanced alien race that is so advanced, the name of their species cannot be spoken or written, only thought. They intercepted Captain Simian while he was still a wild chimpanzee. Believed to be a human broken free of his evolutionary bonds, they gave Simian \\"The Gift\\", which is advanced intelligence and the power of speech. They assigned Simian to stop Nebula before he gets the anti-force and completes his dark goal which is to destroy the universe and create a new one within himself. During the series, The \\" \\" retreated to the 10th dimension until part one of the series finale, where they warn Simian that Nebula is getting very close to his goal.

Nikan is an ancient Persian- Zoroastrian name meaning \\"all the goodness in the world\\". Hundreds of members of the Iranian political or religious elite have sent their sons to this school, which is famous for its high quality education in math, physics, and natural sciences, as well as an emphasis on Shia religious values and teachings. The school is closely associated with Alavi High School. Nikan graduates have strong ties and form communities in different parts of the world, especially in Europe and North America. Each class has a designated number called \\"doreh\\" which shows the number of years from the foundation of the school after which the class entered the first grade (primary school).  Admissions  Nikan High school remains one of the most difficult schools to gain admission to. Usually, about 80% of the 8th grade class continues to 12th grade and admission past 8th grade is extremely rare. The admission process consists of an entrance exam and an interview with the candidate and his parents. In the summer of 2011, around 250 students took Nikan's entrance exam for admission into 9th grade, from whom less than about 10% were chosen. Those students were then interviewed, along with their families, and about 10 students were eventually granted offers of admission. Awards Several students from Nikan High School have been awarded medals at international math and science Olympiads such as IMO, IPHO, ICHO, and IBO. The school's robotics team has won multiple national and international awards, such as: * Won the top prize at the RoboCup, RoboCup 2005 Osaka - JapanRoboCup 2005 Osaka - Japan (NEE) * A preferment rank in IranOpen 2006, the Rescue Real Robots field (the RoboNikA team) * 2nd place in 1_1 RoboCup Junior, Soccer Challenge, IranOpen 2006 (the RoboNik1 team) * 4th place in 2_2 RoboCup Junior, Soccer Challenge, IranOpen 2006 (the RoboNik2 team) * 4th place in 2_2 RoboCup Junior, Soccer Challenge, IranOpen 2007 (the team was not known as a Nikan H.S. team but the individuals were Nikan students.) * 1st place in RoboCup Junior, Mind Challenge, IranOpen 2006 (the \\"OverLord\\" team)  Reputation The school provides a high quality of education, but its reputation is mainly due to its highly political and religious environment. Nikan is very stringent about certain rules for its students. For example, the school emphasized simple short haircuts for the good of the students. It can be argued that because of its exclusivity, some Nikan students find it difficult to later integrate in the wider society. That being said, there is a strong sense of comradeship among them even after graduation.  Education  The Iranian high school system offers three majors to all students: Math-Physics, Natural Sciences, and Humanities. Nikan mainly focuses on Math-Physics. That does not mean that other subjects are not taught at the school. As part of the Math-Physics curriculum, courses such as biology, religious studies, English, Arabic, economics, sociology, geography, and history are offered. The main concern for most high school students in Iran is the Konkour (national university entrance examination). Nikan hires well-experienced teachers, some of whom having scored the highest marks in the Konkour. Nikan also hires a few teachers each year who have taken part in the preparation of questions for previous years' examinations. Hence, the students are very well prepared. They generally perform very well in the Konkour.  Facilities  One of the largest and most luxurious high schools in the country, the campus is located in the famous Fereshteh neighborhood of Tehran. The school has three buildings: one, the main building, includes the classrooms, mosque, amphitheatre, library, physics and chemistry laboratories, computer room, and a fully equipped robotics workshop. The second building is an indoor multi-purpose gym (known as Chenaran Sport Complex) which offers volleyball, basketball, futsal and squash. The third building was completed in the summer of 2011 and includes multiple research labs, some extra classes and some offices for paper works. The campus has an outdoor track and field course, a soccer field, a badminton court, two volleyball courts, and a basketball court. There is also a flower bed and a pond in the yard which has become the house of two swans.

Geography Bagdad is located along the historic U.S. Route 66, east of Barstow and Ludlow, and west of Amboy and Needles. The town was founded in 1883 when the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway railway line between Barstow and Needles was built. At this time, Bagdad provided services to the Orange Blossom Mine several miles to the north, and to the War Eagle Mine several miles to the south. In addition, a dirt track extended south past the War Eagle Mine into the Dale Mining District in the Pinto Mountains. Bagdad was long a thriving town along the National Old Trails Road and the famous Route 66. It was bypassed by the opening of Interstate 40 to the north in 1973, and lost traveler's business and resident population. The remaining buildings were razed in 1991, leaving little trace of the town. Bagdad holds the record for the longest dry streak in United States history with 767 straight days without rain, from October 3, 1912 to November 8, 1914. It is to the south of the Granite Mountains and the Mojave National Preserve, and north of the Bullion Mountains. A small airfield known as the Bagdad Intermediate Field was built south of the town, immediately south of Route 66. It was operational in 1932, with abandonment between 1954-1958. A small, red concrete pad that was formerly the base of the airway beacon tower is all that remains. Bagdad Café The \\"Bagdad Café\\", located in Newberry Springs, California. The town is known as the fictionalized setting of a novel and a motion picture called Bagdad Café. The movie was shot at the Sidewinder Cafe in nearby Newberry Springs, which has since been renamed the \\"Bagdad Café.\\" In 1990, CBS ran a television series Bagdad Cafe, for one season.

Callahan (born April 11, 1937) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He served as a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1985 to 1995 representing the ridings of Brampton and Brampton South. From 1969 to 1985, and from 1997 to 2014 he served as a Brampton city councillor. Background Callahan has a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Toronto and a law degree from Osgoode Hall at York University. He operated a private legal practice in Toronto from 1965 to 1966, when he joined the firm of Beatty, Bowyer & Greenslade in Brampton. In 1969, he became a partner in the Brampton firm of Cook, Callahan & Leschied. Following the departure of partners Cooke and Leschied in 1982 and 1989, he continued in private practice. Callahan lives in Brampton with his wife Lyn. Together they raised four boys and have four grandchildren. Brampton City Council Callahan served as an alderman on the Brampton City Council from 1969 to 1985, representing Ward 3. Provincial politics He ran for the Ontario legislature in the 1977 provincial election, but finished third against Progressive Conservative Bill Davis, the sitting Premier, the riding of Brampton. He challenged Davis again in the 1981 election, and finished a distant second. Bill Davis retired from the legislature in early 1985, and Callahan was able to win the Brampton seat on his third effort. In the provincial election of 1985, the Progressive Conservatives under Frank Miller were reduced to a minority government as Liberal support increased in much of the province. Callahan defeated PC candidate Jeff Rice in Brampton by over 4,000 votes, and became a backbench supporter of David Peterson's Liberal government after Miller's ministry was defeated in the legislature. The Liberals won a landslide re-election victory in the 1987 provincial election, and Callahan defeated his nearest opponent by over 11,000 votes in the redistributed riding of Brampton South. He was not appointed to cabinet, and remained in the backbenches. The New Democratic Party won a majority government in the 1990 provincial election, and the Liberals were reduced to only 36 MPPs. Callahan was one of these, defeating NDP challenger John Scheer by 424 votes. In 1992, he was appointed as his party's critic for Correctional Services. In 1993, Callahan was a vocal opponent of the NDP government's plans to prohibit the picketing of abortion clinics within Ontario. In the 1995 provincial election, the Progressive Conservative Party under Mike Harris won a majority government based primarily on support from Greater Toronto Area communities such as Brampton. Callahan lost his own seat to PC candidate Tony Clement, later a provincial cabinet minister and a candidate for the leadership of the Conservative Party of Canada. Return to city council Callahan returned to municipal politics after his defeat, and was re-elected for Ward 3 on the Brampton City Council in 1997. He was re-elected up until 2010. He decided to retire from politics and did not put his name forward for the 2014 municipal election.

Tyler is a visual neuroscientist, creator of the autostereogram (\\"Magic Eye\\" pictures) and is the Head of the Smith-Kettlewell Brain Imaging Center. He also holds a Professorship at City University of London. Biography After earning his PhD from the University of Keele (1970), Tyler became a research fellow at Bell Labs (1974–75), where he worked with Bela Julesz, a vision scientist, psychologist and MacArthur Fellow. Julesz is well known for his invention of the random dot stereogram, which used a computer to create a stereo pair of random-dot images. When viewed under a stereoscope it caused the brain to see three-dimensional shapes. This proved that depth perception is a neurological process. After leaving Bell Labs, Tyler took a position at Smith-Kettlewell Institute of Visual Sciences. Tyler's scientific interests are in visual perception and visual neuroscience. His research has contributed to the study of form, symmetry, flicker, motion, color, and stereoscopic depth perception in adults and he has developed tests for the diagnosis of eye diseases in infants and of retinal and optic nerve diseases in adults. He has studied visual processing and photoreceptor dynamics in other species such as butterflies and fish. His recent scientific work concerns theoretical, psychophysical and functional MRI studies of the structure of global processes such as structure from motion, symmetry, figure/ground and stereoscopic depth perception and their susceptibility to damage in traumatic brain injury. Tyler's present and recent past associates include Lora Likova, Josh Solomon, Chien-Chung Chen, Spero Nicholas, Mark Schira, Lenny Kontsevich, Russ Hamer, Anthony Norcia, Lauren Barghout, Amy Ione. Autostereogram Shortly after arriving at Smith-Kettlewell (in 1979) Tyler significantly advanced Julesz's random dot stereogram research when he invented the first “random-dot autostereogram” (also known as single-image random-dot stereogram). The invention of the autostereogram made it possible for a person to see 3-dimensional shapes from a single 2-dimensional image without the aid of optical equipment. These images were later known as the “Magic Eye” after they were popularized by several N.E. Thing Enterprises publications that spent a number of weeks on the New York Times Bestsellers list. Art Investigations Tyler's art investigation articles fall under various topics, including composition, perspective studies, the eye-centering controversy, David Hockney's optical hypothesis, Leonardo self-portraiture, Manet's last painting A Bar at the Folies-Bergère, Masolino, space in 20th- century art, symmetry: art and neuroscience, the structure of consciousness, and computer art. Referring to Tyler’s statement in Ruth Leavitt’s Computer and Art, Rudolf Arnheim wrote in his 1987 book, New Essays on the Psychology of Art, that he was influenced here by a striking remark he found in an article by a California computer artist, Christopher William Tyler (5, p. 88). Arnheim notes that Tyler observed that \\"one of the trends of recent art has been the tendency to operate by selecting from an environment entities that have significance to the artist rather than creating from scratch on a tabula rasa … The instruments which are thought of as tools at the disposal of the artist become part of the environment in which the art is produced.” (p. 127) Tyler also has made convincing arguments against the thesis supported by Hockney's book Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters that optical projection techniques aided many artist's paintings beginning in the early 15th century, but spread over about two centuries between 1420 and 1595, citing variously Fabriano, Jan van Eyck, Pisanello, Mantegna, Melozzo di Forli, Cranach, Raphael and Moroni. Tyler indicates with geometric reconstructions at his web site Art Optics that the art works under discussion are brilliant paintings by eye rather than those compatible with optical projections. Octant projection Outline of the projection Da Vinci octant in the Codex Atlanticus The octant projectionOctant-projection (art of geography) Progonos-map-projectionsCsiss.org-map-projections or octants projection is a type of projection proposed for the first time, in 1508, by Leonardo da Vinci in his Codex Atlanticus. Leonardo's authorship was demonstrated by Christopher Tyler, who stated \\"For those projections dated later than 1508, his drawings should be effectively considered the original precursors ...\\". Tyler argued his case by separating Leonardo's projection authorship (1508) from Leonardo's map authorship (1514), unlike other authors who had treated the authorship of both map and projection together. Consciousness Studies His interests in the nature of consciousness have resulted in a reconceptualization of the essence of Quantum Physics, in which the Schrödingerian superposition of states is expressed as an inherent property of the conception of probability held by the conscious investigator rather than a property of the physical system per se [FoM paper]. While this retains the role of consciousness in the quantum framework, by casting the superposition solely as a property of the neural conceptualization, it resolves many of the paradoxes of Quantum Physics within the domain of classical physics.

Basella alba is an edible perennial vine in the family Basellaceae. It is found in tropical Asia and Africa where it is widely used as a leaf vegetable. It is native to the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia and New Guinea. It is reportedly naturalized in China, tropical Africa, Brazil, Belize, Colombia, the West Indies, Fiji and French Polynesia.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families, Basella alba Basella alba is known under various common names, including Malabar spinach, vine spinach, and Ceylon spinach. Description Basella alba is a fast-growing, soft-stemmed vine, reaching in length. Its thick, semi-succulent, heart-shaped leaves have a mild flavour and mucilaginous texture. It is rich in vitamins A and C, iron and calcium. It has been shown to contain certain phenolic phytochemicals, and it has antioxidant properties. It is also called Malabar Spinach. There are two varieties - green and red. The stem of the Basella alba is green with green leaves and the stem of the cultivar Basella alba 'Rubra' is reddish- purple; the leaves form green and as the plant reaches maturity, older leaves will develop a purple pigment starting at the base of the leaf and work towards the end. The stem when crushed usually emits a strong scent. Malabar spinach can be found at many Asian supermarkets, as well as farmers' markets. =Soil and climate requirements= Basella alba grows well under full sunlight in hot, humid climates and in areas lower than above sea level. The plant is native to tropical Asia. Growth is slow in low temperatures resulting in low yields. Flowering is induced during the short-day months of the year. It grows best in sandy loam soils rich in organic matter with pH ranging from 5.5 to 8.0. Uses 250px In the Philippines, the leaves of this vegetable are one of the main ingredients in an all vegetable dish called utan that is served over rice. It is usually cooked with sardines, onions, garlic, and parsley. In Mangalorean Tuluva cuisine, a coconut based gravy called gassi is paired with the Basella plant, making a delicacy called Basale gassi to be eaten with rice dumplings called pundi soaked overnight in the gravy, or with red rice. Some variations have tiny prawns, clams, horsegram or dried fish in the gravy as well. Beary Muslims of coastal Karnataka prepare Basalede kunhi pindi (small rice dumplings smeared in gravy prepared from Malabar spinach and dried tuna ). In Tamil it is called pasalakeerai. In Bengali cuisine it is widely used both in a vegetable dish, cooked with red pumpkin, and in non- vegetarian dishes, cooked with the bones of the Ilish fish and may also be cooked with shrimps. In Andhra Pradesh, a southern state in India, a curry of Basella and Yam is made popularly known as Kanda Bachali Koora [yam and Basella curry]. It's also used to make the snack item bachali koora bajji. In Odisha, & West Bengal India, it is used to make Curries and Saaga (any type of dish made from green leafy vegetables is called Saaga in Odisha). In the Western Ghats in Maharashtra, India, it is used to make bhaji. It is also known as daento or valchi bhaji in Konkani. A common Mangalorean dish is \\"Valchi bhaji and shrimp - curry\\". In Gujarat, fresh big and tender leaves are washed, dipped in besan mix and deep-fried to make crispy pakodas, popularly called \\"poi na bhajia\\". The vegetable is used in Chinese cuisine. It has many names including flowing water vegetable. It is often used in stir-frys and soups. In Vietnam, where it is called mồng tơi, it is cooked with shrimp, crab meat, luffa and jute to make soup. In Africa, the mucilaginous cooked shoots are most commonly used.Grubben, G.J.H. & Denton, O.A. (2004) Plant Resources of Tropical Africa 2. Vegetables.

Hugh, the son of Cathal Crovderg, pursued them; and a battle was fought between them, in which the sons of Roderic were defeated, and again driven eastwards across the Shannon, leaving some of their men and horses behind.

But the Galls of Ireland, when they saw they were to have protection, determined to make peace and settlement with William [de Lacy] and the Earls and to accept the award of the King of England as to the conditions of peace: so they disbanded and left their positions without having extracted terms or tribute from Aed O Neill for the nonce.\\" \\"Aed mac Cathail Chrobdeirg marched with a great force to the castle of Ard Abla in Tethba.

Hyperphosphorylation is one of the signaling mechanisms used by the cell to regulate mitosis. When these mechanisms fail, developmental problems or cancer are a likely outcome. The mechanism appears to be largely conserved throughout eukaryote species. The dynamics of mitosis are similar to a state machine. In a healthy cell, checkpoints between phases permit a new phase to begin only when the previous phase is complete and successful. At these checkpoints, gatekeeper molecules block or allow events, depending on their level of phosphorylation. Kinases are responsible for adding phosphate groups and phosphatases for removing them. Cyclins are molecules that manage the timing of cell cycle events. Cyclin dependent kinases pair up with cyclins to become operational. Cyclins are named because they are created or destroyed at predetermined points within the cell cycle. Kinase inhibitors add another level of modulation. Kinase inhibitors are grouped into classes and are assigned not very descriptive acronyms. These include INKS for inhibitors of kinase, KIPS for kinase inhibitors and CKIPS for cyclin dependent kinases inhibitors. Scientists have used a variety of tools to unravel the role of hyperphosphorylation. These include the study of knockout genes, the use of antibodies to block receptors on particular molecules, the use of temperature sensitive mutants, and microarrays to monitor the expression of particular genes. Yeast are a popular species for study because of the rapid cell cycle. Rb is one of the most studied checkpoint molecules. It is so named because defects in Rb are linked to retinoblastoma. In its unphosphorylated state it blocks the transition from G0 or resting state to S or synthesis. It does this in at least 3 ways. It inhibits RNA synthesis, it prevents chromosomes from unwinding and it binds E2F, a factor needed for DNA synthesis. When it is hyperphosphorylated, Rb becomes inactive, releasing bound E2F and allowing phase S to proceed. Wee is a protein that operates at the G2 to metaphase checkpoint. Wee becomes active if errors occur in the DNA synthesis phase. It blocks entry into metaphase until the problem is resolved. Like Rb, Wee becomes inactive when hyperphosphorylated. In contrast Mad1 is active when hyperphosphorylated. In its active state it is part of the checkpoint that blocks transition to anaphase. Cdc2, part of the metaphase entry checkpoint, is active depending on the pattern of phosphorylation.

Its headquarters are located in Durham, North Carolina, though its manufacturing facility is 30 miles to the west in Mebane, North Carolina. The company is a subsidiary of holding company Vector Group.  History  Liggett & Myers Cigarette pack (box) from the early 20th century John Edmund Liggett's grandfather, Christopher Foulks, was the owner of a snuff mill in New Egypt, New Jersey. During the War of 1812 the mill was razed by British soldiers. Foulks moved west around 1820 and opened a new snuff shop in Belleville, Illinois, in 1822. In 1833 he moved his tobacco business to St. Louis, Missouri, where in 1844–1847 (dates uncertain) John Edmund Liggett entered his grandfather's business. By 1858, Foulks's company was known as J. E. Liggett and Brother. Around 1869 the company created the first blended cigarettes, using a mixture of Turkish and Virginia tobaccos. A partnership was formed with George Smith Myers of Missouri, and in 1873 The Liggett & Myers Tobacco Company was incorporated. In 1876, Liggett & Myers introduced L&M; plug chewing tobacco, during the 1880s it entered the cigarette business and by 1885 the company had become the world's largest manufacturer of plug chewing tobacco. John E. Liggett died in 1897 and two years later Liggett & Myers was acquired by American Tobacco Company, controlled by James Buchanan Duke. George S. Myers died in 1910 and the following year the U.S. Court of Appeals issued a Dissolution Decree to the American Tobacco Company which created the opportunity for Liggett & Myers Tobacco Company to be reborn. It was headquartered in St Louis again. Liggett & Myers continued to release new brands. In 1912, Chesterfield was reintroduced as a Turkish-Virginia blended cigarette and in 1915 Burley and Maryland tobaccos were added to Chesterfield blend. It was in 1916 that Chesterfield became the first cigarette to add a moisture-proof, overall cover to the paper and foil pack. In 1917, the company built a warehouse and factory at Huntington, West Virginia. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. By 1921, cigarettes had become the most used form of tobacco. Continuing to innovate, in 1952, Liggett & Myers using Chesterfield became the first to offer cigarettes in two sizes: King and Regular. Liggett & Myers Factory In Durham, NC In 1953, L&M; filter cigarettes were introduced. In 1963, Lark charcoal filter cigarettes were introduced. In 1968 the company changed its name to Liggett & Myers, Incorporated. In 1970, the Eve brand was launched in regular and menthol. The company again changed its name in 1976 to Liggett Group, Inc., with Liggett & Myers Tobacco Company as a division. In 1980, Eve 120's were launched nationally and the same year Liggett was acquired by Grand Metropolitan PLC. In 1981 Liggett introduces generic cigarette concept. Another name change took place in 1983, this time the head company becoming GrandMet USA with the tobacco company officially named Liggett Group Inc. In 1983, smoker Rose Cipollone filed a lawsuit against the Liggett Group and two other tobacco companies that produced the cigarettes she smoked. Cipollone died of lung cancer in 1984, but the trial continued. The Liggett Group was charged $400,000 in damages in a 1988 court decision, but in 1992 the decision was reversed on appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court in the case Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc. Liggett & Myers factory sign in Durham, NC In 1986, Bennett S. LeBow purchased Liggett from Grand Metropolitan. In 1987, Liggett's stock was offered publicly on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1988, Liggett introduced Pyramid cigarettes. In 1990 Liggett became a subsidiary of Brooke Group Ltd., a holding company owned by Mr. LeBow. In 1990, The Wall Street Journal acclaimed Pyramid as \\"one of the most successful cigarette introductions of the decade\\". In 1992, Eve and Lark were relaunched with new packaging and backed by large advertising and promotional campaigns. In 1993, Liggett developed its Control Label concept, offering customers exclusivity to market Control Brands owned by Liggett. By 1994 Liggett had expanded its Control Label family to a total of eight brands. In 1995–1996, the company attempted unsuccessfully to take over the much larger R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. In 1996–1997, Liggett Group had become the first tobacco company to settle smoking-related litigation brought by the attorneys general of several states. In 1998 Liggett signed the tobacco litigation Master Settlement Agreement, and 1999 saw the formation of Vector Tobacco Inc. In 1999, Liggett Vector Brands Inc. sold L&M;, Lark and Chesterfield brands to Philip Morris Companies Inc., now known as the Altria Group.

The horseshoe is heated and a hole is punched through 90 percent of the steel with a forepunch or drift punch. The pointed end of the tool should be kept sharp and so that the burr is cut out smoothly. The punched hole is lined up over the pritchel hole and the pritchel is driven into the hole, knocking out the remaining metal at the bottom of the punched hole. The temperature of the pritchel should be always below the red-hot stage as the tool itself will bend and lose the temper. When over-heated it is advised to cool it in water intermediately. Back pritcheling The pritchel should normally be driven from the bottom of the shoe, similarly as the nail is driven. Back pritcheling is the process of driving it from the opposite side —the hoof side— leaving burrs and resulting in the weakening and cutting the nails. Pritchel hole A pritchel hole is a round hole in an anvil. Its primary purpose is to provide clearance for punching tools, but it can also be used to hold tools that have round shanks. Pritchel tools are tools such as punches whose functions do not require them to be held at a particular orientation. A square hole in an anvil is called a Hardy hole, not to be confused with tapered square holes seen in tinsmith's equipment.

The film stars Vin Diesel as mobster Giacomo \\"Jackie\\" DiNorscio, who faces a series of charges even though he has a prior 30-year sentence, but he decides to stand trial instead of informing against his family and associates. A wrench is thrown into the system when DiNorscio attempts to defend himself and act as his own lawyer at trial. The film also stars Peter Dinklage, Linus Roache, Alex Rocco, and Ron Silver. Much of the courtroom testimony was taken from the original court transcripts. Plot It's the late 1980s and low-level mobster Jackie DiNorscio (Vin Diesel) has just been shot by his junkie cousin Tony Compagna (Raúl Esparza), but refuses to press charges against him to police. Jackie soon gets arrested and is sentenced to thirty years on an unrelated drug bust. Tony, afraid of reprisals from the extended mob family run by Nick Calabrese (Alex Rocco), agrees to be a government witness for district attorney Sean Kierney (Linus Roache), who intends to bring down dozens of organized crime figures all at once. Kierney tries to bribe Jackie to be a government witness as well, but it's not in the gregarious Jackie's nature to be a rat. That sets in motion a massive court case where Jackie, Nick and dozens of other mobsters are tried together for a countless number of crimes in front of presiding Judge Sidney Finestein (Ron Silver). Upset with his current lawyer, who couldn't even keep him from doing a 30-year stretch, Jackie turns down an offer to be represented by lead defense attorney Ben Klandis (Peter Dinklage) and decides to represent himself in court, despite having no legal background or any real knowledge of how to proceed. Jackie's mischievous and vulgar manner amuses the jury on occasions but persistently irritates the judge, lawyers, witnesses, and defendants, including his friends from the mob. As weeks turn into months, the court case evolves into a marathon affair. Ben begins to believe that maybe Jackie could be effective, but Nick Calabrese is furious and Judge Finestein repeatedly threatens the charismatic mobster with contempt of court. Jackie's estranged wife, Bella (Annabella Sciorra), visits him in jail, where he is becoming increasingly frustrated. Guards spy on him and prosecuting attorneys remove his favorite chair, causing considerable pain to Jackie's injured back. He apologizes to the court and tries to mind his manners in the end. The prosecutors and the defense return to their offices expecting the jury to deliberate for at least a week. However, the jury comes to a decision after only 14 hours of deliberation. The jury reaches a verdict of not guilty for all. The entire courtroom reaches pandemonium as the family celebrates. The entire family hugs the twelve jury members as they leave. Meanwhile, Jackie is the only one bound for jail, returning there to finish his sentence. Jackie is welcomed as a hero in the correctional facility, where fellow prisoners chant \\"Jackie\\" and extend their hands in tribute to a man who refused to compromise his family for his life.

The critical consensus is: \\"Find Me Guiltys excessive length and heavy-handed narrative keep it from reaching its full potential, but Vin Diesel's performance is well worth watching.\\" Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars, calling Diesel \\"a good choice for this role, bringing it sincerity without nobility.\\" Ebert also praised the film's director, Lumet, who \\"was able to see the serious dramatic potential of Vin Diesel, dismissed as an action star, and use it for a remarkable performance.\\" =Box office= The film had very poor box office performance; on its first weekend, it grossed only $608,804 (439 theaters, averaging $1,386 per theater). It grossed $1,173,643 in the domestic market, and $1,457,700 overseas, for a total of $2,631,343. The film's budget was $13 million, and so it was considered a box office bomb. =Release= Find Me Guilty was released in theatres on March 17, 2006. The film was released on DVD on June 27, 2006. The film was released on Blu-ray in Spain on August 31, 2011 and in the United States on October 9, 2012. Actual events In August 1985, authorities in New Jersey indicted Anthony Accetturo, Martin and Michael Taccetta, and eighteen of the men who ran the New Jersey faction of the New York-based Lucchese crime family. It was the first time in New Jersey history that an entire organized crime family had been indicted in one prosecution. However, this crime family proved to be only a faction of the Lucchese crime family, only operating in New Jersey. But due to the crew's membership and 20 defendants, U.S. law enforcement recognized the crew as its own crime family. The case went to trial in November 1986, based on a 65-page indictment. It started in March 1987 at the federal courthouse in Hoboken. It ended on August 26, 1988. The U.S. Clerk’s Office in Hoboken confirmed that officially The United States v. Anthony Accetturo et al. was the longest criminal case on record in the federal courts of the nation. The jury found a verdict of not guilty in favor of all the defendants. The trial followed a ten-year investigation and generated 240 volumes and 850 exhibits of evidence. It cost taxpayers millions of dollars, and was the result of a 76 count Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) indictment.

Morgan Park is located south of the Beverly neighborhood and north of the Chicago city border, and includes Mount Greenwood Cemetery. The community, settled in the mid-19th century, was initially known as North Blue Island, being located close to the existing town of Blue Island to the south. , Morgan Park was majority-black, with approximately 22,924 residents in 2015. History 287pxthumbleftMap of Morgan Park, IL, as laid out by Thomas F. Nichols for the Blue Island Land and Building Company, 1870 Comparing this with a modern map will show how the far northern ends of West Crescent and East Crescent (today Oakley and Bell Avenues, respectively) were vacated between Remington and Monticello Avenues (today 107th and 108th Places, respectively) to create Crescent Park. The community was initially settled in the mid-19th century and known as North Blue Island because of its geographic relationship to the already established settlement of Blue Island to the south and because of its position on the Blue Island Ridge. Thomas Morgan became the area's largest landholder when he purchased all of the property between what is today 91st St. on the north, 119th St. on the south, Western Avenue on the west, and roughly Vincennes Ave. to the east. Morgan was born in Surrey, England, and came to the United States in 1843, briefly settling in Albany, New York. He was the son of a London banker and was left a large fortune by his father which he used to establish himself on the ridge in 1844. Here he cleared trees and operated a cattle and sheep ranch for the next quarter of a century. Morgan's son Henry was for a time the village president of Hyde Park before that community was annexed to the City of Chicago in 1889. In 1869, the Blue Island Land and Building Company purchased three thousand acres of this property from the Morgan family and laid out streets, planted thousands of trees, and built houses for those who were attracted to the bucolic atmosphere of the new community. The goal of the organization was to create a suburban community \\"..free from smoke and other nuisances that [were] becoming more and more intolerable in the city\\". Both the president and the treasurer of the Blue Island Land and Building Company were executives of the Rock Island Railroad at the time the former company was incorporated, and they immediately used their influence to have a spur line built to serve the new community. This arrangement lasted until 1889, when the \\"Suburban Line\\" as it exists today was built between Gresham and the Vermont Street station in Blue Island, at which time the dummy line, as it was called, was removed, much to the consternation of those who lived immediately nearby. At this point Morgan Park received three handsome passenger depots (at 107th St., 111th St., and 115th St.), with the 111th Street station being an elaborate Queen Ann structure designed by John T. Long that is sited immediately east of Bohn Park. Morgan Park (and especially the area of it depicted in western part of the map included with this article) is primarily an upper middle-class community, with a housing stock to reflect this demographic, although there are several estate-sized houses on the ridge at Longwood Drive. Many of the buildings in the neighborhood were designed by notable architects, including Dwight Perkins, Dankmar Adler, Murray Hetherington, John Hetherington, Palliser, Palliser & Co., Normand S. Patton and Harry H. Waterman. The community is home to the Beverly Arts Center. Because of its ecclesiastical associations (George Walker's father was affiliated with the old University of Chicago and Walker himself would play an influential role in the creation of the present University of Chicago, both of which were founded by organizations with Baptist connections) Morgan Park prohibited the sale of alcohol east of Western Avenue when it was incorporated as a village in 1882 - a ban which stands to this day. The suburb became a city neighborhood when it was annexed in 1914. Geography Morgan Park is located south of the Beverly neighborhood and shares a border at 107th St. with Beverly on the north, Halsted St. (north of 115th St.) and Ashland Ave. (south of 115th St.) on the east, 119th St. on the south, and (roughly) California Ave. on the west, and includes Mount Greenwood Cemetery. Beverly and Morgan Park share the same ZIP Code. = Horse Thief Hollow = In the early 1840s, a small section of what was to become southern Morgan Park had an unsavory reputation with the settlers in the region. What follows are the recollections of Isaac T. Greenacre, an early 19th-century resident who settled at the north end of the ridge. The area he describes below is today what is roughly the stretch of Vincennes Avenue from 115th Street to 121st Street: > \\"On the edge of the hill on which Morgan Park is situated, and a little > south, is a deep and exceedingly steep ravine. This in early times was > covered with long grass and thick underbrush, and was not only a very > discreet hiding place, but a very formidable fortress for horse thieves. > These notable gentry were rather nocturnal in their habits, as they traveled > during the night and by day were wont to refresh themselves in Horse Thief > Hollow. I imagine it must have been a solitary place as the long grass, > thick underbrush, and the forest overhead must have entirely excluded the > sunlight from it. The farmers are confident of the character of this den, > having found in it bags of oats and other commodities which proved the use > of the ravine for horse stealing. The bottom of the ravine was trampled into > a mire by horses' hoofs, and once in a while they would find a horse shoe. > The farmers have watched these gentry and proved to themselves the purpose > of their frequent visitations. The horse thieves generally traveled by the > aid of a buggy, in which they kept all the utensils necessary for their > business.\\" Rotary International Rotary International, the first world-wide community service organization, was formed in Morgan Park at 10856 S. Longwood Drive. It was the home of Rotary's founder Paul P. Harris. Today the house is owned and maintained by Rotary International as a memorial to Paul P. Harris and his wife, Jean. Demographics 54.8% of the residents were black and 37.2% of the residents were white. As of that year it was, within Chicago, the black- majority area with the highest percentage of whites.

St. Cajetan and St. Walter, both private Catholic schools, are located in Morgan Park. =History of education= There was a serious attempt made by the Blue Island Land and Building Company to have Morgan Park become a great center of learning, an effort which was successful to a degree in that it brought to the community Morgan Park Academy (founded in 1873 as Mt Vernon Military & Classical Academy), the Chicago Female College (established 1875), Baptist Union Theological Seminary (which relocated to Morgan Park from Chicago in 1877 and where the noted educator William Rainey Harper was granted a professorship at the age of twenty-three), and the American Institute of Hebrew. There was also an effort made in 1888 to bring the new University of Chicago to the community, although that project developed in another direction when its primary benefactor, John D. Rockefeller, indicated a preference for the significantly larger site at 57th Street and Ellis Avenue in Hyde Park that was donated by Marshall Field. It was thought by virtue of its size and its location in what was then the city proper that that property would allow for a much grander vision, and the \\"proposals (in Morgan Park) were at once laid aside in view of the greater plan\\". When the university opened in 1892, it absorbed the Chicago Female College and the Baptist Union Theological Seminary (the latter then becoming the university's divinity school), and for the next fifteen years Morgan Park Academy became a preparatory school for the university (at which time it was known as Morgan Park Academy of the University of Chicago) until the death of U of C president William Rainey Harper in 1906 ended the university's sponsorship and it passed into other hands. The school continues to operate today serving a highly diverse student body. It was recently ranked among the top private schools in Chicago. In 1988 the Walgreen family donated their home on the ridge at 116th & Longwood Drive to the Mercy Home for Girls.

Most unfortunate was the decision they came to there, to give the kingship to the younger and to expel the elder, Toirrdelbach son of Ruaidri, though he was irreproachable as regards valour, nobility and generosity. However, all the Connachtmen elected Aed son of Ruaidri in the presence of Galls and Gaels; and when they had reached the assembly he and the men of Connacht made for Carnfree, where he was installed, as was customary with every king who had ruled over Connacht before him.\\" For the year 1233: \\"Fedlim son of Cathal Crobderg marched into Connacht and Cormac son of Tomaltach [Mac Diarmata], king of Moylurg, came to meet him and brought him into Moylurg and they encamped at Druim Grecraige—[Fedlim], Cormac and his son Conchobar, the three Tuatha and Donnchad and Muirchertach sons of Muirchertach Mac Diarmata. They all determined to go after Aed mac Ruaidri king of Connacht and the rest of Ruaidri's descendants; and they inflicted on them such a routing and scattering that the kingship and sovranty of the province of Connacht was taken from the seed of Ruaidri on that day. Aed mac Ruaidri king of Connacht, Aed Muimnech mac Ruaidri and his son, Donnchad Mor son of Diarmait mac Ruaidri and many others not here recorded were slain there. For Aed Muimnech had violated the sanctuary of Tibohine and plundered it, and many other churches and sacred buildings had been plundered by them, so that they fell [by the hand of their enemies] to avenge the honour of the saints and churches of Connacht.\\" Category:1233 deaths Category:Kings of Connacht Category:13th- century Irish monarchs Aedh Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Gaels ","title":"Aedh mac Ruaidri Ó Conchobair"},{"id":"1617288","text":"Yakov Kasman (born February 24, 1967) is a Russian classical pianist, professor of piano, and artist-in-residence at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

She is the leading soprano at the Paris Opera House who is criticised by the narrator and the Phantom for the lack of emotion in her performances.litcharts.com/lit/the-phantom-of-the- opera/characters/carlotta In the novel, she is a minor character hailing from Spain. The first time that she is mentioned in the novel is during the chapter \\"The New Marguerite\\", where it is revealed that she could not perform at the ceremony for the former managers. Later in the novel, she is threatened by Erik that if she performs at the Opera House \\"a great misfortune will strike\\". She shrugs the warning off and performs anyway. When she does, however, croaking noises come out of her mouth and the chandelier comes crashing down. Ashamed, she hides from the public view for a few weeks, before making a return to the opera house. Carlotta is portrayed by Virginia Pearson in the original 1925 silent film with Lon Chaney. In 1929, new sound scenes were filmed and Mary Fabian was recast as Carlotta, due to the fact that she could sing. Virginia Pearson still appeared in new scenes, now playing Carlotta's mother. These changes are also the same in the 1929 silent, foreign cut of the film (which is most commonly viewed). In the 1943 film version, she is Mme. Biancarolli who has been drugged by the Phantom and murdered along with her maid when she tries to force him to take off his prop mask. In Andrew Lloyd Webber's 1986 musical production, Carlotta (last name Giudicelli) is from Italy and is one of the major singing parts. The opera company's prima donna, she despises Christine Daaé and sees the younger woman as a threat to her job and Phantom's courtesan, when Christine achieves prominence due to the Phantom's dirty tricks. Carlotta and tenor Ubaldo Piangi are lovers; she often turns to him for consolation when things go wrong, and she breaks down crying when his murdered body is discovered onstage. The film reveals that she likes poodles. In the Lloyd Webber-Joel Schumacher 2004 film version, she was played by Minnie Driver. Due to Driver's lack of experience in opera, her singing voice was dubbed by opera singer Margaret Preece, although she lent her actual voice to the song \\"Learn to Be Lonely\\" during the end credits. In Nicholas Meyer's 1993 novel The Canary Trainer, the characters of Carlotta and La Sorelli are combined into one, despite being mentioned as separate characters in the original novel. In Kim Newman's short story \\"Angels of Music\\" from the Tales of the Shadowmen anthology series, Carlotta is implied to be the ancestor of Bianca Castafiore from The Adventures of Tintin comic series.

Temperament Bull Terriers can be both independent and stubborn and for this reason are not considered suitable for an inexperienced dog owner. A Bull Terrier has an even temperament and is amenable to discipline. Although obstinate, the breed is described by the Bull Terrier Club as particularly good with people. Early socialization will ensure that the dog will get along with other dogs and animals. Their personality is described as courageous, full of spirit, with a fun-loving attitude, a children-loving dog and a perfect family member. Although the breed has been a target of breed-specific legislation, a 2008 study in Germany did not find that Bull Terriers had any significant temperament difference from Golden Retrievers in overall temperament researches.Ott, Stefanie A.; Schalke, Esther; von Gaertner, Amelie M.; Hackbarth, Hansjoachim (May - June 2008). \\"Is there a difference?

History James Hinks Bull terrier A Bull Terrier circa 1915 At the start of the 19th century the \\"bull and terrier\\" breeds were developed to satisfy the needs for vermin control and animal-based blood sports. The bull and terriers were based on the Old English Bulldog (now extinct) and Old English Terriers with possible other terriers. This new breed combined the speed and dexterity of lightly built terriers with the dour tenacity of the Bulldog, which was a poor performer in most combat situations, having been bred almost exclusively for fighting bulls and bears tied to a post. Many breeders began to breed bulldogs with terriers, arguing that such a mixture enhances the quality of fighting. Despite the fact that a cross between a bulldog and a terrier was of high value, very little or nothing was done to preserve the breed in its original form. Due to the lack of breed standards—breeding was for performance, not appearance—the \\"bull and terrier\\" eventually divided into the ancestors of \\"Bull Terriers\\" and \\"Staffordshire Bull Terriers\\", both smaller and easier to handle than the progenitor. In the mid-19th century James Hinks started breeding bull and terriers with \\"English White Terriers\\" (now extinct), looking for a cleaner appearance with better legs and nicer head. In 1862, Hinks entered a dam called \\"Puss\\" sired by his white Bulldog called \\"Madman\\" into the Bull Terrier Class at the dog show held at the Cremorne Gardens in Chelsea. Originally these dogs did not yet have the now-familiar \\"egg face\\", but kept the stop in the skull profile.American Kennel Club:Bull Terrier History , akc.org The dog was immediately popular and breeding continued, using Dalmatian, Spanish Pointer, and Whippet to increase elegance and agility; and Borzoi and Rough Collie to reduce the stop. Hinks wanted his dogs white, and bred specifically for this. The first modern Bull Terrier is now recognized as \\"Lord Gladiator\\", from 1917, being the first dog with no stop at all.ANKC: Extended Breed Standard of The Bull Terrier & Bull Terrier (Miniature) , ankc.org.au Due to medical problems associated with all-white breeding, Ted Lyon among others began introducing color, using Stafford shire Bull Terriers in the early 20th century. Colored Bull Terriers were recognized as a separate variety (at least by the AKC) in 1936. Brindle is the preferred color, but other colors are welcome.T.W. Hogarth published The Coloured and Colour Breeding, Galashiels: A Walker & Son in 1932, which included chapters – 'Colour Breeding in Bull Terriers' by Major T Grahame and Captain J.N. Ritchie and 'Colour Inheritance in Bull-terriers' by Dr F Fraser Darling. Along with conformation, specific behavior traits were sought.

History Its founding father was Flavius Theodosius (often referred to as Count Theodosius), a great general who had saved Britannia from the Great Conspiracy. His son, Flavius Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 379, and briefly reunited the Roman Empire 394–395 by defeating the usurper Eugenius. Theodosius I was succeeded by his sons Honorius in the West and Arcadius in the East. The House of Theodosius was related to the Valentinianic Dynasty by marriage, since Theodosius I had married Galla, a daughter of Valentinian I. Their daughter was Galla Placidia. The last emperor in the West belonging to the dynasty was Galla Placidia's son Valentinian III. The last emperor of the dynasty in the East was Theodosius II, the son of Arcadius. Later, both in the East and in the West, the dynasty briefly continued, but only through marriages: Marcian became emperor by marrying Pulcheria, the older sister of Theodosius II, after the death of the latter, Petronius Maximus was married to Licinia Eudoxia, the daughter of Theodosius II, and Olybrius was married to Placidia, the daughter of Valentinian III. Anthemius is also sometimes counted to the dynasty as he became a son-in-law of Marcian. Descendants of the dynasty continued to be part of the East Roman nobility at Constantinople until the end of the 6th century.

He was known as \\"The Duke of Duval,\\" like his father before him. Personal life Parr was a legislative page at the Texas capitol during one of his father's terms in the Texas Legislature and attended the West Texas Military Academy for four years. He was graduated from Corpus Christi High School in 1921, where he played end on the football team that won the South Texas championship. He attended a variety of post-secondary educational institutions, each briefly, and without completing a degree. He entered the University of Texas Law School in 1923 as a special student, but left without taking a degree. In 1926, he passed the bar examination and was admitted to practice. Also in 1926, his father Archer Parr appointed him to complete the term of his brother, Givens Parr, as county judge in Duval County. In 1923, he married his high school sweetheart, Thelma Duckworth of Corpus Christi. They divorced and remarried, and divorced again in 1949. He subsequently married Eva Perez. He had two daughters.Lynch p.25 For a time, Parr and his friends were enthusiastic and accomplished polo players, albeit on cow ponies with western saddles.  Parr family machine  The Parr Machine functioned on bribery, graft, and illegal donations. Political support came from the southernmost counties in Texas. The machine could produce large numbers of votes, both legal and illegal, from the impoverished and uneducated working- class Mexican-Americans. As a result, the county saw its largely marginalized but large numbers of native Texan yeoman farmers slowly disappear leaving the county commission to be controlled by the Parr family and its cronies. While the Parr Machine had always asserted undue influence over the county's affairs, it was not until Archer Parr that its leadership felt safely secure to overwhelm the remaining independent white farmers by appealing directly to county's new Mexican-American majority by offering them jobs (and in some cases cash directly from the county coffers) in exchange for political support. The alliance between the Parr-controlled commission and the Hispanic populace made the county a bastion of Democratic strength. By 1940, the white educated population had been reduced to a tiny minority amongst a large Mexican-American population. Parr garnered popular support with his charisma, his fluency in Spanish, and Robin Hood tendencies with sharing the Duval County and Benavides Independent School District coffers. After Archer's death, George inherited the Parr political machine, and the populace passed on the name, \\"El Patrón\\", to him as they did his father. When George attended the 1928 Democratic National Convention in Houston along with his father, people already understood him to be heir apparent, not merely his father's driver. There they plotted with Texas State senator Alvin J. Wirtz, Texas state representative Samuel Ealy Johnson, Jr., and the Bexar County machine to defeat four term Republican Congressman Harry M. Wurzbach in the upcoming election. (Johnson's college student son, Lyndon, also attended.) Wurzbach apparently lost the 1928 election, but was eventually seated in the House because of election fraud. The discovery of oil in Duval County also created ample opportunities for patronage, allowing Parr to amass a small fortune. To this day, the family's network has limited influence in Texas politics giving its patronage to both Democratic beneficiaries. James Albon Mattox, successfully relied on the old Parr network in his run as the Democratic Party nominee for Texas Attorney General, garnering a majority of the vote in the county despite running against a Mexican-American.  Parr political crimes  Parr engaged in the graft, bribery and fraud that are often associated with political machines. Along with other large landowners and managers of landed estates owned by prominent Eastern businessmen, Parr helped develop the practice of working illegal aliens and later using them for advancing political interests. More importantly, his own political career included serving as both the Duval County Judge and Sheriff. He also owned the San Diego State Bank, and the famous Dobie Ranch, including the Parr's Horcones Ranch. He was also a partner and silent partner of dozens of businesses in South Texas. He was convicted of tax evasion in 1932, and eventually served nine months in Federal Correctional Institution, El Reno after violating his parole. He applied for a presidential pardon in July 1943; U.S. Attorney General Francis Biddle blocked it in part because Congressman Richard Kleberg opposed the pardon. (In 1934 Archie's reelection to the Texas State senate was in doubt and he hoped that building a road to Corpus Christi across the King Ranch would save his political career. When their heretofore political ally Robert Kleberg, Jr. refused, George replied in anger. \\"You're crucifying my father... I'll get you. I'll gut you if it's the last thing I do.\\") Such a pardon would demonstrate Parr's power to the other political jefes in the Rio Grande valley. But after Tom Clark replaced Biddle, Johnson helped secure a pardon from U.S. President Harry S. Truman granted a pardon restoring his civil rights February 20, 1946.Lynch, pp. 39-40, 42-47, 51-52 He accomplished this through political maneuvering by ousting his congressional obstacle, U.S. Congressman Richard M. Kleberg of the famous King Ranch, with Major John E. Lyle, Jr. while Lyle was serving in the European Theater during World War II. By this time Parr had total control of the county, soon acquiring the nickname \\"Duke of Duval County.\\" 1948 U.S. Senate election In 1948 Coke R. Stevenson, Lyndon B. Johnson and others ran in Democratic primary election for U.S. Senate. Stevenson and Johnson advanced to a runoff election. For five days after the runoff, Stevenson appeared to hold a 112-vote lead. Then Jim Wells County amended its return, adding 202 additional votes, 200 of which were for Johnson. Johnson won the nomination by 87 votes, tantamount to election in an era when Republicans were not competitive in the South, and prompting the sobriquet \\"landslide Lyndon.\\" Most contemporary observers accept that Parr used his influence to affect the Jim Wells County vote totals in Johnson's favor. One probable motivation was that Parr felt obligated to Johnson, who had helped him obtain the 1946 presidential pardon. Another likely motivation to oppose Stevenson was that in 1944, Parr and Judge Raymond of Webb County had asked Stevenson, then the Governor, to appoint E. James Kazen (a Raymond relative) Laredo district attorney. The commander at Laredo Army Air Force Base argued to the Governor that half his men suffered from venereal disease and that a district attorney connected to the local political machine meant lax enforcement of laws against prostitution, which would adversely affect his force. For the sake of the war effort, Stevenson appointed a different candidate. Struggles and demise of political machine In 1950, Parr had become a thorn in the side of Governor Allan Shivers and Attorney General John Ben Shepperd. Federal officials began to investigate the machine. Some 650 indictments were brought forth against machine members, 300 of them at the state level. Parr, however, eluded indictment, and his conviction for fraud was later dismissed. Under the protection of Lyndon Johnson, Parr eluded all attempts to investigate and convict him for fraud, bribery, corruption, racketeering, and murder. Shepperd was a political advisor to Johnson even as he attempted to bring indictments against Parr. The Parr Machine was challenged by the Freedom Party in Alice, Texas, led by Jake Floyd. The Parrs lost control of that district court, an important office the Parr Machine was used to controlling all over South Texas. The botched assassination of Buddy Floyd, Jake's son, mistakenly shot and killed by Mario Sapet, on September 8, 1952, also signaled turbulent times for the Parr Machine. However, political candidates would from time to time make him an object of their reforming campaigns. In 1954 Governor Allen Shivers declared war on the Parr Faction and sent down a team of Texas Rangers and state investigators. He was charged with embezzlement but beat the case. The Parr Machine maintained control of Jim Wells and Duval counties despite the legal and political backlash. With the end of the Johnson administration in 1968, Parr lost his primary political protector. Under advice from Johnson and other prominent figures, he relinquished control of his machine to his nephew Archer III, by the early 1970s. The law finally caught up with Parr in 1974 when he was convicted of income tax evasion and given a ten-year prison term. He was found dead at his ranch on April 1, 1975, the apparent victim of suicide. When Parr's machine collapsed soon after his death, Duval County's small white large landowning minority attempted to retain control of the county politically but was unable to halt the take-over of the county Democratic party by the now overwhelmingly large Mexican-American population. Nonetheless, the family and its network remains influential so that although the county has remained one of the strongest and most consistently Democratic localities in Texas, frequently giving both national and local candidates margins greater than 70 percent. George's father Archie Parr founded the Dynasty of Duval County. Archer Parr III (1925-2000), né Archer Weller, Archie's grandson and adopted son, was the third Duke of the Duval County Dynasty. Archer Weller Parr was the county judge from 1959 to 1975; he died November 2, 2000 in Alice, Texas.

Parallel imports are often referred to as grey product and are implicated in issues of international trade, and intellectual property. Parallel importing is based on concept of exhaustion of intellectual property rights; according to this concept, when the product is first launched on the market in a particular jurisdiction, parallel importation is authorized to all residents in the state in question. Some countries allow it but others do not. Parallel importing of pharmaceuticals reduces price of pharmaceuticals by introducing competition; TRIPS agreement in Article 6 states that this practice cannot be challenged under the WTO dispute settlement system and so is effectively a matter of national discretion. The practice of parallel importing is often advocated in the case of software, music, printed texts and electronic products, and occurs for several reasons: # Different versions of a product are produced for sale in different markets. For example, the UK edition of Top Gear Magazine is officially sold in the UK, and Top Gear Australia is officially sold in Australia. However, some unofficial distributors in Australia also sell the UK edition of Top Gear Magazine. # Companies, either the manufacturer or the distributor, set different price points for their products in different markets. Parallel importers ordinarily purchase products in one country at a price (P1) which is cheaper than the price at which they are sold in a second country (P2), import the products into the second country, and benefitting from arbitrage, sell the products in that country at a price which is usually between P1 and P2. # Consumers who are able to obtain more competitively priced items and may be able to avoid local sales taxes, are placed on an even footing with consumers who have less access to overseas sales online. # Some advocacy groups support parallel importing on the grounds of enhancing the free flow of information. International approach Parallel importing is regulated differently in different jurisdictions; there is no consistency in laws dealing with parallel imports between countries. Neither the Berne Convention nor the Paris Convention explicitly prohibit parallel importation. =Australia= The Australian market is an example of a relatively small consumer market which does not benefit from the economies of scale and competition available in the larger global economies. Australia tends to have lower levels of competition in many industries and oligopolies are common in industries like banking, supermarkets, and mobile telecommunications. Private enterprise will use product segmentation strategies to legally maximise profit. This often includes varying service levels, pricing and product features to improve the so-called \\"fit\\" to the local marketplace. However, this segmentation may mean identical products at higher prices. This can be termed price discrimination. With the advent of the Internet, Australian consumers can readily compare prices globally and have been able to identify products exhibiting price discrimination, also known as the \\"Australia Tax\\". In 1991, the Australian Government resolved to remove parallel import restrictions from a range of products except cars. It followed this up with legislation making it legal to source music and software CDs from overseas and import them into Australia. An Australian Productivity Commission report recommended in July 2009 that legislation be extended to legalise the parallel importing of books, with three years' notice for publishers. The commission also recommended abolishing restrictions on parallel importing of cars. The Federal Court of Australia decision has ruled that parallel imported items with valid trademarks are subject to Section 123 of the Trade Mark Act. Various Australian Parliament committees have investigated allegations of price discrimination. =European Union/European Economic Area= The European Union (and European Economic Area) require the doctrine of international exhaustion to exist between member states but EU legislation for trademarks, design rights and copyright prohibits its application to goods put on the market outside the EU/EEA. =Germany= In Germany, the Bundesgerichtshof has held that the doctrine of international exhaustion governs parallel importation, subject to the EU rules above. =Hong Kong= In Hong Kong, parallel importation is permitted under both the Trade Mark and (amended) Copyright Ordinance before The Copyright (Amendment) Ordinance 2007 came into force 6 July. Seven arrested for copyright infringement =Japan= Japan's intellectual property rights law prohibits audiovisual articles marketed for export from being sold domestically, and such sale of \\"re-imported\\" CDs are illegal. =United States= In the United States, courts have established that parallel importation is legal. In the case of Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., the US Supreme Court held that the first-sale doctrine applies to copies of a copyrighted work lawfully made abroad, thus permitting importation and resale of many product categories. Moreover, the Science, State, Justice, and Commerce, and Related Agencies, Appropriations Act of 2006 prohibits future free trade agreements from categorically disallowing the parallel import of patented products.Shayerah Ilias, Ian Fergusson, \\"Intellectual Property Rights and International Trade\\", Congressional research Service, 17 February 2011 AutomobilesUnited States= The United States has unique automobile design legislation administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Certain car makers find the required modifications too expensive. In the past, this created demand for grey import vehicles, where certain models are modified for individual customers to meet these requirements at a higher cost than if it had been done by the original manufacturer. This procedure interferes with the marketing scheme of the manufacturer, who might plan to import a less powerful car and force consumers to accept it. The Imported Vehicle Safety Compliance Act of 1988 basically ended the gray market by requiring manufacturer certification of U.S.-bound cars. Parallel-imported foodstuffs, etc. Markets for parallel imports and locally made products sometimes exist alongside each other even though the parallel imports are markedly more expensive. This may be for various reasons, but is mostly observed in foodstuffs and toiletry. Due to the nature of hotels, travellers often have little information on where to shop except in the immediate vicinity. Grocery shops opened to serve brand-name hotels often feature parallel-imported foodstuffs and toiletry to cater to travellers so that they can easily recognise the product they have been using at home. Foodstuffs and toiletry made from different plants may vary in quality because different plants may use materials or reagents (such as water used for washing, food additives) from different sources, although they are usually subject to the same standards by internal QC or public health authorities. A person may be allergic to the foodstuff or toiletry made by some plants but not others. To sum up, the major reasons for such a market are: * Lack of information * Recognisability * Avoidance of risk due to products by different plants Issues A manifestation of the philosophical divide between those who support various intellectual property and those who are critical of it, is the divide over the legitimacy of parallel importation. Some believe that it benefits consumers by lowering prices and widening the selection and consumption of products available in the market, while others believe that it discourages intellectual property owners from investing in new and innovative products. Some also believe that parallel imports tend to facilitate copyright infringement. This tension essentially concerns the rights and duties of a protected monopoly. Intellectual property rights allow the holder to sell at a price that is higher than the price one would pay in a competitive market, but by doing so the holder relinquishes sales to those who would be prepared to buy at a price between the monopoly price and the competitive price. The presence of parallel imports in the marketplace prevents the holder from exploiting the monopoly further by market segmentation, i.e. by applying different prices to different consumers. Consumer organisations tend to support parallel importation as it offers consumers more choice and lower prices, provided that consumers retain equivalent legal protection to locally sourced products (e.g. in the form of warranties with international effect), and competition is not diminished. However, such organisations also warn consumers of certain risks in using parallel-imported products. Although the products may have been made to comply with the laws and customs of their place of origin, these products or their use may not comply with those in places where they are used, or some of their functions may be rendered unusable or meaningless (which may needlessly drive up prices). Electronic devices, however, suffer less from this type of risk because newer models support more than one user language. ExamplesAustralia= Importation of computer games and computer game hardware from Asia is a common practice for some wholesale and/or retail stockists. Many consumers now take advantage of on- line stores in Hong Kong and the United States to purchase computer games at or near half the cost of a retail purchase from the Australian RRP. Often the versions sold by the Asian retailers are manufactured in Australia to begin with. An example is Crysis, which was available from Hong Kong on-line stores for approximately $50 AUD but whose retail cost in Australia was close to $100. Crysis was sold in Asia using identical versions of the game box and disc, right down to including Australian censor ratings on the box. =Hong Kong= Importation of Colgate toothpaste from Thailand into Hong Kong. The goods are bought in markets where the price is lower, and sold in markets where the price of the same goods is, for a variety of reasons, higher. Electronic goods like Apple's iPad are frequently imported in Hong Kong before they're official and resold to South-East Asian early adopters for a premium. =New Zealand= The practice exists of luxury car dealers in New Zealand buying Mercedes-Benz vehicles in Malaysia at a low price, and importing the cars into New Zealand to sell at a price lower than the price offered by Mercedes Benz to New Zealand consumers. There are also many parallel import dealers of electronics hardware. Parallel importing is allowed in New Zealand and has resulted in a significant lowering of margins on many products. =Poland= There is an opinion, not scientifically proven, but very popular among people in Poland that \\"Western\\" washing powders are more effective in cleaning than Polish, because chemistry companies allegedly produce items of higher quality for Western Europe. Because of that, there are companies and online stores importing Western chemistry supplies to Poland (for example from Germany), even if similar brands are available there.http://www.luna24.pl/produkty/proszki-do-prania,2 =Russian Federation= According to Anatoliy Semyonov, trademark rights exhaustion turned national in 2002, and, as of April 2013, an act is being prepared that could make original goods imported without a permission of the producer officially \\"counterfeit\\" (by replacing things on which \\"a trademark is located illegally\\" with things \\"on which an illegally used trademark is located\\"). He notes that, according to the Criminal Code, illegal use of a trademark can be punished up to 6 years of imprisonment; and a similar article in the Offences Code makes goods with an illegal copy of a trademark subject to confiscation. =European Union= Some Sony PSP video game consoles were imported into the European Economic Area from Japan up to twelve months prior to the European launch. The unusual component of this example is that some importers were selling the console for a higher price than the intended EU price, taking advantage of the relative monopoly they enjoyed. After the release the console was commonly imported from the USA where it was retailed for much lower price. Other example are smart phones, which are being imported from China, where an average device can be bought for about $100 while a similar device would be retailed for about €200 in the EU.

Designed to give users more control of their personal information when browsing, P3P was developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and officially recommended on April 16, 2002. Development ceased shortly thereafter and there have been very few implementations of P3P. Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge were the only major browsers to support P3P. Microsoft has ended support from Windows 10 onwards. Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge on Windows 10 will no longer support P3P. The president of TRUSTe has stated that P3P has not been implemented widely due to the difficulty and lack of value. Purpose As the World Wide Web became a genuine medium in which to sell products and services, electronic commerce websites tried to collect more information about the people who purchased their merchandise. Some companies used controversial practices such as tracker cookies to ascertain the users' demographic information and buying habits, using this information to provide specifically targeted advertisements. Users who saw this as an invasion of privacy would sometimes turn off HTTP cookies or use proxy servers to keep their personal information secure. P3P is designed to give users a more precise control of the kind of information that they allow to release. According to the W3C, the main goal of P3P “is to increase user trust and confidence in the Web through technical empowerment.” P3P is a machine-readable language that helps to express a website’s data management practices. P3P manages information through privacy policies. When a website uses P3P, they set up a set of policies that allows them to state their intended uses of personal information that may be gathered from their site visitors. When a user decides to use P3P, they set their own set of policies and state what personal information they will allow to be seen by the sites that they visit. Then when a user visits a site, P3P will compare what personal information the user is willing to release, and what information the server wants to get – if the two do not match, P3P will inform the user and ask if he/she is willing to proceed to the site, and risk giving up more personal information.http://www.p3ptoolbox.org/guide/section2.shtml As an example, a user may store in the browser preferences that information about their browsing habits should not be collected. If the policy of a Website states that a cookie is used for this purpose, the browser automatically rejects the cookie. The main content of a privacy policy is the following: * which information the server stores: ** which kind of information is collected (identifying or not); ** which particular information is collected (IP address, email address, name, etc.); * use of the collected information: ** how this information is used (for regular navigation, tracking, personalization, telemarketing, etc.); ** who will receive this information (only the current company, third party, etc.); * permanence and visibility: ** how long information is stored; ** whether and how the user can access the stored information (read-only, optin, optout). The privacy policy can be retrieved as an XML file or can be included, in compact form, in the HTTP header. The location of the XML policy file that applies to a given document can be: # specified in the HTTP header of the document # specified in the HTML head of the document # if none of the above is specified, the well-known location \`/w3c/p3p.xml\` is used (for a similar location compare \`/favicon.ico\`) P3P allows to specify a \`max-age\` for caching. A dummy \`/w3c/p3p.xml\` file could use this feature: User agent support Yahoo!'s P3P policy as viewed in Internet Explorer 6. Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Edge were the only mainstream web browsers that supported P3P.Internet Explorer's and Edge's P3P Support Other browsers have not implemented it due to the perceived lack of value it provides. IE provides the ability to display P3P privacy policies, and compare the P3P policy with the browser's settings to decide whether or not to allow cookies from a particular site. However, the P3P functionality in Internet Explorer extends only to cookie blocking, and will not alert the user to an entire web site that violates active privacy preferences. Microsoft considers the feature deprecated in its browsers and totally removed P3P support on Windows 10. Mozilla supported some P3P features for a few years, but all P3P related source code was removed by 2007.Bug 225287 - Remove p3p from the default build The Privacy Finderwww.privacyfinder.org service was also created by Carnegie Mellon's Usable Privacy and Security Laboratory. It is a publicly available \\"P3P-enabled search engine.\\" A user can enter a search term along with their stated privacy preferences, and is then presented with a list of search results which are ordered based on whether the sites comply with their preferences. This works by crawling the web and maintaining a P3P cache for every site that ever appears in a search query. The cache is updated every 24 hours so that every policy is guaranteed to be relatively up to date. The service also allows users to quickly determine why a site does not comply with their preferences, as well as allowing them to view a dynamically generated natural language privacy policy based on the P3P data. This is advantageous over simply reading the original natural language privacy policy on a web site because many privacy policies are written in legalese and are extremely convoluted. Additionally, in this case the user does not have to visit the web site to read its privacy policy. Benefits P3P allows browsers to understand their privacy policies in a simplified and organized manner rather than searching throughout the entire website. By setting privacy settings on a certain level, the user enables P3P to automatically block any cookies that the user might not want on his computer. Additionally, the W3C explains that P3P will allow browsers to transfer user data to services, ultimately promoting an online sharing community. Additionally, the P3P Toolboxhttp://www.p3ptoolbox.com/guide/section1.shtml developed by the Internet Education Foundation recommends that anyone who is concerned about increasing their users’ trust and privacy should consider implementing P3P. The P3P toolbox site explains how companies have taken individuals data in order to promote new products or services. Furthermore, in recent years companies have taken individuals information and created profiles, which they then market without the individual's consent. Moreover, all this data is misused and we as consumers pay the price and become worrisome of issues such as: junk mail, identity theft and forms of discrimination; therefore implementing P3P's protocol is good and beneficial for internet browsers. Moreover, since there has been an increase of browsers there are more users at risk running into privacy problems. But the Internet Education Foundation points out that, “P3P has been developed to help steer the force of technology a step further toward automatic communication of data management practices and individual privacy preferences.” Criticisms The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) has been critical of P3P and believes P3P makes it too difficult for users to protect their privacy. In 2002 it assessed P3P and referred to the technology as a “Pretty Poor Policy”. According to EPIC, some P3P software is too complex and difficult for the average person to understand, and many Internet users are unfamiliar with how to use the default P3P software on their computers or how to install additional P3P software. Another concern is that websites are not obligated to use P3P, and neither are Internet users. Moreover, the EPIC website claims that P3Ps protocol would become burdensome for the browser and not as beneficial or efficient as it was intended to be. A key problem that occurs with the use of P3P is that there is a lack of enforcement. Thus, promises made to users of P3P can go unfulfilled. Though by using P3P a company/website makes a promise of privacy and of the use of gathered data to the site’s users, there are no real legal ramifications if the company decides to use the information for other functions. Currently, there are no actual laws that have been passed by the United States about data protection. Though, ideally, companies should be honest as to their use of customers' personal information, there is no binding reason that the company must actually adhere to the rules it says it will comply by. Though using P3P technically qualifies as a contract, the lack of federal regulation downplays the need for companies to abide.http://www.kcoyle.net/p3p.html The agreement to use P3P not only puts in place unenforceable promises, but it also prolongs the adoption of federal laws that would actually inhibit the access and ability to use private information. If the government were to step in and attempt to protect Internet users with federal laws on what information can be accessed, and specific regulations on how user information can be used, companies would not maintain the leeway they do now to use information as they please, despite what they may actually tell users. In 2002, then EPIC employee Chris Hoofnagle argued that P3P was displacing chances for government regulation of privacy.Tech Republic: Despite big-name support, new privacy standard slow to catch on, June 10, 2002 Critics of P3P also argue that non-compliant sites are excluded. According to a study done by CyLab Privacy Interest Group at Carnegie Mellon University 2006 Privacy Policy Trends Report only 15% of the top 5,000 websites incorporate P3P. Therefore, many sites that do not include the code but do practice high privacy standards will not be accessible to users who use P3P as their only online privacy guide. EPIC also talks about how the development and implementation of P3P can cause a monopoly of private information. Since it tends to be only major companies who implement P3P on their websites, only these major companies are tending to then gather this information seeing as only their privacy policies can compare to privacy preferences of users. The EPIC website says, \\"The incredible complexity of P3P, combined with the way that popular browsers are likely to implement the protocol would seem to preclude it as a privacy-protective technology,\\" EPIC continues on to state, \\"Rather, P3P may actually strengthen the monopoly position over personal information that U.S. data marketers now enjoy.\\" The failure for its immediate adoption can be related to the idea of it being a notice and choice approach that does not comply with the Fair Information Practices. According to the Chairman of the FTC,Fair Information Practices In The Electronic Marketplace, 2000 privacy laws are key in today’s society in order to protect the consumer from providing too much personal information for others’ benefit. Some believe that there should be a limit to the collection and use of the consumer’s personal data online. Currently, sites are not required under any United States laws to comply with the privacy policies they publish, therefore P3P causes some controversy with consumers who are concerned about the release of their personal information and are only able to rely on P3P’s protocol to protect their privacy. Michael Kaply from IBM is reported saying the following when the Mozilla Foundation was considering the removal of P3P support from their browser-line in 2004:https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=225287#c12 > Ah the memories. We (IBM) wrote the original P3P implementation and then > Netscape proceeded to write their own. So both our companies wasted immense > amounts of time that everyone thought was a crappy proposal to begin with. > Remove it. Live Leer, a PR manager for Opera Software, explained in 2001 the deliberate lack of P3P support in their browser:http://www.informationweek.com/story/IWK20010816S0004 > At the moment, we aren't sure whether P3P is the best solution. P3P is among > the specifications we are considering for support in the future. There have > been some issues with how well P3P will protect privacy, and for that reason > we have decided to wait until these are resolved. Alternatives P3P user agents are not the only option available for Internet users that want to ensure their privacy. Several of the main alternatives to P3P include using web browsers' privacy mode, anonymous e-mailers and anonymous proxy servers. The main alternative to P3P may not be these technologies, but instead stronger laws to regulate what kind of information from Internet users can be collected and retained by websites. For example, in Europe the Data Protection Directive provides individuals with a certain set of principles about how personal information is collected and the person's rights to protecting their personal data.http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/privacy/law/index_en.htm The act allows individuals to control the type of information that is being collected from them. Various principles are included within the act, such as the rule that individual has the right to retrieve the data collected about them at any time under certain conditions. Moreover, the individual's personal information cannot be kept longer than necessary, and personal information cannot be released to others unless the individual gives their consent. Currently, the United States has no federal law protecting the privacy of personal information shared online. However, there are some sectoral laws at the federal and state level that offer some protection for certain types of information collected about individuals. For example, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) of 1970 makes it legal for consumer reporting agencies to disclose personal information only under three specified circumstances: credit, employment or insurance evaluation; government grant or license; or a “legitimate business need” that involves the consumer. A list of other sectoral privacy laws in the United States can be viewed at the Consumer Privacy Guide's website. The future of P3P There are many groups who are working to further the future of P3P to make it easier for people to use. Some of these groups are: Transparent Accountable Datamining Initiative (TAMI) is a group out of MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. The goal of TAMI is to create technical, legal, and policy foundations for transparency and accountability in large-scale aggregation. TAMI hopes to help people manage privacy risks in a world where technology is constantly changing. Policy Aware Web (PAW) is a scalable mechanism for the exchange of rules and proofs for unlimited access control to the Web. “It creates a system of Policy Aware infrastructure using systematic Web rules language with a theorem prover”.W3C P3P site See also * Internet privacy * Identity management * Privacy policy * Do Not Track ReferencesExternal links *W3C P3P site **W3C P3P 1.0 Specification, published as a Recommendation in 2002 **W3C P3P 1.1 Specification, published as a Note in 2006 *P3P in Internet Explorer 6 (Archived version from March 2014) *Center for Democracy and Technology: P3P Privacy *Facebook's statement on P3P *Google's statement on P3P Category:Web technology Category:World Wide Web Consortium standards ","title":"P3P"},{"id":"1617457","text":"Selune may refer to: * Sélune, a French river * Selûne, a fictional deity in the Forgotten Realms See also * Selane ","title":"Selune"},{"id":"1617461","text":"Animation of eruption from Tvashtar Paterae, taken from imagery from the New Horizons probe in 2007 patera in the centre of the image, and the lava lake from the larger one above it.

Set in a gay-friendly small town in America, it describes a few weeks in the lives of a group of high school students. The story follows the standard romantic trope usually known as \\"boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl\\" except that the main characters are both boys, the narrator Paul and newcomer Noah. The novel won a Lambda Literary Award in 2003. Plot summary Openly gay high school sophomore Paul lives in a LGBT-friendly small town in New Jersey. He is best friends with Joni, whom he has known since early childhood and to whom he came out in second grade, and Tony, who is also gay and who lives in the (much less accepting) next town over with his strict, religious parents. On a night out with Joni and Tony, while listening to a friend play music in a bookstore, Paul meets Noah and is instantly attracted to him. They discover that they attend the same school and after some miscommunication and false starts, they eventually reconnect and start to date. At the same time, Joni (who has recently broken up with her long-term boyfriend Ted for the twelfth time) starts to date Chuck, a football player who was extremely cruel to Paul's friend, Infinite Darlene, when his crush on her turned out to be unrequited. This relationship causes a great deal of tension within Joni and Paul's friendship, and it also upsets Ted and Infinite Darlene. The previous year, Paul had dated Kyle, who then dumped him and spread the rumor that Paul had \\"tricked\\" him into being gay. As Paul's relationship with Noah starts to flourish, Kyle attempts to come back into Paul's life. He apologizes to Paul and starts coming to him for comfort and support, as he is uncertain about his sexuality and his aunt has recently died. While Paul is at first cautious, he comes to understand Kyle more and see him as a friend. Paul to Joni, who then tells Chuck. Chuck spreads all around the school and before long, people are placing bets on what they think the outcome will be. Noah's feelings towards Paul seem to cool at this stage. Tony is having trouble coping with his homophobic parents, and he decides to go for a hike with Paul in nearby woods. After their hike, Paul hugs Tony tightly, only to be interrupted by Tony's mother's best friend, who spreads what she saw to everyone she knows. Rumors spread that Paul and Tony are in a relationship, so Tony's parents forbid him from having contact with Paul. The next day, Kyle is feeling a great deal of stress and fear, and Paul kisses him. Noah hears the rumor about Paul and Tony, and in the process of denying that anything happened between the two of them, he inadvertently confesses the fact that he kissed Kyle that day. Upon learning of this, Noah ends their relationship. Not long afterwards, Paul and Joni's friendship seems to end. Paul is arranging the Dowager's Dance, a dance held yearly by his high school. The theme of the dance is to be Death, and in order to study this theme, the planning committee (including Kyle) go to a cemetery one evening. When Kyle and Paul find themselves alone together, Kyle kisses Paul and tells him that he loves him. Paul says that he doesn't feel the same way, and Kyle is upset and leaves. Paul goes to see Tony and explain everything to him, and Tony confesses that he is feeling troubled by everything that has been happening but that he is working on showing his parents that he is more than just his sexuality, and that being gay will not stop him from living a full and happy life. Tony's mother comes home and catches Paul and Tony talking, but instead of getting mad, Tony quietly challenges her and she finally allows Tony to see Paul again. Tony also decides that he wants to go to the upcoming dance, and he and Paul decide that his parents are most likely to let him attend if a large group of people come to pick him up. Paul realizes that he is still in love with Noah and that what he has to do is show him how he feels. Over seven days he sets himself seven tasks to prove his love to Noah and make his apology: * Day 1: Paul spends the entire night making origami flowers and decorates the hallway and Noah's locker with them. * Day 2: He writes a list of 100 words he likes and their definitions, and he leaves the list in Noah's locker. * Day 3: He leaves a note in Noah's mailbox wishing him a good day; he does not want to overwhelm him. * Day 4: He has his musical friend Zeke write a song for Noah, and Zeke goes with him to sing it. * Day 5: Paul buys twenty rolls of film (Noah's hobby is photography) and enlists his friends to give them to him in a series of creative ways. * Day 6: He writes Noah letters explaining everything he has been doing, thinking, and feeling. * Day 7: He closes the distance and speaks to Noah in person. Noah is overwhelmed by these gestures and asks Paul to be his partner for the upcoming dance. Their relationship starts afresh. Paul goes to see Joni and ask her to be a part of the group picking Tony up for the dance, but Joni refuses, saying that she and Chuck have already made plans. Paul challenges her, implying that she is letting Chuck control her, and he leaves. On the night of the dance, Paul gathers the group to go to Tony's house and ask his parents if he can come with them. At the last minute, Joni arrives with Chuck to join the group. Tony's mother hesitantly allows Tony to attend the dance. Instead of going straight to the dance, the group go to a clearing in the woods where Tony and Paul hiked. They start holding their own celebration there, dancing and talking and laughing. Tony and Kyle talk and dance together, and Paul and Noah dance together for song after song. Paul looks around him, wanting to fix this image in his mind forever, and the book finishes with him thinking to himself, \\"What a wonderful world\\". CharactersMain characters= * Paul: Paul is the narrator, a high school sophomore. Paul is openly gay and has known this since he was in kindergarten, and his friends and family are all accepting. He has a lot of friends and is generally well liked. He has lived in his town all his life, and he cannot imagine living anywhere else. * Noah: Noah is a newcomer in town, having lived in four different places over the past ten years, and Paul's love interest. He has close-set green eyes, untidy hair and a comma- shaped birthmark on his neck. While he is attracted to Paul, he is cautious about relationships after his first and only boyfriend (whose name is Pitt) cheated on him. He is interested in photography and painting. * Joni: Joni has been Paul's best friend since first grade. She has been dating Ted off and on since the fifth grade, but she starts going out with Chuck during the course of the novel. * Tony: Tony is Paul's other best friend, who lives in a nearby town. Tony and Paul met on a trip to the city two years before the start of the novel and became very close friends. Paul notes that they were not meant to fall in love with each other, but \\"a part of [himself] still fell in hope with him\\". Tony's parents are religious and homophobic, and while they love him, they are stiflingly protective and hope that they can find a way to change his sexuality. At the end of the novel, Tony has developed a budding relationship with Kyle, who, like him, struggles with accepting his sexual orientation. * Kyle: Kyle is Paul's ex-boyfriend, who is attracted to both males and females but does not like the word \\"bisexual\\". The book takes place a year after Kyle and Paul's relationship, which ended badly because Kyle told his and Paul's schoolmates that Paul tricked him into being gay. After apologizing to Paul over his past behavior, he begins to re-build their relationship. But Paul ends up rejecting him because he only likes him as a friend. Kyle eventually accepts this and starts to get to know Tony by the end of the novel. =Secondary characters= * Chuck: Chuck, a football player, is Joni's new boyfriend. He is not especially intelligent, and after his crush on Infinite Darlene turned out to be unrequited, he was somewhat abusive towards her. * Claudia: Claudia is Noah's protective younger sister, aged about thirteen. Claudia seems to often be moody and is mistrustful of Paul. * Jay: Jay is Paul's older brother, a senior. While Jay loves to taunt Paul, he can also be very supportive when the chips are down. * Infinite Darlene: Infinite Darlene, who used to be a boy named Daryl Heisenberg but who has blossomed since starting to cross-dress, is both the star quarterback and the homecoming queen. She has a larger than life personality and is intense in both friendship and enmity. * Ted: Ted is Joni's former on-and-off boyfriend (Paul states that they have broken up a total of twelve times). He's described as smart and good-looking, but somewhat self-absorbed, and a master of obliviousness. He is extremely annoyed at Chuck for dating Joni, but at the end of the novel seems to be developing a friendship with Trilby Pope, Infinite Darlene's arch-rival. References to other works Boy Meets Boy refers to David Leavitt's books The Lost Language of Cranes, Equal Affections and A Place I've Never Been; and, in the context of school work, to Oscar Wilde, the Brontë sisters and Of Mice and Men. Paul is involved with school drama and there is reference to a production of Mame. A copy of The Advocate magazine is mentioned as being found by Tony's mother in his room, thus revealing his secret. The Breakfast Club is referred to as a significant film in both Paul's and Noah's previous relationships. Other films mentioned are The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert and Boys Don't Cry, both with LGBT-related themes, and Say Anything..., a popular romantic movie. The Sound of Music was the previous year's school dance theme, and The Wizard of Oz is suggested for this year's. Gone with the Wind is alluded to when Paul describes Infinite Darlene as sounding like Scarlett O'Hara as played by Clark Gable. Songs mentioned include \\"I Will Survive\\" and \\"Bizarre Love Triangle\\", which Paul remembers being played at the elementary school assembly; \\"It's Always You\\" (the Chet Baker version) which is playing in Noah's attic during their first date; \\"Always\\" which Paul plays when he \\"goes Elsewhere\\"; and \\"If I Had a Hammer\\" which Tony sings to defuse a fight at the diner. The school band plays \\"All Along the Watchtower\\", \\"Typical Situation\\", \\"One Day More\\" from Les Misérables, \\"We Are the Champions\\" and \\"Personal Jesus\\". The pinball machine they prefer to use plays different Elvis songs depending on the score. References to real life The exclusion of people who are openly gay from the Boy Scouts of America is mentioned to highlight the gay-friendly nature of Paul's hometown, which decided in response to exclude the organization; instead they have \\"Joy Scouts\\". PFLAG is also mentioned. Reception Boy Meets Boy received many reviews that focused on the nature of the book compared to reality. David Levithan, the author of Boy Meets Boy, said, \\"I try to disprove the cliché as much as possible.\\" He said that writing books about teenagers in the gay community \\"[is] not the scary unknown anymore.\\" Being gay himself, Levithan tried his best to have \\"the chance to connect to his readers\\" by feeling \\"as if [his] readers are happy to explore wherever [he] want[ed] to go.\\" Boy Meets Boy focuses on the gay community through a teenager's eyes through a \\"delightfully reversed, pro-gay high school\\" setting. \\"[The book is] an upbeat story about acceptance and teen love long before the all-singing, all-dancing cast of Glee arrived on TV,\\" seeing as Boy Meets Boy was published in 2003.

The breed was developed in Australia, although the ancestral types and breeds were from Great Britain. It is closely related to the Australian Terrier and the Yorkshire Terrier. The breed is called the Silky Terrier in North America, but is called the Australian Silky Terrier in its country of origin and in the rest of the world.  Appearance  Australian Silky Terriers The Australian Silky Terrier is a small and compact short-legged terrier, at the withers, alert and active. The long silky grey and white or blue and tan coat is an identifying feature, hanging straight and parted along the back, and described as \\"flat, fine and glossy\\".New Zealand Kennel Club, Australian Silky Terrier All proportions and aspects of the body and head as well as desirable shades of grey and white and placement of markings are extensively described in the breed standard.Australian National Kennel Council, Australian Silky Terrier The Silky Terrier should be slightly longer than tall (about one fifth longer than the height at withers). This is a dog that was historically used for hunting and killing rodents and snakes, so its body should have enough substance to fit this role. The coat requires quite a lot of regular grooming and shampooing to retain its silkiness. The Silky Terrier has a strong, wedge- shaped head. The eyes are small and almond-shaped. According to the standards, light-colored eyes are considered a fault. The ears are small and carried erect. The Silky Terrier has a high-set tail and small, almost catlike, feet. The coat should be long, but not so long to approach floor length. The hair on the face and ears is normally cut.  History  A Silky Terrier puppy. The ancestors of the Australian Silky Terrier include the Yorkshire Terrier and the Australian Terrier (which descends from the rough coated type terriers brought from Great Britain to Australia in the early 19th century); few records indicate whether early dogs were just Australian Terriers born with silky fur, or whether there was an attempt to create a separate breed. According to the American Kennel Club, the breed was created at the end of the 19th century when Yorkshire Terriers were crossed with Australian Terriers.Silky Terrier, American Kennel Club At first the breed was known as the Sydney Silky, as it was found primarily in the city of Sydney, Australia. Although most other Australian breeds were working dogs, the Silky Terrier was bred primarily to be an urban pet and companion, although it is also known for killing snakes in Australia. Up until 1929 the Australian Terrier, the Australian Silky Terrier, and the Yorkshire Terrier were not clearly defined. Dogs of three different breeds might be born in the same litter, to be separated by appearance into the different types once they were grown. After 1932 in Australia, further crossbreeding was discouraged, and in 1955 the breed's name officially became the Australian Silky Terrier. The breed was recognised by the Australian National Kennel Council in 1958 in the Toy Group. During and after World War II American servicemen who had been stationed in Australia brought back to the United States a few Silky Terriers. Newspaper photographs of the breed in 1954 caused an upsurge of popularity and hundreds of Silkies were imported from Australia to the United States.History of the Silky Terrier, Australian Silky Terrier Club of Great Britain The American Kennel Club recognised the breed as the Silky Terrier in 1959, as did the United Kennel Club (US) in 1965 where it is shown as a Terrier; it is also recognised as the Silky Terrier by the Canadian Kennel Club. The breed is recognised by all the major kennel clubs in the English speaking world, and internationally by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale as breed number 236. It may also be recognised by various minor kennel clubs and internet breed registry businesses. =Breed Groups = The Australian Silky Terrier is a terrier, but is usually placed in the Toy Group rather than the Terrier Group due to its small size. As breed groupings are done mostly to organise groups of breeds for dog shows, it is safer for the little dogs to be with others their own size, rather than with larger dogs. The Fédération Cynologique Internationale has a special section of the Terrier Group that includes only the smallest dogs, while other kennel clubs place the breed in the Toy Group, but it is universally agreed that the breed's type is Terrier. An adult male Silky Terrier.  Temperament  The breed standard describe the ideal Australian Silky Terrier temperament as keenly alert and active.Fédération Cynologique International Australian Silky Terrier breed standard They love to be given chances to run and play, but must have a tightly fenced yard. They also enjoy brisk walks and playing ball. The Silky is able to do well in an apartment, although they are also an active indoor breed. It is important they are kept busy and social to discourage boredom. In a survey administered by Dogs 101, ninety-one small breed dogs (16 inches tall and under 22 lbs) were ranked by ability to learn quickly - the Silky Terrier placed in the top twenty. However, training one can be difficult, as this breed is often stubborn and deliberately willful. They are more independent than other toy breeds, yet are affectionate and loyal to their owners. They bark readily, especially when greeting strangers. Care The Silky Terrier's coat is highly susceptible to tangles and matting and requires daily brushing and combing. This breed requires a deep commitment from the owners. To keep the coat lustrous, regular shampooing is necessary. Use of an aloe and oatmeal shampoo helps alleviate the itchy, dry skin of this breed. This particular breed should be groomed regularly. Care should also be taken while grooming near the neck area, and a harness leash should be used to protect the Silky Terrier from tracheal collapse.

City of New York.  Legislative history  The bill was introduced by Senator Bob Dole on January 4, 1995, cosponsored by Senator John McCain and 29 other senators. Related House Bills included , , , and . The bill was signed into law by President Bill Clinton on April 9, 1996.  Judicial review  Raines v. Byrd = It was immediately challenged in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia by a group of six senators, first among whom was Senator Robert Byrd (D-WV), where it was declared unconstitutional by District Judge Harry Jackson, a Reagan appointee, on April 10, 1997. The case was subsequently remanded by the Supreme Court of the United States with instructions to dismiss on the grounds that the senators had not suffered sufficient, particularized injury to maintain suit under Article III of the United States Constitution (i.e., the senators lacked standing). The case, Raines v. Byrd, , was handed down on June 26, 1997, and did not include a judgment on the constitutional grounds of the law. = Clinton v. City of New York= Clinton subsequently used the veto on a provision of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and two provisions of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, each of which was challenged in a separate case: one by the City of New York, two hospital associations, one hospital, and two health care unions; the other by a farmers' cooperative from Idaho and an individual member of the cooperative. Senators Byrd, Moynihan, Levin, and Hatfield again opposed the law, this time through Amicus curiæ briefs. Judge Thomas Hogan of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia combined the cases and declared the law unconstitutional on February 12, 1998. This ruling was subsequently affirmed on June 25, 1998 by a 6–3 decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in the case Clinton v. City of New York. Justices Breyer, Scalia, and O'Connor dissented. The ruling has been criticized by some legal scholars.

Although their music generally follows the musical architecture and language of afrobeat, it incorporates elements of jazz, funk, dub, improvised music, and traditional drumming from Cuba and West Africa. History Founded in 1998 by Martín Perna as \\"Conjunto Antibalas\\", the group first performed on May 26, 1998, at St. Nicks Pub in Harlem at a poetry night organized by renowned visual artist Xaviera Simmons. Over the course of the next few months, the group solidified with a core of eleven band members and expanded their repertoire of original songs. For the first year of the group's existence, they performed exclusively at non-commercial venues such as block parties, lofts, and public parks, before securing a Friday night residency at the now-defunct NoMoore in August 1999. Called Africalia!, the residency lasted from August 1999 till April 2001, when the club was shut down by fire officials during the Giuliani administration's crackdown on nightclubs and cabarets. Guitarist and producer/engineer Gabriel Roth wrote several of the earlier tunes and oversaw recording and production of the first three records. Over the next few years, the band's presence grew; by summer 2000 Antibalas had released their first album Liberation Afrobeat Vol. 1 and had toured twice in England, while continuing to play at venues throughout New York City. Recording with the group in the early days was Cameroonian drummer Jojo Kuo, who can be heard on the studio recordings of \\"Uprising\\" and \\"Machete\\". By early 2002, the horn-driven outfit had released their second album, Talkatif, and continued to tour throughout the United States and Europe. In summer 2004, their third studio album, Who is This America?, was released on Ropeadope Records. Antibalas's album, Security, was produced by John McEntire and released on the ANTI- label in 2007. Antibalas has performed in 35 countries, from Japan to Turkey to Portugal to Australia, and throughout New York City, from Carnegie Hall to Central Park Summerstage to the Rikers Island prison facility. The group has received guest visits from several musicians from Fela Kuti's Afrika 70 and Egypt 80 bands, including Tony Allen (drums), Femi Kuti (alto sax), Seun Kuti (tenor sax), Tunde Williams (trumpet), Oghene Kologbo (guitar), Nicolas Addey (congas), Dele Sosimi (keyboards), Ola Jagun (drums/percussion), and Jojo Kuo (drums) among others. In the summer of 2008, Antibalas was featured off-Broadway in Fela!, a musical celebrating the life of Fela Kuti. The group arranged and performed the show's score of music originally performed by Kuti. In the fall of 2009, Fela! opened on Broadway at the Eugene O'Neill Theatre, once again with Antibalas. In 2010, the band released their Rat Race EP, with an arrangement of Bob Marley's \\"Rat Race\\" featuring Amayo on vocals, as well as \\"Se Chifló\\" featuring Chico Mann as vocalist. In 2011, the band reunited with producer and former Antibalas guitarist Gabriel Roth at Daptone Studios in Bushwick, Brooklyn, to record their fifth full-length album, entitled Antibalas. The album was released on August 7, 2012, on the Daptone label. The band resumed a heavy touring schedule beginning in April 2012 with their debut tour in Brazil, performing in São Paulo and Recife, and kicked off a US tour at the Outsidelands Festival in San Francisco, followed by a tour of California. On August 24, 2012, Antibalas made their national television debut, performing their single \\"Dirty Money\\" on NBC's Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. On September 11, they resumed their US/Canada tour with 30 dates in the Midwest, East Coast, Southeast and Gulf Coast, including the Austin City Limits Festival. On October 4, they appeared on NPR's Tiny Desk Concerts. The band toured in Europe in October and November 2012, followed by an Australian tour in March 2013 . In May of the same year Antibalas visited Mexico for first time, performing in Puebla \\"Festival 5 de Mayo\\" with originals members like Victor Axelrod. In 2015, The Antibalas horn section collaborated with The Dap-Kings horn section, Mark Ronson, and Bruno Mars to record Uptown Funk and other tracks off of Mark Ronson's 2015 album Uptown Special. They also performed Uptown Funk together on Saturday Night Live in November 2014. In 2020, Antibalas released their seventh full-length studio album, entitled Fu Chronicles, on the Daptone label. Amayo told NPR's Morning Edition \\"Since I was a kid, I was always studying martial arts and kung fu was very central [to] everything I did. So when I started playing music, I couldn't imagine not having kung fu as part of that training. But then, I wanted to now figure out a way to bring it all together. So this album was the first chapter in [which] kung fu meets Afrobeat.\\" The band will be on a worldwide tour in support of Fu Chronicles throughout 2020.

They are identical twins (but with different hairstyles and attire) and Marge Bouvier's older sisters; all three characters are voiced by Julie Kavner.The Simpsons \\"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\\" – December 17, 1989 Patty and Selma, both gravel-voiced chain-smokers, work at the Springfield Department of Motor Vehicles. They have a strong dislike for their brother-in-law, Homer Simpson, who likewise loathes them (but on rare occasion, he is seen as compassionate to Selma, such as holding her hand when she laments she couldn’t handle the kids on her own at Duff Gardens, and agreeing to be her husband to help her adopt a child. Selma herself has offered help in some fashion to help Marge and Homer, as she does envy their loving relationship). Selma, the elder by two minutes, longs for male companionship and has had several brief, doomed marriages. Patty is a lesbian.

Patty and Selma debuted on the first Simpsons episode \\"Simpsons Roasting On An Open Fire\\", which aired on December 17, 1989.

Notable differences include: *Hairstyle: Patty has an afro, while Selma's similarly textured hair is parted in the middle to form an \\"M\\".

Their hair has turned blue-gray from long-term exposure to cigarette smoke and ash. Biography  Rarely seen apart, Patty and Selma are known for their distinctive gravelly voices, cynical outlook on life, bitter and unpleasant personalities, and love of cigarettes. They share an apartment at the Spinster City apartment complex and both work at the DMV. The two are avid, sometimes maniacal fans of the TV series, MacGyver. The two seem to be aroused by the character and smoke a cigarette after every viewing of the show. When Jay Sherman, on advice from Homer, told Patty and Selma that MacGyver is gay, they stripped him to his boxers and hung him from the gutters.The Simpsons – \\"A Star is Burns\\" On the eve of Selma's marriage to Sideshow Bob, he insulted MacGyver and the wedding was almost cancelled as a result.The Simpsons. \\"Black Widower\\" Selma and Patty once met the actor who portrayed MacGyver, Richard Dean Anderson, and kidnapped him.The Simpsons – \\"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bangalore\\" Patty and Selma have taken many vacations together to various places including Czechoslovakia and the Dead Sea, where Selma sunk to the bottom when she attempted to float on her back.The Simpsons. \\"Flaming Moe's\\" Patty and Selma have also brought home \\"souvenirs\\" from their vacations, including a pillowcase full of seashells from their trip to Sulfur Bay that they forced the family to help them clean and organize.The Simpsons. \\"Treehouse of Horror VI\\" They drove away Richard Dean Anderson by showing him slides of their trip to the Remington Carriage Museum in Cardston, Alberta.

We are richer for having lost him\\" and use it as a coffee table,The Simpsons – \\"Mother Simpson\\" stick pins in a voodoo doll which looks like HomerThe Simpsons – \\"Homer and Apu\\" and even commissioned a billboard urging voters to evict Homer from Springfield.The Simpsons – \\"Three Gays of the Condo\\" When Homer contemplated suicide, they encouraged him to go through with it and then pushed him off the bridge, though this was actually part of a plot by the townspeople to bring Homer to his surprise party on a cruise ship.The Simpsons – \\"Eternal Moonshine of the Simpson Mind\\" Patty has also given stoner Otto Mann a driver's license due to their mutual dislike for Homer,The Simpsons. \\"The Otto Show\\" and both she and Selma deliberately failed Homer on his limousine driver's test, but their victory smoking nearly cost them their jobs until Homer intervened.The Simpsons. \\"Homer vs. Patty and Selma\\" They once kidnapped Homer before his and Marge's second wedding and imprisoned him in a cellar in the hope that Marge would find someone else. Moved to tears by his obvious devotion to Marge, they let him go and paid for their wedding ceremony in order to avoid being exposed by Bart and Lisa.The Simpsons – \\"Wedding for Disaster\\" For his part, Homer regards them as the \\"Gruesome Twosome\\"The Simpsons – \\"Krusty Gets Busted\\" or \\"Fatty and Smellma\\"The Simpsons. \\"The Fat and the Furriest and was delighted when he (mistakenly) heard they had died.The Simpsons – \\"American History X-cellent\\" As children, Patty and Selma were apparently domineering towards Marge and ridiculed her ambition of becoming an astronaut. In return for their allowance, Marge used to do chores for them. The free time they now had led to them taking up smoking.The Simpsons – \\"Three Men and a Comic Book\\" As adults, the Bouvier twins have a friendly relationship with their sister and seem very protective of her and thus frequently visit the Simpsons. They seem relatively fond of their nieces and nephew, but seem to like them more when they are young, as one of them remarks \\"The older they get, the cuter they ain't.\\"The Simpsons – \\"Lisa's First Word\\" On occasions, they babysit Bart, Lisa and Maggie, something not relished by the kids. Bart and Lisa were left traumatized when they had to stay with their aunts for a week while a stressed out Marge left for Rancho Relaxo. Maggie managed to take evasive action and got to stay with Homer instead.The Simpsons – \\"Homer Alone\\" =Patty Bouvier= Patricia Maleficent Bouvier is the younger of the two. Despite the similarities between her and Selma, Patty is more jaded than her sister, particularly towards relationships. It was once said by Marge that Patty chose a life of celibacy, and that Selma had it thrust upon her.The Simpsons. \\"Principal Charming\\" Her decision to not have relationships has been implied to be due to her then closeted sexuality. Generally, Patty is more hostile to Homer than Selma is. However, when Patty came out as a lesbian, she found a surprising supporter in Homer (in contrast to Marge who was at first surprised and angry about it), and she swallowed her pride and asked him to perform her marriage ceremony. They also teamed up to try to scupper the burgeoning relationship between Selma and Homer's father Abe. Patty also joined Homer's group to ghost-write an original fantasy fiction novel, and also to stop their novel from being replaced with a drastically revamped version by the book publishing company.The Simpsons – \\"The Book Job\\" In one episode, where Patty stayed at the Simpson house during a fight with Selma despite Homer's reluctance, Patty privately admitted to Homer that she only mocks him because she is jealous of him having a successful marriage and family with Marge, while all she has is Selma, leaving Homer feeling grateful for her having opened, albeit briefly, a window of kindness.The Simpsons – \\"Puffless\\" Relationships Patty's only known relationship with a man was Principal Skinner. On a blind date arranged by Homer, Skinner was supposed to fall for Selma, but he noticed Patty first and fell in love with her instead. They dated for a while but she turned down his marriage proposal, telling him she was too devoted to Selma to abandon her. However, she did consider Skinner a gentleman and ended their relationship with the words \\"Good night, sweet principal.\\" Like Selma, Patty also has a long-running fixation on MacGyver, although this aspect of her personality has been played down in later episodes. After coming out as a lesbian, Patty exclaims \\"you could see it from space!\\". There had been many previous hints of her sexuality: she was seen visiting a burlesque house;The Simpsons – \\"Bart After Dark\\" she exclaimed (upon seeing Homer naked) \\"There goes the last lingering thread of my heterosexuality\\";The Simpsons – \\"Treehouse of Horror III\\" she was seen hiding in a closet with Smithers on a parade float during a gay pride parade.The Simpsons – \\"Jaws Wired Shut\\" In another nod to Patty's sexuality being obvious, Homer sarcastically quipped, \\"Here's another bomb for ya, Marge: I like beer!\\" when Marge was shocked at the revelation. Patty wooed a tenured professor from Yale University away from her husbandThe Simpsons. \\"Homer Simpson, This is Your Wife\\" and has also been attracted to Edna Krabappel. Selma says \\"I can't face prison\\" and Patty replies \\"I can.\\" Patty's only serious relationship with a woman however was with Veronica, a pro golfer. It was later discovered by Marge and revealed during Patty's wedding that Veronica was actually a man in disguise. =Selma Bouvier= Selma Bouvier is two minutes older than Patty. Due to a childhood bottle rocket accident, she has no sense of taste or smell.The Simpsons- \\"Black Widower\\" According to Marge, Selma \\"likes Police Academy movies and Hummel figurines, and walking through the park on clear autumn days.\\" In contrast to her twin, Selma yearns for male companionship and children. She is also slightly more sympathetic towards Homer than Patty. Selma helped reunite Homer and Marge after seeing how upset Marge was without him, despite an agreement with Patty not to say anything.The Simpsons – \\"I Married Marge\\" Homer was sympathetic to her when she broke down after a disastrous trip to Duff Gardens with Bart and Lisa, remarking \\"I just couldn't cut it today\\", referring to raising kids. Homer also agreed to pose as Selma's husband to help her adopt a baby from China.The Simpsons – \\"Goo Goo Gai Pan\\" During Homer and Marge's trial separation, when Marge went out on a date with someone else, Selma called Homer and offered to help him save their marriage, but was left frustrated when Homer mistook her for Patty over the phone.The Simpsons – \\"Every Man's Dream\\" Unable to find companionship in a man, Selma has also sought to have children. At one point she considered using a sperm donor which Homer mistakenly thought meant Selma would have sex with a robot. After babysitting Bart and Lisa for a day, she realized she was not ready to have children and wound up adopting Jub-Jub, her late Aunt Gladys's pet iguana.The Simpsons. \\"Selma's Choice\\"According to a The Simpsons DVD commentary and by episode writer O'Brien on Late Night with Conan O'Brien Much later, she adopted a Chinese baby girl, Ling. During the adoption process, Selma pretended to be married to Homer, since the Chinese government only allows children to be adopted by married couples.\\"In the Family Way\\" , The Next Big Thing, October 10, 2003. Julia Sweeney tells about the messages she received from Chinese adoption agencies trying to confirm her heterosexuality due to government opposition to gay adoption After the fraud was exposed, Selma managed to keep the baby as a Chinese dignitary (voiced by Lucy Liu), who had also been raised by a single parent, became sympathetic. Relationships Despite being identical twins, Patty and Selma have very different track records when it comes to finding dates. According to Marge, Patty chose a life of celibacy, while Selma had celibacy thrust upon her. Her standards are extremely low, as evidenced by her comments on Mr. Burns: \\"Single, eh? Well, he passes the Selma Test.\\" Selma has actively sought out a husband, and has been married to six different men. Her current name has evolved into Selma Bouvier-Terwilliger-Hutz-McClure-Stu-Simpson-D'Amico. Her first marriage, to Robert \\"Sideshow Bob\\" Terwilliger, ended when his plan to kill her was foiled by Bart. After an off-screen marriage to Lionel Hutz,The Simpsons \\"Much Apu About Nothing\\" she began dating Troy McClure. They married, but she soon discovered it was just a sham to boost his flagging career. She told him she was unwilling to bring a baby into a loveless marriage and broke it off.The Simpsons. \\"A Fish Called Selma\\" Another unseen marriage was to Disco Stu,The Simpsons. \\"There's Something About Marrying\\" which was annulled by the Pope. For a time she dated Abe Simpson, to the horror of Homer and Patty. Despite their objections, the two got married, but came to realize it would not work due to his age and her job, so they called it quits.The Simpsons\\"Rome-old and Juli-eh\\" Her most recent husband is Fat Tony, though he was already married and regarded Selma as his \\"goomar\\".The Simpsons. \\"The Real Housewives of Fat Tony\\" It has been implied that Selma had a second failed marriage to Sideshow Bob, giving her a total of seven marriages. One person Selma refused to marry was Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, because she said her collection of last names was long enough. However, there is evidence that she slept with Apu after Homer and Marge's second wedding. Selma has also dated various other men around Springfield, among them Hans Moleman, Moe Szyslak,The Simpsons. \\"'Scuse Me While I Miss The Sky\\" and pitifully, Barney Gumble. She was rejected by Groundskeeper Willie, who upon seeing her dating video remarked \\"Back to the Loch with you Nessie\\". CharacterCreation= Series creator Matt Groening said he suggested that Kavner voice Patty and Selma as characters who \\"suck the life out of everything....\\" Al Jean said Kavner makes Patty's voice more masculine and a lower register, while Selma's voice is a little sweeter. =Development= In the 2005 episode \\"There's Something About Marrying\\" of the sixteenth season, Patty was revealed to be a lesbian and became the first openly gay recurring character in the series. Groening has stated that the staff wanted to out Patty as gay because portraying her as a \\"love-starved spinster [...] seemed old\\" on the show. There had previously been hints about Patty's orientation. For example, in the season thirteen episode \\"Jaws Wired Shut\\" she is part of the Springfield Gay Pride Parade's \\"stayin' in the closet\\" float, though only her voice was heard and she was not seen. According to the publications Zeek: A Jewish Journal of Thought and Culture and Value War: Public Opinion and the Politics of Gay Rights, it was the controversial lesbian outing of the main character (played by Ellen DeGeneres) in the sitcom Ellen in 1997 that paved the way for Patty's coming-out in \\"There's Something About Marrying\\", as well as for many other gay characters on other television shows. In his book Queers in American Popular Culture, Jim Elledge noted that it is possible the Simpsons staff chose Patty to come out as gay instead of a male character because lesbians were \\"traditionally considered more acceptable\\" on television. She did, however, not \\"adhere to the eroticized male lesbian fantasy or fit into the loveable, asexual guise of the comedy lesbian\\" that had previously been seen on shows such as Ellen. Instead, Patty is \\"rude, crude, and not ashamed of declaring her sexual preferences\\", and this could make her unpalatable to some viewers according to Elledge. It was reported a long time in advance of the episode's airing in 2005 that a major character would come out as gay during the episode. There was a widespread debate among fans of the series as to who the character would be. Patty was suspected by many fans and the press because she had not often been seen dating men on the show. The tabloid newspaper The Sun revealed already in September 2004 that character who would come out was Patty, though this was regarded as a rumor and The Simpsons executive producer Al Jean would not confirm it. Bookmakers in the United States and the United Kingdom took bets on which character would be uncovered as homosexual—BetUS laid odds at four to five that it was Patty, while Smithers had four to one odds and Ned Flanders fifteen to one odds. BetUS said gamblers made more than 900 bets on the coming-out on their website. According to The Baltimore Sun, another bookmaker Paddy Power \\"stopped taking wagers because so much money was being placed on [Patty].\\" ReferencesExternal links * The Simpsons Archive: The Patty and Selma File Category:The Simpsons characters Category:Television characters introduced in 1989 Category:Animated duos Category:Television duos Category:Fictional civil servants Category:Fictional identical twins Category:Fictional smokers Category:Animated human characters Category:Female characters in animation Category:Female characters in film Category:Female characters in television Category:Fictional LGBT characters in television de:Die Simpsons (Familie)#Patty Bouvier ","title":"Patty and Selma"},{"id":"1617517","text":"Richard A. Kramer (born Boston, Massachusetts, July 22, 1947) is a judge serving on the San Francisco County Superior Court. He is most known for his 2005 ruling striking down Proposition 22, a California ballot initiative defining marriage as only valid when between a man and a woman. Education and career Kramer received a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1969, graduating magna cum laude. He was graduated from the University of Southern California Law School in 1972 as a Doctor of Jurisprudence. Kramer worked as civil litigator representing the banking industry. He was appointed to the San Francisco County Superior Court by California Governor Pete Wilson in 1996. Kramer has been recognized for his ability to handle many complex cases, leading to California's Judicial Council to appoint him as the same-sex \\"Marriage Cases\\" coordinator. Marriage case and response Kramer made headlines in March 2005 when he struck down Proposition 22, a California ballot initiative defining marriage as between a man and a woman. on the grounds that it denies the \\"basic human right to marry a person of one's choice.\\" In his decision, he pointed out the \\"obvious natural and social reality that one does not have to be married in order to procreate, nor does one have to procreate in order to be married\\" and that \\"California's enactment of rights for same-sex couples belies any argument that the State would have a legitimate interest in denying marriage\\", concluding that \\"there is no rational state interest in denying them the rites of marriage as well.\\" According to a San Francisco Chronicle news article. \\"A crucial point of the ruling was the judge's conclusion that the marriage law amounts to sex discrimination, a finding that is enough to overturn virtually any California law under the state's strict constitutional standard.\\" The law makes \\"the gender of the intended spouse... the sole determining factor\\" of the legality of a marriage, Kramer said; he said claims by the law's defenders that the law treats men and women equally were no more valid than earlier claims that anti- interracial marriage laws treated whites and blacks equally.\\" The decision was not put into legal effect during the appeals process. California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger supported the status quo of domestic partnership rights, but said that he would abide by the California Supreme Court's decision and not push any constitutional amendment to override the courts. Kramer, in the words of a National Review editorial, \\"[F]inds the law's definition of marriage as the union of a man and a woman not just wrong or outdated but irrational... He has never heard of a possible reason to regard marriage as a male-female union. That view of marriage... cannot survive even the lowest level of scrutiny a judge can bring to bear on a statute.\\" National Review argued that \\"This kind of pseudo-rationalism would undermine any marriage law at all\\" because not all marriages fulfill the roles for which they were designed. The magazine considered the decision to be anti-democratic judicial activism. \\"There is no plausible argument that any provision of the state constitution was originally understood to require same-sex marriage,\\" argues the editorial. Political commentator Andrew Sullivan conceded that the decision was judicial activism, with which he is somewhat uncomfortable. Nevertheless, he applauded the decision in his blog, noting: Sullivan also noted: \\"Kramer is not a radical. He's a Catholic Republican appointed by a former Republican governor.\\" Finally, Sullivan counters the argument that the decision undermines all marriage law thus: In 2008, after the California Supreme Court reversed the appeal which had overturned Kramer's decision, essentially upholding Kramer's original decision but on different grounds, Kramer officiated some of the first same-sex weddings in San Francisco.

A daisy cutter is a type of fuse designed to detonate an aerial bomb at or above ground level. The fuse itself is a long probe affixed to the weapon's nose, which detonates the bomb if it touches the ground or any solid object. Purpose The purpose for a daisy-cutter fuse is primarily to maximize blast damage on the surface of a target. A bomb with a conventional fuse will often be driven deeply into the ground by the force of its impact, limiting the range of its blast. A bomb with a daisy-cutter fuse will detonate before it has a chance to penetrate the ground, allowing its energy to spread over a larger area. For this reason daisy-cutter fuses are often used to clear foliage and vegetation, such as for the purpose of creating landing zones for helicopters. First mention The first reference to a \\"daisy-cutter type of bomb\\" is found in the memoir of Lieutenant Jack Wilkinson in describing the 1918 attack on the Royal Air Force airfield at Bertangles. Wilkinson describes it as a \\"bomb that seemed to explode before it buried itself in the ground so that bits and pieces flew horizontally in all directions.\\"RAF Museum: J.F.C. Wilkinson, Typescript memoir, pp.285-87 =Extended nose device= Oskar Dinort invented an extended-nose fuse device known as the Dinort rod (Dinortstäbe). These were placed on the noses of German World War II-era bombs up to in mass, such as the SC 50 and 250 bombs dropped from Junkers Ju 87 (Stuka) dive bombers. Concept \\"Daisy cutter\\" fuses, when known under that exact name, were used by the United States during the Vietnam War. The concept for the fuse is attributed to an Air America employee who grasped the idea during a night of drinking. Shortly thereafter, his drinking buddy, a Royal Lao Air Force airman at Louang Phrabang, gathered the needed materials for the prototype and started welding used aircraft gun barrels directly into the nose fuse cavity of bombs. After the concept proved itself useful it was made famous by being used for the largest conventional bomb in the U.S. military's arsenal at the time, the BLU-82. When used gun barrels were in short supply, water pipes were requisitioned for the task. The welded pipe versions had several adverse effects, such as vibration, pipe weld separation or breakage while in flight, and wind drag, due to impossibility of aligning the pipes correctly with the nose of the weapon, so that phase of development eventually gave way to threaded steel water pipes screwed into the nose cavity of the bombs, leaving only the tail fuse for detonation. After the war more precise fuses were created for this purpose. These weapons were used in the \\"shock and awe\\" phase of the Iraq War.

Extensibility is a measure of the ability to extend a system and the level of effort required to implement the extension. Extensions can be through the addition of new functionality or through modification of existing functionality. The principle provides for enhancements without impairing existing system functions. An extensible system is one whose internal structure and dataflow are minimally or not affected by new or modified functionality, for example recompiling or changing the original source code might be unnecessary when changing a system’s behavior, either by the creator or other programmers.Johansson, Niklas, and Anton Löfgren.

University of Gothenburg Department of Applied Information Technology, 29 May 2009. Web. 26 Apr. 2014. . Because software systems are long lived and will be modified for new features and added functionalities demanded by users, extensibility enables developers to expand or add to the software’s capabilities and facilitates systematic reuse. Some of its approaches include facilities for allowing users’ own program routines to be inserted and the abilities to define new data types as well as to define new formatting markup tags.Rouse, Margaret. \\"Extensible.\\" SearchSAO. N.p., Mar. 2007. Web. 27 Apr. 2014. . Extensible design Extensible design in software engineering is to accept that not everything can be designed in advance. A light software framework which allows for changes is provided instead. Small commands are made to prevent losing the element of extensibility, following the principle of separating work elements into comprehensible units, in order to avoid traditional software development issues including low cohesion and high coupling and allow for continued development. Embracing change is essential to the extensible design, in which additions will be continual. Each chunk of the system will be workable with any changes, and the idea of change through addition is the center of the whole system design. Extensible design supports frequent re-prioritization and allows functionality to be implemented in small steps upon request, which are the principles advocated by the Agile methodologies and iterative development. Extensibility imposes fewer and cleaner dependencies during development, as well as reduced coupling and more cohesive abstractions, plus well defined interfaces.Kelly, Allan. \\"The Philosophy of Extensible Software.\\" ACCU-Professionalism in Programming (2002): Web. 27 Apr. 2014. . Importance Fickleness lies at the basis of all software because of human phenomena since software is an “evolving entity” which is developed and maintained by human beings, yielding ongoing system changes in software specification and implementation. Components of a software are often developed and deployed by unrelated parties independently. Adaptable software components are necessary since components from external vendors are unlikely to fit into a specific deployment scenario off-the-rack, taking third party users other than the manufacturer into consideration. Many software systems and software product-lines are derived from a base system, which share a common software architecture or sometimes large parts of the functionality and implementation but are possibly equipped with different components that require an extensible base system.Zenger, Matthias. \\"1.2 Characteristics of Extensibility Mechanisms.\\" Programming Language Abstractions for Extensible Software Components.

Classification of extensibility mechanisms There are three different forms of software extensibility: white-box extensibility, gray-box extensibility, and black-box extensibility, which are based on what artifacts and the way they are changed. =White-Box = Under this form of extensibility, a software system can be extended by modifying the source code, and it is the most flexible and the least restrictive form. There are two sub-forms of extensibility, open-box extensibility and glass-box extensibility, depending on how changes are applied.  Open-Box  Changes are performed invasively in open-box extensible systems; i.e. original source code is directly being hacked into. It requires available source code and the modification permitted source code license. Open-box extensibility is most relevant to bug fixing, internal code refactoring, or production of next version of a software product.  Glass-Box  Glass-box extensibility (also called architecture driven frameworks) allows a software system to be extended with available source code, but may not allow the code to be modified. Extensions have to be separated from the original system in a way that the original system is not affected. One example of this form of extensibility is object-oriented application frameworks which achieve extensibility typically by using inheritance and dynamic binding. =Black-Box = In black-box extensibility (also called data-driven frameworks) no details about a system’s implementation are used for implementing deployments or extensions; only interface specifications are provided. This type of approach is more limited than the various white-box approaches. Black-box extensions are typically achieved through system configuration applications or the use of application-specific scripting languages by defining components interfaces. =Gray-Box = Gray-box extensibility is a compromise between a pure white- box and a pure black-box approach, which does not rely fully on the exposure of source code. Programmers could be given the system’s specialization interface which lists all available abstractions for refinement and specifications on how extensions should be developed.Zenger, Matthias. \\"1.3 Classification of Extensibility Mechanisms.\\" Programming Language Abstractions for Extensible Software Components. Lausanne: Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, 2004. N. pag. Web. 26 Apr. 2014. Extensibility vs. reusability Extensibility and reusability have many emphasized properties in common, including low coupling, modularity and high risk elements’ ability to construct for many different software systems, which is motivated by the observation of software systems often sharing common elements. Reusability together with extensibility allows a technology to be transferred to another project with less development and maintenance time, as well as enhanced reliability and consistency.Zenger, Matthias. \\"1.1.1 Reusability.\\" Programming Language Abstractions for Extensible Software Components.

It was shown first in the United Kingdom on ITV (as a Tonight special) on 3 February 2003, and in the United States 3 days later on ABC, introduced by Barbara Walters. Summary Living with Michael Jackson begins at Neverland Ranch, where Michael Jackson and Martin Bashir tour the estate's grounds and face off in a race car match. Later, he explains that he writes the songs by composing lyrics and not the music, because the music \\"will write itself.\\" Upon being requested by Bashir, he demonstrates that through dancing, he becomes the physical embodiment of the music. Afterwards Jackson admits that the house's theme of Peter Pan is so inspirational, because he feels he is Pan. They go out to the Giving Tree, a tree in which Jackson gets inspiration to write his songs. While watching footage of the Jackson 5, he gets emotional upon recalling how his father Joe would watch his sons rehearse the dance steps with a belt in his hand. He states that he felt a deep fear of his father, and that is why he never laid a hand on his children. Bashir notes that this must have left a deep impact on the young Michael. After Neverland, Bashir followed him to the Four Seasons Hotel in Las Vegas. In Las Vegas, Jackson spoke about his love life, his changing appearance, and his children. When Bashir inquires if he had any girlfriends when he was young, Jackson recounts a time when one- time girlfriend Tatum O'Neal wanted to make love to him, but he backed down because he was not ready. Bashir and Jackson also visited a shopping center where Jackson reportedly spent over a million dollars in one store on furniture for a new house. The subject of his changing appearance is brought up, but an agitated Jackson denies deliberately bleaching his skin, getting implants in his cheeks, having a cleft put in his chin, having his lips enlarged, or getting his eyelids reconstructed, claiming that the media is ignorant of what they do not understand. Jackson mentions he suffered horrible bouts of acne as a teenager, and his father would repeatedly insult him by making fun of his nose. Afterward, Bashir gets to meet the Jackson children Prince and Paris, who wore masks to conceal their appearance. Jackson then went to Berlin, Germany. This is where the \\"baby dangling\\" incident occurred. Jackson also visited Berlin Zoo and a charity auction, and received a humanitarian award at the Bambi Awards. Back in Neverland, Jackson reveals to Bashir that not only does he invite disadvantaged children to his ranch, he lets them stay in his bed while he sleeps on the floor. Gavin Arvizo is also interviewed and states that it was Jackson's support that helped him beat his bout with cancer. Jackson admits that sometimes when Gavin stayed with him, Jackson let him have the bed while he slept on the floor. When asked what he gets out of his involvement with children, the singer replies that he gains joy, because \\"my greatest inspiration comes from kids\\". After this, Bashir says he feels uneasy about what he views as an apparent obsession with children. He says that he will have to confront Jackson on certain areas of his life about which he feels he had been less than honest. During January 2003, Bashir meets with Jackson in Miami for the final interview and brings up the subject of his face. A visibly upset Jackson says that he has only had two operations on his nose in order to facilitate his singing, to which Bashir tries to ask how he looks so much different from when he was an adolescent. After the singer states that there is nothing wrong with plastic surgery, and that it was \\"not invented for Michael Jackson,\\" Bashir comes to the conclusion that Jackson wanted to change his appearance as a result of his troubled youth and father's insults. When he asks about a comment Jackson's son Prince made that \\"I haven't got a mother,\\" Jackson tells him that Deborah Rowe bore his two children as a gift for him, because he wanted to be a father so badly. On the subject of Blanket's mother, Jackson contradicts his earlier statement that he had Blanket with a woman with whom he had a relationship by stating that Blanket's mother was a surrogate mother and that they did not know each other. Bashir also repeatedly questions Jackson why he invites children into his room. Jackson defended himself stating that such activity is natural when the children are of close friends or family, and that \\"many children,\\" including the Culkin family children (Macaulay and Kieran) have slept in the same bed as him. Jackson strongly denied that there was any sexual motivation for this. During these defensive comments he also stated that he would allow his children to stay with his friends including Barry Gibb, saying that they are \\"sweet people\\" and are not \\"Jack the Ripper\\". ReceptionCriticism= Michael Jackson felt betrayed by Martin Bashir and complained that the film gives a distorted picture of his behavior and conduct as a father. He said that in the final version of his interview, Bashir used only material that supported the negative view Bashir was portrayed as holding towards Jackson. In response, Jackson and his personal cameraman released a rebuttal interview, which showed Bashir complimenting Jackson on his abilities as a father and his grace under pressure. \\"I haven't seen that documentary,\\" remarked Madonna, \\"but it sounds disgusting, like Bashir exploited a friendship. Publicly humiliating someone for your own gain will only come back to haunt you. I can assure you, all these people will be sorry. God's going to have his revenge.\\" Bashir stated: \\"I don't believe that I've betrayed Michael Jackson at all. I agreed that we would make an honest film about his life. The film was fair to his musical achievement and gave him every opportunity to explain himself. I'm not accusing anybody of being a child molester or a paedophile.\\" Following Jackson's death in 2009, Bashir said Jackson \\"was never convicted of any crime, and I never saw any wrongdoing myself.\\" =Rebuttal video= In an attempt to repair his image following the Martin Bashir interview, Michael Jackson released a second interview, called Take Two: The Footage You Were Never Meant to See (also referred to as \\"the rebuttal video\\"), which was seen on Fox in the United States. This was presented by Maury Povich and contains material which Bashir omitted. It also features new interviews with people close to Jackson, such as his former wife Debbie Rowe, parents Joseph and Katherine, brother Jermaine and close friend Elizabeth Taylor. In this interview, she claimed it was on her request that the children wore masks in public. She also pointed out that the concept of \\"sharing a bed\\" can be misunderstood: for example, she herself likes watching television in bed; when she has a visitor, they both watch television together in bed. It also contains interviews with Bashir giving much different opinions than he gave in past interviews as well as in the voice-overs. He is shown praising Jackson as a father as well as saying that he thinks it is wonderful that he allows children to come to Neverland, though he had made previous statements that Neverland Ranch was a \\"dangerous place\\" for children. The footage that they show in this documentary was filmed by Hamid Moslehi privately. He states that he was not \\"secretly\\" videotaping the interviews, as was popularly believed. He said Bashir knew they were also filming, but that Bashir probably did not know that when he told his camera crew to cut, that he was still filming. Part of the footage was not aired because videographer Hamid Moslehi refused to hand it over, owing to a financial dispute with Jackson. It was found by police in a search of Moslehi's home in November 2003, and showed the accuser's family praising Jackson. Bashir said a 16-second clip was being used to portray him as being unfair when he had interviewed Jackson for more than 10 hours. =Ratings= The UK airing had 15 million viewers while 38 million watched the 2-hour special on ABC. =Parody = On 14 March 2003, BBC produced a special spoof parody of the documentary entitled \\"Lying to Michael Jackson\\". The sketch showed Michael Jackson played by comedian Lenny Henry being interviewed and followed around for the documentary by Martin Bashir played by Rowan Atkinson.

Background Philip Joel Urry was born in Auckland, New Zealand. He was lead singer and guitarist of the popular New Zealand band Drinkwater. Although he had little experience with the instrument, the Newsboys offered him a position as bassist in August 1994. He also sang background and some lead vocals for the band. In June 2000, he released his first solo album, Watching Over You, on Inpop Records. This release was largely autobiographical. He supported this album with the Strangely Normal Tour accompanied by LaRue, Luna Halo, Earthsuit, V*Enna & Katy Hudson (now known as Katy Perry). Newsboys at the 2001 National Lutheran Youth Gathering, with Phil Joel in the foreground His second solo album, Bring It On, was released in November 2002 also on Inpop. His third album, The deliberatePeople. album was released on 18 November 2005 in conjunction with Phil and Heather Joel's newly founded Christian ministry, deliberatePeople. The album was praised for its stripped down rock, reminiscent of the Jesus Music era of Christian Music. His wife, Heather, is a former host of All Access and Hit Trip on CMT. He met Heather at a radio station in her native Kansas when he'd only been in the country six weeks. They were married in 1996 and have two children. In December 2006, Joel announced that he would be leaving the Newsboys in order to devote more time to his family. In September 2008, Joel released his fifth solo CD titled The New Normal, which was his third self-produced album. When Phil left Newsboys after 13 years, it wasn’t long before the phone started ringing and ministry opportunities began to emerge throughout the United States, New Zealand, Australia and even China. \\"Early on, I was asked to lead worship for a series of youth conferences. At first I wasn’t sure if I was the man for the job. I knew I wanted to be involved in more hands-on ministry, but worship leading wasn’t on my radar.\\" His experiences at these youth conferences ended up igniting a passion in him for the next generation, and in 2011 the foundation for his current project, Zealand, was laid at one such conference. Since then Zealand has taken part in major tours and festivals across the country, while continuing to make youth camps and conferences their priority. In December 2017 it was announced that Joel would be joining his former Newsboys band mates on the year-long Newsboys United tour, where he would be pulling double duty, performing a full set with Newsboys, as well as Zealand. Joel's debut book, Redwoods & Whales, was released by Thomas Nelson on 16 April 2019. DiscographyZealand Worship= *Zealand Worship - The EP (Word Records/Warner Bros.

He was a Professor of English Philology at Johns Hopkins University, and specialized in early Germanic languages and Old and Middle English specifically. Biography Bright completed his undergraduate education at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania. During the 1861-1862 school year, a competition was initiated at the school to find the member of the senior class \\"deemed to be the most proficient in English Philology as demonstrated by a written discussion of the language of some English classic.\\" This competition was called the Fowler Prize, named after famed scholar William Chauncey Fowler who was a friend of the school and created the prize and its $30 reward. In 1876, during the time Bright attended Lafayette, the subject of the prize was the study of American poet William Cullen Bryant. Bright competed in, and won the Fowler Prize this year, and during commencement was awarded the prize by Bryant himself at the graduation ceremony. Bright was the first person to receive a Ph.D. in English from Johns Hopkins, in 1882. After teaching briefly at Cornell, he returned to Johns Hopkins in 1885, where he oversaw the development of the English program. Bright became the first occupant of the Caroline Donovan Chair of English, which was established in 1905. He held the chair until his retirement in 1925. His successor as Chairman (though not as Donovan Professor) was John Calvin French. Among Bright's publications was an Anglo-Saxon Reader, whose similarity to the reader published by the more well-known British philologist Henry Sweet prompted Sweet to remark that Bright's work \\"bears a striking resemblance to an earlier version of my Reader.\\" =The James Wilson Bright Collection at Goucher College= Bright's 4,000 volume teaching collection of Anglo-Saxon, Middle English, and Early Modern English texts was bought by Goucher College in Baltimore, MD shortly before his death in 1926.

Originally developed from the British World War II-era Tallboy bomb to be dropped from the Convair B-36 bomber, it weighed 10,000 lb (4,500 kg) and contained an 8,050 lb (3,650 kg) Tritonal warhead. Production of the M121 ceased in 1955, but stockpiles were retained until the Vietnam War. Vietnam War In December 1967, the U.S. Air Force began a testing program to use large bombs for explosively clearing jungle areas for landing of helicopters. After tests in the United States, the U.S. Army began dropping the bombs using CH-54 helicopters. Use of the helicopters was expensive, time consuming and inefficient due to the CH-54's limited range. In October 1968, a C-130 crew from the 29th Tactical Airlift Squadron of the 463rd Tactical Airlift Wing flew a series of test drops while under the guidance of MSQ-77 radar controllers; additional test drops were made in December. In March 1969, the 463rd commenced Project Commando Vault, and bomb drops became a regular occurrence. Besides clearing the jungle and preventing the ambush of helicopters that were approaching the landing zone (the M121's blast diameter was 60 meters), the explosion also stunned the NVA or Viet Cong personnel within 500 meters and revealed or destroyed booby traps in the landing area.Frankum, Roland Bruce. Like rolling thunder: the air war in Vietnam, 1964-1975. Rowman & Littlefield, 2005. . Due to the bomb's weight and powerful effects, ordinance handlers would chalk mark the bombs as \\"Excedrin Headache #10,00x\\" where x was the sequence number of the bomb;John Brennan, Chris Evans. Vietnam War Helicopter Art: U.S. Army Rotor Aircraft. Stackpole Books, 2012. . a reference to the well known (at the time) advertising campaign promoting the efficacy of the Excedrin brand of extra strength pain relievers. Use of the M121 to clear a jungle zone was a technical success, but the weapon did not satisfy MACV's command requirement to clear a jungle area for five helicopters at the same time.Thigpen, Jerry L. The Praetorian STARShip: the untold story of the Combat Talon. DIANE Publishing, 2001. Despite this, the United States continued to use the M121 to clear helicopter landing zones in the jungle until stockpiles were depleted while a more powerful bomb was developed for jungle-clearing purposes. The new BLU-82, developed in 1969, entered service later in the Commando Vault program. Unlike the M121, which used TNT, the BLU-82 used a slurry mixture of ammonium nitrate and powdered aluminum. It had a slightly bigger blast diameter (80 meters).

The name refers to Donald Duck and was first used by author Jon Gisle in his essay Donaldismen from 1971 and expanded in his book Donaldismen in 1973. In some (especially European) countries, donaldism is mainly centred on comics and comic strips, while in other countries, e.g. the US, these are largely neglected while motion pictures and shorts are relatively much more popular. Originally the term, as defined by Gisle, referred to a \\"Research branch as well as the material that is the object this research. In the latter meaning, the word denotes every Disney signed comic story. In the former meaning, donaldism is a branch of comics research, specialising in the study of precisely Disney's production.\\" While this original meaning of the word was defined in 1973, today donaldism tends to also cover general fandom within Disney comics and even motion pictures and shorts. Although the term refers directly to the Duck universe, it includes other Disney universes.  Donaldist  A donaldist is a supporter of donaldism: a fan or researcher of Disney comics. According to the 1977 manifest of Norwegian donaldist society \\"Donaldistene\\", \\"donaldists are Donald Duck fans who study Donald Duck & Co [Norwegian Disney comic book, editor] from social and political structures and viewpoints. Moreover, they try in the best possible way to preserve donaldistic cultural material for their own and others' collections.\\" Part of Donaldist culture is to create backronyms for names and titles; this usage stems from Carl Barks's Junior Woodchucks comics, where the scout leaders generally had long and pompous titles, leading to jocular acronyms. The term Donaldist has been used in authorized Disney publications: the collector- themed Gemstone Publishing album series Walt Disney Treasures was advertised with the slogan/question, \\"Are You a Donaldist?\\"  Donaldistic research  One of the first, important discoveries was in 1960 when U.S. American fan John Spicer wrote the first fan letter to Carl Barks, to which Barks replied. Until then, Walt Disney was thought to have drawn and written all comics himself, although fans suspected otherwise. It was later discovered that Disney himself had only been involved in the production of a handful of comics. In 1973 Jon Gisle published the Donald Duck analysis Donaldismen. En muntert-vitenskapelig studie over Donald Duck og hans verden. Donaldistic research is still being performed, although generally at a lower frequency than in the 1970s and '80s. Research results today are typically presented in fanzines or in Internet websites. = Denmark = Although Gisle's book was translated into Danish with the title \\"Andeologien\\" (\\"The Donald / Duck -ology\\"), after Donald's Danish name \\"Anders And\\", currently the Norwegian/international term \\"donaldism\\" is the most commonly used. In Denmark, one of the main sources for donaldistic research and other donaldistic articles is Carl Barks & Co., with Freddy Milton as editor and main driving force. The first issue was published in 1974, and the fanzine continued until 2000 at a varied frequency; sometimes several issues per year, sometimes years passed without an issue. The fanzine presented much donaldistic research, including a large index of Danish Disney comic books (which is now maintained by the Inducks project and the original authors). Despite its name, the fanzine contained material on various fields within Disney comics, but still with an overweight on material about Carl Barks, the passing of whom unleashed the discontinuation of the fanzine. In 2001 a Danish donaldistic society (Dansk Donaldist-Forening in Danish) was formed by a group of Danish donaldists and the following year the first issue of their fanzine DDF(R)appet was published. DDF(R)appet has a publication frequency of approximately two issues per year, and among its articles are a few research presentations. Other notable (comics) fanzines which are not donaldistic as such but still carry donaldistic material from time to time are: Nørd-nyt, Rackham, Seriejournalen, and Strip!. = Finland = In Finnish donaldism has the title (from Finnish ankka, \\"duck\\"). Prominent donaldists in the country have included comic book writer Timo Ronkainen, founder of the fanzine Ankkalinnan pamaus, and Markku Kivekäs, the long-time (1988-2007) editor of Aku Ankka.https://suomenkuvalehti.fi/jutut/kulttuuri/ankisti-markku-kivekas- on-kuollut/https://www.hs.fi/paivanlehti/28052018/art-2000005696862.html = Germany = D.O.N.A.L.D. (Deutsche Organisation nichtkommerzieller Anhänger des lauteren Donaldismus or the German Organization of Non-commercial Devotees of Pure Donaldism) is the donaldistic society of Germany. Founded by Hans von Storch, it has presented many contributions to donaldistic research through its fanzine Der Donaldist. It also holds several meetings and one congress each year. Donaldists have risen in rank and are actively infiltrating the culture pages of several important newspapers in Germany, such as the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, where they subtly install quotations easily recognisable to fans of the comics. The German study of Donaldism is decisively influenced by the German translations of Barks's comic books by Erika Fuchs. They were also influential when the Museum for Comic and Language-Art, called Erika-Fuchs-Haus was opened in Schwarzenbach an der Saale, Fuchs' main living place, in 2015. = Norway = Donaldisten (The Donaldist)  In the homeland of donaldism, Norway, the fanzine Donaldisten (The Donaldist) has been published since 1973. The donaldistic society Gammeldonaldismens Venner (Friends of the Early Donaldism), founded 1975, issued Donaldisten in the years 1975–88. Focusing on Jon Gisle's definition of donaldism, the issues contain many research results. In 1995 publication of Donaldisten was continued by a new society, Donaldistene (The Donaldists), but after only one issue, a nine-year time span passed until another issue was published in 2004. The new society focuses less on research, mirroring a general change among donaldists. Mid 2007, Donaldistene still have only published two issues of Donaldisten, though.  Other fanzines  March 2007 a new Norwegian fanzine about donaldism entitled Kvakk! (Quack!) was announced, which will bring articles, interviews, and reviews. Behind the fanzine are the same persons who also maintain Norway's most popular website on Disney comics, Andeby Online (Duckburg Online). The first issue will be out in the summer of 2007, and after that there will be four issues released every year. * Carl Barks and The Old Master's Secret (1976, one issue) * Duckmite (1979, one issue) * Duckburg (1981–82, four issues)  University research  Tore Ismanto Hofstad wrote about the role of religion in Donald Duck comics in his thesis for his master's degree at the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.Adresseavisen: Kristne ender i Andeby (In Norwegian) = Sweden = Sweden has a long tradition of publishing donaldistic research and other articles in their fanzine NAFS(K)URIREN since 1977. The fanzine is published once or twice a year by the Swedish donaldistic society, NAFS(K) (Nationella Ankistförbundet i Sverige (kvack)) or The Swedish National Donaldism Society (quack)), founded on September 21, 1976.

She represented Ward 16, one of two municipal wards enclosed within the federal-provincial riding of Eglinton—Lawrence. She was Chair of the Toronto Transit Commission from 2010 until February 2014 when she stepped down in order to run for mayor.\\"TTC marks its 90th anniversary\\" TTC news release, September 1, 2011\\"The defiant outsider inside T.O. City Hall\\" Background Born and raised in North York, Karen Stintz is a Toronto resident. She went to St. Joseph's Morrow Park Catholic Secondary School. After receiving a BA from University of Western Ontario, she obtained a Master of Science degree in Journalism from Boston University and worked briefly as a journalist. Returning to school, she received a Master of Public Administration degree from Queen's University, and was hired by the Ontario Ministry of Health. Before being elected to council, she acquired seven years of experience in the public and private sectors, managing and delivering multimillion-dollar programs in the healthcare sector. Her parents are Henry Stintz, a NASA engineer and Barbara Bear. In 1999, she married software executive Darryl Parisien. She and her husband live in the Lawrence Park neighbourhood with their two children. Politics In March 2009, Stintz came under some scrutiny when it was revealed that she spent $4,500 of her councillor's office budget on voice lessons. She did so after being told \\"she speaks too fast and that her message is being lost as a result.\\" She said that the lessons improved her speaking during council meetings. In 2009, Stintz was one of the leaders of the Responsible Government Group centre-right caucus on City Council which opposed the policies of Mayor David Miller. The group opposed Mayor Miller's handling of the 2009 City Workers’ strike. As the City Councillor for Ward 16, Stintz initiated and supported a wide array of initiatives to improve the community of Eglinton-Lawrence. To deter graffiti, Ward 16's youth were recruited to create murals in the Anne Rawson Laneway, Duplex Parkette and Eglinton Park field house. When a development was proposed at 1717 Avenue Road, urban design guidelines were created. This established the framework needed for constructive dialogue for development in the community. By supporting Orchard View Pedestrian Square, Stintz not only assisted in bringing increased pedestrian safety to a dangerous intersection, but found a new home for the local farmers market. This Square has received \\"overwhelming positive support\\". With the \\"Can the Trash Contest\\", students from schools across the ward were asked to create posters that illustrated the various reasons for why we should all \\"can the trash.\\" When disagreements arose from the use of public spaces, Stintz played an active role in resolving the issues. This included finding equitable ice time for those who use the ice rinks in North Toronto, finding space for dog owners to walk their dogs off- leash in a way that did not interfere with other residents and being part of the revitalization of the parks in Ward 16. In April 2009, Stintz accused Mayor David Miller of lying during a debate about payroll costs. Miller said \\"I know a group of you went up to see the minister and... asked for a $25,000 grant in order to study political parties in the city of Toronto,\\". Stintz retorted, \\"I'm actually shocked that you would... so blatantly lie,\\". Stintz later produced a document addressed to Municipal Affairs Minister Jim Watson and titled, Next Steps for the Strong Mayor Model in the Toronto Context. A spokesman for the minister said the request was for a \\"study of city hall governance that would have included a look at political parties.\\" =Chair of the Toronto Transit Commission= In 2010, Stintz was appointed to the position as Chair of the Toronto Transit Commission with the support of Mayor Rob Ford. During her time as Chair, the TTC introduced a \\"Customer Charter\\" which included: posting performance reports on TTC surface routes, an annual TTC Town Hall, 6 Twitter Town Halls per year and 5 \\"Meet the Manager\\" events where customers can engage with senior TTC staff. As Chair, 153 articulated buses were added to the fleet and new subway cars were placed on the Yonge- University-Spadina line. Customer service operating hours were extended to make assistance available 7 days a week from 7am-10pm. A new position of \\"TTC Station Manager\\" was created to improve accountability to customers while more next vehicle arrival screens and debit and credit card payment systems were made available. In addition, a suicide prevention program was launched with the help of Toronto Distress Centres and Bell Canada and she oversaw the approval of Presto's introduction to the TTC. The TTC also began the introduction of WiFi services in its stations. During her time as Chair, the TTC also approved a number of measures to improve the commission's fiscal imbalance. The TTC made decisions to balance its budget while also reducing the government subsidy received by 10%. This included a process to realign services to match revenue and negotiating new fuel contracts to save the TTC $23.5 million between 2010-2012 and an estimated $30 million from 2013–2014. By agreeing to a new benefits package, and reducing administrative staff, an additional $18.5 million was saved while Stintz served as Chair. By successfully contracting out bus and washroom cleaning services and leasing the Toronto Coach Terminal, a further $4.9 million was saved. = Restructuring TTC Board = Stintz successfully moved a motion in March 2012 at City Council to remove 5 City councillors from the TTC Board, who were all Rob Ford supporters,( Vincent Crisanti, Frank Di Giorgio, Norm Kelly, Cesar Palacio and Denzil Minnan-Wong ). The 5 councillors, who constituted a majority of the TTC Board, had voted to terminate the services of the TTC General Manager Gary Webster.https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/mayor-loses-as-ttc-board- restructured/article551600/ Toronto City Council expanded the TTC Board in 2012, on Stintz' recommendation, from nine councillors to an 11-member body with seven councillors plus four citizen members.https://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2012/03/05/ttc_ford_loyalists_booted_stintz_stays_as_chair_in_expanded_board.html =Undercover Boss= Concerned about budget cuts and negative public perception of the TTC, Stintz revealed on an episode of the show Undercover Boss that aired February 16, 2012 on W Network that she had gone undercover at the TTC for a week in 2011. Changing her appearance and posing as \\"Ruth Bear\\", a newly hired TTC trainee, she shadowed a subway train operator, an upholsterer, a station caretaker, and a night shift bus serviceperson, trying each of their respective jobs (for the subway operator, she used a simulator instead). Afterward, she revealed her true identity to those employees, that she understood and valued their work, and their ideas on how TTC riders could help them. She had hoped to gain an idea what could be cut and what should not be, and saw the front-line employees as the best source. =2014 mayoral race= On October 27, 2013, Stintz announced that she would run for mayor in 2014. She said, \\"I believe in the fiscal agenda of Rob Ford, but I worry that another four years of Rob Ford may not move the city forward. And I want to continue to build our city.\\" After stepping down as TTC chair in February, registered as a candidate on February 24, 2014. The Karen Stintz campaign will focus on fighting congestion, creating safe neighbourhoods and building strong communities. Some of her proposals are a \\"downtown relief subway line, reform the land transfer tax, [and] a joint Toronto-U.S. bid for the 2026 World Cup and explore a 'hybrid' solution for the eastern part of the Gardiner Expressway.\\" On August 21, 2014 Stintz announced she was dropping out of the race and would not seek re-election as city councillor.https://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/toronto2014election/2014/08/21/karen_stintz_to_make_announcement_after_no_comment_on_remaining_in_mayoral_race.html Post-political career In late August 2014, after withdrawing from the mayoral election, Stintz expressed interest in becoming Commissioner of the Canadian Football League when the position was to become vacant in April 2015. When this opportunity did not pan out, Stintz was appointed as the Executive Director of ArtsBuild Ontario – a nonprofit arts service organization dedicated to realizing long-term solutions for building, managing and financing sustainable arts facilities needed in Ontario communities.http://www.insidetoronto.com/news-story/5527230-karen-stintz-has- new-gig-with-arts-organization In November 2015, Stintz was named Variety Village President and CEO for an 18-month term.

The equations are named after the American physicist Percy Williams Bridgman. (See also the exact differential article for general differential relationships). The extensive variables of the system are fundamental. Only the entropy S , the volume V and the four most common thermodynamic potentials will be considered. The four most common thermodynamic potentials are: :{ -----  Internal energy  U -----  Enthalpy  H -----  Helmholtz free energy  A -----  Gibbs free energy  G ----- } The first derivatives of the internal energy with respect to its (extensive) natural variables S and V yields the intensive parameters of the system - The pressure P and the temperature T . For a simple system in which the particle numbers are constant, the second derivatives of the thermodynamic potentials can all be expressed in terms of only three material properties :{ -----  heat capacity (constant pressure)  CP -----  Coefficient of thermal expansion  α -----  Isothermal compressibility  βT } Bridgman's equations are a series of relationships between all of the above quantities.  Introduction  Many thermodynamic equations are expressed in terms of partial derivatives. For example, the expression for the heat capacity at constant pressure is: :C_P=\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial T}\\\\right)_P which is the partial derivative of the enthalpy with respect to temperature while holding pressure constant. We may write this equation as: :C_P=\\\\frac{(\\\\partial H)_P}{(\\\\partial T)_P} This method of rewriting the partial derivative was described by Bridgman (and also Lewis & Randall), and allows the use of the following collection of expressions to express many thermodynamic equations. For example from the equations below we have: :(\\\\partial H)_P=C_P and :(\\\\partial T)_P=1 Dividing, we recover the proper expression for CP. The following summary restates various partial terms in terms of the thermodynamic potentials, the state parameters S, T, P, V, and the following three material properties which are easily measured experimentally. :\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial T}\\\\right)_P = \\\\alpha V :\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial P}\\\\right)_T = -\\\\beta_T V :\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial T}\\\\right)_P = C_P = c_P N  Bridgman's thermodynamic equations Note that Lewis and Randall use F and E for the Gibbs energy and internal energy, respectively, rather than G and U which are used in this article. : (\\\\partial T)_P=-(\\\\partial P)_T=1 : (\\\\partial V)_P=-(\\\\partial P)_V=\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial T}\\\\right)_P : (\\\\partial S)_P=-(\\\\partial P)_S=\\\\frac{C_p}{T} : (\\\\partial U)_P=-(\\\\partial P)_U=C_P-P\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial T}\\\\right)_P : (\\\\partial H)_P=-(\\\\partial P)_H=C_P : (\\\\partial G)_P=-(\\\\partial P)_G=-S : (\\\\partial A)_P=-(\\\\partial P)_A=-S-P\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial T}\\\\right)_P : (\\\\partial V)_T=-(\\\\partial T)_V=-\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial P}\\\\right)_T : (\\\\partial S)_T=-(\\\\partial T)_S=\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial T}\\\\right)_P : (\\\\partial U)_T=-(\\\\partial T)_U=T\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial T}\\\\right)_P+P\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial P}\\\\right)_T : (\\\\partial H)_T=-(\\\\partial T)_H=-V+T\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial T}\\\\right)_P : (\\\\partial G)_T=-(\\\\partial T)_G=-V : (\\\\partial A)_T=-(\\\\partial T)_A=P\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial P}\\\\right)_T : (\\\\partial S)_V=-(\\\\partial V)_S=\\\\frac{C_P}{T}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial P}\\\\right)_T+\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial T}\\\\right)_P^2 : (\\\\partial U)_V=-(\\\\partial V)_U=C_P\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial P}\\\\right)_T+T\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial T}\\\\right)_P^2 : (\\\\partial H)_V=-(\\\\partial V)_H=C_P\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial P}\\\\right)_T+T\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial T}\\\\right)_P^2-V\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial T}\\\\right)_P : (\\\\partial G)_V=-(\\\\partial V)_G=-V\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial T}\\\\right)_P-S\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial P}\\\\right)_T : (\\\\partial A)_V=-(\\\\partial V)_A=-S\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial P}\\\\right)_T : (\\\\partial U)_S=-(\\\\partial S)_U=\\\\frac{PC_P}{T}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial P}\\\\right)_T+P\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial T}\\\\right)_P^2 : (\\\\partial H)_S=-(\\\\partial S)_H=-\\\\frac{VC_P}{T} : (\\\\partial G)_S=-(\\\\partial S)_G=-\\\\frac{VC_P}{T}+S\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial T}\\\\right)_P : (\\\\partial A)_S=-(\\\\partial S)_A=\\\\frac{PC_P}{T}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial P}\\\\right)_T+P\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial T}\\\\right)_P^2+S\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial T}\\\\right)_P : (\\\\partial H)_U=-(\\\\partial U)_H=-VC_P+PV\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial T}\\\\right)_P- PC_P\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial P}\\\\right)_T-PT\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial T}\\\\right)_P^2 : (\\\\partial G)_U=-(\\\\partial U)_G=-VC_P+PV\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial T}\\\\right)_P+ST\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial T}\\\\right)_P+SP\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial P}\\\\right)_T : (\\\\partial A)_U=-(\\\\partial U)_A=P(C_P+S)\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial P}\\\\right)_T+PT\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial T}\\\\right)_P^2+ST\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial T}\\\\right)_P : (\\\\partial G)_H=-(\\\\partial H)_G=-V(C_P+S)+TS\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial T}\\\\right)_P : (\\\\partial A)_H=-(\\\\partial H)_A=-\\\\left[S+P\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial T}\\\\right)_P\\\\right]\\\\left[V-T\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial T}\\\\right)_P\\\\right]+PC_P\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial P}\\\\right)_T : (\\\\partial A)_G=-(\\\\partial G)_A=-S\\\\left[V+P\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial P}\\\\right)_T\\\\right]-PV\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial T}\\\\right)_P See also * Table of thermodynamic equations References * * Category:Thermodynamic equations Category:Equations ","title":"Bridgman's thermodynamic equations"},{"id":"1617559","text":"The New York University College of Arts & Science (CAS) is the primary liberal arts college of New York University (NYU). The school is located near Gould Plaza next to the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences and the Stern School of Business, within 2 miles of Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village. As the oldest and largest college within NYU, the College of Arts & Science currently enrolls 7,660 undergraduate students (as of 2017). CAS enrolls the largest number of undergraduate students for a private liberal arts college in the United States; its size and complexity owe to NYU’s overall profile of enrolling the largest number of students in the country for a private, nonprofit, residential, and nonsectarian institution of higher education. The College of Arts & Science offers Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) and Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degrees. In the 2020 QS World University Rankings, NYU was ranked 1st in Philosophy, 10th in Mathematics, and 15th in English Language and Literature.https://www.topuniversities.com/node/294786/ranking- details/university-subject-rankings/--2017/philosophy Admission to the College of Arts & Science is highly competitive with an acceptance rate of 9% for the class of 2023.

Additionally, students may select from over 60 minors offered within the College as well as 40 cross-school minors at other colleges within NYU.  Student life  Clubs and traditions = The school also hosts multiple student organizations, including greek life, political, religious, ethnic, and music performance groups (often alongside the Tisch School of Arts). The university also sponsors some traditions for undergraduates including Apple Fest, the Violet Ball, Strawberry Festival, and the semi-annual midnight breakfast where Student Affairs administrators serve free breakfast to students before finals. = Publications and journalism clubs = The College of Arts and Science runs several student journalism clubs and publication with the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute, including Washington Square News, NYU Local, Washington Square Local, and the literary journals Washington Square Review and The Minetta Review. The university also associated (though not officially affiliated) with the campus comedy magazine, The Plague, which started to poke fun at popular culture as well as campus life and the idiosyncrasies of NYU in 1978. The university also runs a radio station WNYU-FM 89.1, which broadcasts to the entire New York metropolitan area. = Secret societies = Several undergraduate secret societies have existed at the College of Arts & Science. Starting in 1832, the Philomathean Society and the Eucleian Society were formed, making rivals of each other. When the Philomathean Society died out, its remnants formed the Andiron Club in 1904. The most selective and famous club on campus is the Red Dragon Society, founded in 1898, which continues to exist to this day. Many notable NYU alumni have been members of these secret societies, including Elmer Ellsworth Brown, Howard Cann, John Harvey Kellogg, Walter Reed, and Frederic Tuten. Edgar Allan Poe was an occasional guest at the Eucleian Society. Notable alumniAcademics= Howard Zinn, Class of 1967 Martha Nussbaum, Class of 1969 * Edward J.

Early years Escudero was born and raised in San Juan, Puerto Rico the capital city of the island. His parents were well aware that their son was musically inclined at a young age. They also stressed that their son receive a good education and sent him to study in private schools. They wanted their son to learn about classical music and contracted the services of violin teacher Eduardo Geigel to teach Escudero how to play the violin. When Escudero wasn't in school or taking violin classes, he would spend hours on the family piano until he finally taught himself how to play. He perfected his piano playing by taking piano lessons from the maestro Pedro Escabi. Early influences During the 1960s, he enrolled in the University of Puerto Rico where he studied humanities. As a student in the university, he was exposed to the works of some of Puerto Rico's greatest poets, Antonio Machado, Julia de Burgos and Juan Antonio Corretjer. The works of these poets greatly influenced Escudero and where to serve as the basis for his inspiration. Modern Danzas Escudero debuted as a musician by recording modernized versions of classical danzas. He recorded \\"Añoranzas\\", \\"Carta a Juan Morel\\" and \\"Caricias\\". The recordings were a success and Escudero received the acceptance and recognition from the public and fellow musicians alike. During the 1970s, Escudero composed many songs that were recorded by the following singers, Danny Rivera, Marco Antonio Muñiz, Jose Feliciano, Cheo Feliciano, Ismael Miranda and many others. Escudero recorded 'Sin tu Amor\\" (Without your Love), \\"Cuando el amor germina\\", \\"Repica ese guiro y canta\\" and \\"Pa' cortase las venas\\". He also participated with dozens of Latin American singers in the recording of \\"Somos el Projimo\\" (We're your neighbor) which was the Latin-American version of \\"We Are The World\\". Escudero, appeared in the film \\"Under Suspicion\\" starring Morgan Freeman and Gene Hackman as a Ballroom musician and performed on the song \\"Party Man\\" written by Miguel Zayas.Under Suspicion Selection of Danza's by Escudero The following is a list of some of Escudero's Danza's: *Añoranza *Caricias *Carta a Morel Poet Escudero wrote two books of poetry. The first book was titled \\"En un Mundo de Cuerdos\\" and the second book \\"Comentario desde el Soberao\\", published by the Puerto Rican Institute of Culture. In 1999, he recorded \\"Comentario desde el Soberao\\" where he describes the situations and characters in his book. This was the first time that a poet/musician combined his poems and music together. Awards and recognitions Among the many awards and recognitions bestowed upon Escudero are the following, The Agüeybaná de Oro for composer of the year 1981 and the Outstanding Singer Award in the Record Festivals from 1983 to 1985. Escudero was also exalted into the Puerto Rico Music Hall of Fame on May 12, 2018.Senor Boricua Political activist In 1998, Escudero was named by Puerto Rico's governor Pedro Rosselló to join the board of directors of the Puerto Rican Institute of Culture and of the Luis A. Ferre Center for the Performing Arts (Centro de Bellas Arts). In 2001, he ran for the position of president of the New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico, however he withdrew from the race. Escudero currently remains politically active in the party.

Safety engineering professionals must have education, training and experience in a common body of knowledge. They need to have a fundamental knowledge of physics, chemistry, biology, physiology, statistics, mathematics, computer science, engineering mechanics, industrial processes, business, communication and psychology. Professional safety studies include industrial hygiene and toxicology, design of engineering hazard controls, fire protection, ergonomics, system and process safety, system safety, safety and health program management, accident investigation and analysis, product safety, construction safety, education and training methods, measurement of safety performance, human behavior, environmental safety and health, and safety, health and environmental laws, regulations and standards. Many safety engineers have backgrounds or advanced study in other disciplines, such as management and business administration, engineering, system engineering / industrial engineering, requirements engineering, reliability engineering, maintenance, human factors, operations, education, physical and social sciences and other fields. Others have advanced study in safety. This extends their expertise beyond the basics of the safety engineering profession. Functions of a Safety Engineer The major areas relating to the protection of people, property and the environment are: Personality and role Oddly enough, personality issues can be paramount in a safety engineer. They must be personally pleasant, intelligent, and ruthless with themselves and their organization. In particular, they have to be able to \\"sell\\" the failures that they discover, as well as the attendant expense and time needed to correct them. They can be the messengers of bad news. Safety engineers have to be ruthless about getting facts from other engineers. It is common for a safety engineer to consider software, chemical, electrical, mechanical, procedural, and training problems in the same day. Often the facts can be very uncomfortable as many safety related issues point towards mediocre management systems or worse, questionable business ethics. Teamwork It's difficult and expensive to retrofit safety into an unsafe system. To prevent safety problems, an organization should therefore treat safety as an early design and \\"architecture\\" activity, using the principles of Inherent safety, rather than as a \\"paperwork requirement\\" to be cleaned up after the real design is done. Safety engineers also must work in a team that includes other engineering specialties, quality assurance, quality improvement, regulatory compliance specialists, educators and lawyers. Subpar safety and quality problems often indicate underlying deficiencies in an organization's goals, recruitment, succession, training, management systems and business culture. Safety often works well in a true matrix-management organization, in which safety is a managed discipline integrated into a project plan.

HistoryOrigins of the clan=Traditional origins The surname Bannerman has its origin in the privilege of the family's ancestors having been the carriers of the royal standard (banner bearers) in the 10th and 11th centuries. The chief's arms also show this honorable office. It is not known exactly when this right passed to the family but according to one tradition it was during the reign of either Malcolm III of Scotland or Alexander I of Scotland. The king is said to have braved the raging waters of the River Spey and Sir Alexander Carron, the king's chamberlain carried the royal standard and the rest of the Scottish army followed. The rebels were defeated and Carron was rewarded by being named the hereditary Standard Bearer to the King. His descendants still bear this privilege. Recorded origins In June 1367 Donald Bannerman was granted the lands of Clyntrees, Waterton and Weltown in the parish of Ellon, Aberdeenshire from David II of Scotland. The Bannermans were required to build a chapel for weekly mass said for the repose of the soul of David II's father, King Robert the Bruce. The Abbot of Kinloss granted to the Bannermans land lying to the west of the city of Aberdeen in 1370. =16th and 17th centuries= The Bannermans became involved in the politics of north-east Scotland which included taking sides in the great feud between the powerful Clan Gordon and their enemies the Clan Forbes during the 16th century. The Bannermans generally supported the Forbeses. However, in 1608 Margaret Bannerman married George Gordon of Haddo, son of Sir John Gordon. George Gordon was a loyal supporter of the king and was later executed for opposing the National Covenant. Alexander Bannerman was also a supporter of Charles I of England against the Scottish presbyterians and his estates were only saved from being forfeited by passing them to his brother-in-law, Sir George Hamilton of Tulliallan. In 1644 Alexander Bannerman fought a duel with his cousin, Sir George Gordon of Haddo in which Gordon was wounded. The family lands were eventually restored to Alexander Bannerman's son, Alexander Bannerman of Elsick. This Alexander Bannerman was created a Baronet of Nova Scotia by Charles II of England on 28 December 1682 for his constant loyalty during the civil war. =18th century and Jacobite risings= Alexander Bannerman's youngest son, Sir Patrick, supported the deposed Stuart monarchs during the Jacobite rising of 1715. Sir Patrick was Provost of Aberdeen and presented a loyal address from the town to James Francis Edward Stuart (the Old Pretender) welcoming him to his ancient kingdom of Scotland. James promptly knighted Sir Patrick. Sir Patrick was arrested after the rising had failed and taken as a prisoner to Carlisle to await execution, but he managed to escape to France. During the Jacobite rising of 1745, Sir Alexander Bannerman, son of the second Baronet, with 160 men of the clan joined Prince Charles Edward Stuart at Stirling in 1745 and was also with the Prince when he escaped the disaster at the Battle of Culloden in 1746. Bannerman fled north to Dingwall and then to Sutherland. He later escaped to France having narrowly escaped government troops by hiding in a secret closet at Elsick. Sir Alexander Bannerman, the fourth Baronet was forced to sell the estates at Elsick due to the threat of forfeiture and suspected Jacobite intrigues. =Modern history= Henry Campbell-Bannerman was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1905 to 1908. He had assumed the name of Bannerman through his mother in 1868. His first government office was as financial secretary to the War Office. He rapidly rose through the ranks and became Secretary of State for War in 1886. He became a close friend of Edward VII who later made him Prime Minister. Sir Athur Bannerman, the twelfth Baronet served in the Indian Army and from 1921 to 1928 was a political aide to the Secretary of State for India. He was also appointed as a Gentleman Usher to George V, Edward VIII and also George VI. He was also made a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1928. John Bannerman, Baron Bannerman of Kildonan was one of Scotland's greatest rugby players, winning 39 caps for his country.

Golfer Sparks was born in Wheeling, West Virginia. From 1992 to 1994, she played golf at Duke University, where she was an All-America. A wrist injury threatened her career early, though, and she was forced to quit the team before graduating in 1996. As an amateur, Sparks won the 1993 Women's Western Amateur, a Women's Eastern Amateur, a West Virginia State Amateur, and the 1992 North and South Women's Amateur at Pinehurst. In 1996, after graduation, Sparks joined the Futures Tour, the LPGA's developmental tour. In 1999, Sparks finally got her LPGA card in a playoff at Q-School. So emotional was the moment for Sparks that she fell to the ground in tears numerous times while walking back to the clubhouse. 2000 was Sparks' only season as an LPGA player (she became a professional as a Futures Tour player), as back surgery at season's end forced her to retire. She made one cut at the Electrolux USA Championship in Nashville, Tennessee, earning $997. Television Sparks' time at The Golf Channel began as a production assistant in the cable television network's original productions department. In fact, the very first time Sparks appeared in front of a camera was in the 2004 film, Bobby Jones: A Stroke of Genius. In the movie, Sparks played Alexa Stirling, the winner of three consecutive United States Women's Amateur Golf Championships and a close friend of the legendary golfer. To try out for the part, Sparks went to an open audition during a lunch break in Orlando, where The Golf Channel's studios are located. To her surprise, she got the part, even without prior acting experience. She had just two scenes in the movie, and shooting them took just two days in the Autumn of 2003. Though Jones and Stirling were considered great golfers in their day, the big contrast between Sparks and the film's star, Jim Caviezel, who played Bobby Jones, was that Sparks was once a great player with much promise, though it was never completely fulfilled, and Caviezel had never picked up a golf club in his life. Sparks has said, though, that she has no desire to pursue an acting career, that it was just a great experience. She also said that working with Caviezel was \\"surreal.\\" The film debuted in April 2004, and Sparks' first time in front of a camera for The Golf Channel took place in July 2004, when she began hosting Golf With Style! Sparks also anchors short Golf Central updates on Thursdays and Fridays to tell viewers what's going on in the early part of a round at a golf tournament. Sparks also co-hosted the third edition of The Golf Channel's reality television competition show, The Big Break, titled, The Big Break III: Ladies Only, alongside Vince Cellini. It was the first time hosting the show for Sparks and Cellini. In the Fall of 2005, Sparks and Cellini returned to host The Big Break IV: USA vs. Europe. They will return again on February 7, 2006, for The Big Break V: Hawaii, a second \\"ladies only\\" edition.

This disease is mainly associated with the consumption of Lathyrus sativus (also known as grass pea, chickling pea, kesari dal, or almorta) and to a lesser degree with Lathyrus cicera, Lathyrus ochrus and Lathyrus clymenum\\"Medical problems caused by plants: Lathyrism\\" at Prince Leopold Institute of Tropical Medicine online database containing the toxin ODAP. This is not to be confused with osteolathyrism, a different type of lathyrism that affects the connective tissues. Osteolathyrism results from the ingestion of Lathyrus odoratus seeds (sweet peas) and is often referred to as odoratism. It is caused by a different toxin (beta-aminopropionitrile) which affects the linking of collagen, a protein of connective tissues. Another type of lathyrism is angiolathyrism which is similar to osteolathyrism in its effects on connective tissue. However, the blood vessels are affected as opposed to bone. Signs and symptoms The consumption of large quantities of Lathyrus grain containing high concentrations of the glutamate analogue neurotoxin β-oxalyl-L-α,β-diaminopropionic acid (ODAP, also known as β-N- oxalyl-amino-L-alanine, or BOAA) causes paralysis, characterized by lack of strength in or inability to move the lower limbs, and may involve pyramidal tracts producing signs of upper motor neuron damage. The toxin may also cause aortic aneurysm. A unique symptom of lathyrism is the atrophy of gluteal muscles (buttocks). ODAP is a poison of mitochondria, leading to excess cell death, especially in motor neurons. Children can additionally develop bone deformity and reduced brain development. Causes Glutamic acid Oxalyldiaminopropionic acid The toxicological cause of the disease has been attributed to the neurotoxin ODAP which acts as a structural analogue of the neurotransmitter glutamate. Lathyrism can also be caused by food adulteration. =Association with famine= Ingestion of legumes containing the toxin occurs, although knowledge of how to detoxify Lathyrus is present, but drought conditions can lead to fuel and water shortages preventing the necessary steps from being taken, particularly in impoverished countries. Lathyrism usually occurs where the despair of poverty and malnutrition leaves few other food options. Prevention Recent research suggests that sulfur amino acids have a protective effect against the toxicity of ODAP. Eating the chickling pea with grain having high concentrations of sulphur-based amino acids reduces the risk of lathyrism if grain is available. Food preparation is also an important factor. Toxic amino acids are readily soluble in water and can be leached. Bacterial (lactic acid) and fungal (tempeh) fermentation is useful to reduce ODAP content. Moist heat (boiling, steaming) denatures protease inhibitors which otherwise add to the toxic effect of raw chickling pea through depletion of protective sulfur amino acids. During drought and famine, water for steeping and fuel for boiling are often also in short supply. Poor people sometimes know how to reduce the chance of developing lathyrism but face a choice between risking lathyrism and starvation. Epidemiology This disease is prevalent in some areas of Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India and Nepal, and affects more men than women. Men between 25 and 40 are particularly vulnerable.Lathyrism History The first mentioned intoxication goes back to ancient India and also Hippocrates mentions a neurological disorder 46 B.C. in Greece caused by Lathyrus seed. Lathyrism was occurring on a regular basis. During the Spanish War of Independence against Napoleon, grasspea served as a famine food. This was the subject of one of Francisco de Goya's famous aquatint prints titled Gracias a la Almorta (\\"Thanks to the Grasspea\\"), depicting poor people surviving on a porridge made from grasspea flour, one of them lying on the floor, already crippled by it. During WWII, on the order of Colonel I. Murgescu, commandant of the Vapniarka concentration camp in Transnistria, the detainees - most of them Jews - were fed nearly exclusively with fodder pea. Consequently, they became ill from lathyrism.isurvived.org: The Holocaust in Romania Under the Antonescu Government, by Marcu Rozen. In the film Ashes [English title] by Andrzej Wajda based on the novel Popioly [Polish title] translated as Lost army [English title] by Stefan Żeromski spanning the period 1798–1812, a horse is poisoned by grain from a Spanish village. The footage of the horse losing control of its hind legs suggests that it was fed with Almortas. Modern occurrence During the post Civil war period in Spain, there were several outbreaks of lathyrism, caused by the shortage of food, which led people to consume excessive amounts of almorta flour. In Spain, a seed mixture known as comuñaThe etymological origin of this name is from \\"común\\" (common) in its meaning of mixture, referring to the mix of seeds obtained when cleaning the grain and which contaminate the main grain, generally wheat. consisting of Lathyrus sativus, L. cicera, Vicia sativa and V. ervilia provides a potent mixture of toxic amino acids to poison monogastric (single stomached) animals. Particularly the toxin β-cyanoalanine from seeds of V. sativa enhances the toxicity of such a mixture through its inhibition of sulfur amino acid metabolism [conversion of methionine to cysteine leading to excretion of cystathionine in urine] and hence depletion of protective reduced thiols. Its use for sheep does not pose any lathyrism problems if doses do not exceed 50 percent of the ration. Ronald Hamilton suggested in his paper The Silent Fire: ODAP and the death of Christopher McCandless that itinerant traveler Christopher McCandless may have died from starvation after being unable to hunt or gather food due to lathyrism induced paralysis of his legs caused by eating the seeds of Hedysarum alpinum. In 2014, a preliminary lab analysis indicated that the seeds did contain ODAP.newyorker.com However, a more detailed mass spectrometric analysis conclusively ruled out ODAP, with a molecular weight of 176.13 and lathyrism, and instead found that the most significant contributor to his death was the toxic action of L-canavanine, with a molecular weight of 176.00, which was found in significant quantity in the Hedysarum Alpinum Seeds he was eating.newyorker.com Related conditions A related disease has been identified and named osteolathyrism, because it affects the bones and connecting tissues, instead of the nervous system. It is a skeletal disorder, caused by the toxin beta-aminopropionitrile (BAPN), and characterized by hernias, aortic dissection, exostoses, and kyphoscoliosis and other skeletal deformities, apparently as the result of defective aging of collagen tissue. The cause of this disease is attributed to beta-aminopropionitrile, which inhibits the copper-containing enzyme lysyl oxidase, responsible for cross- linking procollagen and proelastin. BAPN is also a metabolic product of a compound present in sprouts of grasspea, pea and lentils.COHN, D.F.

It splits Bay Bridge traffic into three freeways—the Eastshore (I-80/I-580), MacArthur (I-580) and Nimitz (I-880).  Description  San Francisco Bay Area traffic funnels across the few bridges spanning the bay, so the Maze's central location near the east end of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge makes it a hub for east–west and north–south traffic accessing San Francisco and Oakland. It is also next to the Port of Oakland, the fourth busiest container port in the United States.Port of Oakland Website The four freeways intersecting at this interchange are: * *: Interstate 80 from the Maze heads west across the Bay Bridge into San Francisco, where it joins US 101. * *:The Interstate 80/Interstate 580 wrong-way concurrency from the Maze heads north through Berkeley and western Contra Costa County. Just north of the Berkeley-Albany border, approximately north of the Maze, the concurrency splits. Interstate 80 heads northeast towards Sacramento. Interstate 580 heads northwest towards the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge and eventually to Marin County, where it joins U.S. 101 in San Rafael. * *: Interstate 580 from the Maze heads southeast through Oakland. A mile southeast is an interchange with State Route 24/Interstate 980, a corridor for commuters from Contra Costa County. I-580 continues southeast along the foot of the hills (and nearly atop the trace of the Hayward Fault) to Castro Valley. I-580 then turns east and continues through the Livermore Valley, over Altamont Pass, and ending up near Tracy where it terminates at Interstate 5. * *: Interstate 880 from the Maze heads south and southeast through Oakland along the Oakland Estuary, past the Oakland International Airport, and the Oakland Coliseum, then through southern Alameda County to San Jose where it turns into Highway 17 to Santa Cruz. Local traffic using the interchange includes East Bay commuters to and from San Francisco via the Bay Bridge, as well as drivers traveling up and down the East Bay. For long distance traffic accessing other parts of the country, I-80 is the primary Interstate Highway for points east. Although Interstate 5, the main north–south Interstate Highway on the West Coast of the United States, bypasses the Bay Area to the east, connections are provided to the Maze via I-505 and I-80 from the north, and I-580 to the south. Furthermore, drivers on US 101 who want to bypass San Francisco can use I-880 from San Jose to the Maze, and then I-580 across the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge. Despite the interchange's size, it does not permit complete freedom of movement. Drivers approaching the Maze on I-880 from the south cannot directly access I-580 east, nor can drivers on I-580 from the east directly access I-880 south. = CA 24/I-980/I-580 = The MacArthur Maze is sometimes considered to include or instead refer to the four-level stack interchange completed in 1985 between California State Route 24, Interstate 980, and Interstate 580, approximately east of the East Bay Distribution Structure, which allows full freedom of movement, unlike the MacArthur Maze, and is often used (in conjunction with I-980's southern terminus at I-880) for the Maze's missing movements. The Distribution Structure properly refers to the interchange between I-80, 580, and 880 described here, which was completed in 1936 as part of the eastern approach to the Bay Bridge.  History  Original 1936 configuration The maze was constructed along with the Bay Bridge in the 1930s; construction of the Distribution Structure itself started on April 8, 1934.California Highways and Public Works, Official Journal of the Division of Highways, Department of Public Works, State of California, March 1935, p.16 Although the official name was the East Bay Distribution Structure, the media and public nicknamed it the \\"Maze\\" as early as 1939.San Francisco Chronicle, 1939 The site, wholly contained within the city of Oakland, was chosen as it was a key point where tracks from the Southern Pacific, Santa Fe, and Key System railroads intersected. The first configuration was relatively simple: westbound traffic from 38th St (later MacArthur Blvd) merged with northbound traffic from Cypress St and crossed above the Southern Pacific tracks, then split into ramps north to the Eastshore Highway (US 40) and west to the Bay Bridge. A parallel set of ramps handled eastward/southward traffic. Film footage of the early Maze can be seen in the 1941 movie Shadow of the Thin Man, as Nick and Nora Charles drive off the Bay Bridge on their way to Golden Gate Fields in Albany. In the original 1936 configuration, traffic flows had to weave for approximately ; a third level was completed on October 24, 1955, separating traffic between MacArthur and the Bay Bridge from the north–south traffic between Cypress and the Eastshore Highway. The enlargement to the Maze was consonant with plans already underway to build the double-deck Cypress Viaduct (which was later incorporated into the Nimitz Freeway, I-880). In addition, MacArthur Blvd was planned to be expanded into a freeway (the MacArthur Freeway, I-580). The nickname \\"MacArthur\\" Maze originated sometime after the completion of the MacArthur Freeway in the early 1960s. View of the Maze from the Berkeley Hills Another round of extensive re-engineering followed the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, including the addition of diamond lane ramps and a huge girder flyover connecting the relocated northbound Nimitz with the northbound Eastshore Freeway (which is technically I-80 eastbound and I-580 westbound). The original 1936 ramps were removed during this 1990s construction. Reinforcements were completed in 2001-2002. = 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake = Portion of the collapsed Cypress Viaduct over 32nd Street in Oakland following the Loma Prieta earthquake During the 6.9 Loma Prieta earthquake, the double-decked Cypress Street Viaduct on I-880 between I-80 and the 14th Street exit collapsed, crushing cars and killing 42 people. Traffic on the MacArthur Maze headed towards I-880 was re-routed to I-580 and I-980, and ramps at both ends of the viaduct leading to the former Cypress Structure were temporarily signed for local traffic access to Cypress Street. The Cypress Street Viaduct was demolished soon after the earthquake, but a replacement freeway wasn't opened until July 1997, due to lawsuits by environmentalists and local residents. A second connection to the Maze, known as the East Bay Viaduct, opened in 1998 but due to safety concerns, as well as ongoing retrofitting on the eastern I-580 connector, the structure was not fully rebuilt until 2001 (though a connection northwest to the Bay Bridge along the alignment of the old Grand Avenue Viaduct was built in 1995). The replacement sections of the Nimitz Freeway dispensed with the double-deck design. It was built near the Union Pacific railway tracks around the outskirts of West Oakland, rather than bisecting that neighborhood as the Cypress Viaduct had. Cypress Street, which ran on each side of the old double- deck highway, is now a landscaped parkway and has been renamed Mandela Parkway. In 2007 Mandela Parkway was linked at its north end with the west end of Yerba Buena Avenue, creating a new through route into Emeryville. = 2007 I-580 East Connector collapse = A portion of Interstate 580 following the collapse. At 3:42 am on Sunday, April 29, 2007, a tank truck carrying 8,600 gallons (32,500 liters) of unleaded gasoline overturned on the connector from Interstate 80 west (from Berkeley) to Interstate 880 south.AA Roads. Photo of I-880 southbound connector under the I-80E to I-580E ramp Interstate-Guide.com (November 26, 2004, retrieved on May 6, 2007) The intense heat from the subsequent fuel spill and fire weakened the steel structure of the roadway above, which served as the connecting ramp from Interstate 80 east (from San Francisco) to Interstate 580 east (to Oakland), collapsing approximately 168 feet (50 m)Caltrans , retrieved on May 8, 2007 of it onto the lower connector. The truck driver involved suffered second degree burns on his hands but was nonetheless able to walk 1.5 miles (2.4 km) to a gas station, where he found a taxi and was given a ride to Oakland Kaiser Medical Center. No other vehicles or persons were reported to be involved in the accident. The California Highway Patrol (CHP) initially reported that they suspected that the tanker had been speeding and bounced off a guard rail, leading to the overturn. The driver was found to have a clean record the preceding decade; drug or alcohol use was determined not to be a factor in the accident. The collapse of this bridge cut off the return route from San Francisco for many East Bay commuters (primarily those whose destinations are Walnut Creek and southeastern Oakland). To help ease the expected traffic snarl, Caltrans set up temporary detours within the days following the incident, Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) added additional capacity to lines serving areas that had been impacted by the incident, and on Monday April 30, all public transportation in the Bay Area was free, with the estimated cost of $2.5 million paid out of state funds. News commentators have pointed out the similarities to the disruption caused by the Loma Prieta earthquake 18 years earlier. While there was some serious congestion on the detour routes, the expected traffic jams and long delays did not fully materialize. This was possibly due to commuters switching to alternate transit options, indicated by BART posting record ridership numbers during that time.  Rebuilding  Caltrans spokespersons estimated immediately after the accident that it would take weeks to clear the debris from the scene and months to rebuild the affected sections. Initial cost projections for rebuilding the I-580 connector alone reached $10 million. However, due to the urgency to reopen such a vital highway link the project was expedited, and most demolition work and debris removal was completed by the Tuesday following the accident. For a historic comparison, Caltrans did successfully replace a single damaged upper deck panel of the Bay Bridge (after the Loma Prieta earthquake) and the collapsed portion of the I-10 Santa Monica Freeway in Los Angeles (after the Northridge earthquake) in roughly one month by expediting its internal approval process and offering an incentive program for the contractors. On May 7, 2007, the I-880 connector reopened at 4:30 am to traffic. Substantial work was done to retrofit the strength of the structure, which had sunk due to the collapse of the I-580 connector onto the I-880 connector. The connector during reconstruction work. A contractor with a proven track record of rebuilding damaged freeways (most notably the Santa Monica Freeway after the 1994 Northridge earthquake) well ahead of schedule, C. C. Myers, Inc., submitted a winning bid of $876,075 to repair the damage to the I-580 connector. The bid was estimated to cover only one-third of the cost of the work, but the firm counted on making up the shortfall with an incentive of $200,000 per day if the work was completed before June 27, 2007. On the evening of Thursday, May 24, the I-580 connector re-opened, just before the busy Memorial Day weekend. The deadline to finish the project was beaten by over a month, with the contractor earning the $5 million bonus for early completion. The entire reconstruction project was completed only 26 days after the original accident. A state projection concluded that the connector collapse had cost $90 million, based on a $6 million per day economic impact estimate. This includes a $491,000 loss in toll revenue for the Oakland Bay Bridge.Connector Collapse Reduces Income from Bridge Tolls On May 25, 2007, the CHP revoked the license for transporting hazardous materials from Sabek Transportation, the owner of the tank truck, after an investigation found 36 violations of its operations and equipment.

The film was produced and directed by James William Guercio, and is named after the Harley-Davidson Electra Glide motorcycle issued to traffic cops. The soundtrack was performed by members of the band Chicago; Guercio managed them at the time, and produced many of their albums. Members of the band also appear in minor acting roles in the film. Plot John Wintergreen is a motorcycle cop who patrols the rural Arizona highways with his partner Zipper. Wintergreen is an experienced patrolman looking to be transferred to the Homicide unit. When he is informed by Crazy Willie of an apparent suicide-by- shotgun, Wintergreen believes the case is actually a murder as the victim has shot himself in the chest rather than the head, which is more usual. Detective Harve Poole agrees it is a homicide, after a .22 bullet is found amongst the pellets in the man's chest during the autopsy, as well as hearing about a possible missing $5,000 ($ today) from the man's home, and arranges for Wintergreen to be transferred to homicide to help with the case. Wintergreen gets his wish, but his joy is short-lived. He begins increasingly to identify with the hippies whom the other officers, including Detective Poole, are endlessly harassing. The final straw comes when Poole discovers that Wintergreen has been sleeping with his girlfriend, Jolene. The hostile workplace politics cause him to be quickly demoted back to traffic enforcement. Despite being demoted, Wintergreen is able to solve the murder. The killer turns out to be Willie, who confesses while Wintergreen goads him into talking about it. Wintergreen surmises that Willie did it because he was jealous of the old man he killed, who frequently had young people over to his house to buy drugs. Shortly after, it is discovered that Zipper stole the $5,000, which he used to buy a fully dressed Electra Glide motorcycle. Wintergreen is forced to shoot Zipper after he becomes distressed and belligerent, and shoots at Wintergreen and in the direction of an innocent bystander while brandishing a gun. Wintergreen, now alone and back on his old beat, runs into a hippie that Zipper was needlessly harassing earlier on a previous stop. Recognizing him, Wintergreen lets him off with a warning, but the hippie forgets his driver's license, and Wintergreen drives up behind his van to return it to him. The hippie's passenger points a shotgun out of the back window and shoots Wintergreen, killing him.

During their discussions, it transpired that Guercio and Hall disagreed on how the film should look; a compromise was reached where Guercio would shoot the exterior scenes in a manner reminiscent of John Ford's films (which was the look Guercio wanted to achieve), while Hall could set up and shoot all the film's interior scenes any way he saw fit. According to the DVD commentary, Guercio claims that a majority of the film was shot without permits, because the Arizona Highway Patrol would not cooperate with production. The movie was filmed in Monument Valley and Fountain Hills, Arizona. Production was several days behind schedule due to Guercio's inexperience as a director. In Blake's 2012 autobiography Tales From a Rascal, he refers to this film as being a very tough shoot and that he essentially co-directed the picture with Hall while Guercio \\"stood around\\". Guercio was best known as the producer of the rock band Chicago. Members of the band appear in the film in minor roles, including Peter Cetera, Terry Kath, Lee Loughnane and Walter Parazaider, as well as Hawk Wolinski from the Guercio-produced band Madura. Chicago members also perform on the movie soundtrack. The soundtrack album also included a four-page fold- out poster of Robert Blake standing beside his cycle on a bluff overlooking Monument Valley. Though Blake complained about production woes and lamented at his $20,000 fee, his starring role would catch the attention of television executives and lead to the police drama series Baretta, for which Blake is most known. The film has gone on to develop a cult following since the 1990s. ReleaseHome media= Electra Glide in Blue was released on DVD by MGM on March 22, 2005. A Blu-ray was released on June 4, 2013 by Shout! Factory. Reception The film received a review in The New York Times, which described it as \\"portentous\\" but portraying \\"very ordinary or very embarrassing things: a crudely staged bike chase, or the confessions of a demoralized bar girl in what looks and sounds like a second-year acting exercise in drama school.\\" The film was entered into the 1973 Cannes Film Festival. Robert Blake was nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance. In 2012, Time magazine called Electra Glide in Blue \\"A neglected cult-classic that could have only come from (or have been made in) the early ‘70s\\" and said: \\"It’s a quirky but unforgettable movie — part character study, part examination of an emerging youth culture — featuring some outstanding camerawork from future Oscar-winning cinematographer Conrad Hall.\\" The film has a 67% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

Charles Darwin's theory of inheritance by pangenesis, with contributions to egg or sperm from every part of the body, implied blending inheritance. His reliance on this mechanism led Fleeming Jenkin to attack Darwin's theory of natural selection on the grounds that blending inheritance would average out any novel beneficial characteristic before selection had time to act. Blending inheritance was discarded with the general acceptance of particulate Mendelian inheritance during the development of modern genetics after 1900.

The theory implied that changes to the body during an organism's life would be inherited, as proposed in Lamarckism, and that inheritance would be blending. =Darwin's pangenesis= Charles Darwin developed his theory of evolution by natural selection on the basis of an understanding of uniform processes in geology, acting over very long periods of time on inheritable variation within populations. One of those processes was competition for resources, as Thomas Malthus had indicated, leading to a struggle to survive and to reproduce. Since some individuals would by chance have traits that allowed them to leave more offspring, those traits would tend to increase in the population. Darwin assembled many lines of evidence to show that variation occurred and that artificial selection by animal and plant breeding had caused change. All of this demanded a reliable mechanism of inheritance. Pangenesis was Darwin's attempt to provide such a mechanism of inheritance. The idea was that each part of the parent's body emitted tiny particles called gemmules, which migrated through the body to contribute to that parent's gametes, their eggs or sperms. The theory had an intuitive appeal, as characteristics of all parts of the body, such as shape of nose, width of shoulders and length of legs are inherited from both the father and the mother. However, it had some serious weaknesses. Firstly, many characteristics can change during an individual's lifetime, and are affected by the environment: blacksmiths can develop strong arm muscles during their work, so the gemmules from these muscles ought to carry this acquired characteristic. That implies the Lamarckian inheritance of acquired characteristics. Secondly, the fact that the gemmules were supposed to mix together on fertilisation implies blending inheritance, namely that the offspring would all be intermediate between the father and the mother in every characteristic. That directly contradicts the observed facts of inheritance, not least that children are usually either male or female rather than all intersex, and that traits such as flower colour often re-emerge after a generation, even when they seem to disappear when two varieties are crossed. Darwin was aware of both these objections, and accordingly had strong doubts about blending inheritance, as evidenced in his private correspondence. In a letter to T.H. Huxley, dated November 12, 1857, Darwin wrote: Blending inheritance leads to the averaging out of every characteristic, which as the engineer Fleeming Jenkin pointed out, would make natural selection impossible if blending were the mechanism of inheritance. In a letter to Alfred Wallace, dated February 6, 1866, Darwin mentioned conducting hybridization experiments with pea plants, not unlike those done by Gregor Mendel, and like him obtaining segregating (unblended) varieties, effectively disproving his theory of pangenesis with blending: Blending inheritance was also clearly incompatible with Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. The engineer Fleeming Jenkin used this to attack natural selection in his 1867 review of Darwin's On the Origin of Species. Jenkin noted, correctly, that if inheritance were by blending, any beneficial trait that might arise in a lineage would have \\"blended away\\" long before natural selection had time to act. The evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins commented that blending inheritance was observably wrong, as it implied that every generation would be more uniform than the one before, and that Darwin should have said as much to Jenkin. The problem was not with natural selection, but with blending, and in Dawkins's view, Darwin should have settled for saying that the mechanism of inheritance was unknown, but certainly non-blending. =Replacement by Mendelian inheritance= A Punnett square for one of Mendel's pea plant experiments - self-fertilization of the F1 generation, shows that inheritance is particulate, not blending. Blending inheritance was dismissed by the eventual widespread acceptance, after his death, of Gregor Mendel's theory of particulate inheritance, which he had presented in Experiments on Plant Hybridization (1865). In 1892, August Weismann set out the idea of a hereditary material, which he called the germ plasm, confined to the gonads and independent of the rest of the body (the soma). In Weismann's view, the germ plasm formed the body, but the body did not influence the germ plasm, except indirectly by natural selection. This contradicted both Darwin's pangenesis and Lamarckian inheritance. Mendel's work was rediscovered in 1900 by the geneticist Hugo de Vries and others, soon confirmed that same year by experiments by William Bateson. Mendelian inheritance with segregating, particulate alleles came to be understood as the explanation for both discrete and continuously varying characteristics.

It was preceded by the 1990 film The Hunt for Red October and the 1992 film Patriot Games, all three featuring Clancy's character Jack Ryan. It is the last film version of Clancy's novels to feature Harrison Ford as Ryan and James Earl Jones as Vice Admiral James Greer, as well as the final installment directed by Noyce. As in the novel, Ryan is appointed CIA Acting Deputy Director (Intelligence) (DDI), and discovers he is being kept in the dark by colleagues who are conducting a covert war against a drug cartel in Colombia, apparently with the approval of the President. The film premiered in theaters in the United States on August 3, 1994, and was a major financial success, earning over $200 million at the box office. Plot The discovery of the murder of an American businessman, Peter Hardin, and his family, outrages U.S. President Bennett, Hardin's personal friend. When Hardin is found to have been connected to a Colombian drug cartel, from which he skimmed over $650 million, Bennett tells James Cutter, his National Security Advisor, that the cartels represent a \\"clear and present danger\\" to the United States, tacitly instructing him to use force against the men responsible for his friend's murder. Jack Ryan, appointed acting Deputy Director of Intelligence after Vice Admiral Jim Greer is stricken with cancer, asks Congress for increased funding for ongoing CIA operations in Colombia, believing the funds to be for advisory purposes only. Keeping Ryan in the dark, Cutter turns to CIA Deputy Director of Operations Bob Ritter to take down the cartel. Ritter assembles a black operations team code named RECIPROCITY with the help of John Clark. The team inserts itself into Colombia, with Clark running logistics and Captain Ricardo Ramirez of a SF-ODA team commanding the squad on the ground in clandestine search-and-destroy missions against the drug cartel. Meanwhile, Bennett sends Ryan to Colombia to investigate Hardin's cartel connection. The cartel leader responsible for Hardin's murder, Ernesto Escobedo, is enraged when the U.S. attempts to claim the $650 million that was stolen from him, and has his intelligence officer, Félix Cortez, try to retrieve the funds. Bennett sends FBI Director Emil Jacobs to meet Ryan in Colombia and negotiate for the money, and when Cortez discovers this, he plans an ambush, engineering it so that suspicion will fall on Escobedo. Ryan barely escapes the ambush by cartel hitmen, but the remainder of the entourage is killed. Escobedo then summons a meeting with other cartel leaders, which Clark's team hits with an airstrike, but Escobedo is late arriving and survives. Cortez discovers the American involvement in the strike, and meets with Cutter to broker a deal. Cortez will assassinate Escobedo and take over the cartel, promising to reduce drug shipments to the U.S. and allow American law enforcement to make regular arrests to make it appear as if the U.S. is winning the drug war. In exchange, Cutter will shut down all U.S. operations in Colombia and allow Cortez to hunt down Clark's soldiers. Cutter agrees and orders Ritter to get rid of all evidence of their operations and cut off the troops in Colombia from all support. Ryan is played a recording of the conversation between Cutter and Cortez. He hacks Ritter's computer and discovers the conspiracy unfolding in Colombia. The Reciprocity team is ambushed in Colombia by Cortez's mercenaries. Ryan arrives and convinces Clark to allow him to help. They find the team's sniper, Chavez, who tells them that Ramirez and a squadmate have been captured and the remainder have been killed. Ryan visits Escobedo's mansion and shares his intelligence on Cortez. Enraged, Escobedo confronts Cortez, but is killed by Cortez's associate. Ryan, Clark, and Chávez rescue the prisoners, kill Cortez, and escape. Ryan confronts the President and tells him he intends to inform the Congressional Oversight Committee about the conspiracy despite the damage it could do to his career. As he walks out of the Oval Office, Cutter asks to speak with him, but Ryan ignores him. Ryan then begins his testimony to Congress. CastProductionDevelopment= After completing The Hunt for Red October, John McTiernan had wanted to direct an adaptation of Clear and Present Danger, and departed from the production after an early script by John Milius was rejected in favor of Patriot Games. Milius's first draft was more faithful to the original book than the final film, and he later added the sequence where Jack Ryan is ambushed in SUVs. He said that the original ending had Cortez going to Washington to kill the National Security Advisor, only to be killed in a mugging by drug addicts.Segaloff, Nat, \\"John Milius: The Good Fights\\", Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s, Ed. Patrick McGilligan, Uni of California 2006 p 310 After Clancy's dissatisfaction with Patriot Games, he was reluctant to allow any further adaptations of his material, but acquiesced after negotiations with Paramount Pictures and a large financial deal. In March 1992, Donald E. Stewart was hired to rewrite Milius's script to provide greater screen time to Jack Ryan. After Clancy openly criticized the script, Steven Zaillian rewrote it further in an attempt to gain his approval. Milius was retained during production to provide consultation on the action scenes. = Production = The film was shot in Mexico after the studio decided that filming on-location in Colombia was too dangerous, with Mexico City standing in for Bogotá and the Hacienda San Gabriel de la Palmas in Cuernavaca serving as a set for Escobedo's headquarters. Ironically, the decision to produce the film in Mexico encountered further difficulties due to the outbreak of the Chiapas conflict. The film ran drastically behind schedule and over budget, and part of the footage shot in the United States was destroyed due to the 1994 Northridge earthquake. After negative results from test screenings, parts of the film were reshot using scenes written by Stewart and Zaillian. =Music= The film's musical score was composed by James Horner. Milan Records released an album featuring selections from the score on August 2, 1994. An expanded two- disc collector's edition was released in 2013 by specialty label Intrada Records. The new version now includes the complete score by Horner, remixed from the original scoring master tapes with cues appearing in the same order as they appear in the film. Some parts of the soundtrack are based on the music from James Horner's soundtrack for Gorky Park, but played with different instruments. ReceptionCritical response= The film received positive reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives it a rating of 80% based on reviews from 44 critics. The site's consensus states: \\"Perfecting the formula established in earlier installments, Clear and Present Danger reunites its predecessor's creative core to solidly entertaining effect.\\" At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average out of 100 to critics' reviews, Clear and Present Danger received a score of 74 based on 14 reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A\\" on an A+ to F scale. Mick LaSalle, writing for the San Francisco Chronicle, commented how it \\"delights in an almost boyish way in the trappings of power: rocket launchers and high- tech missiles, flags, ceremony and political double-speak.\\" James Berardinelli, who wrote for ReelViews, remarked, \\"Clear and Present Danger is all plot and no characters. The people running around on screen have about as much depth as the sheen of sweat on Harrison Ford's forehead. Jack Ryan is the most disappointing of all. He's disgustingly virtuous: a flawless fighter for good and justice, a Superman without the cape. I spent half the movie wondering if this guy was ever going to show anything to mark him as vaguely human.\\" In Reel Power: Hollywood Cinema and American Supremacy, author Matthew Alford formulated a critique of the film, pointing out that supporting characters like Cutter and Ritter are pointedly squeamish about the use of force. He queried, \\"Where is this abundance of sensitivity from the US national security apparatus towards the people of Latin America in the real world?\\". He concluded, \\"The answers are all too obvious, except to a Hollywood hooked on schmaltz, willfully ignorant of reality and in thrall to power.\\"Alford, Reel Power, p. 91 =Box office= Clear and Present Danger opened strongly at the U.S. box office, grossing $20,348,017 in its first weekend and holding the top spot for two weeks. It went on to gross an estimated $122 million in the U.S., and $94 million in foreign revenue for a worldwide total of $216 million. = Year-end lists = * 8th – Kenneth Turan, Los Angeles Times * Honorable mention – Glenn Lovell, San Jose Mercury News * Honorable mention – John Hurley, Staten Island Advance * Honorable mention – David Elliott, The San Diego Union-Tribune * Honorable mention – Michael Mills, The Palm Beach Post * Honorable mention – Dan Craft, The Pantagraph * Honorable mention – Bob Carlton, The Birmingham News =Accolades= The film was nominated for two Academy Awards for Best Sound (Donald O.

The church is in the Diocese of Saint David's within the Church in Wales, and a member of the Anglican Communion. It is the parish church for St Mary In Liberty (the borough and town) and St Mary Out Liberty (the rural area to the north). History and description The majority of the remaining building dates from the 15th century with some features retained from the 13th century.ST MARY'S CHURCH, TENBY;CHURCH OF ST MARY IN LIBERTY, Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales. Updated 13 November 2007. Retrieved 2012-02-26. There is believed to have been a church on the site since Norman times, and Gerald of Wales is counted as the earliest Rector of Tenby. The 13th Century chancel has a 'wagon' roof and the panelled ceiling has 75 bosses carved in a variety of designs including foliage, grotesques, fishes, a mermaid, and a green man, as well as the figure of Jesus surrounded by the four Apostles. St. Thomas' Chapel was added in the mid-15th Century, and the St. Nicholas Chapel was added c. 1485. The spire is also a 15th-century addition. Inside the church is a 15th-century font and a 15th-century bell, cast with the letters 'Sancta Anna'. The tower is positioned to one side of the chancel and dates from the late 13th century. The first floor served as a chapel, and still has a stone altar and piscina in place. The church has two fonts, one dating from the 15th century and another late Gothic example from the 19th century. The church contains several memorials, including the tombs of Thomas and John White, both Mayors of Tenby in the fifteenth century. Thomas White was famous for hiding a young Henry Tudor from King Richard III. There is also a wall tablet in memory of Robert Recorde, an Elizabethan scholar, who introduced the equals sign ( = ) to mathematical calculation. The church was Grade I listed in 1951 as being \\"an outstanding late medieval church with exceptional roofs and monuments\\". In the churchyard, 20 metres west of the church, are the remains of what is believed to be a late 15th-century choir school or college. The wall includes a pointed arched doorway. These remains are Grade II* listed. ReferencesExternal links *Official website *Artwork at St Mary's Church, Tenby *St. Mary's *The Tower of St. Mary's Church Tenby, Virtual Tenby.

Jacobsen, a professor of classical archaeology and classical studies at Indiana University, began excavations at Franchthi Cave in 1967. The dig was only intended to temporarily occupy Jacobsen and his fellow researcher, M.H. Jameson, for one short season, while they waited for land use issues to be resolved at a nearby site. But it soon became clear that Franchthi Cave was more important than they had anticipated.Colin Renfrew (1994) \\"Review of Excavations at Franchthi Cave, Greece by T. W. Jacobsen,\\" Journal of Field Archaeology 21(3): 378–379 The excavation, overseen by Jacobsen, would continue for nearly a decade, ending in 1976.

Farrand, (2003) p. 69 During the Upper Paleolithic Franchthi Cave was seasonally occupied by a small group (or groups), probably in the range of 25–30 people, who mainly hunted wild ass and red deer, carrying a stone tool kit of flint bladelets and scrapers.T.W.

Cullen (1995) p. 270 thumb Neolithic The cave also contains some of the earliest evidence for agriculture in Greece. Around 7,000 BC,C. Perles (2001) p.91 the remains of domesticated plants and animals are found among the usual wild plant and animal species hunted and gathered during the Mesolithic, suggesting that either the inhabitants of Franchthi had begun to practice agriculture or were trading for seeds and meat with the Neolithic people who had recently arrived from the Near East.C. Perles (2001) pp. 46–48 There has been some debate about whether agriculture developed locally in Greece, or was introduced by colonists. It is now generally believed that emigrants from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B cultures of the Near East arrived by boat at the beginning of the seventh millennium BC to settle Greece (c. 6900 BC), introducing agriculture.C. Perles (2001) pp. 45–46,52 For some time the evidence from Franchthi was used as an example in support of locally developed agriculture, but more detailed study of the remains has demonstrated that the evidence supports the foreign introduction of domesticated plants and animals.J.M. Hansen (1992) \\"Franchthi Cave and the Beginnings of Agriculture in Greece and the Aegean.\\" Prehistoire de l'agriculture. Nouvelles approches experimentales et ethnographiques, CNRS, Paris pp. 231–47 The Mesolithic hunter-gatherers of Greece rapidly adopted the methods introduced to them by Neolithic colonists, including at Franchthi Cave.C. Perles (2001) p. 56 During the Neolithic main occupancy of the cave shifted to an area outside the entrance, called the Paralia (the seaside),C. Perles (2001) pp. 48–49 where terracing walls for growing crops were built.C. Perles (2001) p. 292 It is believed the inhabitants also occupied a village below the Paralia, which is now submerged beneath the sea. Several anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figurines have been recovered at Franchthi from the Neolithic era,L.E. Talalay (1993) \\"Deities, Dolls, and Devices. Neolithic Figurines from Franchthi Cave, Greece\\" Excavations at Franchthi Cave, Greece, fasc. 9, Indiana University Press, Bloomington and Indianapolis and it has been suggested that the site may have served as a workshop for making cockle- shell beads to trade with inland communities during the Early Neolithic.C. Perles (2001) pp. 224–226 The cave and the Paralia were abandoned around 3,000 BC.  Underwater village  The Franchthi area of Kiladha Bay is considered a strong candidate for having a submerged Neolithic village, and in 2012 a search was launched for any underwater evidence of such a site. Called the Bay of Kiladha Project, it is a collaboration between the University of Geneva and the Greek Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities. Its first step was to conduct coring, sampling, and charting to create a detailed map of \\"the paleo- shorelines and submerged prehistoric landscapes of the late Pleistocene and Early Holocene...\\" for use in discovering traces of prehistoric human activity. This study of the seafloor involved two research vessels: the Alkyon from the Hellenic Center for Marine Research, and PlanetSolar, currently the world's largest solar-powered boat, which was commissioned by the University of Geneva for its Terra Submersa program.Apostolos Sarris, Evita Kalogiropoulou, Tuna Kalayci, Evagelica Karimali (2018) \\"Communities, Landscapes, and Interaction in Neolithic Greece\\" Berghahm Books pp. 261–263https://m.phys.org/news/2014-08-europe-oldest-village-sought-greek.html In 2014 the Terra Submersa team, led by Julien Beck, was waiting for permission to conduct their survey of the Franchthi area of Kiladha Bay. To bide their time they ran some training dives several hundred metres north, just outside the mouth of the Bay, at Lambayanna Beach. These dives revealed very old pottery fragments and odd seafloor anomalies that piqued their interest. Returning in 2015 for a more thorough investigation, they found the ruins of an Early Bronze Age city. The site spans and lies beneath of water. It includes the foundations of buildings, stone paved surfaces that are likely roads, and what appear to be the remains of a fortification wall with three large towers. Such a defensive structure would be the first of its kind to be discovered from the Early Bronze Age in Greece. The visible remains of Lambayanna are dated to the Early Helladic II era (c. 2650 – c. 2200 BC), making it a contemporary of the House of the Tiles at Lerna, the building of the Great Pyramids, and both the Cycladic and Minoan cultures of the nearby Aegean islands. A second layer of Lambayanna has been identified as Early Helladic I (c. 3200 – c. 2650 BC), and a third layer has revealed pottery that dates all the way back to an intermediary period between the Bronze Age and the Neolithic, suggesting not only that the site is well over 5,000 years old, but that it may have had an overlapping relationship with the Neolithic Franchthi community.Patricia Birchler Emery, Julien Beck (2016) \\"The EH II site at Lambayanna (Argolid): artifacts and assemblages\\" Researchgate Project Goalhttps://www.researchgate.net/project/The-EH-II-site-at-Lambayanna-Argolid- artifacts-and- assemblageshttps://www.esag.swiss/kiladha/https://www.speroforum.com/a/TJGTRQPMJA31/76356-Bronze- Age-Greek-city-found-underwater#.XK3PiKRlASY https://www.tornosnews.gr/en/greek-news/culture/30317-%CE%B9ntricate- buildings-and-buried-architectural-remains-unearthed-in-valley-of-argolis.html The Bay of Kiladha Project continues to study the find at Lambayanna, while maintaining its search for a prehistoric settlement directly off the shore of Franchthi Cave.https://bop.unibe.ch/baf/article/view/3503  References  Citations  Sources = * Farrand, William R. 1999.

A Pretty Patience The “Shamrock”, The Australian woman's mirror. Article : 1928, Page:17 Rules The game is layout out as in La Belle Lucie: seventeen piles of three cards are placed on the table with one card counting as an eighteenth. Any card that can be moved to the foundations should be moved and built up by suit (starting from the ace). The top card of each pile can be used for play and once a pile is empty, it cannot be refilled. But its similarity to La Belle Lucie ends there. Before the game begins, each King which is on top or middle of its respective pile is placed underneath. (Morehead and Mott-Smith's rules to the game specifically states that a King that is on top of a lower- ranked card of the same suit should be placed under that lower-ranked card, no matter what else in its pile). Some rules suggest that they don't move kings to the bottom of the stacks and just leave them there no matter which cards are on there regardless of suit or rank (as pictured on the right →). To play on the tableau, a card can be placed over a card that is one rank higher or lower, regardless of suit (a 6♠ can be placed on a 7♣ or a 5♦). However, each pile can hold no more than three cards at a time; thus no card can be placed on a pile with three cards. The game is won when all of the cards have been moved to the foundations.

He is considered one of the great Hebrew poets, identified with nature poetry, and as a poet greatly influenced by the culture of ancient Greece.  Biography Shaul Tchernichovsky was born on 20 August 1875 in the village of Mykhailivka, Mykhailivka Raion, Taurida Governorate (now in Zaporizhia Oblast, Ukraine). He attended a modern Jewish primary school and transferred to a secular Russian school at the age of 10.Jewish Virtual Library, Shaul Tchernichovsky He published his first poems in Odessa where he studied from 1890 to 1892 and became active in Zionist circles.Jewish Virtual Library, Shaul Tchernichovsky His first published poem was \\"In My Dream.\\" From 1929 to 1930 he spent time in America. In 1931, he immigrated to the British Mandate of Palestine and settled there permanently.The Zionist Ideas: Visions for the Jewish Homeland—then, Now, Tomorrow, Gil Troy He was a friend of the Klausner family of Jerusalem, including the child who would grow up to become the novelist Amos Oz, to whom he was \\"Uncle Shaul.\\" Shaul Tchernichovsky died in Jerusalem on 14 October 1943. Medical career From 1899 to 1906 he studied medicine at the University of Heidelberg, finishing his medical studies in Lausanne. From then on, he mingled his activities as a doctor with his activities as a poet. After completing his studies he returned to Ukraine to practice in Kharkiv and in Kiev. In the First World War he served as an army doctor in Minsk and in Saint Petersburg.Jewish Medicine: What It Is and Why It Matters, Michael Nevins Tchernichovsky served as doctor of the Herzliya Hebrew High School in Tel Aviv. In his later years he served as doctor for the Tel Aviv schools. Literary career Poetry= Shaul Tchernichovsky in his youth Tchernichovsky's grave in Tel Aviv In the poetry of Tchernichovsky there is a blend of the influences of Jewish cultural heritage and world cultural heritage. He writes on Hebrew subjects as in \\"In Endor\\", a poem about King Saul. Saul comes to the witch of Endor, who dramatically describes Saul's condition at the end of his life. Tchernichovsky particularly identified with the character of Saul, perhaps due to his own name. He further describes in the poem the tragic fall of Saul and his sons on Mount Gilboa. In contrast, in the poem \\"Before a Statue of Apollo\\", the poet proves his affinity for Greek culture, identifying with the beauty it represents, even bowing down to it. Tchernichovsky is the Hebrew poet most identified with the sonnet. He introduced the crown of sonnets () into the Hebrew language as a \\"sonnet\\" built of fifteen sonnets in which the final sonnet consists of the first lines of the other fourteen sonnets. Each of his crowns of sonnets concerns a particular topic, such as \\"On Blood\\" or \\"To the Sun\\". Even with his yen for world culture, Tchernichovsky is identified with the fate of his people. In response to the Holocaust he wrote the poems \\"The Slain of Tirmonye\\" and \\"Ballads of Worms\\" that brought into expression his heart's murmurings concerning the tragic fate of the Jewish people. Toward the end of his life he composed some poems that are centered on images from his childhood point of view. These poems, which can properly be termed idylls, are regarded by many as his most splendid poetic works. Some even believe that Tchernichovsky's idylls serve as an example and a model for all of the idylls that have been written in the Hebrew language. Many of his poems have been set to music by the best Hebrew popular composers, such as Yoel Angel and Nahum Nardi. Singer-songwriters have also set his lyrics to music, as Shlomo Artzi did for They Say There Is a Land (omrim yeshna eretz, אומרים ישנה ארץ), which is also well known in the settings of Joel Engel and of Miki Gavrielov. Oh My Land My Birthplace (hoy artzi moladeti, ) is better known in the setting by Naomi Shemer, as arranged by Gil Aldema. Shalosh atonot (Three Jenny-asses, ) also became a popular song. From 1925 to 1932 he was one of the editors of the newspaper Hatekufa. He also edited the section on medicine in the Hebrew encyclopedia Eshkol. =Translation= Tchernichovsky was known as an skilled translator.Celebrating the Life and Work of Shaul Tchernichovsky, One of Modern Hebrew’s Greatest Poets His translation of Homer's Iliad and Odyssey particularly earned recognition. He also translated Sophocles, Horace, Shakespeare, Molière, Pushkin, Goethe, Heine, Byron, Shelley, the Kalevala, the Gilgamesh Cycle, the Icelandic Edda, etc. Tchernichovsky on the 50 NIS banknote =Editing and linguistics= He was active in writers' organizations and a member of the Committee of the Hebrew Language. He was also the editor of the Hebrew terminology manual for medicine and the natural sciences. Awards and recognition Tchernichovsky was twice awarded the Bialik Prize for literature, in 1940 (jointly with Zelda Mishkovsky) and in 1942 (jointly with Haim Hazaz). After his death, the Tel Aviv municipality dedicated a prize for exemplary translation in his name. A school in Tel Aviv is named after him, as is the center for the Hebrew Writers Association in Israel. Many other towns in Israel have also named streets and schools after him. In 2011, Shaul Tchernichovsky was chosen to be one of four Israeli poets whose portraits would be on Israeli currency (together with Leah Goldberg, Rachel Bluwstein, and Nathan Alterman);Nadav Shemer, The Jerusalem Post, 3 October 2011 the 50 NIS bill was unveiled on 10 September 2014.

The algorithm was invented by Andrew Donald Booth in 1950 while doing research on crystallography at Birkbeck College in Bloomsbury, London. Booth's algorithm is of interest in the study of computer architecture. The algorithm Booth's algorithm examines adjacent pairs of bits of the 'N'-bit multiplier Y in signed two's complement representation, including an implicit bit below the least significant bit, y−1 = 0. For each bit yi, for i running from 0 to N − 1, the bits yi and yi−1 are considered. Where these two bits are equal, the product accumulator P is left unchanged. Where yi = 0 and yi−1 = 1, the multiplicand times 2i is added to P; and where yi = 1 and yi−1 = 0, the multiplicand times 2i is subtracted from P. The final value of P is the signed product. The representations of the multiplicand and product are not specified; typically, these are both also in two's complement representation, like the multiplier, but any number system that supports addition and subtraction will work as well. As stated here, the order of the steps is not determined. Typically, it proceeds from LSB to MSB, starting at i = 0; the multiplication by 2i is then typically replaced by incremental shifting of the P accumulator to the right between steps; low bits can be shifted out, and subsequent additions and subtractions can then be done just on the highest N bits of P. There are many variations and optimizations on these details. The algorithm is often described as converting strings of 1s in the multiplier to a high-order +1 and a low-order −1 at the ends of the string. When a string runs through the MSB, there is no high-order +1, and the net effect is interpretation as a negative of the appropriate value. A typical implementation arithmometer from 1960. Each turn of the crank handle adds (up) or subtracts (down) the operand set to the top register from the value in the accumulator register at the bottom. Shifting the adder left or right multiplies the effect by ten. Booth's algorithm can be implemented by repeatedly adding (with ordinary unsigned binary addition) one of two predetermined values A and S to a product P, then performing a rightward arithmetic shift on P. Let m and r be the multiplicand and multiplier, respectively; and let x and y represent the number of bits in m and r. # Determine the values of A and S, and the initial value of P. All of these numbers should have a length equal to (x + y + 1). ## A: Fill the most significant (leftmost) bits with the value of m. Fill the remaining (y + 1) bits with zeros. ## S: Fill the most significant bits with the value of (−m) in two's complement notation. Fill the remaining (y + 1) bits with zeros. ## P: Fill the most significant x bits with zeros. To the right of this, append the value of r. Fill the least significant (rightmost) bit with a zero. # Determine the two least significant (rightmost) bits of P. ## If they are 01, find the value of P + A. Ignore any overflow. ## If they are 10, find the value of P + S. Ignore any overflow. ## If they are 00, do nothing. Use P directly in the next step. ## If they are 11, do nothing. Use P directly in the next step. # Arithmetically shift the value obtained in the 2nd step by a single place to the right. Let P now equal this new value. # Repeat steps 2 and 3 until they have been done y times. # Drop the least significant (rightmost) bit from P. This is the product of m and r. Example Find 3 × (−4), with m = 3 and r = −4, and x = 4 and y = 4: * m = 0011, -m = 1101, r = 1100 * A = 0011 0000 0 * S = 1101 0000 0 * P = 0000 1100 0 * Perform the loop four times: *# P = 0000 1100 0. The last two bits are 00. *#* P = 0000 0110 0. Arithmetic right shift. *# P = 0000 0110 0. The last two bits are 00. *#* P = 0000 0011 0. Arithmetic right shift. *# P = 0000 0011 0.

Arithmetic right shift. * The product is 1111 0100, which is −12\\\\. The above- mentioned technique is inadequate when the multiplicand is the most negative number that can be represented (e.g. if the multiplicand has 4 bits then this value is −8). One possible correction to this problem is to add one more bit to the left of A, S and P. This then follows the implementation described above, with modifications in determining the bits of A and S; e.g., the value of m, originally assigned to the first x bits of A, will be assigned to the first x+1 bits of A. Below, the improved technique is demonstrated by multiplying −8 by 2 using 4 bits for the multiplicand and the multiplier: * A = 1 1000 0000 0 * S = 0 1000 0000 0 * P = 0 0000 0010 0 * Perform the loop four times: *# P = 0 0000 0010 0. The last two bits are 00. *#* P = 0 0000 0001 0. Right shift. *# P = 0 0000 0001 0. The last two bits are 10. *#* P = 0 1000 0001 0. P = P + S. *#* P = 0 0100 0000 1. Right shift. *# P = 0 0100 0000 1. The last two bits are 01. *#* P = 1 1100 0000 1. P = P + A. *#* P = 1 1110 0000 0. Right shift. *# P = 1 1110 0000 0. The last two bits are 00. *#* P = 1 1111 0000 0. Right shift. * The product is 11110000 (after discarding the first and the last bit) which is −16\\\\. How it works Consider a positive multiplier consisting of a block of 1s surrounded by 0s. For example, 00111110. The product is given by: : M \\\\times \\\\,^{\\\\prime\\\\prime} 0 \\\\; 0 \\\\; 1 \\\\; 1 \\\\; 1 \\\\; 1 \\\\; 1 \\\\; 0 \\\\,^{\\\\prime\\\\prime} = M \\\\times (2^5 + 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1) = M \\\\times 62 where M is the multiplicand. The number of operations can be reduced to two by rewriting the same as : M \\\\times \\\\,^{\\\\prime\\\\prime} 0 \\\\; 1 \\\\; 0 \\\\;0 \\\\;0 \\\\; 0 \\\\mbox{-1} \\\\; 0 \\\\,^{\\\\prime\\\\prime} = M \\\\times (2^6 - 2^1) = M \\\\times 62. In fact, it can be shown that any sequence of 1s in a binary number can be broken into the difference of two binary numbers: : (\\\\ldots 0 \\\\overbrace{1 \\\\ldots 1}^{n} 0 \\\\ldots)_{2} \\\\equiv (\\\\ldots 1 \\\\overbrace{0 \\\\ldots 0}^{n} 0 \\\\ldots)_{2} - (\\\\ldots 0 \\\\overbrace{0 \\\\ldots 1}^{n} 0 \\\\ldots)_2. Hence, the multiplication can actually be replaced by the string of ones in the original number by simpler operations, adding the multiplier, shifting the partial product thus formed by appropriate places, and then finally subtracting the multiplier. It is making use of the fact that it is not necessary to do anything but shift while dealing with 0s in a binary multiplier, and is similar to using the mathematical property that 99 = 100 − 1 while multiplying by 99. This scheme can be extended to any number of blocks of 1s in a multiplier (including the case of a single 1 in a block). Thus, : M \\\\times \\\\,^{\\\\prime\\\\prime} 0 \\\\; 0 \\\\; 1 \\\\; 1 \\\\; 1 \\\\; 0 \\\\; 1 \\\\; 0 \\\\,^{\\\\prime\\\\prime} = M \\\\times (2^5 + 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^1) = M \\\\times 58 : M \\\\times \\\\,^{\\\\prime\\\\prime} 0 \\\\; 1 \\\\; 0 \\\\; 0 \\\\mbox{-1} \\\\; 1 \\\\mbox{-1} \\\\; 0 \\\\,^{\\\\prime\\\\prime} = M \\\\times (2^6 - 2^3 + 2^2 - 2^1) = M \\\\times 58. Booth's algorithm follows this old scheme by performing an addition when it encounters the first digit of a block of ones (0 1) and a subtraction when it encounters the end of the block (1 0). This works for a negative multiplier as well. When the ones in a multiplier are grouped into long blocks, Booth's algorithm performs fewer additions and subtractions than the normal multiplication algorithm.

They were popularly called \\"Grey Monks\\" because of their grey robes, which their spiritual cousins, the monks of Savigny, also wore. History Tiron =Founder= The order, or congregation, of Tiron was founded in about 1106 by the Benedictine Bernard de Ponthieu, also known as Bernard d'Abbeville (1046–1117), born in a small village near Abbeville, Ponthieu. Tonsured at the Benedictine Abbey of Saint- Cyprien in Poitiers around the year 1070, Bernard left the order in 1101 when his nomination as abbot of Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe was disapproved by Cluny and Pope Paschal II. From then on Bernard lived first as a hermit on the island of Chausey, between Jersey and Saint-Malo, then in the woods of Craon, near Angers, with two other rigorist monks: Robert d'Arbrissel, future founder of the controversial Abbey of Fontevraud, and Vitalis de Mortain, later the founder of the Congregation of Savigny in 1113. Following the example of the Desert Fathers, all three men and their followers (men and women) lived detached from the world, in great poverty and strict penance. =Followers of Bernard of Thiron= Adelelmus was a hermit and disciple of St. Bernard of Thiron. Born in Flanders, Belgium, Aldelelmus is best known for founding the . =Tiron Abbey= The foundation of Tiron Abbey by Bernard of Abbeville was part of wider movements of monastic reform in Europe in the eleventh and twelfth centuries.Geoffrey Grossus The Life of Blessed Bernard of Tiron, (Ruth Harwood Cline, trans.), The Catholic University of America Press, (2009) As a pre-Cistercian reformer, Bernard's intention was to restore the asceticism and strict observance of the Rule of St. Benedict in monastic life, insisting on manual labour. He founded his monastery on land in Thiron-Gardais granted to him by Bishop Ivo of Chartres,\\"S. Bernard and his Foundation\\", The Benedictines of Caldey, The Abbey, Isle of Caldey, 1912 and placed it under the protection of the cathedral canons of Chartres, instead of a secular overlord. This assured that decisions affecting the Abbey were made by a corporate religious body. Bernard admitted artisans and encourage them to produce goods for sale. During years of famine, Tiron endured great poverty and became a refugee camp and soup kitchen. During the famine of 1109–1111 the Abbey sheltered whole families. Tiron had a school; and after Bernard's death, built houses so that lay women could reside within its walls under the care and protection of the monks. Roger de Port was buried here. =Tironensian Order= Tiron was the first of the new religious orders to spread internationally.\\"Tironensian\\", Monastic Wales Within less than five years of its creation, the Order of Tiron owned 117 priories and abbeys in France, England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. St Dogmaels Abbey In 1113 Robert FitzMartin granted the Tironensians land and money to found the order's first house in Wales, St Dogmaels, Pembrokeshire, which was established on the site of a clas (early Celtic church), which dated back to at least 600 AD. Closed during the Dissolution of the monasteries, much of the stone was quarried for other uses.\\"St Dogmaels Abbey's influence remains after 900 years\\", BBC News south West Wales, March 31, 2013 Kelso Abbey In Scotland, the Tironensians were the monks and master craftsmen who built and occupied (until the Reformation) the abbeys of Selkirk (later re-located to Kelso) (1128), Arbroath (1178), Kilwinning (1140+), and Lindores Abbey, Newburgh, Fife. The first two abbots of Selkirk became, in turn, abbots at Tiron. During the tenure of William of Poitiers as abbot, Tiron established abbeys and priories along the north-south trade routes from Chartres to the navigable Seine and Loire rivers. Under him, the abbey owned at least one ship that traded in Scotland and Northumberland. Tiron adopted a system of annual general chapters. In 1120, Abbot William decreed that abbots from overseas need only attend once in every three years. Arnold, Abbot of Kelso, founded the cathedral church at St Andrews.Barrow, G.W.S., The Kingdom of the Scots, Edinburgh University Press, 2003 In France, the order was integrated into the new Benedictine Congregation of St Maur in 1627.

This provides a non-collapsible entry point into the systemic venous system. This technique is used to provide fluids and medication when intravenous access is not available or not feasible. Intraosseous infusions allow for the administered medications and fluids to go directly into the vascular system. A comparison of intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM), and intraosseous (IO) routes of administration concluded that the intraosseous route is demonstrably superior to intramuscular and comparable to intravenous administration (in delivering paediatric anaesthetic drugs). This route of fluid and medication administration is an alternative one to the preferred intravascular route when the latter cannot be established in a timely manner. Intraosseous infusions are utilized when trauma patients have compromised intravenous access and need immediate delivery of life saving fluids and medications. Effectiveness This American Heart Association guideline cited two randomized controlled trials, one of 60 children and one of electively cannulated hematology/oncology patients. In addition, uncontrolled studies have been performed, one of which reported 72% to 87% rates of successful insertion. The manubrium of the sternum supports the fastest uptake of drugs and fluids into the systemic circulation even during cardiac arrest. The time to peak plasma concentrations of drugs via sternal IO during an arrest model was found to be 80-110 seconds which was not significantly longer than the 60-80 seconds for central access. Procedure EZ Io by Arrow Teleflex Axial CT with left humeral head EZ IO infusion of contrast. BIG IO devices The needle is injected through the bone's hard cortex and into the soft marrow interior which allows immediate access to the vascular system. The IO needle is positioned at a 90 degree angle to the injection site, and the needle is advanced through manual traction, impact driven force, or power driven. Each IO device has different designated insertion locations. The most common site of insertion is the antero-medial aspect of the upper, proximal tibia as it lies just under the skin and is easily located. This is on the upper and inner portion of the tibia. Other insertion sites include the anterior aspect of the femur, the superior iliac crest, proximal humerus, proximal tibia, distal tibia, sternum (manubrium). An IO infusion can be used on adult or pediatric patients when traditional methods of vascular access are difficult or otherwise cause unwanted delayed management of the administration of medications. The IO site can be used for 24 hours and should be removed as soon as intravenous access has been gained. Prolonged use of an IO site, lasting longer than 24 hours, is associated with osteomyelitis (an infection in the bone).NIO IO deviceIntraosseous infusions have several contraindications, including sites that have known, or suspected fracture, appear to be infected, or where the skin is burned. Medical conditions that might also preclude the use of intraosseous infusion include osteopenia, osteopetrosis, and osteogenesis imperfecta as fractures are more likely to occur. The procedure also only allows for one attempt per bone meaning another route of infusion must be secured, or a different bone chosen. Although intravascular access is still the preferred method for medication delivery in the prehospital area, IO access for adults has become more common. As of 2010, American Heart Association no longer recommends using the endotracheal tube for resuscitation drugs, except as a last resort when IV or IO access cannot be gained. ET absorption of medications is poor and optimal drug dosings are unknown. The IO is becoming more common in civilian and military based pre-hospital emergency medical services (EMS) systems globally. Intraosseous access has roughly the same absorption rate as IV access, and allows for fluid resuscitation. For example, sodium bicarbonate can be administered IO during a cardiac arrest when IV access is unavailable. High flow rates are attainable with an IO infusion, up to 125 milliliters per minute. This high rate of flow is achieved using a pressure bag to administer the infusion directly into the bone. Large volume IO infusions are known to be painful. 1% lidocaine is used to ease the pain associated with large volume IO infusions in conscious patients. Devices The automatic intra-osseous devices allow quick and safe access to the patient's vascular system for fluid and drug administration. There are several FDA approved IO devices, categorized by their mechanism of action: # Power Driver: EZ-IO By Arrow Teleflex. # Spring Loaded: BIG Bone Injection Gun and NIO # Manual / Hand Powered : Fast 1, Fast Combat and Fast Responder, Cook IO Needle and The Janshidi 15G All these Needles have their Civil and Military Application. There have been several studies comparing the EZ-IO and the BIG. Another paper compared the EZ-IO with the Cook IO needle.

(Melway ref: 15 A10). Entry is via Keilor Park Drive which is off the Western Ring Road. In 1976 Brimbank Park was opened as part of the Maribyrnong Valley Park, combined with the adjacent Horseshoe Bend Children's farm and Greenvale Reservoir Park. The Maribyrnong River has hollowed out a valley some 55 metres below the Keilor Plain, with a steep bank on the northern side and gentle terraces on the southern side forming a huge amphitheatre. The park has several sheltered picnic areas, gas barbecues, picnic tables, and playgrounds. For those who forget their picnic basket, there is the Leaping Lizard Cafe in the visitors centre. A network of cycling and walking tracks cross the park, as well as self-guided walking trails. For the adventurous, the Maribyrnong River Trail starts at the park and follows the tree lined river 25 km to Footscray. A wetlands area has been extensively revegetated. Birds commonly seen in the park include blue wrens, yellow-tailed thornbills, flame robins, parrots and galahs, and a variety of water birds. Residing in the River Red Gums are Brush-tailed and Ring-tailed possums. You may see a Blue-tongued lizard sunbaking, or catch sight of some swamp wallabies. History Maribyrnong River at Brimbank Park * 400 million years ago: Sedimentary rock and fossils found in the Organ Pipes National Park indicates the area was once a sea. * One million years ago: A flood basalt erupting lava, in some parts up to 70 metres deep, from surrounding volcanoes, creates the Keilor Plain. * Maribyrnong River and its tributaries: Jacksons Creek and Deep Creek create deep valleys in the basaltic plain. * About 40,000 years ago: first signs of possible human habitation along the river. The Keilor Cranium and femur of an aboriginal person, found in 1940 in a sand bank, has been carbon dated at about 12,000 years. The area is home to the Wurundjeri people of the Kulin nation.Paleoanthropology—Keilor Cranium * Late 1830s Europeans first settled the area, and used the fertile river valley as stock runs. They often drove stock around the brim of the bank, thus the park's name, Brimbank. * 1880s land used for dairy farms and apricot orchards. * 1975 Parks Victoria started operating the adjacent Horshoe Bend 26 acre (10.5 hectare) farm. * 1976 Brimbank Park opened by Parks Victoria.

The first existence is documented 1872 in The Dogs of British Island. DescriptionAppearance= Miniature Bull Terrier in black, white and tan (tricolor) Miniature Bull Terriers have short, fine, and glossy coats that are very close to the skin, like Bull Terriers. They are accepted in the ring to be white, white with another colour, or fully coloured. However, like the Bull Terriers, any blue or liver-coloured coats are undesirable. These dogs require minimal grooming. In the early 1900s, the difference between the breeds was determined by the dog's weight. However, this led to Miniature Bull Terriers becoming so small and fine that they looked more like a Chihuahua than a Bull Terrier. So, in the 1970s, the weight limit was replaced with a height limit of under fourteen inches. They are usually no smaller than ten inches. According to the AKC, miniature bull terriers' weight must be proportionate to its height. However, they tend to range anywhere from 20–35 lbs. The Miniature Bull Terriers have a very bold build. They have very muscular shoulders and a full body. Like the Bull Terrier, they have a head described as \\"egg-shaped\\". It is flat on top with a Roman nose. The eyes are triangular and closely set. The ears are carried erect and are not cropped or otherwise altered. The tail is carried horizontally rather than vertically. =Temperament= Like Bull Terriers, Miniature Bull Terriers are loving and, like many terrier breeds, they can be stubborn at times; but despite this they make great dogs for people with limited space. Miniature Bull Terriers are known to be stubborn and courageous. Despite their dimuitive stature, they will readily challenge larger dogs. However, as with any dog, owners can reduce the likelihood of confrontations by providing appropriate training. They are very energetic and playful and love people, but care must be taken as they are variable around other dogs. Miniature Bull Terriers require little grooming. A quick brushing once a day or a few times a week is sufficient. Sunscreen must be used on any sparse white sections of fur around the face, ears, hindquarters or stomach when outdoors (especially in summer between the hours of 10am and 2pm) to avoid sunburn and cancer. =Training= Miniatures are independent and stubborn and do require a lot of training, particularly early on. They must be heavily socialized at a young age and trained to obey early in their lives. They also are very energetic and seem to be able to play endlessly as puppies. However, as they grow older, they become less energetic. They must be carefully exercised and dieted to avoid obesity. Health Miniature Bull Terriers are prone to many health problems (physiologic and psychologic), and anyone considering adopting a bull terrier must be aware of these issues. Deafness occurs in both coloured and white Miniature Bull Terriers. Puppies can be born unilaterally deaf (deaf in one ear) or bilaterally deaf (deaf in both ears). Deaf dogs should not be bred due to deafness being hereditary. BEAP (or BAER) testing is done on puppies prior to sale to discover which puppies have hearing problems. Lethal Acrodermatitis or LAD is a lethal genetic degenerative disease found in Miniature Bull Terriers. It starts appearing in puppies around the age of 4 weeks. The usual black color of affected puppies will start to appear diluted and turn liverish, due to a zinc deficiency which results in a terrible skin condition, dysfunction of their overall system and eventually premature death. A new DNA test was released to test breeding stock and ensure LAD-clear puppies. Miniature Bull Terriers are also susceptible to having luxating patellas. This is a knee problem common in small dogs. It can be treated by surgery. Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) and Bull Terrier hereditary nephritis (BTHN) are autosomal dominant diseases. PKD is diagnosed by an Ultrasonic scan by a specialist veterinarian. BTHN is diagnosed by a UPC test. Dogs with a score of .3 or below are considered clear of the disease. Clearing breeding stock prior to use ensures that progeny are not affected with the disease. Miniature Bull Terriers are also susceptible to eye problems such as primary lens luxation. PLL is a late onset disease which typically affects dogs between the ages of mid 2 and 7. Younger and older cases are known. During September 2009 a definitive DNA test was released by the Animal Health Trust. This test gives three results: Clear, Carrier, or Affected. Aortic valve stenosis and mitral valve dysplasia are heart diseases. Diagnosis is made by colour doppler echocardiography scanning by a specialist veterinarian. Disorders of the skin of a Miniature Bull Terrier can occur. Pyotraumatic dermatitis (hot spots), allergic reactions, and hives can be problematic. U.K. and U.S. breed surveys shows an average lifespan of 10-14 years. History When the Bull Terrier breed was first created in 19th century England, it was about the same size as the Miniature Bull Terrier. Miniature Bull Terriers were granted membership in the American Kennel Club (AKC) on May 14, 1991 (effective January 1, 1992). Interbreeding Interbreeding, the process of mating together a Miniature Bull Terrier and Bull Terrier, is allowed, but only for a short time, in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Interbreeding is undertaken to reduce the incidence of Primary Lens Luxation in the Miniature. The Bull Terrier does not carry the PLL gene, so all progeny are phenotypically normal for the disease.

HinduismYoga Sutras of Patanjali= In the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, nirvikalpa samadhi is a synonym for Asamprajnata Samadhi, the highest stage of samadhi.Sri Swami Sivananda, Raja Yoga Samadhi Samadhi is of two kinds, with and without support of an object of meditation: * Samprajnata Samadhi, also called savikalpa samadhi and Sabija SamadhiSwami Sivananda, Samprajnata Samadhi (\\"samadhi with seed),Yogapedia, Nirbija Samadhi meditation with support of an object. Samprajata samadhi is associated with deliberation, reflection, bliss, and I-am-ness. :The first two associations, deliberation and reflection, form the basis of the various types of samapatti: :* Savitarka, \\"deliberative\\": The citta is concentrated upon a gross object of meditation, an object with a manifest appearance that is perceptible to our senses, such as a flame of a lamp, the tip of the nose, or the image of a deity. Conceptualization (vikalpa) still takes place, in the form of perception, the word and the knowledge of the object of meditation. When the deliberation is ended this is called nirvitaka samadhi. :* Savichara, \\"reflective\\": the citta is concentrated upon a subtle object of meditation, which is not perceptible to the senses, but arrived at through interference, such as the senses, the process of cognition, the mind, the I-am-ness, the chakras, the inner-breath (prana), the nadis, the intellect (buddhi). The stilling of reflection is called nirvichara samapatti. :The last two associations, sananda samadhi and sasmita, are respectively a state of meditation, and an object of savichara samadhi: :* Sananda Samadhi, ananda, \\"bliss\\": this state emphasizes the still subtler state of bliss in meditation; :* Sasmita: the citta is concentrated upon the sense or feeling of \\"I-am-ness\\". *Asamprajnata Samadhi, also called Nirvikalpa Samadhi and Nirbija Samadhi (\\"samadhi without seed),: meditation without an object,Swami Jnaneshvara Bharati, Integrating 50+ Varieties of Yoga Meditation which leads to knowledge of purusha or consciousness, the subtlest element. Heinrich Zimmer in his book distinguishes Nirvikalpa Samadhi from other states as follows: Swami Sivananda Nirbija Samadhi, \\"without seeds,\\" as follows: =Shaivism= Nirvikalpaka yoga is a technical term in the philosophical system of Shaivism, in which there is a complete identification of the \\"I\\" and Shiva, in which the very concepts of name and form disappear and Shiva alone is experienced as the real Self. In that system, this experience occurs when there is complete cessation of all thought-constructs. Buddhism While Patanjali was influenced by Buddhism, and incorporated Buddhist thought and terminology,Robert Thurman, The Central Philosophy of Tibet. Princeton University Press, 1984, page 34. the term \\"nirvikalpa samadhi\\" is unusual in a Buddhist context, though some authors have equated nirvikalpa samadhi with the formless jhanas and/or nirodha samapatti.Partial transcript from the workshop entitled “Self-Discovery through Buddhist Meditation”, presented by John Myrdhin Reynolds at Phoenix, Arizona, on October 20, 2001, http://www.vajranatha.com/articles/what-is- meditation.html?showall=1Donald Jay Rothberg, Sean M. Kelly (1998), Ken Wilber in Dialogue: Conversations with Leading Transpersonal ThinkersCandradhara Śarmā (1996), The Advaita Tradition in Indian Philosophy: A Study of Advaita in Buddhism, Vedānta and Kāshmīra Shaivism, Motilal Banarsidass, p.139: \\"In the Buddhist works, both in Pale and in Sanskrit, the words used for nirvikalpa-samadhi are samnja-vedayita-nirodha and nirodha-samapatti.\\" Yet, according to Jianxin Li, it is asamprajnata samadhi, c.q. savikalpa samadhi and sabija samadhi, Patanjali's first stage of meditation with a (subtle) object, that may be compared to the arupa jhanas of Buddhism, and to Nirodha- Samapatti. Crangle also notes that sabija-asamprajnata samadhi resembles the four formless jhanas. According to Crangle, the fourth arupa jhana is the stage of transition to Patanjali's \\"consciousness without seed,\\" c.q. nirvikalpa samadhi. Crangle further notes that the first jhana also resembles sabija-asamprajnata samadhi. According to Gombrich and Wynne the first and second jhana represent concentration, whereas the third and fourth jhana combine concentration with mindfulness. In the Buddhist canonical texts, the word \\"jhāna\\" is never explicitly used to denote the four formless jhānas; they are instead referred to as āyatana. However, they are sometimes mentioned in sequence after the first four jhānas (other texts. e.g. MN 121 treat them as a distinct set of attainments) and thus came to be treated by later exegetes as jhānas. The immaterial attainments have more to do with expanding, while the Jhanas (1–4) focus on concentration. The relation between dhyāna and insight is a core problem in the study of early Buddhism. According to tradition, the Buddha had mastered several forms of formless meditation states, without attaining liberation, or the cessation of suffering and rebirth. This was attained when he recalled his past lives, gained insight into the cycle of rebirth, and gained direct insight into the four noble truths.Sutta 36 of the Majjhima Nikkaya - Mahā Saccaka Sutta, Translated by Thanissaro Bhikkhu, https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/MN/MN36.htmlSutta 2 of the Digha Nikkaya - Samaññaphala Sutta, Translated by Thanissaro Bhikkhu, https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.02.0.than.html Yet, according to Schmithausen, the four noble truths as \\"liberating insight\\" may be a later addition to texts such as Majjhima Nikaya 36, and liberating insight and samadhi are alternately accentuated as the highest means to salvation throughout the Buddhist traditions. The technical Yogacara term ' is translated by Edward Conze as \\"undifferentiated cognition\\". Conze notes that, in Yogacara, only the actual experience of ' can prove the reports given of it in scriptures. He describes the term as used in the Yogacara context as follows: A different sense in Buddhist usage occurs in the Sanskrit expression ' (Pali: ') that means \\"makes free from uncertainty (or false discrimination)\\" = distinguishes, considers carefully.

It serves as the administrative seat for the surrounding municipality of the same name. The municipality covers an area of 336 km² with a population of 40,797 (2018 census). The local people are predominantly Achi Maya Native Americans who speak the Achi Maya language. History The settlement of Rabinal is founded by Bartolomé de Las Casas, during his expedition into the lands of the Maya in 1537. = Spanish conquest and the Dominican friars= On his second visit to Guatemala, in 1537, friar Bartolome de las Casas, O.P. wanted to employ his new method of conversion based on two principles: 1) to preach the Gospel to all men and treat them as equals, and 2) to assert that conversion must be voluntary and based on knowledge and understanding of the Faith. It was important for Las Casas that this method be tested without meddling from secular colonists, so he chose a territory in the heart of Guatemala where there were no previous colonies and where the natives were considered fierce and war-like. Because of the fact that the land had not been possible to conquer by military means, the governor of Guatemala, Alonso de Maldonado, agreed to sign a contract promising that if the venture was successful he would not establish any new encomiendas in the area. Las Casas's group of friars established a Dominican presence in Rabinal, Sacapulas and Cobán, reaching as far as Chahal. Through the efforts of Las Casas' missionaries the so-called \\"Land of War\\" came to be called \\"Verapaz\\", \\"True Peace\\". Las Casas's strategy was to teach Christian songs to merchant Indian Christians who then ventured into the area. In this way he was successful in converting several native chiefs, among them those of Atitlán and Chichicastenango, and in building several churches in the territory named Alta Verapaz. These congregated a group of Christian Indians in the location of what is now the town of Rabinal. In 1538 Las Casas was recalled from his mission by Bishop Francisco Marroquin who wanted him to go to Mexico and then on to Spain in order to seek more Dominicans to assist in the mission. In 1572 construction finished on the grand colonial Catholic Baroque church, a project begun by then Bishop of Chiapas Bartolomé de Las Casas. During the mid-19th century Charles-Étienne Brasseur de Bourbourg, serving as Parish Priest, conducts some of the first ethnographic studies of the highland Maya and collects folk tales and documents making the first translations into European languages, of the Rabinal Achí. As of 1850, the population was estimated to be 6,500. Rabinal is the site of some of the bloodiest massacres in Guatemala's Civil War, including those of Plan de Sánchez and Río Negro. The actual town of Rabinal was also the site of a large-scale massacre during the Independence Day celebration of 1981. = Doctrine of Order of Preachers = Order of Preachers coat of arms. After the conquest, the Spanish crown focused on the Catholic indoctrination of the natives. Human settlements founded by royal missionaries in the New World were called \\"Indian doctrines\\" or simply \\"doctrines\\". Originally, friars had only temporary missions: teach the Catholic faith to the natives, and then transfer the settlements to secular parishes, just like the ones that existed in Spain at the time; the friars were supposed to teach Spanish and Catholicism to the natives. And when the natives were ready, they could start living in parishes and contribute with mandatory tithing, just like the people in Spain. But this plan never materialized, mainly because the Spanish crown lost control of the regular orders as soon as their friars set course to America. Shielded by their apostolic privileges granted to convert natives into Catholicism, the missionaries only responded to their order local authorities, and never to that of the Spanish government or the secular bishops. The orders local authorities, in turn, only dealt with their own order and not with the Spanish crown. Once a doctrine had been established, the protected their own economic interests, even against those of the King and thus, the doctrines became Indian towns that remains unaltered for the rest of the Spanish colony. The doctrines were founded at the friars discretion, given that they were completely at liberty to settle communities provided the main purpose was to eventually transfer it as a secular parish which would be tithing of the bishop. In reality, what happened was that the doctrines grew uncontrollably and were never transferred to any secular parish; they formed around the place where the friars had their monastery and from there, they would go out to preach to settlements that belong to the doctrine and were called \\"annexes\\", \\"visits\\" or \\"visit towns\\". Therefore, the doctrines had three main characteristics: # they were independent from external controls (both ecclesiastical and civilian ) # were run by a group of friars # had a relatively larger number of annexes. The main characteristic of the doctrines was that they were run by a group of friars, because it made sure that the community system would continue without any issue when one of the members died. In 1638, the Order of Preachers split their large doctrines —which meant large economic benefits for them— in groups centered around each one of their six monasteries, and the Rabinal doctrine was moved under the Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala monastery jurisdiction: { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" width=28% - style=\\"color:white;\\" !style=\\"background:#659ec7;\\" align=centerMonastery !style=\\"background:#659ec7;\\" align=centerDoctrines - !style=\\"background:lemonchiffon;\\"Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala  * Chimaltenango * Jocotenango * Sumpango * San Juan Sacatepéquez * San Pedro Sacatepéquez * Santiago Sacatepéquez * Rabinal * San Martín Jilotepeque * Escuintla * Milpas Altas * Milpas Bajas * San Lucas Sacatepéquez * Barrio de Santo Domingo } Culture The town of Rabinal boasts a large, colonial-era baroque church.

He was born in Chioggia, near Venice. Education Veronese earned his laurea in mathematics from the Istituto Tecnico di Venezia in 1872. Work Although Veronese's work was severely criticised as unsound by Peano, he is now recognised as having priority on many ideas that have since become parts of transfinite numbers and model theory, and as one of the respected authorities of the time, his work served to focus Peano and others on the need for greater rigor. He is particularly noted for his hypothesis of relative continuity which was the foundation for his development of the first non-Archimedean linear continuum. Veronese produced several significant monographs. The most famous appeared in 1891, Fondamenti di geometria a più dimensioni e a più specie di unità rettilinee esposti in forma elementare, normally referred to as Fondamenti di geometria to distinguish it from Veronese' other works also styled Fondamenti.

Her family moved to the United States when she was a child because of the economic crisis in the island. She learned how to play the piano at an early age. Boscana graduated from high school and decided to continue her education by enrolling in Oberlin College located in Ohio, where her cousin, Madeline Willemsen, was studying a French language degree. There she earned her bachelor's degree in languages and theater.Lucy Boscana Acting career In 1940, Boscana returned to Puerto Rico. After a stint as an English language teacher in her hometown she enrolled in the University of Puerto Rico to study music and dramatic arts. After graduation, Boscana founded the Puerto Rican Tablado Company, a traveling theater. Among the plays which she produced with the company was \\"The Oxcart\\" by fellow Puerto Rican playwright René Marqués. She presented the play in Puerto Rico and on Off-Broadway in New York City. Boscana participated in over 30 plays and also in various locally produced films. In 1950, she was part of the musical vocal group from Ponce: Las Damiselas, (The Ladies), with Sylvia Rexach, and Marta Romero. On August 22, 1955, Boscana became a pioneer in the television of Puerto Rico when she participated in Puerto Rico's first telenovela (soap opera) titled Ante la Ley, alongside Esther Sandoval and Mario Pabón, which was broadcast by Telemundo, Puerto Rico.

The virus is often carried by grey squirrels from North America, which rarely die from the disease. Elsewhere in the Red Squirrel's European range, either the grey squirrel does not occur or it lacks the poxvirus. Overview Grey squirrels very rarely die from this disease as their population has developed immunity having been exposed to the virus for many years; however, they are still carriers of the infection and can spread the disease to red squirrels. In sharp contrast, there are no known red squirrels that have developed immunity to the disease, and the mortality rate for untreated infected squirrels in the wild appears to be 100%; most dying within 4–5 days of being infected. There has been some more recent anecdotal evidence on resistance to Squirrel pox in the red population including the finding of a healthy red squirrel with antibodies to the virus in Cumbria. However the mortality rate is still considered severe, and certainly capable of local extinction of red squirrels in areas that succumb to the disease. Taxonomy The official ICTV acronym for Squirrelpox virus is SPPV.Genus Parapoxvirus Virus Taxonomy Online. The classification of the virus is still under debate, and the recent studies have suggested that it should be grouped into a clade of its own rather than Parapoxvirus. Transmission The virus can spread through contact with the infected lesions or contaminated crusts, and can also be carried by mosquitoes.Squirrel pox Michigan State Department of Natural Resources Most poxviruses are highly resistant to drying, which allows crusts to remain infectious for long periods of time. It is believed that the virus can be transferred by contaminated feeders, which is why red squirrel preservation organizations often recommend that feeders are disinfected daily. Many poxviruses are potentially zoonotic, and other poxviral infections have been reported in man.Kaaden O-R: Infektionen und Krankheiten durch Pockenviren. In: Medizinische Mikrobiologie, Infektions- und Seuchenlehre, ed. Mayer A, 7ed., pp 158–174, Enke Verlag, Stuttgart, Germany 2002 (from ) However, no cases of transmission to humans are known. Symptoms UK squirrelpox virus is an entirely different virus to that which causes skin fibromas (tumours) in American grey squirrels. UK grey squirrels carry the virus but are unaffected by it whereas in red squirrels, the virus causes skin ulcers, lesions, and scabs. It can also cause swelling and discharge (from the lesions/scabs) near the eyes, mouth, feet, and genitalia. Additionally, squirrels that fall victim to the disease often become increasingly lethargic as it progresses. Infected animals are said to resemble rabbits with myxomatosis, in that they are sometimes found shivering and lethargic. Origins SPPV is found in the eastern part of North America from Ontario in the north to North Carolina in the south. The origins of squirrelpox virus in the UK are mostly unknown. The first confirmed incident was in East Anglia in the 1980s. It has since spread to Lancashire (confirmed in 1995–1996), Cumbria (spring 1998), Durham (1999), and Northumberland (1999). The squirrelpox virus is regarded as a significant factor in the decline of red squirrel populations in the UK. Although the squirrelpox virus has only been recorded once in Scotland, it may be more prevalent due to lack of thorough testing. It is thought to be similar to a case of disease seen in East Anglian red squirrels at the turn of the 20th Century. Long-term effects Although red squirrels were once prevalent throughout the British Isles, there are now only about 140,000. Most of these are in Scotland. The decline of red squirrels is blamed mostly on disease, the loss of woodlands, and competition by grey squirrels. There are over 2.5 million grey squirrels in the British Isles. Red squirrels' survival chances in conifer woods are much higher than in deciduous woods.

This slogan has been incorporated into shopping malls, theme parks (Six Flags), and other enterprises. The six flags fly in front of the state welcome centers on the state's borders with Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Mexico, and Oklahoma. In Austin, the six flags fly in front of the Bullock Texas State History Museum; the Texas State Capitol has the six coats of arms on its northern facade, and the University of Texas at Austin Life Sciences Library, previously the location of the central library in the Main Building, has each coat of arms displayed in plaster emblems with short excerpts representative of the constitutions of each country. The six flags are also shown on the reverse of the Seal of Texas. In 1997 the Texas Historical Commission adopted standard designs for representing the six flags. Spain (1519 to 1685; 1690 to 1821) 100px 100px 100px The first flag belonged to Spain, which ruled most of Texas from 1519 to 1685 and 1690 to 1821. There were three Spanish flags used during this period: the \\"castle and lion\\" arms of the Crown of Castile (see Flag of Castile and León); the Cross of Burgundy, a military and maritime flag also used by the viceroys of New Spain; and the Rojigualda introduced by King Charles III in 1785, containing horizontal stripes of red-gold-red and the simple arms of Castile and León. This third flag has been used by Spain in various forms to the present day, and is the flag used in the reverse of the Seal of Texas and adopted by the Texas Historical Commission.Texas State Library – Six Flags of Texas France (1684 to 1690 for Fort Saint Louis and 1800 to 1803 as French Louisiana) 100px The second flag was the royal banner of the Kingdom of France from 1684 to 1690. In 1684, French nobleman René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, founded a colony on the Texas Gulf Coast called Fort Saint Louis. The colony was unsuccessful, and after La Salle's murder, was soon abandoned. During this time, there was no official French flag, so a number of designs are used in displays of the \\"six flags\\". Later on in 1800, Spain ceded Louisiana to France under the Third Treaty of San Ildefonso. French Louisiana included northern sections of Texas. It remained in the hands of France until 1803, when France sold the Louisiana Territory to the United States. However, what would later be northern Texas was sold back to Spain years later. Mexico (1821 to 1835) 100px The third flag flown (1821 through 1836) was the flag of Mexico. Mexico's independence was recognized by Spain in 1821. The Mexican flag displayed in the Austin Capitol is the one of the Mexican Republic of 1823 through 1864. This flag was in use in Texas until its independence from Mexico in 1836 (Texas' declaration of independence). Republic of Texas (1836 to 1845 as the Republic of Texas; since 1845 as the State of Texas) 100px The fourth flag belonged to the Republic of Texas from 1836 to 1845. The Republic had two national flags during its history, the first being the so- called \\"Burnet Flag\\". The \\"Lone Star Flag\\", the final national flag, became the state flag when Texas joined the United States as a U.S. state in 1845. United States of America (1845 to 1861; 1865 to present) 100px 100px The fifth and current flag is that of the United States of America, which Texas joined in 1845. Upon secession Texas abandoned this flag for its sixth, until readmission to the Union in 1865. Confederate States of America (1861 to 1865) 100px The sixth flag belonged to the Confederate States of America from 1861 to 1865. During this time, the Confederacy had three national flags.

The African fat-tailed gecko is from the subfamily Eublepharinae. Members of this subfamily include the leopard gecko of south Central Asia, India, and Pakistan. This subfamily has clearly different characteristics from other geckos. They are terrestrial and crepuscular, and have moveable eyelids, vertical pupils, and no adhesive lamellae (sticky feet). The African fat-tailed gecko is found in West Africa, from Senegal to Cameroon. Their habitat is dry and arid, although they will spend most of their time in a dark, humid hiding place. In captivity, it is important to provide these geckos with a source of humidity that mimics these conditions. The African fat-tailed gecko is typically around 7-9 inches (18–23 cm), with females being slightly smaller than males. They have a captive lifespan of 10–25 years. Normal coloring is brown and tan/beige stripes, with a possible thin white stripe along the length of the back. The underbelly is pale pink or off-white. The African fat-tailed gecko is equipped with the ability to lose its tail when threatened or attacked. If the tail is lost, the new tail will have a more rounded shape, similar to the head. It may not match the body coloration and pattern of the gecko. The tail is also where they store their fat, an important energy reserve. With its tail, an African fat tailed gecko can go days on end without food.  African fat-tailed geckos as pets  In the pet trade the African fat-tailed gecko has gained some popularity though is still not as popular as the closely related leopard gecko. Unlike the leopard gecko, these geckos tend to be more docile but do have a higher humidity requirement. Through selective breeding the reptile trade has been able to produce numerous color variants of the African fat- tailed gecko including tangerine, albino, patternless, black out, and aberrant fat-tails. While it might seem that you can house these animals together with the similar leopard gecko species, these animals have different heating, humidity, and husbandry requirements. Housing these two species together is never recommended.  Diet  African Fat-Tailed geckos have a primarily insectivorous diet. Mealworms, crickets, roaches, and other small insects are commonly feasted upon by African fat-tailed geckos. African fat-tailed geckos will not eat dead prey, and will only eat live insects. It is recommended to feed them with gut loaded insects no bigger than the space between their eyes, and to feed adults at least three to four times a week. Babies should be fed almost daily. While hornworms and pinky mice seem to be a popular feeder, it is not recommended to use them as even large geckos can choke on them.

According to The Complete Book of Chisanbop by Hang Young Pai, chisanbop was created in the 1940s in Korea by Sung Jin Pai and revised by his son Hang Young Pai. He then brought the system to the United States c. 1977. With the chisanbop method it is possible to display all numbers from 0 to 99 on two hands, and to perform the addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of numbers. The system has been described as being easier to use than a physical abacus by students with visual impairments.  Basic concepts  36 represented in chisanbop, where four fingers and a thumb are touching the table and the rest of the hands are raised. The three fingers on the left hand sum to 30, the right thumb adds 5, and the right index finger adds 1. The hands are held in a relaxed posture on or above a table. All fingers are floating off the table to begin with. The fingers are pressed into the table to indicate value. Each finger (but not the thumb) of the right hand has a value of one. Press the index finger of the right hand onto the table to indicate \\"one.\\" Press the index and middle fingers for \\"two,\\" the three leftmost fingers for \\"three,\\" and all four fingers of the right hand to indicate \\"four.\\" The thumb of the right hand holds the value \\"five.\\" To place the value \\"six,\\" press the right thumb and index finger onto the table. The thumb indicates \\"five\\" plus the \\"one\\" indicated by the finger. The left hand represents the tens digit. It works like the right hand, but each value is multiplied by ten. Each finger on the left hand represents \\"ten,\\" and the left thumb represents \\"fifty.\\" In this way, all values between zero and ninety-nine can be indicated on two hands. Adoption in the United States A school in Shawnee Mission, Kansas, ran a pilot program with students in 1979. It was found that although they could add large numbers quickly, they could not add them in their heads. The program was dropped.

The Crumpet tells the following story, explaining that Bingo is happy because he narrowly escaped getting into trouble with his wife Rosie. Rosie asks Bingo to go to Monte Carlo to take notes she can use in her next novel. Bingo wants to gamble there, but Rosie, the household breadwinner, does not want him to gamble. Instead of giving him money, she has his travel bills sent to her so he is not tempted. Disappointed, Bingo goes to Monte Carlo, and discovers that the wealthy Drone Oofy Prosser is nearby. He gives Oofy lunch, and Oofy is grateful, though he refuses to lend Bingo money. Instead, he gives Bingo a tip to bet on the horse Spotted Dog. Bingo bets ten pounds on credit. The horse loses, and Bingo now owes ten pounds to a bookmaker who threatens that a nasty accident will befall Bingo if he does not pay. Rosie's friend Dora Spurgeon returns Rosie's brooch, a birthday gift from Bingo that Dora had borrowed, to Bingo. He pawns it for five pounds and bets it, intending to use his supposedly unbeatable system (doubling his bet when he wins), yet he loses repeatedly. Playing roulette, he puts his last one hundred francs on Black. Up comes Zero, and his money is swept away by the croupier. Dejected, Bingo is suddenly greeted by Rosie, who was able to come because her luncheon was postponed. She expects to get her brooch back soon, which worries Bingo. Bingo notices a pile of chips on Black worth no less than three thousand, two hundred francs, or about forty pounds. He had forgotten that when Zero comes up, even-odds bets are put \\"in prison\\", or kept on to await the result of the next spin. Distracted by Rosie, he had not taken out his winnings after Black turned up, so it all stayed on Black. Black came up seven more times. Bingo cannot take out his winnings, or else Rosie will see he has been gambling. He tries to make a face at the croupier to signal that he wants his money pushed aside, but the croupier misinterprets him and lets it all ride (meaning Bingo's money will continue to be bet double-or-nothing on Black). Though Bingo is nervous, Black keeps coming up. Some of his winnings are finally pushed aside when his stake reaches the limit for even-odds bets. Rosie leaves at last, and Bingo happily claims forty-eight thousand francs. He buys back Rosie's brooch and goes to her. Rosie confesses that she was tempted to gamble and lost two hundred pounds in ten minutes. She is concerned this will upset Bingo. Bingo assures her that he understands, though he claims not to experience such impulses himself. =\\"Bingo and the Peke Crisis\\"= * US: Saturday Evening Post, May 29, 1937 * UK: Strand, June 1937 ;Plot At the Drones Club, a Bean is upset that Bingo Little tried to give him a Peke which bit the Bean in the leg. A Crumpet tells the Bean that Bingo is more to be pitied than censured, and recounts the following story. Bingo's wife Rosie, the household breadwinner, disapproves of Bingo's gambling habit and keeps him on a tight budget. Bingo wants to bet on a horse but has no capital. Rosie has asked Mr. Purkiss, the proprietor of a children's magazine called Wee Tots, to consider hiring Bingo as editor. Pleased at the prospect of having a salary, Bingo happily agrees to meet Purkiss at Charing Cross. Rosie leaves town, trusting Bingo to look after her six Pekes. She gives Bingo ten pounds to pay a bill for a dog harness. Bingo uses the money to bet on the horse, then meets with Purkiss. A man to whom Bingo owes money walks by, so Bingo flees. The horse loses, Purkiss tells Bingo he will not be hired in a letter (which Bingo tears up), and worst of all, one of Rosie's Pekes is missing. Seeing a butler walking a Peke, Bingo decides to steal the dog to replace the lost one, and follows the pair to a house. He hides until none other than Mr. Purkiss walks outside with the Peke. Bitter about Purkiss's letter, Bingo's ethical qualms about stealing the dog vanish. He sneaks the Peke away using cheese as bait. Later, Bingo's butler Bagshaw tells him one of the Pekes is out having its portrait painted. Bingo now has one too many dogs, but he cannot remember how to return to Purkiss's house, nor can he remember Purkiss's name, and therefore cannot look up his address. Bingo tries to give the Peke to the Bean, but the dog bites the Bean on his leg. (Bingo has agreed to pay for medical expenses.) Bagshaw helps Bingo remember the name of the grocer who sold Bingo cheese, and Bingo finds Purkiss's house from there. Bingo quietly returns the Peke, but it follows him back home. Bagshaw informs Bingo that Purkiss paid a visit. Fearing Purkiss knows all, Bingo decides to ask for mercy. He visits Purkiss formally. Purkiss surprisingly confesses to stealing Bingo's dog; Purkiss, who had been looking after his wife's Peke, let the dog outside without a leash, and the dog vanished. Purkiss visited Bingo's house hoping to buy one of Rosie's dogs, but one of the dogs jumped on his leg. It looked just like the one he lost, so he took the dog. Bingo agrees to let Purkiss keep the dog in exchange for becoming editor. Bingo also asks for a small advance to pay Rosie's bill. =\\"The Editor Regrets\\"= * US: Saturday Evening Post, July 1, 1939 * UK: Strand, September 1939 ;Plot Members of the Drones Club try to sell articles to Bingo Little, editor of the children's magazine Wee Tots, but Bingo rejects them. A Crumpet believes that Bingo enjoys rejecting their articles because he is drunk with power, and that this will get Bingo into trouble. The Crumpet remarks that this nearly happened not long ago, and recounts the following story. Bella Mae Jobson, an American author of children's books, comes to London. Purkiss, Bingo's boss, wants her to contribute to Wee Tots and asks her to see his editor, Bingo. Bingo is not informed about this, and when told by telephone that Jobson has arrived, he feels too important to see someone without an appointment, and refuses to see her. Bingo later tells Purkiss that he sent her away. Purkiss angrily explains Jobson's importance. He then insults and fires Bingo. Bingo does not look forward to telling this to his wife Rosie, who secured him the job, and goes to a party to distract himself. He meets the beautiful Bella Mae Jobson there. Hoping to ingratiate himself with her to impress Purkiss and get his job back, Bingo treats her to meals and gives her gifts, including a signed photograph of himself. She invites him to a lunch party at her hotel suite. Rosie returns from a trip early, and has been invited to Jobson's lunch party, complicating matters. Bingo has not told Jobson he is married and foresees embarrassment if this is discovered, so he writes a telegram to Jobson saying that he cannot attend. He decides to steal the signed photograph to keep Rosie from seeing it. After bribing the maid to access Jobson's suite while she is out walking her dog, Bingo takes the photograph, but is met by Purkiss, who also bribes the maid to enter. Purkiss tries to talk to him but Bingo hurries out. Outside, he sees Rosie. She is on her way to comfort Mrs. Purkiss, who lost her dog. Rosie asks Bingo to tell Jobson that she and Mrs. Purkiss cannot make it to the party. Bingo readily consents, and Rosie leaves. Purkiss asks Bingo for help. To curry Jobson's favour, Purkiss took his wife's Pekingese and gave the dog to Jobson, so he does not want his wife to go to the party and see her dog there. He asks Bingo to prevent his wife from coming to the party. Bingo agrees in exchange for being reinstated as editor. =\\"Sonny Boy\\"= * US: Saturday Evening Post, September 2, 1939 * UK: Strand, December 1939 ;Plot Bingo Little treats his baby, Algernon Aubrey Little, to milk at the Drones Club. A Crumpet tells a Bean, Egg and Pieface the following story about Bingo, his wife, the novelist Rosie M. Banks, and their baby. Like Bingo at the same age, his baby is ugly and resembles a gargoyle. Bingo, an avid gambler always on the lookout for omens, takes this as a sign to bet on a horse named Gargoyle, but the horse loses and Bingo is down ten pounds, leaving him no money for luxuries. To make up the loss, he decides to get money from Oofy Prosser. Oofy is in love, but nonetheless in no mood to lend money. Bingo horns his way into dinner with Oofy and the girl. Oofy resents Bingo's presence and refuses to give him money. Rosie sends Bingo ten pounds to start a bank account for their baby Algy. Bingo walks Algy in a baby carriage in Wimbledon Common. Bingo's bookmaker, Charlie Pikelet, is also walking an ugly baby with a baby carriage. Each man believes his baby is uglier, and Pikelet proposes a wager. Bingo bets ten pounds that Algy is the ugliest baby in Wimbledon, using Algy's ten pounds in the belief that Algy would not object. Pikelet asks a passing policeman to judge the babies. The policeman says that his own baby at home is even uglier, but declares Arabella the winner. Bingo loses the ten pounds. Rosie calls Bingo and says she will be returning from her trip with her mother the next day. She asks Bingo to correct the galley proofs for her Christmas story and send them to her publisher. The story, \\"Tiny Fingers\\", concerns a hard-hearted godfather who disapproves of his goddaughter marrying a young artist, but is moved when their child sits on his knee and writes them a cheque. Bingo, remembering Oofy Prosser is Algy's godfather, is inspired by the story and goes to Oofy's flat with Algy. Oofy's valet, Corker, tells Bingo that Oofy is asleep after a late night. Bingo leaves Algy there and goes to greet Rosie and her mother at Paddington. Upon returning, Bingo finds Oofy alarmed by the baby. Oofy says that Bingo, by ruining his dinner with the girl, saved him from marriage and babies, and thanks Bingo by giving him fifty pounds. =\\"Anselm Gets His Chance\\"= * UK: Strand, July 1937 * US: Saturday Evening Post, July 3, 1937 ;Plot Mr Mulliner remarks that vicars in rural England always preach the sermons on summer evenings, when the congregation is particularly receptive, preventing their curates from having the opportunity. He tells the following story about his cousin Rupert's younger son, Anselm, curate of the parish of Rising Mattock in Hampshire. Anselm is engaged to Myrtle Jellaby, niece of Sir Leopold Jellaby, OBE. Their engagement is secret from Sir Leopold because Anselm only has his modest stipend to marry on. One day, Anselm unexpectedly inherits a stamp album from his late godfather. The album is insured for five thousand pounds. Myrtle warns Anselm to keep the album safe from Joe Beamish, a local man who used to be a burglar. Anselm shows the stamps to Sir Leopold, who collects stamps, hoping to sell it to him for five thousand pounds. Sir Leopold examines the collection and says they are not valuable. He offers ten pounds for the lot and tells him to think it over. Disappointed, Anselm leaves and returns to Myrtle. She suggests they let Joe Beamish know where the stamps are, then collect the insurance money after he steals them. Anselm thinks this plan is unethical, so Myrtle secretly carries it out on her own. She visits Joe and, pretending to be concerned about the security of the stamps, describes the album and where it is kept in the vicarage. At night in the vicarage, Anselm is awoken by sounds. His vicar, the Rev. Sidney Gooch, has a black eye after being punched by a burglar who stole the stamp album. Gooch cannot give sermons the next day because of his black eye, so Anselm will finally get a chance to preach a summer evening sermon. Anselm has been saving a special sermon on Brotherly Love, and preaches it the following evening. It is extremely moving and well received. Later, Anselm tells Myrtle that he is concerned it would be unethical to send a claim to the insurance company when they know the stamp album is nearly worthless. Myrtle convinces him to send in the claim anyway. Joe appears and thanks Anselm for his touching sermon. He was so moved that he has come to return the stamp album he stole. Anselm tries to let Joe keep the album, but Joe insists that it belongs to Anselm. He withdraws, leaving Anselm and Myrtle to discuss their predicament. They hear someone sobbing. It is Sir Leopold, who was also deeply moved by Anselm's sermon. Sir Leopold asks for a pen and ink so he can write Anselm a cheque for ten thousand pounds for his stamp collection. He had recognized that the collection was worth five thousand pounds before but had lied, and now wants to pay Anselm ten thousand for it after hearing his sermon. He is also approving when they tell him of their engagement. Myrtle decides to drive to London immediately and deposit the cheque at the bank, in case Sir Leopold changes his mind. =\\"Romance at Droitgate Spa\\"= * US: Saturday Evening Post, February 20, 1937 * UK: Strand, August 1937 ;Plot Frederick \\"Freddie\\" Fitch-Fitch goes to Droitgate Spa to ask his uncle and trustee, Major-General Sir Aylmer Bastable, to release his capital, so that he can marry Annabel Purvis. Sir Aylmer is in a bad mood because at Droitgate, he is not treated the way he has come to expect because of his aristocratic background and distinguished military record. He merely has a touch of gout, and only those with more serious maladies enjoy high social standing at the spa. Sir Aylmer is also annoyed because his nurse left. Freddie tells him he wants to marry a magician's assistant, but Sir Aylmer won't hear of it. Freddie comes up with a plan: Annabel will become his uncle's new nurse and gain his favour, so when Freddie comes down and appears to fall in love with her, he will consent to Freddie marrying her. Annabel, who has experience nursing her Uncle Joe, agrees to the plan. In three weeks, she ingratiates herself with Sir Aylmer. Freddie comes and Sir Aylmer says Freddie ought to be in love with a girl like Annabel, since she is a good nurse and her late father was a colonel. Just ten minutes later, Freddie says she has accepted his proposal of marriage. Sir Aylmer is surprised but congratulates Freddie nonetheless. Freddie returns to London to get the papers for Sir Aylmer to sign to release his capital. A magician named Mortimer Rackstraw, known as The Great Boloni, comes to see Freddie at his club. Mortimer, while mechanically doing magic tricks out of anxiety, tells Freddie he was engaged to his assistant Annabel, but she ended their engagement to marry Freddie. Mortimer warns he will take revenge on Freddie for stealing the girl he loved. Freddie gets a telegram from Annabel telling him to return to Droitgate Spa at once, though he has to put up with a talkative, unfashionable man on the train. At Droitgate, Annabel tells him that Mortimer has come. She locked him in the cellar, but he will be able to escape soon. He intends to introduce Sir Aylmer to Annabel's unsophisticated Uncle Joe, so that Sir Aylmer will not allow Freddie to marry Annabel. Annabel's uncle Joe is the man Freddie met on the train. Freddie rushes to the Pump Room to have Sir Aylmer sign his legal papers before Mortimer can reach him. However, Sir Aylmer is busy listening to a band playing. The music ends, but then Sir Aylmer is distracted by the distinguished, snobbish Lord Rumbelow. Lord Rumbelow has a complicated case of telangiectasis and acts superior towards the minor gout patient Sir Aylmer. Mortimer arrives, despite Annabel's attempts to stop him, and tells Sir Aylmer that he must not allow his nephew to marry Annabel. Her late father had actually been a colonel in the Salvation Army, after being a Silver Ring bookmaker. Further, Mortimer introduces Uncle Joe, but Sir Aylmer is actually proud to meet him, since Joseph Boffin is famous for his ailments. Lord Rumbelow and his peers are also delighted to meet Joe. They congratulate Sir Aylmer on his nephew marrying the great Joseph Boffin's niece, and invite Sir Aylmer into their exclusive social club. Sir Aylmer signs Freddie's papers, and Freddie embraces Annabel. Mortimer, who has been absently doing magic tricks in the background, finally gives up and strides off. =\\"A Bit of Luck for Mabel\\"= * US: Saturday Evening Post, December 26, 1925 * UK: Strand, January 1926 ;Plot Ukridge and his pal Jimmy Corcoran are taking a break in the country, and one night Ukridge decides to tell the story of Mabel and the top hat. Ukridge had met Mabel at a dinner party at his Aunt Julia's house, and had fallen for her hard; she was the daughter of a wealthy colonial type who was busy out in Singapore, and Ukridge began frequenting their house. He has a rival for Mabel's love, who is a Baronet, which worries Ukridge somewhat, but he is given confidence by his dress, which, as he is at the time staying with his aunt, is rather dapper, top hat, spats and all. Ascot is approaching, and Ukridge agrees to attend with Mabel and her family. Aunt Julia discovers that Ukridge has pawned a clock from the spare room, to pay for gifts for Mabel, and kicks him out once more; Ukridge takes lodgings, but one day his hat is blown off and crushed in the street. Needing one for Ascot, he approaches George Tupper for a loan, but Tupper, annoyed at Ukridge for touching him twice in a week, proposes to find Ukridge a job, and fixes up a meeting with a friend of his who is after a secretary. Ukridge agrees, but on the way out picks up Tupper's topper. The day of the races arrives, and Ukridge gives his coat and hat to his landlady to clean up ready for the big event. She holds them to ransom, refusing to return them unless he pays the back-rent he owes. Desperate for apparel to attend the meet, he has a visitor, who he takes to be Tupper's friend come to interview him for the job; he tricks the man out of his coat and hat, which fit like a charm, and heads off to Ascot. Arriving, he meets Tupper, who tells him the friend had to cancel their appointment and had left for Paris the previous evening. Ukridge is bemused, until Mabel asks where her father is - he had, apparently, returned early from Singapore, and had been sent to collect Ukridge and bring him along to Ascot. Having thus embarrassed himself in front of her father, Ukridge gives Mabel up, and hears she later married the Bart. Ukridge suggests a weighty, moving title for the tale, something about fate and destiny, but Corky has something more fitting in mind. =\\"Buttercup Day\\"= * US: Saturday Evening Post, November 21, 1925 * UK: Strand, December 1925 ;Plot Ukridge, impoverished as ever, complains to his friend Corky of his lack of funds, and also of the way charity collectors take a heavy toll on what money he does get hold of. His Aunt Julia is holding a fete in the grounds of her house while she is away, and he asks Corky to help him guard the place from the revelers. Arriving at the Heath House, Corky is made to buy a paper flower from a pretty girl who informs him it is \\"Buttercup Day\\". Inside, Ukridge tells him it is all a plan of his - he has hired the girl, going in halves with her for the money she collects. Corky is shocked, but Ukridge explains that at no point is any real charity mentioned. With the money, suitably increased by some astute gambling, he plans to found a cat ranch in America. A stuttering curate enters, and complains about the Buttercup girl; Corky is heading off to warn her when he runs into Aunt Julia, returned early. He tries to shake her off, and returns to Ukridge, who he finds sleeping soundly; he meets Aunt Julia again, and a detective from Scotland Yard tells them that a dangerous crook is at the fete, a burglar known for his stuttering. He asks where Julia keeps her jewelry, and rushes off to check on it. Julia and Corky find they are locked in. Their shouts eventually bring Ukridge, who releases them, and it emerges that Ukridge had been drugged by the curate, while the butler had been locked in the cellar at gunpoint by the fake detective. Aunt Julia's jewels and collection of precious snuff boxes are missing. Ukridge is once again thrown out of his aunt's house, and is distraught to learn that his friend the Buttercup girl, having met a stuttering curate at the fete, had let him talk her into donating all her ill- gotten money to his church fund. =\\"Ukridge and the Old Stepper\\"= * UK: Strand, June 1928 * US: Liberty, June 9, 1928 ;Plot Ukridge and his friend Corky, the latter angry that Ukridge has stolen his best new suit, run into the titular Old Stepper in the street one day, and Corky is astounded to see Ukridge blank the fellow, despite his friendly greeting and offer of a free lunch. Ukridge explains how the chill fell on their relationship... Ukridge is sent by his Aunt Julia to her cottage in the country, mainly because her neighbour there is a successful man in the jute trade, and she hopes he may give Ukridge a job. Ukridge is sceptical, until he sees the man's daughter over his hedge and falls in love with her. Later, a stranger calls at the house, and introduces himself as Ukridge's \\"Uncle Percy\\" - having married Ukridge's stepmother's stepsister (hence the nickname \\"The Old Stepper\\") - freshly arrived from Australia. Ukridge takes him in, and is delighted to find him a generous fellow, filling the house with comfortable furniture and providing a summer house for the garden. The girl next door's birthday approaches, and Ukridge is in need of funds and ideas for her gift, until the Old Stepper suggests a sundial, which Ukridge agrees is a romantic thought. The man then goes and provides one, perfect for the job. With Ukridge well in the good books of his neighbours, he finally gets them to agree to come to tea one day, and his houseguest promises to fill the place with roses. The girl and her father arrive, and all is going swimmingly until a stranger calls at the house, claims that the furniture was paid for with a bad cheque, and begins to repossess it. Ukridge has just managed to calm his guests when another stranger, the girl's uncle and Ukridge's neighbour on the other side, appears. He has returned home to find his sundial at his brother's house, his roses all removed to Ukridge's parlour and his summer house in Ukridge's garden. The guests all leave in disgust. When the Old Stepper comes home, Ukridge berates him for his thieving ways. The old man tries to defend himself, claiming he has always \\"scrounged\\" things that were not in use, but ever since Ukridge has not trusted him, and has avoided him where possible, even at the cost of turning down a free meal. Background Wodehouse explained the inspiration for the short story \\"All's Well with Bingo\\" in a letter written on 12 August 1947 to a fan asking about the inspiration for his writing. Wodehouse responded that when planning a story, he usually decided on which character to incorporate first and then determined the plot, but one exception to this rule was \\"All's Well with Bingo\\", a story based on an experience of his own. As Wodehouse wrote in his letter: > I was in the Casino at Le Touquet one night, wandering about and > occasionally risking a small sum at one of the tables, and zero came up when > I was backing Black, and at the same moment I happened to get into > conversation with someone, and it was only some time later that I observed a > pile of counters on Black and realized that they were mine. My gratification > at scooping in the stuff was heightened by the immediate realization that I > had got the core of a story. Wodehouse also explained in the letter that he eventually chose Bingo Little and Mrs. Little for the story, and later incorporated the threatening bookmaker to make winning the money more important for Bingo.Wodehouse (2013), pp. 409-410. In the 1920s, Wodehouse visited the real English spa towns Harrogate and later Droitwich. He used background information from these visits when writing several short stories, most notably the short story \\"Romance at Droitgate Spa\\".Wodehouse (2013), P. G.

The compilation itself was the work of Leo, a Roman lawyer and principal counsellor of the king. The customs of the Visigothic nation were recognised and affirmed. The Code is largely confused and it appears that it was merely a recollection of Gothic custom altered by Roman law.Wolfram, Herwig. \\"The Goths in Aquitaine.\\" German Studies Review, Vol. 2, No. 2. (May 1979), pp 153-168. The code entrenches a clear stratification of Gothic and Gallo-Roman society. There is the class of lords, who are called either domini or patroni depending on whether they were lords of slaves or freemen. And there are two classes of freemen who have lords above them: the buccellarii and the saiones. The Code was in fact the first legal recognition of the buccellariatus, an office which the Roman Emperors were trying to ban. The buccellarii were a knightly class; they could change lords, but they had to return all the landed benefices they had received from their former lord. The Codex Euricianus contains, among other things, provisions governing border disputes and, in particular, issues arising from the division of land between the settled Gothic conquerors and the Romanesque landowners, as well as provisions for lending, purchase and donation, marriage and succession. He is acknowledged in research as a pioneering legislative achievement for the Germanic codifications. The work is written in good Latin; in his writing Roman lawyers must have had a significant share. Controversial is the proportion of Germanic and Roman legal concepts; It is undisputed that the proportion of Roman law dominates. In the first place, the legal texts derive from the classical law of the vulgar Paulussentenzen, which was written at the turn of the 3rd to the 4th century, and shortened excerpt from the Institutiones Gai as well as excerpts from the Constitutions of Roman Emperors. Jan Dirk Rake: Roman Law. From classical times to modern codifications . Beck, Munich 2008, ( Grundrisse the right ), § 1 Rnr. 26. Thus, the Codex Euricianus is also evidence of the advanced Romanization of the Visigoths.  Further legislation  Copy of Breviarium Alaricianum from University of Auvergne, France, 10th century Parts of the Codex Euricianus can be found later, probably as a base, in the Lex Baiuvariorum, the first Bavarian legislative codification. Also other Germanic legal codifications, those of the Burgundians (lex Romana Burgundionum) or Franks and Alamanni (lex Alamannorum), also are considered influenced by the Codex Euricianus. Hausmaninger, Herbert; Selb, Walter: Roman private law. Böhlau, Vienna 1981 (9th ed. 2001), , p. 50. After the death of Euric, the legislation remained in use and was even extended. The son of Euric, Alaric II added a piece of legislation known as the Breviary of Alaric (also known as Liber Aniani, after the supposed writer). These two laws together remained largely in force until the Visigoths settled definitively in Spain under King Liuvigild (568-586). This king adopted a new legislation, the Codex Revisius, but it was lost. Later, more extensive legislation was introduced, the Lex Romana Visigothorum. This legislation became a territorial legislation and no longer legislation that settled disputes between population groups, such as the Codex Euricianus.

Because pteridophytes produce neither flowers nor seeds, they are sometimes referred to as \\"cryptogams\\", meaning that their means of reproduction is hidden. Ferns, horsetails (often treated as ferns), and lycophytes (clubmosses, spikemosses, and quillworts) are all pteridophytes. However, they do not form a monophyletic group because ferns (and horsetails) are more closely related to seed plants than to lycophytes. \\"Pteridophyta\\" is thus no longer a widely accepted taxon, but the term pteridophyte remains in common parlance, as do pteridology and pteridologist as a science and its practitioner, respectively. Ferns and lycophytes share a life cycle and are often collectively treated or studied, for example by the International Association of Pteridologists and the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group. Description Pteridophytes (ferns and lycophytes) are free-sporing vascular plants that have a life cycle with alternating, free-living gametophyte and sporophyte phases that are independent at maturity. The body of the sporophyte is well differentiated into roots, stem and leaves. The root system is always adventitious. The stem is either underground or aerial. The leaves may be microphylls or megaphylls. Their other common characteristics include vascular plant apomorphies (e.g., vascular tissue) and land plant plesiomorphies (e.g., spore dispersal and the absence of seeds). Taxonomy Phylogeny = Of the pteridophytes, ferns account for nearly 90% of the extant diversity. Smith et al. (2006), the first higher-level pteridophyte classification published in the molecular phylogenetic era, considered the ferns as monilophytes, as follows: * Division Tracheophyta (tracheophytes) - vascular plants ** Subdivision Lycopodiophyta (lycophytes) - less than 1% of extant vascular plants ** Sub division Euphyllophytina (euphyllophytes) *** Infradivision Moniliformopses (monilophytes) *** Infradivision Spermatophyta - seed plants, ~260,000 species where the monilophytes comprise about 9,000 species, including horsetails (Equisetaceae), whisk ferns (Psilotaceae), and all eusporangiate and all leptosporangiate ferns. Historically both lycophytes and monilophytes were grouped together as pteridophytes (ferns and fern allies) on the basis of being spore-bearing (\\"seed-free\\"). In Smith's molecular phylogenetic study the ferns are characterised by lateral root origin in the endodermis, usually mesarch protoxylem in shoots, a pseudoendospore, plasmodial tapetum, and sperm cells with 30-1000 flagella. The term \\"moniliform\\" as in Moniliformopses and monilophytes means \\"bead-shaped\\" and was introduced by Kenrick and Crane (1997) as a scientific replacement for \\"fern\\" (including Equisetaceae) and became established by Pryer et al. (2004). Christenhusz and Chase (2014) in their review of classification schemes provide a critique of this usage, which they discouraged as irrational. In fact the alternative name Filicopsida was already in use. By comparison \\"lycopod\\" or lycophyte (club moss) means wolf-plant. The term \\"fern ally\\" included under Pteridophyta generally refers to vascular spore-bearing plants that are not ferns, including lycopods, horsetails, whisk ferns and water ferns (Marsileaceae, Salviniaceae and Ceratopteris), and even a much wider range of taxa. This is not a natural grouping but rather a convenient term for non-fern, and is also discouraged, as is eusporangiate for non- leptosporangiate ferns. However both Infradivision and Moniliformopses are also invalid names under the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. Ferns, despite forming a monophyletic clade, are formally only considered as four classes (Psilotopsida; Equisetopsida; Marattiopsida; Polypodiopsida), 11 orders and 37 families, without assigning a higher taxonomic rank. Furthermore, within the Polypodiopsida, the largest grouping, a number of informal clades were recognised, including leptosporangiates, core leptosporangiates, polypods (Polypodiales), and eupolypods (including Eupolypods I and Eupolypods II). In 2014 Christenhusz and Chase, summarising the known knowledge at that time, treated this group as two separate unrelated taxa in a consensus classification; * Lycopodiophyta (lycopods) 1 subclass, 3 orders, each with one family, 5 genera, approx. 1,300 species * Polypodiophyta (ferns) 4 sublasses, 11 orders, 21 families, approx. 212 genera, approx. 10,535 species ** Subclass Equisetidae Warm. ** Subclass Ophioglossidae Klinge ** Subclass Marattiidae Klinge ** Subclass Polypodiidae Cronquist, Takht. & Zimmerm. These subclasses correspond to Smith's four classes, with Ophioglossidae corresponding to Psilotopsida. The two major groups previously included in Pteridophyta are phylogenetically related as follows: = Subdivision = Pteridophytes consist of two separate but related classes, whose nomenclature has varied. The system put forward by the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group in 2016, PPG I, is: *Class Lycopodiopsida Bartl. – lycophytes: clubmosses, quillworts and spikemosses; 3 extant orders ::*Order Lycopodiales DC. ex Bercht. & J.Presl – clubmosses; 1 extant family ::*Order Isoetales Prantl – quillworts; 1 extant family ::*Order Selaginellales Prantl – spikemosses; 1 extant family *Class Polypodiopsida Cronquist, Takht. & W.Zimm. – horsetails and ferns; 11 extant orders **Subclass Equisetidae Warm. – horsetails; 1 extant order, family and genus (Equisetum) ***Order Equisetales DC. ex Bercht. & J.Presl – 1 extant family **Subclass Ophioglossidae Klinge – 2 extant orders ***Order Psilotales Prant – whisk ferns; 1 extant family ***Order Ophioglossales Link – grape ferns; 1 extant family **Subclass Marattiidae Klinge – marattioid ferns; 1 extant order ***Order Marattiales Link – 1 extant family **Subclass Polypodiidae Cronquist, Takht. & W.Zimm. – leptosporangiate ferns; 7 extant orders ***Order Osmundales Link – 1 extant family ***Order Hymenophyllales A.B.Frank – 1 extant family ***Order Gleicheniales Schimp – 3 extant families ***Order Schizaeales Schimp. – 3 extant families ***Order Salviniales Link – 2 extant families ***Order Cyatheales A.B.Frank – 8 extant families ***Order Polypodiales Link – 26 extant families In addition to these living groups, several groups of pteridophytes are now extinct and known only from fossils. These groups include the Rhyniopsida, Zosterophyllopsida, Trimerophytopsida, the Lepidodendrales and the Progymnospermopsida. Modern studies of the land plants agree that all pteridophytes share a common ancestor with seed plants. Therefore, pteridophytes do not form a clade but constitute a paraphyletic group. Ecology Pteridophyte life cycle Just as with bryophytes and spermatophytes (seed plants), the life cycle of pteridophytes involves alternation of generations. This means that a diploid generation (the sporophyte, which produces spores) is followed by a haploid generation (the gametophyte or prothallus, which produces gametes). Pteridophytes differ from bryophytes in that the sporophyte is branched and generally much larger and more conspicuous, and from seed plants in that both generations are independent and free-living. The sexuality of pteridophyte gametophytes can be classified as follows: * Dioicous: each individual gametophyte is either male (producing antheridia and hence sperm) or female (producing archegonia and hence egg cells). * Monoicous: each individual gametophyte produces both antheridia and archegonia and can function both as a male and as a female. *:Protandrous: the antheridia mature before the archegonia (male first, then female). *:Protogynous: the archegonia mature before the antheridia (female first, then male). These terms are not the same as monoecious and dioecious, which refer to whether a seed plant's sporophyte bears both male and female gametophytes, i. e., produces both pollen and seeds, or just one of the sexes.

It is commonly, but incorrectly, called \\"congo snake\\", \\"conger eel\\" or the \\"blind eel\\". Two-toed amphiumas are some of the largest extant amphibians in the world.  Description  Two-toed amphiumas can grow from in mass and from in length.Caudata Culture Species Entry – Amphiuma. Caudata.org. Retrieved on 2013-01-03.Deyle, Anna C. (2011) Population Genetics of Amphiuma means and Siren lacertina in Central Florida. M.S. Thesis, University of South Florida They have four vestigial legs that end in two toes; the number of toes is one of the primary differences between Amphiuma means and its relatives, the one-toed and three-toed amphiumas. The head is pointed and wedge-shaped, and the eyes are small. Adults retain a single gill slit on each side of the head. They are black, dark grey or dark brown in color.  Behavior  Two-toed amphiumas are nocturnal, and are often difficult to handle because of their slippery skins. They may leave water temporarily if weather is wet enough. They dig burrows in muddy stream bottoms, or may invade the burrows of other aquatic creatures. They are harmless to humans when left alone, but, when disturbed, they can deliver a tough bite, which may lead to a severe infection. Unlike other salamanders, which are mute, A. means gives a clear whistle when disturbed. = Reproduction = Amphiumas breed from June to July in North Carolina and northern Florida. Females lay about 200 eggs in a damp cavity beneath debris, close to standing water, and they remain coiled around them during incubation (which lasts around five months). Hatchlings are about long with three pairs of light-colored external gills soon lost after hatching. = Feeding = Two- toed amphiumas feed on small fish, tadpoles, crawfish, insects and insect larvae. They are also recorded to prey on reptiles and amphibians such as southern cricket frogs, southern leopard frogs, greater sirens, peninsula newts, water snakes of the genus Nerodia and small mud turtles. Their hunting behavior is not thoroughly understood, but they are believed to forage actively for food and to wait under debris and in burrows for prey to approach them. They likely detect prey through olfaction.  Habitat and range  Amphiumas live in areas of shallow, heavily vegetated water in swamps, bayous, lakes, and ponds, as well as wet prairies. Their range includes southeastern Virginia, eastern North Carolina, South Carolina, southern Georgia and Alabama, Florida, south Mississippi, Louisiana, and southeastern Texas.

The film stars Hitomi Kuroki, Rio Kanno, Mirei Oguchi, Asami Mizukawa, Fumiyo Kohinata, Yu Tokui, Isao Yatsu and Shigemitsu Ogi. The plot follows a divorced mother who moves into a rundown apartment with her daughter, and experiences supernatural occurrences including a mysterious water leak from the floor above. An American-produced remake of the film, directed by Walter Salles and starring Jennifer Connelly and Tim Roth, was released in 2005.  Plot  Yoshimi Matsubara, in the midst of a divorce mediation, rents a run-down apartment with her daughter, Ikuko. She enrolls Ikuko in a nearby kindergarten and gets a job as a proofreader in a small publishing company. The ceiling of their apartment has a leak that worsens on a daily basis. Matsubara complains to the building superintendent but he does nothing to fix it. When she tries to contact the apartment above, she gets no answer. Strange events recur: a red bag reappears no matter how often Yoshimi tries to dispose of it. Hair is found in tap water. Yoshimi gets glimpses of a mysterious long-haired girl around the complex. She becomes regularly late in picking up Ikuko from school and is stressed further when her ex-husband tries to take Ikuko. Several incidents remind her of the time she was abandoned as a child. When Ikuko sees the long-haired girl in a yellow raincoat, she becomes ill. Yoshimi discovers a flyer for a missing girl named Mitsuko Kawai, who had attended the same kindergarten as Ikuko but disappeared about a year ago. Mitsuko had worn a yellow raincoat and carried a red bag. Yoshimi discovers the apartment upstairs is Mitsuko's former apartment. One day, Yoshimi finds Ikuko in the apartment upstairs, discovering that the faucets have been left running and have flooded the entire unit. Yoshimi decides to move out, but her lawyer convinces her that moving now would weaken her position in gaining custody of Ikuko. Her lawyer talks to the superintendent, who finally agrees to fix the issue. After the ceiling is patched, things seemingly return to normal. But Yoshimi finds that the red bag has reappeared. She heads to the building roof and notices that the water tank was last inspected – and thus opened – over a year ago: the same day Mitsuko was last reported seen. She comes to the horrific realization via a vision that Mitsuko had fallen into the tank while trying to retrieve her red bag and drowned. Meanwhile, her ghost attempts to drown Ikuko in the bathtub. Yoshimi finds Ikuko unconscious. She grabs her and rushes into the elevator, fleeing from Mitsuko. But as the elevator door closes, she sees that the figure pursuing her is in fact her own daughter – she is actually carrying Mitsuko. Mitsuko claims Yoshimi as her mother in a torrent of water and Yoshimi realizes that she won't let her go. With Ikuko watching tearfully, Yoshimi sacrifices herself by staying in the elevator to appease Mitsuko's spirit. Ikuko rushes to the floor the elevator stops but when the doors open, a flood of brown water rushes out and nobody emerges. Ten years later, Ikuko, now in high school, revisits the now- abandoned block and notices that her old apartment looks oddly clean and lived-in. She then sees her mother, looking exactly as she did that fateful night, and they have a conversation. Yoshimi affirms that as long as Ikuko is all right, she is happy. Ikuko pleads to live with her mother but she apologizes that they cannot be together. Mitsuko appears behind Ikuko. Ikuko turns but sees no one. When she turns back around, Yoshimi has also disappeared. Ikuko realizes that her mother's spirit has been watching over her.

Reception On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Dark Water has an approval rating of 80% (based on 15 critics) and a weighted average of 6.83 out of 10. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, writing that \\"The movie's denouement delivers not just a flash of fear but a strange, sweet charge of pathos - and the combination adds up to the most disturbing spell in the cinema I've had in a very long time\\". Alexander Walker of the London Evening Standard also gave the film a positive review, writing that \\"Its cleverness relies on transferring our concern from the supernatural events emanating from one lost child to the natural fear of a mother losing her own child to the other world.\\" Katie Rife of The A.V. Club recommended the film for horror fans, writing that \\"The J-horror boom of the '90s and early '00s produced some extremely creepy ghost stories, and Dark Water ... is one of the creepiest, and saddest, of them all.\\" Thomas Spurlin of DVD Talk gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars, writing that it \\"doesn't pack as much of a suspenseful punch as other entries in the J-Horror subgenre, but the heaviness of its supernatural moisture-soaked atmosphere and the melancholy angle of its parental theatrics fill that void\\". Nicholas Rucka of Midnight Eye called the film \\"a simply passable horror viewing experience\\", criticizing its \\"weak story resolve and mediocre characterization\\" but writing that it \\"is worth watching for a good chill.\\" Related work The original title, Honogurai Mizu no Soko kara (仄暗い水の底から, From the Depths of Dark Water), is also the title of the horror anthology by Koji Suzuki and the manga adaptation, authored by Koji Suzuki and illustrated by MEIMU, under Kadokawa Shoten in 2002.

It is also known as \\"Johnny Riley\\", \\"The Broken Token\\" and \\"A Fair Young Maid All in Her Garden\\", among other titles. Background The song is derived from Homer's Odyssey, interpreted through the 17th century English folk ballad tradition, and tells the story of a prospective suitor who asks a woman if she will marry him. She replies that she cannot because she is betrothed to John Riley, who has gone away over the seas. The man persists, asking her whether Riley is worth waiting for and suggesting that he may have drowned, been killed in war, or married another woman. She steadfastly maintains that she will continue to wait for Riley, regardless of his possible fate. In the last stanza, the suitor reveals that he is in fact John Riley, returned from the seas, and has been testing his beloved. The song's theme, that of the \\"disguised true lover\\", has long been a theme in traditional folk ballads and several variations of this song exist.

The player attempts to destroy the robots by moving in such a way that the robots collide with each other or other obstacles. The basic concept has been part of games stretching into the 1970s, as is among the earliest of the \\"standards\\" for microcomputer platforms. Many variations exist, the most notable being the home computer- based Escape! and Zombies, Daleks on MacOS and robots on Unix. The original author of the game remains unknown, but it is highly likely it started on the DTSS system at Dartmouth College in the early 1970s. The first public versions appeared in Creative Computing magazine in early 1976 and a variety of modified versions appeared over the next few years. Daleks and robots both appeared in 1984, leading to another wave of similar versions. New ports continue to appear to this day. Gameplay BSD robots is very similar to the original Chase. Chase is played on a two-dimensional rectangular grid. The objective of the game is to escape from a number of robots, which have been programmed to kill the player. The game is turn-based. In the original game, the player character starts at a randomly selected location. In some derivative versions, such as the GNOME version, the player starts at the centre of the grid. The robots start at randomly selected locations on the grid. Every time the player character moves a square in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), each robot moves one square closer to their new location, in whichever direction is the shortest path. If the player character collides with a robot, they die and the game ends. The player attempts to survive by causing the robots to kill themselves by colliding with other objects on the map. There are two major ways this occurs. In earlier versions derived from Chase!, there are a number of deadly objects on the map that will kill either the robots or the player. In later versions derived from robots, the map is initially clear and these hazards are created when two robots collide to create a pile of rubble. In either case, the player is attempting to move in such a way to cause the robots to collide with each other or stationary obstacles. The player can also teleport into a randomly selected location in cases where escape is otherwise impossible. Teleportation counts as a move, and the robots will respond by moving towards the new location. Because the location is randomly selected, it is possible that the player teleports right into the path of a robot. In some versions of the game, there is a \\"safe teleport\\" feature which the player may use a limited number of times (for instance once per level) and there may also be a close-range weapon which kills all robots within the immediate vicinity, the use of which would be limited in a similar way. A few versions also add a tank, which is not killed when colliding with the other objects and is deadly to all objects. It otherwise acts like the other robots. The game is won when all of the robots are destroyed. In modern versions, this normally results in the game proceeding to another level with more robots. Traditionally, the number of robots increases by ten each level. Other versions GNOME robots replaces the character graphics with sprites. Chase was originally written in Dartmouth BASIC on the DTSS system at Dartmouth College. The original author is unknown, and original versions of the source code have not been found. The Jan-Feb 1976 issue of Creative Computing contains a version of this original code ported to the Honeywell 6000 series by Bill Cotter. It was republished in 1979's More BASIC Computer Games, at that time adding a note suggesting the original author was Mac Oglesby,Chase (additional detail from 1979) a prolific game author of Dartmouth BASIC games from the mainframe era. A series of relatively direct copies of this game appeared in computer magazines of the era, including one for the SWCP 4k BASIC, and a graphical version using the VDM-1 card for S-100 bus machines. It was also ported to the PLATO system's TUTOR language on the MODCOMP IV as HiVolts. Many follow-up versions of the game were known as Escape!, although it is not clear when this name was first used. One such version appears in Announcing: Computer Games for the TRS-80, which added another enemy, the tank, and limited the player to two teleports per match. A commercial graphical version of Escape! was also sold by subLOGIC as early as 1982, which added a real-time option that caused the robots to move even if the user didn't. A review of this version in Creative Computing once again attributed the original to Mac Oglesby. A modified version of Escape! known as Robot Minefield was released in 1983 by Tim Hartnell and Nathan Butcher. This reduced the number of enemies to four and eliminated the tank. In addition, the player could only move in four directions (North, South, East, West) while the robots had the ability to move diagonally. The game was played in real time; as the player pondered his move, the robots would continue converging toward him. This version was published in the 1983 Giant Book of Computer Games.GameBase64: Robot MinefieldTim Hartnell's Giant Book of Computer Games, p.273: Robot Minefield The Unix-based robots was developed by Allan R.

Bachmann was convicted of the attack and sentenced to seven years in prison. He committed suicide in 1970 while serving his sentence.  Early life  Bachmann was born on 12 October 1944 and grew up in East Germany in a family situation that had been described as difficult. In 1956, he left the GDR with his mother for West Germany and settled in Peine, Lower Saxony. Considered a poor student, he began to finance his lifestyle with a series of break-ins. He moved around frequently and changed jobs multiple times. In 1966 he was convicted for break-ins he committed in France. In 1968 he moved to Munich, searching for work. While in Munich, he had heard of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.. This inspired him to assassinate Dutschke, whom he disliked for \\"being a communist\\". In 2009 it emerged that Bachmann had contact with an active cell of Neonazis in Peine starting in 1961 and that he participated in shooting practice with them. Attack Bachmann left his place of work in Munich on 10 April 1968 and travelled by train to Berlin. On his departure he told his fellow workers that they would hear about him in the media soon. On the afternoon of 11 April, Bachmann approached the residence of Dutschke on Kurfürstendamm 140. Seeing Dutschke leaving the building at around 4:35pm, Bachmann approached him, inquiring if he was Rudi Dutschke. On Dutschke's confirmation, Bachmann pulled his gun and shot him with three bullets, calling him a \\"dirty communist pig\\". Bachmann fled the scene, leaving the seriously injured Dutschke behind. Bachmann went into hiding in a nearby basement, where police tracked him down. Following a shoot-out with police he was arrested. Prior to his arrest, Bachmann attempted to kill himself with sleeping pills. He was taken to a hospital to deal with the poisoning.  Aftermath  Bachmann confessed to the assassination attempt and was convicted and sentenced to seven years in prison in 1969. In the attempt on his life, Dutschke suffered brain damage and had to learn to speak again. Being aware that Bachmann had attempted to kill himself, Dutschke started to converse with Bachmann in a series of letters. In this exchange, Dutschke considered suicide as cowardly. Bachmann apologised for what he had done to Dutschke. In the night of 23-24 February 1970, Bachmann committed suicide by suffocating himself with a plastic bag. In media Bachmann was portrayed by Tom Schilling in the 2008 film Der Baader Meinhof Komplex.

These most often include major weight gain, altered hormone levels, morning nausea, and disturbed sleep patterns. In more extreme cases, symptoms can include labor pains, fatigue, postpartum depression, and nosebleeds. The labor pain symptom is commonly known as sympathy pain. Couvade syndrome is not recognized as a real syndrome by many medical professionals. Its source is a matter of debate. Some believe it to be a psychosomatic condition, while others believe it may have biological causes relating to hormone changes. The name derives from \\"couvade\\", a class of male pregnancy rituals. Symptoms Symptoms experienced by the partner can include stomach pain, back pain, indigestion, changes in appetite, weight gain, acne, diarrhea, constipation, headache, toothache, cravings, nausea, breast augmentation, breast growth, dry navel, hardening of the nipple, excessive earwax, and insomnia. A qualitative study listed 35 symptoms from Couvade literature, including gastrointestinal, genitourinary, respiratory, oral or dental, stiffening of the glutes, generalized aches and pains, and other symptoms. Psychological theories Psychological causes suggested have included anxiety, pseudo-sibling rivalry, identification with the fetus, ambivalence about fatherhood, or parturition envy. According to Osvlosky and Culp (1989), pregnancy causes the male counterpart to experience an emergence of ambivalence as well as a recurrence of Oedipal conflict. In 1920s France, Couvade was claimed to be more common in conditions where sex roles are flexible and the female is of a dominant status. Physiological theories Studies have shown that the male partner cohabitating with a pregnant female will experience hormonal shifts in his prolactin, cortisol, estradiol, and testosterone levels, typically starting at the end of the first trimester and continuing through several weeks post-partum.

Life Of the family of the counts of Saarbrücken, he served as imperial chancellor under Emperors Henry IV and Henry V. In 1110 he was sent to Rome as part of an embassy to arrange for Henry V's coronation as emperor. In exchange for supporting the Emperor in his quest to regain the rights to investiture (which Henry received from Pope Paschal II in 1111), he was given the position of archbishop of Mainz. Following this, however, Adalbert turned against the Emperor, due to personal dislikes as well as territorial ambitions. Henry ended up imprisoning Adalbert for three years (1112-1115) without trial after the archbishop refused to hand over control of the imperial castles. Market portal of Mainz cathedral. The liberty privilege for the Mainz citizens is engraved on the bronze wings. Following his release, caused by a revolt by the people of Mainz, he actively worked against the Emperor, using the latter's excommunication as a pretext. Strong papal campaigning had meanwhile turned much of the German clergy against the Emperor, and Adalbert soon became the leader of the anti-Imperialist bishops. When Henry left for Italy in 1116, Adalbert raised much of the country against the Emperor, and the conflict continued. After Pope Calixtus II gained power in 1119, he made the archbishop a papal legate, following which Henry attacked Mainz. In response, Adalbert convinced the Saxon nobility to revolt. Negotiations between the two sides after they met for battle resulted in a temporary truce. The conflict between the two was suspended indefinitely following the Concordat of Worms in 1122, where the Emperor surrendered investiture. Adalbert did not forget his hatred of Henry, however. Upon the latter's death in 1125, he saw a golden opportunity. The archbishop felt that the German monarchy was much too powerful and needed to be weakened, starting with the elimination of hereditary succession. In the past, the elections for the Salian kings had been more of a mere stamp of approval for the living Emperors' sons than an actual election to determine who would become king. In this case, Henry's nephew, Frederick II, Duke of Swabia stood as the obvious choice. However, after gaining the imperial insignia, the archbishop sabotaged Frederick's rise to the kingship. Adalbert convinced the nobility that hereditary monarchy was not in their best interests, and persuaded them to instead choose the relatively weak candidate Duke Lothar of Saxony, who became Lothar III. The election was thus important in that the nobility could no longer be guaranteed to vote for a king's designated heir, which forced later kings to give even greater concessions than ever before in return for a promise to elect their sons. Adalbert died in 1137 and was buried in a chapel of Mainz Cathedral. Sources * Karl Hampe (1973).

Only one of them – the state of Vermont – succeeded. Among the unsuccessful ones, the most prominent included the proposed state of Long Island, consisting of everything on the island outside New York City; a state called Niagara, the western counties of New York state; the northern counties of New York state called Upstate New York; making the city of New York a state; a proposal for a new Peconic County on eastern Long Island; and for the borough of Staten Island to secede from New York City. Article 4, Section 3 of the Constitution of the United States includes a provision that \\"no new State shall be formed or erected within the Jurisdiction of any other State; nor any State be formed by the Junction of two or more States, or Parts of States, without the Consent of the Legislatures of the States concerned as well as of the Congress.\\" At the time of Vermont's secession in 1777, the Constitution of the United States did not yet exist. By the time Congress recognized Vermont and admitted it to the Union in 1791, the Constitution was in effect and the legislature of New York had consented. All later secession proposals would require similar consent. History Proposed map of an independent New York City. Tensions between what eventually became upstate and downstate New York had existed since Leisler's Rebellion in 1689. That rebellion was more heavily supported in the lower Hudson Valley, near modern New York City, than it was in the Albany area, which remained loyal to the English crown (at the time, the Glorious Revolution was underway in England). Although the rebellion was settled in 1691 when Leisler was executed, tensions between the upper and lower Hudson Valley remained high for another two decades afterward. =Vermont, 1777= The only successful secession from the state of New York was that of Vermont in 1777, and whether that amounted to secession depends on the validity of New York's always disputed claim to Vermont. After Vermont had been governed for fifteen years as a de facto part of New Hampshire, King George III had ruled on July 20, 1764 that the disputed territory belonged to New York and not to New Hampshire. The disputed territory later became the state of Vermont. The government of New York refused to recognize the property rights of homesteaders who had settled there under the laws of New Hampshire from 1749 to 1764. Armed militias, formed by settlers in the region (most prominently the Green Mountain Boys) prevented the government of New York from evicting settlers from their land and largely prevented New York from governing at all. Sovereignty also continued to be relatively passively asserted by New Hampshire until 1782. After the United States Declaration of Independence, the people of the New Hampshire Grants (as the region was then called) could no longer hope for redress from the courts of England. Consequently, they issued the Vermont Declaration of Independence in January 1777, including a long list of grievances against the government of New York. For 14 years after that, Vermont functioned as a de facto independent country. The question of recognizing it and admitting it to the Union was occasionally discussed in the Continental Congress, but New York's representatives successfully opposed it. On March 2, 1784, New York's governor, George Clinton, asked Congress to declare war on Vermont, the object being to overthrow Vermont's government and reincorporate Vermont into New York, but Congress did not act, and some members proposed recognizing Vermont and offering it admission to the Union.Mello, Robert, Moses Robinson and the Founding of Vermont, Vermont Historical Society, 2014. On March 6, 1790, the legislature of New York expressed its consent to the admission to the Union of what they called \\"the community now actually exercising independent jurisdiction as 'the State of Vermont'\\", provided an agreement on the boundary between the two states could be reached. In the ensuing negotiations, Vermont's commissioners insisted on also settling the numerous real-estate disputes arising from conflicting land grants from New York, New Hampshire, and Vermont, rather than leaving those to be decided in a federal court.Mello, Robert (2014), p. 260. On October 7, 1790, the commissioners proclaimed the negotiations concluded. In January 1791, a convention called by the state of Vermont ratified the Constitution of the United States, declaring that it would be part of the law of Vermont as soon as Congress admitted that state. On February 18, 1791, Congress decided to admit Vermont to the Union two weeks later on March 4. =Post-Revolution era= In the battle over the ratification of the United States Constitution in 1787–1788, Governor George Clinton in Albany, wishing to preserve his power, led the local Anti-Federalists in opposition, with support for the Constitution coming from Alexander Hamilton and the Federalists, who were largely urbanites and saw opportunity in a stronger national union and published The Federalist Papers as their manifesto in several New York City newspapers, including The Independent Journal. There was a large divide, and with the recent independence of Vermont, a threat of secession of New York City and the southern counties to join the new Federal government. The leaders of Richmond County, which maintained an ambiguous position, threatened to join New Jersey. With secession threatening to marginalize Governor Clinton and a lightly developed upstate, the Constitution was ratified and the crisis passed. At the time, much of what is now upstate New York, particularly Western New York was disputed and unsettled frontier territory, with Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Connecticut claiming portions of the mostly undeveloped land. This frontier land was not included in the Northwest Ordinance, but it was not until the Phelps and Gorham Purchase and the Holland Purchase that it became New York territory. =Civil War era= In the period of national crisis immediately preceding the American Civil War, Democratic Mayor Fernando Wood proposed the secession of New York City as a sovereign city-state to be called the Free City of Tri-Insula (Tri-Insula meaning \\"three islands\\" in Latin), and incorporating Manhattan, Long Island and Staten Island. In an address to the city's Common Council on January 6, 1861, Mayor Wood expressed a Copperhead sympathy with the seceding states and a desire to maintain profitable cotton shipping, confidence that the city-state would prosper on the import tariffs that then supplied 2/3 of federal revenue, and especially dissatisfaction with the state government at Albany. But the idea of leaving the United States proved too radical even in the turmoil of 1861 and was poorly received, especially after the Southern bombardment of Fort Sumter starting on April 12. The war, and especially conscription, was nevertheless often unpopular in the city, sparking the deadly New York Draft Riots. The neighboring City of Brooklyn, in contrast, was staunchly Unionist. Coincidentally, the upstate locale of Town Line, New York voted to secede from the Union, contributing five soldiers to the Confederate troops. (Twenty residents fought for the Union Army.) Since Town Line was an unincorporated community with no legal status, the secession vote had no legal effect, and the Confederacy never recognized it.Federal Writers' Project, New York: A Guide to the Empire State (1940) p. 436. Town Line ceremonially \\"rejoined\\" the Union in 1946; its residents paid taxes during its time \\"out of the union,\\" which amounted to 85 years.Tucker, John (January 18, 2011). New York town that belonged to the Confederate States of America. . WGRZ. Retrieved 2011-04-01. =1969= In 1969, writer Norman Mailer and columnist Jimmy Breslin ran together on an independent ticket seeking the mayoralty and City Council Presidency, challenging Mayor John Lindsay with an agenda to make New York City the 51st state. When questioned as to the name of the new state, Breslin said the city deserved to keep \\"New York\\" and that upstate should be renamed \\"Buffalo\\", after its largest city. =2000s= A 51-star flag. On February 26, 2003, a bill was introduced by Astoria, Queens Council Member Peter Vallone, Jr., and sponsored by 20 of 51 City Council members, reviving the idea of referendum for secession from New York State in the context of the red state vs. blue state divide and opposition to the policies of Governor George Pataki. A committee report was written but otherwise little action was taken, and the bill was reintroduced with one additional sponsor on the same date in 2004. Like Mayor Wood, Council Member Vallone emphasized the fiscal benefits of secession, with revenue now derived not from tariffs, but from Wall Street. Council Member Vallone reintroduced the bill in 2006. In January 2008, Vallone again offered a bill for the secession of New York City from New York state. After Mayor Michael Bloomberg testified to New York state legislators that New York City gives the state $11 billion more than it gets back, Vallone stated: \\"If not secession, somebody please tell me what other options we have if the state is going to continue to take billions from us and give us back pennies? Should we raise taxes some more? Should we cut services some more? Or should we consider seriously going out on our own?\\" The New York City council planned to hold a meeting on the topic.Benjamin Sarlin, A Secession Plan Is Floated for New York City, New York Sun, January 30, 2008. =2010s= In 2015, fifteen towns in Sullivan, Delaware, Broome, and Tioga counties were reported to be looking into seceding from the State of New York and joining the state of Pennsylvania. One reason given for the movement was Governor Andrew Cuomo's move to ban hydraulic fracturing, which is legal in Pennsylvania. Concurrently, groups of state legislators from Long Island and upstate New York introduced legislation to gauge support for partitioning the state; the bills were introduced shortly after Sheldon Silver, who had served as Speaker of the New York State Assembly for two decades and was an ardent opponent of such a partition, was deposed from his post as part of a federal investigation.McCarthy, Jimmy (February 21, 2015).

Long Island secession On Long Island, there also have been calls for Nassau and Suffolk Counties to separate from New York State. Former Suffolk County comptroller and former state assemblyman Joseph Sawicki (a Republican) called for a separation of Long Island from the rest of the state, saying that the region, one of the wealthiest in the state, receives only $5.2 billion in state payments and pays $8.1 billion in taxes. Nassau County executive Ed Mangano came out in support of such a proposal in April 2010 and commissioned a study on it.Casesse, Sid and William Murphy (May 1, 2010). Nassau Executive Magnano Supports Long Island as 51st State. Newsday. Retrieved 2010-05-01. Long Island also had a movement pushing for secession of the entire geographic island (Kings, Queens, Nassau, and Suffolk counties) from the state of New York. Upstate secession Areas in Western New York and the Southern Tier, such as those in this map in the contiguous red area (the red areas illustrate the counties that voted for Carl Paladino in the 2010 New York gubernatorial election), have seen the most support for an independent upstate. A parallel Upstate New York statehood movement seeks separation due to taxation and economic concerns.\\"The Big City; The Moochers From Upstate? Cut 'Em Loose\\", John Tierney, The New York Times, May 24, 1999. Such proposals often include excising Albany (and presumably the Hudson River Valley) along with New York City, due to a perception that Albany is primarily controlled by politicians from the New York City area.

Due to an oversight or perhaps to foster competition, two Kings of England (Charles I and Charles II) awarded the same upstate New York territory as part of sea-to-sea grants to Massachusetts Bay Colony and New York Colony respectively; Pennsylvania Colony also separately laid claim to much of the territory now in the Southern Tier up until 1774. It was not until 1786, with the Treaty of Hartford, that the dispute was settled; New York got territorial rights, but Massachusetts got to sell the land to developers. In 1792, a portion encompassing modern-day Erie, Pennsylvania (given to New York in the treaty) was sold to Pennsylvania. The Niagara Frontier, which had been explored by and part of French Canada, served as the western front of the Revolutionary War and (as British territory) the War of 1812, and did not fall securely into American sovereignty until the end of that war. An upper portion of the Province of New York seceded: the northeastern corner of the province became self-governing in 1777 during the American Revolution, and it was granted statehood in its own right as Vermont in 1791. It was the first state in the union which had not been a separate British colony. Support for a separation from within upstate surged in the second half of the 20th century, possibly due in part to several U.S. Supreme Court rulings (see Baker v. Carr and Reynolds v. Sims) that established a mandate of one man, one vote in all state legislatures. The rulings gave New York City significant legislative advantages over upstate, which coincidentally entered a prolonged economic and population decline at around the same time. Former State Senator and U.S. Congressman Randy Kuhl, from rural upstate Hammondsport, advocated splitting the state into \\"New York\\" and \\"West New York\\" and introduced several bills to that effect during his time in the state senate. State senators Joseph Robach, Dale Volker, and Michael Ranzenhofer, Republicans from Western New York, proposed a nonbinding referendum to gauge support for dividing the state in November 2009.Terreri, Jill (November 28, 2009).

Republican Assemblyman Stephen Hawley introduced a bill in February 2013 to give each county an opportunity to provide feedback on potential partition of the state.

Intrastate secession proposalsPeconic County secession from Suffolk County= A map showing the proposed location of Peconic County. Peconic County is a proposed new county in New York that would secede the five easternmost towns of Suffolk County: East Hampton, Riverhead, Shelter Island, Southampton and Southold, plus the Shinnecock Indian Reservation. 71 percent of the east end voters in 1997 approved a nonbinding resolution to secede. However, the New York State Assembly did not approve the enabling legislation. East End newspapers speculated that the Assembly was afraid it would encourage a tidal wave of secessions in the state including Staten Island seceding from New York CityVoters Vs. Politicians On Peconic County – East Hampton Star – March 5, 1998 and perhaps even causing the division of upstate and downstate New York. This move to secede fell dormant in 1998. =Staten Island secession from New York City= The \\"Greater City\\" exists as a result of actions of the New York State Legislature, and, as such, could be reduced in size by the same mechanism. A non-binding referendum in the borough of Staten Island was held in 1993 to consider whether it should be allowed to secede from the City. The New York City government and Mayor David Dinkins opposed the vote, contending that the referendum should not be permitted by the state unless the city issued a home rule message supporting it, which the city would not. Governor Mario Cuomo disagreed, and the vote went forward. Ultimately, 65% of Staten Island residents voted to secede, through the approval of a new city charter making Staten Island an independent city, but implementation was blocked in the State Assembly. The Staten Island secession movement was defused by the election of Rudy Giuliani as New York City mayor on the same ballot. He had campaigned on the promise that Staten Island's grievances would be addressed. Giuliani's plurality in his narrow victory over Dinkins was aided by overwhelming support from Staten Island. Two of the borough's biggest demands were closing the Fresh Kills Landfill and making the Staten Island Ferry free, both of which were done. However, after the election of Bill de Blasio as Mayor in 2013 and the success of the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom in 2016, interest in secession was revived. In 2019, New York City councilman Joe Borelli announced his plan to introduce another set of bills to study the feasibility of secession. In December 2019, Michael Reilly, a Republican assemblyman from Staten Island, expressed interest in joining upstate in the event it broke off from New York City.O'Brien, Rachel (December 7, 2019).

Biography Curtis was born in Norwich and learned his engraving skills in the workshop of his father, Charles Morgan Curtis. Charles Curtis died young and his widow, Frances, became a flower grower.She encouraged her son to study natural history with a local naturalist, Richard Walker (1791–1870). At the age of 16 he became an apprentice at a local lawyer's office in Norwich but devoted his spare time to studying and drawing insects and, with insect collecting becoming a growing craze, he found he could make a living selling the specimens he found. At this time he became a friend of Simon Wilkin (1790–1862), finally leaving his job and living with Wilkin at Costessey where he undertook systematic insect studies. Through Wilkin he met the entomologists William Kirby and William Spence and his illustrations were published in An Introduction to Entomology (1815–1826). Sometime between 1817 and 1819 Curtis moved to London, meeting Sir Joseph Banks, president of the Royal Society. Banks introduced him to William Elford Leach a curator at the British Museum. He studied conchology with Leach. Through Leach he met James Charles Dale who became his patron.He also worked in Paris with Pierre André Latreille. In 1824 he began his greatest achievement, British Entomology: Being Illustrations and Descriptions of the Genera of Insects Found in Great Britain and Ireland, widely considered one of the finest works on the subject of the nineteenth century. It was published in monthly parts by subscription from 1824 to 1839, each part comprising 3 or more plates with descriptive texts ranging from usually 2 to as many as 10 pages. The finished work comprised 16 volumes each of 12 parts, 192 parts in all together with 770 plates (1 to 769 plus 205*), available either coloured or plain. Georges Cuvier (1769–1832) described British Entomology as \\"the paragon of perfection\\". By 1840 Curtis began to suffer with poor eyesight which worsened in later life causing him financial problems.These were partly solved by publishing a number of entomological articles in the Gardener's Chronicle, as \\"Ruricola\\", and in the Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society. This led to the profitable Farm Insects: Being the Natural History and Economy of the Insects Injurious to the Field Crops of Great Britain and Ireland published in 1860. By the end of 1856 Curtis was totally blind and receiving a civil list pension initially of £100 a year but later increased to £150. Many years after his death, when the original drawings for British Entomology were up for sale, there were fears that the precious collection would be split up. The whole collection was, however, purchased by Walter Rothschild and later bequeathed to the Natural History Museum, where they remain today. He was a Fellow of the Linnean Society of London from 1822, in 1833. He lent support to the founding of what became the Royal Entomological Society and served as its president from 1855 to 1857. He was an honorary member of the Société entomologique de France. Contacts Curtis was a lifelong friend of the Irish entomologist Alexander Henry Haliday and of the London entomologist Francis Walker.

It pitted the young and newly enthroned Jiajing Emperor against the Grand Secretary Yang Tinghe and the majority of the Confucian officials in his government. The Jiajing Emperor had succeeded his first cousin, the Zhengde Emperor after the latter died childless. His uncle, the Hongzhi Emperor, had not left any other surviving children either. In order to perform the proper rituals owed him according to tradition, it was necessary that the Jiajing Emperor be posthumously adopted by his late uncle who has been dead for nearly two decades. The Jiajing Emperor was reluctant to do this partly because he feared the influence of the Hongzhi Emperor's surviving wife, Empress Dowager Zhang. In this he had the support of his biological mother, who was angered by the prospect that her son could be removed from her by adoption.Adler, Joseph. \\"The Confucian Body \\". China Review Intl., Vol. 10, No. 2 (2003). The conflict between the emperor backed by his mother and officialdom backed by the empress dowager was finally broken by memorials to the throne (namely, by newly qualified scholar-bureaucrats Zhang Cong and Gui E) arguing that rituals performed contrary to the emperor's own heart would be against human nature. Encouraged by this, gradually Emperor Jiajing fostered the idea of \\"ascending the clan but not the lineage\\" and grew more presumptuous. The core counter- argument to Emperor Jiajing's claim, supported by a large majority of court officials, had to do with the imperial treatment of the Zhengde Emperor and his widow Empress Xia. The couple together had passed the throne to their cousin instead of an adopted child of their own, in favor of their mother-in- law. As a matter of fact, Emperor Jiajing's grandfather Emperor Chenghua had other great-grandsons and this was brought up in the discussion of royal succession with the empress dowager, prior to summoning Emperor Jiajing to Beijing in her name. Emperor Jiajing decided to allow his own father Zhu Youyuan, the late Prince Xian of Xing, to be posthumously elevated to the status of emperor and particularly be granted seniority over Zhengde Emperor, who was the late prince's sovereign during his life. Prime Minister Yang Tinghe was forced into retirement; his son Yang Shen who led the counter- argumentLeonard, Andrew. \\"Invasion of the Great Green Algae Monster .

He is IG Patel Professor of Economics and Government and Chair of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics (LSE), and 2010 Professor of Collège de France. From 2013–2017, he was President of the British Academy.  Education  After attending Latymer Upper School, Stern studied the Mathematical Tripos and was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree in maths at Peterhouse, Cambridge in 1967.https://www.pet.cam.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Winter_07_enews.pdf His doctorate in economics (DPhilEcon) at Nuffield College, Oxford, with thesis on the rate of economic development and the theory of optimum planning in 1971 was supervised by James Mirrlees, 1996's Nobel Prize in Economics winner.  Career and research  1970–2007 = He was a lecturer at University of Oxford from 1970–1977 and served as a Professor of Economics at the University of Warwick from 1978 to 1987. He taught from 1986 to 1993 at the London School of Economics, becoming the Sir John Hicks Professor of Economics. From 1994 until 1999 he was the Chief Economist and Special Counsellor to the President of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. His research focused on economic development and growth, and he also wrote books on Kenya and the Green Revolution in India. Since 1999, he has been a member of the International Advisory Council of the Center for Social and Economic Research (CASE). From 1999 until 2000 Stern was Chairman of the consultancy London Economics founded by John Kay. He was the Chief Economist and Senior Vice-President of the World Bank from 2000 to 2003. Stern was then recruited by Gordon Brown, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, to work for the British government where, in 2003, he became second permanent secretary at HM Treasury, initially with responsibility for public finances, and head of the Government Economic Service. Having also been Director of Policy and Research for the Commission for Africa, he was, in July 2005, appointed to conduct reviews on the economics of climate change and also of development, which led to the publication of the Stern Review. At the time, he ceased to be a second permanent secretary at the Treasury though he retained the rank until retirement in 2007; the review team he headed was based in the Cabinet Office. It was reported that Stern's time at the Treasury was marked by tensions with his boss, Gordon Brown: > ... several Whitehall sources told The Times that Mr Brown did not like some > of the advice he received from Sir Nicholas, including some \\"home truths\\" > about long-term trends in the economy and he never broke into the > chancellor's tight-knit inner circle. ... He subsequently lacked a real role > and spent most of his time working on major international reports on global > warming and alleviating poverty in Africa. His doom-laden report on the > risks of failing to address climate change, published in October, caused > tensions within the Government by triggering a debate on environmental taxes > and leading to calls for big policy changes. = The Stern Review (2005–2006) = The Stern Review Report on the Economics of Climate Change was produced by a team led by Stern at HM Treasury, and was released in October 2006. In the review, climate change is described as an economic externality. Stern has subsequently referred to the climate change externality as the largest ever market failure: > Climate change is a result of the greatest market failure the world has > seen. The evidence on the seriousness of the risks from inaction or delayed > action is now overwhelming ... The problem of climate change involves a > fundamental failure of markets: those who damage others by emitting > greenhouse gases generally do not pay Regulation, carbon taxes and carbon trading are recommended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It is argued that the world economy can lower its greenhouse gas emissions at a significant but manageable cost. The review concludes that immediate reductions of greenhouse gas emissions are necessary to reduce the worst risks of climate change. The review's conclusions were widely reported in the press. Stern's relatively large cost estimates of 'business-as-usual' climate change damages received particular attention. – video, executive summary and slide show. These are the estimated damages that might occur should no further effort be made to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Stern at World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, January 2009 There has been a mixed reaction to the Stern Review from economists. Several economists have been critical of the review, for example, a paper by Byatt et al. (2006) describes the review as \\"deeply flawed\\". Some have supported the Review, while others have argued that Stern's conclusions are reasonable, even if the method by which he reached them is incorrect. The Stern Review team has responded to criticisms of the review in several papers. Stern has also gone on to say that he underestimated the risks of climate change in the Stern Review. Stern's approach to discounting has been debated amongst economists. The discount rate allows economic effects occurring at different times to be compared. Stern used a discount rate in his calculation of the effects of \\"business-as-usual\\" climate change damages. A high discount rate reduces the calculated benefit of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Using too low a discount rate wastes resources because it will result in too much investment in cutting emissions (Arrow et al., 1996, p. 130). Too high a discount rate will have the opposite effect, and lead to under-investment in cutting emissions. Most studies on the damages of climate change use a higher discount rate than that used in the Stern Review. Some economists support Stern's choice of discount rate (Cline, 2008; Shah, 2008 Heal, 2008) while others are critical (Yohe and Tol, 2008; Nordhaus, 2007). Another criticism of the Stern Review is that it is a political rather than an analytical document. Writing in the Daily Telegraph newspaper, columnist Charles Moore compared the Stern Review to the UK Government's \\"dodgy dossier\\" on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. = 2007–present = In a speech given in 2007 at the Australian National Press Club, Stern called for one per cent of gross global product to be employed in global warming-related environmental measures. He also joined the Cool Earth advisory board. In 2009, Stern linked recovery from the global economic crisis with an effective response to climate change. His book, Blueprint for a Safer Planet, was published in April 2009. In June 2007, Stern became the first holder of the I. G. Patel Chair at the London School of Economics. In 2007, Nicholas Stern joined IDEAglobal as Vice-Chairman. In 2008, he was appointed Chair of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, a major new research centre also at LSE. He is Chair of the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy at Leeds University and LSE. Stern is co-chair of the Global Commission for the Economy and Climate, with Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala and Paul Polman. In 2009, he published the non-fiction literary work, The Global Deal: Climate Change and the Creation of a New Era of Progress and Prosperity. The book examines climate change from an economist's perspective, and outlines the necessary steps toward achieving global economic growth while managing climate change. In 2009, he also became a member of the International Advisory Council of the Chinese sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corporation. Stern is an advocate of vegetarianism as a climate change mitigation element. He is a member of the scientific committee of the Fundacion IDEAS, Spain's Socialist Party's think tank. In 2015, he was co-author of the report that launched the Global Apollo Programme, which calls for developed nations to commit to spending 0.02% of their GDP for 10 years, to fund co-ordinated research to make carbon-free baseload electricity less costly than electricity from coal by the year 2025. After the successful United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris (mid-December 2015), Stern appeared optimistic, saying, \\"If we get this right, it will be more powerful than the industrial revolution. A green race is going on.\\" He also said In November 2015 he was commissioned by the UK Minister of Universities and Science, Jo Johnson to chair a review of the Research Excellence Framework (REF) that is used in assessing the research performance of Universities and Research Institutes in the UK.

It is a historic site. Already in Minoan times the region was a centre of trade. The port of Itanos, today several meters below sea level, is mentioned in ancient times. The very extensive Minoan commercial settlement Roussolakkos close to the Chiona beach, excavated by English archaeologists, clearly shows that the region was one of the most important commercial centres of the Minoan culture in the extreme east of the island of Crete. The Minoan Moulds of Palaikastro were discovered in October 1899 by a farmer 150 metres (160 yd) northeast of the village of Palaikastro. The Palaikastro Kouros is a carved figure of a youth that was recovered in fragments between 1987 and 1990. The village remains free from mass tourism. The main economic activity of the approximately 1100 inhabitants continues to be agriculture. Olives and grape vines are cultivated and a few fishermen remain. Commercial fishing however is difficult these days because of the substantial overfishing in the Mediterranean Sea. Tourism is an important source of supplementary income and is likely to remain so. At the east edge of the village, visible from a distance, there is a flat hill called Kastri(s). This hill gave Palaikastro its name in the Middle Ages, when Crete was ruled by the Republic of Venice. On its flat summit the Venetians established a fortress. In the course of the centuries the stones were cleared away and used by the people of the region to build houses.

The Court is essentially a cross between a court of exchequer, comptroller general's office, and auditor general's office in common-law countries. It is as well a Grand Corps of the French State mainly recruiting among the best students graduating from the Ecole nationale d'administration. The Court's three duties are to conduct financial audits of accounts, conduct good governance audits, and provide information and advice to the French Parliament and Administration. The Court verifies the good form of accounting and the proper handling of public money. Established in 1807, the Court is the successor to the Paris Court of Accounts under the monarchy, or Ancien Régime, and had inherent jurisdiction to audit all public accounting officials and agencies. The Court of Audit is independent from the legislative and executive branches of Government. However, the 1946 and 1958 French constitutions made it the Court's duty to assist the Cabinet and Parliament in regulating government spending. Composition The president (premier président) of the Court of Audit is appointed by Order-in-Council of the Cabinet. Once appointed, the president of the Court and division presidents have security of tenure. The Court has its own Office of the Prosecutor - with a Chief Prosecutor, Chief Deputy Prosecutor, and two deputy prosecutors - that represents the Government before the Court. The Court is split into seven divisions, each with nearly 30 judges ordinary and deputy judges and headed by a division president. Jurisdiction is split between the seven divisions generally by subject matter, e.g., finance, health and social security, and so forth. The Court's president is Didier Migaud who took over in 2010 following the death of Philippe Séguin. Other judicial officers are generally split into three groups by rank: * puisne judges (conseillers-maîtres) **consider, hear, and adjudicate cases in panels * deputy judges (conseillers référendaires) **divided into 2 classes; handle case management * Auditor-MastersThese are not just public financial auditors but also court officers, what are generally known as masters, auditors (in Chancery courts), and commissioners, and in charge of case management, document handling and filing, and presiding over pre-trial or post-trial hearings in addition to auditing agencies and offices. (auditeurs) **divided into 2 classes; preside over hearings, collect evidence, audit, and report All judicial officers are graduates from the National Administration Academy (École nationale d'Administration) or recruited from the Office of the Comptroller-General (inspection générale des Finances). Jurisdiction and dutiesOriginal jurisdiction= The French Court of Audit has original jurisdiction to audit and adjudicate accounts made by public, management, and government accountants. The Court also has authority to audit persons acting but not certified as a public accountant. If an account is found to be correct, then the Court issues a quietus to discharge the accountant. If, however, the account is found to be in error, then a debet order is issued against the defaulter. Either order is subject to appeal in the Court or final appeal at the French Supreme Court. Audits focus on: * Government accounting, budgets, and funds * Public corporations * National and public institutions, social security organizations, subsidiaries and sub- subsidiaries of public corporations * Government-funded organizations * Publicly funded organizations = Appellate jurisdiction = A decision from a lower audit court may be appealed at the main Court of Audit within two months of its being handed down. Afterwards, if the parties are still not satisfied, the Council of State will hear the case on final appeal. The French Court of Audit puts together its auditing program entirely independently and is vested with very broad powers of review and examination. It publishes and submits an annual audit report to the French President and to Parliament. The report provides a detailed account of the government's poor, or possibly fraudulent, practices and criticizes poor governance and use of public funds. The Court also audits authorizing officers (ordonnateurs) and their expenditures.Alain Héraud and André Maurin, Institutions judiciaires, 4th edn. (Paris: Dalloz, 2002), 82-3. Audit procedure In addition to reporting poor practices, the Court judges the accounting of public financial and budgetary officials, collection agencies, or treasury departments, e.g., treasurers, paymasters- general, tax collectors, certified public accountants, and can fine them for late reporting. In such cases, the Court fines public accounting officials for the exact amount of any sum of money that, due to an error on their part, they have unduly paid or failed to recover on behalf of the State. A debet (débet), from Latin \\"he owes\\" and not limited in amount, is entered against a defaulting person, and the defaulter becomes the State's debtor. Public and government accountants must therefore have performance liability insurance. Often, however, the Ministry of Finance alleviates a defaulter by granting an abatement of his arrears as the full amount is likely too much to ever pay out of pocket. If an account is audited and found not to be in default, then the Court issues a quietus (arrêt de quitus or arrêt de décharge) acquitting and discharging the official and settling the account.Véronique Le Marchand and Frédéric Touboul, eds., Mini-guide de la justice (Toulouse, France: Milan, 2003), 48. Regional audit courts The Court of Audit of France stands above and heads 27 regional inferior financial courts referred to in French as Chambres régionales des comptes, or regional audit courts. The Court of Audit acts as the administrative head and court of appeal for the financial stream, hearing appeals from regional courts and issuing rule promulgation orders and administrative directives. Regional audit courts were established in 1982 to help unburden the main Court of Audit of its heavy caseload. Since their creation, they have original jurisdiction for most local, county, and regional accounting matters in continental France and its overseas dependencies. This means they audit accounts as well as public institutions to check for fraud, embezzlement, or misappropriation. In case of budgetary discrepancies, the Court can ask the local prefect to intervene and oversee the handling of public funds until budget problems have been corrected.Le Marchand and Touboul, op. cit., 49. Each court is divided into divisions and includes a judge-in-Charge - who is also either a puisne or deputy judge at the main Court of Audit - and two associate judges. Judges have security of tenure and some also serve as Commissioners-in-Council with prosecutorial duties under the Office of the Prosecutor at the Court of Audit of France. The regional courts focus on: * budgetary audits and assessment of local public institutions' budget use and management * audits of institutions and agencies in a given regional jurisdiction, namely: public institutions (schools, public housing, hospitals) or groups funded or aided by local governments or public institutions (unions or trade associations) * efficiency evaluations of account management Accounts found to be in error are entered into debet and accounts in default or fictitious are referred to the local prefect.

The Club has been revived by a group of alumni, playing their first game in March 2020. History The club was founded in 1948 as a joint venture of Oxford University A.F.C. and Cambridge University A.F.C., instigated by Harold Warris Thompson, professor at St. John's College, Oxford and later an administrator with The Football Association. The founding president was Kenneth Hunt, formerly of the star amateur club Corinthian F.C. The symbol Pegasus was chosen as containing elements from the logos of the football clubs of both Oxford University (a centaur) and Cambridge University (a falcon). At first, members had to be current Oxford or Cambridge University players or to have left the previous year, but this rule was later relaxed. In the postwar years, Oxbridge students included many men in their twenties demobilised from service in World War II. Pegasus had an attractive style similar to the Tottenham Hotspur of the day, whose Vic Buckingham and Bill Nicholson had previously coached Oxford and Cambridge respectively. The club had great success in the 1950s including wins at Wembley Stadium in the FA Amateur Cup in 1951, which finished 2–1 against Bishop Auckland, and 1953, which finished 6–0 against Harwich & Parkeston in front of a full house of 100,000 spectators. On both occasions, the semi-final was played at Highbury and was drawn, so that a replay was necessary. In the 1951 semi-final, Pegasus's opponents, Hendon, were awarded a penalty in the last minute, but missed it, and Pegasus won the replay at Selhurst Park. In 1954, Pegasus toured Hong Kong, and supplied seven members of the England amateur international team. Changes in university culture in the 1960s and defections to Corinthian- Casuals undermined its ethos and the club folded in 1963, following an Oxfordshire Senior Cup tie against Marston United.

After spending thirteen years there, he wrote \\"Hamel's Journal and a Description of the Kingdom of Korea, 1653-1666,\\" which was subsequently published in 1668. Hendrick Hamel was born in Gorinchem, Netherlands. In 1650, he sailed to the Dutch East Indies where he found work as a bookkeeper with the Dutch East India Company (VOC). In 1653, while sailing to Japan on the ship “De Sperwer” (The Sparrowhawk), Hamel and thirty-five other crewmates survived a deadly shipwreck on Jeju Island in South Korea. After spending close to a year on Jeju in the custody of the local prefect, the men were taken to Seoul, the capital of Joseon Korea, in June, 1655, where King Hyojong (r. 1649 to 1659) was on the throne. As was customary treatment of foreigners at the time, the government forbade Hamel and his crew from leaving the country. During their stay, however, they were given freedom to live relatively normal lives in Korean society In September 1666, after thirteen years in Korea, Hamel and seven of his crewmates managed to escape to Japan where the Dutch operated a small trade mission on an artificial island in the Nagasaki harbor called Dejima. It was during his time in Nagasaki (September 1666 to October 1667) that Hamel wrote his account of his time in Korea. From here, Hamel and his crew left to Batavia (modern day Jakarta) in the Dutch East Indies in late 1667. Although Hamel sojourned in Batavia until 1670, experts speculate that his crew, returning to the Netherlands in 1667, brought his manuscript with them, where three versions of it were published in 1668. Hamel himself did not return to the Netherlands until 1670. Hamel in the Joseon Korea Jeju Island = On Jeju Island, the sudden appearance of thirty-six Europeans created no small stir among the Korean inhabitants. On August 21, four days after the shipwreck, Hamel and his crew were taken to Jeju city, upon which the local prefect, Yi Wonjin, sent an announcement to the king in Seoul, describing the event of the shipwreck and requesting advice on how to deal with the Dutchmen. In October of the same year, the local government brought Jan Janse Weltevree (Korean name “Park-Yeon”), a Dutchman who himself had become shipwrecked on Korea 27 years prior, to converse with Hamel and his crew. With the help of Weltevree, the Dutchmen formed a positive relationship with Yi Wonjin. Several months into their stay on Jeju, Yi Wonjin was replaced by a new prefect, who was cruel to Hamel and his crew. Soon after the new prefect replaced Yi Wonjin, he received a response to Yi Wonjin's announcement that had been sent to the Joseon court months earlier. Although the announcement dismissed any chance of the crew's release, it declared that the Korean government had “a moral obligation to ease their existence,” It also called for the castaways to be sent to Seoul. = Seoul = Once Hamel and his crew arrived in Seoul, they were taken before king Hyojong With the help of Jan Janse Weltevree, they begged the king to release them so they could return home to their wives and children. The king denied their request, citing official policy. The king then asked the Dutchmen to entertain him with song and dance from their home country. During their two years in Seoul, Hamel and his crew served in the king's guard. They lived in a complex administered by Korean landlords and, in addition to their duties in the king's guard, performed domestic chores for their landlords. Outside of these duties, Hamel and his crew were permitted to live relatively normal lives. = Jeolla Province = In 1656, two of Hamel's crew caused a disturbance when they ambushed a Manchu envoy on its way to Seoul and begged the Manchu officials to help them escape. Because of this, and mounting pressure to dispose of the Dutchmen, in 1657, King Hyojong banished Hamel and his crew to a military garrison in Jeolla Province on the Southwest corner of the peninsula. Life in Jeolla Province was relatively normal. During the seven years Hamel and his crew stayed there, they acquired “houses, households and gardens, all nicely set up after the customs of the country.” Much of their well-being and comfort depended on the attitude of the commandant in charge. Some commandants were crueler than others, burdening Hamel and his crew with extra duties. At one point, Hamel and his crew resorted to begging, a vocation they actually found rewarding since, as foreigners, they had no trouble drawing a large crowd. At least one of these men founded the Byeongyeong Nam clan.  Escape to Japan  Because of a famine that cursed the region from 1659 to 1663, Korean officials at the garrison decided to divide the burden of hosting the Dutchmen between three different areas. Of the twenty-two Dutchmen still alive, five went to Suncheon, five went to Namwon, and twelve, including Hamel, went to the headquarters of the Left Provincial Naval District, near modern-day Yeosu. Situated on the water, Hamel and the group at the naval district quickly recognized they were in an excellent position to escape. Down to eight from the original twelve, the group slowly gathered supplies and negotiated the purchase of a small fishing boat from a local Korean. On September 4, 1666, an especially dark day with good tidal conditions, the men left their compound, loaded their boat, and headed out to sea. Four days later, Japanese boats found Hamel and his crew near the Goto island chain. After communicating with the Koreans about the situation and running into some diplomatic complications, the Japanese were finally able to return Hamel and his crew to Deshima, the Dutch trade mission at Nagasaki. During the negotiations, per Hamel's request, the Japanese inquired about the remaining crewmen in Korea. Two years later, the Japanese secured their release as well. During his time in Nagasaki (September 1666 to October 1667) Hamel wrote his account of his time in Korea. From here, Hamel and his crew left to Batavia (modern day Jakarta) in the Dutch East Indies in late 1667. Although his crew continued on to the Netherlands in 1668, Hamel himself stayed in Batavia until 1670 trying, in vain, to secure fourteen years of back salary from the Dutch East India Company. Once his crew returned to the Netherlands, experts believe they had three versions of Hamel's original manuscript published. Dutch Recognition of Hamel Back in 17th century Holland, Hamel was just another of the many former VOC crewmen with many adventurous stories to tell. He had sailed the Seven Seas at a time when dozens of VOC ships plied their trade, fought sea battles, survived disasters, made discoveries and enjoyed adventures. Unsurprisingly, the events described in his journal were regarded as a mere curiosity. Only recently has Hamel's hometown acknowledged his role as an explorer. In a major move to pay homage to its famous traveler, the old fortress town of Gorinchem now boasts a statue of Hamel. A second, similar casting was added to the Hamel monument in the South Korean town of Gangjin. The first public recognition of Hamel in the Netherlands occurred early in the 20th century, when a local street was named after him. The street still exists. See also *Jan Jansz.

It is located between the towns of Fitzroy Crossing and Turkey Creek (Warmun) on the Great Northern Highway. It is the only sizeable town for 600 km on the Highway. Halls Creek is also the northern end of the Canning Stock Route, which runs 1,850 km through the Great Sandy Desert until the southern end of the route at Wiluna. The town functions as a major hub for the local indigenous population and as a support centre for cattle stations in the area. Halls Creek is the administration centre for Halls Creek Shire Council. History The land now known as Halls Creek has been occupied for thousands of years by Aboriginal peoples. The land is crossed by songlines and trading paths stretching from the coasts to the deserts, some passing near the modern town. The story of that long occupation remains alive today and it is revealed in the culture of the Jaru, Kija, Kukatja, Walmajarri, Gooniyandi and other Indigenous people who live in Halls Creek Shire. Late in the 19th Century, Europeans arrived, searching for land for cattle and sheep, as well as minerals. On Christmas Day 1885 prospector Charlie Hall found a huge gold nugget at a site that would eventually be named after him. News of the discovery drew more than 15,000 people to what is now Old Halls Creek to try their luck. It proved an inhospitable land for these people and the graves of some can be found in Old Town's small cemetery. The gold rush lasted less than three months and Halls Creek became a trading centre for cattle stations, Aboriginal communities and miners who stayed in the area. The post office with its telegraph line that terminated here, the police station, government office, racecourse and stores gave the town a purpose. In 1918 the Australian Inland Mission built a hospital and the old town continued, with few inhabitants and little water. In 1948 an airfield was built near the site of the present town and over the next decade the old town moved nearer to this new site. Except for the police station, which finally relocated in 1961, the old town was abandoned by 1954. The nearby settlements known as Chinaman's Garden (Yarrunga) and Wangu Outstation (Flora Valley Station) were funded by the federal government as outstations during the 1980s.

In May 2009 the state Director of Liquor Licensing imposed a \\"prohibition on the sale of packaged liquor with an alcohol content greater than 2.7 per cent from licensed premises\\" in the town. In September 2009 it was reported that assaults and drink driving arrests had decreased dramatically as a result of the bans. Full strength alcohol can be purchased with a meal at the local motel or hotel, however take-away sales of alcohol above 2.7% Alc./Vol. are prohibited. Halls Creek has two distinct seasons, the wet season (November - March) and the dry season (April - October). Permanent surface water sources are scarce during the dry season. Always carry plenty of water. During the wet season, Halls Creek is often cut off due to flooding. People traveling during the wet should be extremely cautious of flood ways and bridges, as water levels can rise and fall very rapidly. Permits are required in some areas and permission should always be sought before visiting Aboriginal communities. Always seek local advice and never travel on a closed road. Impact craters Aside from the well known and well preserved Wolfe Creek Crater, averaging about 875 metres in diameter, nearby there is also Goat Paddock crater, 7 km in diameter and 106 km west- southwest of Halls Creek, and Piccaninny crater, 7 km in diameter, within the Purnululu (Bungle Bungle) National Park. Near the other end of the Tanami Road in the Northern Territory, over 1000 km away from Halls Creek, is Gosses Bluff crater, with the 5 km diameter, 180 m high crater-like feature, now exposed, being interpreted as the eroded relic of the crater's central uplift. Indigenous population In the 2016 Census, there were 1,546 people in Halls Creek. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 66.9% of the population. It is home to the Indigenous Jaru (Djar-u) and Kija (gKid-ja) peoples as well as some Tjurabalan peoples from the desert to the south of the town. Indigenous people represent over 70% of the town's population and have lived in the region for at least 30,000 years.Shire of Halls Creek, Travel and Tourism Guide, p7, 2015. > \\"Aboriginal people in Halls Creek are predominantly Jaru and Kija peoples. > Many residents celebrate both Jaru and Kija heritage. there are also > significant numbers of Gooniyandi people from further east, Walmajarri from > the south-east and Kukatja people originally from the desert country to the > south.

They have a history that goes back more than two thousand years, but are little known in the west. The oldest records date to the Three Kingdoms period (57 BC – 668 AD) when architecture and palace gardens showed a development noted in the Korean History of the Three Kingdoms. History Korean garden culture can be traced back more than 2,000 years. In recent years, 300 documents have been found, written during the Koryo (918–1392) and Choson (1392–1910) dynasties, that contain detailed records about traditional Korean gardens, many of which survive and can be visited today. In prehistoric times, Koreans worshipped nature, the sun, stars, water, rocks, stones, and trees. They especially believed that rocks had more power than water and other things in nature. Also, they have believed that rocks engendered God's good-will. Therefore, the arrangement of rocks is considered as one of the \\"essential\\" elements in designing the traditional Korean garden. Koreans have recently rediscovered their stone garden tradition in the stacked stone altars that express the ancient concept of a round heaven and square earth. Also Susok or \\"rock arrangement,\\" gardens are commonly found. In recent years, in fact, there has been a revival of interest in rock arrangements in gardens. In general, Korean Susok (rock arrangement) garden culture can be described according to its stages of development. Even during the primitive agricultural period, stones were an essential element in building gardens. Then, rock arrangements for shamanic rituals were built in the shape of shrines or heavenly altars. During the Three Kingdoms period (57 BC – 668 AD), palace gardens were erected on a grand scale with stones. And in the 4th-century temple gardens were introduced along with Buddhism. Since the early Koryo dynasty, when Buddhism was established as the national religion, gardens evolved into the style of Hwagye (terraced rock garden), which represented Son (Zen) Buddhist rock arrangements. In the middle of the Koryo period, a new style of stone garden, called Imchon, which contained a pavilion and a stone pond in beautiful forest surroundings, became popular. During the Joseon dynasty, the Hwagye garden style was popular in the yards of many homes, and mansion gardens were usually built in Imchon style. Style and symbolism Korean gardens are structured to live in harmony with pre-existing landscapes. Sites are chosen in favor of the energy flow called pungsu 풍수, geomancy which affects all aspects of life including health, wealth, and happiness. Unlike gardening styles of the west, the construction of a Korean garden must be done with as little disruption to the pre-existing site as possible, and can even lend from the surrounding view, such as mountains on the horizon, into its own appearance. The gardens can be found enclosed within walls of stone or brick or can blend seamlessly into its surroundings without a barrier. Buildings and pavilions in the gardens are minimal in number and unobtrusive to the thriving natural landscape. Stylized flowers and blossoms that hold great symbolism, such as the Sacred Lotus and plum blossoms, are painted onto Buddhist temples, royal tombs, and palace pavilions in bright yet harmonious colors; a style called dancheong 단청, or “red and blue/green.” Traditional spiritual and philosophical symbolism can be found throughout Korean gardens; Shamanistic, Animist, Buddhist, Daoist, and Confucian influences along with homage to the Dangun Creation story are often simultaneously represented. From the clear symbols such as stylized decorations painted on pavilions and buildings, to the use of colors and the number and types of trees, rocks, ponds, and plants, all Korean gardens hold a significance of beauty aesthetically, culturally, and spiritually. Examples of Tree Types and their Meanings: Persimmon: The Persimmon tree symbolizes transformation. Jill Mathews, author of Korean Gardens, writes, “… their fruit starts off hard, green, and extremely bitter but ripens to a bright orange and becomes very soft and sweet…” Korean Red Pine: Symbolizes loyalty, constancy, and righteousness. The bark resembles the shell of the tortoise, which symbolizes longevity. Often used near Confucian scholarly buildings and pavilions. Called sonamu 소나무 meaning supreme tree. Bamboo: Simplicity, integrity, flexibility. Its uprightness symbolizes strength while its hollow stem equates to open-mindedness. Crepe Myrtle: Baerong Namu 배롱나무, meaning “Tree with flowers lasting more than 100 days”, symbolize integrity and loyalty of Confucian scholars and can be found in Confucian academy gardens. Flowers: Peonies: Known as the Queen of Flowers, both the tree peony and the herbaceous peony symbolize royalty, riches, honor, female beauty, and love. Lotus: The lotus is recognizable as a sacred symbol in Buddhism and can be found in ponds of both Buddhist temples and Confucian academies, symbolizing purity, transformation, and enlightenment. Rocks: The symbolism of rocks can be found in their number and structure, for instance, three rocks in an arrangement can represent the three mountain gods in the Dangun creation story. Matthews notes that, “… rocks appear in two’s, three’s, nine’s, or twelves, although there are occasional extravagant arrangements of sixty.” Rocks can be selected and assigned special names either based upon their appearance, or some unconnected meaning, however, no stones are taken from far distances and added to the garden. Ponds: Ponds symbolize tranquility and stillness; inviting deep contemplation from visitors. Their bridges can symbolize moving from lower thought processes to more sacred thoughts, or the movement from life on Earth into the tranquil afterlife. The Daoist and Confucian belief that heaven is round and the Earth is square is often reflected in the appearance of ponds and their island; the pond being square in shape and the island being round. \\"Few Korean gardens are considered complete without at least one pond.\\" Representative Korean gardens The most central and representative and relatively undisturbed classical Korean gardens are in three complexes. *The Iseong mountain fortress of Baekje near Seoul, where one finds numerous rockeries depicting turtles, dragons or phoenixes *The Anak Palace Garden of Goguryeo near Pyongyang, where one finds the remains of three rock Garden complexes. *The Anapji Garden of Silla in Gyeongju is perhaps the best known, with three islands in the pond, man-made waterfalls in two tiers, granite basins of round and square design as well as hundreds of rock arrangement along its curbed shore. Further important gardens, often historical recreations, are found at these sites: * The rear garden of Changdeok Palace in Seoul, especially the Buyong pond with the pavilion of cosmic union. * The Chongpyeong-sa temple near Chuncheon. Restoration work National scholars in the Republic of Korea are now attempting to build a database through drawings, photographs, and surveys of the landscape of traditional gardens, and attempt recreations. Rumoured attempts at recreating classical Korean gardens are said to be occurring on small scales in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, but as yet there is no pictorial evidence. Trees, plants and symbolic landscape of a Korean garden Garden in Jejudo The vernacular of the Korean garden generally includes evergreen trees (various species of Korean pine) as a constant; flowering pear trees in the spring; bamboo forests alongside the secondary entrance gates of temples and palaces symbolizing fidelity and honesty; and straight walks tend to be bordered by larger sized gravels of irregular shape. These features are especially noticeable in restorations. Terrain tends to follow natural courses, and unlike the traditional Chinese garden, the use of straight paths is not proscribed, but lessened. Significant or important elements tend to face east. And Korean readings of Pungsu are regarded with great care, as geomancy was a strong influence in aligning the gardens with stelae, halls, and buildings. Unusual features A Korean garden is interesting for attracting various birds. Animals were important to the natural appeal of the garden, so stone animals and animal motifs were common as well as actual fish, birds, and other creatures. A Korean garden will often have a decorative pavilion from which the surrounding garden can be enjoyed. Scholars from the yangban aristocracy sat in their pavilions constructed in either a cultivated garden or a natural area with its own view of the mountains or landscape. These served as places of relaxation and enjoyment and as a place to receive other men to be entertained or to talk about business. Playing chess, painting, resting and other leisurely activities were also pursued in these pavilions because of the exceptional view and surrounding beauty. A Korean garden may also often have ponds because water is an important element to any garden for practical reasons such as plant watering and cooling the temperature. It was also important in old days because it prevented the wooden buildings of Korea from burning down. In the garden, a murky green color is prized unlike the Western love of blue water. Clear water is generally found in streams and natural water sources rather than ponds which are dug out on purpose in a convenient spot. Sometimes the water looks black if the inside of the pond is walled with stone blocks. Lotuses are usually the most common thing to plant in a pond, but there are many unusual options other than lotuses. Huwon in Changduk Palace is a huge garden showing the refined style of the imperial family. It contains many trees which are hundreds of years old however and is carefully monitored and preserved from the public. The style of Huwon is very different from the gardens of the yangban classes and is much more refined. However, like all Korean gardens, it has a very natural beauty in which the royal family could rest in a private place. Korean gardens abroad A traditional Korean garden is currently under construction in Nantes, France. \\"Suncheon Garden\\", a 5000 square metre site, is enclosed within Blottereau Park, and celebrates the 120th anniversary of diplomatic ties between South Korea and France. There are traditional Korean gardens in the Chapultepec Zoo in Mexico City; Gençlik Park in Ankara, Turkey; in Cairo, Egypt; le Jardin d'Acclimatation de Paris; Erholungspark Marzahn in Berlin; Grüneburgpark in Frankfurt; and at the VanDusen Botanical Garden in Vancouver, Canada. The Korean Ambassador's Residence Garden in Washington, D.C. is a typical example of a well-maintained Korean garden. Korean Garden Society The Traditional Korean Garden Society in Seoul, ROK, often sponsors lectures and tours of Korean gardens with Professor Sim Woo- kyung often acting as host and landscape interpreter.

The most widely distributed member of the otter subfamily (Lutrinae) of the weasel family (Mustelidae), it is found in the waterways and coasts of Europe, many parts of Asia, and parts of northern Africa. The Eurasian otter has a diet mainly of fish, and is strongly territorial. It is endangered in some parts of its range, but is recovering in others. Description The Eurasian otter is a typical species of the otter subfamily. Brown above and cream below, these long, slender creatures are well-equipped for their aquatic habits. Their bones show osteosclerosis, increasing their density to reduce buoyancy. This otter differs from the North American river otter by its shorter neck, broader visage, the greater space between the ears and its longer tail.Godman, John Davidson (1836) American Natural History, Hogan & Thompson. However, the Eurasian otter is the only otter in much of its range, so it is rarely confused for any other animal. Normally, this species is long, not counting a tail of . The female is shorter than the male.

(1983) The Guinness Book of Animal Facts and Feats. Sterling Pub Co Inc., Distribution and habitat The Eurasian otter is the most widely distributed otter species, its range including parts of Asia and Africa, as well as being spread across Europe, south to Israel. Though currently believed to be extinct in Liechtenstein and Switzerland, they are now very common in Latvia, along the coast of Norway, in the western regions of Spain and Portugal and across Great Britain, especially Shetland, where 12% of the UK breeding population exists. Ireland's otters are geographically widespread and believed to be the most stable population in Europe. In Italy, they can be found in southern parts of the peninsula. The South Korean population is endangered. In India, the species is distributed in the Himalayan foothills, southern Western Ghats and the central Indian landscape. In general, their varied and adaptable diets mean they may inhabit any unpolluted body of fresh water, including lakes, streams, rivers, canals and ponds, as long as the food supply is adequate. In Andalusia, the golf courses became part of their habitat. Eurasian otters may also live along the coast, in salt water, but require regular access to fresh water to clean their fur. When living in the sea, individuals of this species are sometimes referred to as \\"sea otters\\", but they should not be confused with the true sea otter, a North Pacific species much more strongly adapted to a marine existence. The extinct Japanese river otter is usually considered a subspecies. Diet Otter feeding on fish Video of otters eating frozen fish in the Aquarium of Gijón, Spain The Eurasian otter's diet mainly consists of fish. Fish is their most preferred choice of food in Mediterranean and temperate freshwater habitats. During the winter and in colder environments, though, fish consumption is significantly lower, and the otters use other sources of food, including amphibians, crustaceans, insects, birds and sometimes small mammals, including young beavers. Breeding Skull of a Eurasian otter Eurasian otters are strongly territorial, living alone for the most part. An individual's territory may vary between about long, with about being usual. The length of the territory depends on the density of food available and the width of the water suitable for hunting (it is shorter on coasts, where the available width is much wider, and longer on narrower rivers).The Eurasian otter uses its feces, spraints, to mark its territory and prioritize the use of resources to other group members. The territories are only held against members of the same sex, so those of males and females may overlap. Mating takes place in water. Eurasian otters are nonseasonal breeders (males and females will breed at any time of the year) and it has been found that their mating season is most likely determined simply by the otters' reproductive maturity and physiological state. Female otters become sexually mature between 18 and 24 months old and the average age of first breeding is found to be years. Gestation for the Eurasian otter is 60–64 days, the litter weighing about 10% of the female body mass. After the gestation period, one to four pups are born, which remain dependent on the mother for about 13 months. The male plays no direct role in parental care, although the territory of a female with her pups is usually entirely within that of the male. Hunting mainly takes place at night, while the day is usually spent in the Eurasian otter's holt (den) – usually a burrow or hollow tree on the riverbank which can sometimes only be entered from underwater. Though long thought to hunt using sight and touch only, evidence is emerging that they may also be able to smell underwater – possibly in a similar manner to the star-nosed mole. Conservation A Eurasian otter skeleton The Eurasian otter declined across its range in the second half of the 20th century primarily due to pollution from pesticides such as organochlorine and polychlorinated biphenyls. Other threats included habitat loss and hunting, both legal and illegal. Eurasian otter populations are now recovering in many parts of Europe. In the United Kingdom, the number of sites with an otter presence increased by 55% between 1994 and 2002. In August, 2011, the Environment Agency announced that otters had returned to every county in England since vanishing from every county except the West Country and parts of Northern England. Recovery is partly due to a ban on the most harmful pesticides that has been in place across Europe since 1979, partly to improvements in water quality leading to increases in prey populations, and partly to direct legal protection under the European Union Habitats Directive and national legislation in several European countries.Otters of the world. otter.org In Hong Kong, it is a protected species under Wild Animals Protection Ordinance Cap 170. It is listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN Red List. In Asia, it is listed as endangered in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Thailand, and critically endangered in Mongolia. Most species that are victims of population decline or a loss of habitat tend to eventually lose their genetic difference due to inbreeding from small populations. A study conducted in 2001, examined whether or not the populations of Eurasian otters suffered from a lack of genetic variability. In the study, they examined teeth of otter skulls at the Zoological Museum, Copenhagen and the Natural History Museum, Aarhus. The samples were collected between 1883 and 1963 in Denmark (Funen, Zealand, and Jutland). The study examined the tissue on the teeth of the skulls and determined the genetic variability based on DNA analysis. In conclusion, the study discovered that despite the population declines, the Eurasian otter was not a victim of declining genetic variability. The decline in population of native freshwater fishes, which is the preferred food of Eurasian otters, in the rivers of Iberia, along with the expansion of exotic fish species like centrarchids could potentially put Eurasian otters at risk for extinction.

For the legal practice, see Rule of four. The Rule of Four is a novel written by the American authors Ian Caldwell and Dustin Thomason, and published in 2004. Caldwell, a Princeton University graduate, and Thomason, a Harvard College graduate, are childhood friends who wrote the book after their graduations. The Rule of Four reached the top of the New York Times Bestseller list, where it remained for more than six months. Plot summary The book is set on the Princeton campus during Easter weekend in 1999. The story involves four Princeton seniors, both friends and roommates, getting ready for graduation: Tom, Paul, Charlie and Gil. Tom and Paul are trying to solve the mystery contained within an extremely rare, and mysterious book, the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili, which was an incunabulum published in 1499 in Venice, Italy; it is a complex allegorical work written in a modified Italian language frequently interspersed with material from other languages as well as its anonymous author's own made-up words. Tom, the narrator, is the son of a professor who had dedicated his life to the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili. Throughout the novel, he struggles between being fascinated by the book and trying to pull away from the obsession that drew a rift between his father and his mother and is now causing discord between him and his girlfriend, Katie Marchand. Paul Harris is a young scholar who is writing his senior thesis on the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili and has spent all four of his undergraduate years studying the book and is on the edge of solving the book's mystery. Charlie and Gil are supporting characters to Tom and Paul's project. The novel charts the relationship between the four roommates and how obsession can be both a boon and a burden. It is a story about growing up as much as solving the mystery of the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili. The disciplines of Renaissance science, history, architecture, and art are drawn upon to solve the mystery. Tom, or Thomas Corelli Sullivan, often found himself distracted by his father's death. His father was a close friend of Richard Curry and Vincent Taft, both of them advisors for Paul's thesis. The flashback goes on as Taft distanced himself from both Curry and Tom's father at some point to carry out his own research. Taft also developed a rivalry with both men in the quest to decode the Hypnerotomachia's 500-year- old secret. By luck, Tom's father found a letter, dating back to Renaissance times, referring to the book's supposed author, Francesco Colonna. Tom's father even wrote a book, The Belladona Document, which revolves around the mysterious letter. But, a negative critique from his academic rival Vincent Taft spelled the demise of the book's popularity as well as his career. Taft allegedly also stole a diary written by a contemporary of Colonna's that Curry had found. That diary, as Paul and Tom discovered it later, would prove to help the duo to decode the elusive Hypnerotomachia. In the end, Paul discovers that the Hypnerotomachia contains a number of hidden and enciphered texts, with the solution to each one revealing a clue towards the next one. However, after solving a chain of several of these, he finds a text that says that there will be no more clues and he must solve the rest of the book on his own. He realizes that the entire book contains a message encoded by following a \\"rule of four\\", in which the message starts with one letter, then moves to a letter four rows down, then ten columns right, then two rows up, then six columns left, and repeating. The placement of this hidden text throughout the entire book explains the Hypnerotomachia's strange syntax, use of multiple languages, and neologisms. Through days of tough work, Paul and Tom managed to unravel a series of riddles, which they solved soon later. The application of the \\"rule of four\\" method enabled them to slowly piece together portions of a dark Renaissance secret that has avoided human knowledge for centuries. The author of the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili, Francesco Colonna, was a Renaissance humanist in Florence. He is an ardent fan of knowledge, books, arts and anything that has a Renaissance identity on it. His passion for Greek and Roman literature was immense. But a fanatical priest, one Girolamo Savonarola, sees the exact opposite; in his mind Florence was gradually turning into a free-thinking city, with its people starting to forget God and worshipping knowledge. As soon as he rises to power in Florence, Savonarola starts the infamous Bonfire of the Vanities, a practice of burning books and art that seemed to contain elements of blasphemy. Colonna could not stand this practice and confronted Girolamo Savonarola himself as a sign of protest, only to be disappointed. Colonna started the building of a large underground vault to seal away a number of ancient books and pieces of art to preserve them and protect them from the followers of the priest. On one occasion, to prove his stand, Francesco and two of his men walked onto the raging inferno of the bonfire. As a result, Francesco met a fiery end. As he expected, the death of Francesco sparked the cry against the reign of Savonarola, who was later himself hung and then burnt to ashes. Before dying, Colonna wrote the Hypnerotomachia, an encrypted book, in his efforts to uplift humanism despite religious dogmas. He disguises its contents in a seemingly innocent piece of Renaissance romantic literature, concerning the love between Poliphilo and Polia. Hypnerotomachia Poliphili itself meant \\"Poliphilo's Struggle of Love in a Dream\\". It also turns out that Paul's friend Bill Stein and his thesis advisor Vincent Taft were conspiring together to steal Paul's thesis and claim credit for it, and the sealed vault of treasures. They were murdered by Paul's wealthy but unstable benefactor Richard Curry to prevent this from happening. In a final struggle between a team of Tom, Gil and Paul against Richard Curry, a fire breaks out at Ivy Club, a Princeton eating club of which Gil is the president. After much persuasion by both Tom and Paul to save each other from the fire, Tom jumps out of a window to be rescued by the firemen. Paul does not manage to do so, leading both Tom and Gil to assume that he must have died in the fire together with Curry. Five years pass. Charlie is already married with two children; Tom is still traumatized by the event that occurred that day. He has subsequently become a software analyst and gotten engaged to another woman, only for it to fail later. One day, he receives a tube in the mail containing an authentic ancient (and unknown) Botticelli canvas. The tube has a mysterious return address in Florence, Italy. Tom realizes the address is a code by his long lost friend Paul Harris, urging him to head towards Italy soon. The story ends with Tom packing his clothes and reconnecting with Katie by phone, telling her that he is leaving for Italy and that he wants to see her when he returns. Critical reception The book has been well received by critics, with the New York Times Book Review calling it \\"the ultimate puzzle book\\", and several others comparing it positively to The Da Vinci Code. It received an aggregate score of 74 out of 100 (based on 17 reviews) on the review aggregator Metacritic.

Reusable bags are often made from jute cloth, also known as burlap in the U.S. Some are made of plastic, but reusable plastic bags are sturdier than single- use plastic bags. In the U.S., reusable bags are sometimes used as a fashion statement or for advertising. * In the United States and Canada, single-use plastic bags are commonly provided free with a shop purchase in many localities. Some retailers, such as department stores, are more likely to provide paper bags to shoppers, whereas supermarkets and grocery stores tend to give plastic shopping bags. People are encouraged to have reusable shopping bags, whenever possible; in some municipalities (Chicago, for example) they must pay a government-mandated fee if they use plastic shopping bags. Some municipalities charge a tax for paper shopping bags. ** California banned disposable bags. All local jurisdictions in Hawaii banned plastic bags. ** In an effort to reduce plastic bag use, the city of Toronto, Canada, required retailers to charge a minimum fee for each plastic bag.

Grimwade's talent as a director was evident during his time at Truro Cathedral School: in his final year there, he was responsible for a production of The Monkey's Paw. After joining the BBC in the late 1960s, he first worked on Doctor Who as a Production Assistant on Jon Pertwee's first serial, Spearhead from Space (1970).https://drwhointerviews.wordpress.com/category/peter-grimwade/ He occupied this position on a further five serials.

Grimwade next directed some episodes of the drama series All Creatures Great and Small (1978) (which coincidentally featured Peter Davison, who Grimwade would direct twice and write for three times on Doctor Who) before returning to Doctor Who as a director. After directing the serial Full Circle (1980) Grimwade was given the task of directing Tom Baker's final serial, Logopolis. When Peter Davison became the Doctor, Grimwade first directed him in the serial Kinda (1982)https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/kinda/detail.shtml and then directed Earthshock,http://www.radiotimes.com/blog/2012-01-22/time- flight featuring the return of the Cybermen to the show after seven years and the death of the character Adric. Earthshock was the last time he was a director on the series. A year later, Grimwade was scheduled to direct the serial The Return (which ultimately became Resurrection of the Daleks). Industrial action initially prevented the serial from being filmed.https://io9.gizmodo.com/peter-davison-explains-whats-wrong-with-doctor- whos-son-5790964 When the story was postponed, Grimwade took the cast and crew out to dinner, but did not invite John Nathan-Turner, because he had intended to take Nathan-Turner out separately. However, Nathan-Turner felt slighted by the omission and refused to allow Grimwade to direct the story when it was re- scheduled for Season 21, the story was ultimately assigned to director Matthew Robinson instead. Prior to this, Grimwade had written two serials - Time- Flight and Mawdryn Undead (1983).https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/mawdrynundead/detail.shtml Afterwards, Grimwade was asked to write Davison's penultimate story, which became Planet of Fire. Because the story's requirements were in constant flux, mainly due to uncertainty over the filming location and cast changes, he eventually became frustrated and allowed script editor Eric Saward to finish the serial. A short documentary about Grimwade's contribution to Doctor Who is included on the DVD for Kinda which includes interview footage of the director from the 1980s. Outside of Doctor Who, Grimwade wrote and directed The Come- Uppance of Captain Katt for the ITV children's drama series Dramarama. The play was about events behind-the-scenes on a low-budget television science fiction series, which Grimwade openly acknowledged was inspired by his experience working on Doctor Who. When the BBC gave the publisher W. H. Allen the rights to use Vislor Turlough in the novel Turlough and the Earthlink Dilemma, W. H. Allen offered Grimwade a chance to publish an original novel. The result was Robot (), a book filled with Doctor Who references. Afterwards, Grimwade left the BBC and mainly worked in producing industrial training videos. He died in 1990 of leukaemia. League of the Tancreds (Doctor Who)  On 13 August 1984 Grimwade commissioned a four story entitled: ‘The League of the Tancreds’.List of unmade Doctor Who serials and films The story was to be set in 1890s New York, the Doctor and Peri would encounter a insectoid race called the ‘Tancreds’. The story was abandoned on 18 November 1984 due to other budget concerns. It was eventually adapted to a novel as Doctor Who: Birthright by Nigel Robinson in August 1993.

The reservoir is part of the Ord River Irrigation Scheme and is located near the East Kimberley town of Kununurra. The lake flooded large parts of the Shire of Wyndham-East Kimberley on the Kimberley Plateau about inland from the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf, close to the border with the Northern Territory. The primary inflow is the Ord River, while the Bow River and many other smaller creeks also flow into the dam. The lake is a DIWA-listed wetland. as it is the largest lake in northern Australia and an excellent example of a man-made lake. Additionally Lake Argyle, along with Lake Kununurra, are recognised as a Ramsar protected wetlands and were listed in 1990 as Australian Site Number 32. History and construction The traditional owners are the Miriwoong Gajerrong peoples who have inhabited the area for thousands of years and knew the Ord river as Goonoonoorrang. The dams were built with no consultation with or compensation to the Indigenous traditional owners. The construction of the Ord River Dam was completed in 1971 by the American Dravo Corporation. The dam was officially opened the following year. The dam wall is long, and high. The earth-fill only dam wall at Lake Argyle is the most efficient dam in Australia in terms of the ratio of the size of the dam wall to the amount of water stored. The lake was named after the property it partly submerged, Argyle Downs. Ord River Dam post office opened on 1 March 1969 and closed on 15 November 1971 demonstrating the approximate duration of the construction camp. In 1996, the spillway wall was raised by , which doubled the dam's capacity. Sediment flowing into the dam caused concerns in the mid-1990s that the dam's capacity could be dramatically reduced. By 2006 continual regeneration of the upper Ord catchment appeared to have reduced the amount of sediment inflow. The dam received a Historic Engineering Marker from Engineers Australia as part of its Engineering Heritage Recognition Program. Geography Dam wall Lake Argyle normally has a surface area of about . The storage capacity, to the top of the spillway is . The lake filled to capacity in 1973, and the spillway flowed until 1984. Lake Argyle's usual storage volume is ,Australian Govt. Pub. Service Ord River Irrigation Area review. a joint Commonwealth and Western Australian review. 1979 making it the largest reservoir in Australia. The combined Lake Gordon/Lake Pedder system in Tasmania is larger but is two dams connected by a canal. At maximum flood level, Lake Argyle would hold of water and cover a surface area of . Higher areas have become permanent islands within the lake's area. Irrigation Lake Argyle, together with Lake Kununurra, is part of the Ord River Irrigation Scheme. There are currently some of farmland under irrigation in the East Kimberly region. The original plan was for dam water to irrigate rice crop for export to China. However these plans were scuttled as waterfowl, particularly magpie geese ate rice shoots quicker than they could be planted. Other crops are now grown, but Lake Argyle still remains Australia's most under-utilised lake. Flora and fauna View from downstream viewing the Ord River after it leaves Lake Argyle The damming of the Ord River has caused major changes to the environment. Flows to the Ord River have been severely reduced. Within Lake Argyle itself a thriving new eco-system has developed. The lake is recognised as an important wetland area under the Ramsar Convention; with Lake Kununurra it forms the Lakes Argyle and Kununurra Ramsar Site. The lake is now home to 26 species of native fish and a population of freshwater crocodiles currently estimated at some 25,000. Fish species that are present in Lake Argyle include barramundi, southern saratoga, archer fish, forktail cat fish, mouth almighty, long tom, bony bream and sleepy cod. While the official website states that only incidentally a saltwater crocodile is found, other experts disagree. Cane toads reached the dam in late 2008, mostly via traveling along the Victoria Highway, with numbers rising significantly during the 2009 summer. =Birds= Aerial view at southern end The lake, with its surrounding mudflats and grasslands, has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports about 150,000 waterbirds with twelve species being represented in large enough numbers to be considered internationally significant. The mud flats and grasslands are the natural habitat of eight wader species also represented in internationally significant numbers, along with a healthy population of Australian bustards which are considered a \\"near threatened\\" species. Birds for which the lake has global importance include magpie geese, wandering whistling-ducks, green pygmy-geese, Pacific black ducks, hardheads, black-necked storks, white-headed stilts, red-capped plovers, Oriental plovers, black-fronted dotterels, long-toed stints and sharp-tailed sandpipers. Common larger-bodied bird species found at the lake include the Australian pelican, black swan, eastern great egret, royal spoonbill, osprey and wedge-tailed eagle. Common smaller-bodied bird species include the spinifex pigeon, peaceful dove, common sandpiper, white-winged tern and budgerigar, while mid-sized bird species include the red-winged parrot, blue-winged kookaburra and barking owl. Some threats identified by the IBA include invasive weed and animal species, such as the cane toad, as well as agricultural uses, free range cattle and feral ungulates that may be over- grazing in the shallow areas around the lake. The IBA recommends that a fence be installed in the important shallows in the south and east to prevent all ungulates from entering those lake areas.

This is done specifically to prevent a majority of the Court from controlling the Court's docket. The rule of four is not required by the Constitution, any law, or even the Supreme Court's own published rules. Rather, it is a custom that has been observed since the Court was given discretion over which appeals to hear by the Judiciary Act of 1891, Judiciary Act of 1925 and the Supreme Court Case Selections Act of 1988.Rogers v. Missouri Pac. R. Co., 352 U.S. 521, 529 (1957) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting); U. S. v. Generes, 405 U.S. 93, 115 n.2 (1972) (Douglas, J., dissenting) (discussing history of rule and fact that Congress discussed it at hearings re 1925 Judiciary Act). The \\"Rule of Four\\" has been explained by various Justices in judicial opinions throughout the years.For examples, see Hamilton v. Texas, 498 U.S. 908, 909 n* (1990) (Marshall, J., concurring); Thigpen v. Roberts, 468 U.S. 27, 33 (1984) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting); Texas v. Mead, 465 U.S. 1041, 1042 n.1 (1984) (Opinion of Stevens, J., respecting the denial of certiorari); U. S. v. Generes, 405 U.S. 93, 115 n.2 (1972) (Douglas, J., dissenting). For example, Justice Felix Frankfurter described the rule as follows: \\"The ‘rule of four’ is not a command of Congress. It is a working rule devised by the Court as a practical mode of determining that a case is deserving of review, the theory being that if four Justices find that a legal question of general importance is raised, that is ample proof that the question has such importance. This is a fair enough rule of thumb on the assumption that four Justices find such importance on an individualized screening of the cases sought to be reviewed.\\"Rogers v. Missouri Pac. R. Co., 352 U.S. 521, 529 (1957) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting). Although the Rule of Four in general has remained constant for some time -- i.e., that it takes at least four affirmative votes to grant a petition for certiorari -- the ancillary aspects of it have changed throughout the years and Justices have not always agreed about these aspects.New York v. Uplinger, 467 U.S. 246, 249 (1984) (Stevens, J., concurring) (\\"Although the origins of the Rule of Four are somewhat obscure, its administration during the past 60 years has undergone a number of changes.\\"). A good example is found in dueling opinions (for themselves alone, i.e., not opinions of the Court), in Rogers v. Missouri Pac. R. Co., Justice Frankfurter and Justice John Marshall Harlan II discussed their understandings of the conventions surrounding the Rule of Four.Rogers v. Missouri Pac. Co., 352 U.S. 521, 528 (1957) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting), and id. at 559 (1957) (Harlan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) In particular, the Justices disagreed as to whether, once certiorari having been properly granted by the vote of four Justices, this then required all Justices to rule on the merits of the Petition (rather than vote to dismiss it). Justice Frankfurter did not agree that Justices were required to reach the merits of a petition, even if properly granted, but Justice Harlan disagreed. Justice Harlan felt that even if he disagreed with a grant of certiorari, the Rule of Four \\"requires that once certiorari has been granted a case should be disposed of on the premise that it is properly heard, in the absence of considerations appearing which were not manifest or fully apprehended at the time certiorari was granted.\\"Id. at 559 (Harlan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).

The possibilities are termed the horns of the dilemma, a clichéd usage, but distinguishing the dilemma from other kinds of predicament as a matter of usage. Terminology The term dilemma is attributed by Gabriel Nuchelmans to Lorenzo Valla in the 15th century, in later versions of his logic text traditionally called Dialectica. Valla claimed that it was the appropriate Latin equivalent of the Greek dilemmaton. Nuchelmans argued that his probable source was a logic text of c.1433 of George of Trebizond. He also concluded that Valla had reintroduced to the Latin West a type of argument that had fallen into disuse. Valla's neologism did not immediately take hold, preference being given to the established Latin term complexio, used by Cicero, with conversio applied to the upsetting of dilemmatic reasoning. With the support of Juan Luis Vives, however, dilemma was widely applied by the end of the 16th century. In the form \\"you must accept either A, or B\\" — here A and B are propositions each leading to some further conclusion — and applied incorrectly, the dilemma constitutes a false dichotomy, that is, a fallacy. Traditional usage distinguished the dilemma as a \\"horned syllogism\\" from the sophism that attracted the Latin name cornutus. The original use of the word horns in English has been attributed to Nicholas Udall in his 1548 book Paraphrases, translating from the Latin term cornuta interrogatio. Dilemmatic arguments The dilemma is sometimes used as a rhetorical device. Its isolation as textbook material has been attributed to Hermogenes of Tarsus in his work On Invention.Lucia Calboli Montefusco, Rhetorical use of dilemmatic arguments, Rhetorica: A Journal of the History of Rhetoric Vol. 28, No. 4 (Autumn 2010), pp. 363–383, at p. 364. Published by: University of California Press on behalf of the International Society for the History of Rhetoric. DOI: 10.1525/rh.2010.28.4.363 C. S. Peirce gave a definition of dilemmatic argument as any argument relying on excluded middle. =In logic= In propositional logic, dilemma is applied to a group of rules of inference, which are in themselves valid rather than fallacious. They each have three premises, and include the constructive dilemma and destructive dilemma. Such arguments can be refuted by showing that the disjunctive premise — the \\"horns of the dilemma\\" — does not in fact hold, because it presents a false dichotomy. You are asked to accept \\"A or B\\", but counter by showing that is not all. Successfully undermining that premise is called \\"escaping through the horns of the dilemma\\". =In philosophy= Dilemmatic reasoning has been attributed to Melissus of Samos, a Presocratic philosopher whose works survive in fragmentary form, making the origins of the technique in philosophy imponderable. It was established with Diodorus Cronus (died c. 284 BCE). The paradoxes of Zeno of Elea were reported by Aristotle in dilemma form, but that may have been to conform with what Plato said about Zeno's style. =Moral and ethical dilemmas= In cases where two moral principles appear to be inconsistent, an actor confronts a dilemma in terms of which principle to follow. This kind of moral case study is attributed to Cicero, in book III of his De Officiis. In the Christian tradition of casuistry, an approach to abstract ranking of principles introduced by Bartolomé de Medina in the 16th century became tainted with the accusation of laxism, as did casuistry itself. Another approach, with legal roots, is to lay emphasis on particular features present in a given case: in other words, the exact framing of the dilemma. = In law = In law, Valentin Jeutner has argued that the term \\"legal dilemma\\" could be used as a term-of-art, to describe a situation where a legal subject is confronted with two or more legal norms that the legal subject cannot simultaneously comply with.Birkenkötter, Hannah, Valentin Jeutner: Irresolvable Norm Conflicts in International Law: The Concept of a Legal Dilemma, 28 (2017) European Journal of International Law 1415-1428. Examples include contradictory contracts where one clause directly negates another clause, or conflicts between fundamental (e.g. constitutional) legal norms. Leibniz's 1666 doctoral dissertation De casibus perplexis (Perplexing Cases) is an early study of contradictory legal conditions.Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm, \\"Inaugural Dissertation on Perplexing Cases in the Law\\" in Alberto Artosi, Bernardo Pieri, and Giovanni Sartor (eds.), Leibniz: Logico- Philosophical Puzzles in the Law (Springer 2013). In domestic law, it has been argued that the German Constitutional Court confronted a legal dilemma when determining, in connection with proceedings relating to the German Aviation Security Act, whether a government official could intentionally kill innocent civilians by shooting down a hijacked airplane that would otherwise have crashed into a football stadium, killing tens of thousands.Jeutner, Valentin (2017), Irresolvable Norm Conflicts in International Law: The Concept of a Legal Dilemma, Oxford University Press, p. 15, 72. See also Michael Bohlander, ‘Of Shipwrecked Sailors, Unborn Children, Conjoined Twins and Hijacked Airplanes—Taking Human Life and the Defence of Necessity’ (2006) 70 The Journal of Criminal Law 147. In international law, it has been suggested that the International Court of Justice confronted a legal dilemma in its 1996 Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion. It was faced with the question whether, in an extreme circumstance of self-defence, it is a state's right to self-defence or international law's general prohibition of nuclear weapons that should take priority.Jeutner, Valentin (2017), Irresolvable Norm Conflicts in International Law: The Concept of a Legal Dilemma, Oxford University Press, p. 10-11.

The area is perhaps best known to be the home of the distinguished Recoleta Cemetery. It is also relatively affluent, with some of the priciest real estate in the city. The neighborhood is served by Line D and Line H of the Buenos Aires Underground.  Geographical location  Southwestward view of Recoleta in 2014, overlooking Floralis Genérica and the National Library. The Recoleta neighborhood is composed of the area limited by Montevideo and Uruguay Streets, Córdoba Avenue, Mario Bravo and Coronel Díaz Streets, Las Heras Avenue, Tagle Street, the F.G.B.M railway, Jerónimo Salguero Street, and by the Río de La Plata or River Plate. Neighboring communities are Retiro to the southeast, San Nicolás, Balvanera and Almagro to the south, and Palermo to the northwest, and the River Plate to the northeast.  History  Recoleta Plaza in 1867: the Recoleta Cemetery and the Church of Nuestra Señora del Pilar. The name of the neighborhood comes from the monastery – the Recollect Convent () – of the Recollect fathers, members of the Franciscan Order, which was established in the area at the beginning of the 18th century. They founded a monastery and a church dedicated to Nuestra Señora del Pilar with a cemetery attached. The Recoleta pathway is nearly the exact geographic center of the neighborhood, and one of its highest points in the city, which, at the end of the 19th century attracted wealthy families from the south of the city who sought to escape from the deadly yellow fever outbreak which began in 1871. From that time on, the Recoleta has been one of the most stylish and expensive neighborhoods in Buenos Aires, home to private family mansions, foreign embassies, and luxury hotels, including the Alvear Palace Hotel. The historical center of the neighborhood is the Church of Nuestra Señora del Pilar, construction of which was completed in 1732. For that reason, the neighborhood was occasionally called El Pilar. The church was originally situated at the edge of the banks that sloped down to the Río de la Plata and Manso Creek. The creek, also known as Tercero del Norte, currently flows through an underground pipe, and runs below present-day Pueyrredón Avenue. It formed a type of small delta, with channels along the current Austria and Tagle Streets, which flowed into the Río de la Plata. The Recoleta train station in 1904. The rail line would be later deactivated and the station demolished. When Buenos Aires suffered terrible cholera and yellow fever epidemics in the 1870s, the population of the city spread out to avoid the contagion. It was for that reason that, while the underprivileged classes settled in the south-southwest of the city, the most wealthy settled in the Recoleta area, where the height of the terrain reduced the presence of insects which transmitted the diseases. These families (many of which were members of the ruling national elite, considered of \\"noble\\" ancestry (although there were no noblemen in the former Hispanic territories) for having descended from respected historical figures from the period of Argentine independence), built mansions and other notable buildings in several European architectural styles of the period (many of which were demolished towards the end of the 1950s and beginning of the 1960s and once again during the 2000s). Consequently, Buenos Aires has often been referred to as the \\"Paris of South America\\". Nowadays, what is left of these traditional buildings coexist with elegant modern constructions. Together with some sections of the neighboring communities of Retiro and Palermo, Recoleta forms a part of the area known as Barrio Norte, Buenos Aires, a traditional residential zone for the city’s most affluent families, where a great portion of the cultural life of the city is concentrated.  Culture  Church of Nuestra Señora del Pilar. The Recoleta neighborhood is distinguished by its great cultural spaces. In addition to historical monuments, it is home to the National Fine Arts Museum or Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, the National Library of Argentina, the Recoleta Cultural Center, and other exhibition venues. = Recoleta Cemetery = Recoleta Cemetery. The Recoleta Cemetery is one of the main tourist attractions in the neighborhood. It was designed by the French architect Prosper Catelin, at the request of President Bernardino Rivadavia, and was dedicated in 1822. = Museums and cultural centers = Next to the cemetery is the former General Juan José Viamonte Shelter, administered in the past by the Recollect Fathers. When it ceased functioning as a shelter for the indigent, it was acquired by the city and converted into the Centro Cultural Recoleta, one of the most important exhibition halls for the plastic arts in the city. 150 meters away, across Libertador Avenue, is the el Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes (MNBA), which holds in its permanent collection works of art by Argentine artists such as Berni and Seguí, as well as works by European masters such as Titian, Goya, Rembrandt, Gauguin, and Manet. To the east, along Posadas Street, is the Palais de Glace, which was, at the beginning of the twentieth century, an ice skating rink. It has since been turned into a multimedia exhibition center. Behind Carlos Thays Park is located the Centro Municipal de Exposiciones, which houses a wide variety of exhibitions and cultural events. = Education = The National Library of Argentina Several of the oldest and most prestigious schools in the capital are in the Recoleta neighborhood. Among them are the Escuela Superior de Comercio Carlos Pellegrini, the Escuela Argentina Modelo, the Scuola Edmundo de Amicis, the Colegio Champagnat, the Colegio Mallinkdrodt, the and Normal School 1, the oldest portion of which has been declared a National Monument. Many university schools are also found in Recoleta: Derecho (University of Buenos Aires School of Law), Medicina (University of Buenos Aires School of Medicine), Odontología (University of Buenos Aires School of Dentistry), and the Farmacia y Bioquímica (University of Buenos Aires Schools of Pharmacy and Biochemistry). Additionally, the neogothic style building which formerly held the University of Buenos Aires’ School of Engineering can be found on Las Heras Avenue, although today it serves only as an auxiliary building for the School, characterized by the cold, humid air typical of gothic structures. A construction in the brutalist style, located on Agüero Street between Libertador Avenue and Las Heras, is home to the new National Library of Argentina. The building was completed in 1992, after 20 years of construction work. It contains more than four million volumes, including twenty priceless editions, such as a rare copy of Dante’s Divine Comedy. = Recoleta and tango = Several cabarets in the neighborhood served as locales for tango music and dance. The Pabellón de las Rosas, on Libertador Avenue and Tagle Street, like the Café de Hansen in the Palermo neighborhood, maintained a Belle Époque atmosphere, where the so-called atorrantes (\\"vagabonds\\", but also \\"scoundrels\\", \\"spoiled brats\\") spent their evenings. At this, and at other cabarets such as the Armenonville, a \\"peringundín\\" (\\"dance hall\\") where Carlos Gardel was known to appear, fights—occasionally bloody—would break out between \\"malevos\\" (\\"ruffians\\"), \\"compadritos\\" (\\"tough-guys\\") and \\"jailaifes\\" (\\"high- lifes” or high society boys) according to the florid contemporary slang (lunfardo). In the 1910s, when the Palais de Glace no longer served as an ice skating rink, it became a dance venue, and it is there where the tango finally became accepted by the upper classes of Buenos Aires, especially since it had already become a fad in Paris. Many tango lyrics reflect life in the Recoleta neighborhood. One song, by Horacio Ferrer, set to music by Ástor Piazzolla, is the \\"Balada para un loco\\" (\\"Ballad for a Madman\\"), which cites two of the neighborhood streets, Callao and Arenales: \\"Salís de tu casa por Arenales... / Ya sé que estoy piantao, piantao, piantao... / ¿No ves que va la Luna rodando por Callao,/ que un corso de astronautas y niños, con un vals,/ me baila alrededor...?\\" (You leave home down Arenales ... / I know I'm mad, mad, mad../ don't you see the moon rolling down Callao? / how a carnival of astronauts and children /dance a vals around me...?\\")  Sculpture  The neighborhood has numerous statues and sculptures in its parks and plazas. It has been exaggerated that the Recoleta neighborhood has more statues than any neighborhood in the world. Among the statues that stand out are El último centauro (\\"The Last Centaur\\"), El Arquero (\\"The Archer\\") and the equestrian statue dedicated to Carlos María de Alvear. Additionally, there are works by the sculptor Antoine Bourdelle, the Floralis Genérica by Eduardo Catalano, and the Torso Masculino Desnudo (\\"Nude Male Torso\\") by Fernando Botero. The Recoleta Cemetery also possesses many exquisite works of art, obscured by their funerary location: the sculpture known as the Cristo Muerto by Giulio Monteverde, for example. Furthermore, the neighboring Basilica of Nuestra Señora del Pilar holds examples of Spanish Colonial art. Particularly noteworthy is a sculpture which represents one of the Apostles by the Spanish sculptor, Alonso Cano.  Architecture  Calle Junín, at the heart of the Recoleta neighborhood From the end of the nineteenth-century to the start of the 1920s, the Recoleta neighborhood has witnessed the construction of a great number of “châteaux” (often imitating those of the Loire valley in France), as well as Parisian style petits hôtels, almost always designed by architects of French origin. The major portion of the building materials (boiseries, slate roof tiles, marble for staircases, bronze and iron work, chandeliers with lead crystal prisms, glass lamp shades, ornate gilded mirrors, and beveled lead crystal window panes, mosaics, etc.) were brought from Europe. But just as it occurred in other neighborhoods of Buenos Aires, these grand buildings, in large part, have been demolished since the 1960s due to the realities of the real estate market: on the land that held an extraordinary private mansion, several ordinary modern buildings could be erected. Currently several neighborhood groups which organize marches, meetings, and other events are working to halt further destruction of existing landmarks. Palacio Duhau. In spite of the demolitions, Recoleta still displays a rich architectural legacy. Outstanding examples are on Alvear Avenue, where such buildings as the Palacio Duhau (former property of the Duhau family), the Nunciature of the Vatican (the Fernández Anchorena Palace), the French Embassy (former Ortiz Basualdo Palace), the Brazilian Embassy (former Pereda Palace), the Jockey Club, and the luxurious Alvear Palace Hotel. All over Recoleta, petits hôtels which contrast with larger and more modern apartment buildings, still grace the neighborhood. Some of the work of the noteworthy architect, Clorindo Testa, is in Recoleta. Of importance is the National Library, the Buenos Aires Design center, and the building of the new Colegio de Escribanos de Buenos Aires (School of Legal Notaries of Buenos Aires) on Las Heras Avenue. Additionally, on the side streets of the neighborhood, there is a large number of rental properties of more practical design, whose compact structure and austere appearance contrast with the predominantly neoclassic style of much of Recoleta. One particular area of Recoleta, bounded by Agüero, Córdoba, Mario Bravo, Soler, Sánchez de Bustamante, and Mansilla streets, is not normally considered to be a part of the Recoleta neighborhood, but rather belonging to the Palermo area. This may be due to fact that it displays a more recent design style than the average area of Recoleta, and of a visibly inferior quality of construction. For that reason, it is one of the more economical areas of the neighborhood, although some residents may not realize that they do in fact reside in Recoleta. Dr. Ricardo Gutiérrez Children’s Hospital. Unlike other areas of Recoleta, the only historic structure in this particular portion of the neighborhood is the Ricardo Gutiérrez Children’s Hospital. The main wing of this hospital retains the features that it had a century ago, and it is located on the corner of Paraguay and Gallo Streets.  Green spaces  Although a large portion of Recoleta has been developed, it still possesses many green spaces. Along Libertador and Figueroa Alcorta Avenues, the República Federativa do Brasil Park is located facing the University of Buenos Aires School of Law, Plaza Rubén Darío, Plaza República Oriental del Uruguay, Plaza República Chile, Plaza Francia, Plaza Intendente Alvear, Plaza Dante Alighieri and Plazoleta Raúl Soldi. Plaza Vicente López y Planes, recently enhanced, is found at the intersection of Montevideo and Paraná Streets. Recoleta was the site of an amusement park, Italpark, from 1960 until its closure in 1990. The current Parque Thays stands on the land that it once occupied. Along Córdoba Avenue, the western edge of the neighborhood, are two parks: Plaza Bernardo Houssay, filled with university students, artisans, and resellers of academic textbooks, and Plaza Monseñor De Andrea, at the intersection of Córdoba and Jean Jaurés Street, is a neighborhood area distinctive for its more everyday feel, where petits-hotels and grand buildings leave space for small homes, grocery stores and shops. Of particular note, in the Plaza Francia facing the cemetery is an enormous rubber tree; its huge tentacle-like lower branches cast shade over La Biela's popular terrace. Known as the Gran Gomero, it was planted in 1791 by Martín José Altolaguirre, the owner of these lands back in that time, and is 50 meters wide. = Plaza Francia = View of the northern portion of Plaza Francia Facing the cemetery and the cultural center, is the Plaza Intendente Alvear, mistakenly, but commonly known as Plaza Francia. The plaza became famous in the 1960s for its street fair, popularly called the “feria hippie.” Over time, in addition to genuine artisans and craftspeople, the fair has attracted street vendors and merchants of a wide variety of merchandise. At present, the Government of the City of Buenos Aires has reorganized the fair, encouraging the participation of those artisans whose work is original and authentic, and discouraging those whose merchandise is of low quality or those who simply sell mass-produced items. The artisans, led by the organization, Interferias, must pass an evaluation process and be registered. Visitors to the fair may find all kinds of handicraft items, many of them of high quality: leather goods, book restoration, sandals and espadrilles, carved mates, ethnic jewelry, incense, essential oils, spices, satchels, candles, indigenous musical instruments, photography, and much more.  Famous residents of Recoleta  Of the important residents of the Recoleta neighborhood, the writers Adolfo Bioy Casares and Silvina Ocampo stand out. Perhaps even better known is Jorge Luis Borges, who lived on Quintana Avenue and was, for many years, the Director of the Biblioteca Nacional. He is, arguably, the single most influential and world-renowned Argentine writer. José Ortega y Gasset also lived for a time on Quintana Avenue. In the 1930s, Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli, later known to the world as Pope Pius XII, lived in a sumptuous residence on Alvear Avenue. The American actor Guy Williams lived and died in the neighborhood. In the past, the Argentine president’s residence was located at the intersection of Agüero Street and Libertador Avenue. After the overthrow of President Juan Perón in 1955, the luxurious residence was demolished, and today, where it stood, now stands the National Library, work of the Italo-Argentine Clorindo Testa. Other contemporary residents who have lent local color to the neighborhood are the comedian Carlos Balá, the iconoclastic musician Charly García and the Italian- Argentine designer Gino Bogani.  Businesses and restaurants  Buenos Aires Design, commercial center dedicated exclusively to décor and design. Home, as well, to the Hard Rock Cafe. The neighborhood is well known for its shopping opportunities. The most important French and Italian designers have shops in Recoleta. Recoleta is also a distinctive gastronomic area of the city. Its restaurants, many having earned international awards, are located along Ortiz Street, closed to motor traffic. Here, the renowned chef Gato Dumas has had several restaurants. A classic in the neighborhood, and the preferred locale of the Buenos Aires cultural elite, is the literary café, Clásica y Moderna, located on Callao Avenue at Paraguay Street. \\"La Biela\\" Café-Bar on the corner of Quintana and Ortiz, is a place that represents the area well.

Some lines of The Promise Key were taken verbatim from the Royal Parchment Scroll of Black Supremacy; for example, the slogan \\"Gross beauty is the Queen in hell\\" may be found in both works, as part of a general condemnation of western aesthetics.

She became famous as a young adult when a company dedicated to the transport of disabled people began to sponsor her father's wheelchair-accessible hot air balloon, which was named after her. Background Waldman suffered severe complications during birth, including not breathing for nearly 21 minutes. She spent an extended stay in hospital after birth, followed by a period of therapies and multiple medical visits. Her father, Gary Waldman, received an invitation by Phil Gray, a friend and hot air balloon pilot, to take a ride in a hot air balloon in 1986. Waldman decided to take his then two-year-old daughter along with him. Unexpectedly to the balloon's riders, Serena reacted to the balloon ride in a positive way. This prompted her father to open a service where he could try to give the same experience to other disabled children.Chicago Tribune Sep 18, 2005 link Her father acquired a hot air balloon of his own, naming it \\"Serena's Song\\", after his daughter. It is believed to be the first hot air balloon in the world to be specially modified so that people in wheelchairs can fly in it. Financing the service proved to be hard. At first, Waldman funded the service with his own money as well as money from family and friends. However, the cost of flying the balloon each time, which involved purchasing fuel and flying permits was proving too high for them to keep up with. In the following months, Gary Waldman contacted several newspapers, in an attempt to find someone who could sponsor the trips. Expensive as it was to fly the balloon, Serena and her father continued to travel across the United States to fairs and other events, where they could give disabled people the experience of flying in a hot air balloon. Their story became nationally known, as many television channels and other types of media covered them. Their story came to be noticed by the ATC (now a part of Transdev), a company dedicated to the ground transport of disabled people by using public transportation buses under their name. Jim Long, president of ATC, decided that his company would sponsor the \\"Serena's Song\\" balloon. Veolia still sponsors the hot air balloon, which tours the United States with the single goal of letting disabled people, their loved ones, friends and caretakers experience flying by hot air balloon. ATC also dedicated one of their buses to Serena Waldman, naming it \\"Serena's Song\\" as well. The bus was duplicated with many toy and memorabilia models, such as a toy plush van.

Such vehicles can corner without rolling over despite having a narrow axle track because they can balance some or all of the roll moment caused by centripetal acceleration with an opposite roll moment caused by gravity, as bicycles and motorcycles do. This also reduces the lateral acceleration experienced by the rider, which some find more comfortable than the alternative. The narrow profile can result in reduced aerodynamic drag and increased fuel efficiency. These types of vehicles have also been described as \\"man-wide vehicles\\" (MWV). As with tricycles that do not tilt, there are a variety of feasible choices of how the wheels are arranged, which wheels are steered, and which wheels are driven. In addition, there are a variety of feasible choices for which wheels tilt and which do not. Terminology Because this is an emerging field with many different vehicle configurations, many different individual contributors, and not yet any clearly dominant technology, there is a great deal of potentially confusing terminology in use: *tilt, lean, and roll are all used somewhat interchangeably, depending on the context and the writer, usually to mean rotation about a longitudinal axis of the vehicle. *stable and stability are usually used in this context to characterize whether the vehicle tilts, leans, or rolls as the rider wishes. As with directional stability, a vehicle is considered stable about its longitudinal axis if it returns to the vertical/ straight orientation hands free, and unstable if it does not. The stability of a vehicle may vary with its forward speed, and the stability might be inherent in the vehicle or created by the rider or some other active controller. For example, bicycles exhibit no stability when stationary, they simply fall over, but can exhibit self-stability if rolling forward at the right speed, even without a rider. Meanwhile, active tilters exhibit roll stability at all times and are designed not to rollover in a turn. Tilting vehicles may exhibit nearly any combination of the above behaviors, due to any combination of their geometry, mass distribution, suspension characteristics, rider input, or some other active control system. *active, passive, and free usually refer to how the tilt angle is controlled, directly or indirectly. \\"Active\\" control usually requires some sensor(s), some capacity to calculate a response, such as a feedback controller, and some actuator(s) that require power sources. \\"Passive\\" control and \\"free\\" control mean there are no sensors, comparisons, response calculation, or actuators and the vehicle is controlled as a bicycle or motorcycle \\"Free\\" and \\"passive\\" usually mean that the vehicle tilts as a bicycle or motorcycle, and the rider must control the tilt angle indirectly by steering the vehicle. *direct and indirect usually refer to how active control is applied. The rider on a \\"free-tilting\\" and \\"passive-tilting\\" trike usually can apply a steer torque directly, which then controls the tilt angle indirectly, as on bicycles and motorcycles. The rider on a \\"free-to-caster\\" trike, on the other hand, can apply a roll torque directly, which then controls the steer angle indirectly. *highside and lowside are expressions already commonly used in the motorcycle world to describe ways in which the bodies of these vehicles may collide with the ground. Benefits and drawbacks The potential benefits of tilting, compared to the rigid alternative, include: *The ability to balance the moment caused by lateral acceleration in a turn, due to high speed, tight radius, or both, with a counter moment caused by gravity, means these vehicles do not have to be low, wide, and/or slow. Also, since stability no longer depends on the axle track, the center of mass does not have to be located near the wide axle and instead can be located anywhere between the front and rear axle to optimize other performance characteristics such as ride quality or braking performance. *Leaning into a turn, as bicycles and motorcycles do, means that the net acceleration experienced by the vehicle and rider can always be aligned with the midplane of the vehicle. Riders may find this more pleasant than the alternative, and vehicle components, such as the frame, wheels, and tires, can avoid large side loads. *A narrow axle track means that the vehicle does not require as much pavement and may experience less aerodynamic drag because of a smaller cross-sectional area. *Depending on how the tilting is implemented, a tilting vehicle can be oriented independent of cross slope, such as from the crown in a road or a soft shoulder. The drawbacks of tilting, compared to the rigid alternative, include: *The tilting mechanism, free or controlled, requires more constructive elements compared to two-wheeled (motor-) cycles, while independent suspension of rigid three-wheelers may be more complex *Control of the tilting either requires some kind of automated control system or different behavior from the rider, such as countersteering. ConfigurationsWheel layout= As with tricycles in general, the two main wheel layouts are: *delta, with one wheel in front and two wheels in back. Notable examples include the Ariel 3, MEV Tilting Trike, Honda Canopy, Vandenbrink Carver, and CLEVER. *tadpole, with two wheels in front and one wheel in back. Notable examples include the Piaggio MP3, Yamaha Tricity, and Toyota i-Road. Twinned Wheel Rule: In many countries aligned to EU regulations, an arrangement of two wheels on the same axle [not necessarily maintained co-axial], is treated as one wheel provided they are spaced no further apart than between contact patch centers. This has the effect of allowing vehicles complying with this dimensional limit to be classified as motorcycles. Therefore, such vehicles would be subject to all the technical prescriptions applicable to motorcycles rather than motorised tricycles or four-wheeled vehicles. =Steered wheels= Rear-wheel steering tends to be directionally unstable, and so the vast majority of trikes employ front-wheel steering. A notable exception is the Toyota i-Road. In the case of two wheel steering, some accommodation is usually made to account for the different radii of their paths, such as Ackermann steering geometry. =Driven wheels= Either the front or rear wheel(s) may be driven, but driving a wheel near its power source is usually simpler than driving a wheel at the other end of the vehicle, driving a single wheel is usually simpler than driving a pair of wheels, and driving a wheel that remains aligned with its power source is simpler than driving a wheel that tilts or steers relative to its power source. Two common drive configurations are: *Drive two non-tilting wheels in the rear. Notable examples include the Ariel 3, MEV Tilting Trike, Honda Canopy, Vandenbrink Carver, and CLEVER. *Drive one tilting wheel in the rear. Notable examples include the Piaggio MP3, Yamaha Tricity, and Toyota i-Road. Less common drive configurations include: *Drive two tilting wheels in the rear. *Drive one tilting wheel in the front. One example is the Rose-Hulman Ragnarök pictured below. =Seating= As with tricycles in general, seating may be upright, as on the Piaggio MP3, or recumbent, as on the MEV Tilting Trike. If the vehicle is designed to accommodate a second rider, the seating is usually arranged in tandem to maintain the narrow profile, as on the CLEVER. =Enclosure= The rider may be fully exposed, as on the Tripendo, behind a fairing or windscreen, as on the Piaggio MP3, under a canopy, as on the Honda Canopy, or fully enclosed, as on the Vandenbrink Carver. =Power= Power may come from the rider, as on the Tripendo, from batteries and electric motors, as on the Toyota i-Road, or from conventional internal combustion engines, as on the Yamaha Tricity. Tilting Any number of the wheels can tilt, and advantages to tilting wheels are that the wheels do not need to bear large side loads, and the tires mounted on them can generate camber thrust, which can reduce the need for a slip angle to generate cornering force. Configurations include: *One wheel in front and only the front tilts, referred to as 1F1T (i.e. one front one tilts). Notable examples include the Ariel 3, MEV Tilting Trike, Honda Canopy, Vandenbrink Carver, and CLEVER. *One wheel in front and all three wheels tilt, referred to as 1F3T (i.e. one front three tilt). An example can be seen in the Rose-Hulman Ragnarök pictured below and the UWM PantherTrike pictured above. *Two wheels in front and only the single rear wheel tilts, referred to as 2F1T (i.e. two front one tilt). *Two wheels in front and all three wheels tilt, referred to as 2F3T (i.e. two front three tilt). Notable examples include the Piaggio MP3, Yamaha Tricity, and Toyota i-Road. In the case where the two side-by-side wheels tilt, some mechanical linkage is necessary to coordinate their tilting. Implementations include: * Some form of one or more parallelograms, such as on the Tripendo pictured above and the Mercedes-Benz F300 Life Jet Concept Vehicle pictured below. This has been employed on tadpole and delta trike configurations. * Some form a pair of swingarms, possibly connected by some form of bell crank. This tends to be employed on delta trike configurations. * Some form of crank, in which case the two wheels are not directly side-by-side. This tends to be employed on delta trike configurations. * Some form of coordination between parallel telescopic forks, as on the Yamaha MWT-9 pictured above and the Yamaha Niken pictured below. Due to the tilting, there is not necessarily any side-to-side load transfer between the wheels in cornering, so the rule of thumb about tadpoles understeering and deltas oversteering does not necessarily apply. If the tilting mechanism has some limitation on tilt angle, then the lateral acceleration the vehicle can experience without rolling over will be a function of maximum tilt angle possible, axle track, and center of mass location. =Free, passive, or active tilt control= * Free tilting and passive tilting vehicles are controlled as with a bicycle or motorcycle, in which case countersteering is required. Actively controlled tilters are where the rider or some other controller actively sets the tilt angle directly. Vehicles for which the rider has direct control over the tilt angle include the General Motors Lean Machine, in which the rider controlled tilt with foot pedals, and the Tripendo, in which the rider controls tilt by hand with a lever. An active controller may calculate a desired tilt angle from some combination of lateral acceleration and steering input, and it may set a desired tilt angle with some combination of mechanical, electrical, or hydraulic actuators. * Free-tilting/ passive -tilting vehicles possess no stability about their roll axis when stationary. To remedy this problem some free/ passive tilters use tilt locks or restraints when at low speeds. Some use a brake applied to the tilting mechanism, some use progressive roll stability adjustments. Free/passive tilters possess self stability when moving forward with sufficient traction, as with bicycles and motorcycles, and if traction is lost the vehicle will likely lowside. The lateral spacing of the wheels does not avoid tipping over, these vehicles behave and are controlled like single track vehicles. * Active-tilt vehicles are designed to possess roll stability at all times when stopped or in motion, and if traction is lost, the vehicles will not lowside. In these vehicles the lateral spacing of the wheel set is put to effective use to create additional stability. In all cases, the tilting mechanism may simply be lockable to facilitate keeping the vehicle upright when stopped or parked. Also, passive or active tilting systems cannot simply counter the roll moment caused by gravity, as this has been shown to make a vehicle practically unsteerable, although there is ongoing debate about whether it is truly unsteerable or not. =Enclosures= Enclosures can protect rider(s) from the weather and allow for reduced aerodynamic drag. * Unenclosed vehicles may employ free or passive tilt control because the rider can still put a foot down when stopped. The rider is responsible for controlling tilt just as they would on a two-wheeled bicycle or motorcycle. * Enclosed vehicles, in which the rider cannot reach the ground, must provide come kind of active tilt control, either automatic or by the rider, to keep the vehicle upright when stopped. Steering Steering requires that the axle(s) of the front wheel(s) form a finite angle with the axle(s) of the rear wheel(s), i.e. not be parallel. This misalignment may be accomplished in a variety of ways, and usually the front wheel(s) rotate about a steering axis relative to the rest of the vehicle and the rear wheel(s). One notable exception, already mentioned above, is the rear-wheel-steered Toyota i-Road. =Countersteering= Some Tilting trikes are forced-tilted, such as the Carver, where the countersteering is not controlled by the operator. Some versions of the model introduced automatic countersteer to increase tilt speed and reduce the force required to tilt the vehicle. Other forced-tilted vehicles may incorporate automatic countersteering. A prototype tilting multi- track free leaning vehicle was developed in 1984 that employs automatic countersteering and does not require any balancing skills. A larger range of tilting three-wheelers has appeared in the recent years and use manually controlled countersteering like a motorbike, such as the Piaggio MP3 or Yamaha Niken. =Free to castor= One vehicle variation is to control the steered wheel(s) indirectly by tilting them, along with the vehicle body, and this system is known as free to castor [FTC]. The directional control of a FTC wheel is not particularly strong, as demonstrated by the wheels on a shopping cart, and the castored wheel(s) will turn due to any applied side loading. If the steering axis is not vertical, however, the directional stability above about is very strongly controlled by the dynamic forces. If the castored wheel is attached to the front of a narrow tilting vehicle the castor will automatically place itself on the correct steer angle for the tilt and the speed of the vehicle. A system can be used below to improve slow-speed performance where the steerable wheel(s) are progressively captured to the vehicle tilt action as vehicle speed decreases.

Subsequently, a survey of European universities placed Denmark 21 out of 23 European countries with regards to the protection of academic freedom. DM (Dansk Magisterforening) has submitted a complaint to UNESCO that this fails to comply with the 1997 UNESCO Recommendation concerning the Status of Higher-Education Teaching Personnel, which the Danish Government has signed. The reforms have resulted in declining efficiency, where the yearly expenses of Danish Universities towards administration have increased by a sum of 700 million DKR, while most researchers report having less time to do research. As of November 2008, close to 50% of Danish researchers have signed a petition asking for improvement in working conditions and the protection of academic freedom. Theoretical biologist and philosopher Claus Emmeche was one of the organizers of the petition and was surprised with the ease at which the petition gained a large amount of support.Ard Jongsma, \\"DENMARK: Academics sign up to protest\\", University World News, No. 0042, 31 Aug. 2008.

Antelope Island, with an area of 42 square miles (109 km2), is the largest of ten islands located within the Great Salt Lake, Utah, United States. The island lies in the southeastern portion of the lake, near Salt Lake City and Davis County, and becomes a peninsula when the lake is at extremely low levels. It is protected as Antelope Island State Park. The first known non-natives to visit the island were John C. Frémont and Kit Carson during exploration of the Great Salt Lake in 1845, who \\"rode on horseback over salt from the thickness of a wafer to twelve inches\\" and \\"were informed by the Indians that there was an abundance of fresh water on it and plenty of antelope\\".Carson, K., Autobiography, 1935, Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, , p.89 It is said they shot a pronghorn antelope on the island and in gratitude for the meat they named it Antelope Island. Antelope Island has natural scenic beauty and holds populations of pronghorn, bighorn sheep, American bison, porcupine, badger, coyote, bobcat, mule deer, and millions of waterfowl. The bison were introduced to the island in 1893, and Antelope Island bison herd has proven to be a valuable genetic pool for bison breeding and conservation purposes. The bison do well, because much of the island is covered by dry, native grassland. The geology of Antelope Island consists mostly of alluvial plains with prairie grassland on the north, east and south of the island, along with a mountainous central area of older Precambrian metamorphic and igneous rocks and late Precambrian to Paleozoic sedimentary rocks, covered by a thin layer of Quaternary lake deposits, colluvium and alluvium.physiography The Precambrian deposits on Antelope Island are some of the oldest rocks in the United States, older even than the Precambrian rocks at the bottom of the Grand Canyon.  State Park  Antelope Island, c. 1875–1890. Photo by Charles Roscoe Savage. Antelope Island State Park is a Utah state park and the entire island is included in the park. Early in the 20th Century, because of its wildlife and scenic beauty, some suggested that Antelope Island should become a National Park, but the movement never came to fruition. When the Utah State Parks System was created, proposals were made to turn Antelope Island into Antelope Island State Park and the proposal gradually gathered public support, but Antelope Island was privately owned at the time. Originally, Antelope Island was used as a ranch for cattle and sheep, starting from the earliest days of the arrival of the Mormon pioneers into the Salt Lake Valley. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) controlled the ranch on the island from 1848 until approximately 1870. The island was purchased in 1870 by John Dooly, Sr., and he established the Island Improvement Company, which managed the island and ranches from 1884 until 1981. The State of Utah purchased the northern part of the island in 1969, and acquired the remainder in 1981 when the state purchased the historical Fielding Garr Ranch. Subsequently, the cattle and sheep were removed. Antelope Island State Park was established in 1981 as part of the Utah State Parks System. The island is accessible via a 7-mile causeway from Syracuse in Davis County. Access from Interstate 15 is via exit 332,UDOT Milepost Project: Progress Detail I-15 then west along Antelope Drive (SR-108). The island's shore (all but west side of the island) is mostly flat with beaches and plains to the base of the mountains on the island. These steep mountains are visible from most of the northern Wasatch Front, reaching a maximum elevation of , which is about above the level of the lake. Antelope Island State Park operates a 10-watt travelers' information station on 530 kHz AM. The transmitter is on the south side of the causeway near the island. This station can be heard in Ogden and as far south as Salt Lake City. It carries information about the park's hours of operation promotes upcoming events that the state park coordinates.WPWA752 Traveler's Information Station Transmitter Site On the east side of the island, south of the causeway, is the Fielding Garr Ranch. Here is the oldest building in Utah built by European-Americans that is still on its original foundation. Classes are sometimes taught at the ranch and tours are available. During the warmer parts of the year horses are also available for hourly rental at the ranch, and a tour guide can take riders out to observe the bison. Another option available to explore the island are on a tour or rental on electric bikes from the Antelope E-Bikes shop located in the marina parking lot. The southern part of the road to the Fielding Garr Ranch is controlled by a gate that is open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on most days. Antelope Island State Park has approximately 300,000 visitors annually. In 2010 it was the fifth most-visited State Park in Utah.Park Visitation Data  Utah State Parks  History  Native Americans = Archeological evidence dates the earliest habitation of Native Americans in Utah to about 10,000 to 12,000 years ago. Paleolithic people lived near the Great Basin's wetlands, which had an abundance of fish, birds, and small game animals. Big game, including giant bison, mammoths and ground sloths, were also attracted to the water sources. Over the years, the megafauna disappeared, while American bison, mule deer and pronghorn became more predominant. Around 8000 BC, this population was replaced by the Desert Archaic people, who sheltered in caves near the Great Salt Lake. Relying more on gathering than the previous Utah residents, their diet was largely made of cattails and other salt tolerant plants such as pickleweed, burro weed and sedge. Red meat appears to have been a luxury. The Desert Archaic people used nets and the atlatl to hunt water fowl, small animals and pronghorns. Artifacts include nets woven with rabbit skin and plant fibers, gaming sticks, woven sandals, and animal figures made from split-twigs. About 3,500 years ago, lake levels rose and the population of Desert Archaic people appears to have dramatically decreased. Artifacts discovered at Antelope Island State Park show that the island was occupied by prehistoric peoples more than 6,000 years ago. There are forty freshwater springs on Antelope Island. The Fielding Garr Ranch was built near the strongest and most consistent of the springs. Archaeologists have determined that human activity has taken place near these springs for at least 1,000 years. = Fielding Garr Ranch = The first Anglo- Americans to reach the island were John C. Fremont and Kit Carson. They explored Antelope Island in 1845 and named the island for the herds of grazing pronghorn. Captain Howard Stansbury used the island as a base. He mapped the lake and attempted to locate where the waters of the lake drained in an attempt to find a waterway to the Pacific Ocean. The first permanent settler on the island was Fielding Garr. Garr was sent to the island by LDS Church to establish a ranch for the \\"church tithing herds.\\" The Fielding Garr Ranch was owned and operated by the church until the 1870s for the purpose of providing funds for the Perpetual Emigration Fund. This fund financed the immigration of Mormon converts from Europe to Utah. The ranch house, built in 1848, still stands and is the oldest Mormon-built home that is still on its original foundation, in Utah. A view of the ranch The building of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869 opened the rest of the island to settlement by homesteaders. The first federal surveys of the island revealed that only the area surrounding the Fielding Garr Ranch had been improved. This discovery gave the Federal Government the authority to open the island to settlement under the Homestead Act. Settlement on the island was unsuccessful and by 1900 most of the settlers had not improved their claims and, except for the ranch, the island was free of human habitation. John Dooly Sr. purchased the island for one million dollars and established the Island Improvement Company. Dooly is responsible for the introduction of the bison, and the foundation of the Antelope Island bison herd. He brought twelve bison to the island. Four bulls, four cows, and four calves were transported by boat on February 15, 1893. At the time there were fewer than 1,000 head of bison in all of North America. Historians speculate that Dooly introduced the herd to the island for commercial purposes with the idea of establishing a rare opportunity for hunters to take the nearly extinct American bison. The twelve bison became the foundation of the Antelope Island bison herd that numbers between 500-700 animals, making it one of the largest and oldest publicly owned American bison herds in the United States. An old Dodge pick up truck is a reminder of the days when Antelope Island State Park was an active ranch. John Dooly Jr. assumed responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the ranch in about 1902. He focusing on raising sheep. The Fielding Garr Ranch became one of the most industrialized and largest sheep ranching operations in the western United States. A failing wool market in the 1950s caused a shift in focus on the ranch. Sheep were dropped in favor of cattle. The cattle ranch worked as one of the largest cattle operations in Utah until 1984 when the ranch was sold to the state to go with of the island that had been purchased by the state in 1969. The last herds of cattle were removed from the island in 1984 after an extremely snowy winter that caused the death by starvation of about 350 heifers and calves. The meltwater from the heavy snows flooded the causeway, limiting access to the island. Ranchers resorted to hiring barges and making multiple trips from shore to island to salvage their stock. = Protected status = The process of changing Antelope Island from a privately owned ranch to a state park took many years. During the early 20th century there was talk of the island being acquired by the Federal Government for the establishment of a national park. Later the focus turned to making the island a state park. The first successful bid towards the creation of a state park took place in 1969 when on the northern end of the island were acquired by the State of Utah. The final purchase of the Fielding Garr Ranch in 1981 led to the entirety of Antelope Island being given protected status as Antelope Island State Park. A. H. Leonard purchased the herd of bison from the Dooly family in 1926. Leonard intended to see the herd to zoos. He found it impossible to get the bison off the island due to the water level and the drafts and sizes of the boats that were available to him. At this point he offered to sell the herd to the Federal Government if a national park were to be established on the island. Time Magazine cites \\"Congressional apathy\\" as being the reason the island and bison herd were not protected. Senator Frank E. Moss of Utah asked the National Park Service consider the Great Salt Lake for inclusion in the National Park System in 1959. The study had high praise for Antelope Island as a potential national park, but found \\"little else worthwhile about the Great Salt Lake\\". The National Park service was concerned with a lack of planning by the State of Utah and the fact that the lake was used as a dumping site for municipal and industrial waste. The park service was impressed by the scenic and recreational possibilities of the northern end of Antelope Island, describing it as the \\"most impressive site of the lake.\\" The qualities of the island were not enough to persuade the park service to seek the creation of a national park encompassing the Great Salt Lake. The park service cited years of \\"mismanagement, apathy, and lack of any coordinated plan for its proper development.\\" Sewage from Salt Lake City that was being dumped untreated into the lake at the time and waste from a smelting facility on the southern end of the lake were two of the greatest sources of pollution. The park service did express interest in safeguarding the lake since it is a remnant of the Pleistocene. The park service also noted a lack of recreation on the lake and an inaction by the state to positively respond to an earlier request for the formation of a state park. Antelope Island State Park was established in 1969 as Great Salt Lake State Park. At the time the facilities at the park were minimal. Temporary shower facilities were constructed and available for a \\"long weekend\\" over the Memorial Day weekend of 1969. Boating facilities were also available on a limited basis. In 1971 the directors of the Golden Spike Empire, Inc., a local civic group that sought to promote the Great Salt Lake area as a tourist destination, recommended that all of Antelope Island be purchased. The group encouraged the development of the state park on the northern end of the island. GSE encouraged the establishment of a national monument on the remainder of the island. Davis County commissioners were against the establishment of a national monument citing the \\"look but don't touch\\" rules of national monuments. The local government was in favor of the state park and encouraged its development as a means of attracting tourists and increasing county revenues. The Fielding Garr Ranch was purchased by the state in 1982 at a cost of $4.5 million. Access to the park was limited to a causeway on the southern end of the park at Saltair that was built in the 1950s. The park hosted a \\"moderate number\\" of visitors during the 1960s and 70s. Visitation came to a stop in 1983 when floodwaters washed out the southern causeway. Cars did not return to the park until 1993 when the northern causeway was opened.  Natural history  Great Salt Lake = Looking south towards White Rock Bay View of Buffalo Bay and the causeway to the mainland. Antelope Island State Park is surrounded by the Great Salt Lake. The lake is the last remaining part of a vast inland Pleistocene sea, Lake Bonneville. At more than 1,000 feet (305 m) deep and more than in area, the lake was nearly as large as Lake Michigan and significantly deeper. With the change in climate, the lake began drying up, leaving Great Salt Lake, Utah Lake, Sevier Lake, and Rush Lake as remnants. As Lake Bonneville receded it left behind the Great Basin, which is made of narrow mountain ranges and broad valleys, known locally as basins. The Great Salt Lake is endorheic and has very high salinity, far saltier than sea water. The Jordan, Weber, and Bear rivers deposit around 1.1 million tons of minerals in the lake each year. Due to its high salt concentration, most people can easily float in the lake as a result of the higher density of the water. The Great Salt Lake is the fourth-largest terminal lake in the world, In an average year the lake covers an area of approximately , but the lake's size fluctuates due to low water levels. For example, in 1963 it reached its lowest recorded level at 950 square miles (2,460 km2), but in 1987 the surface area was at the historic high of . Great Salt Lake does not support fish, but does support large numbers of brine shrimp and brine flieshttps://stateparks.utah.gov/parks/antelope- island/current-conditions/ which provide food for visiting waterfowl. Because of the high salinity, the island is mostly without readily available fresh water. = Geology = Antelope Island is and is long and at its widest point. The island is in the midst of the Great Basin between the Wasatch and Sierra Nevada mountain ranges. The highest point on the island is Frary Peak at above sea level. It is one of eight important islands in the lake. The others are Badger, Bird, Dolphin, Gunnison, Carrington, Stansbury and Fremont. Two of the major islands, Gunnison and Bird, and two minor islands, Egg and White Rock are rookeries and as such are protected. Visitor access is not permitted on the protected islands. The rocks in and around the Fielding Garr Ranch are some of the oldest rocks in the United States. At 2.7 billion years old, they are older than the rocks in the bottom of the Grand Canyon. Tintic Quartzite is found on the northern third of the island. It is about 550 million years old. Tufa rocks on the island are some of the youngest rocks in the United States. They were deposited as Lake Bonneville receded between 10,000 - 15,000 years ago. The tufa rocks resemble concrete and are in the vicinity of Buffalo Point.  Activities  thumb Antelope Island State Park is open for year- round recreation. It features a marina, beach, campground and hiking trails. Tourists pay a fee to access the park via the islands causeways. The northern are developed. There are several campsites, a day use area, swimming area, and picnic areas near Bridger Bay on the northwestern end of the island. There is a restaurant on Buffalo Point. The rest of the park is largely undeveloped. A few old roads cross the island and so do some hiking trails. The remnants of old mining claims and the Fielding Garr Ranch are open to park visitors. There are plans to construct a historic boat display at the marina. Antelope Island is known for its scenic beauty, especially in the northwest quadrant of the island at Buffalo Point and White Rock Bay, where mountains and hills overlook beaches as well as the reflecting waters of the Great Salt Lake and other islands that are visible in the lake. A balloon festival is held yearly, around Labor Day. Birdwatching on Antelope Island is popular.http://www.utahbirds.org/PrintCenter/ChListAntelopeIsland.pdf Hiking and CyclingAntelope Island Trail  Utah.com are popular activities, but water is scarce and there are few trees on the island. Though not strictly a desert island there are no permanent human inhabitants and conditions are quite dry and can be very hot during the summer. Freely flowing freshwater is not readily available on the island, though there are a few natural springs, mostly in the mountainous spine of the island and towards the south end of the island. Water and restrooms are available in the visitor areas of the island. There is a gift shop and a small fast-food restaurant that is open during the main visitor season at Buffalo Point. Electric bikes are available for rentals or tours. Public beaches, a marina, and overnight camping areas are available and popular on the northern part of the island.Antelope Island State Park  Utah State Parks Observing wildlife is also popular on Antelope Island, especially the large numbers of bison which are part of the Antelope Island bison herd. Coyotes and antelope are sometimes seen close to the main roads and campsites, and bison often wander across the roads, though the bison are most often found towards the south end of the island near the Fielding Garr Ranch. Other activities on the island include visiting the historic Fielding Garr Ranch, horseback riding and photography. Several trail running races are held on the island each year at distances of , , and .Buffalo Run File:Antelope Island Causeway 2005.JPGCauseway connecting Antelope Island to Syracuse, Utah.

Bison are herded from the southern end of the island to holding pens on the northern end of the island. There the bison are vaccinated for parasites, infectious bovine rhino tracheitis, clostridium and bovine vibriosis. DNA and blood samples are taken. The bison are tagged with microchips and weighed and measured. The female bison are also vaccinated for brucellosis and checked for pregnancy. With the goal of keeping the herd at a manageable level the excess bison, about 150 - 200 head, are auctioned off in an annual sale that nets about $120,000 for the park.  Wildlife  Antelope Island State Park provides a habitat for a wide variety of wildlife. Despite its name, the park is most famous for its herd of bison. The size of the Antelope Island bison herd ranges from 550 to 700 animals and is controlled by an annual bison round-up. The Antelope Island bison herd is one of the oldest and largest in the United States. The park is also home to jackrabbits, pronghorn, bobcats, mule deer, coyotes, and several species of rodents. The island and Great Salt Lake attract migrating birds. The inland grasslands on the island provide habitat for chukars, burrowing owls, long-billed curlews and several species of birds of prey. = Bison = John Dooly, owner of the island in 1893, with the help of William Glassman brought a herd of twelve bison to Antelope Island. At the time American bison were nearly extinct in North America, having suffered years of over hunting and extermination during the settlement of the American West. Biologists estimate that as many as 60 million bison roamed the western United States prior to the lands being settled by Anglo Americans. These bison once inhabited the grasslands of North America in massive herds; their range stretched across most of what is now the United States, from Florida and New York in the east and south to the Texas/Mexico border and the Yukon Territory in Canada to the south and north and all the way west to the Pacific Coast. The bison were an important resource for the native tribes of the western United States. The United States Government knew this and began a campaign to rid the plains of the bison, thereby depriving the Native Americans of their most prized natural resource and making them dependent on handouts from the government. Without the bison the Native Americans were forced to \\"seek peace\\". Some conservationists saw that destroying the bison population was detrimental to the future of the nation and in 1874 Congress voted to stop the government sponsored slaughter. By the 1890s approximately 800 bison remained. Dooly purchased the bison after Glassman had failed to establish a bison preserve on the south shore of the Great Salt Lake. Glassman had hope to attract tourists to the area with some of the few remaining bison in the United States at the time. His venture failed and he was forced to sell some of the herd at auction. Dooly bought the bison with the intention of supplementing his income with private bison hunts. At approximately the same time a herd of elk was brought to the island. The elk did not last very long due to the island being a poor habitat for elk. In 1993, 17 elk were reintroduced to the island with negative results; three drowned, three were never found, the remaining eleven survived. However, due to the lack of a natural predator, the gray wolf, the bison thrived on the island and the herd rapidly increased in size. One of the many bison found on Antelope Island The island was opened for bison hunts beginning in 1896. The hunting of bison on the island was limited to those who could afford the $200 requested by Dooly and his ancestors. Heavyweight boxing champion Jack Dempsey and 1920s sports writer Robert Edgren were just two of the celebrities that came to the island to shoot a bison. Bison hunting continued on the island until 1926 when the final \\"Big Buffalo Hunt\\" eliminated all but a few of the bison. Public sentiment changed during the 1920s and activists began to call for the protection of the herd on Antelope Island. A silent film produced by Paramount Pictures, The Covered Wagon (1923), was partly filmed on Antelope Island when buffalo hunt and buffalo stampede scenes were needed. At the time, the bison herd on Antelope Island was possibly the largest herd of bison in the United States. After much effort, about 350 of the animals were herded into a stampede, which was then filmed under the direction of James Cruze. The movie is considered by some people to be the first great Western Epic and it established some of the tropes that persist in Western movies, such as circling the wagons in time of danger or attacks. During filming of the movie, seven buffalo were shot and killed for the hunting scenes. \\"Don't grow sentimental over the seven,\\" said Cruze, the director of the film. \\"The folks out there would like to get rid of the whole herd and they would, but for the sentimental hubbub that is always raised when they talk of rounding out the buffalo. The animals are worthless — there isn't worse meat on Earth to eat — and they ruin the whole territory for cattle grazing purposes. So the buffalo remain — sentimental reminders of the America of the past.\\"http://www.cinemaweb.com/silentfilm/bookshelf/28_ph_01.htm The hunt of 1926 was covered by Time. A herd of approximately 300-400 bison was culled to about 50 by a large group of hunters on horseback with modern rifles. John Dooly had sold the herd to A. H. Leonard in 1924. Leonard intended to sell the bison to zoos, but was not able to corral them. He next tried to offer the island and the Antelope Island bison herd to the United States Department of the Interior. Leonard had hoped that a national park would be established on the island therefore preserving the herd. Time Magazine cites \\"Congressional apathy\\" for the lack of a land transfer. Leonard was once again forced to change his business plan. This time he wanted to expand the cattle ranching on the island and to do this the number of bison needed to be reduced. Leonard announced that a hunt would be held in the fall of 1926. The hunt took place in November, but not without protests from around the nation. The New York World and other newspapers of the day tried to arouse public sentiment against the hunt. Utah governor George Dern received formal protests of the hunt from the American Humane Society, Massachusetts, governor Alvan T. Fuller and Boston mayor Malcolm Nichols. Governor Dern declined to prevent the hunt stating, \\"Antelope Island and the buffalo herd are privately owned.\\" The hunt took place with noted participants Ralph and Edward Ammerman of Scranton, Pennsylvania, and big game hunter J. O. Beebe of Omaha, Nebraska. The Antelope Island bison herd and the island remained in private hands until 1969 when the northern of the island were purchased by the state of Utah. The southern end of the island was acquired in 1981, granting the entire herd protected status on Antelope Island State Park. In 1986, park rangers saw the need to begin controlling the bison population to prevent overgrazing and disease. The first roundup was held in 1987 and it has since become an annual event that brings in revenue by way of the sale of excess bison and tourist dollars brought in by spectators. Every year, in late October, all the bison on the island are herded to a central area in a \\"Great Buffalo Roundup\\" and sent briefly into pens where they are examined, weighed and vaccinated, whereupon decisions are made on culling and selecting breeding stock. The majority of the bison are then released within a few days, and are again allowed to roam free on the island. The Antelope Island bison herd fluctuates in size between 550 and 700 head, and is one of the largest publicly owned bison herds in the nation. The reason for the variability of the size of the herd is that the bison produce approximately 150 to 200 calves annually, and since this is prime prairie habitat for bison, with no significant predators, the herd can increase by up to half every year. It has been determined that 700 head is near the maximum preferred carrying capacity for bison on the island, so the excess bison need to be culled. Bison from this island are often sent to other herd locations around North America due to their genetic isolation, some unique genetic markers contained in the population, and because of their disease-free condition. Some bison are also purchased at the pen site in a yearly public auction, and are taken as meat or breeding stock for commercial farms in other parts of the world. In 2020, the podcast This is Love released an episode featuring Antelope Island and two bison attacks that took place there. = Bighorn sheep = Bighorn sheep were introduced to Antelope Island State Park in the late 1990s. The herd on the island was gathered from herds in Nevada and British Columbia. Biologists at the park and with the state of Utah felt that Antelope Island would be an \\"ideal oasis\\" for establishing a \\"nursery herd\\" of bighorn. The sheep are protected from human threats on the island and can be used to reintroduce the bighorn in areas throughout western North America. The target population for the herd on the island is about 125–150 head. When the numbers are greater than 150 the excess sheep are gathered and sent to new homes. The nursery herd has largely been a success. The herd is thriving and it is providing the needed animals to re-establish or strengthen herds of bighorn sheep elsewhere. There are some problems. One is the lack of natural predators on the island. There are no cougars on the island and the sheep that grow up on Antelope Island grow up without an \\"innate fear\\" of their primary predators on the lands away from the island. Another problem with moving the sheep is the financial cost of moving them off the island. It can cost up to $1,000 per animal. The sheep are moved by helicopter from the island and then by truck to their final destination. Also the sheep undergo a tremendous amount of stress with the move and biologists liken moving an animal from one place to another with transplanting organs in humans. The bighorn are placed on public and private lands with the help of The Foundation for North American Wild Sheep. The foundation buys grazing permits from domestic sheep ranchers. In exchange for the grazing rights the ranchers agree to remove their domestic herds. In 2018 a mysterious respiratory ailment felled most of the island's sheep. The remaining sheep were shot in 2019 in order to prepare the island for repopulation. Other mammals found on the island include mule deer (estimated to number 250), pronghorn antelope (approximately 200 on the island), bighorn sheep (estimated 200), coyotes, bobcats, badgers, porcupines, cottontail rabbits, jackrabbits, and several species of ground squirrels and other rodents. = Birds = The wetlands surrounding the Great Salt Lake account for nearly 80% of the wetlands in Utah. The lake and surrounding wetlands are home to over 250 species of birds and form a stop over on the Pacific Flyway between South and North America. Between four and six million birds nest and feed on the lake every year. The world's largest populations of white-faced ibis and California gulls make their homes near the lake. A large population of black-necked stilts, American avocets and newborn pelicans are also found on and near the Great Salt Lake. Many of the birds come to Antelope Island State Park to feed on the abundant quantities of brine flies and brine shrimp. The two most popular places for bird watching on the island are at the causeway and near the Fielding Garr Ranch. Along the shoreline of the island, mallard, Canada goose, avocets, black-necked stilts, willets, long-billed curlews, sanderlings, American white pelicans, pied-billed grebes, killdeer, great blue herons, snowy egrets, white-faced ibis and many migratory birds can be observed. The island grasslands provide habitat for ring-necked pheasants, California quail, burrowing owls, chukar partridges, rock doves, mourning doves, horned larks, red-winged blackbirds and many other species, plus several species of raptors.

Used books typically become available on the market when they are sold or given to a second-hand shop, used book sale or used bookstore; they are usually sold for about half or three-quarters the price of what they would cost new, though rare books and others still in demand or hard to obtain might sell for more than this. Some new book shops also carry used books, and some used book shops also sell new books. Though the original authors or publishers will not benefit financially from the sale of a used book, it helps to keep old books in circulation. Sometimes very old, rare, first edition, antique, or simply out of print books can be found as used books in used book shops. A reading copy of a book may be well-used, may include highlighting or marginalia, and is suitable for reading, but is not collectible. This is a term used in the used book business, to indicate the lack of collectible value, while claiming that the book is in sufficiently good condition for a purchaser whose interest is primarily in actually reading the book. A reading copy is typically less expensive than a collectible copy. Booktowns A number of small towns have become centres for used book sellers, most notably Hay-on-Wye in South Wales. They act as a magnet for buyers, and are located in country areas of great scenic beauty.

Mobile radio networks have traffic issues that do not arise in connection with the fixed line PSTN. Important aspects of cellular traffic include: quality of service targets, traffic capacity and cell size, spectral efficiency and sectorization, traffic capacity versus coverage, and channel holding time analysis. Teletraffic engineering in telecommunications network planning ensures that network costs are minimised without compromising the quality of service (QoS) delivered to the user of the network. This field of engineering is based on probability theory and can be used to analyse mobile radio networks, as well as other telecommunications networks. A mobile handset which is moving in a cell will record a signal strength that varies. Signal strength is subject to slow fading, fast fading and interference from other signals, resulting in degradation of the carrier-to-interference ratio (C/I).Walke, Bernhard H. Mobile Radio Networks: Networking, protocols and traffic performance. West Sussex England: John Wiley, 2002. Chapter 2. A high C/I ratio yields quality communication. A good C/I ratio is achieved in cellular systems by using optimum power levels through the power control of most links. When carrier power is too high, excessive interference is created, degrading the C/I ratio for other traffic and reducing the traffic capacity of the radio subsystem. When carrier power is too low, C/I is too low and QoS targets are not met. Quality of Service targets At the time that the cells of a radio subsystem are designed, Quality of Service (QoS) targets are set, for: traffic congestion and blocking, dominant coverage area, C/I, outage probability, handover failure rate, overall call success rate, data rate, delay, etc. Traffic load and cell size The more traffic generated, the more base stations will be needed to service the customers. The number of base stations for a simple cellular network is equal to the number of cells. The traffic engineer can achieve the goal of satisfying the increasing population of customers by increasing the number of cells in the area concerned, so this will also increases the number of base stations. This method is called cell splitting (and combined with sectorization) is the only way of providing services to a burgeoning population. This simply works by dividing the cells already present into smaller sizes hence increasing the traffic capacity. Reduction of the cell radius enables the cell to accommodate extra traffic. The cost of equipment can also be cut down by reducing the number of base stations through setting up three neighbouring cells, with the cells serving three 120° sectors with different channel groups. Mobile radio networks are operated with finite, limited resources (the spectrum of frequencies available). These resources have to be used effectively to ensure that all users receive service, that is, the quality of service is consistently maintained. This need to carefully use the limited spectrum, brought about the development of cells in mobile networks, enabling frequency re-use by successive clusters of cells. Systems that efficiently use the available spectrum have been developed e.g. the GSM system. Bernhard Walke defines spectral efficiency as the traffic capacity unit divided by the product of bandwidth and surface area element, and is dependent on the number of radio channels per cell and the cluster size (number of cells in a group of cells): :\\\\mathrm{efficiency}=\\\\frac{N_\\\\mathrm{c}}{\\\\mathrm{BW}\\\\cdot A_\\\\mathrm{c}}, where Nc is the number of channels per cell, BW is the system bandwidth, and Ac is Area of cell. Sectorization is briefly described in traffic load and cell size as a way to cut down equipment costs in a cellular network. When applied to clusters of cells sectorization also reduces co-channel interference, according to Walke. This is because the power radiated backward from a directional base station antenna is minimal and interfering with adjacent cells is reduced. (The number of channels is directly proportional to the number of cells.) The maximum traffic capacity of sectored antennas (directional) is greater than that of omnidirectional antennas by a factor which is the number of sectors per cell (or cell cluster). Traffic capacity versus coverage Cellular systems use one or more of four different techniques of access (TDMA, FDMA, CDMA, SDMA). See Cellular concepts. Let a case of Code Division Multiple Access be considered for the relationship between traffic capacity and coverage (area covered by cells). CDMA cellular systems can allow an increase in traffic capacity at the expense of the quality of service.Key, P., and Smith, D. Teletraffic Engineering in a competitive world. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam Netherlands, 1999. Chapter 1 (Plenary) and 3 (Mobile). In TDMA/FDMA cellular radio systems, Fixed Channel Allocation (FCA) is used to allocate channels to customers. In FCA the number of channels in the cell remains constant irrespective of the number of customers in that cell. This results in traffic congestion and some calls being lost when traffic gets heavy.Teletraffic Issues Related to Channel Allocation in Digital Mobile Cellular Networks. Last accessed 15 March 2005. A better way of channel allocation in cellular systems is Dynamic Channel Allocation (DCA) which is supported by the GSM, DCS and other systems. DCA is a better way not only for handling bursty cell traffic but also in efficiently using the cellular radio resources. DCA allows the number of channels in a cell to vary with the traffic load, hence increasing channel capacity with little costs. Since a cell is allocated a group of frequency carries (e.g. f1-f7) for each user, this range of frequencies is the bandwidth of that cell, BW. If that cell covers an area Ac, and each user has bandwidth B then the number of channels will be BW/B. The density of channels will be \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{BW}}{A_\\\\mathrm{c}\\\\cdot\\\\mathrm{B}}.Chitamu, P. J., Telecommunications Access Networks. University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, 2005. This formula shows that as the coverage area Ac is increased, the channel density decreases. Channel holding time Important parameters like the carrier-to-interference ratio (C/I), spectral efficiency and reuse distance determine the quality of service of a cellular network. Channel Holding Time is another parameter that can affect the quality of service in a cellular network, hence it is considered when planning the network. Calculating the channel holding time, however is not easy. (This is the time a Mobile Station (MS) remains in the same cell during a call). Channel holding time is therefore less than call holding time if the MS travels more than one cell as handover will take place and the MS relinquishes the channel. Practically, it is not possible to determine exactly the channel holding time. As a result, different models exist for the channel holding time distribution. In industry, a good approximation of the channel holding time is usually sufficient to determine the network traffic capability. One of the papers in Key and Smith defines channel holding time as being equal to the average holding time divided by the average number of handovers per call plus one. Usually an exponential model is preferred to calculate the channel holding time for simplicity in simulations. This model gives the distribution function of channel holding time and it is an approximation that can be used to obtain estimates channel holding time. The exponential model may not be correctly modelling the channel holding time distribution as other papers may try to prove, but it gives an approximation. Channel holding time is not easily determined explicitly, call holding time and user's movements have to be determined in order to implicitly give channel holding time. The mobility of the user and the cell shape and size cause the channel holding time to have a different distribution function to that of call duration (call holding time). This difference is large for highly mobile users and small cell sizes. Since the channel holding time and call duration relationships are affected by mobility and cell size, for a stationary MS and large cell sizes, channel holding time and call duration are the same.

In economics, the term technology shock usually refers to events in a macroeconomic model, that change the production function. Usually this is modeled with an aggregate production function that has a scaling factor. Normally reference is made to positive (i.e., productivity enhancing) technological changes, though technology shocks can also be contractionary.Basu, S., Fernald, J.G., Kimball, M.S. (2006) \\"Are technology improvements contractionary?\\" American Economic Review 96:1418-1448. The term “shock” connotes the fact that technological progress is not always gradual – there can be large-scale discontinuous changes that significantly alter production methods and outputs in an industry, or in the economy as a whole. Such a technology shock can occur in many different ways.Schilling, M. A. (2015). \\"Technology Shocks, Technological Collaboration, and Innovation Outcomes\\". Organization Science 26 (3): 668–686. doi:10.1287/orsc.2015.0970. For example, it may be the result of advances in science that enable new trajectories of innovation, or may result when an existing technological alternative improves to a point that it overtakes the dominant design, or is transplanted to a new domain. It can also occur as the result of a shock in another system, such as when a change in input prices dramatically changes the price/performance relationship for a technologyEhrnberg, E.

Positive technology shock The Industrial Revolution is an example of a positive technology shock. The Industrial Revolution occurred between the 18th and the 19th centuries where major changes in agriculture, manufacturing, mining, transport, and technology occurred. What this did to the economy at the time was notable. It increased wages steadily over the period of time and it also increased population because people had the wages for standard living. This is an example of a positive technology shock, where it increases national and disposable income, and also increases the labor force. The Industrial Revolution also provided a much more efficient way to produce goods which lead to less labor-intensive work. The rise of the internet, which coincided with rapid innovation in related networking equipment and software, also caused a major shock to the economy. The internet was a “general purpose technology” with the potential to transform information dissemination on a massive scale. The shock created both great opportunity and great uncertainty for firms, precipitating large increases in alliance activity and an increase in innovation across a wide range of sectors. Negative technology shock The oil shocks that occurred in the late 1970s are examples of negative technology shocks. When the oil shocks occurred, the energy that was used to extract to oil became more expensive, the energy was the technology in this case. The price of the capital and the labor both went up due to this shock, and this is an example of a negative technology shock. More examples There are many examples of different types of technology shocks, but one of the biggest in the past couple of decades has been Web 2.0. Web 2.0 was a huge technological advancement in the e commerce business, it allowed for user interaction benefiting businesses in different ways. It allowed for user feedback, ratings, comments, user content, etc. Web 2.0 revolutionized the online business as a whole, an example of a positive technology shock. Real business cycle theory Real business cycle theory (RBCT) is the theory where any type of shock has a ripple effect into many other shocks. To relate this to current times the upward price on oil is a RBCT because of the negative technology shock that happened due to the raise in price for the process of extracting of the oil. Now due to this increase in price for energy to extract the oil, fewer people could afford oil which drove economic activity down and at the same time lessens a countries national GDP. Typically, a RBCT starts with a negative type of shock, which is why the RBCT is becoming less and less relevant in today's economics. More and more economists are arguing against the RBCT because very rarely can you have a negative shock on technology with the amount of advancements we are going through now.

The title page often shows the title of the work, the person or body responsible for its intellectual content, and the imprint, which contains the name and address of the book's publisher and its date of publication. Particularly in paperback editions it may contain a shorter title than the cover or lack a descriptive subtitle. Further information about the publication of the book, including its copyright information, is frequently printed on the verso of the title page. Also often included there are the ISBN and a \\"printer's key\\", also known as the \\"number line\\", which indicates the print run to which the volume belongs. The first printed books, or incunabula, did not have title pages: the text simply begins on the first page, and the book is often identified by the initial words—the incipit—of the text proper. In academic publishing The title page of a thesis or essay is the work's first page. It lists the title of the work and the name of the author. In the case of an academic paper, the title page also lists class information (such as the course name and number), identification information (such as the student number), the date, name of the professor, and name of the institution. The title page is not numbered. Title pages are not required in all citation styles; instead, some styles require that the same information is placed at the top of the essay's first page. The title page for a thesis contains the full title, the author's name and academic credentials, the degree-granting faculty and department name, the name of the university and date of graduation, and the universal copyright symbol. The thesis title page is usually page i, but is not numbered; the abstract (page ii) is the first numbered page.

If a reseller refuses to maintain prices, either openly or covertly (see grey market), the manufacturer may stop doing business with it.This was what actually happened in the important U.S. Supreme Court case, Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc. (2007). Resale price maintenance prevents resellers from competing too fiercely on price, especially with regard to fungible goods. Otherwise, resellers worry it could drive down profits for themselves as well as for the manufacturer. Some argue that the manufacturer may do this because it wishes to keep resellers profitable, thus keeping the manufacturer profitable. Others contend that minimum resale price maintenance, for instance, overcomes a failure in the market for distributional services by ensuring that distributors who invest in promoting the manufacturer's product are able to recoup the additional costs of such promotion in the price that they charge consumers. Some manufacturers also defend resale price maintenance by saying it ensures fair returns, both for manufacturer and reseller and that governments do not have the right to interfere with freedom to make contracts without a very good reason. United Kingdom law In Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v Selfridge & Co Ltd [1915] AC 847, an English contract law case, tyre manufacturer Dunlop had signed an agreement with a dealer to get paid £5 per tyre in liquidated damages if the product was sold below the list price (other than to motor traders). The House of Lords held that Dunlop could not enforce the agreement. However, this had nothing to do with the legality of resale price maintenance clauses, which was not in any question at the time. The decision was based on the doctrine of privity of contract, as retailer Selfridge had bought Dunlop's goods from an intermediary and had no contractual relationship with Dunlop. In the case of Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v New Garage & Motor Co Ltd [1915] AC 79, the House of Lords upheld the enforceability of the requirement in the resale price maintenance clause, to pay £5 damages per item sold below list price, on the basis that it was not a penalty clause (which would be unenforceable) but a valid and enforceable liquidated damages clause. In 1955, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's report Collective Discrimination: A Report on Exclusive Dealing, Aggregated Rebates and Other Discriminatory Trade Practices recommended that resale price maintenance, when collectively enforced by manufacturers, should be made illegal, but individual manufacturers should be allowed to continue the practice. The report was the basis for the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1956, specifically prohibiting collective enforcement of resale price maintenance in the UK. Restrictive agreements had to be registered at the Restrictive Practices Court and were considered on individual merit. In 1964, the Resale Prices Act was passed, which now considered all resale price agreements to be against public interest unless proven otherwise. In 2010, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) opened a formal investigation into allegations by an Online Travel Agent (OTA), Skoosh, of resale price maintenance in the hotel industry. The investigation focussed on agreements between OTAs and hotels which may have resulted in fixed or minimum resale prices. In September 2015, the OFT's successor, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), closed its investigation into suspected breaches of competition law in the hotel online booking sector. In relation to competition, Article 101 and Article 102 of the Treaty on Functioning of the EU (TFEU) are paramount over all member states' national laws relating to competition. The Court of Justice of the European Union and the European Commission have both held that resale price maintenance is generally prohibited. UK law must apply this interpretation when dealing with inter member-state agreements between undertakings. United States law In Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park and Sons, , the United States Supreme Court affirmed a lower court's holding that a massive minimum resale price maintenance scheme was unreasonable and thus offended Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The decision rested on the assertion that minimum resale price maintenance is indistinguishable in economic effect from naked horizontal price fixing by a cartel. Subsequent decisions characterized Dr Miles as holding that minimum resale price maintenance is unlawful per se (automatically). On June 28, 2007, the Supreme Court overruled Dr. Miles, discussed above, holding that such vertical price restraints as Minimum Advertised Pricing are not per se unlawful but, rather, must be judged under the \\"rule of reason\\". Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., . This marked a dramatic shift on how attorneys and enforcement agencies address the legality of contractual minimum prices and essentially allowed the reestablishment of resale price maintenance in the United States in most (but not all) commercial situations. During the Great Depression in the 1930s, a large number of U.S. states began passing fair trade laws that authorized resale price maintenance. These laws were intended to protect independent retailers from the price-cutting competition of large chain stores. Since these laws allowed vertical price fixing, they directly conflicted with the Sherman Antitrust Act, and Congress had to carve out a special exception for them with the Miller–Tydings Act of 1937. This special exception was expanded in 1952 by the McGuire Act (which overrode a 1951 Supreme Court decision that gave a narrower reading of the Miller–Tydings Act). The fair trade laws became widely unpopular after World War II and so the Miller–Tydings Act and the McGuire Act were repealed by the Consumer Goods Pricing Act of 1975. In 1968, the Supreme Court extended the per se rule against minimum resale price maintenance to maximum resale price maintenance, in Albrecht v. Herald Co., . The Court opined that such contracts always limited the freedom of dealers to price as they wished. The Court also opined that the practice \\"may\\" channel distribution through a few large, efficient dealers, prevent dealers from offering essential services, and that the \\"maximum\\" price could instead become a minimum price. In 1997, the Supreme Court overruled Albrecht, in State Oil v. Khan, . Several decades after Dr Miles, scholars began to question the assertion that minimum resale price maintenance, a vertical restraint, was the economic equivalent of a naked horizontal cartel. In 1960, Lester G. Telser, an economist at the University of Chicago, argued that manufacturers could employ minimum resale price maintenance as a tool to ensure that dealers engaged in the desired promotion of a manufacturer's product through local advertising, product demonstrations, and the like. Without such contractual restraints, Telser said, no frills distributors might \\"free ride\\" on the promotional efforts of full service distributors, thereby undermining the incentives of full service dealers to expend resources on promotion. Six years later, Robert Bork reiterated and expanded upon Telser's argument, contending that resale price maintenance was simply one form of contractual integration, analogous to complete vertical integration, that could overcome a failure in the market for distributional services. Bork also argued that non-price vertical restraints, such as exclusive territories, could achieve the same results. In 1978, the U.S. Supreme Court held that non-price vertical restraints, such as vertically imposed exclusive territories, were to be analyzed under a fact-based \\"rule of reason\\". In so doing, the Court embraced the logic of Bork and Telser as applied to such restraints, opining that, in a \\"purely competitive situation\\", dealers might free ride on each other's promotional efforts. In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the repeal of Miller–Tydings implied that the Sherman Act's complete ban of vertical price fixing was again effective, and that even the 21st Amendment could not shield California's liquor resale price maintenance regime from the reach of the Sherman Act. California Liquor Dealers v. Midcal Aluminum, . Thus, from the 1975 enactment of the Consumer Goods Pricing Act to the 2007 Leegin decision, resale price maintenance was again no longer legal in the United States.

An astutely political man, Campbell was one of the men implicated in the Massacre of Glencoe. Biography He took part in the abortive royalist uprising under Glencairn in 1654, and was one of those who urged Monck to declare a free parliament in England to facilitate the restoration. He sat in the Scottish parliament as member for Argyllshire from 1669 to 1674. In October 1672, as principal creditor to George Sinclair, 6th Earl of Caithness, he obtained the inheritance of his lands and properties. After the 6th Earl's death without heirs; he became Earl of Caithness and Viscount of Breadalbane. In 1678 he married the former Earl's widow, Mary Campbell, the Countess of Caithness, an economical step which saved him his obligation to pay her 12,000 marks a year. In 1680 he invaded Caithness with a band of 800 men and defeated and dispossessed the contingent of the Sinclairs at the Battle of Altimarlach. The natural heir, a younger son of the fifth earl however, was subsequently confirmed in his lands and titles by the Parliament of Scotland, so on 13 August 1681, Campbell obtained a new patent which made him Earl of Breadalbane and Holland, Viscount of Tay and Paintland, and Lord Glenorchy, Benederloch, Ormelie and Wick, in the Peerage of Scotland, with special power to nominate his successor from among the sons of his first wife. In 1685 he became a member of the Scottish privy council. Though nominally a Presbyterian he had assisted the intolerant and despotic government of the Duke of Lauderdale in 1678 with 1700 men. He was reputed to own the best wig in Scotland and his influence, owing to his position and abilities, was greater than that of any man in Scotland other than his cousin, the Duke of Argyll, a relationship that irked him and led to his continuous political manoeuvering to improve his lot. It was important that William III obtained his services in conciliating the Highlanders. Breadalbane at first carried on communications with Dundee and was implicated in the Jacobite intrigue called the Montgomery plot, but after the battle of Killiecrankie in July 1689 he made overtures to the government, subsequently took the oath of allegiance, and was entrusted with a large sum of money by the government to secure the submission of the clans. On 30 June 1691 he met the Jacobite chiefs; he persuaded them to refrain from acts of hostility till October, gaining their consent by threats and promises rather than by the distribution of the money, which, it was believed, he retained himself. When asked to give an account of the expenditure to parliament, he replied :\\"The money is spent, the Highlands are quiet, and this is the only way of accounting between friends.\\"Various versions of this quote are mentioned in several publications through history; a few are: * Elizabeth Isabella Spence. Letters from the North Highlands, During the Summer 1816. (page 219) googlebooks *Sir Walter Scott. Tales of a grandfather. (page 214) googlebooks *Catherine Sinclair.

(page 122) googlebooks Breadalbane had a reputation for double- dealing which led to a lasting belief that he had a direct hand in the Massacre of the Macdonalds of Glen Coe in February 1692. In reality he was one of the few men to recognize the political damage the episode caused in the Highlands. However, the discovery of his negotiations with the Jacobite chiefs caused his imprisonment in Edinburgh Castle in September, but he was released when it was known that he had been acting with William's knowledge. Breadalbane did not vote for the Union in 1707, but was chosen a representative peer in the parliament of Great Britain of 1713–1715. His cooperation with the English government in securing the temporary submission of the Highlands was inspired by no real loyalty or allegiance, and he encouraged the attempted French dissent of 1708, refusing, however, to commit himself to paper. On the occasion of the Jacobite rising in 1715 he excused himself on 19 September from obeying the summons to appear at Edinburgh on the ground of his age and infirmity, but nevertheless the next day visited Jacobite camps at Logierait and Perth, his real business being, according to the Master of Sinclair: :\\"to trick others, not to be trickt, and to obtain a share of the French subsidies\\".John St Clair, Master of Sinclair was a veteran of several Scottish battles and relates his observations in his \\"Memoirs\\"; see paragraph 260 for the noted quote at archive.org He had taken money to provide 1200 men to the uprising, and only sent 300. His 300 men were withdrawn after the Battle of Sheriffmuir, and his death, on 19 March 1717, removed the need for an inquiry into his conduct. Marriage and family He married Lady Mary Rich, daughter of Henry Rich, 1st Earl of Holland and his wife Isabel Cope on 17 Dec 1657, with whom he had two sons, Duncan, styled Lord Ormelie (d. 1727), who was passed over in the succession 1685 due to his \\"mental incapacity\\", and John Campbell, 2nd Earl of Breadalbane and Holland (1662-1752). He married secondly 1678 Mary Campbell, widow of George Sinclair, the 6th Earl of Caithness, and daughter of Lady Margaret Douglas and Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll. By his second wife, he had a third son, Colin (d. 1708), who was the presumed ancestor (via an illegitimate son) of Sir Lachlan Campbell, one of the present contestants for the title of Earl of Breadalbane and Holland. He also had an illegitimate daughter, Mary Campbell (d. 1725), wife of Sir Archibald Cockburn, advocate, and mother of Sir Alexander Cockburn of Langton, 7th Bt. Lord Breadalbane died on 19 Mar 1717.

Bedsits are included in a legal category of dwellings referred to as houses in multiple occupation (HMO). Bedsits arose from the subdivision of larger dwellings into low-cost accommodation at low conversion cost. In the UK a growing desire for personal independence after World War II led to a reduced demand for traditional boarding houses with communal dining. Bedsits are often occupied by young single people, students, those unable to purchase their own properties, or those whose occupation is of a transitory nature; the cost is typically lower than for other types of property. Someone whose employment is a long distance from their home may sometimes rent a bedsit to reduce the cost and inconvenience of daily travel. In 2013, regulations came into force in Ireland, under which landlords were obliged to provide each tenant with a separate bathroom, a four-ring cooker, access to laundry facilities and other basic facilities, or risk being fined up to €5,000. Bedsits have since been outlawed in the Republic.\\"New landlord regulations will spell the end for grotty bedsits\\", Irish Independent, 2 February 2013 Other countries The Canadian and American equivalents to a bedsit are rooming houses and single room occupancy (SRO); however, in Canada those differ from bedsits in that rooming houses and SRO hotels generally do not provide tenants with private kitchen or bathing facilities- instead, those facilities are shared. True bedsits are rare in Canada but are found in some Maritime regions, such as the city of St. John's. The Australian equivalent to bedsit is called flatette. In New Zealand, the terms bedsit and granny flat are used interchangeably. A bedsit can also be compared to a Soviet communal apartment, in which a common kitchen, bathroom, toilet, and telephone are shared by several families, each of which lives in a single room opening up onto a common hallway. In Nigeria, a similar equivalent of a bedsit is the face-to-face apartment buildings, where a group of one or two room apartments have their entrances facing each other along a walkway, which leads to the main entrance of the building in which the apartments are located. The apartments, which often have shared bathrooms and kitchen spaces, are low rent and are commonly used by the low- income residents because of their affordability. Bedsits were once common in Dublin and other towns in Ireland, although they had been impractical to implement after the introduction of planning permission in 1963. Bedsits were banned in 2008 by the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008,S.I. No. 534/2008 - Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008 View SI Amendments with a phase-out date of February 2013. The Health Service Executive and approved housing bodies can still offer equivalent accommodation, which is mostly used as emergency accommodation for the homeless.

Justin Hayward, the song's composer and singer, wrote this in his own bed-sit at the age of 19. The song \\"Solitary Confinement\\" from The Members album At the Chelsea Nightclub, paints a grim picture of life in a bedsit room, portraying the life of a loner who has moved to the city, and spends all their time at work or at home watching television, and \\"eat(s) out of tins\\".

Its capital city is Sanniquellie and its most populous city is Ganta. With the county's area measuring , Nimba is the largest of Liberia's 15 counties. The county has six statutory districts. As of the 2008 Census, it had a population of 462,026, making it the second most-populous county in Liberia. Named after Mount Nimba (Neinbaa Tohn in the Mahn (or Mano) language), which demarcates part of the Guinea-Côte d'Ivoire border, Nimba is also bordered by Bong and Grand Bassa counties to the west, Rivercess County to the southwest, and Grand Gedeh County to the southeast. The northern and northeastern parts of Nimba border the nation of Republic of Guinea, while the northeast lies along the border of Côte d'Ivoire.  Government  Nimba County is one of fifteen counties of Liberia. During the nearly three-decade administration of William V.S. Tubman (1944–1971), the region now called Nimba County was one of three of Liberia's provinces: Western Province, Eastern Province, and Central Province. In the sixties, Tubman reorganized these provinces into counties. Central Province became what is known as Nimba County. Before the First Liberian Civil War broke out in 1989, the county had a population of over 310,000 people. The top executive in the counties is a County Superintendent, appointed by the president of the county. The current County Superintendent, D. Dorr Cooper, who is the chief administrative officer, was appointed by President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf in 2017. He was re- appointed in 2018 by President George Weah after a change in administrations.  National legislatures  The County is represented by two senators and by nine representatives in the bicameral Legislative Branch of Government. The two senators currently serving the citizens of Nimba County are senior Senator Prince Yormie Johnson and junior Senator Thomas Semandahn Grupee. = Administrative Districts = According to the 2008 census, the 17 Administrative Districts in Nimba County have the following populations: *Boe & Quilla District (18,262) *Buu-Yao District (40,007) *Doe District (35,918) *Garr Bain District (61,225) *Gbehlay-Geh District (32,176) *Gbi & Doru District (8,131) *Gbor District (10,875) *Kparblee District (11,424) *Leewehpea-Mahn District (24,747) *Meinpea-Mahn District (24,157) *Sanniquellie-Mah District (25,370) *Twah River District (37,479) *Garr Bain District (37,479) *Wee-Gbehy-Mahn District (32,934) *Yarmein District (22,718) *Yarpea Mahn District (21,647) *Yarwein Mehnsonnoh District (25,584) *Zoe-Gbao District (29,372) = Electoral Districts = Since the 2008 census, there 9 electoral districts in Nimba County: *Nimba District 1 Garr Bain District *Nimba District 2 Garr Bain District, Sanniquellie-Mahn District and Yarpea Mahn District *Nimba District 3 Garr Bain District, Gbehley-Geh District and Yarmein District *Nimba District 4 Gbor District and Twah River District *Nimba District 5 Buu-Yao District *Nimba District 6 Boe & Quilla District, Gblor District, Doe District and Kparblee District *Nimba District 7 Zoe-Gbao District and Wee-Gbehy-Mahn District *Nimba District 8 Leewehpea-Mahn District and Meinpea-Mahn District *Nimba District 9 Gbi & Doru District, Doe District and Yarwein-Mehnsonoh District  Iron ore  During the late 1950s, iron ore was found in \\"the Iron Mountain\\" Mount Nimba. In a joint venture among the Liberian Government, US Bethlehem Steel, and the Swedish mining company Gränges, a huge project was set up: LAMCO (Liberian American Company). The project contributed to economic and social development in Liberia for 30 years. It built the necessary infrastructure and operated mining, transporting ore by rail to the port of Buchanan, from where it was exported to other markets. Corruption was minimal and political stability improved. During this period, Liberia was classified among the most progressive countries in Africa. In 1980 civil war erupted between tribal factions. Nimba county was devastated by the civil war that followed. The iron ore had been degrading in quality, and world prices had plunged in this period. The combination led to a dismantling of the LAMCO project. Since the end of the Civil War (which lasted for more than a decade), there are discussions about renewing mining at Nimba is finally getting better. Arcelor-Mittal, a European-Indian steel business, is committed to reopening the iron mine at Nimba Mountain, outside the former company town of Yekepa. Hospitals and schools built and financed by LAMCO are now being run by ArcelorMittal. The houses which were built by LAMCO have partly been rehabilitated by ArcelorMittal, though many had been overtaken by rainforest development. BHP Billiton has engaged in an extraction agreement with the Government of Liberia to mine ore in Nimba. As such, they are active promoters of education, scholarship and, for the most part, human resources.  Demographics  The main ethnic groups in Nimba County are the Dan, also known as Gio and the Mano. The Dan, commonly known as the Gio, live closer to the Cote d'Ivoire border. In that French-speaking country, they are known as the Yacouba. The Mano live closer to the Guinea border. There are also indigenous minority groups, such as Krahn, Gbi, and Doru. Small Kpelle and Bassa settlements are located near the borders of Bong County and Grand Bassa County, respectively. These are the historical indigenous peoples of Nimba County who have settled in towns and villages. Various ethnic groups from other parts of Liberia, such as the Mandingo people, have also settled here. They are indigenous people of Lofa County, Guinea, and the Cote d'Ivoire. Other tribal peoples include the Lorma from Lofa. Since the early 20th century, peoples from all parts of West Africa have settled in Nimba. The ethnic Dan (Gio) own and live in these areas: Gbehlay-Geh Statutory District, Zoe-Geh Statutory District, and Tappita Statutory District. The main towns are Karnplay City, Bahn City, Tappitta City, Baylehglay, Buutuo, Garplay, Toweh town, Graie, Gbloulay, et cetera. The Man (or Mano) ethnic groups own and live in Sanniquellie Mah Statutory District, Saclepea Mah Statutory District, and the Yahwin-Mehnsonnoh Statutory District. The main towns are Sanniquellie City, Ganta City, Saclepea City, Flumpa, Zekepa, Kanwin, Yekepa and others. The ethnic Krahn live along the Ivory Coast border in Kpeahbleee District. The main towns are Zoudru, Behwoaloa, Yourpea Old Town, Yourpea New Town, et cetera. The other ethnic indigenous groups, the Gbi and Doru, live along the border of Grand Bassa and Rivercess counties. Their main towns are Glann Town, Camp One, Kidka's Town, and Torkpor's Town. The Gio and the Mano ethnic group together are referred to as the Dan, and are closely related tribes. They both claim to be descendants of one of the twelve tribes of Israel. They are believed to have links with the Danites. Most people refer to them as the Jews of Liberia, just as they will refer to Igbo as the Jews of Nigeria. There is, however, little or no practice of Judaism in Liberia, and no known synagogue. Most purported Liberian Jews are practicing Christians. There has not been DNA testing to assess the beliefs of the tribes. The Liberian Dan continue to say that their name originates from one of the ancient twelve tribes of Israel, as discussed in the Torah. The Dan people also live in Cote D'Ivoire and Guinea. The Dan language is related to the Mande group of African languages. Ganta has become the second-largest city in the country. Its population has grown as has its business class.  Healthcare  Access to quality healthcare in Nimba is lacking for many residents. As of 2008?, the hospital at Yekepa, built by LAMCO, is now being run by Arcelor-Mittal. In Sanniquellie, the County Referral Hospital is the George Way Harley Hospital. It is solely sponsored by the Ministry of Health, Nimba County. The county health officer is Dr. Collins S. Bowah, and the medical director of the County Referral Hospital is Dr. Lavela B. Kortimai, Jr. at Ganta. The Methodist Church runs a private hospital. E and J Hospital opened in 2016 in Ganta, Nimba County. At Saclepea, the Government of Liberia and Africare jointly operate Saclepea Comprehensive Health Center. There are 74 functional health facilities in Nimba County Health, of which there is one regional referral: Jackson F. Doe Hospital.

The show originated as a one-time segment on Love, American Style called \\"Love and the Old-Fashioned Father\\". The same pilot was later produced with a live cast (starring Van Johnson), but with no success. The show was the first primetime animated sitcom to run for more than a single season since The Flintstones more than ten years earlier and would be the only one until The Simpsons seventeen years later. The show was inspired by All in the Family.TV Guide: Wait Till Your Father Gets Home Premise The 48 episodes feature Tom Bosley as Harry Boyle, a long-suffering suburban everyman dad and restaurant equipment dealer. The Boyle family consists of father Harry; wife Irma (voiced by Joan Gerber); overweight teen feminist yet boy-crazy daughter Alice; lazy and perpetually unemployed long-haired post-adolescent son Chet who, like his sister, does not want to follow in the morals and values of his parents; and precocious, if rather mercenary, younger son Jamie (voiced by Willie Aames). Harry often bickers with the more liberal Alice and Chet over various social issues of the day, with Irma endeavoring to remain neutral while Jamie is more sympathetic to his father's beliefs. Despite it all, Harry loves his family, and usually tries to support them. Many of the stories revolve around the generation gap between Harry and his children, in which the series' sympathy is typically on his side, leading the character to usually win his arguments. Despite Harry's conservatism, it pales against that of his neighbor Ralph Kane, who is a John Birch-like ultra-right-wing, fanatically anti-communist who is obsessed with every absurd conspiracy theory and ridiculous urban legend. Following Ralph with his cause is senior citizen Sara Whittaker, whom he addresses as \\"Sergeant\\". They have both turned one end of the block into, basically, an armed camp. Although Harry considers Ralph a close friend, he is annoyed at Ralph's extreme attitudes and rarely hesitates to dispute his more ignorant opinions or preempt his more threatening ambitions. Like many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained a laugh track created by the studio.Iverson, Paul: \\"The Advent of the Laugh Track\\". Hofstra University archives; February 1994. For this show, the studio added a third belly laugh to add a little more \\"variety\\" (the only TV series made by Hanna- Barbera to have this added laugh). In addition, the laugh track was also slowed considerably. During the 1972–73 season, the DePatie–Freleng studio had an animated Saturday morning series called The Barkleys with a very similar family, only they were all dogs. Joan Gerber was also the voice of the \\"mom\\" on that show, Agnes. The Barkleys had married couple Arnie and Agnes, teenage kids Terry and Roger, and pre-teen Chester.

In a narrow legal sense, a transfer tax is essentially a transaction fee imposed on the transfer of title to property from one entity to another. This kind of tax is typically imposed where there is a legal requirement for registration of the transfer, such as transfers of real estate, shares, or bond. Examples of such taxes include some forms of stamp duty, real estate transfer tax, and levies for the formal registration of a transfer. In some jurisdictions, transfers of certain forms of property require confirmation by a notary. While notarial fees may add to the cost of the transaction, they are not a transfer tax in the strict sense of the term.  UK  In England and Northern Ireland, property transfers between living persons or other legal entities incur a Stamp Duty Land Tax. Similar provisions exist in Scotland and Wales. When property is transferred from the estate of a deceased person, Inheritance tax is payable on the value of the estate including any property portfolio in that estate, subject to a minimum value threshold.  United States  In some states, transfer tax is considered to be an excise tax. Transfer taxes can be levied at the federal, state and local levels, depending on the type of property being transferred.Investopedia. (2019). Transfer Tax. [online] Available at: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transfertax.asp [Accessed 29 Apr. 2019].  Real Estate  Real estate transfer tax can be appointed by the authorities of state, county or commune when a real estate property is being transferred within a certain jurisdiction. Subjected to the tax is usually the act of transfer of legal deeds, certificates and titles to a property that are being shifted between the seller and the buyer. The size of the tax is derived from value of the certain property, its classification and from how the property is going to be used, because the purpose of a property can often greatly affect its future value. Therefore, local and state government are permitted to collect the tax based not only on the size of a property, but also its intended purpose.InvestorWords.com. (2019). What is Classified Property Tax? definition and meaning. [online] Available at: http://www.investorwords.com/19022/classified_property_tax.html [Accessed 29 Apr. 2019]. Classification of properties allows states to put different taxes on different properties in a non-uniform manner. The different classifications are commonly based on either use or ownership. There are two main ways that a state uses to tax in a non-uniform manner and those are by imposing different rates of tax on different types of property, or a uniform rate of tax but giving different types of property a different percentage of value. In some states the buyer may be required to pay the tax if the seller either isn't able to pay themselves or is liberated from it.LILP. (2019). Property Tax Classification. [online] Available at: https://www.lincolninst.edu/research- data/data-toolkits/significant-features-property-tax/topics/property-tax- classification [Accessed 29 Apr. 2019]. In the United States, the term transfer tax also refers to Estate tax and Gift tax. Both these taxes levy a charge on the transfer of property from a person (or that person's estate) to another without consideration. In 1900, the United States Supreme Court in the case of Knowlton v. Moore, 178 U.S. 41 (1900), confirmed that the estate tax was a tax on the transfer of property as a result of a death and not a tax on the property itself. The taxpayer argued that the estate tax was a direct tax and that, since it had not been apportioned among the states according to population, it was unconstitutional. The Court ruled that the estate tax, as a transfer tax (and not a tax on property by reason of its ownership) was an indirect tax. In the wake of Knowlton the Internal Revenue Code of the United States continues to refer to the Estate tax and the related Gift tax as \\"Transfer taxes.\\" The real estate tax is not imposed by five of the United States of America and those are Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, North Dakota, and Wyoming. In this broader sense, estate tax, gift tax, capital gains tax, sales tax on goods (not services), and certain use taxes are all transfer taxes because they involve a tax on the transfer of title. The United States had a tax on sales or transfers of stock from 1914 to 1966. This was instituted in The Revenue Act of 1914 (Act of Oct. 22, 1914 (ch. 331, 38 Stat. 745)), in the amount of 0.02% (2 basis points, bips). This was doubled to 0.04% (4 bips) in 1932, in the context of the Great Depression, then eliminated in 1966.Joseph J.

Geologically, there are other undersea geomorphological features such as the continental shelves, the deep ocean trenches, and the undersea mountain ranges (for example, the mid-Atlantic ridge and the Emperor Seamounts) which are not considered to be part of the ocean basins; while hydrologically, oceanic basins include the flanking continental shelves and shallow, epeiric seas. History Older references (e.g., Littlehales 1930)Littlehales, G. W. (1930) The configuration of the oceanic basins Graficas Reunidas, Madrid, Spain, consider the oceanic basins to be the complement to the continents, with erosion dominating the latter, and the sediments so derived ending up in the ocean basins. More modern sources (e.g., Floyd 1991)Floyd, P. A. (1991) Oceanic basalts Blackie, Glasgow, Scotland, regard the ocean basins more as basaltic plains, than as sedimentary depositories, since most sedimentation occurs on the continental shelves and not in the geologically-defined ocean basins.Biju-Duval, Bernard (2002) Sedimentary geology: sedimentary basins, depositional environments, petroleum formation Editions Technip, Paris, Hydrologically some geologic basins are both above and below sea level, such as the Maracaibo Basin in Venezuela, although geologically it is not considered an oceanic basin because it is on the continental shelf and underlain by continental crust. Earth is the only known planet in the solar system where hypsography is characterized by different kinds of crust, oceanic crust and continental crust.Ebeling, Werner and Feistel, Rainer (2002) Physics of Self-Organization and Evolution Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany, page 141, Oceans cover 70% of the Earth's surface. Because oceans lie lower than continents, the former serve as sedimentary basins that collect sediment eroded from the continents, known as clastic sediments, as well as precipitation sediments. Ocean basins also serve as repositories for the skeletons of carbonate- and silica-secreting organisms such as coral reefs, diatoms, radiolarians, and foraminifera. Geologically, an oceanic basin may be actively changing size or may be relatively, tectonically inactive, depending on whether there is a moving plate tectonic boundary associated with it. The elements of an active - and growing - oceanic basin include an elevated mid-ocean ridge, flanking abyssal hills leading down to abyssal plains. The elements of an active oceanic basin often include the oceanic trench associated with a subduction zone. The Atlantic ocean and the Arctic ocean are good examples of active, growing oceanic basins, whereas the Mediterranean Sea is shrinking. The Pacific Ocean is also an active, shrinking oceanic basin, even though it has both spreading ridge and oceanic trenches. Perhaps the best example of an inactive oceanic basin is the Gulf of Mexico, which formed in Jurassic times and has been doing nothing but collecting sediments since then.Huerta, Audrey D. and Harry, Dennis L. (2012) \\"Wilson cycles, tectonic inheritance, and rifting of the North American Gulf of Mexico continental margin\\" Geosphere 8(2): pp. 374-385, first published on March 6, 2012, The Aleutian Basin is another example of a relatively inactive oceanic basin. The Japan Basin in the Sea of Japan which formed in the Miocene, is still tectonically active although recent changes have been relatively mild.Clift, Peter D.

There are hundreds of described species, found in all parts of the world (with 45 in the British Isles alone), and new species are discovered on a regular basis. Eupithecia species form the bulk of the group commonly known as pugs. They are generally small with muted colours and specific identification can be difficult. As a group they are easily identified by their narrow wings held flat at 90° to the body with the hindwings almost hidden behind the forewings. The larvae of many species feed on the flowers and seeds of their food plants rather than the foliage. Many species have a very specific food plant. Some Hawaiian Eupithecia are predators of other insects (E. orichloris, E. staurophragma, E. scoriodes). They mimic twigs but when sensitive hairs on their backs are triggered, they quickly grab the insects touching them. The defensive behavior of snapping may have pre-adapted Hawaii's ancestral Eupithecia for shifting to predation from feeding on pollen. Also, insect predators that behave in this way are lacking in Hawaii's fauna. Species This is a list of all described species.

Unlike normal registered instruments, no record is kept of who owns bearer instruments or of transactions involving transfer of ownership, enabling the owner, as well as a purchaser, to deal with the property anonymously. Whoever physically holds the bearer document is assumed to be the owner of the property, and the rights arising therefrom, such as dividends. Bearer instruments are used especially by investors and corporate officers who wish to retain anonymity. The OECD in a 2003 report concluded that the use of bearer shares is \\"perhaps the single most important (and perhaps the most widely used) mechanism\\" to protect the anonymity of a ship's beneficial owner.OECD 2003, p. 8. Physically possessing a bearer share accords ownership of the corporation, which in turn owns the asset. There is no requirement for reporting the transfer of bearer shares, and not every jurisdiction requires that their serial numbers even be recorded. However, ownership (or legal entitlement) is extremely difficult to establish in event of loss or theft. In general, the legal situs of the property is where the instrument is located. Bearer instruments can be used in certain jurisdictions to avoid transfer taxes, although taxes may be charged when bearer instruments are issued. In the United States, under the Uniform Commercial Code, a negotiable instrument (such as a check or promissory note) that is payable to the order of \\"bearer\\" or \\"cash\\" may be enforced (i.e. redeemed for payment) by the party in possession. The payee (i.e. the person named in the \\"pay to\\" line) may also convert an instrument into a bearer instrument by endorsing (signing) the back. In practice, however, many merchants and financial institutions will not pay a check presented for payment by anyone other than the named payee. Bearer shares are banned in some countries, because of their potential for abuse, such as tax evasion,David Leigh, James Ball, Juliette Garside and David Pegg, \\"Catalogue of malpractice endorsed by bankers laid bare in HSBC files,\\" The Guardian (Sunday 8 February 2015). Retrieved 10 February 2015. movement of funds, and money laundering. The United States ended federal tax deductions for interest paid on bearer bonds in 1982.  History  The first bearer securities in almost all countries were banknotes. Later, due to the monopolization of banknote issue by one or several banks (usually government ones), bearer instruments such as short-term bank loan obligations (certificates, vouchers, tickets) and long-term borrowing obligations of banks and corporations, bonds, were introduced. With the development of the joint- stock form of enterprises in the form of bearer securities, shares were also issued. Historically, the first appeared registered shares, and much later there were shares of the bearer. Their appearance was associated with the development of the stock exchange. The emergence of the first joint-stock companies can be attributed to the beginning of the 17th century: the Dutch East India Company in 1602 and after its success the English East India Company in 1613. The shares of these companies were, however, registered. The first bearer shares appeared with the establishment of John Law in France in 1717. By royal decree John Law was granted the right to establish a joint- stock bank with a fixed capital of 6 million francs, the Banque Générale, divided into 1,200 bearer shares of 5,000 francs each. In August 1717, Law established a new joint stock company, the Mississippi Company, with a fixed capital of 100 million, divided into 200,000 bearer shares to colonize the countries lying along the banks of the Mississippi River. However, Law's mercantilist policies saw him seek to establish large monopolies, leading to the Mississippi bubble. The bubble would ultimately burst in 1720, and on November 27 of that year, the Bank officially closed. Despite the first unfortunate experience, this form of participation in the joint-stock company as the acquisition of certificates of bearer shares became quite widespread in Europe. Today the main use of bearer instruments is in offshore financial centers for the purpose of hiding information about the real owner of the instrument.  Bearer shares  Bearer shares are called securities, an anonymous holder of which is recognized from the legal point of view as a full-fledged shareholder of the company with all relevant rights. This document does not contain any indication of the name and name of the owner. The rights certified by the bearer act are actually owned by the owner of this document. The owner of the bearer certificate is considered the owner of shares certified by a certificate. Neither the company nor the chairman of the meeting of shareholders entered in the company's register, nor the director, any official of the company and no other authorized person is required to find out the circumstances under which the certificate was placed by its owner, or to raise the question of the validity or eligibility of any company, any actions of the owner of the certificate of such action. A shareholder is a person who actually owns a share (a share certificate). Bearer shares are transferred by simply delivering the certificate to a new holder. When the bearer shares are sold, it is not required to make any transfer inscriptions on the share certificate: the share is transferred by the physical transfer of the certificate from the seller (the bearer of the share certificate) to the buyer. The transfer of the bearer shares means the transfer of the relevant rights to the company. In contrast, a registered share contains an indication of the identity of the shareholder - only this person, and no one else can be a shareholder of the company. The names of the owners are entered in the register of the company's shareholders (owners of bearer shares are not registered in the company's register), and any transfer of shares from one owner to another is carried out on the basis of a written document (for example, a contract of sale between the seller and the buyer).Information on the change of owners of registered shares is also reflected in the shareholder register. = Issue of bearer shares = Bearer share certificate The first and most important condition for the issue of bearer shares is the fact that this right should be provided by the legislation of the country of registration for this type of company. In addition, the right to issue certificates of shares to bearer must be fixed in the company's constituent documents. The decision to issue shares in offshore jurisdictions is taken by the company's director. And at the same time the share certificate is issued. A share certificate is the main document certifying the rights of the shareholder, in which the statutory information is mandatory: name of the issuer, certificate number, the amount of the capital, number of shares owned by the holder of this certificate, date of issue of the certificate. In the column where the owner of the action is to be indicated, the name \\"bearer\\" is given in place of the name. This means that the actual owner of this certificate is the person who has this certificate. The company's constituent documents, as a rule, provide for the procedure for signing a certificate. In most offshore jurisdictions, share certificates must be signed by the director or other authorized person of the company. = World trends in legislation = Until recently, there was no mechanism to control the movement of bearer shares. Registered agents, sending their agent company's constituent documents, together with the certificate of registration, the charter and the memorandum of association, passed, as a rule, the forms of certificates of shares. Questions about who owns these certificates, and how they are transferred, were not asked. However, in the past few years, economically developed countries, in particular the United States, as well as international organizations such as OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) and the FATF (Financial Action Task Force) have begun to put significant pressure on offshore jurisdictions. Their main claim was not even that there is preferential taxation in low-tax areas, but lack of transparency: there are no open registries, no indication of who really owns the companies. And although international organizations have no right to issue binding instructions, and can not apply sanctions, nevertheless, some offshore jurisdictions have begun to improve their legislation in accordance with the recommendations of such international organisations. The FATF reflected its main directions of the prevention of money laundering in the document \\"40 Recommendations\\". Recommendations were adopted in April 1990 and almost every year undergo some changes. Recommendations of the FATF establish measures to ensure the transparency of legal entities with a view to obtaining competent authorities access to information about the beneficial owner at any time. Changes in the legislation of offshore jurisdictions within the framework of these recommendations are most often related to the open register of shareholders and directors, cancellation of bearer shares, as well as information cooperation with management and control bodies. Offshore centers reacted to criticism of their use of bearer shares in different ways. In a number of low-tax jurisdictions, bearer shares were banned (Bahamas, Isle of Man, Jersey, Mauritius). Now companies are registered there, but in a much smaller number than in other offshore territories. Some jurisdictions have taken compromise measures: on the one hand they tried to comply with the requirements of international organizations, and on the other hand - the requirements of customers who register and use companies (British Virgin Islands and Belize). And some countries, formally agreeing to cooperate, nevertheless, did not make significant changes to their legislation (Seychelles). = Advantages and disadvantages of bearer shares = The main advantage for which registered companies with bearer shares earlier is confidentiality. Since at present information on holders of certificates of bearer shares is often needed to disclose even to one person, confidentiality can be called imaginary. Another advantage - the simplicity of transferring certificates of shares to the bearer is now also becoming more likely to become a drawback, namely, the insecurity of the owner from theft or loss. Any person who has acquired a certificate of bearer shares will be considered the owner of this certificate. The next drawback is the difficulty in opening a bank account. Some banks refuse to open accounts for companies that issued bearer shares, despite the fact that the client is ready to disclose all information about the owners of such shares, believing that this is contrary to their \\"know your client\\" policy. Some banks ask to deposit certificates of bearer shares with them. In addition, there may be difficulties in notifying shareholders about holding an annual meeting. As a rule, the procedure should be prescribed in the constituent documents. If a shareholder does not physically reside in this state, then it is likely that he simply will not find out about this fact. There can be a situation when the company wants to open an office in any country, and according to the legislation of this country it is necessary to confirm the fact of ownership of this company by the shareholder. A shareholder with certificates of bearer shares will not be able to confirm his rights, as his name is not indicated in the certificates.

Subspecies Subspecies include: * Ecphora gardnerae gardnerae, the nominate subspecies Geological history This species of large carnivorous sea snail lived during the Miocene epoch, and became extinct more than five million years ago. This species was previously known as Ecphora quadricostata, but that name is now restricted to a species which is found from Pliocene strata in Virginia to Florida. The Miocene-aged specimens found in Maryland have been assigned to a different taxon, Ecphora gardnerae.Ward & Gilinsky, 'Ecphora (Gastropoda: Muricidae) from the Chesapeake Group of Maryland and Virginia', Notulae Naturae, No. 469 (1988), p. 1, available on line here Life habits As with most other muricids, Ecphora sea snails bored holes through the hard shells of other mollusks, usually bivalves, or sometimes other snails, including other, smaller Ecphoras, in order to feed on their soft insides using a toothed, ribbonlike appendage (common to almost all gastropods) known as a radula.  Commemoration of the fossil In March 1994, Dr. Eric Seifter testified before the Maryland Legislature that the classification of the Maryland State Fossil, Ecphora quadricostata was invalid (quadricostata is not actually found in Maryland) and needed to be changed to Ecphora gardnerae gardnerae.

It belongs to the monotypic genus Malaclemys. It has one of the largest ranges of all turtles in North America, stretching as far south as the Florida Keys and as far north as Cape Cod. The name \\"terrapin\\" is derived from the Algonquian word .\\"Terrapin\\" at m-w.com It applies to Malaclemys terrapin in both British English and American English. The name originally was used by early European settlers in North America to describe these brackish-water turtles that inhabited neither freshwater habitats nor the sea. It retains this primary meaning in American English. In British English, however, other semi-aquatic turtle species, such as the red- eared slider, might also be called terrapins.. Description The diamond pattern of the turtle's back Adult female The common name refers to the diamond pattern on top of its shell (carapace), but the overall pattern and coloration vary greatly. The shell is usually wider at the back than in the front, and from above it appears wedge-shaped. The shell coloring can vary from brown to grey, and its body color can be grey, brown, yellow, or white. All have a unique pattern of wiggly, black markings or spots on their body and head. The diamondback terrapin has large webbed feet. The species is sexually dimorphic in that the males grow to a carapace length of approximately , while the females grow to an average carapace length of around , though they are capable of growing larger. The largest female on record was just over in carapace length. Specimens from regions that are consistently warmer in temperature tend to be larger than those from cooler, more northern areas.Davenport, John (1992).\\"The Biology of the Diamondback Terrapin Malaclemys Terrapin (Latreille)\\" , Tetsudo, 3(4) Male diamondback terrapins weigh on average, while females weigh around .http://www.dep.state.fl.us/coastal/sites/stmartins/pub/SMM_Terrapin_Report.pdf The largest females can weigh up to . =Adaptations to their environment= Terrapins look much like their freshwater relatives, but are well adapted to the near shore marine environment. They have several adaptations that allow them to survive in varying salinities. They can live in full strength salt water for extended periods, and their skin is largely impermeable to salt. Terrapins have lachrymal salt glands, not present in their relatives, which are used primarily when the turtle is dehydrated. They can distinguish between drinking water of different salinities. Terrapins also exhibit unusual and sophisticated behavior to obtain fresh water, including drinking the freshwater surface layer that can accumulate on top of salt water during rainfall and raising their heads into the air with mouths open to catch falling rain drops. Terrapins are strong swimmers. They have strongly webbed hind feet, but not flippers as do sea turtles. Like their relatives (Graptemys), they have strong jaws for crushing shells of prey, such as clams and snails. This is especially true of females, who have larger and more muscular jaws than males. =Subspecies= Seven subspecies are recognized, including the nominate race. *M. t. centrata (Latreille, 1801) – Carolina diamondback terrapin (Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina) *M. t. littoralis (Hay, 1904) – Texas diamondback terrapin (Texas) *M. t. macrospilota (Hay, 1904) – ornate diamondback terrapin (Florida) *M. t. pileata (Wied, 1865) – Mississippi diamondback terrapin (Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas) *M. t. rhizophorarum Fowler, 1906 – mangrove diamondback terrapin (Florida) *M. t. tequesta Schwartz, 1955 – East Florida diamondback terrapin (Florida) *M. t. terrapin (Schoepff, 1793) – northern diamondback terrapin (Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia) The isolated Bermudan population, which arrived in Bermuda on its own rather than being introduced by humans, has not yet been officially assigned to a subspecies but, based on mtDNA, it is closely related to the population from the Carolinas. Distribution and habitat Diamondback terrapins live in the very narrow strip of coastal habitats on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts of the United States, from as far north as Cape Cod, Massachusetts, to the southern tip of Florida and around the Gulf Coast to Texas. In most of their range, terrapins live in Spartina marshes that are flooded at high tide, but in Florida they also live in mangrove swamps. This turtle can survive in freshwater as well as full-strength ocean water, but adults prefer intermediate salinities. They have no competition from other turtles, although common snapping turtles do occasionally make use of salty marshes. It is unclear why terrapins do not inhabit the upper reaches of rivers within their range, as in captivity they tolerate fresh water. It is possible they are limited by the distribution of their prey.Coker, R. E. 1906. The natural history and cultivation of the diamond-back terrapin with notes of other forms of turtles. North Carolina Geological Survey Bulletin. 14:1-67 Terrapins live quite close to shore, unlike sea turtles, which wander far out to sea; however, a population of terrapins on Bermuda has been determined to be self-established rather than introduced by humans. Terrapins tend to live in the same areas for most or all of their lives, and do not make long distance migrations. Life cycle Adult diamondback terrapins mate in the early spring, and clutches of 4-22Brennessel, Barbara. \\"Diamonds in the Marsh,\\" Hanover: University Press of New England, 2006 eggs are laid in sand dunes in the early summer. They hatch in late summer or early fall. Maturity in males is reached in 2–3 years at around in length; it takes longer for females: 6–7 years (8–10 years for northern diamondback terrapins) at a length of around . =Reproduction= Like all reptiles, terrapin fertilization occurs internally. Courtship has been seen in May and June, and is similar to that of the closely related red- eared slider (Trachemys scripta). Female terrapins can mate with multiple males and store sperm for years,Barney, R.L. 1922. Further notes on the natural history and artificial propagation of the diamondback terrapin. U.S. Bureau of Fisheries. Economic Circular No. 5, rev. 91-111 resulting in some clutches of eggs with more than one father. Like many turtles, terrapins have temperature dependent sex determination, meaning that the sex of hatchlings is the result of incubation temperature. Females can lay up to three clutches of eggs/year in the wild, and up to five clutches/year in captivity. It is not known how often they may skip reproduction, so true clutch frequency is unknown. Females may wander considerable distances on land before nesting. Nests are usually laid in sand dunes or scrub vegetation near the ocean in June and July, but nesting may start as early as late April in Florida. Females will quickly abandon a nest attempt if they are disturbed while nesting. Clutch sizes vary latitudinally, with average clutch sizes as low as 5.8/eggs/clutch in southern FloridaBaldwin, J.D., L.A. Latino, B.K. Mealey, G.M. Parks, and M.R.J. Forstner. 2005. \\"The diamondback terrapin in Florida Bay and the Florida Keys: Insights into Turtle Conservation and Ecology\\". Chapter 20 In: In: W. E. Meshaka, Jr., and K. J. Babbitt, eds. Amphibians and Reptiles: status and conservation in Florida. Krieger Publishing Company, Malabar, Florida to 10.9 in New York. After covering the nest, terrapins quickly return to the ocean and do not return except to nest again. The eggs usually hatch in 60–85 days, depending on the temperature and the depth of the nest. Hatchlings usually emerge from the nest in August and September, but may overwinter in the nest after hatching. Hatchlings sometimes stay on land in the nesting areas in both fall and spring and they may remain terrestrial for much or all of the winter in some places. Hatchling terrapins are freeze tolerant, which may facilitate overwintering on land. Hatchlings have lower salt tolerance than adults and Gibbons et al. provided strong evidence that one- and two-year-old terrapins use different habitats than do old individuals. Growth rates, age of maturity, and maximum age are not well known for terrapins in the wild, but males reach sexual maturity before females because of their smaller adult size. In females at least, sexual maturity is dependent on size rather than age. Estimations of age based on counts of growth rings on the shell are as yet untested, so it is not clear how to determine the ages of wild terrapins. =Seasonal activities= Because nesting is the only terrapin activity that occurs on land, most other aspects of terrapin behavior are poorly known. Limited data suggest that terrapins hibernate in the colder months in most of their range, in the mud of creeks and marshes. Diet The diamondback terrapin typically feeds on fish, marine snails (especially the saltmarsh periwinkle),clams, mussels and other mollusks. At high densities the terrapin may eat enough invertebrates to have ecosystem-level effects, partially because periwinkles themselves can overgraze important marsh plants, such as cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora). Gender and age can greatly affect the diet of the diamondback terrapin, males and juvenile females tend to have less diversity in their diet. Adult females, due to their powerful, defined jaw, will occasionally feed on crustaceans such as crabs and are more likely to consume hard-shelled mollusks. Conservation A juvenile diamondback terrapin =Status= In the 1900s, the species was once considered a delicacy to eat and was hunted almost to extinction. The population also decreased due to the development of coastal areas, terrapins being susceptible to wounds from the propellers on motorboats. Another common cause of death is the trapping of the turtles in recreational crab traps, as the turtles are attracted to the same bait as the crabs. Due to these factors, the diamondback terrapin is listed as an endangered species in Rhode Island, a threatened species in Massachusetts and is considered a \\"species of concern\\" in Georgia, Delaware, Alabama, Louisiana, North Carolina, and Virginia. The diamondback terrapin is listed as a “high priority species” under the South Carolina Wildlife Action Plan. In New Jersey, it was recommended to be listed as a Species of Special Concern in 2001. In July 2016, the species was removed from the New Jersey game list and is now listed as non-game with no hunting season. In Connecticut, there is no open hunting season for this animal. However, it holds no federal conservation status.[citation needed] =Conservation status= The species is classified as Near Threatened by the IUCN due to decreasing population numbers in much of its range. There is limited protection for terrapins on a state-by-state level throughout its range; it is listed as Endangered in Rhode Island and Threatened in Massachusetts. The Diamondback Terrapin Working Group Diamondback Terrapin Working Group deal with regional protection issues. There is no national protection except through the Lacey Act, and little international protection. Diamondback terrapins are the only U.S. turtles that inhabit the brackish waters of estuaries, tidal creeks and salt marshes. With a historic range stretching from Massachusetts to Texas, terrapin populations have been severely depleted by land development and other human impacts along the Atlantic coast. Earthwatch Institute, a global non-profit that teams volunteers with scientists to conduct important environmental research, supports a research program called \\"Tagging the Terrapins of the Jersey Shore.\\" This program allows volunteers to explore the coastal sprawl of New Jersey's Ocean County on Barnegat Bay, one of the most extensive salt marsh ecosystems on the East Coast, in search of this ornate turtle. On this project, volunteers contribute to environmental sustainability in the face of rampant development. Veteran turtle scientists Dr. Hal Avery, Dr. Jim Spotila, Dr. Walter Bien and Dr. Ed Standora are overseeing this program and the viability of terrapin populations in the face of growing environmental change. =Threats= The major threats to diamondback terrapins are all associated with humans and probably differ in different parts of their range. People tend to build their cities on ocean coasts near the mouths of large rivers and in doing so they have destroyed many of the huge marshes that terrapins inhabited.Ner, S, and R.L. Burke. 2008. Direct and indirect effects of urbanization on Diamondback terrapins of New York City: Distribution and predation of terrapin nests in a human-modified estuary. J.C. Mitchell, R.E. Jung, and B. Bartholomew (eds.). Pp. 107-117 In: Urban Herpetology. Herpetological Conservation Vol. 3: Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles Nationwide, probably >75% of the salt marshes where terrapins lived have been destroyed or altered. Currently, ocean level rise threatens the remainder. Traps used to catch crabs, both commercially and privately, have commonly caught and drowned many diamondback terrapins, which can result in male-biased populations, local population declines, and even extinctions. When these traps are lost or abandoned (“ghost traps”), they can kill terrapins for many years. Terrapin-excluding devices are available to retrofit crab traps; these reduce the number of terrapins captured while having little or no impact on crab capture rates.Roosenburg, W.M. and J.P. Green. 2000. Impact of a bycatch reduction device on diamondback terrapin and blue crab capture in crab pots\\" Ecological Applications 10:882-889 In some states (NJ, DE, MD), these devices are required by law. Nests, hatchlings, and sometimes adultsare commonly eaten by raccoons, foxes, ratsHay, W.P. 1917. Artificial Propagation of the diamondback terrapin. Department of Commerce Bureau of Fisheries Economic Circular No. 5, revised. Pages 3-21and many species of birds, especially crows and gulls. Density of these predators are often increased because of their association with humans. Predation rates can be extremely high; predation by raccoons on terrapin nests at Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge in New York varied from 92-100% each year from 1998–2008, Burke unpubl. data). Terrapins are killed by cars when nesting females cross roads and mortality can be high enough to seriously affect populations. Terrapins are still harvested for food in some states. Terrapins may be affected by pollutants such as metals and organic compounds, but this has not been demonstrated in wild populations. There is an active casual and professional pet trade in terrapins and it is unknown how many are removed from the wild for this purpose. Some people breed the species in captivity and some color variants are considered especially desirable. In Europe, Malaclemys are widely kept as pets, as are many closely related species. Relationship with humans University of Maryland's Testudo statue In Maryland, diamondback terrapins were so plentiful in the 18th century that slaves protested the excessive use of this food source as their main protein. Late in the 19th century, demand for turtle soup claimed a harvest of 89,150 pounds from Chesapeake Bay in one year. In 1899, terrapin was offered on the dinner menu of Delmonico's Restaurant in New York City as the third most expensive item on the already- expensive menu. A patron could request either Maryland or Baltimore terrapin at a price of $2.50 (). Although demand was high, over capture was so high by 1920, the harvest of terrapins reached only 823 pounds for the year. According to the FAA National Wildlife Strike Database, a total of 18 strikes between diamondback terrapins and civil aircraft were reported in the US from 1990 to 2007, none of which caused damage to the aircraft.FAA National Wildlife Strike Database On July 8, 2009, flights at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York City were delayed for up to one and a half hours as 78 diamondback terrapins had invaded one of the runways. The turtles, which according to airport authorities were believed to have entered the runway in order to nest, were removed and released back into the wild.Turtles Delay Flights at JFK at the New York Post website A similar incident happened on June 29, 2011, when over 150 turtles crossed runway 4, closing the runway and disrupting air traffic. Those terrapins were also relocated safely.Mating turtles shut down runway at JFK at CNN.com The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey installed a turtle barrier along runway 4L at JFK to reduce the number of terrapins on the runway and encourage them to nest elsewhere. Nevertheless, on June 26, 2014, 86 terrapins made it onto the same runway, as a high tide carried them over the barrier. Their population is controlled by the raccoon population; it has been shown that as the raccoons decrease in number, mating terrapins increase, leading to increased turtle activity at the airport. Many human activities threaten the safety of diamondback terrapins. The terrapins get caught and drown in crab nets that humans put out, are suffocated by pollution that humans greatly contribute to, and lose their marsh and estuarine habitats because of urban development. =History as a delicacy= Diamondback terrapins were heavily harvested for food in colonial America and probably before that by Native Americans. Terrapins were so abundant and easily obtained that slaves and even the Continental Army ate large numbers of them. In the 19th century, a dish called \\"Terrapin à la Maryland\\", a stew with cream and sherry, was a canonical element, along with canvasback duck, of the elegant and regional \\"Maryland Feast\\" menu, an \\"elite standard...that lasted for decades\\".Paul Freedman, \\"Terrapin Monster\\", p. 51-64 of Dina Khapaeva, ed., Man-Eating Monsters: Anthropocentrism and Popular Culture, , p. 59 By 1917, terrapins sold for as much as $5 each (). Huge numbers of terrapins were harvested from marshes and marketed in cities. By the early 1900s, populations in the northern part of the range were severely depleted and the southern part was greatly reduced as well.Coker, R. E. 1931. The diamondback terrapin in North Carolina. In (ed) H. F. Taylor, Survey of Marine Fisheries of North Carolina. University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill, NC pp. 219-230 As early as 1902 the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries (which later became the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) recognized that terrapin populations were declining and started building large research facilities, centered at the Beaufort, North Carolina Fisheries Laboratory, to investigate methods for captive breeding terrapins for food.Wolfe, Douglas A. 2000. A History of the Federal Biological Laboratory at Beaufort, North Carolina 1899-1999. People tried (unsuccessfully) to establish them in many other locations, including San Francisco. =Use as a symbol= Maryland named the diamondback terrapin its official state reptile in 1994. The University of Maryland, College Park has used the species as its nickname (the Maryland Terrapins) and mascot (Testudo) since 1933, and the school newspaper has been named The Diamondback since 1921. The athletic teams are often referred to as \\"Terps\\" for short. The Baltimore baseball club entry in the Federal League during 1914 and 1915 was called the Baltimore Terrapins. The terrapin has also been a symbol of the Grateful Dead because of their song \\"Terrapin Station\\". Many images of the terrapin dancing with a tambourine appear on posters, T-shirts and other places in Grateful Dead memorabilia.

Their closest relatives are the purple frogs (Nasikabatrachidae) of India. Description All Sooglossidae species are relatively small terrestrial frogs, about in length, hiding under fallen leaves or in rock crevices. They are unusual for the neobatrachials, in that they undertake inguinal amplexus, a primitive version of amplexus. They lay their eggs on moist ground, rather than in water. Several species lack tadpoles, with the eggs hatching directly into froglets. The tadpoles of S. sechellensis are carried, abnormally, on the backs of the female frogs until metamorphosis.Encyclopedia of Animals:Mammals, Birds, Reptiles, Amphibians There is no fossil record for the family. They diverged from the Nasikabatrachidae when the Seychelles Islands split from India during the Late Cretaceous.

Center Stage began in a converted gymnasium in 1963 as a full arena theatre that seated 240 people. Today, Center Stage houses two performing spaces, the 541-seat Pearlstone and the smaller Head Theater, both in its home in the Mount Vernon Cultural District of Baltimore. History Launched in 1963 by a group of local theater supporters, Center Stage soon became a leader in America's regional theater movement, with the goal of producing first-rate professional theater for local audiences, along with theaters like The Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Arena Stage in Washington, and Alley Theatre in Houston. On January 10, 1974, an arson fire (which was noted to be set by two men who were forcibly removed from the next- door bar Benny Goodmans Beef And Beer and were out to burn it down for revenge, but accidentally mistook the Center Stage Theatre for the bar and set it ablaze in the back) burned its North Avenue home to the ground. In 1931 the North Avenue building was previously occupied by a theatre called The Peabody which opened in the early 1900s; in 1931 Orioles Cafeteria a local food chain restaurant moved into the space at 11 East North Avenue and moved out in August 1965 to make space for The Center Stage Theatre. After the building burned down in 1974 many decided that since the outer shell was not severely damaged some hope remained for salvage use, but the interior was completely destroyed and unstable, was considered unsafe by city inspectors and construction crews and was later demolished. Although the majority of the building was demolished, both sides of the facade columns remain to remind passerby's what was once there. Today the site of the North Avenue building is currently a small parking lot for used cars and auto repairing. Additional stage hands quickly rebuilt the set for Edward Albee’s Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf” for its performance the next night at the Baltimore Museum of Art and with help from local civic leaders the theater continued its season at the local College of Notre Dame (once a part of Loyola High School and College) and used the disaster to launch a major public relations and capital campaign to keep the organization alive. The theater ultimately moved into a new space carved out of an abandoned Jesuit college. Since that time, it has become Baltimore's leading professional theater, hosting more than 100,000 people each season to its home in Mount Vernon. In 2011, British playwright Kwame Kwei-Armah succeeded Irene Lewis as artistic director of Center Stage. Center Stage audiences became familiar with him in 2005 when Kwei-Armah’s most recognized work Elmina’s Kitchen held its American premiere at Center Stage. The play had previously debuted at the National Theatre in London in 2003, making Kwei-Armah the first Black Briton to have a play produced on the West End. The 2018/19 Season welcomed Artistic Director Stephanie Ybarra, an artistic producer most recently at The Public Theater. Center Stage has transitioned from a six play to a seven play season that includes a mix of comedy, drama, and musicals. Main stage performances occur in either the 541-seat Pearlstone Theater or the smaller, flexible-layout Head Theater. The Play Lab series features new work from emerging and established artists. Third Spaces brings theater to unexpected stages, such as the 2013 production of The Container, which placed a small audience inside a shipping container, and Fourth Spaces explores the relationship between technology and artistry, using the Center Stage interactive media wall to connect audiences and theater artists.

It is the most widely spoken form of Kurdish, and is a native language to some non-Kurdish minorities in Kurdistan as well, including Armenians, Chechens, Circassians, and Bulgarians. The earliest textual record of Kurmanji Kurdish dates back to approximately the 16th century and many prominent Kurdish poets like Ahmad Khani (1650–1707) wrote in this dialect. Kurmanji Kurdish is also the common and ceremonial dialect of Yazidis. Their sacred book Mishefa Reş and all prayers are written and spoken in Kurmanji.  Phonology  Phonological features in Kurmanji include the distinction between aspirated and unaspirated voiceless stops and the presence of facultative phonemes. For example, Kurmanji Kurdish distinguishes between aspirated and unaspirated voiceless stops, which can be aspirated in all positions. Thus contrasts with , with , with , with , and the affricate with .  Dialect continuum  Kurmanji forms a dialect continuum of great variability. Loosely, six subdialect areas can be distinguished: * Northwestern Kurmanji, spoken in the Kahramanmaraş (in Kurmanji: Meraş), Malatya (Meletî) and Sivas (Sêwaz) provinces of Turkey. * Southwestern Kurmanji, spoken in the Adıyaman (Semsûr), Gaziantep (Entab) and Şanlıurfa provinces of Turkey and the Aleppo Governorate of Syria. * Northern Kurmanji or Serhed Kurdish, spoken mainly in the Ağrı (Agirî), Erzurum (Erzerom) and Muş (Mûş) provinces of Turkey, as well as adjacent areas. * Southern Kurmanji, spoken in the Al-Hasakah Governorate in Syria, the Sinjar District in Iraq, and in several adjacent parts of Turkey centering on the Mardin and Batman provinces. * Southeastern Kurmanji or Badînî, spoken in the Hakkâri province of Turkey and Dohuk Governorate and parts of Erbil Governorate of Iraqi Kurdistan. * Anatolian Kurmanji is spoken in central Anatolia, especially in Konya, Ankara, Aksaray, by Anatolian Kurds =Ezdîkî and Yazidi politics= Among some Yazidis, the glossonym Ezdîkî is used for Kurmanji to signify an attempt to erase their affiliation to Kurds. While Ezdîkî is no different from Kurmanji, these efforts attempt to prove that Ezdîkî is an independent language which includes claims that it is a Semitic language. This has been criticized as not being based on scientific evidence and lacking scientific consensus. On January 25, 2002, Armenia ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages and placed Kurdish under state protection. However, because of the divided Yazidi community in Armenia and after strong criticism from parts of the community, the authorities chose to ratify the charter by mentioning both \\"Kurdish\\" and \\"Yezidi\\" as two separate languages. This resulted in the term Êzdîkî being used by some researchers when delving into the question of minority languages in Armenia, since most Kurdish-speakers in Armenia are from the Yazidi group. As a consequence of this move, Armenian universities offer language courses in both Kurmanji and Êzdîkî as two different dialects.

Similarly, a biweekly newspaper is published once every two weeks. Weekly newspapers tend to have smaller circulations than daily newspapers, and often cover smaller territories, such as one or more smaller towns, a rural county, or a few neighborhoods in a large city. Frequently, weeklies cover local news and engage in community journalism. Most weekly newspapers follow a similar format as daily newspapers (i.e., news, sports, obituaries, etc.). However, the primary focus is on news within a coverage area. The publication dates of weekly newspapers in North America vary, but often they come out in the middle of the week (Wednesday or Thursday). However, in the United Kingdom where they come out on Sundays, the weeklies which are called Sunday newspapers, are often national in scope and have substantial circulations (20 to 50 per cent higher on average than their daily sister publications). Other types of news publications come out weekly on newsprint but are not considered general newspapers. These cover specific topics, such as sports (e.g., The Sporting News) or business (e.g., Barron's), and have larger circulations and cover much larger geographic-coverage areas. Alternatively, other news publications come out weekly on magazine-style print but are still considered general newspapers (e.g. The Economist).  History  The first weekly newspapers were Relation and weekly newspaper Aviso, which were published at beginning of 17th century. The Relation started around 1605 in Straßburg by Johann Carolus and the Aviso started in January 1609 in Wolfenbüttel.Margot Lindemann: Deutschen Presse bis 1815. Geschichte der deutschen Presse Teil 1. [Abhandlungen und Materialien zur Publizistik Band 5], Colloquium, Berlin 1969, S. 86 Content Many weekly newspapers in North America follow a similar format: =News= News coverage usually focuses on local events such as car accidents or house fires, plus local government meetings, such as city councils or school boards, and police blotters. =Sports= A weekly newspaper often covers sports teams from one or more area schools (mostly high schools), communities, or professional teams if any exist. Often, a sports reporter takes great ownership in a specific team and writes stories containing detailed accounts of games. Several photographs of the games may accompany the story. Other stories preview games, usually between traditional rivals, to build interest. =Family news and obituaries= Family news pages include announcements of births, engagements, weddings, landmark birthdays and anniversaries, and obituaries. In the past, correspondents often submitted stories along the lines of \\"Mr. and Mrs. John Jones had company from out-of-town last week\\", although these types of stories - commonly called \\"Neighborhood News\\" or some similar name - are largely a thing of the past. =Features and reviews= Larger weeklies, especially those that are part of chains, also offer lifestyle features, reviews of local theater and arts, restaurant reviews and a food section that may concentrate on local recipes. =Editorial pages= Like daily newspapers, weekly newspapers often have an editorial page. Editorial pages also include letters to the editor, written by readers on a specific topic. =Public record= The public-record section usually includes summaries of police-incident reports, fire-department calls and court dispositions (or, the outcome of a criminal proceeding). Many newspapers also publish a list of building permits that have been issued in its circulation area. =Public notices= Public notices typically fall into one of two categories: * Notices about hearings, advertisements for bids, financial reports, adoption of ordinances, planning applications, and other government activities which local governments are required to notify the public. * Notices by the court system and/or law- enforcement agencies. These can include such things as lawsuits, divorce settlements and foreclosures/property repossession. Laws in many US states dictate that a municipality or other government body must designate a newspaper of record. The official newspaper is decided based on geographical area, and often more than one newspapers are given this designation. Official newspapers receive the government's public notices, and since they are considered advertising, it can be a source of revenue for newspapers. =Advertising= Weekly newspapers often have one or more advertising sales representatives whose job it is to sell display advertisements. Most advertisements are from local businesses (although some larger companies from outside the coverage area may advertise). Other advertisements are called classifieds, which are placed by people who want to buy or sell something (such as a car or real estate), employers who have job openings, or property owners who have rental property available. Along with paid subscriptions, a weekly newspaper receives most of its revenue from display advertising and classified advertising. Layout Most weekly newspapers are laid out one or more days before the publication date. Sometimes, the layout of pages is staggered, to allow for multiple deadlines. Like larger newspapers, most weekly newspapers these days are paginated (or laid out) using computer software, using programs such as Adobe PageMaker, Adobe InDesign or Quark Xpress. Layout is the appearance of the page and includes photographs (along with cutlines, or captions identifying the photograph's content and people), copy (the text and its typefont), headlines and white space. At many newspapers, photographers, reporters and editors use digital cameras to take photographs and download selected photographs using a card reader. The photographs are cropped and edited using a program such as Adobe Photoshop. After the copy and advertisements have been placed on the page, the editor will print out a proof and make any changes, if necessary. Sometimes, he or she will consult with reporters on such things as double-checking facts, proofreading headlines and other copy, or writing cut-lines for photographs. Once everyone is satisfied, a final proof is printed out and prepared for publication. The pages can be placed on dummy sheets, burned to a CD-ROM or Zip disk, or sent to the printing press (either located at the newspaper office or an off-site publication plant) by e-mail or FTP site. Staff Often, the staff of a weekly newspaper is smaller, with employees having several duties. For instance, a news editor may also sell advertising, while reporters could also be photographers. The size of the news staff varies, depending on the size of the newspaper and its circulation area. Some papers have a staff of several reporters, with each reporter having a specific beat (much like a daily newspaper, with beats including schools, local government, business, police, etc.). Many smaller newspapers, however, may have as few as one reporter to cover the entire circulation area, meaning they are responsible for the entire content of the newspaper (e.g., government, business, schools, crime, features, etc.). The experience of weekly newspaper reporters varies. Some may have years of experience (either they are satisfied where they are employed, and/or may be well-established in the community). Others may be recent college graduates early in their career, and are trying to gain experience and/or clips. Many newspapers have at least one news clerk or editorial assistant who is responsible for typing family news and obituaries, as well as news releases announcing upcoming events. A circulation manager keeps track of subscribers (this can range from only a couple hundred to tens of thousands of subscribers), and may also be in charge of classified advertising. As well as full-time staff reporters and photographers, many weekly newspapers also employ correspondents (sometimes called stringers), often paid on a per-story rate. Family-owned and chains Many weekly newspapers started as family-owned businesses, covering one or two communities and handling all editorial and business functions. The Tribune Newspaper in Humble, Texas is one example. Typically all business functions, along with the editor-in-chief would be family members, while non family members would assume reporting positions. Another example is the Campbell County Observerhttp://www.CampbellCountyObserver.net published in N.E. Wyoming. The owner is the publisher who also performs advertising sales, writing, distribution, books, and other duties that may be required. His wife, Candice, is an advertising saleswoman, his 9-year-old and 4-year-old children are the insert stuffers, and they all are door-to-door subscription salespeople. As newspapers became more expensive to operate and family members declined to join the business, many weekly newspapers were purchased by larger chains of weeklies. Some family-owned newspapers are operated as chains, with the family business operating weekly newspapers in multiple towns. The chain newspapers can be either regional or national chains. Sometimes all advertising functions are combined, with a weekly newspaper containing both ads for local businesses and for businesses in the chains area. This larger circulation can assist in bringing in national advertising to weeklies. Weeklies in chains may also have a publisher overseeing several newspapers, with a specific editor for each newspaper. Change of the day on them At Christmas, depending on the day of the week that Christmas Day, December 25th is on, weekly newspapers would change the day in many countries. For example, Sunday Newspapers are moved to Christmas Eve or Saturday when Christmas Day is on Sunday, and other weekly newspapers are expected to change their day at Christmas to save shops from opening on Christmas Day by law.

History Before World War II a main station entrance was built on the road bridge carrying Hounslow Road across the line -- this and a footbridge were demolished in the early 1990s. A former Red Star Parcels office is vacant space in the southerly station house. Construction of the booking hall and other facilities on the northern side was in the 1990s. The \\"new station\\" was built under the SWELTRAC partnership between local authorities, Heathrow Airport Ltd (part of BAA), and the rail industry which was intended to encourage use of public transport and to allow easy rail/bus interchange. The main building is at the western extremity of New Road, at the junction with a one-way section of Bedfont Lane, hard by the level crossing. Adjacent land used for railway purposes became a supermarket and a private sports facility. Services The typical hourly off-peak weekday service from the station is: * 6 to London Waterloo, of which: ** 2 call at only , Richmond, and ** 2 call at , Twickenham, Richmond, , Clapham Junction, and Vauxhall ** 2 call at all stations on the Hounslow Loop * 2 to , calling at all stations * 2 to , calling at all stations. * 2 to calling at then all stations.

Connections Map of Heathrow rail links =Heathrow Airport= Feltham station is one of the nearest National Rail stations to Heathrow Airport, especially to Terminal 4. Signs at the station and in timetables give Feltham as a connection for the airport. Buses to the airport run from the small bus station by the exit from Platform 1 and link directly to all five terminals. Route 285 serves Terminals 2&3, and route 490 serves Terminals 4&5, with the two routes serving the same stops up until Hatton Cross. A shuttle bus service to the airport was started in 1999 with two dedicated bus routes to the airport: Route T123 for terminals 1, 2 and 3, and route T4 for terminal 4. In 2000 T4 was withdrawn and the frequency of T123 reduced. Until 2008 their replacement was the existing route 285 which added a short detour to serve the station forecourt; passengers for terminal 4 were advised to change at Hatton Cross (which is in the Heathrow free travel zone with free travel between Hatton Cross and all terminals). In March 2008 terminal 5 opened and route 490 was diverted to serve it and to make the detour into Feltham station bus station. Hounslow Council is currently consulting on a direct rail link between the line and Terminal 5 of Heathrow. =Local= London Buses routes 285, 490 and H25 serve the station. Future Feltham lies on the route of the now abandoned Heathrow Airtrack plan proposed by BAA. A rail service would have run from Heathrow Terminal 5 to , and Guildford, replacing the airport bus service and providing a railway service directly from Feltham into the airport. BAA withdrew the Airtrack plan in 2011.

Zoë is equipped with tools and sensors to search for direct evidence of life beneath the surface of the ground. Zoë significantly aids in research needed to study Mars because it acts as a mobile observer and analyzer of any signs of life in a given location. She collects primary data which will help in understanding conditions present on Mars. This project will verify reliability of autonomous, mobile, and scientifically made robots.  Specifications  Zoë is a four-wheeled 220 kg rover with dimensions of approximately 2.9m in length, 2.9m in width, and a height of 2m. It achieves a top speed of 1 m/s with a turning radius of 2.5m Zoë carries a 3.5m2 Solar Panel with a maximum power generation of 1600W which allows it to move, activate computers and sensors, and charges the batteries.  Tools and Sensors  Zoë carries a one-meter long drill on its back. The drill will collect soil samples underground which will then be analyzed by other tools on board. This drill is able to collect soil samples underground with a maximum depth of 80 cm below surface. Zoë carries the Mars Microbeam Raman Spectrometer which is able to identify specific types of minerals in the subsurface. Other instruments include the Bio IV Fluorescence Imager which indicates the amount of natural fluorescence in soil and rocks, and detects chlorophyll-based-life; a sample carousel, which is used to store samples and used to deliver drill shavings to other instruments on-board; a colored- panoramic imager on a tilt unit, which captures high-resolution photographs up to 1mm/pixel resolution; a visible/near infrared Spectrometer, which transforms spectra to visible and near-infrared wavelengths; and includes environmental sensors which are able to detect weather conditions such as the temperature, humidity, wetness, and wind.  Functionality  * Solar powered * Sensors * Avoids rocks and slopes * Drives and steers  Life in the Atacama Desert  Zoë was placed in the driest Desert on earth, the Atacama Desert, which is also considered to be the most lifeless. Research on this habitat did not truly begin until interest rose for NASA’s astrobiology program. With much similar aspects to Mars, the Atacama Desert was proven to be a proper imitation of Mars. With this realization, scientists and researchers are dedicating their time to examine every part of the desert in hopes of finding microbial life.  Expeditions  In the fall of 2004, a team of scientists accompanied Zoë on a two-month expedition in the Atacama Desert so she wouldn’t “drive off a cliff” Zoë was placed in the Atacama Desert in 2005 for its first field expedition. During its time there, it was able to map out any living organisms. In 2013, Zoë returned to the Desert with a meter- long drill to produce research of any existing microbial life beneath the Desert’s surface.

History  The party was established in 1941 and took its present name in 1944. At its formation, it was a coalition of three pro-democracy parties and three pressure groups. Its two main goals were to support China's war effort during the Second Sino- Japanese War and to provide a \\"Third Way\\" from the Nationalists and the Communists. Influential members or supporters included Zhang Dongsun, Zhang Junmai (Carson Chang), Luo Longji, Pan Guangdan, Huang Yanpei, Fei Xiaotong, Li Huang of the Young China Party, Wu Han, Chu Anping, and Wen Yiduo.Roads Not Taken: The Struggle of Opposition Parties in Twentieth Century China, Edited by Roger B. Jeans. Boulder, Colorado: Westview Press, 1992. After the war, many Americans in China were sympathetic. Theodore White wrote that if \\"the men of the middle group were well organized, they could guarantee peace. But they are not. They lack an army, a political machine, roots in any social class. Only the spread of education and industry can create enough men of the modern world to give them a broad social base.\\"Theodore H. White and Annalee Jacoby, Thunder Out of China (NY: William Sloane Associates, Inc. 1946): 313. But disillusionment with the Nationalist government, which outlawed the party in 1947, and infiltration by the Communists caused the League to tilt towards the CCP during the Chinese Civil War. Thereafter, two of its constituent parties, the China National Socialist Party and the Chinese Youth Party, left the League to join the Nationalists in Taiwan. The \\"Third Party\\" eventually became the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party in 1947. It left the League, but kept its communist ideology. The three interest groups were the National Salvation Association, the Rural Reconstruction Association, and the Vocational Education Society. The NSA, by far the largest and most popular of the interest groups, was inspired by the National Salvation Armies and existed to encourage resistance against Japan, but became irrelevant after the war's end. The RRA was an agrarianist lobby formed from the Rural Reconstruction Movement, which was originally hostile to communism but their interests in peasant welfare gradually intersected. The third interest group, the Vocational Education Society, wanted to establish vocational schools throughout China and became the core of the China Democratic National Construction Association. Its chairperson Zhang Lan served as the vice chairman of Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China (1949–54).  Ideology  In 1997, it adopted a constitution, which stipulated that its program was \\"to hold high the banner of patriotism and socialism, implement the basic line for the primary stage of socialism, safeguard stability in the society, strengthen services to national unity and strive for the promotion of socialist modernisation, establishment and improvement of a market economy, enhancement of political restructuring and socialist spiritual civilisation, emancipation and development of productive forces, consolidation and expansion of the united patriotic front and realisation of the grand goals of socialism with Chinese characteristics.\\"  Composition  The League is mainly made up by middle-level and senior intellectuals in the fields of culture, education, science and technology. As of the end of 2012, the party had a membership of more than 282,000. Of this total, 22.8% were from the field of advanced education, 30.2% were from the field of compulsory education, 17.4% were in science and technology, 5.8% were in art and the press.

The company is headquartered in Glen Raven, North Carolina and headed by Leib Oehmig, who took over after Allen Erwin Gant, Jr., the grandson of John Quintin Gant and founder of the industry advocacy group National Council of Textile Organizations, retired. Glen Raven has operations in the United States, France, and China. History First trademark image of Zebra Stripes awning fabric, issued to Glen Raven Cotton Mills, 1908 John Quintin Gant entered the dry goods retail business in Company Shops, NC (Burlington) in 1872 and opened the John Q. Gant & Co. Gant sold his interest in the company in 1880 and then partnered with Berry Davidson to build the Altamahaw Cotton Mills in Alamance County, NC. The company was founded as John Q. Gant Manufacturing Co. in 1900 by John Quintin Gant (1847–1930), and by 1902, the company’s name was changed to Glen Raven Cotton Mills. The company began manufacturing cotton duck awning fabrics in 1908 and developing pantyhose in 1953. Panti-Tights and Panti-Legs are introduced as the first commercial ladies pantyhose in 1959. In 1965, Glen Raven developed a seamless pantyhose that became popular due to the introduction of the miniskirt. Glen Raven exited the hosiery business in 1996. The company was also known for making duck cloth used in tents for World War I and making tent canvas, power bags, and parachute cloth for World War II. Glen Raven claims to have woven the fabric used to make the first American flag that was planted on the moon at their weaving facility in Burnsville, NC. However, there is controversy and speculation whether the manufacturer of the fabric used in the American flag was made by Glen Raven or Burlington Industrial Fabrics. Glen Raven claims that they manufactured most of the nylon used in flags in the 1960s, while Burlington claims to have been the world’s largest textile company at the time. There is no clear documentation of where the flag was bought or who manufactured the fabric, and it still remains a mystery today. The company introduced acrylic-based fiber in 1961 with Sunbrella, which has vastly superior durability to cotton. Today, Sunbrella fabrics are used in a variety of applications including outdoor furniture, indoor furniture, boat covers, convertible automobile tops, and awnings. Glen Raven is best known for its Sunbrella line of performance fabrics. In 1998 Glen Raven merged with Dickson SA of France, founded by David Dickson (1811–1869), a Scotsman and Officer of the Legion of Honour. The company started production in a new manufacturing facility in China on September 21, 2006. In 2006, Sunbrella Awnings, Boat Tops, Canopies, and Umbrellas with Sun Protective Performance Fabrics UPF 50+ were awarded the \\"International Seal of Recommendation for UV Fabric/Umbrellas/Awnings\\" by The Skin Cancer Foundation, a worldwide organization dedicated to preventing skin cancer. Glen Raven acquired the Astrup Company (founded in Cleveland, Ohio in 1876 by William J.O. Astrup) and John Boyle & Company (founded in Brooklyn, New York in 1860 by John Boyle) in 2007. Strata Systems, Inc. was acquired as part of the purchase of John Boyle & Company, which itself, had previously acquired Strata Systems, Inc. The combined Astrup and John Boyle companies were renamed Tri Vantage in March 2008. Tri Vantage was rebranded as Trivantage in November 2012 with the tagline \\"Order. Done. Good Call.\\" In October 2017, Glen Raven acquired Sunbury Textile Mills, one of their strategic business partners for over twenty years. Sunbury will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Glen Raven and will operate as part of Glen Raven Custom Fabrics, LLC.

Typically, a (usually anonymous) reader writes to the media outlet with a problem in the form of a question, and the media outlet provides an answer or response. The responses are written by an advice columnist (colloquially known in British English as an agony aunt, or agony uncle if the columnist is male). An advice columnist is someone who gives advice to people who send in problems to the media outlet. The image presented was originally of an older woman dispensing comforting advice and maternal wisdom, hence the name \\"aunt\\". Sometimes the author is in fact a composite or a team: Marjorie Proops's name appeared (with photo) long after she retired. The nominal writer may be a pseudonym, or in effect a brand name; the accompanying picture may bear little resemblance to the actual author. The Athenian Mercury contained the first known advice column in 1690. Traditionally presented in a magazine or newspaper, an advice column can also be delivered through other news media, such as the internet and broadcast news media. History The original advice columns of The Athenian Mercury covered a wide scope of information, answering questions on subjects such as science, history, and politics. John Dunton, the bookseller who established The Athenian Mercury, enlisted experts in different fields to assist with the answers. As more people read the columns, questions on relationships increased. In 1704, Daniel Defoe began a public affairs journal, A Review of the Affairs of France. He used the name of a fictional society, the \\"Scandalous Club\\", as the \\"author\\" of a lighter section of the Review, and soon readers were sending 40-50 letters a week asking for advice from the Scandalous Club. At one point, Defoe complained of a backlog of 300 unanswered questions. Eventually, he spun off the letters-and-answers into a separate paper called the Little Review. A few years after the Little Review ended, The British Apollo newspaper provided advice to readers' questions in London. These have been compiled and published as The British Apollo: containing two thousand answers to curious questions in most arts and sciences, serious, comical, and humorous, approved of by many of the most learned and ingenious of both universities, and of the Royal-Society. Dix column, 1913 As Silence Dogood and other characters, Benjamin Franklin offered advice in the New England Courant and later in the Pennsylvania Gazette. The popular columnist Dorothy Dix began her column in 1896. Marie Manning started \\"Dear Beatrice Fairfax\\" in 1898. In 1902, George V. Hobart wrote a humorous advice column, \\"Dinkelspiel Answers Some Letters\\", in the San Francisco Examiner. In 1906, a column called \\"A Bintel Brief\\" ran in the Jewish Daily Forward in New York, which answered questions from new immigrants. From 1941 to her death in 1962, Eleanor Roosevelt wrote an advice column, If You Ask Me, first published in Ladies Home Journal and then later in McCall's. A selection of her columns was compiled in the book If You Ask Me: Essential Advice from Eleanor Roosevelt in 2018. An unusual advice column that foreshadowed internet forums was \\"Confidential Chat\\" in the Boston Globe. Launched in 1922 and published until 2006, readers both asked and answered questions without a columnist as intermediary. Advice columns proliferated in American newspapers early in the twentieth century as publishers recognized their value in capturing the interest of women, a key advertising demographic. An advice column for teenagers, \\"Boy Dates Girl\\" by Gay Head, started in Scholastic magazine in 1936. Advice columns specifically for teens became more common in the 1950s, such as \\"Ask Beth\\" which began in the Boston Globe and was then syndicated to fifty papers. More recently, advice columns have been written by experts in specific fields, such as Ask Dr. Ruth. Unlike the broad variety of questions in the earlier columns, modern advice columns tended to focus on personal questions about relationships, morals, and etiquette. However, despite the perception that sex was not a topic in advice columns early in the twentieth century, questions about sexual behavior, practices, and expectations were addressed in advice columns as early as the 1920s, although not in the explicit manner that can be found today. Many advice columns are now syndicated and appear in several newspapers. Prominent American examples include Dear Abby, Ann Landers, Carolyn Hax's Tell Me About It, and Daniel Mallory Ortberg's Dear Prudence. In the 1970s, the Chicago Tribune and New York Daily News Syndicate estimated that 65 million people read \\"Dear Abby\\" daily. As recently as 2000, both the Ann Landers and \\"Dear Abby\\" syndicated columns were published in over 500 newspapers. Internet sites such as the Elder Wisdom Circle offer relationship advice to a broad audience; Dear Maggie offers sex advice to a predominantly Christian readership in Christianity Magazine, and Miriam's Advice Well offers advice to Jews in Philadelphia. These days, men as advice columnists are rarer than women in print, but men have been appearing more often online in both serious and comedic formats. Influence on society Advice columns were not simply informational; from the days of The Athenian Mercury, they contributed to a sense of community in which readers not only learned from others' issues vicariously, but engaged with each other by offering their own answers to questions already published or by challenging advice given by the columnist. When people wrote letters, they were writing not only to the columnist, but also to their peers who would read about their problems. By discussing shared issues, advice columns contribute to a common understanding of mores and communal values. For example, as a community dialog, \\"A Bintel Brief\\" provided Eastern European Jewish immigrants with advice on adjusting to American life and helped bridge their disparate national cultures. David Gudelunas states \\"Newspaper advice columns in the twentieth century are just as much about community discussions as they were in the seventeenth century.\\" Readers took advantage of the anonymity of letters to advice columns to use it as a confessional. It gave them the opportunity to share information about themselves and their lives that, as many said in their letters, they were \\"too embarrassed\\" to tell people they knew. The advice column, with its views into the lives of others, became a tool in ventures as disparate as children's counseling and teaching English as a second language. A male British columnist felt that his column served several useful purposes: referrals to public services, education, and reassurance. He also noted the cathartic value to the letter writers. Due their national reach and popularity, advice columns could also be a tool for activism. In the 1980s, Ann Landers wrote an anti-nuclear column and encouraged her readers to clip it and forward it; over 100,000 letters were received by the White House. One million copies of her 1971 column supporting a cancer bill were sent to President Nixon. In fiction The \\"Agony Aunt\\" has become the subject of fiction, often satirically or farcically. Versions of the form include: * An agony aunt whose own personal problems and issues are more bizarre than those of her correspondents. A notable example is the British TV sitcom Agony created by Anna Raeburn, starring Maureen Lipman as the agony aunt with an overbearing mother, an unreliable husband, neurotic gay neighbours, and a career in media surrounded by self-promoting bizarros. Anna Raeburn herself works as an agony aunt on radio call-in shows, much as the main character of the sitcom does. * Mrs. Mills deliberately gives terrible advice to her clients, and is a satire of an agony aunt. * Another classic example of the agony aunt in fiction appears in Miss Lonelyhearts (1933) by Nathanael West. * In Evelyn Waugh's novel The Loved One, a Mr. Slump dispenses advice (on one occasion, it is lethal) under the name Guru Brahmin. * In Terry Pratchett's Discworld series, the Agony Aunts are elderly but violent enforcers for the Seamstress Guild, pausing in their pursuit of offenders only to shop for bargains at rummage sales. * In The Brady Bunch episode \\"Dear Libby\\", the six kids of a blended family see a problem similar to their family is having in an eponymous advice column, and worry their (blended) family may not survive. After all the children also post their questions to the column, the columnist herself visits the family and provides them relief by saying that the person who posted the original question did not come from this family. * Sherlock Holmes regularly consulted the \\"agony columns\\" of a number of newspapers, although at that time they seem to have been what we would call personal classified ads. In His Last Bow, \\"He took down the great book in which, day by day, he filed the agony columns of the various London journals.\\" In The Adventure of the Three Garridebs, \\"I should have thought, sir, that your obvious way was to advertise in the agony columns of the papers.\\" * The pilot episode of Drake and Josh has Josh play an advice columnist named Miss Nancy.

This may be important when determining which laws apply to the property, since the situs of an object determines the lex situs, that is, the law applicable in the jurisdiction where the object is located, which may differ from the lex fori, the law applicable in the jurisdiction where a legal action is brought. For example, real estate in England is subject to English law, real estate in Scotland is subject to Scottish law, and real estate in France is subject to French law. It can be essential to determine the situs of an object, and the lex situs, because there are substantial differences between the laws in different jurisdictions governing, for example: whether property has been transferred effectively; what taxes apply (such as inheritance tax, estate tax, wealth tax, income tax and capital gains tax); and whether rules of intestacy or forced heirship apply. The rules for determining situs vary between jurisdictions and can depend on the context. The English common law rules, which apply in most common law jurisdictions, are in outline as follows: *the situs of real estate (land) is where it is located. *the situs of a chattel (tangible moveable item) is where it is currently located. *the situs of a bearer instrument is where the document is located, but the situs of a registered instrument is where the register is held. *the situs of debts is where the debtor resides, since that is generally where legal action can be taken to enforce the debt. *the situs of intangible property, including intellectual property and goodwill, is where the property is registered, or, if not registered, where the rights to the property can be enforced. *the situs of a ship within territorial waters is where it is located, but the situs of a ship in international waters is its port of registry.

The origin of the term lies in the nomenclature that was adopted by the FIA for all of its post-World War II single-seater regulations, or formulae. The best known of these formulae are Formula One, Formula Two, Formula Three and Formula Four. Common usage of \\"formula racing\\" encompasses other single-seater series, including the GP2 Series, which replaced Formula 3000 (which had itself been the effective replacement for Formula Two). Categories such as Formula Three and FIA Formula 2 Championship are described as feeder formulae, which refers to their position below Formula One on the career ladder of single-seater motor racing. There are two primary forms of racing formula: the open formula that allows a choice of chassis or engines and the control or \\"spec\\" formula that relies on a single supplier for chassis and engines. Formula Three is an example of an open formula, while Formula BMW is a control formula. There are also some exceptions on these two forms like Formula Ford where there is an open chassis formula but a restricted single brand engine formula.

The first race to be run to the early Formula One regulations was a non-championship Grand Prix in Turin in September 1946. The first officially recognised Formula One season was held in 1947 and the World Championship for Drivers was inaugurated in 1950. This was the first example of formula racing. =Formula E= Formula E is the highest class of competition for single-seat, electrically powered racing cars, which held its inaugural season in 2014–15. Conceived in 2012, the championship was intended by the FIA to serve as an R&D; platform for the electric vehicle and promote interest in EVs and sustainability. The series races predominately on temporary circuits in cities such as New York, Hong Kong, Zürich, Berlin, Rome, and Paris in events known as \\"ePrix\\". In order to cap costs but maintain technological development, the series uses a spec chassis and battery that must be used by all entrants, with competing teams permitted to design and build their own motors, inverter and rear suspension. The series has gained significant traction in recent years.

In 2019, The GP3 Series has been renamed to Formula 3, just like GP2 did as Formula 2 in 2017. The series' first drivers champion is Robert Shwartzman driving for Prema Racing, who have also won the constructors championship for that year = Formula Three and Formula 4 =Formula Three Formula Three has a long history, with at least ten active championships around the world. It was created by the FIA in 1950 as the low cost entry point to single-seater formula racing. In 1959, it was replaced by a technically similar formula called Formula Junior, before Formula Three was reintroduced in 1964.British F3 Champions From motorsportsetc.com. Retrieved on 28 August 2007. Like the other FIA-derived formulae, F3 is an open class that permits a choice of chassis and engines. Notable championships include the FIA European Formula Three Championship, the British Formula Three Championship, and the All-Japan Formula Three Championship. Formula 4 FIA Formula 4, also called FIA F4, is an open- wheel racing car category intended for junior drivers. There is no global championship, but rather individual nations or regions can host their own championships in compliance with a universal set of rules and specifications. The category was created by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA)—the International sanctioning and administrative body for motorsport—as an entry-level category for young drivers, bridging the gap between karting and Formula 3. The series is a part of the FIA Global Pathway. Americas alt= Ana Beatriz during the 2008 Freedom 100 Indy Lights race at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Pro Mazda race at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca =IndyCar Series= The NTT IndyCar Series is the premier level of American open wheel racing. The series, founded by Indianapolis Motor Speedway owner Tony George, began in 1996 as the \\"Indy Racing League\\" (IRL). In 2008, the series merged with the rival Champ Car World Series, formerly known as CART, to form the IndyCar Series. The IndyCar Series is not an open formula. The league specifies the chassis, engine and tyre manufacturers, which are changed every three years. Currently, all teams run on Dallara chassis and Firestone tires and they can choose between a Honda and a Chevrolet engine. A typical IndyCar season usually contains a mixture of natural-terrain road courses, temporary street circuits, and short & high-speed ovals; including the historic Indianapolis 500. =Indy Lights= The current Indy Lights presented by Cooper Tires is the feeder series for the IndyCar Series, similar to F1's relationship with Formula 2. The original Indy Lights (known as \\"American Racing Series\\") acted as a developmental circuit for CART from 1986 to 2001. In 2001, the Toyota Atlantic series was equally effective in providing new drivers, so CART cancelled the Indy Lights. The current series was founded in 2002 by the Indy Racing League. It initially struggled to attract drivers and some races had fewer than ten entrants. However, with the introduction of road courses in 2005 and a boost in prize money in 2006, drivers like Marco Andretti and Phil Giebler were attracted to compete in the Indy Lights championships part-time, expanding the field to twenty or more cars in every race in 2007. As the spec car (a Dallara with a Nissan VRH35 engine) had been used since INDYCAR established the series in 2002, the number of drivers has decreased again with just nine drivers competing the entire season and so far eight other drivers running three or less races. A new Dallara IL-15 with an Advanced Engine Research 2-litre turbocharged 4-cylinder engine will be the specification starting in 2015. =Indy Pro 2000 Championship= The Indy Pro 2000 Championship presented by Cooper Tires has been a racing driver development series since 2011, when it became governed by Indy Racing League, although the original series started in 1991 as the Star Mazda Championship. Drivers currently use Formula Mazda cars built by Star Race Cars with a 250 hp Mazda 'Renesis' rotary engine and Cooper tyres. =U.S. F2000= Cooper Tires presents the U.S. F2000 National Championship powered by Mazda is an American variation of the Formula Ford. The series was initially founded by Dan Andersen and Mike Foschi in 1990 and regularly fielded over 60 entries per race. In 2001, the series was sold to Jon Baytos who introduced a number of controversial rule changes that brought the series out of alignment with similar SCCA classes, which led to a reduction in participation and the end of the series in 2006. In 2010, the series returned under the leadership of Andersen with the intent to return F2000 to its status as a feeder formula for higher open wheel racing classes in the United States. JapanSuper Formula= Koudai Tsukakoshi during the 2012 Formula Nippon race at Twin Ring Motegi Yuji Kunimoto during the 2010 All-Japan F3 race at Twin Ring Motegi The Super Formula, a.k.a. Formula Nippon, is the premier level of Japanese formula racing. It began as the Japanese Formula 2000 series in 1973 and continued to use Formula Two regulations after European Formula Two had ended in 1984. In 1987 the series switched to the Formula 3000 standard, so that Japanese and European regulations paralleled one another again. However, in 1996, the International Formula 3000 series became a one-make format to reduce costs and the Japanese Formula broke away, changing the series' name to Formula Nippon. Until recently, Formula Nippon was an open formula – chassis were supplied by Lola, Reynard and G-Force, while Mugen-Honda supplied most engines. However, in 2001/02 G-Force and Reynard withdrew and the series once again followed F3000's lead in becoming a one-make series. In 2006, the regulations were changed drastically – the chassis was replaced and the engines provided by Toyota and Honda had the same specifications as the engines used in the 2005 IndyCar Series. =All-Japan Formula Three= See: Formula Three =Formula Challenge Japan= The Formula Challenge Japan (FCJ) is promoted as a young driver development project jointly by Honda, Toyota and Nissan. It replaced the Formula Dream. The first season was in 2006 and carried on from the defunct Formula Dream series. Each participant needs to be younger than 26 years old and possess a National A racing license, but not having raced in Formula Three or above. The cars run on a Tatuus chassis, Dunlop and a 200 hp 2.0L engine, similar to that of a Formula Renault 2.0 car. As of 2009, the series supports the Formula Nippon. In 2015, the series will be replaced with Japan Formula 4.

Retrieved on 28 August 2007. It was not unusual for some Formula One events to include a number of F2 entries in the same field and the entries in the World Championship seasons of 1952–53 comprised exclusively F2 cars for reasons of cost. F2 had a patchy history until the inauguration of the European Formula Two Championship in 1967. F2 was an open formula that allowed the use of any chassis that met the prescribed regulations; it was well supported during the 1970s, with chassis from Tecno, March Engineering, Toleman, Ralt, Matra and others. The European championship ran continually until the creation of its successor, Formula 3000, in 1985. In 2008 it was announced by the FIA that Formula Two would return in 2009 in the form of the FIA Formula Two Championship. This series was discontinued after the 2012 season. =Formula 3000 (1985–2004)= The Formula 3000 was created by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile in 1985 to become the final step for drivers before entering Formula One. Formula Two had become too expensive and was dominated by works-run cars with factory engines. Formula 3000 offered quicker, cheaper, more open racing. The series began as an open formula, but in 1986 tyres were standardized, followed by engines and chassis in 1996. The series ran until 2004 and was replaced in 2005 by the GP2 Series. =International Formula Master (2005–2009)= International Formula Master, a.k.a. Formula Super 2000, was conceived as a competitor for Formula Three. It started in 2005 as the 3000 Pro Series, organised by Peroni Promotion. MTC Organisation took over in 2006 and turned it into a support series for the WTCC. Drivers used second-hand Formula 2000 cars made by Tatuus that were powered by a 250 hp Honda K20A engine. =A1 Grand Prix (2005–2009)= A1 Grand Prix (A1GP) was unique in its field in that competitors solely represented their nation as opposed to themselves or a team, the usual format in most formula racing series. As such, it was often promoted as the \\"World Cup of Motorsport\\". Also, the series attracted equal numbers of (former or future) Formula One drivers and IndyCar Series drivers. The concept was founded by Sheikh Al Maktoum of Dubai in 2004, but sold to the FIA in 2005. The races were held in the traditional Formula One off-season, the northern hemisphere winter. Between 2005 and 2009 29 countries from five continents participated. =Superleague Formula (2008–2011)= Using 750 hp V12 engines, Superleague Formula introduced team sponsorship by association football clubs. In qualifying, the link with football was also present as the series employed a system based on a group stage to knock-out format used in some football tournaments. Another unique feature of Superleague Formula was the Super Final, a five lap shootout between the six best drivers of a weekend. In 2010, the series offered the biggest prize fund in European motorsport with the champion set to earn €1 million. In theory, it would be possible for a driver to earn up to €2.2 million over the course of the season. This was all done to give drivers a chance to earn a living from motorsport. By 2011, the link with football was fading with more than half the teams no longer associated with football teams, The later races of the season did not take place, and no further seasons were organised. =Formula Dream (1999–2005)= See: Formula Challenge Japan =Formula V6 Asia (2006–2009)= Formula Asia V6 (Renault) was launched in 2006 to give Southeast Asian-based drivers a chance to progress from karting through junior single seaters to international motorsport. Karun Chandhok, for example, won the 2006 championship and was rewarded with a test in a World Series by Renault car at Paul Ricard. Drivers ran with Tatuus chassis, a Renault 3.5L V6 engine and Michelin tyres. =Auto GP (1999)= The Auto GP World Series' roots can be traced back to 1999 and the Italian Formula 3000 series. At first, nearly all races were held in Italy, but the series expanded throughout Europe quickly. In 2001 the series became European Formula 3000 and in 2004 Superfund became the title sponsor, planning to set up the Formula Superfund series. However, the funding was pulled and the series was cancelled. Therefore, Coloni Motorsport re- established the Italian Formula 3000 and expanded this in 2006 to the Euroseries 3000. In 2010, the first-generation A1 Grand Prix cars replaced the Lola F3000 chassis and the Auto GP name was adopted.

The seat of the municipality is the village Asprangeloi.Kallikratis law Greece Ministry of Interior It has an area of some 1,000 square kilometers and contains 46 villages known as Zagori villages (or Zagorochoria or Zagorohoria), and is in the shape of an upturned equilateral triangle. Ioannina, the provincial capital, is at the southern point of the triangle, while the south-western side is formed by Mount Mitsikeli (1,810m). The Aoos river running north of Mt Tymphe forms the northern boundary, while the south-eastern side runs along the Varda river to Mount Mavrovouni (2,100m) near Metsovo. The municipality has an area of 989.796 km2. The population of the area is about 3,700, which gives a population density of 4 inhabitants per square kilometer, very sparse when compared to an average of 73.8 for Greece as a whole.  Geography  Zagori is an area of great natural beauty, with striking geology and two National Parks, one including the river Aoos and the Vikos Gorge, the other around Valia Kalda, to the east of the imposing snow-capped Mt Tymphe. The 46 or so villages of Zagori were interconnected by mountain roads and traditional arched stone bridges until modern roads were opened in the 1950s. The stone arched bridges were built by benefactions from expatriate merchants in the 18th century and replaced older wooden bridges.  History  Dragonlake and Gamila summit (2497m.) Voidomatis river, Vikos-Aoos National Park. The region has been historically difficult to access due to its mountainous terrain which likely contributed to its unique character. The Sarakatsani people who can be found in this area use several Greek words of a Northern Greek dialect not commonly found in Greek elsewhere.Νικόλαος Κατσαρός – Οι αρχαιοελληνικές ρίζες του Σαρακατσάνικου λόγου They are consequently considered by some as indigenous to the area. = Early history = The first evidence of human presence in the area is dated between 17,000 and 10,000 years ago.Amanatidou: p. 32 Important epipaleolithic artifacts have been unearthed from Kleidi Cave on the banks of Voidomatis. In antiquity, the region of Zagori was inhabited by the Tymphaeans and formed a part of the ancient kingdom of the Molossians, a Greek tribe of Epirus that gained control over all of Epirus in classical times. The Molossian royal house ruled Epirus from the ancient town of \\"Molossis\\" which was located near modern Konitsa, in the northern boundary of Zagori, where the rivers Voidomatis, Aoös and Sarantaporos come together. The Molossians were known among else for a breed of great mastiffs they used to guard their flocks from wolves and bears and which were even used in war. Molossus, their eponymous ancestor, was said to have been born of a union between Neoptolemus (son of Achilles ) and Andromache (the wife of Hector of Troy). Neoptolemus, also called Pyrrhus for his blond hair, was first in a line of Epirotan kings leading to the king Pyrrhus of Hellenistic times who launched several campaigns against the Romans in Italy. Olympias, the mother of Alexander the Great, was a Molossian princess. Remains of cyclopean walls in Skamneli also testify to the antiquity of human occupation. During the 9th–4th centuries B.C., a small Molossian settlement existed between Monodendri and Vitsa, including stone houses and two cemeteries which have yielded important findings.Prefectural Committee of Tourist Promotion: p. 14 Additionally, foundations of fortifications and graves from the Hellenistic period have been found in Skamneli. However, throughout most of the historical time the local population was sparse.Amanatidou: p. 34 = Byzantine period = The Despotate of Epirus (in green) from 1230 to 1251. Monastery of Saint Paraskevi (Vikos). The passage of the Slavs during the early Byzantine period is testified to by numerous placenames. The placename \\"Zagori\\" itself is probably derived from the Slavic Zagore meaning \\"beyond the mountains\\". Under the Byzantine Empire, Zagori occasionally attracted groups of soldiers who built villages and settled there. Several monasteries were royal endowements, including the monastery of Votsa near the village of Greveniti and the monastery of the Transfiguration near Kleidonia, founded in the 7th century by the Byzantine Emperor Constantine IV Pogonatus and the monastery of St John of Rogovou near Tsepelovo founded in 1028 by the sister of Emperor Romanos III Argyros. From 1204 to 1337 the region was part of the Despotate of Epirus. In the 14th century, when various Albanian clans made incursions into Epirus, Zagori was the source of soldiers that served in the Ioannina garrison. As a result of the campaigns of Andronikos III Paleologos in 1337, the Despotate of Epirus and, therefore, Zagori along with Ioannina and the surrounding region came again briefly under Byzantine rule. The region came under Serbian rule in 1348 and the Despotate of Epirus was reformed and was under Latin rule by Carlo II Tocco when Ioannina and Zagori fell to the Turks in 1430, at the time of Sultan Murad II. Zagori (which then only consisted of 14 villages) «bowed the knee», which meant in practice that there were obligations between delegations of the two sides and a sum in tax was agreed upon in exchange for very considerable privileges: autonomy, administrative independence, and a ban on Turks crossing the borders into the area. = Ottoman period = The Zagorisian League or Koinon of the Zagorisians (Κοινόν Ζαγορισίων) was formed after the treaty of 1431 with Sinan-Pasha. At that point the arrangement that granted local autonomy was called “Voiniko”. The autonomy guaranteed non- interference in the local affairs by the Ottoman overlords. Zagorisians had their affairs entrusted to a Council of Elders called Demogerontia (Δημογεροντία), headed by a president or governor called Vekylis (Βεκύλης). As part of the treaty they maintained a force of Sipahi cavalry (σπαχήδες), with each village contributing a number of horsemen to that force according to its means.Constantinos Paparrigopoulos History of the Hellenic Nation 6 volumes, 1860–1877. The villages of Eastern Zagori, inhabited by Aromanian Vlachs, entered the Treaty in 1480. Consequently, many toponyms in northern and eastern Zagori have Aromanian etymology, while some toponyms with Slavic etymology are present in western and southern Zagori. Nevertheless, Zagori retained much of its Greek character through its system of government and the benefactions of its expatriates that favoured Greek education. The Koinon of the Zagorisians was reformalised by a treaty signed in 1670, under which Zagori enjoyed considerable privileges called Surutia, which were only rescinded fully by the Sultan in 1868. This solution suited the conquerors and the conquered, as it added statutory rules to the geographical factors which had made Zagori a natural refuge. Consequently, Zagori was never broken up to be shared out among Turkish landowners. Its economy flourished thanks to expatriate merchants active in Romania, Ukraine, Russia and Constantinople, who through remittances to their families and numerous benefactions contributed to the relative prosperity Zagori enjoyed during the period of Turkish rule. Schools for boys and from the 18th C onwards also for girls were built, in addition to watermills to grind the corn as well as new churches, while the water wells were often decorated with ornamental fountains. In the 17th century, the villages of Western Zagori were also admitted to the Treaty, so that by 1678 the total number of villages in Zagori had increased to 60. Traditional medicine flourished in the form of “Vikos doctors”, who gathered herbs for their preparations from the Vikos gorge. The growing prosperity, aided by privileges obtained by Phanariotes of Zagorisian descent and benefactions from expatriates, allowed the building of several schools, some still surviving, for example the Common School of Greek Studies (Greek: Κοινή Σχολή Ελληνικών Μαθημάτων) in Monodendri built by the brothers Manthos and Georgios Rizaris (1835). The brothers also funded the building of the Rizareios Ecclesiastical School in Athens (1844), while Zagori itself was under full Ottoman rule. The brothers Ioannis and Demetrios Anagnostopoulos from Dilofo founded the Anagnostopouleios in their home village and contributed to the expenses for the Zosimaia School in Ioannina. Michael Anagnostopoulos from Papingo built the Kallineios School in Papingo and the Anagnostopouleios School in Konitsa.Βασίλης Μηνακάκης Ζαγοροχώρια (Zagorochoria)’’ Exlporer, Athens, 2006 As a result of the numerous schools, the Greek language was preserved in the area. As the mountains were outside the direct rule of the Ottoman Empire, they offered a haven for Greeks on the run from the Ottoman authorities. Several prominent scholars of the Greek Enlightenment, such as Neofytos Doukas, Georgios Gennadios and Athanasios Psalidas sought refuge here, after the Sultan’s army destroyed Ioannina in 1820. Some among them even made plans to set up a university in the monastery of St John of Rogovou, near Tsepelovo.Frangoulis, Odysseas T., ‘’Το Σκαμνέλι. Συμβολή στην ιστορία του, ήθη – έθιμα – παραδόσεις (Skamneli, a Contribution to its History: Cultural Practices, Customs, and Traditions)’’, published by the Association of Skamneliots in Zagori, Ioannina 1988Ευριπίδης Γιαννάκος ‘’Το Μοναστήρι του Αγιάννη στο Ρογκοβό (The Monastery of St John of Rogovou)’’ Εκδόσεις Το Ζαγόρι μας, Ioannina 1985 In 1820, after the rebellion of Ali Pasha, a Turkish force of 1500 under Ismael Pasha arrived in Zagori, part of the total army of 20,000 sent against Ali Pasha. Alexis Noutsos from Kapesovo, a member of the Philike Hetairia, was in command of the force opposing Ismael Pasha. However, the Sultan's armies prevailed. Ismael Pasha removed most privileges other than the right to appoint a local governor (Vekylis), whose powers however became nominal. Ismael Pasha introduced very heavy taxation, amounting to 250 silver coins per person and additional taxation in kind. Zagori was liberated in 1913 during the Balkan Wars. = Modern period = View of Aristi village. Following the union with Greece after the Balkan Wars, the area suffered a demographic decline partly due to emigration to Greek urban centres. The area of Epirus around Zagori bore the brunt of the Italian attack on Greece in 1940. The area became additionally affected by the conflicts between the Germans and the partisans of Napoleon Zervas during the Second World War. At that time several of the villages of Zagori and the monastery of Votsa were burned in German reprisals. Most of the villages became deserted during the Greek Civil War of 1946–49. Since the 1980s, state initiatives aim to preserve the traditional character of the villages and the natural landscape.  Folklore  Unique customs are associated with ancient Greek, pagan or Christian festivals. The larger churches and monasteries celebrate their nominal saint feast with a festival that can last several days. Characteristic songs of mourning (moirologia) accompany the lamentation of the dead. Funerary rites include the exhumation of the bones of the deceased following a period of 1–3 years. The bones are washed, perfumed and placed in a wooden larnax and kept in ossuaries in each village.  Traditional architecture  Skamneli village, example of Epirotic architecture. Central square of Skamneli village. Villages are built around a central square, also called mesochori (village centre) with a large church, a plane tree and a public fountain. Cobbled streets and footpaths interconnect the rest of the village. Each individual neighbourhood has a smaller church. = Churches = Most churches in Zagori date from the 17–18th centuries onwards, although some older foundations survive. In most villages the main church consists of a sizeable basilica built of stone with a wooden roof covered by slate. They are decorated by mainly Epirotan iconographers in the Byzantine tradition. The entrance to the church may be protected by a colonnaded arcade. The campanile is usually detached from the church. = Houses = Houses until the 18th century were simple rectangular dwellings, often with only a ground floor and with ancillary areas in the basement used as stables. Indeed, this appears to be the style of construction of the dwellings in the excavated Molossian site near Vitsa. Houses are built of local stone and have a roof made of stone tiles (either of limestone or sandstone) which are held together without cement, only by the weight of the tiles above them. The stone roof therefore requires continual upkeep, subjected as it is to heavy snowfalls during the winter months. That older type was developed through the 18–19th centuries into more complex styles all the way to the multi-storied manors of the wealthier families of the late 18th century. Many houses are fronted by a walled courtyard or garden. The courtyard gate is an edifice in itself, covered by a stone roof and connecting the house to the rest of the village. In addition to the house, there are ancillary buildings, usually a “mageirio” (kitchen), an external toilet at the furthest corner from the kitchen, and stables. The main house is built with walls up to a meter thick that may have an internal sand compartment for insulation against the cold. The house entrance opens into the foyer called “hagiati” which leads to adjoining rooms called “ondas” or “mantzato”. The hagiati originally was and sometimes still is a partially open area in front of the house. The name is probably derived from the Persian word Hayāt, a style of Persian garden with pavilions or other edifices. The mantzato is the main room for the winter months with a fireplace, a “tavla” (table) and seating areas that can be used as beds, called “basia”. Opposite the fireplace there is a walled closet called “mesantra”. As an aid to its function, the mantzato often has a location in the south of the house. A usually wooden staircase leads from the hagiati to the upper floor landing called “krevatta”. This is a space between the bedrooms. In rare cases, the krevatta opens into a small balcony covered by a wooden roof. “Glavané” is a small entrance to the attic. The basement of the house contains cellars and other storage areas that may be used as additional quarters for animals. Few of the old manors survive, most having fallen victim to disrepair. In those that survive, the ondas room is the most spacious, has a large fireplace and may have floral frescoes. It was used for the reception of guests. = Bridges = More than 160 arched bridges were built in the greater area of Zagori, many of which still stand helping travelers to cross the numerous rivers and streams of the region. They were mostly built during the 18th and 19th centuries by local master craftsmen using local stone. These bridges usually have one to three arches called \\"kamares\\" in Greek. One of the most iconic is the three arched bridge of Plakidas, also known as Kalogeriko, near the village of Kipoi (Κἠποι).  The Vikos Gorge  The Vikos Gorge or Vikos Canyon at the heart of the Vikos–Aoös National Park, is the most impressive natural feature of the region. A seasonal river runs through the Vikos Gorge which is about 38 km long. The deepest part of the gorge is about 12 km long. In the middle of its main part, far from road access or villages, it is traversed by Megas Lakkos, an equally deep secondary gorge. The Voidomatis river has its source in the Vikos Gorge and then continues to flow through its own smaller gorge into the river Aoös. The Vikos Gorge at 990m deep near Monodendri while Mt Tymphe, in which it lies, is 1350 m at its highest peak. It is one of the deepest gorges in the world, indeed the deepest in proportion to its width. The Vikos Gorge is also a site of major scientific interest, because it is in an almost pristine natural condition, untouched by human activity. It is a haven for endangered species and contains many and varied ecosystems. File:Vikos Gorge from Beloe.jpgVikos Gorge from Beloe. File:2011 Dimos Zagoriou.pngMunicipality of Zagori.

The Smurls' claims gained wide press attention and were investigated by demonologists who encouraged the family's supernatural beliefs, and clergy, psychologists, and scientific skeptics who offered more parsimonious explanations. The Smurls' version of their story was the subject of a 1986 paperback titled The Haunted and a 1991 made-for-TV movie of the same name released by 20th Century Fox.  History  The Smurls moved into a double-block house on Chase Street in West Pittston, Pennsylvania in August 1986.Scinto, Sarah. \\"Jack Smurl, famous for haunting story, dies at age 75\\", Wilkes-Barre Citizens’ Voice, June 24, 2017 They claimed that the premises was disturbed by a demon that caused loud noises and bad odors, threw their dog into a wall, shook their mattress, pushed one of their daughters down a flight of stairs, and physically and sexually assaulted family members on several occasions. In 1986, the family brought in a pair of demonologists, Ed and Lorraine Warren. According to Ed Warren, the demon that inhabited the Smurls home was \\"very powerful\\" and it shook mirrors and furniture after they tried to persuade it to leave by playing religious music and praying. Warren claimed he felt a drop in temperature and saw a \\"dark mass\\" form in the home, and the demon once left a message on a mirror telling him to \\"get out\\". After months of investigation, Warren alleged that he had a number of audiotapes containing knocking and rapping caused by the demon. Professor Paul Kurtz of State University of New York at Buffalo and then-chairman of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal said the Warrens weren’t objective, independent, or impartial investigators and characterized the Smurls' claims as “a hoax, a charade, a ghost story.” Kurtz said that the family's claims were possibly due to delusions, hallucinations or brain impairment, and advised that they submit themselves to psychiatric and psychological examinations. Jack Smurl told a newspaper reporter he had \\"surgery to remove water from his brain in 1983 because he had been experiencing short-term memory loss due to a case of meningitis in his youth.\\" Allentown psychologist Robert Gordon commented that “people often look at demonology to explain many tensions that they experience as individuals and within their families”. Spokespeople for the Roman Catholic Church, Diocese of Scranton said they were unsure what might be causing the disturbances. St. Bonaventure University theology professor Alphonsus Trabold, OFM, said there might be other \\"less demonic\\" explanations. The home was blessed by several priests who said they saw \\"no harmful activity while on the property.\\" Janet Smurl claimed an unidentified priest performed three “unsuccessful” exorcisms, and that the demon avoided the rites by \\"moving between the double-block home\\" and following the family to other locations. In 1986, a priest from the local diocese spent two nights at the Smurl home and said \\"nothing unusual happened\\" during his stay there. In 1986, the Smurls told the press they were tired of the constant media bombardment; however within a few months, they had authored (along with Ed and Lorraine Warren and Scranton newspaper writer Robert Curran) a paperback book version of their story called The Haunted published by St. Martin’s Press. The book was criticized by reviewers such as Wilkes- Barre Times Leader staff writer Joseph Marusak who wrote, “Robert Curran forsakes the principles of his trade to give readers a one-sided account of what did or didn’t occur over several years in Jack and Janet Smurl’s former home”. Reviewer Mary Beth Gehrman wrote that the book was poorly written, adding that “it is hard to conceive of a supposedly sophisticated objective and (as far as I know, at least until now) credible reporter like Curran taking their story seriously given the complete lack of any empirical or physical evidence to support it.” That same year, the pastor of Immaculate Conception Parish in West Pittston, Rev. Joseph Adonizio, said the Smurls felt that after intense prayers, \\"things are back to normal.” In 1987, Janet Smurl told reporters that they still heard knocking and saw shadows. After the Smurl family moved to Wilkes-Barre, Debra Owens moved into the former Smurl home in 1988 and told reporters she \\"never encountered anything supernatural while living there.\\" In 1991, a two-hour made-for-TV movie titled The Haunted was released by 20th Century Fox, written by Curran, the Warrens, and the Smurls, and starring Jeffrey DeMunn as Jack Smurl and Sally Kirkland as Janet Smurl.

The commission was established in accordance with the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines. Established by Republic Act No. 7104 of 1991, the commission is a replacement for the Linangan ng mga Wika sa Pilipinas (LWP) that was set up in 1987 which was a replacement of the older Surian ng Wikang Pambansa (SWP), established in 1937 as the first government agency to foster the development of a Philippine national language. History The 1st National Assembly of the Philippines passed Commonwealth Act No. 184, s. 1936, establishing an Institute of National Language (Surian ng Wikang Pambansa). On January 12, 1937, Former President Manuel Luis Quezón y Molina appointed the members to compose the INL. By virtue of Executive Order No. 134 issued and signed by President Quezón on December 30, 1937, approved the adoption of Tagalog as the basis of the national language, and declared and proclaimed the national language based on Tagalog, as the national language of the Philippines. In 1938, the INL was dissolved and replaced with the National Language Institute. Its purpose was to prepare for the nationwide teaching of the Tagalog-based national language (Wikang Pambansa na batay sa Tagalog) by creating a dictionary and a grammar book with a standardized orthography. In the School Year of 1940-41, the teaching of the national language (Wikang Pambansa), with its new standardized orthography, was set by law in the fourth year of all high schools in both public and private schools throughout the country. The Tagalog-based national language was taught in school only as one of the subject areas in 1940 but was not adapted as the medium of instruction. During the Second World War, the Japanese occupiers encouraged the use of the national language rather than English in the schools. The Tagalog-based national language was, therefore, propagated not only in education but also in mass media and in official communication. The census for 1948 reported that 7,126,913 people or 37.11% of the population spoke the language, representing an increase of 11.7% from the 1939 figure of 4,068,565. Of these seven million people, 47.7% learnt it as a second language. The current commission was established by Republic Act No. 7104 of 1991, replacing the Institute of Philippine Languages (IPL) that was previously set up in January 1987 (Executive Order No. 117); itself, a replacement of the older Institute of National Language (INL), established in 1937. In October 2018, the KWF announced in its newsletter Diyaryo Filipino (Filipino Newspaper) its bringing online a National Dictionary in compliance with the commission's National Orthography of 2013: Diksiyonaryo. According to the same October 2018 newsletter, also in the works (in experimental and pilot-testing stage) is an official spellcheck in accordance with the Ortograpiyang Pambansa (National Orthography) and the Manwal sa Masinop na Pagsulat (Manual to Provident/Neat/Careful Writing).

Añonuevo - Director General of the Commission Language diversity The Philippines is one of the most linguistically diverse countries in the world. With 175 distinct native languages (sometimes incorrectly termed dialects), it has about 3% of the world’s languages, yet only 0.2% of Earth’s land area, making the Philippines 15 times more diverse than average in terms of language diversity. Ethnologue, a compendium of world languages, notes that 28 Philippine languages are in trouble, up from 13 in 2016. Eleven languages are dying, and several are already extinct. The Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages has identified the Philippines as being one of the top 10 “language hotspots” of the world, which means that the Philippines has a wealth of languages but such languages are being lost at a rate faster than those languages can be documented properly. Ethnologue’s estimates are conservative, as many linguists have noted that many endangered languages in the Philippines. All 32 Negrito languages of the Philippines are endangered (Headland, 2003), and the Komisyon sa Wikang Filipino has identified approximately 50 endangered languages. Endangered Filipino Languages List A 2015 study by the Commission updated the list of endangered languages in the Philippines. The Commission noted that there are 37 languages in the country that are now endangered, mostly Aeta languages in Luzon and Visayas, notably Negros Occidental. The Kinarol-an language Barangay Carol-an, Kabankalan, Negros Occidental was considered as extinct as it was no longer being used in casual conversations. The study also noted that the Inagtâ Isaróg language of Goa, Ocampo and Tigaon in Camarines Sur had only one remaining speaker in 2015. The Árta language of Nagtipunan, Quirino is considered nearly extinct as only 11 persons are speaking the language. Languages that are moribund (near extinction) include: the Inatá language of Cadiz City, Negros Occidental; Álta language of Aurora, Nueva Ecija; and Ayta Magbukun language of Abucay, Bataan. The Ayta Magbukun has at least 114 practicing families, while the others range from only 29 to 113 persons. Meanwhile, the threatened languages with more than a thousand speakers remaining are Álta Kabulowán of Gabaldon, Nueva Ecija; Ayta Mag-Indí of Pampanga and Zambales; and Gubatnón Mangyán of Magsaysay, Occidental Mindoro. Those that have lessening usage include Inagta Irayá of Buhi, Camarines Sur; Binaták of Palawan; Manidé of Camarines Norte; Ayta Kadí of Quezon Province; Ayta Ambalá of Zambales and Bataan; Ayta Mag- antsi of Tarlac, Nueva Ecija, and Zambales; Ténap (Agta Dupaningan) of Cagayan and Isabela; Bolinaw of Pangasinan; Agta Dumagat Casiguran of Isabela and Aurora; and Agtâ Dumagat Umíray of Quezon Province. Part also of the list are languages which the KWF consider as under threat and needing further studies. These are Manobo Kalamansíg of Sultan Kudarat; Ratagnón Mangyán of Occidental Mindoro; Îguwák of Nueva Vizcaya; Karáw of Benguet; Tagabulos of Aurora, Bulacan, and Quezon Province; Bangon Mangyán of Oriental Mindoro; Manobo Ilyanen of Cotabato; Gâdang of Mountain Province; Kalamyanën of Palawan; Tadyawan Mangyán of Oriental Mindoro; Finallíg of Barlig, Mountain Province; Menuvú of Bukidnon; Tawbuwíd Mangyán of Occidental and Oriental Mindoro; Manóbo Arománën of Cotabato; Manóbo Tigwahánon of Bukidnon; and Abéllen of Tarlac. Also listed under threat is the Irungdungan (Agta Isirigan) of Cagayan but the KWF observes a rising number of speakers. The Commission, with the much-needed cooperation and initiated of provincial and local governments, embarked on a landmark project on language revitalization in Abucay, Bataan in 2018, helping the Ayta Magbukun communities in the town’s village of Bangkal through Bahay Wika where young members of the ethnic group are being taught of their language by two elders. Criticism One major criticism of the commission is that it supposedly fails in its goal of further developing the Filipino language. This is grounded in the fact that Filipino is essentially Tagalog, a fact acknowledged by former Commissioner, Ricardo María Durán Nolasco, and with an impoverished technical and scientific vocabulary, at that, which relies heavily on foreign borrowings and, often, constructions. It is often left to the universities to develop their own respective terminologies for each field, leading to a lack of uniformity and general public disuse. It is arguedCongressional Record : Plenary Proceedings of the 14th Congress, First Regular Session : House of Representatives , Vol. 1, No. 11, August 14, 2007, pp. 455-460 (Rep. López opens the discussion) that current state of the Filipino language is contrary to the intention of Republic Act (RA) No. 7104 that requires that the national language be developed and enriched by the lexicon of the country's other languages. However, Resolution 92-1,Resolution No. 92-1 : Description of basic Filipino language, pbworks.com which defines the national language as \\"the language spoken in Metro Manila and other business centers of the country\\", does not necessarily run counter to RA No. 7104.

Mercator places Sibir correctly at about 58° northern latitude, but somewhat too much to the west.Shown about four degrees of longitude due east of Perm. Mercator is also mistaken about hydrology, placing Perm in the Ob basin and depicting the Irtysh as flowing southward. He is using a prime meridian at about 25° W, so that Sibir ends up at close to 100° E. Qashliq, Isker or Sibir (Siberian Tatar language: Sibir, Qaşliq or Esker) was a medieval (14th–16th century) Siberian Tatar fortress, in the 16th century the capital of the Khanate of Sibir, located on the right bank of the Irtysh River at its confluence with the Sibirka rivulet, some 17 km from the modern city of Tobolsk. The fortress is first mentioned in Russian sources of the 14th century.Istoriia Sibiri s drevneishikh vremem do nashikh dnei, Leningrad, 1968, cited after The Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 3rd Edition (1970–1979). The period of the most development was in the first half of the 16th century. In 1582 the troops of Cossack ataman Yermak seized and ruined Qashliq. The ruined city was retaken by the Siberian Tatars in 1584 only to be lost forever in 1586. The nearby city of Tobolsk was founded in 1587. Sources differ on the exact location of the fortress. Most give the distance upriver from Tobolsk as 17 or 18 km, or versts, or ten to eleven miles, but others give 23 km. Sources of the early 19th century claim that the ruins of the fortress could still be made out with difficulty.e.g. J. Bell, A system of geography, popular and scientific, 1832, p. 70. T. Curtis, The London encyclopedia, 1829, p. 288 The ruins of Qashliq, when they were still visible, were also referred to as The Fort of Kuchum by Russians. The modern village of Sibiryak () is located close to the site.

It was designed by Hungarian engineer György Jendrassik in 1937, and was intended to power a Hungarian twin-engine heavy fighter, the RMI-1. Design and development Following the running of an experimental gas turbine engine of 100 bhp output, in 1937 György Jendrassik began work on a turboprop engine, which would be produced and tested in the Ganz works in Budapest. Of axial- flow design with 15-stage compressor and 7-stage turbine, it incorporated many modern features. These included a rigid compressor-turbine rotor assembly carried on front and rear bearings. There was a single annular combustion chamber, of reverse-flow configuration to shorten the engine, air cooling of the turbine discs and turbine blades with extended roots to reduce heat transfer to the disc. The annular air intake surrounded a reduction gear for propeller drive takeoff, and the exhaust duct was also annular.Green, W. and Swanborough, G.; \\"Plane Facts\\", Air Enthusiast Vol. 1 No. 1 (1971), Page 53. With predicted output of 1,000 bhp at 13,500 rpm the Cs-1 stirred interest in the Hungarian aircraft industry with its potential to power a modern generation of high-performance aircraft, and construction was begun of a twin- engined fighter-bomber, the Varga RMI-1 X/H, to be powered by it. The first bench run took place in 1940, becoming the world's first turboprop engine to run. However, although the design was inherently sound, combustion problems were experienced which limited the output to around 400 bhp.Gunston World, p. 111 There was nothing inherently wrong with the design, however, and continued work on the flame cans should have allowed it to develop to full power. Work on the engine stopped in 1941 when the Hungarian Air Force selected the Messerschmitt Me 210 for the heavy fighter role, and the engine factory converted over to the Daimler-Benz DB 605 to power it. The prototype RMI-1 was later fitted with these engines in 1944.

Intermediate empires such as the Parthians and Kushans, seeking to maintain lucrative control over the silk trade, inhibited direct contact between these two Eurasian powers. In 97 AD, the Chinese general Ban Chao tried to send his envoy Gan Ying to Rome, but Gan was dissuaded by Parthians from venturing beyond the Persian Gulf. Several alleged Roman emissaries to China were recorded by ancient Chinese historians. The first one on record, supposedly from either the Roman emperor Antoninus Pius or his adopted son Marcus Aurelius, arrived in 166 AD. Others are recorded as arriving in 226 and 284 AD, with a long absence until the first recorded Byzantine embassy in 643 AD. The indirect exchange of goods on land along the Silk Road and sea routes included Chinese silk, Roman glassware and high- quality cloth. Roman coins minted from the 1st century AD onwards have been found in China, as well as a coin of Maximian and medallions from the reigns of Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius in Jiaozhi in modern Vietnam, the same region at which Chinese sources claim the Romans first landed. Roman glassware and silverware have been discovered at Chinese archaeological sites dated to the Han period. Roman coins and glass beads have also been found in Japan. In classical sources, the problem of identifying references to ancient China is exacerbated by the interpretation of the Latin term Seres, whose meaning fluctuated and could refer to several Asian peoples in a wide arc from India over Central Asia to China. In Chinese records, the Roman Empire came to be known as Daqin or Great Qin. Daqin was directly associated with the later Fulin () in Chinese sources, which has been identified by scholars such as Friedrich Hirth as the Byzantine Empire. Chinese sources describe several embassies of Fulin arriving in China during the Tang dynasty and also mention the siege of Constantinople by the forces of Muawiyah I in 674–678 AD. Geographers in the Roman Empire such as Ptolemy provided a rough sketch of the eastern Indian Ocean, including the Malay Peninsula and beyond this the Gulf of Thailand and South China Sea. Ptolemy's Cattigara was most likely Óc Eo, Vietnam, where Antonine-era Roman items have been found. Ancient Chinese geographers demonstrated a general knowledge of West Asia and Rome's eastern provinces. The 7th-century AD Byzantine historian Theophylact Simocatta wrote of the contemporary reunification of northern and southern China, which he treated as separate nations recently at war. This mirrors both the conquest of Chen by Emperor Wen of Sui (reigned 581–604 AD) as well as the names Cathay and Mangi used by later medieval Europeans in China during the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty and Han-Chinese Southern Song dynasty.

A Renaissance reconstruction of Ptolemy's 11th Asian regional map with the Gulf of the Ganges to the left, the Golden Peninsula (Malaysia) in the centre, and the Great Gulf (Gulf of Thailand) to the right; the land of the Sinae is positioned on its northern and eastern shores. Map of Eurasia in 1 AD, with the Roman Empire (red), Parthian Empire (brown), Chinese Han Empire (yellow), and Indian kingdoms, smaller states (light yellow) Beginning in the 1st century BC with Virgil, Horace, and Strabo, Roman histories offer only vague accounts of China and the silk- producing Seres people of the Far East, who were perhaps the ancient Chinese.Lewis (2007), p. 143. The 1st-century AD geographer Pomponius Mela asserted that the lands of the Seres formed the centre of the coast of an eastern ocean, flanked to the south by India and to the north by the Scythians of the Eurasian Steppe. The 2nd-century AD Roman historian Florus seems to have confused the Seres with peoples of India, or at least noted that their skin complexions proved that they both lived \\"beneath another sky\\" than the Romans.Ostrovsky (2007), p. 44. Roman authors generally seem to have been confused about where the Seres were located, in either Central Asia or East Asia.Schoff (1915), p. 237. The historian Ammianus Marcellinus (c. 330 – c. 400 AD) wrote that the land of the Seres was enclosed by \\"lofty walls\\" around a river called Bautis, possibly a description of the Yellow River. The existence of China was known to Roman cartographers, but their understanding of it was less certain. Ptolemy's 2nd-century AD Geography separates the Land of Silk (Serica) at the end of the overland Silk Road from the land of the Qin (Sinae) reached by sea.Yule (1915), pp. 1–2, 11. The Sinae are placed on the northern shore of the Great Gulf (Magnus Sinus) east of the Golden Peninsula (Aurea Chersonesus, Malay Peninsula). Their chief port, Cattigara, seems to have been in the lower Mekong Delta. The Great Gulf served as a combined Gulf of Thailand and South China Sea, as Marinus of Tyre and Ptolemy's belief that the Indian Ocean was an inland sea caused them to bend the Cambodian coast south beyond the equator before turning west to join southern Libya (Africa).Raoul McLaughlin (2010), pp. 58–59.Suárez (1999), p. 92. Much of this is given as unknown lands, but the north-eastern area is placed under the Sinae.Wilford (2000), p. 38; Encyclopaedia Britannica (1903), p. 1540. Classical geographers such as Strabo and Pliny the Elder were slow to incorporate new information into their works and, from their positions as esteemed scholars, were seemingly prejudiced against lowly merchants and their topographical accounts. Ptolemy's work represents a break from this, since he demonstrated an openness to their accounts and would not have been able to chart the Bay of Bengal so accurately without the input of traders.Parker (2008), p. 118. In the 1st-century AD Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, its anonymous Greek-speaking author, a merchant of Roman Egypt, provides such vivid accounts of eastern trade cities that it is clear he visited many of them. These include sites in Arabia, Pakistan, and India, including travel times from rivers and towns, where to drop anchor, the locations of royal courts, lifestyles of the locals and goods found in their markets, and favourable times of year to sail from Egypt to these places to catch the monsoon winds.Schoff (2004) [1912], Introduction. Retrieved 19 September 2016. The Periplus also mentions a great inland city, Thinae (or Sinae), in a country called This that perhaps stretched as far as the Caspian. The text notes that silk produced there travelled to neighbouring India via the Ganges and to Bactria by a land route. Marinus and Ptolemy had relied on the testimony of a Greek sailor named Alexander, probably a merchant, for how to reach Cattigara (most likely Óc Eo, Vietnam). Alexander (Greek: Alexandros) mentions that the main terminus for Roman traders was a Burmese city called Tamala on the north-west Malay Peninsula, where Indian merchants travelled overland across the Kra Isthmus to reach the Perimulic Gulf (the Gulf of Thailand). Alexandros claimed that it took twenty days to sail from Thailand to a port called \\"Zabia\\" (or Zaba) in southern Vietnam.McLaughlin (2014), p. 205.Suárez (1999), p. 90. According to him, one could continue along the coast (of southern Vietnam) from Zabia until reaching the trade port of Cattigara after an unspecified number of days (with \\"some\\" being interpreted as \\"many\\" by Marinus). Cosmas Indicopleustes, a 6th-century AD Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Greek monk from Alexandria and former merchant with experience in the Indian Ocean trade, was the first Roman to write clearly about China in his Christian Topography (c. 550 AD).Yule (1915), p. 25. He called it the country of Tzinista (comparable to Sanskrit Chinasthana and Syriac Sinistan from the 781 AD Nestorian Stele of Xi'an, China), located in easternmost Asia.Yule (1915), p. 28.Lieu (2009), p. 227. He explained the maritime route towards it (first sailing east and then north up the southern coast of the Asian continent) and the fact that cloves came that way to Sri Lanka for sale. By the time of the Eastern Roman ruler Justinian I (r. 527–565 AD), the Byzantines purchased Chinese silk from Sogdian intermediaries. They also smuggled silkworms out of China with the help of Nestorian monks, who claimed that the land of Serindia was located north of India and produced the finest silk.Luttwak (2009), p. 168. By smuggling silkworms and producing silk of their own, the Byzantines could bypass the Chinese silk trade dominated by their chief rivals, the Sasanian Empire. From Turkic peoples of Central Asia during the Northern Wei (386–535 AD) period the Eastern Romans acquired yet another name for China: Taugast (Old Turkic: Tabghach). Theophylact Simocatta, a historian during the reign of Heraclius (r. 610–641 AD), wrote that Taugast (or Taugas) was a great eastern empire colonised by Turkic people, with a capital city northeast of India that he called Khubdan (from the Turkic word Khumdan used for the Sui and Tang capital Chang'an), where idolatry was practised but the people were wise and lived by just laws.Yule (1915), pp. 29–31; footnote #3 on p. 31. He depicted the Chinese empire as being divided by a great river (the Yangzi) that served as the boundary between two rival nations at war; during the reign of Byzantine Emperor Maurice (582–602 AD) the northerners wearing \\"black coats\\" conquered the \\"red coats\\" of the south (black being a distinctive colour worn by the people of Shaanxi, location of the Sui capital Sui Chang'an, according to the 16th-century Persian traveller Hajji Mahomed, or Chaggi Memet).Yule (1915), p. 30; footnote #2 on p. 30. This account may correspond to the conquest of the Chen dynasty and reunification of China by Emperor Wen of Sui (r. 581–604 AD). Simocatta names their ruler as Taisson, which he claimed meant Son of God, either correlating to the Chinese Tianzi (Son of Heaven) or even the name of the contemporary ruler Emperor Taizong of Tang (r. 626–649 AD).Yule (1915), p 29; footnote #4 on p. 29. Later medieval Europeans in China wrote of it as two separate countries, with Cathay in the north and Mangi in the south, during the period when the Yuan dynasty led by Mongol ruler Kublai Khan (r. 1260–1294 AD) conquered the Southern Song Dynasty.Haw (2006), pp. 170–171.Wittfogel & Feng (1946), p. 2.Yule (1915), p. 1. =Chinese geography= An early Western Han silk map found in tomb 3 of Mawangdui Han tombs site, depicting the kingdom of Changsha and Kingdom of Nanyue (Vietnam) in southern China (with the south oriented at the top), 2nd century BC Daqinguo () appears at the Western edge of this Ming dynasty Chinese world map, the Sihai Huayi Zongtu, published in 1532 AD. Detailed geographical information about the Roman Empire, at least its easternmost territories, is provided in traditional Chinese historiography. The Shiji by Sima Qian (c. 145–86 BC) gives descriptions of countries in Central Asia and West Asia. These accounts became significantly more nuanced in the Book of Han, co-authored by Ban Gu and his sister Ban Zhao, younger siblings of the general Ban Chao, who led military exploits into Central Asia before returning to China in 102 AD. The westernmost territories of Asia as described in the Book of the Later Han compiled by Fan Ye (398–445 AD) formed the basis for almost all later accounts of Daqin.For the assertion that the first Chinese mention of Daqin belongs to the Book of the Later Han, see: Wilkinson (2000), p. 730. These accounts seem to be restricted to descriptions of the Levant, particularly Syria. Historical linguist Edwin G. Pulleyblank explains that Chinese historians considered Daqin to be a kind of \\"counter-China\\" located at the opposite end of their known world.Pulleyblank (1999), p. 71.See also Lewis (2007), p. 143. According to Pulleyblank, \\"the Chinese conception of Dà Qín was confused from the outset with ancient mythological notions about the far west\\". The Chinese histories explicitly related Daqin and Lijian (also \\"Li- kan\\", or Syria) as belonging to the same country; according to Yule, D. D. Leslie, and K. H. G. Gardiner, the earliest descriptions of Lijian in the Shiji distinguished it as the Hellenistic-era Seleucid Empire.Yule (1915), p. 41; footnote #4.For a review of The Roman Empire as Known to Han China: The Roman Empire in Chinese Sources by D. D. Leslie; K. H. J. Gardiner, see Pulleyblank (1999), pp 71-79; for the specific claim about \\"Li-Kan\\" or Lijian see Pulleyblank (1999), p 73. Pulleyblank provides some linguistic analysis to dispute their proposal, arguing that Tiaozhi () in the Shiji was most likely the Seleucid Empire and that Lijian, although still poorly understood, could be identified with either Hyrcania in Iran or even Alexandria in Egypt.Pulleyblank (1999), pp 73-77; Lijian's identification as Hyrcania was put forward by Marie-Félicité Brosset (1828) and accepted by Markwart, De Groot, and Herrmann (1941). Paul Pelliot advanced the theory that Lijian was a transliteration of Alexandria in Roman Egypt. The Weilüe by Yu Huan (c. 239–265 AD), preserved in annotations to the Records of the Three Kingdoms (published in 429 AD by Pei Songzhi), also provides details about the easternmost portion of the Roman world, including mention of the Mediterranean Sea. For Roman Egypt, the book explains the location of Alexandria, travelling distances along the Nile and the tripartite division of the Nile Delta, Heptanomis, and Thebaid. In his Zhu Fan Zhi, the Song-era Quanzhou customs inspector Zhao Rugua (1170–1228 AD) described the ancient Lighthouse of Alexandria.Needham (1971), p. 662. Both the Book of the Later Han and the Weilüe mention the \\"flying\\" pontoon bridge () over the Euphrates at Zeugma, Commagene in Roman Anatolia. The Weilüe also listed what it considered the most important dependent vassal states of the Roman Empire, providing travel directions and estimates for the distances between them (in Chinese miles, li). Friedrich Hirth (1885) identified the locations and dependent states of Rome named in the Weilüe; some of his identifications have been disputed.Hirth (2000) [1885], \\"From the Wei-lio (written before 429 C.E.), for 220–264 C.E.\\", (using Wade-Giles) identified these dependent vassal states as Alexandria- Euphrates or Charax Spasinu (\\"Ala-san\\"), Nikephorium (\\"Lu-fen\\"), Palmyra (\\"Ch'ieh-lan\\"), Damascus (\\"Hsien-tu\\"), Emesa (\\"Si-fu\\"), and Hira (\\"Ho-lat\\"). Going south of Palmyra and Emesa led one to the \\"Stony Land\\", which Hirth identified as Arabia Petraea, due to the text speaking how it bordered a sea (the Red Sea) where corals and real pearls were extracted. The text also explained the positions of border territories that were controlled by Parthia, such as Seleucia (\\"Si-lo\\"). Hill (September 2004), \\"Section 14 – Roman Dependencies\\", identified the dependent vassal states as Azania (), Al Wajh (), Wadi Sirhan (), Leukos Limên, ancient site controlling the entrance to the Gulf of Aqaba near modern Aynūnah (), Petra (), al-Karak (), and Sura (). Hirth identified Si-fu () as Emesa; John E. Hill (2004) uses linguistic and situational evidence to argue it was Petra in the Nabataean Kingdom, which was annexed by Rome in 106 AD during the reign of Trajan. The Old Book of Tang and New Book of Tang record that the Arabs (Da shi ) sent their commander Mo-yi (, pinyin: Móyè, i.e. Muawiyah I, governor of Syria and later Umayyad caliph, r. 661–680 AD) to besiege the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, and forced the Byzantines to pay them tribute. The same books also described Constantinople in some detail as having strong granite walls and a water clock mounted with a golden statue of man.Yule (1915), pp. 46–48.Ball (2016), pp. 152–153; see also endnote #114. Henry Yule noted that the name of the Byzantine negotiator \\"Yenyo\\" (the patrician John Pitzigaudes) was mentioned in Chinese sources, an envoy who was unnamed in Edward Gibbon's account of the man sent to Damascus to hold a parley with the Umayyads, followed a few years later by the increase of tributary demands on the Byzantines.Yule (1915), pp. 48–49; for a brief summary of Gibbon's account, see also footnote #1 on p. 49. The New Book of Tang and Wenxian Tongkao described the land of Nubia (either the Kingdom of Kush or Aksum) as a desert south-west of the Byzantine Empire that was infested with malaria, where the natives had black skin and consumed Persian dates. In discussing the three main religions of Nubia (the Sudan), the Wenxian Tongkao mentions the Daqin religion there and the day of rest occurring every seven days for those following the faith of the Da shi (the Muslim Arabs). It also repeats the claim in the New Book of Tang about the Eastern Roman surgical practice of trepanning to remove parasites from the brain. The descriptions of Nubia and Horn of Africa in the Wenxian Tongkao were ultimately derived from the Jingxingji of Du Huan (fl. 8th century AD),Bai (2003), pp 242-247. a Chinese travel writer whose text, preserved in the Tongdian of Du You, is perhaps the first Chinese source to describe Ethiopia (Laobosa), in addition to offering descriptions of Eritrea (Molin).

Xinjiang Region Museum. =Prelude= Some contact may have occurred between Hellenistic Greeks and the Qin dynasty in the late 3rd century BC, following the Central Asian campaigns of Alexander the Great, king of Macedon, and the establishment of Hellenistic kingdoms relatively close to China, such as the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom. Excavations at the burial site of China's first Emperor Qin Shi Huang (r. 221–210 BC) suggest ancient Greeks may have paid tribute and submitted to the supreme universal rule of the Han Chinese Qin dynasty emperor by giving him gifts with Greek stylistic and technological influences in some of the artworks found buried there, including a few examples of the famous terracotta army. Cultural exchanges at such an early date are generally regarded as conjectural in academia, but excavations of a 4th-century BC tomb in Gansu province belonging to the state of Qin have yielded Western items such as glass beads and a blue-glazed (possibly faience) beaker of Mediterranean origin.Sun (July 2009), p. 7. Trade and diplomatic relations between China's Han Empire and remnants of Hellenistic Greek civilization under the rule of the nomadic Da Yuezhi began with the Central Asian journeys of the Han envoy Zhang Qian (d. 113 BC). He brought back reports to the court of Emperor Wu of Han about the \\"Dayuan\\" in the Fergana Valley, with Alexandria Eschate as its capital, and the \\"Daxia\\" of Bactria, in what is now Afghanistan and Tajikistan.Yang, Juping. “Hellenistic Information in China.” CHS Research Bulletin 2, no. 2 (2014). http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:hlnc.essay:YangJ.Hellenistic_Information_in_China.2014.

He speculated that these people were more likely to have been private merchants than diplomats, since Chinese records insist that Gan Ying was the first Chinese to reach as far west as Tiaozhi (; Mesopotamia) in 97 AD.Yule (1915), p. 18; for a discussion of Tiaozhi (条支) and even its etymology possibly stemming from the Tajiks and Iranian peoples under ancient Chinese rule, see footnote #2 on p. 42. Yule notes that the 1st- century AD Periplus mentioned that people of Thinae (Sinae) were rarely seen, because of the difficulties of reaching that country.Yule (1915), footnote #2 on p. 43. It states that their country, located under Ursa Minor and on the farthest unknown reaches of the Caspian Sea, was the origin of raw silk and fine silk cloth that was traded overland from Bactria to Barygaza, as well as down the Ganges.Schoff (2004) [1912], Paragraph #64. Retrieved 19 September 2016. =Envoy Gan Ying= Ming-dynasty encyclopedia Sancai Tuhui, 1609 The Eastern Han general Ban Chao (32–102 AD), in a series of military successes which brought the Western Regions (the Tarim Basin of Xinjiang) back under Chinese control and suzerainty, defeated the Da Yuezhi in 90 AD and the Northern Xiongnu in 91 AD, forcing the submission of city-states such as Kucha and Turfan, Khotan and Kashgar (Indo-European Tocharian and Saka settlements, respectively),Tremblay (2007), p. 77. and finally Karasahr in 94 AD.Crespigny (2007), p. 590.Yule (1915), p. 40. An embassy from the Parthian Empire had earlier arrived at the Han court in 89 AD and, while Ban was stationed with his army in Khotan, another Parthian embassy came in 101 AD, this time bringing exotic gifts such as ostriches.Crespigny (2007), pp. 590–591. In 97 AD, Ban Chao sent an envoy named Gan Ying to explore the far west. Gan made his way from the Tarim Basin to Parthia and reached the Persian Gulf.Crespigny (2007), pp. 239–240. Gan left a detailed account of western countries; he apparently reached as far as Mesopotamia, then under the control of the Parthian Empire. He intended to sail to the Roman Empire, but was discouraged when told that the trip was dangerous and could take two years.Hill (2009), p. 5.Pulleyblank (1999), pp. 77–78. Deterred, he returned to China bringing much new information on the countries to the west of Chinese-controlled territories,Hill (2009), pp. 5, 481–483. as far as the Mediterranean Basin. Gan Ying is thought to have left an account of the Roman Empire (Daqin in Chinese) which relied on secondary sources—likely sailors in the ports which he visited. The Book of the Later Han locates it in Haixi (\\"west of the sea\\", or Roman Egypt; the sea is the one known to the Greeks and Romans as the Erythraean Sea, which included the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Sea, and Red Sea):Hill (2009), pp. 23, 25. The Book of the Later Han gives a positive, if inaccurate, view of Roman governance: Yule noted that although the description of the Roman Constitution and products was garbled, the Book of the Later Han offered an accurate depiction of the coral fisheries in the Mediterranean.Yule (1915), pp. 43–44. Coral was a highly valued luxury item in Han China, imported among other items from India (mostly overland and perhaps also by sea), the latter region being where the Romans sold coral and obtained pearls.Kumar (2005), pp. 61–62. The original list of Roman products given in the Book of the Later Han, such as sea silk, glass, amber, cinnabar, and asbestos cloth, is expanded in the Weilüe.Hill (2009), p. 25. The Weilüe also claimed that in 134 AD the ruler of the Shule Kingdom (Kashgar), who had been a hostage at the court of the Kushan Empire, offered blue (or green) gems originating from Haixi as gifts to the Eastern Han court. Fan Ye, the editor of the Book of the Later Han, wrote that former generations of Chinese had never reached these far western regions, but that the report of Gan Ying revealed to the Chinese their lands, customs and products.Hill, John E. (2012) Through the Jade Gate: China to Rome 2nd edition, p. 55. In press. The Book of the Later Han also asserts that the Parthians (Chinese: 安息; Anxi) wished \\"to control the trade in multi-coloured Chinese silks\\" and therefore intentionally blocked the Romans from reaching China. =Possible Roman Greeks in Burma and China= Western Han ceramic vessels showing acrobats balancing by hand on their rims; the Shiji and Book of Han state that Mithridates II of the Parthian Empire sent gifts including Syrian jugglers to the court of Emperor Wu of Han; the Book of the Later Han states that a king of Burma sent acrobats originally from Daqin to the court of Emperor An of Han in 120 AD. It is possible that a group of Greek acrobatic performers, who claimed to be from a place \\"west of the seas\\" (Roman Egypt, which the Book of the Later Han related to the Daqin empire), were presented by a king of Burma to Emperor An of Han in 120 AD. \\"永寧元年，撣國王雍由調復遣使者詣闕朝賀，獻樂及幻人，能變化吐火，自支解，易牛馬頭。又善跳丸， 數乃至千。自言我海西人。海西即大秦也，撣國西南通大秦。明年元會，安帝作樂於庭，封雍由調爲漢大都尉，賜印綬､金銀､綵繒各有差也。\\" A translation of this passage into English, in addition to an explanation of how Greek athletic performers figured prominently in the neighbouring Parthian and Kushan Empires of Asia, is offered by Christopoulos (August 2012), pp. 40–41: > The first year of Yongning (120 AD), the southwestern barbarian king of the > kingdom of Chan (Burma), Yongyou, proposed illusionists (jugglers) who could > metamorphose themselves and spit out fire; they could dismember themselves > and change an ox head into a horse head. They were very skilful in > acrobatics and they could do a thousand other things. They said that they > were from the \\"west of the seas\\" (Haixi–Egypt). The west of the seas is the > Daqin (Rome).

They > received the honours of the Emperor, with gold and silver, and every one of > them received a different gift. McLaughlin (2014), pp. 204–205.Yule (1915), pp. 52–53. It is known that in both the Parthian Empire and Kushan Empire of Asia, ethnic Greeks continued to be employed after the Hellenistic period as musicians and athletes.Christopoulos (August 2012), pp. 40–41.Cumont (1933), pp. 264–68. The Book of the Later Han states that Emperor An transferred these entertainers from his countryside residence to the capital Luoyang, where they gave a performance at his court and were rewarded with gold, silver, and other gifts.Christopoulos (August 2012), p. 41. With regard to the origin of these entertainers, Raoul McLaughlin speculates that the Romans were selling slaves to the Burmese and that this is how the entertainers originally reached Burma before they were sent by the Burmese ruler to Emperor An in China.McLaughlin (2010), p. 58.Raoul McLaughlin notes that the Romans knew Burma as India Trans Gangem (India Beyond the Ganges) and that Ptolemy listed the cities of Burma. See Meanwhile, Syrian jugglers were renowned in Western Classical literature,Braun (2002), p. 260. and Chinese sources from the 2nd century BC to the 2nd century AD seem to mention them as well. =First Roman embassy= A mural showing women dressed in traditional Hanfu silk robes, from the Dahuting Tomb (Chinese: , pinyin: Dahuting Han mu) of the late Eastern Han dynasty (25–220 AD), located in Zhengzhou, Henan province, China The first group of people claiming to be an ambassadorial mission of Romans to China was recorded as having arrived in 166 AD by the Book of the Later Han. The embassy came to Emperor Huan of Han China from \\"Andun\\" (; Emperor Antoninus Pius or Marcus Aurelius Antoninus), \\"king of Daqin\\" (Rome).Yü (1986), pp. 460–461. As Antoninus Pius died in 161 AD, leaving the empire to his adoptive son Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, and the envoy arrived in 166 AD, confusion remains about who sent the mission, as both emperors were named \\"Antoninus\\".Pulleyblank (1999), p. 78.Hill (2009), p. 27. The Roman mission came from the south (therefore probably by sea), entering China by the frontier of Rinan or Tonkin (present-day Vietnam). It brought presents of rhinoceros horns, ivory, and tortoise shell, probably acquired in Southern Asia.Hill (2009), p. 27 and nn. 12.18 and 12.20. The text states that it was the first time there had been direct contact between the two countries. Yule speculated that the Roman visitors must have lost their original wares due to robbery or shipwreck and used the gifts instead, prompting Chinese sources to suspect them of withholding their more precious valuables, which Yule notes was the same criticism directed at papal missionary John of Montecorvino when he arrived in China in the late 13th century AD.Yule (1915), pp. 51–52. Historians Rafe de Crespigny, Peter Fibiger Bang, and Warwick Ball believe that this was most likely a group of Roman merchants rather than official diplomats sent by Marcus Aurelius.Ball (2016), p. 152.de Crespigny (2007), p. 600.Bang (2009), p. 120. Crespigny stresses that the presence of this Roman embassy as well as others from Tianzhu (in northern India) and Buyeo (in Manchuria) provided much-needed prestige for Emperor Huan, as he was facing serious political troubles and fallout for the forced suicide of politician Liang Ji, who had dominated the Han government well after the death of his sister Empress Liang Na.de Crespigny. (2007), pp. 597–600. Yule emphasised that the Roman embassy was said to come by way of Jiaozhi in northern Vietnam, the same route that Chinese sources claimed the embassies from Tianzhu (northern India) had used in 159 and 161 AD.Yule (1915), p. 52. =Other Roman embassies= Green Roman glass cup unearthed from an Eastern Han dynasty (25–220 AD) tomb of Guangxi (bordering modern-day Vietnam in southern China) Eastern Roman embassy to Emperor Taizong of Tang in 643 AD The Weilüe and Book of Liang record the arrival in 226 AD of a merchant named Qin Lun () from the Roman Empire (Daqin) at Jiaozhi (Chinese-controlled northern Vietnam). Wu Miao, the Prefect of Jiaozhi, sent him to the court of Sun Quan (the ruler of Eastern Wu during the Three Kingdoms) in Nanjing, where Sun requested that he provide him with a report on his native country and its people. An expedition was mounted to return the merchant along with ten female and ten male \\"blackish coloured dwarfs\\" he had requested as a curiosity, as well as a Chinese officer, Liu Xian of Huiji (in Zhejiang), who died en route.Hirth (1885), pp. 47–48. According to the Weilüe and Book of Liang Roman merchants were active in Cambodia and Vietnam, a claim supported by modern archaeological finds of ancient Mediterranean goods in the Southeast Asian countries of Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Yule mentions that in the early 3rd century AD a ruler of Daqin sent an envoy with gifts to the northern Chinese court of Cao Wei (220–266 AD) that included glassware of various colours. Several years later a Daqin craftsman is mentioned as showing the Chinese how to make \\"flints into crystal by means of fire\\", a curiosity to the Chinese.Yule (1915), p. 53; see footnotes #4–5. Another embassy from Daqin is recorded as bringing tributary gifts to the Chinese Jin Empire (266–420 AD). This occurred in 284 AD during the reign of Emperor Wu of Jin (r. 266–290 AD), and was recorded in the Book of Jin, as well as the later Wenxian Tongkao. This embassy was presumably sent by the Emperor Carus (r. 282–283 AD), whose brief reign was preoccupied by war with Sasanian Persia.Yule (1915), pp. 53–54. =Fulin: Eastern Roman embassies= Emperor Taizong of Tang (r. 626–649 AD) receives Gar Tongtsen Yülsung, ambassador of the Tibetan Empire, at his court. Later copy of a 641 painting by the Tang court artist Yan Liben (600–673 AD). Chinese histories for the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD) record contacts with merchants from \\"Fulin\\" (), the new name used to designate the Byzantine Empire.Wilkinson (2000), p. 730, footnote #14.Yule (1915), pp. 55–57. The first reported diplomatic contact took place in 643 AD during the reigns of Constans II (641–668 AD) and Emperor Taizong of Tang (626–649 AD). The Old Book of Tang, followed by the New Book of Tang, provides the name \\"Po-to-li\\" (, pinyin: Bōduōlì) for Constans II, which Hirth conjectured to be a transliteration of Kōnstantinos Pogonatos, or \\"Constantine the Bearded\\", giving him the title of a king (王 wáng). YuleYule (1915), footnote #2 of pp. 54–55. and S. A. M. Adshead offer a different transliteration stemming from \\"patriarch\\" or \\"patrician\\", possibly a reference to one of the acting regents for the 13-year-old Byzantine monarch.Adshead (1995) [1988], p. 105. The Tang histories record that Constans II sent an embassy in the 17th year of the Zhenguan () regnal period (643 AD), bearing gifts of red glass and green gemstones. Yule points out that Yazdegerd III (r. 632–651 AD), last ruler of the Sasanian Empire, sent diplomats to China to secure aid from Emperor Taizong (considered the suzerain over Ferghana in Central Asia) during the loss of the Persian heartland to the Islamic Rashidun Caliphate, which may also have prompted the Byzantines to send envoys to China amid their recent loss of Syria to the Muslims.Yule (1915), pp. 54–55. Tang Chinese sources also recorded how Sasanian prince Peroz III (636–679 AD) fled to Tang China following the conquest of Persia by the growing Islamic caliphate.Schafer (1985), pp. 10, 25–26. Yule asserts that the additional Fulin embassies during the Tang period arrived in 711 and 719 AD, with another in 742 AD that may have been Nestorian monks.Yule (1915), pp. 55–56. Adshead lists four official diplomatic contacts with Fulin in the Old Book of Tang as occurring in 643, 667, 701, and 719 AD.Adshead (1995) [1988], pp. 104–106. He speculates that the absence of these missions in Western literary sources can be explained by how the Byzantines typically viewed political relations with powers of the East, as well as the possibility that they were launched on behalf of frontier officials instead of the central government.Adshead (1995) [1988], p. 104. Yule and Adshead concur that a Fulin diplomatic mission occurred during the reign of Justinian II (r. 685–695 AD; 705–711 AD). Yule claims it occurred in the year of the emperor's death, 711 AD,Yule (1915), p. 55. whereas Adshead contends that it took place in 701 AD during the usurpation of Leontios and the emperor's exile in Crimea, perhaps the reason for its omission in Byzantine records and the source for confusion in Chinese histories about precisely who sent this embassy.Adshead (1995), pp. 105–106. Justinian II regained the throne with the aid of Bulgars and a marriage alliance with the Khazars. Adshead therefore believes a mission sent to Tang China would be consistent with Justinian II's behaviour, especially if he had knowledge of the permission Empress Wu Zetian granted to Narsieh, son of Peroz III, to march against the Arabs in Central Asia at the end of the 7th century. The 719 AD Fulin embassy ostensibly came from Leo III the Isaurian (r. 717–741 AD) to the court of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang (r. 712–756 AD), during a time when the Byzantine emperor was again reaching out to Eastern powers with a renewed Khazar marriage alliance.Adshead (1995) [1988], p. 106. The year of this embassy coincided with Xuanzong's refusal to provide aid to the Sogdians of Bukhara and Samarkand against the Arab invasion force. An embassy from the Umayyad Caliphate was received by the Tang court in 732 AD; the Arab victory at the 751 AD Battle of Talas and the An Lushan Rebellion crippled Tang Chinese interventionist efforts in Central Asia.Adshead (1995) [1988], pp. 106–107. The last diplomatic contacts with Fulin are recorded as having taken place in the 11th century AD. From the Wenxian Tongkao, written by historian Ma Duanlin (1245–1322), and from the History of Song, it is known that the Byzantine emperor Michael VII Parapinakēs Caesar (, Mie li sha ling kai sa) of Fulin sent an embassy to China's Song dynasty that arrived in 1081 AD, during the reign of Emperor Shenzong of Song (r. 1067–1085 AD).Sezgin (1996), p. 25. The History of Song described the tributary gifts given by the Byzantine embassy as well as the products made in Byzantium. It also described punishments used in Byzantine law, such as the capital punishment of being stuffed into a \\"feather bag\\" and thrown into the sea, probably the Romano- Byzantine practice of poena cullei (from Latin 'penalty of the sack').Bauman (2005), p. 23. The final recorded embassy arrived in 1091 AD, during the reign of Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081–1118 AD); this event is only mentioned in passing.Yule (1915), pp. 56–57. The History of Yuan offers a biography of a Byzantine man named Ai-sie (transliteration of either Joshua or Joseph), who originally served the court of Güyük Khan but later became a head astronomer and physician for the court of Kublai Khan, the Mongol founder of the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368 AD), at Khanbaliq (modern Beijing).Bretschneider (1888), p. 144. He was eventually granted the title Prince of Fulin (, Fúlǐn wáng) and his children were listed with their Chinese names, which seem to match with transliterations of the Christian names Elias, Luke, and Antony. Kublai Khan is also known to have sent Nestorian monks, including Rabban Bar Sauma, to the court of Byzantine ruler Andronikos II Palaiologos (r. 1282–1328 AD), whose half-sisters were married to the great-grandsons of Genghis Khan, making this Byzantine ruler an in-law with the Mongol ruler in Beijing.Luttwak (2009), p. 169. Within the Mongol Empire, which eventually included all of China, there were enough Westerners travelling there that in 1340 AD Francesco Balducci Pegolotti compiled a guide book for fellow merchants on how to exchange silver for paper money to purchase silk in Khanbaliq (Beijing).Spielvogel (2011), p. 183. By this stage the Eastern Roman Empire, temporarily dismantled by the Latin Empire, had shrunk to the size of a rump state in parts of Greece and Anatolia.Jacobi (1999), pp. 525–542.Reinert (2002), pp. 257–261. Ma Duanlin, author of the Wenxian Tongkao, noted the shifting political boundaries, albeit based on generally inaccurate and distorted political geography. He wrote that historians of the Tang Dynasty considered \\"Daqin\\" and \\"Fulin\\" to be the same country, but he had his reservations about this due to discrepancies in geographical accounts and other concerns (Wade–Giles spelling): The History of Ming expounds how the Hongwu Emperor, founder of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644 AD), sent a merchant of Fulin named \\"Nieh-ku-lun\\" () back to his native country with a letter announcing the founding of the Ming dynasty.Grant (2005), p. 99.Hirth (1885), p. 66. It is speculated that the merchant was a former archbishop of Khanbaliq called Nicolaus de Bentra (who succeeded John of Montecorvino for that position).Luttwak (2009), p. 170. The History of Ming goes on to explain that contacts between China and Fulin ceased after this point and an envoy of the great western sea (the Mediterranean Sea) did not appear in China again until the 16th century AD, with the 1582 AD arrival of the Italian Jesuit missionary Matteo Ricci in Portuguese Macau.For information on Matteo Ricci and reestablishment of Western contact with China by the Portuguese Empire during the Age of Discovery, see: Fontana (2011), pp. 18–35, 116–118. Trade relationsRoman exports to China= Roman glass from the 2nd century AD Roman fresco from Pompeii showing a Maenad in silk dress, Naples National Archaeological Museum A painting entitled Separated by a Green Curtain, a Chinese and Roman Artist Compete with Each Other, original by Nizami Ganjavi (1141–1209), from a Persian Timurid-era copy dated 1481 Direct trade links between the Mediterranean lands and India had been established in the late 2nd century BC by the Hellenistic Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt.McLaughlin (2010), p. 25. Greek navigators learned to use the regular pattern of the monsoon winds for their trade voyages in the Indian Ocean. The lively sea trade in Roman times is confirmed by the excavation of large deposits of Roman coins along much of the coast of India. Many trading ports with links to Roman communities have been identified in India and Sri Lanka along the route used by the Roman mission.McLaughlin (2010), pp. 34–57. Archaeological evidence stretching from the Red Sea ports of Roman Egypt to India suggests that Roman commercial activity in the Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia declined heavily with the Antonine Plague of 166 AD, the same year as the first Roman embassy to Han China, where similar plague outbreaks had occurred from 151 AD.de Crespigny. (2007), pp. 514, 600.McLaughlin (2010), p. 58–60. High-quality glass from Roman manufacturers in Alexandria and Syria was exported to many parts of Asia, including Han China.An (2002), p. 82. The first Roman glassware discovered in China is a blue soda-lime glass bowl dating to the early 1st century BC and excavated from a Western Han tomb in the southern port city of Guangzhou, which may have come there via the Indian Ocean and South China Sea.An (2002), p. 83. Other Roman glass items include a mosaic-glass bowl found in a prince's tomb near Nanjing dated to 67 AD and a glass bottle with opaque white streaks found in an Eastern Han tomb of Luoyang.An (2002), pp. 83–84. Roman and Persian glassware has been found in a 5th-century AD tomb of Gyeongju, Korea, capital of ancient Silla, east of China. Roman glass beads have been discovered as far as Japan, within the 5th- century AD Kofun-era Utsukushi burial mound near Kyoto. From Chinese sources it is known that other Roman luxury items were esteemed by the Chinese. These include gold-embroidered rugs and gold-coloured cloth, amber, asbestos cloth, and sea silk, which was a cloth made from the silk-like hairs of a Mediterranean shell-fish, the Pinna nobilis.Thorley (1971), pp. 71–80.Hill (2009), Appendix B – Sea Silk, pp. 466–476.Lewis (2007), p. 115. As well as silver and bronze items found throughout China dated to the 3rd–2nd centuries BC and perhaps originating from the Seleucid Empire, there is also a Roman gilded silver plate dated to the 2nd–3rd centuries AD and found in Jingyuan County, Gansu, with a raised relief image in the centre depicting the Greco- Roman god Dionysus resting on a feline creature.Harper (2002), pp. 99–100, 106–107. A maritime route opened up with the Chinese-controlled port of Rinan in Jiaozhi (centred in modern Vietnam) and the Khmer kingdom of Funan by the 2nd century AD, if not earlier.Hill (2009), p. 291. Jiaozhi was proposed by Ferdinand von Richthofen in 1877 to have been the port known to the Greco- Roman geographer Ptolemy as Cattigara, situated near modern Hanoi.Ferdinand von Richthofen, China, Berlin, 1877, Vol.I, pp. 504–510; cited in Richard Hennig,Terrae incognitae : eine Zusammenstellung und kritische Bewertung der wichtigsten vorcolumbischen Entdeckungsreisen an Hand der daruber vorliegenden Originalberichte, Band I, Altertum bis Ptolemäus, Leiden, Brill, 1944, pp. 387, 410–411; cited in Zürcher (2002), pp. 30–31. Ptolemy wrote that Cattigara lay beyond the Golden Chersonese (the Malay Peninsula) and was visited by a Greek sailor named Alexander, most likely a merchant. Richthofen's identification of Cattigara as Hanoi was widely accepted until archaeological discoveries at Óc Eo (near Ho Chi Minh City) in the Mekong Delta during the mid-20th century suggested this may have been its location.For a summary of scholarly debate about the possible locations of Cattigara by the end of the 20th century, with proposals ranging from Guangzhou, Hanoi, and the Mekong River Delta of the Kingdom of Funan, see: Suárez (1999), p. 92. At this place, which was once located along the coastline, Roman coins were among the vestiges of long-distance trade discovered by the French archaeologist Louis Malleret in the 1940s.Osborne (2006), pp. 24–25. These include Roman golden medallions from the reigns of Antoninus Pius and his successor Marcus Aurelius.Young (2001), p. 29. Furthermore, Roman goods and native jewellery imitating Antonine Roman coins have been found there, and Granville Allen Mawer states that Ptolemy's Cattigara seems to correspond with the latitude of modern Óc Eo.Mawer (2013), p. 38.Mawer also mentions Kauthara (in Khánh Hòa Province, Vietnam) and Kutaradja (Banda Aceh, Indonesia) as other plausible sites for that port. Mawer (2013), p. 38. In addition, Ancient Roman glass beads and bracelets were also found at the site. The trade connection from Cattigara extended, via ports on the coasts of India and Sri Lanka, all the way to Roman-controlled ports in Egypt and the Nabataean territories on the north-eastern coast of the Red Sea.Young (2001), pp. 29–30. The archaeologist Warwick Ball does not consider discoveries such as the Roman and Roman- inspired goods at Óc Eo, a coin of Roman emperor Maximian found in Tonkin, and a Roman bronze lamp at P'ong Tuk in the Mekong Delta, to be conclusive proof that Romans visited these areas and suggests that the items could have been introduced by Indian merchants.Ball (2016), p. 153. While observing that the Romans had a recognised trading port in Southeast Asia, Dougald O'Reilly writes that there is little evidence to suggest Cattigara was Óc Eo. He argues that the Roman items found there only indicate that the Indian Ocean trade network extended to the ancient Kingdom of Funan. =Chinese silk in the Roman Empire= Chinese trade with the Roman Empire, confirmed by the Roman desire for silk, started in the 1st century BC. The Romans knew of wild silk harvested on Cos (coa vestis), but they did not at first make the connection with the silk that was produced in the Pamir Sarikol kingdom.Schoff (1915), p. 229. There were few direct trade contacts between Romans and Han Chinese, as the rival Parthians and Kushans were each protecting their lucrative role as trade intermediaries.Thorley (1979), pp. 181–190 (187f.).Thorley (1971), pp. 71–80 (76). During the 1st century BC silk was still a rare commodity in the Roman world; by the 1st century AD this valuable trade item became much more widely available.Whitfield (1999), p. 21. In his Natural History (77–79 AD), Pliny the Elder lamented the financial drain of coin from the Roman economy to purchase this expensive luxury. He remarked that Rome's \\"womankind\\" and the purchase of luxury goods from India, Arabia, and the Seres of the Far East cost the empire roughly 100 million sesterces per year,\\"India, China and the Arabian peninsula take one hundred million sesterces from our empire per annum at a conservative estimate: that is what our luxuries and women cost us. For what fraction of these imports is intended for sacrifices to the gods or the spirits of the dead?\\" Original Latin: \\"minimaque computatione miliens centena milia sestertium annis omnibus India et Seres et paeninsula illa imperio nostro adimunt: tanti nobis deliciae et feminae constant. quota enim portio ex illis ad deos, quaeso, iam vel ad inferos pertinet?\\" Pliny, Historia Naturae 12.41.84. and claimed that journeys were made to the Seres to acquire silk cloth along with pearl diving in the Red Sea.Natural History (Pliny), as quoted in Whitfield (1999), p. 21. Despite the claims by Pliny the Elder about the trade imbalance and quantity of Rome's coinage used to purchase silk, Warwick Ball asserts that the Roman purchase of other foreign commodities, particularly spices from India, had a much greater impact on the Roman economy. In 14 AD the Senate issued an edict prohibiting the wearing of silk by men, but it continued to flow unabated into the Roman world. Beyond the economic concerns that the import of silk caused a huge outflow of wealth, silk clothes were also considered to be decadent and immoral by Seneca the Elder: Roman glass, dated 52–125 AD and found at Begram, Afghanistan, a royal city of the Kushan Empire where, according to Warwick Ball, it was likely on its way to China via the Silk Road along with other glass items. A late Eastern Han (25–220 AD) Chinese tomb mural showing a banquet with men and women wearing traditional Hanfu silk robes, from the Dahuting Tomb (Chinese: 打虎亭汉墓) on the southern bank of the Suihe River in Zhengzhou, China Trade items such as spice and silk had to be paid for with Roman gold coinage. There was some demand in China for Roman glass; the Han Chinese also produced glass in certain locations.Ball (2016), pp. 153–154. Chinese-produced glassware date back to the Western Han era (202 BC – 9 AD).An (2002), pp. 82–83. In dealing with foreign states such as the Parthian Empire, the Han Chinese were perhaps more concerned with diplomatically outmaneuvering their chief enemies, the nomadic Xiongnu, than with establishing trade, since mercantile pursuits and the merchant class were frowned upon by the gentry who dominated the Han government.Ball (2016), p. 155. =Roman and Byzantine currency discovered in China= Bronze coin of Constantius II (337–361 AD), found in Karghalik, modern China Valerie Hansen wrote in 2012 that no Roman coins from the Roman Republic (509–27 BC) or the Principate (27 BC – 284 AD) era of the Roman Empire have been found in China.Hansen (2012), p. 97. Nevertheless, Warwick Ball (2016) cites two studies from 1978 summarizing the discovery at Xi'an, China (the site of the Han capital Chang'an) of a hoard of sixteen Roman coins from the reigns of Tiberius (14–37 AD) to Aurelian (270–275 AD).Ball (2016), p. 154. The Roman coins found at Óc Eo, Vietnam, near Chinese-controlled Jiaozhou, date to the mid-2nd century AD.O'Reilly (2007), p. 97. A coin of Maximian (r. 286–305 AD) was also discovered in Tonkin. As a note, Roman coins of the 3rd and 4th centuries AD have been discovered in Japan; they were unearthed from Katsuren Castle (in Uruma, Okinawa), which was built from the 12th to 15th centuries AD. Shortly after the smuggling of silkworm eggs into the Byzantine Empire from China by Nestorian Christian monks, the 6th-century AD Byzantine historian Menander Protector wrote of how the Sogdians attempted to establish a direct trade of Chinese silk with the Byzantine Empire. After forming an alliance with the Sasanian Persian ruler Khosrow I to defeat the Hephthalite Empire, Istämi, the Göktürk ruler of the First Turkic Khaganate, was approached by Sogdian merchants requesting permission to seek an audience with the Sasanian king of kings for the privilege of travelling through Persian territories to trade with the Byzantines.Howard (2012), p. 133. Istämi refused the first request, but when he sanctioned the second one and had the Sogdian embassy sent to the Sasanian king, the latter had the members of the embassy killed by poison. Maniakh, a Sogdian diplomat, convinced Istämi to send an embassy directly to Byzantium's capital Constantinople, which arrived in 568 AD and offered not only silk as a gift to Byzantine ruler Justin II, but also an alliance against Sasanian Persia. Justin II agreed and sent an embassy under Zemarchus to the Turkic Khaganate, ensuring the direct silk trade desired by the Sogdians.Liu (2001), p. 168.Dresden (1981), p. 9. The small number of Roman and Byzantine coins found during excavations of Central Asian and Chinese archaeological sites from this era suggests that direct trade with the Sogdians remained limited. This was despite the fact that ancient Romans imported Han Chinese silk,Brosius (2006), pp. 122–123. and discoveries in contemporary tombs indicate that the Han-dynasty Chinese imported Roman glassware.An (2002), pp. 79–94. The earliest gold solidus coins from the Eastern Roman Empire found in China date to the reign of Byzantine emperor Theodosius II (r. 408–450 AD) and altogether only forty-eight of them have been found (compared to 1300 silver coins) in Xinjiang and the rest of China. The use of silver coins in Turfan persisted long after the Tang campaign against Karakhoja and Chinese conquest of 640 AD, with a gradual adoption of Chinese bronze coinage during the 7th century AD. Hansen maintains that these Eastern Roman coins were almost always found with Sasanian Persian silver coins and Eastern Roman gold coins were used more as ceremonial objects like talismans, confirming the pre-eminence of Greater Iran in Chinese Silk Road commerce of Central Asia compared to Eastern Rome.Hansen (2012), pp. 97–98. Walter Scheidel remarks that the Chinese viewed Byzantine coins as pieces of exotic jewellery, preferring to use bronze coinage in the Tang and Song dynasties, as well as paper money during the Song and Ming periods, even while silver bullion was plentiful.Scheidel (2009), p. 186. Ball writes that the scarcity of Roman and Byzantine coins in China, and the greater amounts found in India, suggest that most Chinese silk purchased by the Romans was from maritime India, largely bypassing the overland Silk Road trade through Iran. Chinese coins from the Sui and Tang dynasties (6th–10th centuries AD) have been discovered in India; significantly larger amounts are dated to the Song period (11th–13th centuries AD), particularly in the territories of the contemporary Chola dynasty.Bagchi (2011), pp. 137–144. Even with the Byzantine production of silk starting in the 6th century AD, Chinese varieties were still considered to be of higher quality. This theory is supported by the discovery of a Byzantine solidus minted during the reign of Justin II found in a Sui-dynasty tomb of Shanxi province in 1953, among other Byzantine coins found at various sites.Luttwak (2009), pp. 168–169. Chinese histories offer descriptions of Roman and Byzantine coins. The Weilüe, Book of the Later Han, Book of Jin, as well as the later Wenxian Tongkao noted how ten ancient Roman silver coins were worth one Roman gold coin.Scheidel (2009), footnote #239 on p. 186. The Roman golden aureus was worth about twenty-five silver denarii.Corbier (2005), p. 333. During the later Byzantine Empire, twelve silver miliaresion was equal to one gold nomisma.Yule (1915), footnote #1 on p. 44. The History of Song notes that the Byzantines made coins of either silver or gold, without holes in the middle, with an inscription of the king's name. It also asserts that the Byzantines forbade the production of counterfeit coins. Human remains In 2010, mitochondrial DNA was used to identify that a partial skeleton found in a Roman grave from the 1st or 2nd century AD in Vagnari, Italy, had East Asian ancestry on his mother's side. A 2016 analysis of archaeological finds from Southwark in London, the site of the ancient Roman city Londinium in Roman Britain, suggests that two or three skeletons from a sample of twenty-two dating to the 2nd to the 4th centuries AD are of Asian ancestry, and possibly of Chinese descent. The assertion is based on forensics and the analysis of skeletal facial features. The discovery has been presented by Dr Rebecca Redfern, curator of human osteology at the Museum of London. No DNA analysis has yet been done, the skull and tooth samples available offer only fragmentary pieces of evidence, and the samples that were used were compared with the morphology of modern populations, not ancient ones.Kristina Killgrove. (23 September 2016). \\"Chinese Skeletons In Roman Britain? Not So Fast\\". Forbes. Accessed 25 September 2016.  Hypothetical military contact  The Roman prisoners of the Battle of Carrhae were brought to Margiana by king Orodes. Their further fate is unknown. The historian Homer H. Dubs speculated in 1941 that Roman prisoners of war who were transferred to the eastern border of the Parthian empire might later have clashed with Han troops there.Dubs (1941), pp. 322–330. After a Roman army under the command of Marcus Licinius Crassus decisively lost the battle of Carrhae in 54 BC, an estimated 10,000 Roman prisoners were dispatched by the Parthians to Margiana to man the frontier. Some time later the nomadic Xiongnu chief Zhizhi established a state further east in the Talas valley, near modern-day Taraz. Dubs points to a Chinese account by Ban Gu of about \\"a hundred men\\" under the command of Zhizhi who fought in a so-called \\"fish-scale formation\\" to defend Zhizhi's wooden-palisade fortress against Han forces, in the Battle of Zhizhi in 36 BC. He claimed that this might have been the Roman testudo formation and that these men, who were captured by the Chinese, founded the village of Liqian (Li-chien, possibly from \\"legio\\") in Yongchang County. There have been attempts to promote the Sino-Roman connection for tourism, but Dubs' synthesis of Roman and Chinese sources has not found acceptance among historians, on the grounds that it is highly speculative and reaches too many conclusions without sufficient hard evidence. DNA testing in 2005 confirmed the Indo-European ancestry of a few inhabitants of modern Liqian; this could be explained by transethnic marriages with Indo-European people known to have lived in Gansu in ancient times, such as the Yuezhi and Wusun. A much more comprehensive DNA analysis of more than two hundred male residents of the village in 2007 showed close genetic relation to the Han Chinese populace and great deviation from the Western Eurasian gene pool. The researchers conclude that the people of Liqian are probably of Han Chinese origin. The area lacks archaeological evidence of a Roman presence.

The regiment consists of primarily the Kirati Tribes Rai and Limbu of Nepal and north-eastern India. It also recruits from Indian Gorkhas and Bhutias from Darjeeling district, West Bengal and Sikkim. Though it is considered to be the youngest of the Gorkha regiments its lineage is as long as those of the 7th Gurkha Rifles and 10th Gurkha Rifles. The regiment has participated in all major military operations India has undertaken since independence including in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947, Operation Polo in 1948, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, and the Kargil War in 1999. Units of the regiment have also deployed abroad on UN missions. HistoryFirst raising= The 11th Gurkha Rifles was raised as an ad hoc unit in 1918 with troops and officers being drawn from the various Gurkha regiments. The regiment saw service in both Palestine and Mesopotamia at the end of the First World War, as well as during the Third Afghan War in 1919, before being disbanded in 1922 and the troops being reverted to their original units. There were no separate insignias authorized for this regiment and the personnel wore the badges of distinction of their parent units, though there have been instances where unofficial badges were made and worn by some personnel. =Second raising= Following Indian independence in 1947, the Gurkha regiments of the British Indian Army were divided between the new Indian Army and the British Army. A referendum was held among the soldiers of the four regiments (2nd, 6th, 7th and 10th Gurkhas) that would transfer to the British as to whether they wished to join the British Army, as the decision to do so was made entirely voluntary. Of the four regiments, one battalion (4th battalion, 2nd Gurkhas) opted en masse to join the Indian Army and became part of the 8 Gorkha Rifles as their 5th battalion. In the event, large numbers of men from the 7th and 10th Gurkhas, which recruited predominantly from eastern Nepal, opted to join the Indian Army as against the British Army to whom their regiments were allotted. So, in order to retain a contingent from this area of Nepal, the Indian Army made the decision to re-raise the 11 Gorkha Rifles. 11 Gorkha Rifles was officially re- raised on 1 January 1948, with the regimental centres at Palampur and Santa Cruz, Mumbai. The regimental centre was subsequently shifted to Jalapahar in Darjeeling, and then moved to Clement Town, Dehradun for a brief period, and finally to Lucknow where it was firmly established. The regiment was raised predominantly with the manpower from the non-optees of the 7th and 10th Gurkha Rifles. As the regiment was raised by the Indian Army after independence, it was decided not to retain the honours and traditions of the first 11th Gurkha Rifles of the British Indian Army. Today, the regiment has a total of six regular and one Territorial Army battalions. =Indo-Pakistani War of 1971= During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, the 5th battalion was involved in the action to fight against West Pakistan in East Pakistan(now Bangladesh), fetching the unit battle honour Bogra and theater honour East Pakistan. In the operations in East Pakistan, the unit had secured the Bogra town as part of 20 Mountain Division. In a daring operation, Lt. Teja Bedi single-handedly captured the headquarters along with the commanding officer and regimental medical officer of the Pakistan Army's 52nd battalion, Baloch Regiment, the regimental flag of which is still displayed upside down in the officers' mess of the unit as a prized possession. =Kargil War= During the Kargil War in 1999, the 1st battalion saw extensive action. Commanded by Col. Lalit Rai, it was tasked with the capture of several strategic peaks in the Kargil region. One of its units was led by Capt. Manoj Pandey, who posthumously received the Param Vir Chakra (PVC), India's highest gallantry award, for his actions in Batalik sector.

Founded in 1908 by faculty from the Omaha Presbyterian Theological Seminary as a private non-sectarian college, the university was originally known as the University of Omaha. Originally meant to provide a Christian-based education free from ecclesiastical control, the university served as a strong alternative to the city's many successful religiously affiliated institutions. Since the year 2000, the university has more than tripled its student housing and opened a 450-bed student dormitory and academic space on its south campus in 2017. It has also recently constructed modern facilities for its engineering, information technology, business, and biomechanics programs. UNO currently offers more than 200 programs of study across 6 different colleges and has over 60 classroom, student, athletic, and research facilities spread across 3 campuses. It is classified among \\"R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity\\". The Omaha Mavericks compete in 15 NCAA Division I sports in both the NCHC and Summit League conferences. The ice hockey, basketball, and volleyball teams compete in the new Baxter Arena located on the university's Center street campus. Softball and baseball facilities are currently under construction. UNO enjoyed national attention in 2015, when its men's hockey team reached the national semifinal (Frozen Four) of the NCAA tournament for the first time. HistoryOrigin= The original Omaha University was founded in 1908 in the Kountze Place neighborhood of North Omaha. The first classes were located in the Redick Mansion, once at North 24th and Pratt Streets, from 1909 through 1917. As the university was established a few blocks north of the Presbyterian Theological Seminary, most of its early faculty were recruited from Seminary teachers, as well as the faculty of what was then known as Bellevue College. There were 26 students in the first year, most of whom had graduated from Omaha Central High School. Three of the University's first four presidents were ordained Presbyterian ministers.\\"History of Omaha at a glance\\" , Douglas County Historical Society. Retrieved 4/10/08. p 65.(1993) A History of UNO . University of Nebraska Omaha. Retrieved 5/29/07. Two other buildings on the original campus included Jacobs Hall, a gymnasium erected in 1910, and Joslyn Hall, a classroom building erected in 1917. Jacobs Hall was a gymnasium facing North 24th Street, built with $14,000 from the sale of land donated by Lillian Maul. The land, the first donation to the university, was near the present West Dodge campus of the university. It was the first new building constructed on the university campus. Joslyn Hall was built with funds donated by a well- known resident, George A. Joslyn. Donating $25,000 toward the building, he stipulated the school match that with another $25,000 in a year. The building was located just north of Redick Hall and was finished in January 1917. Joslyn Hall had three stories and a basement, with a total of thirty classrooms that accommodated 750 students. The building included chemistry and physics laboratories, an auditorium and music department.\\"Old campus fades into oblivion\\", UNO Alumni Newsletter. August 1964. Retrieved 4/29/08. Redick Hall was sold and moved in February 1917 to Minnesota, where it was adapted for use in a resort. In the early 1920s a proposed \\"magnificent campus\\" was slated for development between 21st and 25th Avenues, bounded by Kountze Park and the Carter Lake Park. In 1927, businessmen formed the North Omaha Activities Association in order to redevelop Saratoga School's playing field into a football field for the University's football team. With new bleachers built to accommodate a crowd of one thousand, the Saratoga Field was home to OU's football team until 1951.Saratoga Field University of Nebraska Omaha website. The school also served as OU's science call from 1917 to 1926.\\"West Dodge Campus Choice Gave Unique Building Design\\", The Gateway - UNO. Retrieved 3/26/08. =Change to public university status= The university became a public municipal institution in 1930, and it moved from the North Omaha campus to its present main location at 60th and Dodge Street in 1938. The old campus buildings were redeveloped for a time as apartments and offices. In June 1964 Jacobs and Joslyn halls were the last two original OU buildings at 24th & Pratt Streets to be demolished. They were taken down in the early 1960s to make way for a 12-story Omaha Housing Authority apartment building for the elderly, which was completed in 1965. Dr. Milo Bail became president of Omaha University in 1948 and served until 1965. During that time, Omaha hotel magnate Eugene C. Eppley's foundation gave more than $1.2 million to the university. After Eppley's passing, the Eppley Foundation donated another $50,000 to recruit distinguished professors. The Eugene C. Eppley Administration Building, designed by John Latenser, Sr., at the university was named in recognition of the gifts.\\"There's more to UNO buildings that just a name\\" , Gateway. July 10, 2004.

Seldom referred to as Lord Rector, the incumbent is more commonly known just as the Rector. , the current Rector is Ann Henderson, the second- ever woman to hold the post.  Role  The Rector chairs the University's highest governing body, the University Court; in addition the Rector chairs meetings of the General Council in the absence of the Chancellor. In more recent years the role has included a function akin to that of an ombudsperson for the university community. In their position, the Rector can exert considerable influence in Court and in the body politic of the University. They can be well-informed about student and staff issues and concerns, can champion their causes, and can make sure that these issues are fully aired in Court.  History  The position of Rector, along with the positions of Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor, was only created in 1858. Prior to this, the University was governed by the Lord Provost, Magistrates, and town council of Edinburgh. The rector's place in the university was codified by statute of the Westminster Parliament, the Universities (Scotland) Act 1889, which provided for the election of a Rector at all universities then in existence in Scotland. To this day only the ancient universities of Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and St Andrews plus the newer Dundee, elect a Rector; the 20th century universities do not. In 1935 students went to great lengths to invite Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky to become Rector, Trotsky turned down the offer stating: \\"The elections to the rectorate are conducted on a non- political basis and your letter itself is signed by representatives of every political tendency. But I myself occupy too definite a political position. … [I could not] appear on any public tribune not under the Bolshevik banner.\\" Successful candidates are typically well-known figures with some connection to the city. Gordon Brown was unusual in being elected at the age of 21 while still a student, several years before he became politically prominent. The 2009 election was won by political journalist Iain Macwhirter. Macwhirter defeated Labour peer and MSP Lord Foulkes to become the University's 50th Rector, earning 4,822 votes, or 69% of the total vote.Iain Macwhirter chosen as Edinburgh’s 50th Rector  News  News and events Respect politician George Galloway withdrew his candidacy on 6 February 2009.  Current Rector  In February 2018, Ann Henderson was voted Rector, becoming the second woman to hold the position following Muriel Gray. She beat the only other candidate, Marco Bauder, with 77% of the vote. She replaced the outgoing Rector, Steve Morrison.

That is, until I read Journey by Moonlight.\\" Plot introduction The novel follows Mihály, a Budapest native from a bourgeois family on his honeymoon in Italy as he encounters and attempts to make sense of his past. The novel features his romantic figure, aloof and poetic, but struggling to break with an adolescent rebelliousness which he tries to quell under respectable bourgeois conformism, but also with the disturbing attraction of an erotic death-wish. Some of the neurotic episodes that Mihály experiences throughout the story have been understood as motifs related to Freudian psychoanalysis, which had been especially influential at the time in Hungary.

Current issues The Bank of Canada, Canada's sole issuer of bank notes, currently issues five different denominations ($5, $10, $20, $50 and $100). Smaller denominations have been replaced by coins, and larger ones are felt to be no longer required in an era of electronic transmission of most large transactions. Despite competition from some more valuable foreign notes (most notably, the 500 euro banknote), there are no plans to re-issue Canadian banknotes larger than $100. Defunct currency $1 Dominion of Newfoundland note issued in 1920 25¢ Dominion of Canada note issued in 1923 $10 Bank of Montreal note issued in 1935 Notes issued by these former issuing authorities are considered to be withdrawn from circulation: * Colonial governments, prior to each entering confederation. * The Dominion of Canada between 1870 and 1935, which issued notes in denominations of 25¢, $1, $2, $4, $5, $50, $100, $500, and $1,000 * Canadian chartered banks, from pre-Confederation to 1944. Bank of Canada notes $25 Bank of Canada note issued in 1935 $1,000 Bank of Canada note issued in 1954 All Bank of Canada notes issued prior to the current Frontier Series are being withdrawn from circulation. The following Bank of Canada denominations included in previous series have been permanently retired: =$25= The $25 note was issued only in 1935, to commemorate the silver jubilee of King George V. As with other 1935 issues, separate English and French versions were printed. This was a limited release that was never printed in large quantities. The note was coloured an appropriate royal purple; both the King & his consort Queen Mary were featured, with Windsor Castle appearing on the back. The $25 note was withdrawn from circulation in 1937. =$500= The $500 denomination was included only in the 1935 series. No note of this denomination has been printed since. The note was coloured sepia, or burnt sienna; the face featured Sir John A. Macdonald, and the back depicted a fertility allegory. The $500 note was withdrawn from circulation in 1938. There had been two previous printings of the $500 note by the Dominion of Canada, one in 1925 featuring King George V, and one in 1911 picturing Queen Mary. Of the latter, only three are known to still exist, one of which sold for US$322,000 in a Heritage auction in October 2008.2008 September Long Beach, CA CAA Signature Auction #3502 Heritage Auctions It is unlikely that further 1911 notes survived the Depression. =$1= Printing of the $1 note ceased in 1989 after the release of the loonie (in 1987) had been implemented. These notes are virtually never seen in circulation today. The most recent banknote series that included the $1 note was the Scenes of Canada, with the $1 note released in 1974, coloured green and black. The face featured a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II; the back featured an image of Parliament Hill from across the Ottawa River, with log driving activities taking place on the water. =$2= Printing of the $2 note ceased on February 18, 1996, with initial release of the toonie, a coin that replaced it. These notes are seldom seen in circulation today. The most recent banknote series that included the two-dollar note was the Birds of Canada series in 1986, in which this note was a terra cotta colour. The face featured a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II; the back featured a meadow scene with two robins. Prior to the withdrawal of the $1 note, the $2 was not as widely circulated and was difficult to find in some regions, Alberta in particular. After the $1 note was withdrawn, the $2 was much more widely circulated. =$1,000= Printing of the $1,000 note ceased in 2000. The denomination was withdrawn on the advice of the Solicitor General and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), as it was often used for money laundering and organized crime. The Bank of Canada has requested that financial institutions return $1,000 notes for destruction. The most recent issue of this denomination was in 1992 as part of the Birds of Canada series. It was pink in colour, featuring Queen Elizabeth II on the face, and two pine grosbeaks on the back. Status of withdrawn banknotes Currency withdrawn from circulation remains legal tender, but this does not oblige any creditor to accept it as a medium of exchange. Withdrawn currency is usually exchanged at commercial bank branches, though some banks require that exchangers be bank customers. The bank then returns the withdrawn currency, together with worn out currency, to the Bank of Canada for destruction. Liabilities for outstanding provincial and Dominion of Canada notes was transferred to the Bank of Canada in 1935, and liability for chartered bank notes in 1950. As of December 31, 2016, the total value of provincial, Dominion, chartered bank, and discontinued Bank of Canada denominations still outstanding is $1.139 billion, of which more than $765 million is in $1,000 notes. The liability for this amount remains on the Bank of Canada's books up to the present day. On February 27, 2018, The Government of Canada announced in their 2018 Federal Budget that there are plans to make all withdrawn banknotes no longer legal tender. If passed into law, these notes will still retain face value and may still be redeemed at banks in exchange for current banknotes. The current five denominations - $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100 - will not be affected at this time, but the government may decide to remove legal tender status from older series versions of these denominations in the future.

It is used to treat thyroid hormone deficiency, including the severe form known as myxedema coma. It may also be used to treat and prevent certain types of thyroid tumors. It is not indicated for weight loss. Levothyroxine is taken by mouth or given by injection into a vein. Maximum effect from a specific dose can take up to six weeks to occur. Side effects from excessive doses include weight loss, trouble tolerating heat, sweating, anxiety, trouble sleeping, tremor, and fast heart rate. Use is not recommended in people who have had a recent heart attack. Use during pregnancy has been found to be safe. Dosing should be based on regular measurements of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and T4 levels in the blood. Much of the effect of levothyroxine is following its conversion to triiodothyronine (T3). Levothyroxine was first made in 1927. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Levothyroxine is available as a generic medication. Levothyroxine was the third-most commonly prescribed medication in the United States in 2017, with more than 101 million prescriptions.  Medical use  Levothyroxine is typically used to treat hypothyroidism, and is the treatment of choice for people with hypothyroidism, who often require lifelong thyroid hormone therapy. It may also be used to treat goiter via its ability to lower thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which is considered goiter-inducing. Levothyroxine is also used as interventional therapy in people with nodular thyroid disease or thyroid cancer to suppress TSH secretion. A subset of people with hypothyroidism treated with an appropriate dose of levothyroxine will describe continuing symptoms despite TSH levels in the normal range. In these people, further laboratory and clinical evaluation is warranted, as they may have another cause for their symptoms. Furthermore, reviewing their medications and possible dietary supplements is important, as several medications can affect thyroid hormone levels. Levothyroxine is also used to treat subclinical hypothyroidism, which is defined by an elevated TSH level and a normal-range free T4 level without symptoms. Such people may be asymptomatic and whether they should be treated is controversial. One benefit of treating this population with levothyroxine therapy is preventing development of hypothyroidism. As such, treatment should be taken into account for patients with initial TSH levels above 10 mIU/l, people with elevated thyroid peroxidase antibody titers, people with symptoms of hypothyroidism and TSH levels of 5–10 mIU/l, and women who are pregnant or want to become pregnant. Oral dosing for patients with subclinical hypothyroidism is 1 μg/kg/day. It is also used to treat myxedema coma, which is a severe form of hypothyroidism characterized by mental status changes and hypothermia. As it is a medical emergency with a high mortality rate, it should be treated in the intensive-care unit with thyroid hormone replacement and aggressive management of individual organ system complications. Generic levothyroxine, 25-μg oral tablet Dosages vary according to the age groups and the individual condition of the person, body weight, and compliance to the medication and diet. Other predictors of the required dosage are sex, body mass index, deiodinase activity (SPINA-GD), and etiology of hypothyroidism. Annual or semiannual clinical evaluations and TSH monitoring are appropriate after dosing has been established. Levothyroxine is taken on an empty stomach about half an hour to an hour before meals. As such, thyroid replacement therapy is usually taken 30 minutes prior to eating in the morning. For patients with trouble taking levothyroxine in the morning, bedtime dosing is effective, as well. A study in 2015 showed greater efficacy of levothyroxine when taken at bedtime. Doses of levothyroxine that normalize serum TSH may not normalize abnormal levels of LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol. Poor compliance in taking the medicine is the most common cause of elevated TSH levels in people receiving appropriate doses of levothyroxine. = Elderly = For older people (over 50 years old) and people with known or suspected ischemic heart disease, levothyroxine therapy should not be initiated at the full replacement dose. Since thyroid hormone increases the heart's oxygen demand by increasing heart rate and contractility, starting at higher doses may cause an acute coronary syndrome or an abnormal heart rhythm. = Pregnancy and breastfeeding = According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration pregnancy categories, levothyroxine has been assigned category A. Given that no increased risk of congenital abnormalities has been demonstrated in pregnant women taking levothyroxine, therapy should be continued during pregnancy. Furthermore, therapy should be immediately administered to women diagnosed with hypothyroidism during pregnancy, as hypothyroidism is associated with a higher rate of complications, such as spontaneous abortion, preeclampsia, and premature birth. Thyroid hormone requirements increase during and last throughout pregnancy. As such, pregnant women are recommended to increase to nine doses of levothyroxine each week, rather than the usual seven, as soon as their pregnancy is confirmed. Repeat thyroid function tests should be done five weeks after the dosage is increased. While a minimal amount of thyroid hormones is found in breast milk, the amount does not influence infant plasma thyroid levels. Furthermore, levothyroxine was not found to cause any adverse events to the infant or mother during breastfeeding. As adequate concentrations of thyroid hormone are required to maintain normal lactation, appropriate levothyroxine doses should be administered during breastfeeding. = Children = Levothyroxine is safe and effective for children with hypothyroidism; the goal of treatment for children with hypothyroidism is to reach and preserve normal intellectual and physical development.  Contraindications  Levothyroxine is contraindicated in people with hypersensitivity to levothyroxine sodium or any component of the formulation, people with acute myocardial infarction, and people with thyrotoxicosis of any etiology. Levothyroxine is also contraindicated for people with uncorrected adrenal insufficiency, as thyroid hormones may cause an acute adrenal crisis by increasing the metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids. For oral tablets, the inability to swallow capsules is an additional contraindication. Side effects Adverse events are generally caused by incorrect dosing. Long-term suppression of TSH values below normal values frequently cause cardiac side effects and contribute to decreases in bone mineral density (low TSH levels are also well known to contribute to osteoporosis). Too high a dose of levothyroxine causes hyperthyroidism. Overdose can result in heart palpitations, abdominal pain, nausea, anxiousness, confusion, agitation, insomnia, weight loss, and increased appetite. Allergic reactions to the drug are characterized by symptoms such as difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, or swelling of the face and tongue. Acute overdose may cause fever, hypoglycemia, heart failure, coma, and unrecognized adrenal insufficiency. Acute massive overdose may be life-threatening; treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Massive overdose can be associated with increased sympathetic activity, thus may require treatment with beta-blockers. The effects of overdosing appear 6 hours to 11 days after ingestion.  Interactions  Many foods and other substances can interfere with absorption of thyroxine. Substances that reduce absorption are aluminium- and magnesium- containing antacids, simethicone, sucralfate, cholestyramine, colestipol, and polystyrene sulfonate. Grapefruit juice may delay the absorption of levothyroxine, but based on a study of 10 healthy people aged 20–30 (eight men, two women), it may not have a significant effect on bioavailability in young adults. A study of eight women suggested that coffee may interfere with the intestinal absorption of levothyroxine, though at a level less than eating bran. Certain other substances can cause adverse effects that may be severe. Combination of levothyroxine with ketamine may cause hypertension and tachycardia; and tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants increase its toxicity. Lithium, though, can cause hyperthyroidism (but most often hypothyroidism) by affecting iodine metabolism of the thyroid itself, thus inhibiting synthetic levothyroxine, as well. Soy, walnuts, fiber, calcium supplements, and iron supplements can also adversely affect absorption. A study found that cow's milk reduces levothyroxine absorption. To minimize interactions, a manufacturer of levothyroxine recommends after taking it, waiting 30 minutes to one hour before eating or drinking anything that is not water. They further recommend to take it in the morning on an empty stomach.  Mechanism of action  Levothyroxine is a synthetic form of thyroxine (T4), an endogenous hormone secreted by the thyroid gland, which is converted to its active metabolite, -triiodothyronine (T3). T4 and T3 bind to thyroid receptor proteins in the cell nucleus and cause metabolic effects through the control of DNA transcription and protein synthesis. Like its naturally secreted counterpart, levothyroxine is a chiral compound in the -form.  Pharmacokinetics  Absorption of orally administered levothyroxine from the gastrointestinal tract ranges from 40 to 80%, with the majority of the drug absorbed from the jejunum and upper ileum. Levothyroxine absorption is increased by fasting and decreased in certain malabsorption syndromes, by certain foods, and with age. The bioavailability of the drug is decreased by dietary fiber. Greater than 99% of circulating thyroid hormones are bound to plasma proteins including thyroxine-binding globulin, transthyretin (previously called thyroxine-binding prealbumin), and albumin. Only free hormone is metabolically active. The primary pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism is through sequential deiodination. The liver is the main site of T4 deiodination, and along with the kidneys, are responsible for about 80% of circulating T3. In addition to deiodination, thyroid hormones are also excreted through the kidneys and metabolized through conjugation and glucuronidation and excreted directly into the bile and the gut, where they undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Half-life elimination is 6–7 days for people with normal lab results; 9–10 days for people with hypothyroidism; 3–4 days for people with hyperthyroidism. Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys (about 80%), with urinary excretion decreasing with age. The remaining 20% of T4 is eliminated in the stool. History Thyroxine was first isolated in pure form in 1914, at the Mayo Clinic by Edward Calvin Kendall from extracts of hog thyroid glands. The hormone was synthesized in 1927 by British chemists Charles Robert Harington and George Barger. Society and cultureEconomics= , levothyroxine was the second-most commonly prescribed medication in the U.S., with 23.8 million prescriptions filled each year. In 2016, it became the most commonly prescribed medication in the U.S., with more than 114 million prescriptions. =Available forms= Levothyroxine for systemic administration is available as an oral tablet, an intramuscular injection, and as a solution for intravenous infusion. Furthermore, it is available as both brand-name and generic products. While the FDA approved the use of generic levothyroxine for brand-name levothyroxine in 2004, the decision was met with disagreement by several medical associations. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE), the Endocrine Society, and the American Thyroid Association did not agree with the FDA that brand-name and generic formulations of levothyroxine were bioequivalent. As such, people were recommended to be started and kept on either brand-name or generic levothyroxine formulations and not changed back and forth from one to the other. For people who do switch products, their TSH and free T4 levels should be tested after six weeks to check that they are within normal range. Common brand names include Eltroxin, Euthyrox, Eutirox, Letrox, Levaxin, Lévothyrox, Levoxyl, -thyroxine, Thyrax, and Thyrax Duotab in Europe; Thyrox and Thyronorm in South Asia; Unithroid, Eutirox, Synthroid, and Tirosint in North and South America; and Thyrin and Thyrolar in Bangladesh. Numerous generic versions also are available. The related drug dextrothyroxine (-thyroxine) was used in the past as a treatment for hypercholesterolemia (elevated cholesterol levels), but was withdrawn due to cardiac side effects.

Leonard or Lienard became one of the most venerated saints of the late Middle Ages. His intercession was credited with miracles for the release of prisoners, women in labour and the diseases of cattle. Traditional biography According to the romance that accrued to his name, recorded in an 11th-century vita, Leonard was a Frankish noble in the court of Clovis I, founder of the Merovingian dynasty. He was converted to Christianity along with the king, at Christmas 496, by Saint Remigius, Bishop of Reims. Leonard asked Clovis to grant him personally the right to liberate prisoners whom he would find worthy of it, at any time. Leonard secured the release of a number of prisoners, for whom he has become a patron saint, then, declining the offer of a bishopric-- a prerogative of Merovingian nobles-- he entered the monastery at Micy near Orléans, under the direction of Saint Mesmin and Saint Lie. Then, according to his legend, Leonard became a hermit in the forest of Limousin, where he gathered a number of followers. Through his prayers the queen of the Franks safely bore a male child, and in recompense Leonard was given royal lands at Noblac, from Limoges. It is likely that the toponym was derived from the Latin family name Nobilius and the common Celtic element -ac, simply denoting a place. There he founded the abbey of Noblac, around which a village grew, named in his honour Saint-Léonard-de-Noblat. According to legend, prisoners who invoked him from their cells saw their chains break before their eyes. Many came to him afterwards, bringing their heavy chains and irons to offer them in homage. A considerable number remained with him, and he often gave them part of his vast forest to clear and make ready for the labours of the fields, that they might have the means to live an honest life. Diffusion of cult In the 12th century, although there is no previous mention of Leonard either in literature, liturgy or in church dedications,R. W. Mumford, St Leonard's Anglican Church 1896 - 1988. Denmark, W.A.: St. Leonard's Anglican Church, 1991 his cult rapidly spread, at first through Frankish lands, following the release of Bohemond I of Antioch in 1103 from a Danishmend prison, where the successful diplomacy was inspired by Leonard of Noblac. Bohemond, a charismatic leader of the First Crusade, subsequently visited the Abbey of Noblac, where he made an offering in gratitude for his release. Bohemond's example inspired many similar gifts, enabling the Romanesque church and its prominent landmark belltower to be constructed. About the same time Noblac was becoming a stage in the pilgrimage route that led towards Santiago de Compostela. Leonard's cult spread through all of Western Europe: in England, with its cultural connections to the region, no fewer than 177 churches are dedicated to him. Leonard was venerated in Scotland, the Low Countries, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, particularly in Bavaria, and also in Bohemia, Poland, and elsewhere. Pilgrims and patronage flowed to Saint-Leonard de Noblac. Leonard or Lienard became one of the most venerated saints of the late Middle Ages. His intercession was credited with miracles for the release of prisoners, women in labour and the diseases of cattle. His feast day is 6 November, when he is honoured with a festival at Bad Tölz, Bavaria. He is honoured by the parish of Kirkop, Malta on the third Sunday of every August. Veneration Romanesque church of St Leonard in Saint-Léonard- de-Noblat, Haute-Vienne Since the vita written in the 11th century is without historical value according to the Catholic Encyclopedia, one may approach the legendary Saint Leonard, whose bones lie in the Romanesque collegial church, by means of the historic village, instead of the other way around. The growing tide of pilgrims passing on their way to Santiago inspired romances to publicize more than one locally venerated saint along the pilgrim routes. Saint Martial is another example of a saint of the Limousin whose dramatic vita helped attract pilgrims to his shrine. The village below the shrine of Saint Leonard, perched on its hilltop site, had its origins in the 11th century, when under the jurisdiction of the château of Noblac it was first encircled with walls, a necessity of life in the region. It developed as a small center of commerce in the 13th century, based on forges and foundries (perhaps the origin of the saint's association with chains) and leatherworking, with communal consuls who were in charge of defending its rights and privileges -its \\"liberties\\" in the medieval sense. A history of the commune, written by the local antiquary and historian of the Limousin, Louis Guibert in 1890, was reissued in 1992. Today Saint-Léonard-de-Noblat, Haute- Vienne, population 4766 in 1999, is one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites connected with the routes to Santiago. It retains the Romanesque collegial church and its belltower, tall. Its old houses follow a medieval street pattern, with many streets converging in a public space by the former abbey church. In the 19th century, a papermill and a porcelain manufactory were added to its commerce. The place is now also attracting visitors as an overnight stop on the Tour de France. The town is also famous for its native son, the scientist Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac (1778 - 1850); there is a small museum in his honor. In the Alpine regions of Bavaria, St Leonard is regarded as the traditional patron of farmers. Many Bavarian communities carry out traditional processions or rides on his feast day; community members wear traditional costume, usually dirndls for the women and Lederhosen for the men.Ulrike Kretschmer, Frank Duffek and Bettina Schippel, Bayerischen Alpen: Traum in weiss-blau, Reader´s Digest, Stuttgart, 2013, pp. 54-56. Notable dedications Various places refer to this saint. Notable among these is the town of St Leonards-on-Sea in East Sussex. Sussex is also home to St Leonard's Forest. This part of England has a significant number of dedications to St Leonard. Some of the best-known are the Parish church of St Leonard in Hythe, Kent, with its famous ossuary in the ambulatory situated beneath its chancel and St. Leonard's St. Leonard%27s, Shoreditch in Shoreditch London. There is a cluster of dedications in the West Midlands region, including the original parish churches of Bridgnorth (now a redundant church and used for community purposes) and Bilston, as well as White Ladies Priory, a ruined Augustinian house. The largest hospital in northern mediaeval England was an Augustinian foundation dedicated to St. Leonard, in York. Its partial ruins are to be found in the Museum Gardens although undercroft remains lie some hundred yards away and are used as a bar under the York Theatre Royal. In Newton Abbot, Devon, there is both a Chapel of Ease dedicated to St Leonard, first recorded in 1350, and a replacement Church built in 1834. The Chapel was near the bridewell (prison). There is also a church dedicated to St Leonard in Wallingford, Oxfordshire. The church is Saxon in origin but it was heavily rebuilt in 1849 in the Victorian gothic revival style by architect Henry Hakewill. Several German churches are dedicated to the saint, including St. Leonhard, Frankfurt. In Italy almost 225 places are dedicated to the saint, equally distributed in the North (in Friuli there's the oldest Italian church dedicated to this saint 774) as well as in the South where the shrine was introduced by the Normans. The shrine can be found even in Italian islands such as Sicily, Sardinia, Ischia, Procida. In September 2004, a National Meeting of the Italian parish churches dedicated to the Saint took place in the small village of Panza d'Ischia where a small chapel of St. Leonard was transformed into a church in 1536.:it:Panza The Mediterranean nation of Malta contains a single parish dedicated to this saint, in the town of Kirkop. Kirkop's parish church was founded on 29 May 1592. The saint is known as San Anard Abbati in Maltese. In Portugal the parish and church (late 12th century) of Atouguia da Baleia (Peniche) is dedicated to Saint Leonard. The saint's day is commemorated every 6 November (or the closest Sunday). This is the only parish dedicated to Saint Leonard in the whole country.

It was during this period that Welsh packs became far less dominant than in the glory days of the 1970s and Davies, along with David Pickering and Bob Norster, was one of the few class forwards that his side could muster. The mustachioed Davies was a useful addition to the side mostly because of his offensive ability and the fact that he could play either as flanker, number eight or lock forward. His career is also memorable for his involvement in the so-called \\"Battle of Cardiff\\" in 1987, an extremely violent clash between Wales and England that saw Davies wind up on the wrong end of lock Wade Dooley's fist. Davies' first international appearance came in a 24–15 victory over England in Cardiff, a game that saw his brother-in-law, Jonathan Davies, also make his debut. England, who had not won in Cardiff since 1963, led the game 15–12, before fullback Chris Martin failed to take a high kick and Davies (Jonathan) scored a crucial try. Davies' next appearance came in a 40–3 victory against Fiji at the Arms Park, and he marked the occasion by scoring two of his side's seven tries. The following year Davies played in seven tests in total, but was denied a possible Triple Crown when his side were beaten 21–18 by England in the first match of the campaign. Wales recovered to beat Scotland and Ireland before losing to France. Davies and his teammates then embarked on a short tour of the Southern Hemisphere as part of the side's preparation for the 1987 Rugby World Cup and included victories over Fiji, Tonga and Western Samoa. The games against Fiji and Samoa passed with relatively little incident, but the Tonga test was notable for its violence and both Davies and Adrian Hadley found themselves on the receiving end of opposition fists, not for the last time in Davies' case. =Honours= Wales *Five Nations Championship **Winners: 1988 (Joint with France), 1994 **Runner-up: 1986 *Triple Crown **Winners: 1988 Llanelli RFC *Welsh Premier Division **Winners: 1993 *WRU Challenge Cup **Winners: 1985, 1988, 1991, 1992, 1993 **Runner-up: 1989, 1994 Coaching careerLeeds (1996–2006)= Davies was director of rugby at Leeds Tykes from 1996 to 2006 before resigning his post. When he first took charge in 1996 Leeds where in National Division Four, where in his debut season the club finished third, two places above the previous season. In 1998, they were promoted up to the Allied Dunbar Premiership Two finishing in sixth place, before finishing runner-up to Rotherham in 1999–2000. In 2001, Davies lead Leeds to the National Division One title, losing just two games all season. They were therefore promoted to the top elite tournament for the 2001–02 English Premiership season. Despite winning six games during the season, and performed well in the 2001–02 Parker Pen Shield, they finished bottom of the table, but avoided relegation due to the inadequacies of Rotherham's ground. In the 2002–03 English Premiership season, Davies led Leeds to fifth with 12 victories, and the second round of the 2002–03 European Challenge Cup. In 2004 Leeds finished 11th, but did however secure seven victories to place them 34 points clear of relegated team Rotherham. In their debut season of the Heineken Cup, Leeds gained a single victory, a 29–20 win over Neath-Swansea Ospreys. Davies left his post at Leeds after they were relegated at the end of the 2005–06 English Premiership season.Davies takes leave of Leeds after 10 years Davies said at the time: \\"I have no immediate plans to go elsewhere, rather I just feel it's time to take a break. I want to make it clear this mutual decision has nothing to do with the current situation at Leeds. It is after much soul searching and discussion with my family and Leeds Tykes that I have decided to resign my post.\\" Davies added: \\"The last 10 years has been an amazing journey with a fantastic group of people, helping to take the club from National League Three to Heineken Cup rugby and winning the Powergen Cup last season. I will have some time out with my family and reflect upon my career and future, after a decade at this wonderful club.\\" =Return to Wales (2006)= In August 2006, he returned to his former playing club, the Scarlets after being appointed Director of Rugby.Scarlets unveil Davies as coach In his first season in charge at the region, he guided the side to a fourth-placed finish in the 2006–07 Celtic League, while also leading the side to the semi-finals of the 2006–07 Heineken Cup, losing to Leicester Tigers 33–17.

In April 2008, it was announced that the Scarlets had sacked Davies, and that the 10 May clash with Edinburgh would be his last.Scarlets part company with Davies After leaving Llanelli, he served as a consultant head coach with Cardiff RFC from November 2008 until May 2009. Where after he became National Academy Manager for the Welsh Rugby Union, where he was responsible for developing an international pathway at the WRU.

He helped return Worcester back to the Premiership after they won the 2010–11 RFU Championship with just one loss all season. His work with the forwards saw Worcester stay afloat in the Premiership, finishing tenth in the 2011–12 English Premiership. In May 2012 Davies joined Cardiff Blues as Director of Rugby. His first competitive match in charge was a 13–9 win over Connacht on 1 September 2012. Between 22 September and 25 November, the Blues suffered six consecutive losses, before winning just their fourth game of the season against Zebre 14–7. On 19 January 2013, Davies earned his first Heineken Cup win, after beating Sale Sharks 26–14 in the final pool round of the 2012–13 season. At the end of the 2012–13 Pro12, Davies had led Cardiff Blues to ninth on the table, their lowest ever position since the 2004–05 Celtic League. During the 2013–14 Pro12, the Blues finished seventh in the table with 8 victories, however 4 of those victories came after Davies resigned mid-season, leaving the club on 3 March 2014 after his side's recent run of poor results.Phil Davies: Cardiff Blues director of rugby resigns However, during the 2013–14 Heineken Cup, Davies did lead the side to a 19–15 win over reigning champions Toulon on the 19 October 2013, before winning back-to-back against Glasgow Warriors 29–20 and 9–7.

He helped see RGC promoted up to the Principality Premiership for their first ever time, before standing down as head coach at the end of that season to concentrate on his duties with Namibia.Phil Davies to leave RGC at end of the season =Namibia (2014–2019)= After leaving Cardiff in March 2014, it was announced in November that year that Davies was appointed as technical adviser for the Namibian national side ahead of the 2015 Rugby World Cup. He began his role during Namibia's 2014 November internationals against Canada, the French Barbarians and Portugal. Despite strong performances, Namibia failed to win any of the games, losing 17–13, 35–14 and 29–20. He remained with the side during the 2015 World Rugby Nations Cup as an adviser, and after losing all three games then head coach Danie Vermeulen stood down on the 25 June 2015. Head Coach of Namibia On 26 June 2015, it was announced that Davies would become Namibia's new head coach following the resignation of Vermeulen. Davies moved from the technical advisory role he held from 2014, to the head coach role just 3 months before Namibia participated in the 2015 Rugby World Cup, and Davies first match in charge was on 11 July 2015 against Russia. Namibia claimed their first ever victory over Russia, beating them 39–19, before claiming a 45–5 win the following week to claim the series 2–0.

Metal theft is \\"the theft of items for the value of their constituent metals\\". It usually increases when worldwide prices for scrap metal rise, as has happened dramatically due to rapid industrialization in India and China. Apart from precious metals like gold and silver, the metals most commonly stolen are non-ferrous metals such as copper, aluminium, brass, and bronze. However, even cast iron and steel are seeing higher rates of theft due to increased scrap metal prices. One defining characteristic of metal theft is the motivation. Whereas other items are generally stolen for their extrinsic value, items involved in metal theft are stolen for their intrinsic value as raw material or commodities. Thefts often have negative consequences much greater than the value of the metal stolen, such as the destruction of valuable statues, power interruptions, and the disruption of railway traffic. Motivations for theft Global copper prices from 1986 to 2011 Police check a scrap van for questionable items (UK) Scrap metal has drastically increased in price over recent years. In 2001, ferrous scrap sold for $77 a ton, increasing to $300/ton by 2004. In 2008, it hit nearly $500/ton. Some elected officials and law enforcement officials have concluded that many metal thefts are by drug addicts stealing metal in order to fund their addictions. Some officials believe that many of these drug- related metal thefts are caused by methamphetamine users; however, this varies by the location of the metal being stolen. Another explanation for the phenomenon is the unusually high price of non-ferrous metals coupled with elevated levels of unemployment. Regardless of the reason, the industrialization of developing nations helps to increase the demand for scrap metal. In the fourth quarter of 2008, world market prices for metals like copper, aluminium, and platinum dropped steeply. Although there is anecdotal evidence that this price decrease has led to fewer metal thefts, strong empirical research on the exact nature of the relationship between commodity prices and metal thefts is still lacking. Some have argued that the \\"genie is out of the bottle\\" now and drops in commodity prices will not result in corresponding drops in thefts. In fact, it is possible that thefts may actually increase to compensate for the loss in value. As of December 2014 according to The National Insurance Crime Bureau the number of insurance claims for metal theft has been decreasing in the U.S possibly because of dropping scrap metal prices.  Economic impact  in the United States alone, metal theft costs the US economy $1 billion annually, according to Department of Energy estimates. As of 2008 It was estimated that South Africa lost approximately 5 billion Rand annually due to metal theft. As of 2008 metal theft was the fastest growing crime in the UK with the annual damage to industry estimated at £360m. Thieves often cause damage far in excess of the value they recover by selling stolen metal as scrap. For example, thieves who strip copper plumbing and electrical wiring from houses render the residences uninhabitable without expensive, time-consuming repairs. Prevention Requiring scrap metal buyers to record the photo IDs of scrap metal sellers, and record scrap metal transactions may reduce the rate of metal theft. Paying scrap metal sellers by check rather than cash may reduce the rate of metal theft, and leaves records that can be investigated by police. Scrap merchants may refuse to accept certain commonly-stolen items, such as manhole covers, street signs, air-conditioning units, and railroad track components, unless the seller can prove legitimate ownership. Restrictions on some items have also been codified into law. Utility companies who are often the targets of metal theft can electroplate coding on to copper wire, which can positively identify the wire as stolen even if the insulation is burned off. Items often stolen Anything made of metal has value as scrap metal, and can be stolen: * Manhole covers * Copper wiring, or copper pipes from houses or other buildings * Utility company wiring and transformers * Aluminum or stainless steel beer kegs * Bronze or brass statues or monuments * Catalytic converters from motor vehicles (they contain precious metals) * Air conditioner units * Rails * Metal crosses and other ornaments from cemeteries Notable metal thefts and law enforcement efforts by countryAustralia= In Australia in 2008, 8 tonnes of copper wiring, believed to be stolen from a variety of locations including rail tracks, power stations and scrap metal depots, was seized on its way to the Asian black market. = Austria = All bronze components (portrait and letters) of this memorial have been removed (Vienna, Austria) In November 2011 a person tried to hand-saw a hot electrical line in a subway tunnel in Vienna. A fire arose; train traffic was stopped. The thief was probably hurt. In November 2015 a man burnt to death in Vienna in an empty building, one which had a 100 kV cable that went through the basement. The police found three people alive and assumed that they had been attempting to steal copper. In May 2013 the Westbahn near Amstetten had to be closed for safety reasons; grounding copper wires had been stolen; The copper stolen was worth €2,000, but total damages to the station cost upwards of €30,000. In July 2013 in Lower Austria () of copper wire worth less than €1,000 was stolen from a railway transformer station. The damage to the railways electronics cost €140,000. In May 2016, police caught several people that had stolen several tons of copper wire from a substation and caused 400,000 € worth of damage in Lower Austria. =Canada= In Quebec, during May 2006, thieves stole sections of copper roofing, gutters and wiring from four Quebec city churches, two being St. Charles de Limoilou and St. Francois d'Assise. The thieves were discovered in action on their third night, whereupon they fled. High copper prices are believed to be the reason for the thefts. Repairs were expected to cost more than $40,000. In October 2010, a bronze bell was stolen in Shelburne County, Nova Scotia. Thieves removed the bell from a monument in Roseway Cemetery. The bell was part of the Roseway United Memorial Church, built in 1912, until it was demolished in 1993. It was recovered in a Halifax- area scrapyard October 6, 2010. In September 2011, Peterborough, Ontario, experienced a four-hour power outage north of the city when thieves stole power transmission wires. =Czech Republic= 327 bronze markers stolen from Theresienstadt concentration camp cemetery in mid-April 2008, with 700 more stolen the next week. A scrap metal dealer was arrested on April 18, 2008. He intended to melt them down for their copper. A ten-tonne footbridge and of railway trackage, from the town of Horní Slavkov in the Karlovy Vary Region was dismantled and removed by a gang of thieves who presented forged papers saying that the bridge had been condemned. The bridge was erected in 1901. = France = The French railway network company RFF face regular thefts of metal that affect the operation of the trains. =Germany= In February 2006, near the German city of Weimar, thieves dismantled and carted away some of disused rail track, causing at least 200,000 euros worth of damage. In June 2012, a badly burned man was found alive on the side of a road in Wilhelmsburg. The man was believed to be part of a group of suspects stealing overhead contact wire from a nearby railway. 3 km of copper cable had been torn down before the accident occurred and the theft was aborted. In April 2016, a cast bronze owl was stolen from the grave of a 2-year-old child in Rommerkirchen. The €800 sculpture far exceeds the €20 scrap value. =Haiti= In Haiti, after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, some looters were reported to be removing rebar from the concrete of collapsed buildings in order to sell it. Others hacked up downed power lines. =India= In the city of Calcutta, India more than 10,000 manhole covers were taken in two months. These were replaced with concrete covers, but these were also stolen, this time for the rebar inside them. =Indonesia= In 2016, the sewers in Medan Merdeka avenue near National Monument, Central Jakarta, was discovered had been clogged with 10 truck loads of rubber-PVC cable jacket, causing flood in the area. Then it was discovered that the cables belongs to PT Telkom or PT PLN, state-owned telecommunication and electricity provider. The cable jacket was left clogging the sewer, while the metal thieves stole the inner copper wires. Several war graves in the Java Sea were discovered to have been removed by metal scavengers. The wrecks of , , and had been totally removed. A sizable portion of was also scavenged. The wrecks of , , and were also missing. =Netherlands= On 11 January 2011, the theft of of copper cable caused an ICE train to derail near the Dutch city of Zevenaar. Nobody was harmed. =Russia= In 2001, thieves in Khabarovsk Krai stole electric and telephone lines leading to military bases there. A small bridge was stolen in Russia in 2007, when a man chopped up its 5-meter span and hauled it away. =South Africa= Metal theft from a memorial at the Union Buildings, Pretoria Metal theft in South Africa is rampant, with an estimated R5 billion per annum lost due to the theft. The stolen metal ranges from copper cables, piping, bolts to manhole covers. The theft continuously disrupts and degrades services, such as the power supply provided by Eskom and the telecommunication services by Telkom. Eskom estimated that the theft has cost the company about R25 million per annum, with incidents increasing from 446 incidents in 2005; 1,059 in 2007 and 1,914 in 2008. The theft has cost Telkom R863 million (April 2007 – January 2008 period). Despite the minimal copper reserve South Africa has, as much as 3000 tonnes of copper leave Cape Town harbour every month. Aside from the economic impact, the theft also impacted people's lives, this includes the death of six children due to theft of manhole covers (2004–2008 figures). The theft of copper cables is a serious problem in Gauteng. =Ukraine= In February 2004, thieves in western Ukraine dismantled and stole an long, one- tonne steel bridge that spanned the river Svalyavka. In September 2009, smugglers attempted to make off with 25 tons of radioactive scrap metal from the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. The Security Service of Ukraine caught them. Ukraine's state gold reserves mysteriously disappeared in 2014. =United Kingdom= Aftermath of theft of a vintage metal postbox (UK) Significant rises in metal theft were observed during 2006–2007 in the UK, especially in North East England, where metal theft was still on the rise . In the UK, the British Metals Recycling Association is working with authorities such as the Association of Chief Police Officers and the British Transport Police to halt the problem of metal being stolen from its members' sites and to identify stolen materials. Also see Operation Tremor. Roofs, manhole covers, statues etc. have all been increasingly targeted recently due to the rising cost of metal. Most of the time metal is sold for scrap, but occasionally it is used by the thieves themselves. There have been many stories of metal theft; a bronze statue of former Olympic champion Steve Ovett disappeared from Preston Park in Brighton and church bells in Devon were stolen by thieves. A statue made by Henry Moore and estimated to be worth £300,000 was stolen from a museum in 2006, and believed to have been melted down for its scrap value of around £5,000. Churches, especially older churches, suffer as 'lead theft' from church (and other) roofs is on the rise. In late 2011 the police began a number of crackdowns on metal theft, the largest in South Yorkshire resulting in at least 22 arrests and the seizure of amateur smelting equipment. In August 2012, thieves stole 26 metal cages from an animal hospital in Kibworth, Leicestershire. Cages containing sick or injured animals were emptied by the thieves, leading to the death of eight animals and the escape of several others. The cages were worth about £30,000. Theft of copper cable by the side of railway tracks has also become increasingly a problem. Railway signal control cables are a common target, leading to serious safety issues and significant disruption for rail traffic. Theft of cables used for railway electrification is extremely dangerous to the perpetrator as well as bystanders as these systems are routinely energised to tens of thousands of volts. =United States= Historic cast iron fencing on the Longfellow Bridge was stolen before refurbishment, requiring expensive replacement castings to be fabricated. In Boston during the summer of 2008, two state employees stole of decorative iron trim that had been removed from the Longfellow Bridge for refurbishment and sold it for scrap. The men, one of whom was a Department of Conservation and Recreation district manager, were charged with receiving $12,147 for the historic original parapet coping. The estimated cost to remake the pieces, scheduled for replication by 2012, was over $500,000. The men were later convicted, in September 2009. In New Castle, Pennsylvania, two brothers dismantled a bridge by using a cutting torch to take it apart. Between September 16 and September 28, 2011, the brothers stole the entire bridge and then sold the steel for $5,000. Cities across the United States have become targets for metal thieves. Manhole cover thefts increased dramatically between 2007 and 2008, with Philadelphia as one of the hardest hit targets. Other cities dealing with this trend include Chicago, Illinois; Greensboro, North Carolina, Long Beach, California; and Palm Beach County, Florida. Copper wire thefts have also become increasingly common in the US. With copper prices at $3.70 a pound , compared to $0.60 a pound in 2002, people have been increasingly stealing copper wire from telephone and power company assets. Gangs have been created, a black market for copper wire has emerged, and men even have been injured and killed in power plants while trying to obtain copper wire. Other sources of stolen copper include railroad signal lines, grounding bars at electric substations, and even a bell stolen from a Buddhist temple in Tacoma, Washington, which was later recovered. For example, Georgia, like many other states, has seen enough copper crime that a special task force has been created to fight it. The Metro Atlanta Copper Task Force is led by the Atlanta Police Department and involves police and recyclers from surrounding metro areas, Georgia Power, and the Fulton County District Attorney's office. Many states around the nation have passed – or are exploring – legislation to combat the problem. A new Georgia law took effect in July 2007 making it a crime to knowingly buy stolen metal. It allows prosecutors to prosecute for the actual cost of returning property to original conditions, as many of these thefts dramatically hurt the surrounding property value. On September 1, 2007, Earl Thelander of Onawa, Iowa, became the United States' first innocent copper theft fatality. Thelander sustained second- and third-degree burns over 80% of his body during an August 28, 2007, explosion, after copper thieves stripped propane and water lines from a rural residence and let the home fill with gas. Thelander, who, along with his wife, was preparing the empty home for a new tenant, reported the burglary to the Monona County Sheriff's Office, who investigated the initial crime. Hours after local law enforcement sent the Thelanders home, Thelander returned to the home to see if officials had cleared the home for entry. With no law enforcement nor fire department personnel present, he entered the home, and, smelling no fumes, felt it safe to work. In the basement, he plugged in a fan to help dry water on the basement floor, the electricity sparking an explosion. In response to the growing concerns and the lack of hard numbers on these crimes in Indianapolis, the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD) and the University of Indianapolis Community Research Center (CRC) began in 2008 a collaborative effort to collect data on metal thefts. The Indianapolis Metal Theft Project gathers and analyzes a wide variety of data to provide a clearer understanding of the incidence, types, costs, and impacts of metal theft in Indianapolis in order to inform and implement strategies to reduce these crimes and their impacts. The Department of Justice's Office of Community- Oriented Policing and the Center for Problem-Oriented Policing published its 58th problem-solving guide in 2010 directed towards theft of scrap metal. Brandon Kooi provides a review of the problem in the US and internationally, followed by a number of suggested responses and what to consider in those responses. The International Association of Property Crime Investigators presents the annual National Metal Theft Investigation Seminar uniting law enforcement and corporate security to share, learn and network to combat metal theft. The Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries is one of the groups backing these educational efforts throughout the country. As the nation's trade association for the scrap recycling industry, ISRI provides members and community leaders with resources that they can use when facing the issue. They have also teamed with the National Crime Prevention Council (known for McGruff the Crime Dog and the “Take a Bite Out of Crime” slogan) in an effort to team with law enforcement and crime prevention organizations to fight and solve this problem, and have established a theft alert system that these groups can use. ISRI and the National Crime Prevention Council offer a number of tips for how to fight and prevent metal theft, including requiring photo ID and license plate information for every transaction, training employees on identifying stolen goods, and keeping good records that might be useful later.

It has a scattered distribution across Europe, closely following the range of its food plant. Where present it can be very common. The nominate subspecies E. pulchellata pulchellata is found in the British Isles, in Central Europe the subspecies is E. pulchellata intermedia. In the Pyrenees, it occurs to a height of 2,400 metres. Description The wingspan is 18–22 mm and the species is quite colourful for the genus, with alternating bands of dark brown and buffish orange on the forewings. In some races the buff bands can be very pale. There are dark crosslines. The hindwings are similarly marked but generally paler. It flies at night in May and June and is attracted to light. The larva is quite variable but is normally yellowish-green with purplish markings. It usually feeds inside foxglove flowers. Soon after hatching it seals the mouth of the flower with silk and feeds on the reproductive parts of the flower. The corolla of the flower persists on the plant after those of uninfested flowers have fallen. Somewhat surprisingly, given this very specialized feeding ecology, it has also been recorded feeding on Brassica oleracea in Malta.Natural History Museum HOSTS database The species overwinters as a pupa. The preferred habitat is the edge of woods, glades and park landscapes, gardens and warm mountain slopes.

Overview  Mass suicide sometimes occurs in religious settings. Defeated groups may resort to mass suicide rather than being captured. Suicide pacts are a form of mass suicide that are sometimes planned or carried out by small groups of depressed or hopeless people. Mass suicides have been used as a form of political protest, which shows that they can also be used as a statement making tool. Attitudes to mass suicide change according to place and circumstance. People who resort to mass suicide rather than submit to what they consider an intolerable oppression sometimes become the focus of a heroic myth. Such mass suicides might also win the grudging respect of the victors. On the other hand, the act of people resorting to mass suicide without being threatened - especially, when driven to this step by a charismatic religious leader, for reasons which often seem obscure - tends to be regarded far more negatively.  Historical mass suicides  * Following the destruction of Illiturgis by Roman General Publius Cornelius Scipio in 206 BC, people of Astapa - knowing they faced a similar fate - decided to kill themselves and burn the city with all of its treasures. * During the late 2nd century BC, the Teutons are recorded as marching south through Gaul along with their neighbors, the Cimbri, and attacking Roman Italy. After several victories for the invading armies, the Cimbri and Teutones were then defeated by Gaius Marius in 102 BC at the Battle of Aquae Sextiae (near present-day Aix-en-Provence). Their King, Teutobod, was taken in irons. The captured women committed mass suicide, which passed into Roman legends of Germanic heroism: by the conditions of the surrender three hundred of their married women were to be handed over to the Romans. When the Teuton matrons heard of this stipulation, they first begged the consul that they might be set apart to minister in the temples of Ceres and Venus; then, when they failed to obtain their request and were removed by the lictors, they slew their children and next morning were all found dead in each other's arms having strangled themselves in the night.Lucius Annaeus Florus, Epitome 1.38.16–17 and Valerius Maximus, Factorum et Dictorum Memorabilium 6.1.ext.3 * At the end of the fifteen months of the siege of Numantia in summer 133 BC most of the defeated Numantines, instead of surrendering, preferred to commit suicide and set fire to the city. * The 960 members of the Sicarii Jewish community at Masada collectively committed suicide in 73 AD rather than be conquered and enslaved by the Romans. Each man killed his wife and children, then the men drew lots and killed each other until the last man killed himself.Masada and the first Jewish revolt against Rome : Near East Tourist Industry, Steven Langfur 2003 Some modern scholars have questioned this account of the events. *In the 700s, the remnants of the Montanists were ordered by Byzantine Emperor Leo III to leave their religion and join Orthodox Christianity. They refused, locked themselves in their places of worship, and set them on fire. * In India, the mass suicide, also known as Jauhar, was carried out by women and men of the defeated community, when the fall of a city besieged by Muslim invaders was certain. Some of the known cases of Jauhar of Rajput women are at the fort of Chittaur in Rajasthan, in 1303, in 1535, and 1568.Rajasthan: Monique Choy, Sarina Singh p. 231 , Lonely Planet Publications, Oct 2002 * In 1336, when the castle of Pilėnai in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was besieged by the army of the Teutonic Knights, the defenders, led by the Duke Margiris, realized that it was impossible to defend themselves any longer and made the decision to commit mass suicide, as well as to set the castle on fire in order to destroy all of their possessions, and anything of value to the enemy.GEDIMINO LAIŠKAI: The Letters of Gediminas, the Great Duke of Lithuania (c. 1275–1341) * During the Great Schism of the Russian Church, entire villages of Old Believers burned themselves to death in an act known as \\"fire baptism\\". * In 1792, Revolutionary France abolished slavery in its Caribbean colonies. However, in 1802 Napoleon decided to restore slavery. In Guadeloupe, former slaves who refused to be re-enslaved started a rebellion, led by Louis Delgrès, and for some time resisted the French Army sent to suppress them - but finally realized that they could not win, and still they refused to surrender. At the Battle of Matouba on May 28, 1802, Delgrès and his followers - 400 men and some women - ignited their gunpowder stores, committing mass suicide while attempting to kill as many of the French troops as possible.http://pyepimanla.blogspot.co.uk/2009/07/louis-delgres-le-colonel- anti.html accessed 27 June 2012 * During the Turkish rule of Greece and shortly before the Greek War of Independence, women from Souli, pursued by the Ottomans, ascended the mount Zalongo, threw their children over the precipice and then jumped themselves, to avoid capture – an event known as the Dance of Zalongo.Memorials and Other Papers:Thomas de Quincey, * In the final phase of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, many of the fighters besieged in the \\"bunker\\" at Miła 18 committed mass suicide by ingesting poison rather than surrender to the Nazis. * Germany was stricken by a series of unprecedented waves of suicides during the final days of the Nazi regime. The reasons for these waves of suicides were numerous and include the effects of Nazi propaganda, the example of the suicide of Adolf Hitler, victims' attachment to the ideals of the Nazi Party, a reaction to the loss of the war and, consequently, the anticipated Allied occupation of Nazi Germany. Life Magazine speculated about the suicides: \\"In the last days of the war the overwhelming realization of utter defeat was too much for many Germans. Stripped of the bayonets and bombast which had given them power, they could not face a reckoning with either their conquerors or their consciences. These found the quickest and surest escape in what Germans call selbstmord, self-murder.\\"\\"Suicides: Nazis go down to defeat in a wave of selbstmord\\". Life Magazine, 14 May 1945. Accessed 10 April 2011. * On 1 May 1945, about 1,000 residents of Demmin, Germany, committed mass suicide after the Red Army had sacked the town. * A Balinese mass ritual suicide is called a puputan. Major puputan occurred in 1906–1908 when Balinese kingdoms faced overwhelming Dutch colonial forces. The root of the Balinese term puputan is puput, meaning 'finishing' or 'ending'. It is an act that is more symbolic than strategic; the Balinese are \\"a people whose genius for theatre is unsurpassed\\" and a puputan is viewed as \\"the last act of a tragic dance-drama\\". * Japan is known for its centuries of suicide tradition, from seppuku ceremonial self-disemboweling to kamikaze warriors flying their aircraft into Allied warships and banzai charge during World War II. During this same war, the Japanese forces announced to the people of Saipan that the invading American troops were going to torture and murder anyone on the island. In a desperate effort to avoid this, the people of Saipan committed suicide, mainly by jumping off the nearby cliffsides. Religiously motivated suicidesKnown suicides=Peoples Temple (1978) On November 18, 1978, 918 Americans died in Peoples Temple–related incidents, including 909 members of the Temple, led by Jim Jones, in Jonestown, Guyana.Foreword, The Assassination of Representative Leo J. Ryan and the Jonestown, Guyana Tragedy , excerpt from: Report of a Staff Investigative Group to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, U.S. House of Representatives, May 15, 1979 The dead included 276 children.

San Diego State University. On that tape, Jones tells Temple members that Russia, with whom the Temple had been negotiating a potential exodus for months, would not take them after the Temple had murdered Member of Congress Leo Ryan, NBC reporter Don Harris and three others at a nearby airstrip. When members apparently cried, Jones counseled \\"Stop this hysterics. This is not the way for people who are Socialists or Communists to die. No way for us to die. We must die with some dignity.\\" At the end of the tape, Jones concludes: \\"We didn't commit suicide, we committed an act of revolutionary suicide protesting the conditions of an inhumane world.\\" The people in Jonestown died of an apparent cyanide poisoning, except for Jones (who died of an injury consistent with a self-inflicted gunshot wound) and his personal nurse.Guyana Inquest of Cyrill Mootoo & Cecil Roberts The Temple had spoken of committing \\"revolutionary suicide\\" in prior instances, and members had previously drunk what Jones told them was poison at least once before, but the \\"Flavor Aid\\" drink they ingested at that time contained no poison.Layton, Deborah. (1998) Seductive Poison. Anchor, 1999. . Concurrently, four other members died in the Temple's headquarters in Georgetown. Four months later, Michael Prokes, one of the initial survivors, also committed suicide.\\"The Death of Michael Prokes\\" Solar Temple (1994–97) From 1994 to 1997, the Order of the Solar Temple's members began a series of mass suicides, which led to roughly 74 deaths. Farewell letters were left by members, stating that they believed their deaths would be an escape from the \\"hypocrisies and oppression of this world\\". Added to this they felt they were \\"moving on to Sirius\\". Records seized by the Quebec police showed that some members had personally donated over $1 million to the group's leader, Joseph Di Mambro. There was also another attempted mass suicide of the remaining members, which was thwarted in the late 1990s. All the suicide/murders and attempts occurred around the dates of the equinoxes and solstices, which likely held some relation to the beliefs of the group.THE SOLAR TEMPLE, Religious Tolerance.org, Retrieved 2007-10-13The Tragedy Of The Solar Temple Cult Stephen Dafoe & Templar History Magazine, 2002, Retrieved 2007-10-13Solar Temple: A cult gone wrong, CBC News, Retrieved 2007-10-13Katherine Ramsland, Death Journey, Crime Library, Retrieved 2007-10-13 Heaven's Gate (1997) From March 24 to 27, 1997, 39 followers of Heaven's Gate died in a mass suicide in Rancho Santa Fe, California, which borders San Diego to the north. These people believed, according to the teachings of their group, that through their suicides they were \\"exiting their human vessels\\" so that their souls could go on a journey aboard a spaceship they believed to be following comet Hale–Bopp.Jonathan Broder, Suicide in San Diego – Were cultists recruited on the Web?, Salon/March 28, 1997 Some male members of the group underwent voluntary castration in preparation for the genderless life they believed awaited them after the suicide.\\"Some members of suicide cult castrated\\", CNN, March 28, 1997, but how ever there mass suicide brought new members that reformed the religious group in 2010–present but know one knows where they are located at.

Diaries recovered from the victims' home, \\"Adam House\\", related they wanted a pure life as lived by Adam and Eve, freeing themselves from bondage to any religion and refused contact with any outsiders. After leaving Islam, they did not partake in Christian ceremonies and they even used to worship Kali sometimes, practically out of boundaries of any particular religion. Burari Deaths The Burari deaths, also \\"Burari case\\" and \\"Burari kand\\", refers to the deaths of eleven family members of the Chundawat family from Burari, India, in 2018. Ten family members were found hanged, while the oldest family member, the grandmother, was strangled. The bodies were found on 1 July 2018; in the early morning after the death. The police have ruled the deaths as mass suicide, with an angle of shared psychosis being investigated. =Disputed religiously motivated suicides= Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God (2000)  On March 17, 2000, 778 members of the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God died in Uganda.Cult in Uganda Poisoned Many, Police Say New York Times July 28, 2000 The theory that all of the members died in a mass suicide was changed to mass murder when decomposing bodies were discovered in pits with signs of strangulation while others had stab wounds.New Vision, \\"Kanungu Dead Poisoned\\", Matthias Mugisha, July 28, 2000.

The town was besieged and captured by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, in the summer of 1544. A fire in 1775 destroyed two-thirds of the town center. The château was owned by the Orléans family until the French Revolution, was a base for German troops during World War II, and currently houses the Municipal Museum.

Three- phase full-wave rectifier with six anodes. A mercury-arc valve or mercury- vapor rectifier or (UK) mercury-arc rectifierElectrical Year Book 1937, Emmott and Company, Manchester, England, pp 180-185Rissik, H., Mercury-Arc Current Converters, Pitman. 1941. is a type of electrical rectifier used for converting high-voltage or high-current alternating current (AC) into direct current (DC). It is a type of cold cathode gas-filled tube, but is unusual in that the cathode, instead of being solid, is made from a pool of liquid mercury and is therefore self-restoring. As a result, mercury-arc valves were much more rugged and long-lasting, and could carry much higher currents than most other types of gas discharge tube. Invented in 1902 by Peter Cooper Hewitt, mercury-arc rectifiers were used to provide power for industrial motors, electric railways, streetcars, and electric locomotives, as well as for radio transmitters and for high-voltage direct current (HVDC) power transmission. They were the primary method of high power rectification before the advent of semiconductor rectifiers, such as diodes, thyristors and gate turn-off thyristors (GTOs) in the 1970s. These solid state rectifiers have since completely replaced mercury-arc rectifiers thanks to their higher reliability, lower cost and maintenance and lower environmental risk.  History  One of the first mercury arc bulbs built by Cooper Hewitt In 1882 Jemin and Meneuvrier observed the rectifying properties of a mercury arc. The mercury arc rectifier was invented by Peter Cooper Hewitt in 1902 and further developed throughout the 1920s and 1930s by researchers in both Europe and North America. Before its invention, the only way to convert AC current provided by utilities to DC was by using expensive, inefficient, and high- maintenance rotary converters or motor–generator sets. Mercury-arc rectifiers or \\"converters\\" were used for charging storage batteries, arc lighting systems,I.C.S. Reference Library volume 4B, International Textbook Company, Scranton PA 1908, section 53, page 34. the DC traction motors for trolleybuses, trams, and subways, and electroplating equipment. The mercury rectifier was used well into the 1970s, when it was finally replaced by semiconductor rectifiers.  Operating principles  Glass-bulb mercury-arc rectifier from the 1940s Operation of the rectifier relies on an electrical arc discharge between electrodes in a sealed envelope containing mercury vapor at very low pressure. A pool of liquid mercury acts as a self-renewing cathode that does not deteriorate with time. The mercury emits electrons freely, whereas the carbon anodes emit very few electrons even when heated, so the current of electrons can only pass through the tube in one direction, from cathode to anode, which allows the tube to rectify alternating current. When an arc is formed, electrons are emitted from the surface of the pool, causing ionization of mercury vapor along the path towards the anodes. The mercury ions are attracted towards the cathode, and the resulting ionic bombardment of the pool maintains the temperature of the emission spot, so long as a current of a few amperes continues. While the current is carried by electrons, the positive ions returning to the cathode allow the conduction path to be largely unaffected by the space charge effects which limit the performance of vacuum tubes. Consequently, the valve can carry high currents at low arc voltages (typically 20–30 V) and so is an efficient rectifier. Hot-cathode, gas discharge tubes such as the thyratron may also achieve similar levels of efficiency but heated cathode filaments are delicate and have a short operating life when used at high current. The temperature of the envelope must be carefully controlled, since the behaviour of the arc is determined largely by the vapor pressure of the mercury, which in turn is set by the coolest spot on the enclosure wall. A typical design maintains temperature at and a mercury vapor pressure of 7 millipascals. The mercury ions emit light at characteristic wavelengths, the relative intensities of which are determined by the pressure of the vapor. At the low pressure within a rectifier, the light appears pale blue-violet and contains much ultraviolet light.  Construction  The construction of a mercury arc valve takes one of two basic forms — the glass-bulb type and the steel-tank type. Steel-tank valves were used for higher current ratings above approximately 500 A. = Glass-bulb valves = A glass-envelope mercury-arc rectifier valve The earliest type of mercury vapor electric rectifier consists of an evacuated glass bulb with a pool of liquid mercury sitting in the bottom as the cathode. Over it curves the glass bulb, which condenses the mercury that is evaporated as the device operates. The glass envelope has one or more arms with graphite rods as anodes. Their number depends on the application, with one anode usually provided per phase. The shape of the anode arms ensures that any mercury that condenses on the glass walls drains back into the main pool quickly to avoid providing a conductive path between the cathode and respective anode. Glass envelope rectifiers can handle hundreds of kilowatts of direct-current power in a single unit. A six-phase rectifier rated 150 amperes has a glass envelope approximately 600 mm (24 inches) high by 300 mm (12 inches) outside diameter. These rectifiers will contain several kilograms of liquid mercury. The large size of the envelope is required due to the low thermal conductivity of glass. Mercury vapor in the upper part of the envelope must dissipate heat through the glass envelope in order to condense and return to the cathode pool. Some glass tubes were immersed in an oil bath to better control the temperature. The current-carrying capacity of a glass-bulb rectifier is limited partly by the fragility of the glass envelope (the size of which increases with rated power) and partly by the size of the wires fused into the glass envelope for connection of the anodes and cathode. Development of high-current rectifiers required leadwire materials and glass with very similar coefficients of thermal expansion in order to prevent leakage of air into the envelope. Current ratings of up to 500 A had been achieved by the mid-1930s, but most rectifiers for current ratings above this were realised using the more robust steel-tank design. = Steel-tank valves = For larger valves, a steel tank with ceramic insulators for the electrodes is used, with a vacuum pump system to counteract slight leakage of air into the tank around imperfect seals. Steel-tank valves, with water cooling for the tank, were developed with current ratings of several thousand amps. Like glass-bulb valves, steel-tank mercury arc valves were built with only a single anode per tank (a type also known as the excitron) or with multiple anodes per tank. Multiple-anode valves were usually used for multi-phase rectifier circuits (with 2, 3, 6 or 12 anodes per tank) but in HVDC applications, multiple anodes were often simply connected in parallel in order to increase the current rating. = Starting (ignition) = A conventional mercury-arc rectifier is started by a brief high-voltage arc within the rectifier, between the cathode pool and a starting electrode. The starting electrode is brought into contact with the pool and allowed to pass current through an inductive circuit. The contact with the pool is then broken, resulting in a high emf and an arc discharge. The momentary contact between the starting electrode and the pool may be achieved by a number of methods, including: * allowing an external electromagnet to pull the electrode into contact with the pool; the electromagnet can also serve as the starting inductance, * arranging the electromagnet to tip the bulb of a small rectifier, just enough to allow mercury from the pool to reach the starting electrode, * providing a narrow neck of mercury between two pools, and by passing a very high current at negligible voltage through the neck, displacing the mercury by magnetostriction, thus opening the circuit, * Passing current into the mercury pool through a bimetallic strip, which warms up under the heating action of the current and bends in such a way as to break the contact with the pool. = Excitation = Since momentary interruptions or reductions of output current may cause the cathode spot to extinguish, many rectifiers incorporate an additional electrode to maintain an arc whenever the plant is in use. Typically, a two or three phase supply of a few amperes passes through small excitation anodes. A magnetically shunted transformer of a few hundred VA rating is commonly used to provide this supply. This excitation or keep-alive circuit was necessary for single-phase rectifiers such as the excitron and for mercury-arc rectifiers used in the high-voltage supply of radiotelegraphy transmitters, as current flow was regularly interrupted every time the Morse key was released. = Grid control = Both glass and metal envelope rectifiers may have control grids inserted between the anode and cathode. Installation of a control grid between the anode and the pool cathode allows control of the conduction of the valve, thereby giving control of the mean output voltage produced by the rectifier. Start of the current flow can be delayed past the point at which the arc would form in an uncontrolled valve. This allows the output voltage of a valve group to be adjusted by delaying the firing point, and allows controlled mercury-arc valves to form the active switching elements in an inverter converting direct current into alternating current. To maintain the valve in the non-conducting state, a negative bias of a few volts or tens of volts is applied to the grid. As a result, electrons emitted from the cathode are repelled away from the grid, back towards the cathode, and so are prevented from reaching the anode. With a small positive bias applied to the grid, electrons pass through the grid, towards the anode, and the process of establishing an arc discharge can commence. However, once the arc has been established, it cannot be stopped by grid action, because the positive mercury ions produced by ionisation are attracted to the negatively charged grid and effectively neutralise it. The only way of stopping conduction is to make the external circuit force the current to drop below a (low) critical current. Although grid-controlled mercury-arc valves bear a superficial resemblance to triode valves, mercury- arc valves cannot be used as amplifiers except at extremely low values of current, well below the critical current needed to maintain the arc. = Anode grading electrodes = Mercury arc valves of ASEA design, with four anode columns in parallel, in the HVDC Inter-Island scheme in New Zealand. Mercury- arc valves are prone to an effect called arc-back (or backfire), whereby the valve conducts in the reverse direction when the voltage across it is negative. Arc-backs can be damaging or destructive to the valve, as well as creating high short-circuit currents in the external circuit, and are more prevalent at higher voltages. One example of the problems caused by backfire occurred in 1960 subsequent to the electrification of the Glasgow North Suburban Railway where steam services had to be re-introduced after several mishaps. For many years this effect limited the practical operating voltage of mercury-arc valves to a few kilovolts. The solution was found to be to include grading electrodes between the anode and control grid, connected to an external resistor-capacitor divider circuit. Dr. Uno Lamm conducted pioneering work at ASEA in Sweden on this problem throughout the 1930s and 1940s, leading to the first truly practical mercury-arc valve for HVDC transmission, which was put into service on the 20 MW, 100 kV HVDC link from mainland Sweden to the island of Gotland in 1954. Uno Lamm’s work on high voltage mercury-arc valves led him to be known as the \\"Father of HVDC\\" power transmission and inspired the IEEE to dedicate an award named after him, for outstanding contributions in the field of HVDC. Mercury arc valves with grading electrodes of this type were developed up to voltage ratings of 150 kV. However, the tall porcelain column required to house the grading electrodes was more difficult to cool than the steel tank at cathode potential, so the usable current rating was limited to about 200-300 A per anode. Therefore, Mercury arc valves for HVDC were often constructed with four or six anode columns in parallel. The anode columns were always air-cooled, with the cathode tanks either water- cooled or air-cooled.  Circuits  Single-phase mercury-arc rectifiers were rarely used because the current dropped and the arc could be extinguished when the AC voltage changed polarity. The direct current produced by a single-phase rectifier thus contained a varying component (ripple) at twice the power supply frequency, which was undesirable in many applications for DC. The solution was to use two-, three-, or even six-phase AC power supplies so that the rectified current would maintain a more constant voltage level. Polyphase rectifiers also balanced the load on the supply system, which is desirable for reasons of system performance and economy. Most applications of mercury-arc valves for rectifiers used full-wave rectification with separate pairs of anodes for each phase. In full-wave rectification both halves of the AC waveform are utilised. The cathode is connected to the + side of the DC load, the other side being connected to the center tap of the transformer secondary winding, which always remains at zero potential with respect to ground or earth. For each AC phase, a wire from each end of that phase winding is connected to a separate anode \\"arm\\" on the mercury-arc rectifier. When the voltage at each anode becomes positive, it will begin to conduct through the mercury vapor from the cathode. As the anodes of each AC phase are fed from opposite ends of the centre tapped transformer winding, one will always be positive with respect to the center tap and both halves of the AC Waveform will cause current to flow in one direction only through the load. This rectification of the whole AC waveform is thus called full-wave rectification. With three-phase alternating current and full-wave rectification, six anodes were used to provide a smoother direct current. Three phase operation can improve the efficiency of the transformer as well as providing smoother DC current by enabling two anodes to conduct simultaneously. During operation, the arc transfers to the anodes at the highest positive potential (with respect to the cathode). In HVDC applications, a full-wave three-phase bridge rectifier or Graetz-bridge circuit was usually used, each valve accommodated in a single tank.  Applications  As solid-state metal rectifiers became available for low-voltage rectification in the 1920s, mercury arc tubes became limited to higher voltage and especially high-power applications. Mercury-arc valves were widely used until the 1960s for the conversion of alternating current into direct current for large industrial uses. Applications included power supply for streetcars, electric railways, and variable-voltage power supplies for large radio transmitters. Mercury-arc stations were used to provide DC power to legacy Edison-style DC power grids in urban centers until the 1950s. In the 1960s, solid-state silicon devices, first diodes and then thyristors, replaced all lower-power and lower voltage rectifier applications of mercury arc tubes. Several electric locomotives, including the New Haven EP5 and the Virginian EL-C, carried ignitrons on board to rectify incoming AC to traction motor DC. A 150-kilovolt, 1800 amp mercury-arc valve at Manitoba Hydro's Radisson converter station, August 2003 One of the last major uses of mercury arc valves was in HVDC power transmission, where they were used in many projects until the early 1970s, including the HVDC Inter-Island link between the North and South Islands of New Zealand and the HVDC Kingsnorth link from Kingsnorth power station to London.Calverley T.E., Gavrilovic, A., Last F.H., Mott C.W., The Kingsnorth-Beddington-Willesden DC Link, CIGRE session, Paris, 1968. However, starting about 1975, silicon devices have made mercury-arc rectifiers largely obsolete, even in HVDC applications. The largest ever mercury-arc rectifiers, built by English Electric, were rated at 150-kV, 1800 A and were used until 2004 at the Nelson River DC Transmission System high-voltage DC-power-transmission project. The valves for the Inter- Island and Kingsnorth projects used four anode columns in parallel, while those of the Nelson River project used six anode columns in parallel in order to obtain the necessary current rating.Cogle, T.C.J, The Nelson River Project - Manitoba Hydro exploits sub-arctic hydro power resources, Electrical Review, 23 November 1973. The Inter-Island link was the last HVDC transmission scheme in operation using mercury arc valves. It was formally decommissioned on 1 August 2012. The mercury arc valve converter stations of the New Zealand scheme were replaced by new thyristor converter stations. A similar mercury arc valve scheme, the HVDC Vancouver Island link was replaced by a three-phase AC link. Mercury arc valves remain in use in some South African mines and Kenya (at Mombasa Polytechnic - Electrical & Electronic department). Mercury arc valves were used extensively in DC power systems on London Underground,London Transport in 1955, p. 43, London Transport Executive, 1956 and two were still observed to be in operation in 2000 at the disused deep- level air-raid shelter at Belsize Park. After they were no longer needed as shelters, Belsize Park and several other deep shelters were used as secure storage, particularly for music and television archives. This led to the mercury-arc rectifier at the Goodge Street shelter featuring in an early episode of Doctor Who as an alien brain, cast for its \\"eerie glow\\".Antony Clayton, Subterranean City: Beneath the Streets of London, p. 146, Historical Publications, 2000 . Others Special types of single-phase mercury-arc rectifiers are the Ignitron and the . The Excitron is similar to other types of valve described above but depends critically on the existence of an excitation anode to maintain an arc discharge during the half-cycle when the valve is not conducting current. The Ignitron dispenses with excitation anodes by igniting the arc each time conduction is required to start. In this way, ignitrons also avoid the need for control grids. In 1919, the book \\"Cyclopedia of Telephony & Telegraphy Vol. 1\\"The Project Gutenberg EBook of Cyclopedia of Telephony & Telegraphy Vol. 1 described an amplifier for telephone signals that used a magnetic field to modulate an arc in a mercury rectifier tube. This was never commercially important. An experimental mercury arc amplifier for use on long distance telephone circuits. It was never commercially used after the development of the audion tube. Environmental hazard Mercury compounds are toxic, highly persistent in the environment, and present a danger to humans and the environment. The use of large quantities of mercury in fragile glass envelopes presents a hazard of potential release of mercury to the environment should the glass bulb be broken. Some HVDC converter stations have required extensive clean-up to eliminate traces of mercury emitted from the station over its service life. Steel tank rectifiers frequently required vacuum pumps, which continually emitted small amounts of mercury vapor.

This term is still used nowadays in the context of differential equations, where \\"solving an equation by quadrature\\" means expressing its solution in terms of integrals. Quadrature problems served as one of the main sources of problems in the development of calculus, and introduce important topics in mathematical analysis.  History  Antique method to find the geometric mean Mathematicians of ancient Greece, according to the Pythagorean doctrine, understood determination of area of a figure as the process of geometrically constructing a square having the same area (squaring), thus the name quadrature for this process. The Greek geometers were not always successful (see quadrature of the circle), but they did carry out quadratures of some figures whose sides were not simply line segments, such as the lunes of Hippocrates and the quadrature of the parabola. By Greek tradition, these constructions had to be performed using only a compass and straightedge. For a quadrature of a rectangle with the sides a and b it is necessary to construct a square with the side x =\\\\sqrt {ab} (the geometric mean of a and b). For this purpose it is possible to use the following: if one draws the circle with diameter made from joining line segments of lengths a and b, then the height (BH in the diagram) of the line segment drawn perpendicular to the diameter, from the point of their connection to the point where it crosses the circle, equals the geometric mean of a and b. A similar geometrical construction solves the problems of quadrature of a parallelogram and of a triangle. The area of a segment of a parabola is 4/3 that of the area of a certain inscribed triangle. Problems of quadrature for curvilinear figures are much more difficult. The quadrature of the circle with compass and straightedge was proved in the 19th century to be impossible. Nevertheless, for some figures (for example a lune of Hippocrates) a quadrature can be performed. The quadratures of the surface of a sphere and a parabola segment discovered by Archimedes became the highest achievement of analysis in antiquity. :* The area of the surface of a sphere is equal to four times the area of the circle formed by a great circle of this sphere. :* The area of a segment of a parabola determined by a straight line cutting it is 4/3 the area of a triangle inscribed in this segment. For the proof of these results, Archimedes used the method of exhaustion of Eudoxus. In medieval Europe, quadrature meant the calculation of area by any method. Most often the method of indivisibles was used; it was less rigorous than the geometric constructions of the Greeks, but it was simpler and more powerful. With its help, Galileo Galilei and Gilles de Roberval found the area of a cycloid arch, Grégoire de Saint-Vincent investigated the area under a hyperbola (Opus Geometricum, 1647), and Alphonse Antonio de Sarasa, de Saint-Vincent's pupil and commentator, noted the relation of this area to logarithms.Enrique A. Gonzales-Velasco (2011) Journey through Mathematics, § 2.4 Hyperbolic Logarithms, page 117 John Wallis algebrised this method; he wrote in his Arithmetica Infinitorum (1656) some series which are equivalent to what is now called the definite integral, and he calculated their values. Isaac Barrow and James Gregory made further progress: quadratures for some algebraic curves and spirals. Christiaan Huygens successfully performed a quadrature of the surface area of some solids of revolution. The quadrature of the hyperbola by Saint- Vincent and de Sarasa provided a new function, the natural logarithm, of critical importance. With the invention of integral calculus came a universal method for area calculation. In response, the term quadrature has become traditional, and instead the modern phrase finding the area is more commonly used for what is technically the computation of a univariate definite integral.

It is associated with scenarios in which the observer is in control of a high- speed vehicle or other mode of transportation, such as fighter pilots, race- car drivers and motorcyclists. In such cases, the observer may fixate so intently on the target that they steer in the direction of their gaze, which is often the ultimate cause of a collision. The term target fixation was originally used in World War II fighter-bomber pilot training to describe pilots flying into targets during a strafing or bombing run.  Cause and effect  Target fixation is caused by becoming focused on one thing that is usually distracting, dangerous, or rewarding. Focus can be caused by \\"anticipated success\\", such as when trying to arrive at a destination in a certain amount of time while driving. While experiencing target fixation, a person be very susceptible to dangerous situations due to lack of awareness of one's surroundings.  Avoidance  To avoid this phenomenon, one can be aware and in control of vision when in a panic mode or in a reward mode. A person should think about what they see and be aware of their environment before making any decisions.

The doctrine is generally construed with regards to legal notices published, either by posting them at a designated place in a courthouse, or publishing them in a newspaper designated for legal notices. Because both methods of publication are available to the general public (courthouses being open to all members of the general public, and newspapers readily available in public places such as libraries), the person to whom the notice is being issued (even if issued in a generic form, such as \\"To All Heirs of John Smith, a Resident of Orange County\\") is considered to have received notice even if they were not actually aware of it. Another use of constructive notice is in the recording of deeds, mortgages, liens, and similar documents in county registries in the United States. Since such documents are considered public information and can be accessed by any member of the public, such recordings are considered constructive notice of land conveyances or encumbrances having taken place. In companies law the doctrine of constructive notice is a doctrine where all persons dealing with a company are deemed (or \\"construed\\") to have knowledge of the company's articles of association and memorandum of association. The doctrine of indoor management is an exception to this rule. The New York City Housing Court allows use of the concept of constructive notice by either the tenant or the landlord. For example, constructive notice could be given to a landlord if a broken and unsupported metal grate on a public sidewalk collapses when stepped on by a pedestrian. The landlord is reasonably expected to know that this is a safety hazard. Indoor management The harshness of the doctrine of constructive notice is somewhat reduced by the \\"Rule of Indoor management\\" or \\"Turquand's Rule\\". The rule derives its name from the case of Royal British Bank v Turquand, where the defendant was the liquidator of the insolvent Cameron's Coalbrook Steam, Coal and Swansea and Loughor Railway Company. The company had borrowed from Royal British Bank by giving a bond worth £2,000. The articles of the company stated that the directors could only borrow if authorised by a resolution of the company's general meeting, and could not borrow more than the amount specified in the resolution. The articles were registered with Companies House so there was constructive notice. But the bank could not have known about the resolution, as they were not registrable and thus were not a public document. The bond was held valid and there was no requirement to know the company's internal workings.

He is one of two lead rappers in the hip hop group Cypress Hill, a part of the supergroup Serial Killers and was one of the frontmen of rap rock group Prophets of Rage (2016–2019). Early life and career Born in Los Angeles to a Mexican father and a Cuban mother, B-Real moved with his sister and mother out of his father's home to South Gate, California at the age of five. He later lived in Bell, California. Before dropping out of Bell High School, he befriended future Cypress Hill members Sen Dog and Mellow Man Ace (who later left the group to go solo) and became an active member of the Family Swan Bloods, known as the Neighborhood Family Bloods at that time. At the age of 17, Freese was shot in a gang-related shooting with a hollow-point .22 caliber bullet, which punctured his lung. After being introduced to DJ Muggs by Julio G the KDAY Mixmaster, B-Real and Sen gained interest in Muggs's concept of an album based on experiences from Cypress Ave in South Gate. The group was signed with Ruffhouse/Columbia records in 1991 and made their influential debut that year. B-Real would use fictional stories telling of life-threatening experiences as material for the group's self-titled debut album, and subsequent releases. Cypress Hill's trademark sound – an eccentric combination of B-Real's exaggeratedly high- pitched nasal vocals and DJ Muggs's distinctive beats – led to the trio becoming the first Latin rap group to have Platinum and multi-Platinum albums. They remain the best-selling Latin rap group to date.\\"Greatest Hits From the Bong Out\\" Speaking in March 2010 to noted UK urban writer Pete Lewis, Deputy Editor of the award-winning Blues & Soul, B-Real stated: \\"Fortunately I guess the fact we were able to achieve what we achieved, being Latino but without really exploiting that side of it, showed like a whole generation behind us how you could have that success without being labeled as just one THING. Because back in the day, when you were labeled 'a Latino rapper', the record companies would only try to market you to that Latin fan-base which didn't really EXIST yet!... So yeah, it feels good to see people recognizing us as some of the pioneers that opened the doors for a lotta these other Latino rappers to come through.\\" Aside from Cypress Hill, B-Real has been involved in several other musical projects. In 1996, he contributed to the soundtrack for the movie Space Jam. In 2002, he teamed up with Mellow Man Ace and Son Doobie for the short-lived Serial Rhyme Killas, which released one 12\\" single in 2002. The group recorded a full-length debut album, entitled Deluxe Rapture, but it was never released. B-Real formed a rap metal group, Kush, with Deftones guitarist Stephen Carpenter and Fear Factory members Christian Olde Wolbers and Raymond Herrera. According to B-Real, Kush is more aggressive than other bands in the genre. He was also previously a member of the group The Psycho Realm, and in 2007 announced that he would collaborate with Sick Jacken once again on a new album. He revealed in an interview that he plans on recording a \\"V.S.\\" album of Cypress member DJ Muggs.

Production work In addition to his career as an MC, B-Real has worked as a music producer for six years, with clients ranging from Proof of D12 to the WWE.

The primary component is an orange subgiant, while the secondary is a white dwarf. The two stars share a common motion through space and hence most likely form a binary star system. The brighter star should be easily visible without optical aid under dark skies in the southern hemisphere. In 2000, an extrasolar planet was confirmed to be orbiting the primary star in the system.  Star system  The primary component, Epsilon Reticuli A, is a subgiant star with a stellar classification of K2IV, indicating that the fusing of hydrogen in its core is coming to an end and it is in the process of expanding to a red giant. With an estimated mass of about 1.5 times the solar mass, it was probably an F0 star while in the main sequence. It has a radius of 3.18 times the solar radius, a luminosity of 6.2 the solar luminosity and an effective temperature of 4,961 K. As is typical of stars with giant planets, it has a high metallicity, with an iron abundance 82% larger than the Sun's. The secondary star, Epsilon Reticuli B, is known as a visual companion since 1930, and in 2006 was confirmed as a physical companion on the basis of its common proper motion. It was noted that its color indices are incompatible with a main sequence object, but are consistent with a white dwarf. This was confirmed in 2007 by spectroscopic observations, that showed the absorption spectrum typical of a hydrogen-rich white dwarf (spectral type DA). This star has a visual apparent magnitude of 12.5 and is located at a separation of 13 arcseconds, corresponding to a projected physical separation of 240 AU and an orbital period of more than 2,700 years. It is estimated that Epsilon Reticuli B has a mass of and a radius of . Originally, when it was in the main sequence, it probably had a spectral type of A5 and a mass of , and spent 1.3 billion years on this phase. From a measured effective temperature of 15,310 K, it has a cooling age (time spent as a white dwarf) of 200 million years, corresponding to a total age of 1.5 billion years. This age is inconsistent with the primary estimated age of 2.8 billion years, which suggests a smaller mass for the white dwarf or a larger mass for the primary.  Planetary system  The inner solar system superimposed behind the orbits of the planet Epsilon Reticuli b (and several others) On December 11, 2000, a team of astronomers announced the discovery of a planet Epsilon Reticuli b. With a minimum mass of 1.17 that of Jupiter, the planet moves around Epsilon Reticuli with an average separation of 1.16 AU. The eccentricity of the planet is extremely low (at 0.06), and it completes an orbit every 418 days (or 1.13 years). Stability analysis shows that the planet's Lagrangian points would be stable enough to host Earth-sized planets, though as yet no trojan planets have been detected in this system.

The site is on a hillside near the village of Cromdale, then in Inverness-shire and now in the Highland council area. The battlefield has been included in the Inventory of Historic Battlefields in Scotland and protected by Historic Scotland under the Scottish Historical Environment Policy of 2009. Background After their defeat at the Battle of Dunkeld in 1689, the Highland clans had returned to their homes in low spirits. Sir Ewen Cameron assumed control over the army's remnant. Sir Ewen and the other Jacobite chiefs complained to King James over the precarious state of his support in Scotland and the necessity of sending them aid. James was occupied with preparations for resisting a threatened invasion of Ireland. To aid his supporters in Scotland, James sent clothing, arms, ammunition and provisions. He also directed a few officers from Ireland to Lochaber, among whom was Major-General Thomas Buchan, whom James made commander-in-chief of the Jacobite forces in Scotland.An officer in the Army. \\"Memoirs of the Lord Viscount Dundee.\\" London: Robert Chapman 1818. p. 23 On Buchan's arrival, a meeting of the chiefs and principal officers was held at Keppoch to formulate a plan of action. While some of the clans proposed to submit to the government, this proposition was resisted by Sir Ewen. The meeting unanimously resolved to continue the war, but not until the labours of the spring season were complete in the Highlands. The general muster of the clans was postponed. In the meantime, a detachment of 1,200 infantrymen was to be placed at Buchan's disposal to weaken the enemy's quarters along the borders of the Lowlands. General Buchan advanced his men through Badenoch, intending to march down Speyside into the Duke of Gordon's country, where he expected to muster additional forces. Due to desertion, Buchan's force had dwindled to 800 men. Ignoring counsel from his Scottish officers not to advance past Culnakill, (the modern Coulnakyle near Nethybridge)“Coulnakyle” nethybridge.com. Retrieved 5 October 2019.“Coulnakyle” Galbraith.

Buchan marched down the Spey as far as Cromdale where he encamped on the last day of April. Battle He was met near Grantown-on-Spey at Cromdale by a larger government force under Sir Thomas Livingston, commander of the garrison of Inverness. As Livingston approached with his men, on the opposite bank of the Spey, the Jacobite forces started to retreat. Livingston's cavalry crossed the river and intercepted the Jacobites who made a brief stand at the foot of the hill of Cromdale. However, a thick fog came down the side of the mountain and enveloped the outnumbered Jacobites, compelling Livingston to discontinue the pursuit. According to reports, the Highlanders had 400 men killed and taken prisoner. Livingston's losses were reported as between none and 100 killed. A group of around 100 men, who had separated from the main Jacobite force, crossed the Spey the following day. After being pursued by some of Livingston's men, they were overtaken and dispersed on the moor of Granish near Aviemore, where some of them were killed. They attempted to seize the castle of Lochinclan, but their attack was repelled by the proprietor and his tenants. Aftermath The defeat at Cromdale effectively ended the rebellion in Scotland. Nevertheless, Jacobite propagandists declared the action a victory for the Jacobite forces, and composed a popular song, The Haughs of Cromdale, to promote that viewpoint. It is listed in James Hogg's Jacobite Reliques as song number 2. The last verse reads: The loyal Stuarts, with Montrose, So boldly set upon their foes, And brought them down with Highland blows Upon the Haughs of Cromdale. Of twenty-thousand Cromwell's men, a thousand fled to Aberdeen, The rest of them lie on the plain, They're on the Haughs of Cromdale. Of twenty-thousand of Cromwell's men, a-thousand fled to Aberdeen, The rest of them lie on the plain, They're on the Haughs of Cromdale. Strangely enough, the hero of the song, James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose, died forty years before the battle occurred. The tune has remained popular and is still played by pipe bands.

A dynasty belonging to this clan ruled over the kingdom of Mewar in Rajasthan. The name of the clan is also transliterated as Sesodia, Shishodia, Sishodia, Shishodya, Sisodya, Sisodia or Sisodiya.  Origins  The Sisodia dynasty traced its ancestry to Rahapa, a son of the 12th century Guhila king Ranasimha. The main branch of the Guhila dynasty ended with their defeat against the Khalji dynasty at the Siege of Chittorgarh (1303). In 1326, Rana Hammir who belonged to a cadet branch of that clan; however regained control of the region, re-established the dynasty, and also became the propounder of the Sisodia dynasty clan, a branch of the Guhila dynasty, to which every succeeding Maharana of Mewar belonged, the Sisodias reclaimed control of the former Guhila capital Chittor.The Rajputs of Rajputana: a glimpse of medieval Rajasthan by M. S. Naravane Sisodias, like many other Rajput clans, claim origin from the legendary Suryavansha or solar dynasty. Rajprashasti Mahakavyam, a 17th-century laudatory text commissioned by Mewar's ruler Rana Raj Singh, contains a partly mythical, partly legendary and partly historical genealogy of the Sisodias. The work was authored by Ranchhod Bhatt, a Telangana Brahmin whose family received regular gifts from the Sisodias. The genealogy traces the dynasty's origin to the rulers of Ayodhya, starting with Manu, who was succeeded by several emperors from the Ikshvaku dynasty, such as Rama. One ruler Vijaya left Ayodhya for \\"the south\\" as per a heavenly command (the exact place of his settlement is not mentioned). He was succeeded by 14 rulers whose names end in the suffix –aditya (\\"sun\\"). Grahaditya, the last of these, established a new dynasty called Grahaputra (that is, the Guhila dynasty). His eldest son Vashapa is said to have conquered Chitrakuta (modern Chittor) in the 8th century, and adopted the title Rawal, thanks to a boon from Shiva. Third son of Raj Singh I, Rana Bahadur Singh embraced Islam and became a founder of \\"Ethaar\\" Dynasty. However, scholars suggest that the ancestor glorifying traditions of the Mughals was the reason behind the Sisodias claiming ancestry from an ancient dynasty mentioned in Ramayana. Grahaditya and Vashapa (better known as Bappa Rawal) are both popular figures in the Rajasthani folklore. Their successors include people who are known to be historical figures. According to the Rajprashasti genealogy, one of these – Samar Singh – married Prithi, the sister of Prithviraj Chauhan. His grandson Rahapa adopted the title Rana (monarch). Rahapa's descendants spent some time at a place called Sisoda, and therefore, came to be known as \\"Sisodia\\". The Sisodia coat of arms after Udaipur city was built According to Persian text Maaser-al-Omra, the Sisodia Ranas of Udaipur originated from Noshizad, son of Noshirwan-i-Adil, the eldest daughter of Yazdegerd III.  History  The most notable Sisodia rulers were Rana Hamir (r. 1326-64), Rana Kumbha (r. 1433-68), Rana Sanga (r.1508–1528) and Rana Pratap (r. 1572-97). The Bhonsle clan, to which the Maratha empire's founder Shivaji belonged, also claimed descent from a branch of the royal Sisodia family. Similarly, Rana dynasty of Nepal also claimed descent from Ranas of Mewar.Greater Game: India's Race with Destiny and China by David Van Praagh According to the Sisodia chronicles, when the Delhi Sultan Alauddin Khalji attacked Chittorgarh in 1303, the Sisodia men performed saka (fighting to death), while their women committed jauhar (self- immolation in preference to becoming enemy captives). This was repeated twice: when Bahadur Shah of Gujarat besieged Chittorgarh in 1535, and when the Mughal emperor Akbar conquered it in 1567. Frequent skirmishes with the Mughals greatly reduced the Sisodia power and the size of their kingdom. The Sisodias ultimately accepted the Mughal suzerainty, and some even fought in the Mughal army. However, the art and literary works commissioned by the subsequent Sisodia rulers emphasised their pre-Mughal past. The Sisodias were the last Rajput dynasty to form an alliance with the Mughals, and unlike other Rajput clans, never intermarried with the Mughal imperial family. Women from other Rajput clans that had marital relations with the Mughals were disallowed from marrying with the Sisodias. The Sisodias cultivated an elite identity distinct from other Rajput clans through the poetic legends, eulogies and visual arts commissioned by them. James Tod, an officer of the British East India Company, relied on these works for his book Annals and Antiquities of Rajast'han, or the central and western Rajpoot states of India (1829-1832). His widely read work further helped spread the views of the Sisodias as a superior Rajput clan in colonial and post-colonial India.

His career has seen him competing in the SCCA Formula Ford competition from 1973-1976 in local as well as National events. In that time he had four podium finishes and won the 1974 New York Region Formula Ford class. After 19 years of reluctant retirement after a death defying accident at Lime Rock Park Labor Day 1976, interspersed with occasional go-karting events, Emil re-entered competition in 1995 in the Ferrari Challenge Series campaigning a Ferrari 348 Challenge for most of the 1995 and 1996 events in North America. In 1996 he compiled 3 wins and a second and third in five starts in that series. He debuted a Ford Mustang Cobra R in Motorola Cup competition in 1996 with teammate Nick Longhi and competed part-time with that car in the 1997 and 1998 seasons. Entered a full-time program with the same car in 2001 in Grand-Am Cup competition. He and Nick Longhi won their first major event in this series in November 2001 at the Daytona Finale and nearly won the GS II championship with it in 2002, losing that Championship chase by 7 points because of a DNF in the final race. He also competed in the Rolex GT Series in 2000 with Spencer Pumpelly in five races in which their best finish was sixth. Competed in several Rolex races in 2001, 2002 and 2003, and campaigned full-time in 2004 (Maserati) and 2005 (Porsche 911 GT3 Cup).

The Apophthegmata Patrum is a collection of the wisdom of some of the early desert monks and nuns, in print as Sayings of the Desert Fathers. The most well known was Anthony the Great, who moved to the desert in AD 270–271 and became known as both the father and founder of desert monasticism. By the time Anthony died in AD 356, thousands of monks and nuns had been drawn to living in the desert following Anthony's example—his biographer, Athanasius of Alexandria, wrote that \\"the desert had become a city.\\" The Desert Fathers had a major influence on the development of Christianity. The desert monastic communities that grew out of the informal gathering of hermit monks became the model for Christian monasticism. The eastern monastic tradition at Mount Athos and the western Rule of Saint Benedict both were strongly influenced by the traditions that began in the desert. All of the monastic revivals of the Middle Ages looked to the desert for inspiration and guidance. Much of Eastern Christian spirituality, including the Hesychast movement, had its roots in the practices of the Desert Fathers. Even religious renewals such as the German evangelicals and Pietists in Pennsylvania, the Devotio Moderna movement, and the Methodist Revival in England are seen by modern scholars as being influenced by the Desert Fathers. Early history Macarius and a Cherub\\" from Saint Catherine's Monastery, Sinai, Egypt Paul of Thebes is often credited with being the first hermit monk to go to the desert, but it was Anthony the Great who launched the movement that became the Desert Fathers. Sometime around AD 270, Anthony heard a Sunday sermon stating that perfection could be achieved by selling all of one's possessions, giving the proceeds to the poor, and following Christ (Matt. 19:21). He followed the advice and made the further step of moving deep into the desert to seek complete solitude. Anthony lived in a time of transition for Christianity—the Diocletianic Persecution in AD 303 was the last great formal persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire. Only ten years later, Christianity was made legal in Egypt by Diocletian's successor Constantine I. Those who left for the desert formed an alternate Christian society, at a time when it was no longer a risk to be a Christian. The solitude, austerity, and sacrifice of the desert was seen by Anthony as an alternative to martyrdom, which was formerly seen by many Christians as the highest form of sacrifice. Anthony quickly gained followers eager to live their lives in accordance with this solidarity and separation from material goods. From these prohibitions it is recorded by Athanasius that Anthony received special privileges from God, such as the ability to heal the sick, inspire others to have faith in healing through God, and even converse with God on occasion. Around this time, desert monasticism appeared nearly simultaneously in several areas, including Egypt and Syria. Over time, the model of Anthony and other hermits attracted many followers, who lived alone in the desert or in small groups. They chose a life of extreme asceticism, renouncing all the pleasures of the senses, rich food, baths, rest, and anything that made them comfortable. They instead focused their energies on praying, singing psalms, fasting, giving alms to the needy, and preserving love and harmony with one another while keeping their thoughts and desires for God alone. Thousands joined them in the desert, mostly men but also a handful of women. Religious seekers also began going to the desert seeking advice and counsel from the early Desert Fathers. By the time of Anthony's death, there were so many men and women living in the desert that it was described as \\"a city\\" by Anthony's biographer. The Desert Fathers advocated three main approaches to monasticism. One was the austere life of the hermit, as practiced by Anthony and his followers in lower Egypt. Another was the cenobitic life, communities of monks and nuns in upper Egypt formed by Pachomius. The third was a semi-hermitic lifestyle seen mostly in Nitria, Kellia and Scetis, west of the Nile, begun by Saint Amun. The latter were small groups (two to six) of monks and nuns with a common spiritual elder—these separate groups would join together in larger gatherings to worship on Saturdays and Sundays. This third form of monasticism was responsible for most of the sayings that were compiled as the Apophthegmata Patrum (Sayings of the Desert Fathers). Development of monastic communities Icon of Pachomius The small communities founded by the Desert Fathers were the beginning of Christian monasticism. Initially Anthony and others lived as hermits, sometimes forming groups of two or three. Small informal communities began developing, until the monk Pachomius, seeing the need for a more formal structure, established a monastery with rules and organization. His regulations included discipline, obedience, manual labour, silence, fasting, and long periods of prayer—some historians view the rules as being inspired by Pachomius' experiences as a Roman soldier. The first fully organized monastery with Pachomius included men and women living in separate quarters, up to three in a room. They supported themselves by weaving cloth and baskets, along with other tasks. Each new monk or nun had a three-year probationary period, concluding with admittance in full standing to the monastery. All property was held communally, meals were eaten together and in silence, twice a week they fasted, and they wore simple peasant clothing with a hood. Several times a day they came together for prayer and readings, and each person was expected to spend time alone meditating on the scriptures. Programs were created for educating those who came to the monastery unable to read. Pachomius also formalized the establishment of an abba (father) or amma (mother) in charge of the spiritual welfare of their monks and nuns, with the implication that those joining the monastery were also joining a new family. Members also formed smaller groups, with different tasks in the community and the responsibility of looking after each other's welfare. The new approach grew to the point that there were tens of thousands of monks and nuns in these organized communities within decades of Pachomius' death. One of the early pilgrims to the desert was Basil of Caesarea, who took the Rule of Pachomius into the eastern church. Basil expanded the idea of community by integrating the monks and nuns into the wider public community, with the monks and nuns under the authority of a bishop and serving the poor and needy. As more pilgrims began visiting the monks in the desert, influence from the monastic communities began spreading. Latin versions of the original Greek stories and sayings of the Desert Fathers, along with the earliest monastic rules coming out of the desert, guided the early monastic development in the Byzantine world and eventually in the western Christian world. John Cassian played an important role in mediating the influence of the Desert Fathers to the West. This can be seen, for example, in the Rule of Saint Benedict, where Benedict of Nursia urged his monks to read the writings of John Cassian on the Desert Fathers. The Sayings of the Desert Fathers was also widely read in the early Benedictine monasteries. Notable Desert Fathers and Mothers Icon of Arsenius the Great, notable Desert Father Many of the monks and nuns developed a reputation for holiness and wisdom, with the small communities following a particularly holy or wise elder, who was their spiritual father (abba) or mother (amma). The individual Desert Fathers and Desert Mothers are mostly known through The Sayings of the Desert Fathers, which included 1,202 sayings attributed to twenty-seven abbas and three ammas. The greatest number of sayings are attributed to Abba \\"Poemen\\", Greek for \\"shepherd\\". Because of the wide disparity of dates for the sayings attributed to Abba Poemen, some scholars believe that \\"Poemen\\" was a generic name for a combination of different unnamed Abbas. Others conclude that the sayings attributed to Abba Poemen are accurate, based on a notable and historical Abba Poemen. Among the notable Desert Fathers and Mothers with sayings in the book, in addition to Anthony the Great, were Arsenius the Great, Poemen, Macarius of Egypt, Moses the Black, and Syncletica of Alexandria. Other notable Desert Fathers include Pachomius and Shenouda the Archimandrite, and many individuals who spent part of their lives in the Egyptian desert, including Athanasius of Alexandria, John Chrysostom, Evagrius Ponticus, Hilarion and John Cassian. Cassian's works brought the wisdom of the Desert Fathers into a wider arena. PracticesWithdrawal from society= The legalization of Christianity by the Roman Empire in 313 gave Anthony a greater resolve to go out into the desert. Nostalgic for the tradition of martyrdom, he saw withdrawal and asceticism as an alternative. He insisted on selling all his material possessions—he left his younger sister a small amount of money to live her life in a convent, and donated the rest to the poor. When members of the church began finding ways to work with the Roman state, the Desert Fathers saw that as a compromise between \\"the things of God and the things of Caesar.\\" The monastic communities were essentially an alternate Christian society. The hermits doubted that religion and politics could ever produce a truly Christian society. For them, the only Christian society was spiritual and not mundane. =Hesychasm= Hesychasm (from the Greek for \\"stillness, rest, quiet, silence\\") is a mystical tradition and movement that originated with the Desert Fathers and was central to their practice of prayer. Hesychasm for the Desert Fathers was primarily the practice of \\"interior silence and continual prayer.\\" It did not become a formal movement of specific practices until the fourteenth century Byzantine meditative prayer techniques, when it was more closely identified with the Prayer of the Heart, or \\"Jesus Prayer\\". That prayer's origin is also traced back to the Desert Fathers—the Prayer of the Heart was found inscribed in the ruins of a cell from that period in the Egyptian desert. The earliest written reference to the practice of the Prayer of the Heart may be in a discourse collected in the Philokalia on Abba Philimon, a Desert Father. Hesychast prayer was a meditative practice that was traditionally done in silence and with eyes closed—\\"empty of mental pictures\\" and visual concepts, but with the intense consciousness of God's presence. The words hesychast and hesychia were frequently used in 4th and 5th century writings of Desert Fathers such as Macarius of Egypt, Evagrius Ponticus, and Gregory of Nyssa. The title hesychast was used in early times synonymously with hermit, as compared to a cenobite who lived in community. Hesychasm can refer to inner or outer stillness, though in The Sayings of the Desert Fathers it referred to inner tranquility. =Charity and forgiveness= The Desert Fathers gave a great deal of emphasis to living and practicing the teachings of Christ, much more than theoretical knowledge. Their efforts to live the commandments were not seen as being easy—many of the stories from that time recount the struggle to overcome negative emotions such as anger and judgment of others. Helping a brother monk who was ill or struggling was seen as taking priority over any other consideration. Hermits were frequently seen to break a long fast when hosting visitors, as hospitality and kindness were more important than keeping the ascetic practices that were so dominant in the Desert Fathers' lives. =Recitation of scripture= The lives of the Desert Fathers that were organized into communities included frequent recitation of the scriptures—during the week they chanted psalms while performing manual labour and during the weekends they held liturgies and group services. The monk's experience in the cell occurred in a variety of ways, including meditation on scripture. Group practices were more prominent in the organized communities formed by Pachomius. The purpose of these practices were explained by John Cassian, a Desert Father, who described the goal of psalmody (the outward recitation of scripture) and asceticism as the ascent to deep mystical prayer and mystical contemplation. Excerpts from The Sayings of the Desert Fathers *\\"A hermit said, 'Take care to be silent. Empty your mind. Attend to your meditation in the fear of God, whether you are resting or at work. If you do this, you will not fear the attacks of the demons.\\" *Abba Moses, \\"Sit in thy cell and thy cell will teach thee all.\\" *\\"Somebody asked Anthony, 'What shall I do in order to please God?' He replied, 'Do what I tell you, which is this: wherever you go, keep God in mind; whatever you do, follow the example of Holy Scripture; wherever you are, stay there and do not move away in a hurry. If you keep to these guide-lines, you will be saved.'\\" *\\"He (Evagrius) also said, 'A monk was told that his father had died. He said to the messenger, 'Do not blaspheme. My Father cannot die.'\\" *Abbot Pastor, \\"If someone does evil to you, you should do good to him, so that by your good work you may drive out his malice.\\" *An Elder, \\"A man who keeps death before his eyes will at all times overcome his cowardliness.\\" *Blessed Macarius said, \\"This is the truth, if a monk regards contempt as praise, poverty as riches, and hunger as a feast, he will never die.\\" *\\"It happened that as Abba Arsenius was sitting in his cell that he was harassed by demons. His servants, on their return, stood outside his cell and heard him praying to God in these words, 'O God, do not leave me. I have done nothing good in your sight, but according to your goodness, let me now make a beginning of good.'\\" * When one desert father told another of his plans to “ shut himself into his cell and refuse the face of men, that he might perfect himself,” the second monk replied, “ Unless thou first amend thy life going to and fro amongst men, thou shall not avail to amend it dwelling alone.” *\\"Abba Anthony said, 'Whoever hammers a lump of iron, first decides what he is going to make of it, a scythe, a sword, or an axe. Even so we ought to make up our minds what kind of virtue we want to forge or we labour in vain.' *He also said, 'Obedience with abstinence gives men power over wild beasts.'\\" *It was said of Abba John the Dwarf, that one day he said to his elder brother, 'I should like to be free of all care, like the angels, who do not work, but ceaselessly offer worship to God.' So he took off his cloak and went away into the desert. After a week he came back to his brother. When he knocked on the door, he heard his brother say, before he opened it 'Who are you?' He said, 'I am John, your brother.' But he replied, 'John has become an angel, and henceforth he is no longer among men.' Then the other begged him saying, 'It is I.' However, his brother did not let him in, but left him there in distress until morning. Then, opening the door, he said to him, 'You are a man and you must once again work in order to eat.' Then John made a prostration before him, saying, 'Forgive me.'\\" Essential texts There are many different collections of sayings of the Desert Fathers. The earliest writings were simply ordered by the initial letter of the Abba's name in the order of the Greek alphabet. So the editors started with Anthony the Great, Arsenius and Agathon and concluded with Cheremon, Psenthaisius and Or. It was those first editors who used the word apophthegms (meaning: saying, maxim or aphorism)—this is why this collection is now known as[Apophthegmata Patrum Alphabetica (The Sayings of the Desert Fathers: The Alphabetic Collection). This collection contains about a thousand items.The Apophthegmata Patrum: Portraits, William, S.J. Harmless (Contributor Webpage) https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/0195162234.001.0001/acprof-9780195162233-chapter-7 The same editors knew there were also a lot of anonymous sayings and tales of the Desert Fathers and Mothers circulating. This material was gathered into a collection now known as [Anonymous Patrum Apophthegmata (Anonymous Sayings of the Desert Fathers). These sayings were placed in order of more or less similar subjects (for instance: humility, charity etc.). This collection contains about eight hundred items. The collection now known as the Systematic Collection began to emerge a century later (AD 500). It has sayings from the Alphabetic Collection and the Anonymous Sayings, combined and systematically ordered under twenty-one chapters. This collection contains about 1200 items and therefore does not completely combine the two older collections. * The Sayings of the Desert Fathers (Apophthegmata Patrum) * The Lives of the Desert Fathers (Historia Monachorum in Aegypto) * Ethiopic Collectio Monastica, includes many sayings of the Desert Fathers not included in the Apophthegmata Patrum * The Lausiac History by Palladius of Galatia * The Life of Saint Antony by St. Athanasius * The Anonymous Sayings of the Desert Fathers (Anonymous Apophthegmata) * The Sayings of the Desert Fathers: The Systematic Collection * Philokalia collection of texts * The Conferences and The Institutes by John Cassian * The Evergetinos * Paradise of the Desert Fathers, also known as Bustan al-Rohbaan See also * Cappadocian Fathers * Christian monasticism before 451 * Christian contemplation § Theoria * Church Fathers * Coptic monasticism * Early Christianity * Eastern Christian monasticism ReferencesFootnotesBibliography= : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : Category:Asceticism Category:Christian orders Category:Christian religious occupations Category:Hesychasm Category:Egyptian hermits Category:Groups of Roman Catholic saints Category:Christian monasticism Category:Christian terminology ","title":"Desert Fathers"},{"id":"1618759","text":"Richard Morrow Groat (born November 4, 1930) is a former two-sport athlete (professional baseball and basketball) best known as a shortstop in Major League Baseball (MLB). He played for four National League (NL) teams (mainly the Pittsburgh Pirates and St. Louis Cardinals) and was named the league's Most Valuable Player in after winning the batting title with a .325 average for the World Champion Pirates. From 1956 to 1962, he teamed with second baseman Bill Mazeroski to give Pittsburgh one of the game's strongest keystone combinations. Groat led the NL in double plays a record five times, in putouts four times and in assists twice. At the end of his career he ranked ninth in major league history in games at shortstop (1,877) and fourth in double plays (1,237), and was among the NL career leaders in putouts (10th, 3,505), assists (8th, 5,811) and total chances (9th, 9,690). Also an excellent basketball player, Groat attended Duke University and is a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. He was twice an All-American at Duke and was voted as the Helms National Player of the Year in 1952 after averaging 25.2 points per game. He played one season as a guard in the National Basketball Association. In 2011 Groat was inducted into the National College Baseball Hall of Fame, becoming the first man ever inducted into both the college basketball and college baseball halls of fame. From 1969 to 2019 he was the color commentator for Pittsburgh Panthers men's basketball radio broadcasts. Baseball Groat was signed by Pirates general manager Branch Rickey just days after graduating from Duke, where he had been a two-time All-American in basketball and baseball. Both the St. Louis Cardinals and New York Giants were also interested in him, but he had always hoped to play for the Pirates after growing up a few miles away from Forbes Field. He broke in with the Pirates in June, never playing in the minor leagues, and batted .284 over the rest of the year. Afterwards, he pursued his basketball career before serving two years in the Army. He led Fort Belvoir teams to worldwide Army championships in both sports, the first time a single base had won both titles in the same year, hitting .362 in baseball and averaging 35 points per game in basketball. Returning to the Pirates in , he batted second for the team, with leadoff hitter Bill Virdon later recalling his particular skill at the hit and run. That year he led the NL in putouts for the first time; pitcher Roy Face has noted that Groat was always in the best position for the various hitters, although he didn't have great speed or a strong arm. In 1956, he set the all- time record for most at bats in a season (520) without a home run or stolen base. He batted .315 (fifth in the league) in , along with a career high of 7 home runs; on September 29 of that year against the Giants, he threw out the final batter to end the Giants last home game ever at the Polo Grounds.Land of the Giants / Stew Thornley  BaseballLibrary.com In he again hit .300, and led the NL in putouts and double plays as the Pirates finished in second place, the first time they had placed higher than seventh since 1949. He led the NL in putouts and double plays again in , and made his first of five All-Star teams. In the ensuing offseason he was nearly traded for Roger Maris, but the deal was cancelled by manager Danny Murtaugh. Groat responded with his best year as team captain, becoming the first Pirate to be named MVP since Paul Waner in their last pennant year of 1927, and also the first right-handed Pirates hitter to win the batting title since Honus Wagner in 1911. He missed a few weeks late in the season after having his wrist broken by a Lew Burdette pitch on September 6. In the 1960 World Series against the New York Yankees, he tied Game 1 at 1–1 with a first-inning double and scored to give Pittsburgh the lead; they stayed in front, winning 6–4, with Groat turning a double play to end the game. In Game 7, he had an RBI single and scored in the eighth inning, in which the Pirates scored five runs to take a 9–7 lead; the Pirates won the Series on Mazeroski's famed home run in the next inning. In Groat batted .275, and together with Mazeroski led the league in double plays. In he batted .294, finishing third in the league in doubles (34), and led the NL in putouts, assists and double plays. In November 1962, in the hope of bolstering the team's pitching, general manager Joe L. Brown traded him to the Cardinals in exchange for Don Cardwell. Groat was deeply hurt by the trade, having hoped to become a coach and eventually manager after retiring, and severed all contact with the team until a 1990 reunion of the 1960 champions. He had another outstanding year in , finishing fourth in the league with a .319 batting average - just seven points behind champion Tommy Davis - and collecting 201 hits. He also led the NL with 43 doubles, and was third with a personal high of 11 triples; he was the runner-up in the MVP voting, behind Sandy Koufax. In he batted .292 for the pennant-winning Cardinals, again leading the league in assists and double plays and making his last All-Star team. In the World Series against the Yankees, he reached base on Bobby Richardson's error in the sixth inning of Game 4, and scored on Ken Boyer's grand slam in the 4-3 St. Louis victory. Groat also tagged out Mickey Mantle in the third inning of that game on a pickoff play. He scored in the 3-run tenth inning of Game 5, a 5-2 win, and had an RBI groundout in the final 7-5 win in Game 7. After hitting .254 in 1965, he was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies in a six-player deal. He batted .265 for the 1966 Phillies, and his contract was sold to the Giants (now in San Francisco) in June ; he ended his career that season with a .156 average in 44 games. In a fourteen-season career, Groat compiled a .286 batting average with 2138 hits, 39 home runs, 829 runs, 707 runs batted in, 352 doubles and 14 stolen bases in 1929 games. Defensively, he finished his career with a .961 fielding percentage. =Other highlights= * 5-time All-Star (1959–60, 1962–64) * Led NL in singles (1954, 1960) * Appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated three times * Groat is one of 13 athletes that played in both the National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball. The thirteen are: Danny Ainge, Frank Baumholtz, Gene Conley, Chuck Connors, Dave DeBusschere, Johnny Gee, Groat, Steve Hamilton, Mark Hendrickson, Cotton Nash, Ron Reed, Dick Ricketts and Howie Schultz. Basketball Groat played college basketball for Duke University. He was twice (1951 and 1952) an All-American, and was named the Helms Foundation Player of the Year in 1951 and the UPI National Player of the Year in 1952 after setting an NCAA record with 839 points. On May 1 of that year, his #10 was the first jersey to be retired in the rafters of Cameron Indoor Stadium, and it remained the only jersey retired by the school until 1980. During the 1951–52 season, he scored 48 points against North Carolina, the most ever scored against the Tar Heels. After college, Groat was drafted with the 3rd overall pick in the 1952 NBA draft as a guard for the Fort Wayne Pistons of the National Basketball Association. He played only one season for 26 games with the number 5, and averaged 11.9 points, 3.3 rebounds and 2.7 assists with a .368 FG%. His basketball career was cut short by military service though; when his enlistment was up, he returned to the Pirates but not to the Pistons. Groat was inducted into the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame in 2007. Groat served as a radio color analyst for the Pittsburgh Panthers men's basketball games and was part of Pitt basketball broadcasts with partner Bill Hillgrove since 1979. He was not retained after the completion of the 2018–2019 season. Other In the Larry David HBO comedy series Curb Your Enthusiasm (S2.E5 \\"The Thong\\"), Rob Reiner convinces Larry to participate in a celebrity auction to benefit Groat's Syndrome (a fictional neurological disorder). Reiner describes it affecting \\"kids and adults who have a tough time controlling their hyperactivity. It's as if you were on five cups of coffee at all times.\\" Reiner claims it was named after the doctor who discovered it but Larry David's character speculates it was named for Dick Groat, who he assumes must have had the disease because, as Larry says, \\"he didn't field very well because he was excited all the time.\\" Dick Groat is the great uncle of the golfer Brooks Koepka, who won the 2017 and 2018 U.S. Open, and the 2018 and 2019 PGA Championship.

An alternative way of dealing the cards is to lay them out one by one, and put them immediately into if possible. The number of cards to be laid out range from just one card to how many cards the width of the table can allow (usually a second or third row is constructed in the process). With this alternative dealing method, game-play remains otherwise unchanged. While more practical, it also allows an element of surprise as the player does not know the next card to be dealt until all possible plays are exhausted. Concertina is identical to Accordion, but both matched cards are discarded, making for an easier game. One Handed Solitaire (Bathroom Solitaire) also uses different criteria for discarding, and with 1 in 140 chances of winning. Royal Marriage is another eliminator solitaire game in the style of Accordion, where the aim is to reduce the entire deck to King and Queen of the same suit, these being placed at the start and end of the layout at the beginning of the game. Strategy The odds of winning have been estimated as being around one in a hundred.\\"Accordion\\" (p.309) in Bicycle Official Rules of Card Games by Joli Quentin Kansil (ed.), 1999. \\"Accordion\\" (p.202) in Hoyle's Rules of Games (3rd edition) by Philip D. Morehead (ed.), 2001. Given how difficult it is to achieve this when cards are dealt one at a time, Alfred Sheinwold suggests in his book 101 Best Family Card Games () that it may be considered a win when there are five piles or fewer at the end of the game. The best chance of a successful game comes by identifying 4 cards with the same rank that are close and near the end of the layout at the start of the game, and to try to move these four \\"sweeper\\" cards together in a group towards the front of the layout, not covering them with other cards until the end of the game.

It was declared a Local Nature Reserve in 2004 by Stockton Borough Council. The geography of the site is that of a large hole with banked sides leading to a small pond at the bottom and is densely populated with mature trees. The River Tees is to the East of the wood. As the name suggests the site was a Victorian Whinstone quarry from the 1820s to 1850s. The pond is where the main mine shaft was located, and although the depth of the pond is not known it is believed to be no more than 10m deep. The pond is not connected to the River Tees due to the impermeable nature of Whinstone. It is now a popular destination for aspiring younger mountain bikers, with the natural terrain providing ample features to ride. Preston Park itself is currently going through re-development work, and is expected to re-open fully in Summer 2012.

Both the friary and Kilcrea Castle, located in ruin to the west, were built by Observant Franciscans in the mid 15th century under the invitation of Cormac Láidir MacCarthy, Lord of Muskerry, as protection from English troops. The friary was sacked by the English army a number of times in the late 1500s, during which it sustained considerable damage, but remained occupied by friars until the 1620s. MacCarthy was killed in battle in 1494 and is buried at the site. The site has remained in continuous use as a burial ground, and contains, among others, the remains Art Ó Laoghaire, who was the subject of an epic poem written by Eibhlín Dubh Ní Chonaill. The abbey's main features include an aisle, a transept on the south-side, and cloisters at the north end. The narrow tower is ascended via a series of steep and winding stairs. The areas around the tower were once dormitories, day rooms and kitchens. The name Kilcrea () is derived from the Irish Cill Chre (Cell of Cyra). St Créidh (anglicised as Saint Cyra) lived in the 6th century and is said to have founded a nunnery about a mile east of the friary, in the parish of St Owen's, today known as Ovens. History Tower and arches The abbey was founded in 1465 for the Observant Franciscans by Cormac Láidir MacCarthy, Lord of Muskerry, on the grounds of on an earlier Christian site. Located in the valley of the Bride river, it is named after the sixth-century holy lady Saint Cyra, said to have been the abbess of the original nunnery located on the site, and who by legend may be interred in the centre of the choir. Although both the abbey and nearby Kilcrea Castle are located in what is today open countryside, it is thought that originally the sites were positioned on an east–west axis of a now-abandoned early medieval settlement. Kilcrea was first attacked by the English army in 1542 and sacked in 1584, but continued in use under MacCarthy's patronage. In 1597, it was granted to Cormac MacDermot MacCarthy. It was twice repaired, including in 1604, and remained active until the 1620s, with Fr. John Gould recorded as Superior in 1621. Its grounds have been used for general burial since the early 17th century; mostly in the graveyard within the ruins of the abbey's chancel. It was the burial place of the McCarthy's of Muskerry from 1494 to 1616, commencing. with Cormac MacCarthy. However, there are no surviving traces of their tombs on the site. Cormac Láidir MacCarthy tomb bears the inscription: \\"Hit Jacet Cormac filius Derm-ittu Magni MlcCarthy, Domii nus de Illutsgraiyli IFlayn, at istius conventus prinius fun dator An. Dont. 1495\\". A head carved on the tower's upper floors is thought to represent him. Architecture and layout Kilcrea Friary, with tower in background Kilcrea Friary consists a series of buildings located around a main church or chapel. Although in ruins, the abbey is still relatively complete, including its tower, cloister and the surrounding east, west and north-facing buildings. The abbey's chapel contains a nave, chancel, transept and an L-shaped aisle. It is entered through a doorway in its west gable. An arcade separates the nave from the south aisle and transept. The chancel contains a large window on its east wall, which has lost its original intersecting tracery. The other four pointed windows are fixed on the south wall via segmental-headed embrasures, and contained either single or twined glass panes (lights). No trace survives of the high altar which was likely positioned under the east window, but an arched piscina is found nearby in the south wall. Adjoining the chancel is the sacristy which was added in the 16th century, above which is the scriptorium. Nave and tower in ruins The cloister area is located north of the church. The arcades are missing from the cloister, although the roofless two-story ranges are well preserved and mostly intact. The remains of the chapter room and refectory or possibly the kitchen (33 x 21 ft) are located on the east range, above which are the dormitories. There is evidence in some records that the friary once contained an infirmary, however the precise room has not been identified. The scriptorium measures 39 x 17 ft and probably also functioned as a study-room. As with all such rooms in medieval Irish friaries, it was the most well lite room on the site; the room in Kilcrea contains 11 tall two-light windows. A recess for a holy water stoup is located outside the doorway, and in the gable over the doorway are the remains of a large, three-light window. The tower contained four storeys with timber floors supported on stone corbels. Each storey was lit by plain, narrow, flat-headed windows. Except for the top storey where there is a single ogee-headed light in each wall. It is broader at its base in order to accommodate the stairways and passage to the tower. A 15th-century manuscript written at Kilcrea is preserved in Rennes, France.

The President of Finland is the Grand Master of all three orders. The orders are administered by boards consisting of a chancellor, a vice-chancellor and at least four members. The orders of the White Rose of Finland and the Lion of Finland have a joint board. The Order of the White Rose of Finland was established by Gustaf Mannerheim in his capacity as regent (temporary head of state) on January 28, 1919. The name comes from the nine roses argent in the coat of arms of Finland. The order's rules and regulations were confirmed on May 16, 1919, and its present rules date from June 1, 1940. The revised scale of ranks was confirmed most recently in 1985. The original decorations were designed by Akseli Gallen-Kallela. The swastikas of the collar were replaced by fir crosses in 1963, designed by heraldic artist Gustaf von Numers. The honour can be granted for military as well as civilian merit. The ribbon for all classes is ultramarine. The motto of the Order appears on the medallion and is Isänmaan hyväksi, which means in Finnish: \\"For [the well-being or benefit or advantage of] the Fatherland\\". The President of Finland wears the Grand Cross of the White Rose of Finland with Collar (a neck chain). The Collar is worn four centimetres from either side and hangs at equal distances at the front and back. The Grand Cross and Commander marks are awarded with a breast star.

BiographyEarly career= Valentine was born in North Shields, Northumberland, England, and was influenced by the 1950s skiffle craze. His mother bought him his first guitar in 1956 when he was 13, he taught himself some chords from a book called \\"Teach Yourself a Thousand Chords\\". He continued to develop his musical talent at John Spence Community High School and formed his own skiffle group called the Heppers. They played local gigs and a newspaper described them at the time as, \\"A young but promising skiffle group\\". The Heppers eventually evolved into a rock and roll band, the Wildcats in c. 1959. During this period Valentine played a Futurama III solid guitar, this was the UK brandname of importer Selmer, his next guitar was a Burns Vibra-Artiste which he bought in 1960–61. The Wildcats was a popular band in the Tyneside area getting a lot of bookings for dance halls, working men's clubs, church halls etc., and it was during this period that they decided to record a 10\\" acetate LP titled Sounds of the Wild Cats (sic). =The Animals= In 1963, the Animals were starting to form and Chas Chandler heard about Hilton Valentine's wild guitar playing and asked him to join what was then the Alan Price Combo. Eric Burdon was already a member and John Steel joined immediately following Valentine's arrival. Within a few months, this group changed their name to the Animals. While the Animals are often remembered most for Burdon's vocals and Price's organ, Valentine is credited with the electric guitar arpeggio introduction to the Animals' 1964 signature song \\"The House of the Rising Sun\\", which inspired countless beginning guitarists.T.J. McGrath, \\"Hilton Valentine: The Sun Also Rises\\" , Dirty Linen, June/July 2006. Accessed 4 May 2007.Barry York, \\"House of Worship\\", The Age, 9 July 2004. Accessed 4 May 2007. It was played on his Gretsch Tennessean guitar which he bought in Newcastle in early 1962 while he was still with the Wildcats, and a Selmer amplifier. Later, in 1964, Rickenbacker gave him a 1964 Rose Morris guitar to use along with a 12-string model. Valentine went on to play and record with the Animals, until the first incarnation of the band dissolved in September 1966. =Later career= Valentine subsequently moved to California and recorded a solo album entitled All In Your Head, which was not successful. The album was produced and arranged by later Animals member Vic Briggs. Valentine then returned to the UK, and over the years joined several Animals reunions. Along with Eric Burdon, Chas Chandler, Alan Price and John Steel, Valentine was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994. Along with the other Animals, Hilton was inducted into Hollywood's Rock Walk of Fame in May 2001. He released a new album, It's Folk 'n' Skiffle, Mate! in 2004. From that release until October 2009 he played throughout New England, New York and South Carolina, with his Skiffledog solo project. As well, from February 2007 to November 2008 Valentine toured with Eric Burdon. In early 2009 he released two basement demo recordings on his MySpace page. In 2011 Hilton Valentine released a new album titled Skiffledog on Coburg Street and a Christmas album with Big Boy Pete Miller ex-Peter Jay and the Jaywalkers titled Merry Skifflemas!.

It is situated at an altitude of 955m on a mountain slope near the Vikos gorge with roads linking it to Greek National Road 6. Vitsa is famous for its old double-arched bridge of Missios. History During ancient times, Zagori was inhabited by the Molossians. Excavations in the location Genitsari near Vitsa led to the discovery of a settlement possibly of the Tymphaeans or the Molossians dated to the 9th until the 4th century BC. There were signs of the foundations of small buildings from the archaic (geometric) and classical periods and a graveyard with at least 140 graves that contained coins, pottery and weaponry. The establishment of the village of Vitsa is referred to in other documents from 1321 to 1361, under the name of Vezitsa. Some buildings from Byzantine times are still preserved. The village is divided by a chasm in two districts that were once different villages called Ano Vitsa and Kato Vitsa (Upper and Lower Vitsa).A. Kathareios (Inspector of the 1st educational region of Epirus) Report of Inspection of Zagorochoria in 1913 These two villages were always considered, along with Monodendri, as more or less one village, due to their small distance. The Vikos gorge, near Vitsa After 1430, when the Ottomans conquered Ioannina, Vitsa and the rest of Zagori villages formed an autonomous federation, the Commons of the Zagorisians (). Further privileges were granted to the Commons of the Zagorisians due to the influence of Phanariot Zagorisians over the court of the Sultan, and were preserved until 1868. According to these privileges, Zagori was autonomous and self-governed under the surveillance of the Vekylis of Zagori. Another important privilege that the Zagorians had was the freedom to practice their Christian faith. The absence of direct Ottoman rule helped the inhabitants attain a good standard of living. The main source of income in the 18th and 19th centuries was from remittances from expatriates, as elsewhere in Zagori. Vitsa became a cultural center for the Zagori region and was the birthplace of people such as the Sarros family (among them politicians and engineers involved at the Suez Canal works in the 19th century) and Nikolaidis (man of literature). Since the 17th century and until World War II, (when Zagorisian traditional emigration ended), most people from Vitsa would emigrate to Egypt, Asia Minor and the United States. Inside geographical Greece, they mostly emigrated to Macedonia.  Buildings  In addition to the double arched bridge of Missios (built in 1748 AD), there is the church of Agios Georgios or of the Taxiarches from 1607 AD, the church of Agios Nikolaos (1612 AD, with well preserved frescoes), the church of the Dormition of the Virgin (Κοιμήσεως της Θεοτόκου) from 1554 (repaired in 1720-1728) in Lower Vitsa, the manors of Belogiannis, Vasdekis and Skevis and the Vrizopouleios School. The church of the Stavropegiac Monastery of Prophetes Elias (1632) survives in the north of Vitsa. It was founded upon an older foundation of a small 14th-century church of the Transfiguration of Christ.  Folklore  Vitsa celebrates the Feast of the Dormition of the Virgin (15 August).

The easternmost auxiliary route of I-10, it is also known as the Reubin O'Donovan Askew Parkway in honor of the former governor of Florida who originated in Pensacola. Route description I-110 consists of six interchanges. Unlike most Florida interstates, it retained its sequential exit numbering system when others switched to a mile-log system. The freeway begins at exits 1A through 1C, composing a directional T interchange that connects I-110 to Gregory Street, Chase Street (US 98), and Garden Street (US 98 Business) adjacent to the Pensacola Bay Center. Exit 2, north, links I-110 to Cervantes Street (US 90/98) via a southbound exit and northbound entrance. Exit 3, one further mile north, consists of a southbound exit and northbound entrance to and from Maxwell and Jordan Streets.

Approximately north is exit 5, an interchange with Brent Lane (SR 296) and Airport Boulevard (SR 750). Interstate 110's northern terminus is at Interstate 10. There is a modified trumpet/semi-directional T interchange at this location with additional direct connections to SR 291. History I-110 was completed between I-10 and SR 295/Fairfield Drive by 1965. An extension south to Maxwell Street was completed in 1969. In 1978, I-110 was further extended south to its current terminus in Downtown Pensacola. The original freeway was four lanes for its entirety and connected to I-10 via an unmodified trumpet interchange. Interstate 110 shield near Downtown Pensacola Between 2004 and 2009, I-110 was rebuilt and expanded to a minimum of six lanes between I-10 and Maxwell Street. Reconstruction of the freeway included access to and from Airport Boulevard via a modification of the existing Brent Lane interchange. The interchange with I-10 was rebuilt to include new flyover ramps to I-10 eastbound and from I-10 westbound, as well as direct connections to and from SR 291. Originally, north of SR 750/Airport Boulevard, there was an overpass for SR 742 along Burgess Road. In 2006, SR 742 was rerouted along a new, wider overpass at Creighton Road, and the Burgess Road overpass was demolished.

History  The collaboration between Motörhead and Girlschool started in March 1979, when Motörhead began their first big tour with Overkill and Girlschool were their opening act. Lemmy had heard Girlschool's single \\"Take It All Away\\" and thought they were \\"fucking excellent\\" and liked the idea of girls being in a band. In his opinion, Kelly Johnson was as good as any guitarist that he had ever seen in his life and \\"wanted to stick it up these pompous bastard guitarists' arses\\". In late December 1980, Motörhead's drummer, Phil Taylor, broke his neck, preventing his continuing to play, so Motörhead's producer, Vic Maile, suggested they record a single with Girlschool. Lemmy chose \\"Please Don't Touch\\" by one of his favourite groups of the past, Johnny Kidd & the Pirates. For the flipside, the bands recorded each other's songs — Girlschool performed \\"Bomber\\" and Motörhead performed \\"Emergency\\", although Denise Dufort played drums throughout.Kilmister, Ian and Garza, Janiss White Line Fever (2002) — Simon & Schuster pp. 126,143-144 . The record was released on 14 February 1981, as St. Valentine's Day Massacre EP and reaching No. 5 in the UK Singles Chart, it became the biggest hit either band ever had in the charts. On 6 February 1981 the bands had been filmed in concert for a Nottingham TV show called Rockstage and on 19 February 1981, billed as \\"Headgirl\\", they appeared on Top of the Pops playing \\"Please Don't Touch\\".Burridge, Alan Illustrated Collector's Guide to Motörhead Published: 1995, Collector's Guide Publishing . With Girlschool as special guests on the Motörhead 2005 Inferno UK Tour, Lemmy joined the band at the end of their set at Brixton Academy on 19 November to play \\"Please Don't Touch\\" for the first time ever live. In 1981 a Japanese 12\\" single was released on the Bronze/Victor label, based on \\"Please Don't Touch\\" under the name Motorschool. Issued in a picture sleeve, it included \\"Bomber\\" played by Girlschool, \\"Emergency\\" and \\"Bomber\\" played by Motörhead, and \\"Emergency\\" and \\"Yeah Right\\" played by Girlschool. Lyrics to the songs were printed in English and Japanese. Bronze used the Headgirl collaboration again in 1981, this time for a 12\\" vinyl release in the Netherlands called Hard Rock On 12 — the record plays \\"Please Don't Touch\\", \\"Stay Clean\\", \\"Metropolis\\" and \\"Demolition Boys\\" but listed entirely different tracks on the sleeve. Kelly Johnson, formerly of Girlschool and also guitarist with Headgirl, died on 15 July 2007, aged 49, after suffering from cancer of the spine for six years.

It runs in a north–south direction as a spur of I-10 in the city of Baton Rouge. The route branches off of I-10 just east of the Horace Wilkinson Bridge across the Mississippi River and travels along an elevated alignment between the city's downtown area and Mid City neighborhood. The interstate then makes two ° turns, the first occurring in front of the Governor's Mansion a few blocks east of the State Capitol. In the northern portion of the city, I-110 engages in a stack interchange with the concurrent U.S. Highways 61 and 190 (Airline Highway) and passes just west of the Baton Rouge Metropolitan Airport. The highway terminates as traffic merges onto US 61 (Scenic Highway) in an area known as Scotlandville. I-110 began as a short section of independent freeway near the downtown area originally known as the Baton Rouge Expressway. It opened to traffic in 1957 and served as part of US 61/190 Bus. until 1960. At this time, the route was incorporated into the Interstate Highway System as I-410 and was intended as part of a northern bypass of I-10 utilizing the existing Mississippi River Bridge on US 190\\\\. This project was cancelled in the mid-1960s, and the highway was instead utilized as a spur and renumbered as I-110. The highway was then extended northward in stages until its completion near Southern University in 1984. In 1999, the Louisiana legislature designated I-110 as the Martin Luther King Jr. Expressway. Route description From the south, I-110 begins at a three leg directional interchange with I-10 at exit 155B. I-10 branches west from this junction across the Mississippi River via the Horace Wilkinson Bridge and southeast toward the city of New Orleans. I-110 heads north as an elevated six-lane freeway, dividing the downtown and Mid City areas of Baton Rouge. A number of closely spaced and overlapping interchanges provide access to surface streets below, including: exit 1A to LA 73 (Government Street); 1B to Convention Street; 1C to US 61/190 Bus. (Florida Street); 1D to North Street; and 1H to Laurel Street. Most of the above are left exits favoring northbound traffic. I-110 briefly passes through the Spanish Town neighborhood as it descends to grade and bends sharply due east in front of the Governor's Mansion. Here, exit 1E connects with LA 3045 (Capitol Access Road), leading to the State Capitol, Capitol Park, Old Arsenal Museum, and Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development headquarters. The highway then passes the BREC Memorial Sports Complex, accessed via exit 1F to Fuqua Street, and has partial interchanges with Scenic Highway (2A) and LA 67/North 22nd Street (2B). After curving back to the north, I-110 elevates again and travels for through a residential neighborhood located just east of a large industrial area. Tight diamond interchanges during this stretch provide access to Chippewa Street (exit 3A), Mohican Street and Wyandotte Street/Weller Avenue (3B), Evangeline Street (4), and Hollywood Street (5A). Interchange marking the northern terminus of I-110 I-110 then engages into a stack interchange (exit 5B) with the concurrent US 61/US 190 (Airline Highway), which sweeps around the northeast side of town and crosses the Mississippi River en route to Opelousas. Immediately to the north, exit 6 to LA 408 (Harding Boulevard) provides access to Baton Rouge Metropolitan Airport and Southern University. Curving westward, I-110 skirts the Scotlandville area and has a half diamond interchange with LA 19 at exit 8A, connecting with the nearby suburb of Baker. Soon afterward, I-110 reaches its northern terminus at a junction with US 61 (Scenic Highway), which heads north toward St. Francisville and Natchez, Mississippi. =Route classification and data= I-110 is classified as an urban interstate by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD). Daily traffic volume in 2013 peaked at 85,500 vehicles at the I-10 interchange and tapered off to 25,300 vehicles toward the northern terminus. The posted speed limit is through the downtown area, after which it increases to for the remainder of the route. The portion of I-110 north of the Capitol Access Road exit is a small part of the ten-state National Scenic Byway known as the Great River Road. HistoryBaton Rouge Expressway= The genesis of the present I-110 was a short stretch of freeway constructed in the mid-1950s called the Baton Rouge Expressway. The first section extended roughly between Boyd Avenue (now Spanish Town Road) and Plank Road. Traffic was fed onto the expressway from the downtown area via the one-way couplet of North 9th and 10th Streets, a continuation of the divided thoroughfare of East Boulevard. The expressway was not initially constructed as part of the Interstate Highway System, although the Louisiana Department of Highways designed it for future inclusion. It was given the internal designation of LA 3022 and also served as part of US 61/190 Bus. from its opening on August 20, 1957 until 1960. =Interstate 410= In 1960, US 61/190 Bus. was moved onto its present route, and the Baton Rouge Expressway became part of the newly designated I-410. By 1963, the expressway was extended south to Government Street. The connections to I-10 were made when the adjoining sections of that highway were completed eastbound to Perkins Road in September 1964 and westbound across the Mississippi River in April 1968. I-410 was intended as a northern beltway extending from I-10 west of Port Allen, crossing the Mississippi River via the existing Huey P. Long Bridge on US 190, and then traveling along the present route of I-110 southward to rejoin I-10. This plan was scrapped around 1965, and the Baton Rouge Expressway was renumbered as I-110 to reflect its function as a north–south spur. =Renumbering and extensions= Further northern extensions of I-110 were opened as follows: from LA 67 (Plank Road) to Hollywood Drive around 1969, to US 61/190 (Airline Highway) in 1976, to LA 408 (Harding Boulevard) in the late 1970s, and to LA 19 around 1982. The final segment between LA 19 and US 61 (Scenic Highway) in Scotlandville was completed in January 1984. In total, I-110 was constructed over the course of 30 years at a cost of $94.8 million. =Naming controversy= In 1991, three separate parties advocated for the naming of a Baton Rouge-area thoroughfare after civil rights activist, Martin Luther King Jr. The most high-profile effort was by state Senator Cleo Fields, who stated that the city was the only major metropolitan area in Louisiana without a street named for King. Fields chose the northern portion of I-110 traversing the historically black community of Scotlandville for the designation. The other parties, which included the local NAACP and a group known as People for a Change, criticized Fields' choice of thoroughfare and also bickered amongst themselves about the issue. The proposal also met with strong opposition from the outside, including Louisiana House of Representatives member and then- gubernatorial candidate David Duke, who opposed naming any street for King, stating that his \\"reputation as a womanizer means the honor is an insult to women and family life.\\" Representatives from the Taxpayer Education Association of Louisiana, the Louisiana Coalition for Conservatism, and the National Association for the Advancement of White People likewise brought up allegations of widespread plagiarism in King's writings and his ties to Communism. Nevertheless, the bill was signed into law that year by Governor Buddy Roemer, designating I-110 as the Martin Luther King Jr. Expressway. Signs bearing the name were not installed along the highway until June 1999.

He is the father of Ashot II (known as Ashot Yerkat) and Abas I. Rule Smbat I was crowned king in 892 in Shirakavan (Yerazgavors), following a brief attempt by his uncle Abas to disrupt his succession to the throne. Smbat continued his father's policy of maintaining cordial relations with the Byzantine Empire but remained mindful of the Arabs' fears of the Armeno-Byzantine alliance. Speaking with the Arab ostikan (governor) Muhammad Ibn Abi'l-Saj (Afshin), Smbat convinced him that the alliance would not only be for the dual benefit of Byzantium and Armenia but would also work to the economic favor of the Arabs.Yovhannes Drasxanakertc'i (1987), History of Armenia, trans. Krikor Maksoudian. Atlanta, GA: Scholar's Press, p. 138. Smbat also achieved a major victory when on April 21, 892, he recaptured the former Armenian capital of Dvin from the Arabs. In some of these endeavors Smbat received strong support from his neighbor to the north, Adarnase IV of Iberia.Suny, Ronald Grigor (1994). The Making of the Georgian Nation, 2nd ed. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, pp. 30-31. Smbat's successes shortly came to a halt when Afshin decided that he could not countenance a powerful Armenia so close to his domains. He retook Dvin and managed to take Smbat's wife as a hostage until she was released in exchange for Smbat's son and nephew. The wars against Armenia continued even after Afshin's death in 901, when his brother Yusuf Ibn Abi'l-Saj became ostikan of Arminiya.Madelung, Wilfred (1975). \\"The Minor Dynasties of Northern Iran,\\" in The Cambridge History of Iran, ed. Richard N. Frye. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, vol. 4, pp. 227ff. While Yusuf's reign was not immediately hostile, Smbat committed a series of blunders that led to several of his allies to turn their backs on him: having sought to placate his eastern ally, Smbat of Syunik', by ceding to him Nakhichevan city, Smbat inadvertently drove Gagik Artsruni of Vaspurakan into Yusuf's arms since the city was a part of Gagik's domains. Yusuf took advantage of this feud by awarding Gagik a crown in 908, thus making him King Gagik I of Vaspurakan and creating an Armenian state opposed to the one led by Smbat. Arakelyan, Babken N.

Tsatur Aghayan et al. Yerevan: Armenian Academy of Sciences, vol. 3, pp. 36-67. As Yusuf began a new campaign against Smbat in conjunction with Gagik in 909, neither the Byzantines nor the Abbasid caliph, Yusuf's nominal sovereign, sent aid to Smbat; several Armenian princes also chose to withhold their support. Those who did ally with Smbat were brutally dealt with by Yusuf: Smbat's son Mushegh, his nephew Smbat Bagratuni, and Grigor II of Western Syunik were all poisoned.Garsoïan, Nina G.

Yusuf, however, showed no compassion toward his prisoner as he brought him to Yernjak, tortured the Armenian king to death, beheaded him, and put the headless body on display on a cross in Dvin.

From the north, the primary through lanes of I-210 become the unsigned northern stub of unfinished I-710, while from the east, the through lanes of the Ventura Freeway become I-210 as the Ventura Freeway reaches its official eastern terminus. After intersecting the northern terminus of I-605 (the San Gabriel River Freeway), I-210 then continues east to the Orange Freeway (SR 57) in Glendora. Heading east from the Orange Freeway interchange, until its eastern terminus at I-10 in Redlands, Route 210 is currently signed as a state route. Metro Gold Line, Sierra Madre Villa Station Portions of the Metro L Line of the LACMTA runs in the median of the Foothill Freeway from Pasadena to Arcadia, serving three stations: * Lake Avenue * Allen Avenue * Sierra Madre Villa Monrovia SR 210 presently has two distinct segments: * The western freeway segment serves as the easternmost portion of the Foothill Freeway (I-210). Consisting of newer freeway, beginning at the east end of I-210 near San Dimas, SR 210 extends eastward, eventually paralleling Highland Avenue, as it continues through Fontana. It intersects I-15, an artery between Southern California and Nevada, about before it meets with I-215 in San Bernardino. * The segment east of I-215 is the former alignment of SR 30\\\\. This segment extends eastward to junctions with I-215, SR 259, SR 18 and SR 330 in Highland. SR 210 then curves southward and ends in a junction with I-10 in Redlands. I-210 in La Cañada Flintridge; Jet Propulsion Laboratory on the right Route 210 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. Route 210 is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System, but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation (CalTrans). Route 210 from Route 5 to Route 10 in Redlands is known as the Foothill Freeway, as named by Senate Concurrent Resolution 29, Chapter 128 in 1991. =Glendora Curve= The Glendora Curve is the former colloquial name for the interchange between SR 57 and the Foothill Freeway, I-210.City Minutes referencing colloquial name. The \\"curve\\" portion refers to the interchange from the northbound lanes of SR 57 to the westbound lanes of I-210, and from the eastbound lanes of I-210 to the southbound lanes of SR 57\\\\. The origin of the name comes from its location in the city of Glendora. Prior to 2002, this interchange was entirely part of I-210, and the eastern terminus of I-210 ended several miles south of the curve at the Kellogg Interchange at the junctions of the Chino Valley Freeway, SR 71, the San Bernardino Freeway, I-10, and SR 57\\\\. After the portion of I-210 south of the Glendora Curve was transferred to SR 57 in 2002, effectively extending Route 210 east past the Glendora Curve, the name Glendora Curve fell out of popular use.Glendora Interchange HistoryThe 210= Pomona. Construction began on the freeway in 1958. The first section, starting at the eastern end of Foothill Boulevard in what is now La Cañada Flintridge, and going across the Arroyo Seco near Devil's Gate Dam to Canada Avenue in Pasadena, was opened in 1966; it was then signed as SR 118\\\\. The section going northwest from Pasadena through La Canada Flintridge to the junction with I-5 in Sylmar was built in several stages between 1971 and 1977. The first section to open was between Ocean View Boulevard and Lowell Avenue in La Crescenta, in July 1972, followed in November by the section between Berkshire Avenue and Ocean View in La Cañada Flintridge. The section of freeway in Sylmar, California that was intended to open first (between Interstate 5 and Maclay Avenue) was damaged by the 1971 Sylmar Earthquake, and the opening was delayed until repairs could be completed in 1973. In the Pasadena, California section, a bridge span traversing the Arroyo Seco collapsed during construction on October 17, 1972, killing six workers, and as a result, the northbound section through Pasadena was not fully opened until 1974. The last section in the San Fernando Valley to be completed was between Highway 118 in Lake View Terrace, and Lowell Avenue in La Crescenta. While this section was largely completed by 1976, the portion between Sunland Boulevard and Wheatland Avenue (traversing the Tujunga Wash) was not fully completed until 1981. From 1976 to 1980, the uncompleted section of Interstate 210 (notably near the interchange with Highway 118, near the Paxton Street exit) was rented by Columbia Pictures Television for the filming of the television series, CHiPs. In 1968, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway depot at Santa Anita, a historic structure built in 1890, was moved to the Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden to make way for a section of the freeway passing through Arcadia. Construction of the freeway through Pasadena and Arcadia prompted the realignment and relocation of the railroad's mainline to the freeway's median, with the former mainline trackage between Sierra Bonita and Kinneloa avenues in Pasadena becoming an industrial spur accessed via an underpass below the freeway's eastbound lanes. The \\"Pasadena\\" section from SR 134 to Rosemead Boulevard was completed in 1976, while the section from Arcadia, California to the Kellogg Interchange with I-10 at Pomona had been previously completed in 1971. The section between the Kellogg Interchange and Glendora is no longer part of I-210. In 2003, this piece was renumbered as part of SR 57, known as the Orange Freeway. In the 1990s, Caltrans began constructing extensions to the freeway from Glendora east to the former I-215/SR 30 interchange in San Bernardino. In 2003, a segment east from Glendora to Fontana was completed, with the portion proceeding south from Glendora renumbered SR 57\\\\. The remaining section east of I-15 between Fontana and I-215 was opened on July 24, 2007. Caltrans has petitioned the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), the trade organization that oversees the designation and naming of the Interstate Highway System, to re-sign the entire Foothill Freeway, including the entire segments of SR 210 and SR 30, as I-210. Upon completion of the new freeway segment west of I-215, SR 30 from I-215 to I-10 in Redlands was re-signed as SR 210\\\\. The re-signing in 2003 of the former portion of I-210 now signed as SR 57 truncated I-210 from its parent route, I-10. Presuming that authority is given at some point in the future to re-sign the entirety of Route 210 as an Interstate, I-210 will once again connect to its parent route, but much farther east in Redlands. The western freeway segment, planned since the 1970s and completed in 2002, replaced a western surface street segment that began with Base Line Road (sometimes spelled Baseline Road) at its intersection with Foothill Boulevard in La Verne and extended eastward into Upland. In Upland it became 16th Street, then turned northward onto Mountain Avenue, then turned eastward onto 19th Street. It left Upland and continued eastward into Rancho Cucamonga. After Haven Avenue in Rancho Cucamonga, 19th Street curves north, and becomes Highland Avenue, which still exists in some areas although in pieces due to the freeway overlapping onto Highland Avenue, such as the eastbound on and off ramps for Milliken Avenue. Highland Avenue deviates from the original SR 30 alignment at Etiwanda Avenue when it curves south and ends at East Avenue, the border of Rancho Cucamonga and Fontana. Highland Avenue starts again at Cherry Avenue, east of the I-15 and continues east, becoming W. Easton Avenue at Alder Avenue. Shortly afterwards, it makes a sharp left curve at Riverside Avenue, crossing over the freeway and becoming Highland Avenue again. From here, it leaves Rialto and goes into San Bernardino. It crosses under SR 210, I-215, and SR 259 before entering the city of Highland. In Highland, the original SR 30 crosses under the 210 one last time and ends as it crosses over SR 330\\\\. Some maps still show part of this route as SR 30\\\\. =State Route 30= State Route 30 (SR 30) was the former designation of SR 210 and SR 330\\\\. SR 30 ran from its interchange with I-210 in Glendora east to SR 18 at Big Bear Lake. The easternmost portion of SR 30 was transferred to SR 330 in 1972. Thereafter, SR 30 was routed south to I-10 in Redlands. In 1999, the entirety of SR 30 from the Glendora Curve to Redlands was transferred to Route 210. SR 30 was adopted as a state route in 1933 as part of Legislative Route 190. It was an unsigned highway, running from LRN 9 (formerly US 66, Foothill Blvd) near San Dimas to LRN 26 (SR 38) near Redlands. It also ran from LRN 26 near Redlands to LRN 43 near Big Bear Lake, which would become part of SR 38. During the renumbering of California routes, LRN 190 was split into two different routes. The western portion, between I-210 in San Dimas and Highland became SR 30\\\\. The eastern portion, between SR 38 in Redlands and Highland was combined with LRN 207 (currently SR 330) to form SR 106\\\\. In 1972, the northern portion of SR 106, between SR 30 and SR 18 would be renumbered SR 330. The southern portion, between SR 30 and I-10 (SR 106 was moved to I-10 in 1965) was combined with SR 30. Initial freeway construction started in 1968, and constructed the freeway between SR 259 and Cedar Street in San Bernardino. Construction continued east in 1971, which brought the freeway just west of SR 330\\\\. Construction did not resume until 1989 which extended the freeway west to I-215. The last phase of construction started in 1992, which connected the route south to I-10. In 1968, the state requested that SR 30 be incorporated into the Interstate system, but was declined. The next effort started in 1998. The state decided to close the gap between I-210 and SR 30\\\\. It also decided to number the new freeway as SR 210, in preparation of the route becoming an Interstate. Also, when the new freeway was close to the existing route, the entire route would be renumbered SR 210\\\\. In addition, the short section of the Orange Freeway, which was numbered I-210, would be renumbered SR 57 to match the number used for the rest of the freeway. Construction started on the eastern end from Foothill Boulevard (exit 47), and slowly moved east. In 2007, the mainline freeway section was completed, which ended the existence of SR 30\\\\. =I-215 interchange= The final phase of the Foothill Freeway project involved the completion of the interchange with I-215 (exit 74). When the Foothill Freeway mainline was completed in 2007, exit 74 had only four of its six ramps built, missing movements from SR 210 eastbound to I-215 southbound and from I-215 northbound to SR 210 westbound. The flyover plans for these moves had to be recast to address potential soil liquefaction in the event of rupture of existing or undiscovered faults in the area during an earthquake; this project was separated from the main 210 project to avoid delaying the latter. Completion of exit 74 was also tied to the widening and improving of I-215 in the area. The flyover from northbound I-215 to westbound SR 210 opened on December 22, 2011, while the eastbound SR 210 to southbound I-215 opened on July 23, 2012, thus completing the interchange. = State Route 30 business route = State Route 30 Business (SR 30 Bus.) was a business route of SR 30 that existed from 1964 to 2007 along Highland Avenue from Rialto to Highland; it serves the city centers of both cities. Its main purpose was to divert traffic from the Foothill Freeway and connect traffic from downtown Rialto to Downtown San Bernardino by street. This business route remains signed at the crossing of Waterman Avenue and Palm Street where signs were not taken down but are old and sun bleached.

As a bypass of I-10, both ends of I-210 meet with I-10. Route description Israel LaFleur Bridge The western terminus connects with I-10 east of Sulphur, heading southeast as it bypasses central Lake Charles around the southside. A mile east of the western terminus, I-210 rises over the Israel LaFleur Bridge, one of the highest bridges in the Interstate Highway System, to pass over the Calcasieu Ship Channel. At the southeastern end of the bridge, the highway meets with exit 3, Prien Lake Road, eastbound. I-210 heads east through Lake Charles, turning 90 degrees at exit 8, LA 14/Gerstner Memorial Drive. The highway then heads north towards its eastern terminus with I-10 just east of Lake Charles. Though portions of the freeway run north-south, the entire route is signed east-west. All of I-210 is included as part of the National Highway System, a system of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. History I-210, including the Israel LaFleur Bridge, was constructed between its western terminus and Prien Lake Road circa 1963 to 1965. Initially, the western terminus at I-10 consisted solely of eastbound entrance and westbound exit ramps. The eastern remainder of I-210 was built circa 1975 to 1976, and westbound entrance/eastbound exit ramps were added to the western terminus in 1986. Much of the area surrounding I-210 in southern Lake Charles was developed prior to construction of the freeway. As a result, many homes and businesses in its path were demolished. The freeway remained largely unchanged from its original configuration until 2005, when construction of the L'Auberge du Lac Casino Resort resulted in the addition of a ramp linked to the Nelson Road interchange. Between 2013 and 2015, the Prien Lake Road interchange was rebuilt to allow access to the Golden Nugget Lake Charles. During the planning phase of the freeway, it was known as the South City Bypass. Older signage (prior to the 2000s) referred to the road as the Lake Charles Loop.

History The parish of Abington Pigotts covers an area of . Roughly circular in shape it is surrounded by the parishes of Shingay, Wendy, Bassingbourn, Litlington, and Steeple Morden with its boundaries largely following minor waterways and streams. A settlement from the early Iron Age has been found in the parish, covering around 20 acres a half mile north-west of the church, and was occupied through the Belgic and Roman periods. Pottery from the Anglo-Saxon era has also been found near the site. In early medieval times Abington was sometimes listed as a hamlet of its southern neighbour, Litlington, despite possessing its own church from at least 1200. Listed as Abintone in the Domesday Book of 1086, the name Abington means \\"estate associated with a man called Abba\\". In medieval times the village was variously known as Abington by Shingay, after its neighbouring village, and Abington in the Clay, from the heaviness of its soil, to distinguish it from The Abingtons in the south east of Cambridgeshire. The village became Abington Pigots by the 17th century after the Pykot or Pigott family that owned the manor from the 15th to the 19th century. The village is notable as being the birthplace of Thomas Lester, who was prominent in the rural lacemaking industry in Bedfordshire, establishing a Lace Manufactory business which survived until the onset of machine-made lace in the early 20th century. Church The parish church has been dedicated to St Michael (now St Michael and All Angels) since at least the 13th century and consists of a chancel, nave with south porch and north vestry, and west tower. The present building dates from the 14th century, though the chancel was reconstructed in 1875. The three-stage tower is 15th century, but traces of Romanesque carving from an earlier building can still be seen. Village life The high street consists of a number of small 18th- and 19th-century timber-framed cottages. The largest building on the high street is the village's one pub, The Pig and Abbott, an early 18th-century inn which was known as the Darby and Joan from the early 19th century until the 1980s. A village hall was opened in 1926. A schoolroom was built on the road to the church in around 1850 with the children taught by the wives of the local craftsmen. The number of pupils remained around 40 for the rest of the 19th century but had dropped to 15 in the 1920s. In 1926 older children were sent instead to Bassingbourn with junior children following in 1933. The school reopened on a different site in 1939 but closed again in 1954. Primary children now attend the school in Steeple Morden before moving to Bassingbourn Village College.

It was an historically important river in the development of Canada, and is today a Canadian Heritage River and the longest naturally flowing river in Manitoba. Course The river begins at an elevation of at Molson Lake which is about northeast of the northern tip of Lake Winnipeg. A tributary of Molson Lake, Paimusk Creek, begins less than east of the Nelson River. It leaves Molson Lake and flows north and northeast to Robinson Lake about northeast. Just before reaching Robinson Lake the Echimamish River comes in from the west. This curious river connects directly to the Nelson River and was used by the voyageurs to travel from York Factory on Hudson Bay, up the Hayes and across to the Nelson and downstream to Norway House, Manitoba, at the north end of Lake Winnipeg. Northeast of Robinson Lake is Robinson Falls and the mile-long Robinson portage which was the longest portage between Hudson Bay and Edmonton. Somewhere in this area is Hill Gates, a mile-long narrow gorge. Beyond this it cuts across Logan Lake, passes the settlement of Wetikoweskwattam to Opiminegoka Lake, where it takes the northeast-flowing Lawford River, flows through Windy Lake and over Wipanipanis Falls to Oxford Lake at a point about northeast of its source at Molson Lake. It flows out of the lake at Oxford House then southeast over Trout Falls to Knee Lake. Exiting Knee Lake, the Hayes passes over a series of rapids and via several channels and widens into Swampy Lake. At the east end of Swampy Lake, about northeast of Molson Lake and from Hudson bay is the Dramstone where west-bound travelers took a dram to celebrate leaving the most difficult part of the river. Including the rapids downstream from Knee Lake, in a stretch the Hayes loses 5/7ths of its elevation in 1/6 of its length. From Swampy Lake it runs through a stretch of constant rapids, past Brassy Hill, rising above the river, and takes in the right tributary High Hill River. The river continues northeast through a small canyon for about , therein passing over the Whitemud Falls and Berwick Falls, and takes in the major left tributary Fox River at an elevation of . The Hayes River continues northeast and takes in the major right tributary Gods River at an elevation of , and finally reaches its mouth at Hudson Bay, immediately to the south of the mouth of the larger Nelson River and to the north of the mouth of the smaller Machichi River. upriver from York Factory was Rock Depot where York boats had to be replaced by smaller canoes. It was 30 portages and from Rock Depot to Norway House.James Raffan,\\"Emperor of the North: Sir George Simpson and the Remarkable Story of the Hudson's Bay Company, 2007, page 126 Different parts of the Hayes formerly had different names. According to one sourceEric W. Morse,'Fur Trade Routes of Canada/Then and Now', page 36,1971 they were: \\"Hayes River\\" from the mouth to Gods River, \\"Steel River\\" to the Fox River, \\"Hill River\\" to Knee Lake, \\"Trout River\\" to Oxford Lake, and above Oxford Lake, Weepinipanish River and Franklin's River. Another source has: Trout, Bourbon, Jack Tent, Factory, Steel, Rabbit, and Hill Rivers, and the Rivière du Roc. Watershed The river’s physical characteristics include whitewater rapids, large lake systems, waterfalls, deep valleys and gorges, as well as tidal flats. It is long, has a mean discharge of , and its drainage basin covers . History A brigade of York boats at a portage on the voyageur route by Peter Rindisbacher in 1821 Long before Europeans came to Canada, Manitoba First Nations were using the Hayes River as ancient campsites according to pictographs. It traverses the traditional territory of four First Nations: Norway House Cree Nation, Bunibonibee Cree Nation, Shamattawa First Nation, and York Factory Cree Nation. It continues to be an important source of traditional harvesting for the First Nations. After the arrival of Europeans in North America, the river became an important link in the development of Canada. In 1684, the Hayes River was named for Sir James Hayes, a Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) charter member and secretary to Prince Rupert, by French trader/explorer Pierre Radisson. At its mouth, the HBC established York Factory in 1684, which served as its North American headquarters until 1957. The Hayes was the main route between York Factory and Norway House in the interior of the continent for explorers, fur traders, Voyageurs and European settlers from 1670 to 1870. To get to the Hayes from Norway House required a short trip down the Nelson River, then a turn onto the Echimamish River. The Echimamish River is a bifurcation river and connects two river systems, the Hayes River and the Nelson River. This route became the last leg of the York Factory Express known as \\"the Communication\\", once that was established in the early 19th century, connecting the HBC regional headquarters of the Columbia District at Fort Vancouver to York Factory. Natural history The Hayes flows through some of the most pristine natural areas of Manitoba. It is home to polar bear, wolverine, woodland caribou, the ivory gull, sturgeon, brook trout, beluga whales, bald eagles and moose, as well as a wide range of other wildlife. Traveling from south to north, its banks are lined with dense spruce forests, which change to a mosaic of stunted black spruce, tamarack and bogs. Currently, environmental assessments are being conducted in view of the construction of an all weather bridge north of Wipanipanis Falls where a winter road crosses the Hayes. The Hayes River became a Canadian Heritage River on June 11, 2006. At the confluence of the God's and Hayes river is a marker to a young canoe guide that died at 22 years of age. There is a stone marker and a waterproof can in a grove of trees on the bluff for people to leave a message. Economy Today, the river remains untouched. No dams or development mar its course. It is the longest naturally flowing river in Manitoba and therefore a favorite recreational canoe route. It offers visitors and local people recreational and heritage experience opportunities including canoeing and boating, hunting, fishing, and learning about Canada’s fur trade.

Their line descends from the viscounts of Porhoët and is said to trace back to the legendary Conan Meriadoc. Through the Porhoët, the Rohan are related to the Dukes of Brittany, with whom the family intermingled again after its inception. During the Middle-Ages, it was one of the most powerful families in the Duchy of Brittany. They developed ties with the French and English royal houses as well, and played an important role in French and European history. The only surviving branch of the family is the branch of the Rohan-Rocheforts, Dukes of Montbazon, Dukes of Bouillon and Austrian Princes of Rohan, who migrated in the early 19th century to Austria.Fernand de Saint-Simon, Etienne de Séréville, Dictionnaire de la noblesse française, 1975, p. 869.Henri Jougla de Morenas Raoul de Warren, Grand Armorial de France, vol. 6, p. 45, read online. Following his marriage (1645) with Marguerite de Rohan, only daughter of Henri II de Rohan, first Duke de Rohan (who died in 1638 with no male heir), Henri Chabot, a descendant of the eldest branch of the House of Chabot, from Poitou, was made Duke of Rohan in 1648 and allowed to use the name Rohan- Chabot instead of his own, thus giving birth to the House of Rohan- Chabot.Fernand de Saint-Simon, Etienne de Séréville, Dictionnaire de la noblesse française, 1975, p. 870.Henri Jougla de Morenas, Raoul de Warren, Grand Armorial de France, vol. 2, p. 366 read online.  Origins  The family of Rohan claimed to be descended from first kings of Brittany, and even from the legendary king Conan Meriadoc.=Jean-Yves Copy, ‘’Art, société et politique au temps des ducs de Bretagne’’, Aux Amateurs de livres, 1986, p. 1118. The Rohans were descended from the Viscounts of Porhoët. According to J.-P. Soubigou, the first known viscount, Guethenoc (fl. 1028), was probably Viscount of Rennes as well and connected to the nobility of the Loire region, but he could have belonged to a Breton line holding estates around Josselin, where he built a castle.J.-P. Soubigou, \\"Le Léon dans la Bretagne des Xe-XIe siècles\\", Annales de Bretagne, no 120-4, 2013, p. 14. Guethenoc's son Josselin I († 1074), took part to the Battle of Hastings and conquest of England by William the Conqueror. He was granted lands in Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Gloucestershire, and the town of Caerwent. He was the father of Mainguy, Bishop of Vannes, and Odo I, Viscount of Porhoët, Rohan and Guéméné († after 1092), who married Anne of Léon and had several sons: Geoffrey, who inherited the viscounty of Porhoët, and Alain I the Black (1084-1147), Viscount of Rohan and Castelnoec (fl. 1127), who built the castle of Rohan and was the first member of the House of Rohan. History The Rohans’ estates in the 15th century From the 12th century to the 15th century, the Rohans kept securing and increasing their estates through marriages, acquisitions, inheritances, bequests and exchanges. Thus they became rivals of the Dukes of Brittany all through the Middle Ages, according to their interest, sometimes carrying out the most important charges of the Duchy faithfully, sometimes rebelling, as John II of Rohan did in the last years of Breton independence. The \\"great viscount\\", then more powerful than ever, controlled nearly 200,000 Bretons on about a fifth of the Breton territory.Yvonig Gicquel, Alain IX de Rohan, 1382-1462, Éditions Jean Picollec, 1986, p. 212 The heart of the viscounty of Rohan is made of the rohannais triangleThe rohannais triangle corresponds to the Rochefort-Malestroit-Elven triangle of the House of Rieux. (the three large fortresses of La Chèze, Josselin and Pontivy) whose center is the village of Rohan, the family's nominal fief whose castle is abandoned in favor of the other three.Yvonig Gicquel Alain IX de Rohan, 1382-1462, Éditions Jean Picollec, 1986, p. 102. To counter the power of the immense fiefs of the Rohan and Rieux families, which divided the Armorican peninsula into two equal parts, the Breton dukes denied them access to the coastsIn the north, the castle of Guingamp which covered Tréguier and Paimpol; the castles of the Léguer valley (Tonquédec castle, Coat-an-Noz castle) which covered Lannion and blocked them in the eastern part of the duchy through the fortresses of the Marches of Neustria#Breton March, whose main strongholds were Rennes and Nantes.Alain Guillerm, Fortifications et marine en Occident, L'Harmattan, 1994, p. 92. The Rohans, then unpopular in a very Breton-tradition environment, were neutralized for the time being, and stroke back only with the French army's direct support during the campaign of 1487 in the French- Breton War, which was marked by internal divisions among the barons of Brittany (Rohan, Rieux, Laval...) who constantly changed sides.Nicolas Martin, La France fortifiée : châteaux, villes et places fortes, Nathan, 1990, p. 70. In winter 1487–1488, John II was encircled by the ducal troops: his strongholds of La Chèze, Josselin, Rohan and Pontivy fell one after another in March 1488. The viscount was still coveting the ducal crown for his son but failed. In 1491, the marriage between Anne of Brittany and Charles VIII initiated the annexation of the duchy to the French crown, a union that was permanently ratified in 1532. The Rohan family married several times into the Breton ducal family, the last time in 1407. Henry II of Rohan chose Pontivy as the capital city of his fief. The chief of the Protestant party during Marie de' Medici’s regency Louis XIII’s reign, he was one of the greatest captains of his time.Jean-Loup Avril, Mille Bretons : dictionnaire biographique, Les Portes du Large, 2002, p. 387. In the 17th century, members of the Rohan family began to use their genealogy and their power at the French Court to obtain the rank of prince étranger, thus coming second after the princes du sang before all dukes and peers. Their aim was to prove that the former Kings of Brittany effectively ruled and that the Rohans are directly descended from them. These two assertions were difficult to establish at the time and are not used in the 21st-century historiography.Jean-Paul Soubigou, \\"Le Léon dans la Bretagne des Xe-XIe siècles\\", Annales de Bretagne, no 120-4, 2013, p. 14. The Rohans then applied themselves to giving credence to this version through historians such as Dom Morice, but also through favour, forcing and violating history if needed. The Rohans had to force their claims through thanks to forged evidence (a common practice in these aristocratic families in the Ancien Régime). This operation remained uncertain, the Dukes and peers of France being watchful, and the Rohans secured their position through other means: alliances with other families of princes étrangers exclusively (Lorraine, La Tour d'Auvergne and Condé), elevation of their estates into principalities, legally or not (Guéméné, Soubise, Lordship of Léon), accession to the Bishopric of Strasbourg, giving them the rank of Prince of the Empire, and the use of royal favor and their closeness to the kings (Louis XIV and Madame de Soubise, Louis XV and the Marshal of Soubise, Louis XVI and Madame de Marsan, governess of the Children of France). In spite of attacks from rival families, the Rohans managed to base their power and impose their historical and genealogical views, which provided them with positions allowing them to secure their power and credit at Court. The greatest closeness to the King was then acquired and could not be questioned any more.

Arms The mascles on the arms of the House of Rohan refer to crystal twinnings, which are large crystals of chiastolite (andalusite) that develop in Ordovician schists. They are almost square-sectioned prisms. These stones, which were called appelées pendant des siècles \\"mascles\\", abound in the Salles de Rohan, so much that the Viscounts of Rohan, stricken by their beauty and the likeness with the lozenge, put seven mascles or on their coat of arms; their descendants added two more in the middle of the 16th century.Louis Chauris, Minéraux de Bretagne, Saint-Julien-du-Pinet, Les Éditions du Piat, 2014. =Former arms= Former arms of the Viscounts of Rohan Used by Geoffrey of Rohan between 1216 and 1222: gules, seven mascles or, 3, 3, 1. =Modern arms= Modern arms of the Viscounts of Rohan Used by Henry I of Rohan between 1552 and 1575). The change from the old arms to the modern ones can be explained by the change of the shape of shields from the 14th century: the base is now flat, not pointed, and the empty space is filled by two new mascles. =Motto= A plus: battle cry which may mean “without more”, that is to say, without superior, reminding the Rohans’ claim to be the second most important Breton noble family after the Ducal family, or “even more”, which would be an invitation to always surpass themselvesÉric Mension-Rigau, Les Rohan. Histoire d'une grande famille, Perrin, 2017, p. 11.) is Alan IX’s personal motto, often attributed to the whole family. It is symbolized by the letter A topped with a Ducal crown accompanying the mascles on the coat of arms.Alain Boulaire, Les Rohan, France-Empire, 2001, 346. Another, apocryphal motto, modelled on that of the House of Coucy, is often attributed to the Rohans: Duc je ne daigne, Roi je ne puis, Prince de Bretaigne, de Rohan je suis (Duke I will not, King I cannot, Prince of Brittany, of Rohan I am) or more often: Roi ne puis, duc ne daigne, Rohan suis (King I cannot, Duke I will not, Rohan I am).Édouard Drumont, 1897, p 392. Mon vieux Paris. E. Flammarion (Paris), 2 vol. (XIX-384, XI-435 p.) Roland Barthes will use this model in a joke:Le Plaisir du texte, Paris, Seuil, 1973 Then all writers will say: “Insane I cannot, Sane I will not, neurotic I am.”. Another motto: Rather dead than soiled (Latin: Potius mori quam foedari) which is the motto of the old Dukes of Brittany, the Rohans having been their heirs presumptive since 1532 and the treaty of perpetual Union between Brittany and France.

The plan for HSL-Oost was approved in 1989. The project was cancelled by Transport Minister Tineke Netelenbos in 2001, as it was deemed unprofitable: the gain in travel time and the expected amount of travellers was insufficient to justify the investment of 4–7 billion euros. The decision was influenced by other international high-speed rail construction projects with high and unexpected costs and unforeseen complexities. The scope of the project was reduced to some improvements to the existing railway between Utrecht and the German border. The railway between Amsterdam and Utrecht has been doubled from two to four tracks with the outer tracks prepared for 200 km/h and the overhead wiring prepared for the necessary 25 kV required for high-speed trains, though without 25 kV power supply, high-speed is not attainable. Still, it is expected that German ICE trains will be able to travel at 200 km/h from Amsterdam to Utrecht in the near future.

He is best known for his lead role as Jerry O'Keefe in the MTV Film and follow up television series 2gether, and as host and carpenter within the home- makeover television genre including Emmy-nominated While You Were Out (TLC), Freestyle (HGTV), and Door Knockers (DIY). Early life Farmer was born in Asmara Ethiopia (Now Eritrea) to American parents, and spent a large part of his early childhood traveling the world with his mother, a nurse and family therapist, his father, a prominent dermatopathologist, and his sisters Eliza and Molly. Farmer showed an early interest in the arts after becoming heavily involved in local theatre as well as shooting several television commercials for a local shopping mall in Baltimore, MD. Though Farmer continued with regional theatre and music, it wasn't until he graduated cum laude from Tulane University, having studied architecture and organizational issues management, that he sought professional work in entertainment. Businesses Evan with his Father at The Building Barn, 2017 ;The Building Barn, LLC Farmer currently owns and operates a farm based business in Nashville called The Building Barn he started in 2013, which provides one-week customized building and cooking legacy experiences for families, friends, and team building for businesses. The Building Barn also has a product line Barn Built. ;Real Estate Farmer manages a portfolio of rental properties including apartment complexes, duplexes, and single family homes. CareerMusic= In 1997, Farmer was courted to join Russia's highest selling band in history: Na Na (also written Ha Ha). As part of the courtship, Farmer joined them on a stretch of their 1997 World Tour: Prykinda which included stadium performances throughout the former Soviet Union. Farmer ultimately declined to join the band amid concerns of being out of the country for extended stretches during a time when his mother was battling cancer. It was a year later, that Farmer found himself again on stage playing stadiums and arenas, this time with the spoof Boy band 2gether, which included opening for Britney Spears on her 2000 Oops!... I Did It Again Tour. Farmer co-wrote \\"You're My Baby Girl\\" for 2gether's first album 2ge+her, and was an un-credited co-writer on several of the songs for the follow up album 2Ge+her Again. =Acting= In New York City, Farmer found representation from Abrams Artists Agency and began booking jobs as a print model and actor in national commercials and on soaps including a recurring stint on the Guiding Light. ;The Fantasticks In 1998, Farmer joined the cast of the original Off-Broadway production of The Fantasticks, as Matt (The Boy) in its 38th year, joining a celebrated legacy in the world's longest-running musical and the longest-running uninterrupted show of any kind in the United States. ;Shaft While performing 8 shows a week in The Fantasticks, Farmer spent the early part of the day auditioning for film and television work and began gaining the attention from casting directors who began flying him out to LA for screen tests. By 1998 he landed his first film role alongside Christian Bale in Shaft. ;2Gether It was while filming Shaft that he won the lead role as Jerry O'Keefe in MTV's first made-for-TV movie, 2gether, a film that copied the mockumentary format of This is Spinal Tap, but this time as a parody of the successful boy bands of the time period. The high ratings of the film spurred a TV series of the same name, as well as two back to back gold albums 2ge+her and 2Ge+her Again. The TV series was cancelled at the end of season 2, shortly after the tragic passing of cast member Michael Cuccione. ;Austin Powers In 2000, Farmer auditioned for the role of the Young Dr. Evil in the third of the Austin Powers Franchise, Austin Powers in Goldmember, but when the casting directors saw him walk in the room, they immediately handed him the audition materials for Young Number Two, the part originated by Robert Wagner and also portrayed by Rob Lowe. Farmer became the third actor to step into the role. Farmer has also made guest star appearances in JAG, Working Class, DAG, and voiced several characters on MTV's cartoons; Daria and Celebrity Death Match. =Television hosting= It was while Farmer was in New York City promoting the TV Series 2gether, that he discovered hosting as a potential new career path when the producers of Total Request Live (TRL) called him in frantic need of a replacement host for Carson Daly, who was unable to get to the set for the live broadcast. With minutes to air-time, Farmer ran from his hotel room and hosted the live show, his first time in that role. With several follow up substitutions for Daly over the next year, Farmer began focusing more effort away from acting and towards Host, a career he found far more fulfilling and interesting. ;While You Were Out By 2002, Farmer was in the perfect position to leverage his construction, and architecture background to the burgeoning home make over genre, and became the host of TLC's While You Were Out, a show where an individual sets up a friend or family member with a surprise room redecoration with the help of a crew of designers and carpenters in only 2 days. It was an ideal showcase for Farmer to demonstrate a vast skill set including carpentry, welding, engineering and design, skills he would continue to showcase in several follow up series and specials for HGTV and DIY Network. ;Top 20 Countdown In 2010, Farmer took over as host of CMT's weekly show, Top 20 Countdown for which he was also a producer, replacing Lance Smith, who held the job for eight years.

The name and the territory South Estonian today. Võro language is marked with dark red colour. In modern Estonian literature, the province of Ugaunia is called Ugandi or Ugala. The name Ugandi is derived by associating Ugaunia with the name of Uandimägi Hill near Otepää. According to a more far-fetched theory, the name Ugaunia could have been derived from the Slavic language word Ug, meaning South (cf. Yugoslavia). In Latvian, the country of Estonia is still called Igaunija after Ugaunians, their ancient warlike neighbors. The power center of Ugaunians is believed to have been in the fortified stronghold of Otepää (South Estonian for \\"bear's head\\"; , ) in present-day Linnamägi Hill in the town of Otepää). The hill was indeed shaped like a head of a bear. The bear was probably a holy animal for Ugaunians. Another important Ugaunian stronghold was Tarbatu by the river Emajõgi (literally, \\"Mother River\\"). It was erected around 600 AD on the east side of Toome Hill (Toomemägi) in what is today Tartu. In Estonian folklore, Ugaunians (ugalased) are enemy warriors and robbers. For example, a folk song from Viljandi calls for speeding up the harvest work because Ugaunians might attack. \\"Ugalane\\" has also been used as a disparaging word for an unsophisticated country person. History of UgauniaWars against the Russians= Due to its location, Ugaunia always bore the brunt of East Slavs' attacks against Chudes, as they called Finnic peoples around their North-Eastern boundaries. In 1030 Kievan Prince Yaroslav I the Wise organized a military campaign against Chuds, defeated them and established fort Yuryev (literally \\"Yury's\\" - Yury being Yaroslav's Christian name) in what is modern day Tartu. Kievan rule of Ugaunia may have lasted until 1061, when, according to Russian chronicles, Yuryev was burned down by Sosols (probably Sackalians, Oeselians or Harionenses). Rulers of Novgorod and Pskov made frequent raids against Ugaunians in the 12th century but never succeeded to subjugate them. Fort Bear's Head was conquered in 1116 and 1193, Tharbata in 1134 and 1192. Ugaunians themselves made several raids against Pskov. =The Northern Crusade= At the beginning of the 13th century, a new powerful enemy appeared. German crusaders had established a foothold at the mouth of the Daugava river and started to expand and christen local tribes. The Ugaunians' southern neighbors, the Letts, saw the crusaders as potential allies against their traditional adversaries. The Ugaunians wanted to continue the truce with their new neighbors, but the crusaders had a list of preconditions. They demanded that the Ugaunians pay reparation for an old incident. Many years ago the Ugaunians, upon the advice of the Livonians, had robbed a caravan of German merchants by the Daugava river. In 1207 the crusaders sent a priest called Alabrand to Ugaunia to demand compensation, but did not receive an answer. Next year the Letts and Livonian Brothers of the Sword sent a new delegation to Ugaunia and returned with Ugaunian envoys. Ugaunians were offered \\"eternal peace\\" if they accept Christianity and return everything they had robbed from Germans and Letts. Ugaunians refused and left, threatening the Letts with \\"very sharp lances\\". The crusaders and Letts went to war against Ugaunians. They burned Otepää and returned with captives and booty. Ugaunians and Sackalians retaliated, raided territories of the Letts and burned their worst enemies alive. The Livonians and the Bishop of Riga wanted peace and sent the priest Alabrand to Otepää to negotiate. Alabrand used the gathering of Ugaunians to preach the Christianity to them. Some pagan Ugaunians wanted to kill him because of his preaching, but his status as the messenger of the bishop protected him. Ugaunians made peace with the Bishop of Riga, the leader of the Livonian crusade. In 1210 the Novgorodian prince Mstislav and his brother, Vladimir the prince of Polatsk sent an army against Ugaunians. They besieged Otepää and fought there for eight days. Defenders of the fort suffered a shortage of food and water and were forced to ask for peace. Ugaunians had to accept Orthodox baptism and pay a tribute of 400 \\"nogata\\" marks. (Nogat or nahad is Estonian word for pelts). The same summer Ugaunians of Otepää surrendered to crusader commander Bertold of Wenden. Ugaunians continued to raid Lettish territories. Wars between Ugaunians and Letts lasted the whole decade. The elders of Ugaunians and Letts had deep personal feuds. When Ugaunians captured Tālivaldis of Trikāta in 1215 and burned him alive, his sons burned alive all Ugaunian men they could catch to avenge. They also tortured Ugaunians to force them to show hiding places in the woods. When all Ugaunian provinces were burnt down, the people still alive sent messengers to Riga, asking for peace and promised to receive baptism. They told that all who had been involved in the robbery of German merchants had already been killed. The priests Otto and Peter Kakuwalda were sent to baptize them. Hearing about that, prince Vladimir of Pskov attacked Ugaunians. Ugaunians and German crusaders fortified Otepää and avenged Russians, raiding lands of Pskov and Novgorod. After that Ugaunians went with crusaders, Livonians and Letts against Estonian pagan provinces Jerwia and Vironia. Prince Vladimir of Pskov sent messengers through all of Estonia to besiege Germans and Ugaunians at Otepää. Harrians and Oeselians came and even already baptized Sackalians. While troops of 20000 of Russians and Oeselians attacked Otepää, Ugaunians alongside with crusaders made raids against Novgorod, Vironians and Votians. In 1220 Ugaunians rebelled against the Germans. Sackalians sent bloody swords with which they had killed Germans to Ugaunians of Tharbata and Otepää. In Tharbata they decided by lot whether to sacrifice to the gods an ox or their priest Hartwig, who was equally fat. Luckily for the priest, the lot fell upon the ox. Ugaunians decided to side with Novgorodians. Russian princes of Pskov, Novgorod and Suzdal sent huge troops of 20000 men to Ugaunia. The people of Tharbata sent them large gifts and Otepää welcomed them too. The Russians left Vyachko (Vetseke) as their prince to rule Ugaunians and any other Estonian province around he could gathered tax from. In 1224 crusaders retook all provinces in mainland Estonia. After casting lot, bishop Hermann of Buxhoeveden was given rule over Ugaunia while Sackala was given to the order. Otepää was happy over the rule of bishop Hermann but Tharbata was still ruled by Vetseke and his Russians. Later that year however, Tharbata was conquered and all its Ugaunian and Russian defenders killed. Bishop Hermann started to fortify Otepää and Tarbatu. He chose Tharbata/Dorpat to be his residence. Bishop Hermann and his Ugaunian subjects fought frequently against Novgorod and were defeated by prince Alexander Nevsky in the Battle on Lake Peipus in 1242. Ugaunia became subsequently known as the Bishopric of Dorpat.

The Fourth Gorkha Rifles has five infantry battalions. The regiment was raised in 1857 as part of the British Indian Army. In 1947, after India's independence, the Fourth Gurkha Rifles became part of the Indian Army as the Fourth Gorkha Rifles. The regiment has seen action in wars in Africa, Europe and Asia, including the Second Afghan War, the Boxer Rebellion (China), World War I, and World War II. Since Independence, in 1947, the regiment has seen action in the India-Pakistan Wars of 1947–48, 1965, 1971, 1987, and 1999, and the Chinese aggression in 1962. The Regiment has also participated in UN Peace-keeping Missions. History In 1857, in the wake of the 1857 rebellion, an Extra Goorkha Regiment, was raised at Pithoragarh, (Uttar Pradesh), as part of the old Indian army, and was briefly known as 19th Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry. Following the decision in 1861, to number the Goorkha Regiments sequentially, in order of raising, the Regiment was designated as the 4th Goorkha Regiment. In 1924, the regiment was honored with Royal connection and redesignated as the 4th Prince of Wales' Own (PWO) Gurkha Rifles and Edward Albert, the Prince of Wales, later the lovelorn King Edward VIII, was appointed as Colonel-in-Chief. In 1950, after India become a republic, the appellation PWO was discarded. In 1866, Bakloh was acquired as Goorkha Cantonment for the 4th Goorkha Regiment and Balun, Dalhousie Cantonment, as cantonment for British troops, along with a sliver of territory to connect the two cantonments, from the Raja of Chamba for a sum of Rupees 5000. Bakloh, a hill station, remained the home, and the Regimental Center and Depot, of the 4th Gurkha Rifles, for 82 years, from 1866 to 1948. =1857–1914= Between 1857 and 1914, the regiment saw action in small wars, in India's North East, in the Lushai Hills, present day Mizoram, and along India's North-West Frontier, including during the Second Afghan War. In 1900 the Regiment formed part of the Expeditionary Force deployed to China in response to the Boxer Rebellion. In 1903, in Somalia, during the Third Somaliland Campaign, Captain William George Walker, a Regimental officer, on deputation with Somali Camel Corps, became the first person from the regiment to be awarded the Victoria Cross, for risking his life to save the life of another officer.Parker 2005, p. 392. =World War I= World War I: 1/4th GR at kit and kukris inspection, 24 Jul 1915, in France. Soon after the start of World War I, the 1st Battalion 4th Gurkha Rifles (1/4 GR), was deployed to France, as part of 9th (Sirhind) Brigade, the 3rd (Lahore) Division, Indian Corps, to form part of Indian Expeditionary Force A, to reinforce British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France. The orbat of Sirhind Brigade included one British infantry battalion (1st Battalion, Highland Light Infantry), one Indian (125th Napier's Rifles) and two Gurkha (1/1st Gurkha Rifles and 1/4th). The battalion arrived at Marseilles from Egypt on 30 November, and was hurriedly deployed to the front in December 1914.Edmonds, 1914, Vol II, Appendix 1.F.W. Perry & A.F. Becke, Orders of Battle. As a part of the Sirhind brigade, 1/4 GR GR saw action in the battles of Givenchy, Neuve Chapelle and Ypres, in France. The battalion was sent to Gallipoli, disembarked on 1 September 1915 and departed on 19 December 1915. In April 1916 the 3rd (Lahore) Division was deployed to Mesopotamia. The 2nd Battalion 4th Gurkha Rifles (2/4) saw service in Mesopotamia, present day Iraq. 3rd Battalion, 4th Gurkha Rifles (3/4 GR), was ordered to be raised during the war; but due to a clerical error the 4th Battalion, 3rd Gurkha Rifles (4/3) was raised. 3/4 GR was eventual raised in World War II, in Bakloh, on 1 October 1940. =World War I War Diaries = Transcripts of War Diaries of Indian army units and formations that participated in World War I, including 1st Battalion 4th Gurkha Rifles (1/4 GR), 3rd (Lahore) Division, are now available on line, as part of \\"Operation War Diary\\", a Zooniverse, crowdsourced project. The transcripts of 1/4 GR war diaries, which provide interesting insights into day-to-day activities, movements of the unit and subunits, and individual experiences of officers and soldiers are now available on Zooniverse web site. = World War II = During World War II, the third and fourth battalions (3/4 GR and 4/4 GR) were raised in Bakloh, on 15 November 1940 and on 15 March 1941 respectively. The battalions of the regiment saw action in Iraq and Syria, in the Middle East, Egypt, in North Africa, Cyprus, in the Mediterranean, Italy, in Europe, India's border areas in Nagaland, Manipur, and Mizoram, and the Far East. Burma Campaign During the Burma Campaign the first battalion (1/4 GR) formed part of 48 Infantry Brigade, which in turn was part of the 17th Indian Infantry Division. It took part in the Battle of Sittang Bridge in February 1942, and the retreat into India. During this period the battalion was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel \\"Joe\\" Lentaigne. In 1944 the battalion suffered very high casualties in the Battle of Imphal. Soon after it was raised in October 1940, the third battalion (3/4 GR) was assigned to the 111th Indian Infantry Brigade. This brigade was part of the Chindits and was commanded by \\"Joe\\" Lentaigne, who had been promoted to Brigadier. It took part in the Second Chindit Expedition, Operation Thursday, in 1944. When Major General Orde Wingate, the overall commander of the Chindits, was killed in an air crash, Brigadier Lentaigne succeeded him. Major John Masters took command of the main body of 111 Brigade. The fourth Battalion (4/4 GR) distinguished itself in the storming of Mandalay Hill in Burma, in 1945. Iraq, Syria, and Italy 2/4 GR was the only Battalion of the 4 Gorkha Rifles that served in the Middle East and Europe. In the wake of the growing threats to Iraq following the fall of France, the battalion embarked from Karachi in May 1941. It disembarked in Shatt-Al-Arab, on 5 May 1941. In Iraq it formed part of 10 Indian Infantry Division, commanded by Maj Gen Bill Slim, later Field Marshal Slim. Except for the Commanding Officer and few field officers, all officers were Emergency Commissioned Officers. On 24 May 1941, it participated in the operations to secure Basra, and areas north of Basra, along the west bank of River Euphrates, in a combined all arms, night assault. On 25 May 1941, the battalion was air lifted to reinforce and secure Habbaniyanh, a RAF base, under threat from Iraqi ground troops and German aerial attacks from Luftwaffe, based in Mosul, and Baghdad. In June 1941, after a successful campaign in Iraq, including securing of Haditha, the battalion was deployed in Syria, against the Vichy French army, and along the Syria _Turkish border. In Syria, it participated in operation to capture Deir ez-Zor, and the occupation of Raqqa, which has lately gained prominence as the epi-centre of ISIL or Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant activities. After the successful campaigns Iraq, Syria, along the Persian border, the battalion left Iraq by road for Palestine, to participate in the war in North Africa where it was overrun by two Bersaglieri battalions of the Italian Trento Division storming the fortress of Mersa Matruh on 29 June 1942. It was later rebuilt and deployed to Cyprus and subsequently fought in the Italian Campaign. =Regiment in books= A prominent figure who joined the 4th Gurkha Rifles as a regular officer during the thirties, was the author John Masters, who participated in operations on the North West Frontier, in Iraq (where he served as battalion adjutant), the Second Chindit Operation, the capture of Mandalay and at one point commanded the 3rd Battalion of the regiment. His autobiographical books Bugles and a Tiger, The Road past Mandalay, and Pilgrim's Son portray life in the Indian Army and the 4th Gurkha Rifles during this period. Masters won a Military Cross (MC), and Distinguished Service Order (DSO), in Burma, and after the war become a celebrated writer.  Customs, traditions, and Regimental Arcana  The Regiment drills and standards are similar to British 'Greenjackets'. It marches 'quickstep' at 180 paces a minute on parade, the same pace as the other Indian Army rifle regiments, in its own ceremonies. Commanders in 4th Gorkha Rifles, unlike other regiments in the Indian Army, but like the many former Rifle Regiments of the British Army (and now the some regiment The Rifles), wear (a plain Black) Lanyard attached to a whistle over the Jersey. The intention of this arrangement is to facilitate use of the whistle with the left hand, while leaving the right hand free to use the sword. The uniform and insignia are Spartan; the regiment prides itself on its simplicity and disregard for pomp and ceremony.'4 GR', in black metal, is worn as regimental signage on the shoulder straps by all ranks. The official, and correct, spelling of 'gorkha', since February 1949, is Gorkha, and not Gurkha, as the British still choose to spell it.  Uniform  The first uniforms obtained for the regiment, during the chaotic period of 1857–58, were makeshift whites dyed khaki-drab in the bazaar. Rifle-green uniforms with black cuff facings were subsequently adopted to be worn with the round peakless Kilmarnock cap common to all Gurkha regiments.W. Y. Carman, pages 204-205 \\"Indian Army Uniforms Under the British From the 18th Century to 1947: Artillery, Engineers and Infantry\\", Morgsn- Grampian: London 1969 Together with black metal buttons and insignia these items were to remain features of the dress uniforms of the regiment until the present day. Khaki drill was worn for active service and hot-weather dress from 1873 on. John Masters records that the historic rifle-green was retained only for mess uniforms and wear by pipers and mess orderlies after World War I.John Masters, page 79 \\"Bugles and a Tiger\\", The New English Library Limited 1962  Regimental Centre  The Regimental Center was formed on 15 November 1940 in Balkoh. The first commandant was Colonel TDC Owens, MC, who commanded the centre for five years during World War II. page369 = Transition 1947-48= In 1947, just before independence, all Gorkha Regiments, including the 4th Gorkha Rifles (GR), received orders from the Commander in Chief of the Indian army, that Gorkha regiments which opt to remain with the Indian army, were to be transferred 'intact', including mess property and regimental funds. British officers of many Gorkha Regiments, including 5 RGR (FF) and 9 GR, did not comply with these instructions and transferred funds and properties to England before 15 August 1947. 4 GR too managed to transfer part of the regiment funds before independence to England. These regimental funds were used to fund a corpus for a war memorial, for publishing volume 3 of the regimental history, and Rupees 8000, was used to transfer and install the memorial tablet in the St Oswald Church in Bakloh to England. The last British commandant of the Centre was Colonel RAN Davidson, formerly 2/4 GR, a bachelor who had spent much of World War II as a Japanese POW. He took over the Centre for three months on 1 January 1948. He handed over the Centre on 18 January 1948 to Lt Colonel Rajbir Chopra, formerly of the Rajput Regiment, who became the first Indian commandant of the 4GRRC. Colonel Ran Davidson, however, continued as adviser till 27 March 1948. Colonel RAN Davidson in his short tenure managed to gain the affection and respect of the young officers. The Subedar Major of the 4GRRC in 1948 was SM Sher Jung, the previous SM Agam Gurung having been promoted as officer. The Regiment was allowed to promote thirteen Gorkha Officers as commissioned officers. In 1948 out of total of 50 officers posted to Gorkha Regiments from Indian Military Academy (IMA), Dehradun, to make up for the departing British officers, 9 young officers were posted to 4GRRC, Bakloh. Of these 9 young officers (YOs), 6 remained with the regiment, the rest were posted to other regiments after a short stay at Bakloh. The YOs traveled to Bakloh on 4 January 1948, on the same day, as Colonel RAN Davidson, the new commandant of 4GRRC. =Move from Bakloh= In the wake of the Partition of India, in 1947, the 4th Gorkha Rifles (GR) Regimental Center and Depot, was shifted from Bakloh to Dharamshala, the Centre of the 1 Gorkha Rifles, then to Chakrata, and Clement Town, in Dehradun, and finally to Sabathu, Shimla Hills, HP in April 1960.

Fourth Gorkha Rifles Officers' Association  The Fourth Gorkha Rifles Officers' Association, is an association of serving and retired officers of the 4th Gorkha Rifles (4 GR), an infantry regiment of the Indian Army. The 4 GR has two Officers Associations: one in the India, and another in the United Kingdom (UK). The two officers associations have had, and continue to have, close relations. = 4 GR officers Association, UK = The officers association in the UK, known as the 4th Prince of Wales' (PWO) Gurkha Rifles Officers' Association, is an association of former British Officers of the 4GR, formed on 13 June 1947, on the initiative of the late Major General Arthur Mill, who is fondly referred to as Uncle Arthur. The aim of the association, Sir Arthur Mills in a letter to Colonel Hamish Mackay, the centre commandant, in Bakloh, said was \\" until the end of the century to keep alive the history and traditions of the Regiment\\". The 4 GR officers Association, UK, in memory of its association with the 4 GR maintains the Gurkha Memorial Gardens, near the St Giles Church, in Stoke Poges, South Buckinghamshire district of Buckinghamshire, England. The UK association is smaller than the main association in India; and is fast dwindling on account of age and attrition. The head of the British 4 GR officers Association is Dicky Day. The UK association celebrated its golden jubilee on 13 June 1997, with alarge gathering, church service, exchange of messages, speeches, a sit down lunch for 132, at the stoke Park Golf club, and toasts to the Regiment, the Queen, the President of India, and the King of Nepal. The Golden Jubilee was covered by a TV crew from BBC, and the pipe and drums from 1st Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles was in attendance to make ' a Figure of Eight, showing Spy Roll and slow to quick followed by three Sets and Retreat'. The Indian contingent at the Golden jubilee get together included 4 serving, and two retired officers, including the Colonel of the Regiment, Lt General Baldev Singh, and COs of 1/4, 2/4, and 3/4 Gorkha Rifles, and their wives. = 4 GR Officers Association, India = The Officers Association of 4 GR, in India, of which all serving and retired 4 GR officers are members, is called the Fourth Gorkha Rifles Officers' Association. It was formed at the initiative of late Major General GS Gill, former Colonel of 4 GR. The head of the Indian and the UK associations, known as the President of the Fourth Gorkha Rifles Association, is usually a senior retired officer of the Regiment, and often a former Colonel of the Regiment. He serves as a link between the British and the India 4 GR Associations. The current President of the 4GR Officers association is Major General (Retired) B D Kale, formerly of 2/4 GR. = Relations between the Indian and British officers' Associations = The relations between the Indian and the UK 4 GR Officers associations have been, and remain, close and active. They exchange visits, letters, mementos, and memories. Indian officers on visit to the UK often visit Stoke Poges, meet old officers, and attend 'Remembrance day'. British officers, in turn, are often guest of the 4 Gorkha Rifles Officers Association, in India, and are invariably invited to attend Reunion and Jubilee celebrations. In 2011, Maj Geoffery Loyd, formerly 1/4 GR, attended the 125 year anniversary celebration of the 2/4 GR, in Trivandrum, Kerela, in April 2011, and the Reunion, 2011, 27–29 November 2011, in Sabathu, HP, along with a 10 British dependent 'members'. During the reunion Major Lloyd, laid wreath at the war memorial, made a speech, and presented 357 pounds to the '4GR welfare fund', on behalf of the British contingent, and before leaving told the President of the 4 GR Association that because of his age this would be his last visit to India.  Fourth Gorkha Rifles Officers' Association Newsletters  The Officers Association of Fourth Gorkha Rifles publishes an annual Newsletter (NL). The NL has been in print since 1977. The first NL was brought out by Lt Colonel Vijay Madan, VSM, during the Regimental reunion in February 1977, the second reunion held after 1957 reunion. In 1997 it was decided that the NL, starting with NL 22, will also have a Nepali section. Each battalion was expected to submit at least two articles in Nepalese for the NL. The NL operates on shoe string budget. The charges for bringing out NL 21, in 1997, was a mere Rupees 14,539. It is published with the assistance of 14 Gorkha Rifles Training Centre, Sabathu Cantonment. = Editor and publisher = The editor of the NL is chosen by consensus from among volunteer retired officers of the regiment and is appointed by the President of the 4 GR Association. Past NL editors have included Lt Colonel Vijay Madan (1977-1980), Brigadier Hem Tiwari (1981–84), Brigadier NK Gurung (1985–86), Brigadier HS Sodhi, formerly of 4/4 GR (1987–93), and Brigadier, (Retired), Prem K Gupta, formerly 5/4 GR.

He was best known for his role as \\"Q.T.\\" in the fictional boy band 2gether. BiographyPersonal life= Cuccione was born in Burnaby, British Columbia, and raised in neighbouring Coquitlam.CCR: Michael Cuccione Foundation Retrieved on 9 January 2017 =Entertainment career= In July 1997, a request Cuccione made to meet Baywatch star David Hasselhoff led to a role in an episode on the show as real-life cancer victim Charlie Dodson Hays. The producers of 2ge+her had already agreed to shoot the movie (and later the series) in Vancouver when they discovered Cuccione and cast him in the part of Jason \\"QT\\" McKnight. The series was an immediate hit, as was the subsequent soundtrack from the show. The spoof boy band became so popular with fans and artists that they went on tour and opened for Britney Spears. Both soundtracks hit the Billboard Top 100. The 2ge+her movie was released on February 21, 2000, and the series soon followed on August 15 of that same year, on MTV's 10 Spot. =Illness and advocacy= In 1994, when Cuccione was 9, he was diagnosed with stage 2A Hodgkin's lymphoma, a form of cancer affecting the lymph nodes. It was treated with five months of chemotherapy, but returned the following year. His second bout with the disease metastasized to his lungs. He required massive doses of chemotherapy, a bone marrow transplant, and twelve radiation treatments around his heart and lungs. He was then cancer free, but the treatment left him with permanent lung and respiratory problems. Cuccione became a well-known campaigner for cancer research and awareness. The singer/actor established The Michael Cuccione Foundation for Cancer Research and turned his love for music into a fundraising effort by recording a five-song CD, Make a Difference. He also co-authored a book with his grandmother titled, There are Survivors: The Michael Cuccione Story about his experiences battling cancer; his effort eventually raised C$500,000, which was donated to the British Columbia's Children's Hospital. Cuccione made many in-person appearances on television, radio, at schools and hospitals, and other fundraising events. =Death= As the second season of 2ge+her started taping, Cuccione soon began suffering breathing problems from complications from his earlier cancer treatments and required an oxygen tank on-set. His problems increased, and soon he had to miss several tapings of the show and public group appearances. In December 2000, Cuccione was unable to fight off the effects of a minor car accident and entered the hospital on December 4, 2000, with pneumonia. He spent the rest of his stay on a respirator and celebrated his last Christmas, New Year's, and birthday in the hospital before succumbing to respiratory failure on January 13, 2001, eight days after his 16th birthday. =Funeral= Thousands packed the church in Vancouver, British Columbia on the Wednesday evening of January 17, 2001, and again on the next morning to mourn. All four of Cuccione's 2ge+her band/cast members were in attendance for both services. Also in attendance was David Hasselhoff, who gave the eulogy and dedicated a song at the Wednesday services. Both services included a 75-member choir from Cuccione's high school, Notre Dame Regional Secondary School. Among the items displayed were pictures of Cuccione being blessed by the Pope, a giant poster of Cuccione with a teddy bear, and a massive set of wreaths and flowers. During the Thursday services, a huge procession of limousines, cars, and firetrucks accompanied Cuccione's casket through the streets of Greater Vancouver. He was buried at Ocean View Burial Park in Burnaby Greater Vancouver Regional District British Columbia, Canada.

Ugandi had an area of approximately 3000 hides. Ugandi corresponded roughly to the present Estonia's territory of Võru County, Põlva County and half of Tartu County and Valga County, as well as Petseri County. The county was first mentioned in print by Henry of LivoniaThe Chronicle of Henry of Livonia After the Northern crusades it became the Bishopric of Dorpat. In Latvian: Igaunija (Ugaunija is the Latvian name for the Ugaunia county) is still the modern national name for Estonia.Igaunija at lv.wikipedia The name Ugandi is derived by associating \\"Ugaunia\\" with the name of Uandimägi Hill near Otepää. An alternate theory proposes that the name \\"Ugaunia\\" could have been derived from the Slavic language word \\"Ug\\", meaning \\"South\\" (cf. Yugoslavia). The power center of Ugandi is believed to have been in the fortified stronghold of Otepää (Ugaunian for \\"bear's head\\"; , ) in present-day Linnamägi Hill in the town of Otepää. The hill is indeed shaped like a head of a bear, thought to have been a holy animal for Ugaunians. Another important Ugaunian stronghold was Tarbatu by the river Emajõgi (literally, \\"Mother River\\"). It was erected around 600 AD on the east side of Toome Hill (Toomemägi) in what is today Tartu. Due to its location, Ugandi always bore the brunt of East Slavs' attacks against Chudes, as they called Finnic peoples around their North-Eastern boundaries.  History  In 1030 Kievan Prince Yaroslav I the Wise organized a military campaign against Chuds, defeated them and established fort Yuryev (literally \\"Yury's\\" - Yury being Yaroslav's Christian name) in what is modern day Tartu. Kievan rule of Tartu/Tarbatu may have lasted 30 years until 1061, when, according to Old East Slavic chronicles, Yuryev was burned down by Sosols (probably Sackalians, Oeselians or Harionenses). In modern Estonian literature, the province of Ugaunia is called Ugandi or Ugala. In Latvian, the country of Estonia is still called Igaunija after Ugaunians, their ancient warlike neighbors. In Estonian folklore, Ugaunians (ugalased) are enemy warriors and robbers. For example, a folk song from Viljandi calls for speeding up the harvest work because Ugaunians might attack. \\"Ugalane\\" has also been used as a disparaging word for an unsophisticated country person. Rulers of Novgorod Republic and Principality of Pskov made frequent raids against Ugaunians in the 12th century but never succeeded to subjugate them. Fort Bear's Head was conquered in 1116 and 1193, Tarbatu in 1134 and 1192. Ugaunians themselves made several raids against Pskov. At the beginning of the 13th century, a new powerful enemy appeared. German crusaders had established a foothold at the mouth of the Daugava river and started to expand and christen local tribes. The Ugaunians' southern neighbors, the Latgalians (or Letts), saw the crusaders as potential allies against their traditional adversaries. The Ugaunians wanted to continue the truce with their new neighbors, but the crusaders had a list of preconditions. They demanded that the Ugaunians pay reparation for an old incident. Many years ago the Ugaunians, upon the advice of the Livonians, had robbed a caravan of German merchants by the Daugava river. In 1207 the crusaders sent a priest called Alabrand to Ugaunia to demand compensation, but did not receive an answer. Next year the Letts and Teutonic Knights sent a new delegation to Ugaunia and returned with Ugaunian envoys. Ugaunians were offered \\"eternal peace\\" if they accept Christianity and return everything they had robbed from Germans and Letts. Ugaunians refused and left, threatening the Letts with \\"very sharp lances\\". The crusaders and Letts went to war against Ugaunians. They burned Otepää and returned with captives and booty. Ugaunians and Sackalians retaliated, raided territories of the Letts and burned their worst enemies alive. The Livonians and the Bishop of Riga wanted peace and sent the priest Alabrand to Otepää to negotiate. Alabrand used the gathering of Ugaunians to preach the Christianity to them. Some pagan Ugaunians wanted to kill him because of his preaching, but his status as the messenger of the bishop protected him. Ugaunians made peace with the Bishop of Riga, the leader of the Livonian Crusade. In 1210 the Novgorodian prince Mstislav the Bold and his brother, Vladimir the Prince of Polatsk, sent an army against Ugaunians. They besieged Otepää and fought there for eight days. Defenders of the fort suffered a shortage of food and water and were forced to ask for peace. Ugaunians had to accept Orthodox baptism and pay a tribute of 400 \\"nogata\\" marks. (Nogat or nahad is Estonian word for pelts). The same summer Ugaunians of Otepää surrendered to crusader commander Bertold of Wenden. Ugaunians continued to raid Lettish territories. Wars between Ugaunians and Letts lasted the whole decade. The elders of Ugaunians and Letts had deep personal feuds. When Ugaunians captured Tālivaldis of Trikāta in 1215 and burned him alive, his sons burned alive all Ugaunian men they could catch to avenge. They also tortured Ugaunians to force them to show hiding places in the woods. When all Ugaunian provinces were burnt down, the people still alive sent messengers to Riga, asking for peace and promised to receive baptism. They told that all who had been involved in the robbery of German merchants had already been killed. The priests Otto and Peter Kakuwalda were sent to baptize them. Hearing about that, prince Vladimir of Pskov attacked Ugaunians. Ugaunians and German crusaders fortified Otepää and avenged Russians, raiding lands of Pskov and Novgorod. After that Ugaunians went with crusaders, Livonians and Letts against Estonian pagan provinces Jerwia and Vironia. Prince Vladimir of Pskov sent messengers through all of Estonia to besiege Germans and Ugaunians at Otepää. Harrians and Oeselians came and even already baptized Sackalians. While troops of 20000 of Novgorodians and Œselians attacked Otepää, Ugaunians alongside with crusaders made raids against Novgorod, Vironians and Votians. In 1220 Ugaunians rebelled against the Germans. Sackalians sent bloody swords with which they had killed Germans to Ugaunians of Tarbatu and Otepää. In Tarbatu they decided by lot whether to sacrifice to the gods an ox or their priest Hartwig, who was equally fat. Luckily for the priest, the lot fell upon the ox. Ugaunians decided to side with Novgorodians. Russian princes of Pskov, Novgorod and Suzdal sent huge troops of 20000 men to Ugaunia. The people of Tarbatu sent them large gifts and Otepää welcomed them too. The Russians left Vetseke as their prince to rule Ugaunians and any other Estonian province around he could gathered tax from. In 1224 crusaders retook all provinces in mainland Estonia. After casting lot, bishop Hermann of Buxhoeveden was given rule over Ugaunia while Sackala was given to the order. Otepää was happy over the rule of bishop Hermann but Tarbatu was still ruled by Vetseke and his Ruthenians. Later that year however, Tarbatu was conquered and all its Ugaunian and Ruthenian defenders killed. Bishop Hermann started to fortify Otepää and Tarbatu. He chose Tarbatu/Dorpat to be his residence. Bishop Hermann and his Ugaunian subjects fought frequently against Novgorod and were defeated by prince Alexander Nevsky in the Battle on Lake Peipus in 1242. Ugaunia became subsequently known as the Bishopric of Dorpat.

His resignation in 1992, after it was revealed he had had an affair with an American woman, was a pivotal moment in Ireland's relationship with the Catholic church. Subsequently, a number of women made allegations against Casey that they were sexually abused by him, two of which received compensation following a High Court trial. One of the women, his niece Patricia Donovan, alleged in 2019 that she was repeatedly raped by Casey when she was five years old and assaulted sexually by him for more than a decade. Priest and bishop Casey was born on 24 April 1927 in County Kerry. He was educated in Limerick and in St Patrick's College, Maynooth. Casey was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Limerick on 17 June 1951 and appointed Bishop of Kerry on 17 July 1969. He held this position until 1976, when he was appointed Bishop of Galway and Kilmacduagh and apostolic administrator of Kilfenora. While in Galway, Casey was seen as a progressive. It was a significant change in a diocese that had been led for nearly forty years by the very conservative Michael Browne (Bishop from 1937 to 1976). Casey was highly influential in the Irish Catholic hierarchy, and served as bishop until his resignation in 1992. He was a friend and colleague of another highly prominent Irish priest, Father Michael Cleary. ViewsIrish emigrants= Casey worked aiding Irish emigrants in Britain. In addition, he supported the Dunnes Stores' staff, who were locked out from 1982 to 1986 for refusing to sell goods from apartheid South Africa. =US foreign policy= Casey attended the funeral of the murdered Archbishop of San Salvador, Monsignor Óscar Romero. He witnessed first hand the massacre of those attending the funeral by government forces. He then became a vocal opponent of United States foreign policy in Central America, and, as a result, opposed the 1984 visit of United States President Ronald Reagan to Ireland, refusing to meet him when he came to Galway. Scandal, resignation, and later life In 1992 it was reported that Casey had had a sexual relationship in the early 1970s with American citizen Annie Murphy. Murphy became pregnant; Casey was determined that the child should be given up for adoption, but Murphy resisted, and returned to the United States with their son, Peter, born in 1974 in Dublin. Casey made payments for the boy's maintenance, but refused to develop a relationship with him. Murphy was very disappointed by this, and ultimately, in the early 1990s, contacted The Irish Times to tell the story. Casey admitted that he had sinned, and wronged the boy, his mother, \\"God, his church and the clergy and people of the dioceses of Galway and Kerry\\", resigned as bishop, and left the country. Murphy published a book, Forbidden Fruit, in 1993 revealing details of their relationship.Annie Murphy, Peter de Rosa; Forbidden Fruit: the true story of my secret love for the Bishop of Galway (1993); Casey was succeeded by his secretary, James McLoughlin, who served in the post until his own retirement on 3 July 2005. Casey became a missionary alongside members of the Missionary Society of St. James in a rural parish in Ecuador, whose language, Spanish, he did not speak. During this time, he travelled long distances to reach the widely scattered members of his parish. After his missionary period was completed, Casey took a position in the parish of St. Pauls, Haywards Heath, in south-east England. In 2005, Casey was investigated in conjunction with the sexual abuse scandal in Galway, Kilmacduagh and Kilfenora diocese, and cleared of any wrongdoing. In 2019, it emerged that Casey had faced at least three accusations of sexual abuse before his death, with two High Court cases being settled.https://extra.ie/2019/03/24/news/irish-news/bishop-eamonn-casey- accused-of-rape-of-niece The Kerry diocese confirmed that it had received allegations against him, that Gardaí and health authorities had been informed and that the person concerned was offered support by the diocese. He returned to Ireland in 2006, but was not permitted to say Mass in public. He is the subject of Martin Egan's song \\"Casey\\", sung by Christy Moore. He is also the subject of the Saw Doctors' song \\"Howya Julia\\". =Illness and death= In August 2011, Casey was admitted to a nursing home in County Clare because he was in poor health. He died on 13 March 2017 at the age of 89, a month before his 90th birthday.

The gag name pokes fun at the perceived propensity of some lawyers and accountants to take advantage of their clients: The name of the firm is a pun on the phrase \\"Do we cheat 'em? And how?\\" This gag name is also used more broadly as a placeholder for any hypothetical law firm. The second name varies somewhat with regards to spelling (Cheetem, Cheater, Cheethem, Cheatham, etc.), but also to the word upon which it is based (Screwum, Burnham, etc.). Examples The name of the DC&H; corporate offices (otherwise known as the headquarters of the radio show Car Talk) is visible on the third floor window above the corner of Brattle and JFK Streets, in Harvard Square, Cambridge, Massachusetts. Tom and Ray Magliozzi, of NPR's Car Talk radio program, named their business corporation \\"Dewey, Cheetham & Howe\\". Their corporate offices were located on a third-floor office at the corner of Brattle and JFK Streets in Harvard Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Magliozzi brothers declared that they established DC&H; in 1989. A popular poster for The Three Stooges features the Stooges as bumbling members of such a firm, although the actual episodes use the name \\"Dewey, Burnham, and Howe\\". The 2012 film uses this example, among similar ones such as proctologists \\"Proba, Keister, and Wince\\" and divorce lawyers \\"Ditcher, Quick, and Hyde.\\" In the film Heavenly Daze, Moe and Larry deal with a crooked attorney named \\"I.

Mankiewicz, and starring Richard Widmark, Linda Darnell, Stephen McNally and Sidney Poitier, who portrays a doctor tending to slum residents whose ethics are tested when confronted with racism, personified by Richard Widmark as the hateful robber Ray Biddle.. No Way Out marked the feature film debuts of Sidney Poitier and actress Mildred Joanne Smith. Joseph L. Mankiewicz and Lesser Samuels were also nominated for Best Story and Screenplay at the 23rd Academy Awards losing to Charles Brackett, Billy Wilder, and D. M. Marshman Jr. for Sunset Boulevard. Plot Dr. Luther Brooks (Sidney Poitier), an intern who has just passed the state board examination to qualify for his license to practice, is the first African- American doctor at the urban county hospital at which he trained. Because he lacks self-confidence, Brooks requests to work as a junior resident at the hospital for another year. Johnny (Dick Paxton) and Ray Biddle (Richard Widmark), brothers who were both shot in the leg by a policeman as they attempted a robbery, are brought to the hospital's prison ward. As Luther tends to the disoriented Johnny, he is bombarded with racist slurs by Ray, who grew up in Beaver Canal, the white working class section of the city. Believing that Johnny has a brain tumor, Luther administers a spinal tap, but Johnny dies during the procedure. Wondering if Ray's antagonism may have caused him to be careless, Luther consults his mentor, chief medical resident Dr. Daniel Wharton (Stephen McNally), and Wharton concedes that a brain tumor was only one possibility. Feeling that he must prove the accuracy of his diagnosis, Luther requests an autopsy, but Wharton informs him that according to state law, they cannot proceed without the permission of the deceased's family. When Ray refuses, as he does not want his brother's body to be cut up, Wharton confers with the head of the hospital, Dr. Sam Moreland (Stanley Ridges), about requisitioning an autopsy. Moreland, aware that a scandal over the black doctor's actions could endanger funding, denies the request in the hope that the incident will be forgotten. Upon learning from police records that Johnny was married, Wharton and Luther visit his widow, Edie Johnson (Linda Darnell), who tells the doctors that she divorced Johnny a year and a half ago, and that she hates his whole family. Although she does not reveal it to Wharton, his sympathetic attitude persuades her to visit Ray to ask about the autopsy. Ray tells her, however, that Johnny would be alive if he had had a white doctor, and that Wharton wants to have the autopsy to cover up the truth about Luther's actions. Edie's racist feelings are revived by Ray, with whom she had committed adultery, and he convinces her that Wharton played her for a \\"chump\\", and that she can make up for her past infidelity to Johnny by contacting Beaver Canal club owner Rocky Miller (Bert Freed) and telling him about Johnny's death. Accompanied by Ray's other brother George (Harry Bellaver), who is deaf, Edie goes to the club, where Rocky and his pals lay plans to attack the black section of town, which they call \\"Niggertown\\". Although Edie desperately wishes to leave, Rocky forces her to stay. Meanwhile, Luther arrives at the hospital and learns about the upcoming attack from Lefty Jones (Dots Johnson), a black elevator operator. Luther tries to dissuade Lefty from organizing a counterattack, but Lefty reminds him of a race riot that occurred while Luther was away at school, during which Lefty and his sister were beaten. Luther then contacts Alderman Tompkins to try to avert the riot, while Lefty and a large group of blacks, including Luther's brother-in-law John (Ossie Davis, uncredited), meet and plan their strategy. Edie watches in disgust as the whites prepare their weapons, but leaves before the blacks surprise the whites by attacking first. As victims of the riots are brought in to the hospital, Wharton is called in from home. Before he departs, however, a drunken and disheartened Edie arrives at his house, and Wharton leaves her in the care of his black maid, Gladys (Amanda Randolph). Although Edie fears that Gladys will harm her because of her connection to the riot, Gladys tenderly cares for her when she collapses. At the hospital, Luther tends to the victims until a white woman orders him to take his \\"black hands\\" off her son and spits in his face. Stunned, Luther walks out, and the next morning, after Wharton returns home to find Edie chatting with Gladys, Luther's wife Cora (Mildred Joanne Smith) arrives and announces that Luther has given himself up to the police for the murder of Johnny Biddle. Cora relates that after he left the hospital, Luther realized that the coroner would be forced to conduct an autopsy if he were charged with murder. Wharton assures Cora that he will stand by Luther, and after he leaves with Edie, Cora's stoic demeanor in front of the whites crumbles and she cries in Gladys' arms. Following the autopsy, the coroner confirms that Johnny died of a brain tumor and that Luther was justified in performing the spinal tap. Wharton, Cora and Edie are pleased that Luther has been exonerated, but Ray insists that the doctors are conspiring to bury the truth. Luther leaves with Cora, followed by Edie, who denounces Ray before she departs. After overhearing Wharton tell the coroner that he is leaving town for a much-needed rest, Ray and George overpower the police guard and escape. When Edie returns to her apartment, she finds Ray and George waiting, and Ray, whose leg is bleeding profusely, beats Edie to make her call Luther and tell him to meet Wharton at his house. Drunk and in shock, Ray raves that he is going to kill Luther, then leaves Edie with George. By turning up the volume on her radio, which George does not notice, Edie prompts her neighbors to break down her door, then escapes and calls the hospital prison ward for help. Meanwhile, when Luther enters Wharton's house, Ray holds a gun on him, beats him and shouts racist slurs. Edie arrives and tries to stop Ray from killing Luther, but Ray's physical pain and obsessive hatred have pushed him beyond reason. Edie turns out the lights as Ray shoots at Luther, and although Luther is wounded in the shoulder, he retrieves Ray's gun as he collapses in pain. Edie coldly tells Luther to let Ray's leg bleed, but Luther asserts that he cannot kill Ray simply because of his racism, then uses the gun and Edie's scarf to fashion a tourniquet. As a siren announces the arrival of the police, Luther tells the hysterical Ray, \\"Don't cry, white boy, you're gonna live.\\" Cast * Richard Widmark as Ray Biddle * Linda Darnell as Edie Johnson, Mrs. John Biddle * Stephen McNally as Dr. Dan Wharton * Sidney Poitier as Dr. Luther Brooks * Mildred Joanne Smith as Cora Brooks * Harry Bellaver as George Biddle * Stanley Ridges as Dr. Sam Moreland * Dots Johnson as Lefty Jones, orderly * Amanda Randolph as Gladys (uncredited) * Ossie Davis as John Brooks (uncredited) * Ruby Dee as Connie Brooks (uncredited) * Maude Simmons as Luther's mother (uncredited) See also *List of films featuring the deaf and hard of hearing ReferencesNotesBibliography= * Selby, Spencer.

The phrase \\"N'Ko\\" means \\"I say\\" in all Manding languages. Kanté created N'Ko in 1949 after five years of experimentation with various writing systems. He acted in response to what he felt were beliefs that Africans were a \\"cultureless people\\", as the continent of Africa is diverse, and since there was, prior to this time, no indigenous African writing system for his language. The script first came into use in Kankan, Guinea as a Maninka alphabet and was disseminated from there into other Manding-speaking parts of West Africa. ReferencesSources *Conrad, David C.

He sold raw materials for the production of chemical weapons to Iraq during the reign of Saddam Hussein. In December 2005, a court in The Hague convicted him of complicity in war crimes for his role in selling chemical weapons to Saddam's government. He was given a 15-year sentence.Killing of Iraq Kurds 'genocide' BBC News, 23 December 2005 In 2007, the appeal court sentenced Van Anraat to 17 years in prison. Van Anraat is the only Dutchman ever to appear on the FBI's most wanted list. Business in Iraq In the 1970s, Van Anraat worked at engineering companies in Italy, Switzerland and Singapore that were building chemical plants in Iraq. Having learned about the trade in chemicals, he founded his own company, \\"FCA Contractor\\", based in Bissone, Switzerland. Starting in 1984, he supplied thousands of tons of chemicals to Iraq including the essential raw materials for producing mustard gas and nerve gas. Both gases were used during the Iran–Iraq War, between 1980 and 1988, as well as during the Halabja poison gas attack the military carried out on Iraqi Kurds, in 1988, which killed about 5,000 people. The attack was part of the Al-Anfal campaign of the Iraqi regime against Kurds in the north of the country. Arrest and trial After Van Anraats arrest upon the request of the USA in Italy in 1989, his offices in Switzerland and Italy were searched and documents were confiscated. He was released pending trial and Van Anraat fled to Iraq, where he lived for the next 14 years, was granted the Iraqi nationality and given an Arabic name. When Hussein's regime fell in 2003, Van Anraat returned to the Netherlands. He was arrested on 6 December 2004 for complicity in war crimes and genocide. On 23 December 2005, he was sentenced to 15 years in prison for complicity in war crimes, but the court decided the charges of complicity in genocide could not be substantiated. The court also ruled that the killing of thousands of Kurds in Iraq in the 1980s was an act of genocide. In the 1948 Geneva Convention, the definition of genocide is \\"acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group\\". The Dutch court said that it was considered \\"legally and convincingly proven that the Kurdish population meets the requirement under the Genocide Conventions as an ethnic group. The court has no other conclusion than that these attacks were committed with the intent to destroy the Kurdish population of Iraq.\\" Both the public prosecutor and Van Anraat appealed against the verdict. In May 2007, the appeal court sentenced Van Anraat to 17 years in prison. The charge for complicity in multiple war crimes explains the extra two years, but he was not found guilty for complicity in genocide. In June 2007 the Dutch Supreme Court confirmed the sentence but reduced the imprisonment to 16 years and 6 months. Informant for Dutch secret service Shortly after the arrest of Van Anraat, several Dutch newspapers reported that Van Anraat had been an informant for the Dutch secret service, the AIVD. According to the Dutch press, Van Anraat received protection from the AIVD and was placed in a safehouse of the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations, in Amsterdam.

It was the first album by King Diamond on the Massacre Records label and the last to feature drummer Darrin Anthony. The Graveyard is one of the most successful King Diamond's albums, peaking at No. 23 in the Finnish Charts and remaining for two weeks in the Top 40. The album was remastered by Andy LaRocque and re-released in 2009. Plot In this story, King's character is an employee for a crooked, perverted and immoral mayor, Mayor McKenzie. One night, King's character happens to walk in on his boss molesting his daughter, Lucy. King doesn't keep quiet about this, but the mayor testifies that King is insane and has him locked up in Black Hill Sanitarium. After years of being there, King sees his chance to escape and takes it, strangling the nurse that arrives at his cell to administer his medication and stealing her keys. Now mentally destroyed, King runs off to the local graveyard to hide from the police. King plots his revenge against Mayor McKenzie, and begins killing people who pass through the graveyard at night. King is obsessed with an urban legend that if you die in a graveyard and lose your head, your soul does not escape, and it lives forever in your head. With that thought in the back of his mind, he kidnaps Lucy McKenzie, the mayor's daughter, and calls the mayor out to the graveyard for the two of them to play a game. Eventually, Mayor McKenzie does arrive after King calls him by phone. Before he arrives, King buries Lucy - still conscious - in one of seven empty graves, the tombstones of which read \\"LUCY FOREVER\\". King eventually reveals himself to the Mayor and offers him a game. Mayor must dig out his little daughter from one of seven graves while wearing a blindfold. There are seven mounds, and he'll have three guesses or else he'll kill both of them. The Mayor gets the third guess right, but King knocks him out, dragging him to his tomb and tying him down. While the Mayor slowly regains consciousness, King digs up Lucy and takes her out of the coffin while he starts to torture the Mayor. To King's surprise, Lucy ends up pulling down on a cord that sends a sheet of broken glass from a broken chapel window down on King, decapitating him. The urban legend King was obsessed with turns out to be true, as his living head beckons Lucy not to leave him as she walks away with her father. To his relief, Lucy takes King's head and puts it in her backpack, so King can be with her forever.Lyrics: http://www.darklyrics.com/lyrics/kingdiamond/thegraveyard.html Track listingCredits *King Diamond - All Vocals, Keyboards *Andy LaRocque - Guitars *Herb Simonsen - Guitars *Chris Estes - Bass *Darrin Anthony - Drums References Category:King Diamond albums Category:1996 albums Category:Concept albums Category:Rock operas Category:Massacre Records albums ","title":"The Graveyard (album)"},{"id":"1618968","text":"Joplings was a department store, located in Sunderland, England, which was part of the former Vergo Retail Ltd. group of department stores. History The store was established in 1804 by James Jopling and soon he went into partnership with Joseph Tuer. In 1891 the business was bought by Hedley, Swan & Co as a drapery, clothing and furniture warehouse. Hedley, Swan & Co continued to use the Jopling and Tuer name as it was well known, and after expanding the store to 173-177 High Street, they bought rival department store J T Calvert and moved Joplings to this new site at 126-129 High Street West. In December 1954 the store burnt down and operated from temporary space until its present purpose-built building opened in 1956. As flames ripped through Joplings on 13 December 1954, 100 firefighters battled to save the 150-year- old store. By morning, however, just rubble remained – along with a sign proclaiming 'Santa Claus is here today.' Joplings, a shopping institution since 1804, was at the height of its busy Christmas season when disaster struck. Such was the scale of the inferno that the fiery glow from the High Street building could be seen for 20 miles around. \\"Narrow streets became valleys of heat, driving back the firefighters, with masonry collapsing on hose pipes,\\" a reporter at the scene later recalled. \\"The worst moment came when firemen playing their hoses on the front of the store suddenly realised the building on the opposite side of the road had also taken fire. \\"Within seconds, they were at the centre of a ring of fire.\\" But as masonry crashed into the street, and girders twisted in the heat, the brave firemen battled on – sadly in vain. \\"The intense heat could be felt by onlookers 80 yards away,\\" the reporter revealed. \\"By 2am flames were tearing through the roof and the interior glowed like a furnace. \\"The next day, all that remained was the shell if the building. It was Sunderland's biggest fire of the century.\\" Within a week, however, local storekeepers helped to put Joplings back in business, by offering accommodation for the different departments at premises throughout the town. Just six weeks later a temporary store was opened at the old High Street site and, within 18 months, a new Joplings was built in John Street. In early 2005 the store was purchased from its previous owners, Merchant Retail Group plc, together with Robbs of Hexham, by Liverpool-based Owen Owen Ltd., for £5 million and another £3 million for stock. On 18 May 2007, it was announced that a newly formed company, Vergo Retail, had taken over the three remaining Owen Owen stores. Vergo Retail was spearheaded by David Thompson, a former director of Mothercare, Habitat and more recently director and shareholder of Mark One which was sold in 2004 for £55m. Other departments include Sound & Vision, Wines & Spirits and The Christmas Department.\\"Historic shops sold in £5m deal\\". BBC News (bbc.co.uk). 2005-01-19. http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/4187745.stm. Retrieved 2007-03-17 On 7 May 2010, Vergo was placed into administration, with MCR appointed as the administrators. On 11 May 2010, it was announced that there would be ten store closures, including Joplings, within the next four weeks unless a buyer was found. A final closure date of Saturday 19 June 2010 has now been set. In September 2017, planning permission was granted for the building to be turned into a purpose built student accommodation. Groovy Students Student Accommodation renovated the entire building to create 114 rooms for students and 4 commercial units on the ground floor. Spokesman Steven Kwan from 5 Star PR Marketing, a PR Marketing agency in Newcastle said \\"Joplings is a Sunderland institution which goes back decades and it was such a shame when it went into administration in 2010. \\"It would be such a shame for all that history to be lost, but we’ve managed to keep some of it, such as with the name. The public reaction to the site is so strong that the name Jopling House was a no brainer for us so that we could carry that legacy on.\\" On 2 January 2019, Joplings Department store opened its doors for the first time in 9 years as Jopling House.

The sleepers finds out the little girls were not what they appeared to be and screams to escape the nightmare. ;\\"Moonlight\\" Tells about a group of cursed children, similar to the 1960 movie Village of the Damned. ;\\"Six Feet Under\\" It is an alternate chapter — a cutscene from Conspiracy and references from \\"Them\\" telling what would have happened differently if King's mother and his sociopath therapist Doctor Landau had buried him alive in a glass coffin so they (along with his family) could watch him suffer in agony and perish, while his sister Missy kicks dirt in his face, laughing at his pain. His \\"family\\" mentioned in the song are: Grandma, King's mother, his sister Missy, his grandfather, etc. ;\\"The Spider's Lullabye\\" Focuses on a reclusive man named Harry who is terrified of spiders and, out of desperation, finds a doctor who can cure his arachnophobia. ;\\"Eastmann's Cure\\" Is the continuing plot of Harry answering an ad in the local newspaper about a psychiatric hospital that specializes in curing phobias of all kinds. The second character in the song Dr. Eastmann introduces himself to Harry as a kind, friendly physician who hides his true intentions. ;\\"Room 17\\" In \\"Room 17\\", a confident Harry awaits Dr. Eastmann and his assistant Nurse Needle Dear to begin his treatment and cure. The so-called \\"treatment\\" was nothing more than a torture session when Nurse Needle unleashes a wolf spider from the \\"Crawly Box\\". The next day, Harry complains of having a weird feeling on his neck, spider bites and intense pain. Dr. Eastmann dismisses Harry's comments and thinks nothing more of it. The same night, when Harry is discovered by staff, they find him long dead and covered from head to toe in a spider web-like cocoon giving evidence that a series of spiders have wrapped him up like a fly, saving his dead body for consumption. Dr. Eastmann comes to the realization that Harry had clearly died of fright (possibly from the result of a heart attack), when Harry (who is now reduced to bones and skin) is taken. ;\\"To the Morgue\\" Along with other patients who have died for reasons unknown, spiders begin making their home in his empty eye sockets.

It was released in 1987 via Roadrunner Records. There were several re-releases, first in 1997 with four bonus tracks, and then a 25th anniversary edition in 2005 with a bonus DVD. The album has sold over 175,000 copies in North America alone. Abigail is the last album to feature guitarist Michael Denner and bassist Timi Hansen. Plot Abigail tells the story of a young couple, Miriam Natias and Jonathan La'Fey, who move into an old mansion that La'Fey inherited. It takes place in the summer of 1845. At their arrival they are warned by seven horsemen not to move into the house because if they do \\"18 will become 9.\\" They do not heed the warning and proceed to move into the mansion. During their first night, Jonathan meets with Count de La'Fey, the Family Ghost, who is a deceased relative. The ghost shows him a casket in which a corpse of a stillborn child, Abigail, rests. The ghost informs him that Miriam is carrying the spirit of Abigail and that the child will soon be reborn. He insists that Jonathan must kill Miriam at once to prevent the rebirth. The narration then relates the story of what happened to the Count and his wife: on 7 July 1777, the Count had discovered his wife had been unfaithful to him, and was pregnant with an illegitimate child. Enraged, he threw the Countess down the stairs, breaking her neck and causing the child to be stillborn. The Count had the body of the Countess cremated, and the stillborn fetus he named Abigail and had mummified and laid to rest in a sarcophagus, the Count having an inexplicable urge to preserve Abigail for the future. The narration then returns to the summer of 1845, during which Jonathan and Miriam are beset by a range of omens; the church bell rings despite nobody being inside to ring it, flowers die, unwholesome stenches fill the house and in the dining room the table is discovered set for 3. In one incident an empty cradle is discovered by Jonathan swaying in the air, with both him and Miriam insisting that they didn't bring it with them. The next day, Miriam is clearly pregnant and the fetus develops quickly; Jonathan realises that the family ghost was speaking the truth. The fatal crisis begins when Jonathan accuses Abigail of possessing Miriam, and Abigail (through Miriam) admits it. Jonathan is terrified and considers getting a priest to exorcise Miriam - Miriam, however, exercising a moment of control, urges him to cast her down the stairs to kill her just as the Count had slain the Countess and Abigail's original incarnation. Therefore, Jonathan pretends to give in to Abigail's demands, and suggests to Abigail (once she regains control of Miriam) that she should come down to the family crypt so she can be reborn where she died. However, as the couple stands at the top of the stairs, Jonathan is distracted and the possessed Miriam pushes Jonathan down the stairs. Miriam gives birth to Abigail, but dies shortly afterwards, her last sight being of Abigail's \\"yellow eyes\\"; supposedly her ghost can be heard screaming on the stairs in July ever after. The seven horsemen arrive at the mansion and discover the baby Abigail in the sarcophagus, eating something too horrifying for the narrator to mention (though the fact that it is found in the sarcophagus suggests that Abigail is eating her own previous body). Appalled, they take her away to bury her in a hidden chapel in the forest with seven silver spikes driven through her body (a burial heard as the intro to the album), in the hope that this will prevent a further resurrection.

A sphaleron ( \\"slippery\\") is a static (time-independent) solution to the electroweak field equations of the Standard Model of particle physics, and is involved in certain hypothetical processes that violate baryon and lepton numbers. Such processes cannot be represented by perturbative methods such as Feynman diagrams, and are therefore called non-perturbative. Geometrically, a sphaleron is a saddle point of the electroweak potential (in infinite- dimensional field space). This saddle point rests at the top of a barrier between two different low-energy equilibria of a given system; the two equilibria are labeled with two different baryon numbers. One of the equilibria might consist of three baryons; the other, alternative, equilibrium for the same system might consist of three antileptons. In order to cross this barrier and change the baryon number, a system must either tunnel through the barrier (in which case the process is a type of instanton process) or must for a reasonable period of time be brought up to a high enough energy that it can classically cross over the barrier (in which case the process is termed a \\"sphaleron\\" process and can be modeled with an eponymous sphaleron particle). In both the instanton and sphaleron cases, the process can only convert groups of three baryons into three antileptons (or three antibaryons into three leptons) and vice versa. This violates conservation of baryon number and lepton number, but the difference B − L is conserved. The minimum energy required to trigger the sphaleron process is believed to be around 10 TeV; however, sphalerons cannot be produced in existing LHC collisions, because although the LHC can create collisions of energy 10 TeV and greater, the generated energy cannot be concentrated in a manner that would create sphalerons. A sphaleron is similar to the midpoint of the instanton, so it is non-perturbative. This means that under normal conditions sphalerons are unobservably rare. However, they would have been more common at the higher temperatures of the early universe.  Baryogenesis  Since a sphaleron may convert baryons to antileptons and antibaryons to leptons and thus change the baryon number, if the density of sphalerons was at some stage high enough, they could wipe out any net excess of baryons or anti-baryons. This has two important implications in any theory of baryogenesis within the Standard Model: * Any baryon net excess arising before the electroweak symmetry breaking would be wiped out due to abundant sphalerons caused by high temperatures existing in the early universe. * While a baryon net excess can be created during the electroweak symmetry breaking, it can be preserved only if this phase transition was first-order. This is because in a second-order phase transition, sphalerons would wipe out any baryon asymmetry as it is created, while in a first-order phase transition, sphalerons would wipe out baryon asymmetry only in the unbroken phase. In absence of processes which violate B − L it is possible for an initial baryon asymmetry to be protected if it has a non-zero projection onto B − L. In this case the sphaleron processes would impose an equilibrium which distributes the initial B asymmetry between both B and L numbers. In some theories of baryogenesis, an imbalance of the number of leptons and antileptons is formed first by leptogenesis and sphaleron transitions then convert this to an imbalance in the numbers of baryons and antibaryons.  Details  For an SU(2) gauge theory, neglecting \\\\theta_W, we have the following equations for the gauge field and the Higgs field in the gauge A_0 = A_r = 0 :: \\\\mathbf{A} = u\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\,f(\\\\xi)\\\\,}{\\\\xi}~\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{r}}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{\\\\sigma} \\\\, , \\\\qquad \\\\phi = \\\\frac{ u}{\\\\,\\\\sqrt{2\\\\,}\\\\,}~h(\\\\xi)~\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{r}}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{\\\\sigma}~\\\\phi_0 where ~\\\\xi = r\\\\,g\\\\, u~, ~\\\\phi_0 = \\\\begin{bmatrix}1  0\\\\end{bmatrix}~, the symbols ~\\\\sigma represent the generators of SU(2), ~g~ is the electroweak coupling constant, and ~ u~ is the Higgs VEV absolute value. The functions ~h(\\\\xi)~ and ~f(\\\\xi)~, which must be determined numerically, go from 0 to 1 in value as their argument, ~\\\\xi~, goes from 0 to \\\\infty. For a sphaleron in the background of a non-broken phase, the Higgs field must obviously fall off eventually to zero as ~\\\\xi~ goes to infinity. Note that in the limit \\\\xi \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty, the gauge sector approaches one of the pure-gauge transformation \\\\frac{~\\\\mathbf{r} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{\\\\sigma}~}{ r }, which is the same as the pure gauge transformation to which the BPST instanton approaches as r \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty at t = 0, hence establishing the connection between the sphaleron and the instanton. Baryon number violation is caused by the \\"winding\\" of the fields from one equilibrium to another. Each time the weak gauge fields wind, the count for each of the quark families and each of the lepton families is raised (or lowered, depending on the winding direction) by one; as there are three quark families, baryon number can only change in multiples of three. The baryon number violation can alternatively be visualized in terms of a kind of Dirac sea: in the course of the winding, a baryon originally considered to be part of the vacuum is now considered a real baryon, or vice versa, and all the other baryons stacked inside the sea are accordingly shifted by one energy level. Energy release According to physicist Max Tegmark, the theoretical energy efficiency from conversion of baryons to antileptons would be orders of magnitude higher than the energy efficiency of existing power-generation technology such as nuclear fusion. Tegmark speculates that an extremely advanced civilization might use a \\"sphalerizer\\" to generate energy from ordinary baryonic matter.

This occurs when the turgor pressure in non-lignified plant cells falls towards zero, as a result of diminished water in the cells. Wilting also serves to reduce water loss, as it makes the leaves expose less surface area. The rate of loss of water from the plant is greater than the absorption of water in the plant. The process of wilting modifies the leaf angle distribution of the plant (or canopy) towards more erectophile conditions. Lower water availability may result from: * drought conditions, where the soil moisture drops below conditions most favorable for plant functioning; * the temperature falls to the point where the plant's vascular system cannot function; * high salinity, which causes water to diffuse from the plant cells and induce shrinkage; * saturated soil conditions, where roots are unable to obtain sufficient oxygen for cellular respiration, and so are unable to transport water into the plant; or * bacteria or fungi that clog the plant's vascular system. Wilting diminishes the plant's ability to transpire and grow. Permanent wilting leads to plant death. Symptoms of wilting and blights resemble one another. The plants may recover during the night when evaporation is reduced as the stomata closes. In woody plants, reduced water availability leads to cavitation of the xylem. Wilting occurs in plants such as balsam and holy basil. Wilting is an effect of the plant growth-inhibiting hormone, abscisic acid. With cucurbits, wilting can be caused by the squash vine borer.

It continues to feature a major storyline like other King Diamond albums, though it is told differently. The Eye is the only album to feature drummer Snowy Shaw and the last to feature guitarist Pete Blakk and bassist Hal Patino, until the latter's return on Abigail II: The Revenge. Plot His two prior concept albums had been told from the perspective of the protagonists; this one is told from the view of a narrator. The themes of Christian atrocity with the persecution of alleged witches and sexual abuse against nuns are present. The story starts off with an unnamed character finding a necklace called \\"The Eye\\", that allows him/her to see the events the necklace was witness for in the past. They see an accused witch named Jeanne Dibasson being tortured and burned at the stake. Next they see two little girls finding the necklace in the ashes at a stake, and what they see when they look in the eye kills them. Finally there is the story of Madeleine Bavent, a nun working in the Louviers convent, who finds the necklace and decides to put it on. After being raped by Father David, she uses the necklace to kill him by making him look into it. Shortly after, the new Chaplain, Father Picard, arrives and starts bringing everyone to communion. He winds up lacing their communion wine with some substance that lets him control their minds, and uses a group of nuns including Madeleine to ritually torture and kill children. In 1642 all are arrested and imprisoned. The main parts of the stories told on this album are true, and took place during the French Inquisition, 1450–1670. All of the following characters are real and from that period of time: # Nicolas de la Reynie (spelled \\"Nicholas de La Reymie\\" in the lyrics): Head investigator of the Christian Burning Court (Chambre Ardente), in Paris, France. # Jeanne Dibasson: Supposed witch. # Madeleine Bavent: 18-year-old French nun who entered the convent at Louviers in 1625, after having been seduced by a priest.

He was considered one of the most loved horses in the history of horse racing in the UK,Death of Best Mate with his sudden death while racing making front-page news. Background The horse was owned by Jim Lewis and trained by Henrietta Knight. He was sired by Un Desperado, a French stallion who won the Prix Eugène Adam in 1986. In 2000 a share of 40% was sold to Markus Jooste for the sum of £242,000 Racing career Best Mate won the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 2002, 2003, and 2004 with jockey Jim Culloty, matching the record of Arkle, but was withdrawn from the 2005 race eight days before the event due to bursting a blood vessel on the gallops. He also missed the 2001 festival due to the foot and mouth crisis where he was the favourite for the Arkle Challenge Trophy. He won the 2002 King George VI Chase and the 2003 Ericsson Chase. Best Mate never fell at a fence or hurdle. Out of 22 starts, he came first in 14 of them and second in seven, the 22nd race being the one he was pulled up in shortly before his death. Of the seven races in which he finished second, five were Group 1 races, and two were Group 2 races. Like Arkle, Best Mate won three successive Cheltenham Gold Cups. He ran in one handicap chase (2001/2002 First National Gold Cup), where he failed by 1/2 length to give 20 lbs to Wahiba Sands. He was the first horse to win the Gold Cup more than once since L'Escargot in 1970 and 1971. Death Best Mate at his last race shortly before his death on 1 November 2005 Best Mate collapsed and died of a suspected heart attack after being pulled up by jockey Paul Carberry whilst competing in the William Hill Haldon Gold Cup at Exeter Racecourse on 1 November 2005. After the jockey dismounted, the horse stumbled and went onto his knees. Best Mate's death was national news, with headlines including Who can fill the void left by Best Mate?, Best Mate leaves golden memories after giving his all for final time, Heartbreak at Exeter as Best Mate collapses and dies and Perfect horse Best Mate dies at trainer's feet. Government regulations prevented the burial of his body on the Exeter course as Lewis and many racing fans desired. Instead Best Mate was cremated, and his ashes were buried beside the winning post at Cheltenham Racecourse on 10 December 2005. Lewis was in attendance even though his wife, Valerie, had died on 8 December after a 7-month battle against cancer. Assessment and honours The highest Timeform rating for Arkle was 212, while Best Mate's highest rating was 182. Timeform themselves felt that Best Mate's rating could have been higher if he had raced in more handicaps. There is now a bronze statue in memory to Best Mate near the farm at which he was trained in Lockinge. At the Cheltenham Festival the following year, a statue of Best Mate was revealed.

It has been declared one of the state songs of Louisiana because of its association with Davis, a country music singer and governor of the state in the years 1944–1948 and 1960–1964. The song has been recorded numerous times — so often, in fact, that it is \\"one of the most commercially programmed numbers in American popular music.\\" The song, originally country music, has \\"virtually lost\\" its original country music identity, and \\"represent[s] both the national flowering of country music and its eventual absorption into the mainstream of American popular culture.\\" In 1941, it was recorded by Gene Autry, Bing Crosby, Mississippi John Hurt, Wayne King and Lawrence Welk. The versions by Autry, Crosby, and King reached the US charts of the day. In subsequent years, it was recorded by Doris Day (1951), Nat King Cole (1955), The Marcels (1961), Ray Charles (1962), Ike & Tina Turner, The Rivingtons (1962), Andy Williams (1963), Burl Ives (1968), Frank Turner, The Beach Boys, Aretha Franklin, Anne Murray (1979), Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, Norman Blake, Brian Wilson, Mouse and the Traps, Gene Vincent, Jamey Johnson, Low, Mose Allison, Bryan Ferry, Carly Simon, Papa Winnie (1989), Madeline Eastman, Yusuf Islam, Copeland, Johnny and the Hurricanes, and Barbra Lica (2012), amongst many others.

Authorship According to Theodore Pappas, in a November 1990 article in Chronicles Magazine, the author was Oliver Hood of LaGrange, Georgia. Whereas Davis and Mitchell are usually credited songwriters of \\"You Are My Sunshine\\", Davis was never known actually to claim authorship, as he bought the song and rights from Paul Rice and put his own name on it, a practice not uncommon in the pre-World War II music business, though some early versions of the song credit it to the Rice Brothers. Descendants and associates of Oliver Hood, a LaGrange, Georgia, musician who collaborated with Rice, state that Hood wrote the song in the early 1930s and first performed it at a Veterans of Foreign Wars convention at LaGrange, Georgia, in 1933. According to OffBeat magazine, clarinetist Pud Brown was also involved with the Rice Brothers for the song's origin or first arrangement. Davis said that for some time he had been enthusiastic about the song and had unsuccessfully tried to convince record companies to record it before finally making his own 1940 record of the song. Davis' version was popular and was followed by numerous other versions, including those of Bing Crosby and Gene Autry, whose versions made the number a big hit.

The abortive revolutionary insurrection inspired by William Lyon Mackenzie was crushed by British authorities and Canadian volunteer units near a tavern on Yonge Street, Toronto. The site of Montgomery's Tavern was designated a National Historic Site in 1925.  Prelude  When the Lower Canada Rebellion broke out in the fall of 1837, Sir Francis Bond Head sent the British troops stationed in Toronto (formerly York) to help suppress it. With the regular troops gone, William Lyon Mackenzie and his followers seized a Toronto armoury and organized an armed march down Yonge Street, beginning at Montgomery's Tavern (on Yonge St just north of Eglinton Avenue – the present- day site of Postal Station K) on December 4, 1837. While marching down Yonge Street, Mackenzie and some fellow rebels encountered John Powell and Archibald McDonald while attempting to scout the city. Upon meeting them, Mackenzie took Powell prisoner and sent them to Montgomery's Tavern. Although there were concerns over whether Powell and McDonald possessed arms, Mackenzie accepted their denials and said, \\"well, gentlemen, as you are my townsmen, and men of honor, I would be ashamed to show that I question your words by ordering you to be searched.\\"Mackenzie, William Lyon. Mackenzie's Own Narrative of the Late Rebellion, With Illustrations and Notes, Critical and Explanatory: Exhibiting the Only True Account of What Took Place at the Memorable Siege of Toronto in the Month of December of 1837. Toronto: Pallandium Office, 1838. Pg. 9-10, https://archive.org/stream/cihm_34462#page/n5/mode/1up. Despite such assurances, Powell had hidden a pistol and shot rebel Captain Anthony Anderson before escaping back to Toronto, thereby dealing a large blow to the rebel's military expertise.Read, D.B. The Canadian Rebellion of 1837. Toronto: C. Blackett Robinson, 1896. Pg. 303-304. Robert Moodie was fatally shot outside of Montgomery's Tavern in an attempt to lead loyalists through the roadblock. Colonel Robert Moodie attempted to lead a force of loyalists through the rebel roadblock to warn Governor Bond Head in Toronto. Moodie fired his pistol, apparently in an attempt to clear the way. A number of the rebels returned fire, killing him. On the same day, December 5, Mackenzie's approximately 500 rebels marched upon Toronto's city hall in an effort to seize the arms and ammunition that were stored there. As Mackenzie and his forces marched towards Toronto, Bond Head sent a flag of truce and asked for their demands, to which Mackenzie demanded \\"Independence and a convention to arrange details.\\" By the time Mackenzie and his followers had reached College Street, Bond Head sent another party to tell Mackenzie that his demands had been rejected.Lindsey, Charles. The Life and Times of William Lyon Mackenzie; With an Account of the Canadian Rebellion of 1837, and the Subsequent Frontier Disturbances, Chiefly from Unpublished Documents. Volume II. Toronto: P.R. Randall, 1862. Pg. 81-86. https://archive.org/stream/lifetimesofwilli02linduoft#page/n7/mode/2up. Later that afternoon, Mackenzie led his troops farther down Yonge Street towards the city, where their advance was stopped by a party of 27 loyalist volunteers, led by William Botsford Jarvis. The two sides exchanged gunfire. Jarvis' loyalist troops fired a volley at Egmond's gang and dropped to reload. Thinking the loyalist soldiers had been killed, Van Egmond gave the order to charge and in the ensuing melee many of the rebel soldiers fled or deserted the group. That night, reinforcements for the loyalists arrived from Hamilton. By the next day, these forces were 1,500 strong. The last real engagement prior to the Battle of Montgomery's Tavern occurred on December 6 via a raid on a mail coach which was suspected to have government intelligence regarding future actions towards the rebels. It was from this raid that the rebels learned of government plans to soon attack Montgomery's Tavern.Lindsey, Charles. The Life and Times of William Lyon Mackenzie; With an Account of the Canadian Rebellion of 1837, and the Subsequent Frontier Disturbances, Chiefly from Unpublished Document. Volume II. Toronto: P.R. Randall, 1862. Pg. 91. https://archive.org/stream/lifetimesofwilli02linduoft#page/n7/mode/2up.  Montgomery's Tavern  The rebels, now under the command of Napoleonic Wars veteran Anthony Van Egmond, had regrouped at Montgomery's Tavern. One hundred and fifty were posted in the woods behind the tavern (on the west side of Yonge Street) and another 60 took up positions behind a line of rail fencing (on the East side of Yonge Street). The majority of Mackenzie's supporters, numbering about 300, were gathered around the tavern proper. These were largely unarmed and would offer little resistance when pressed. On December 7, Colonel James Fitzgibbon marched an estimated 1,000 regulars and militiamen up Yonge Street and attacked Mackenzie's force at Montgomery's Tavern, putting the building under artillery fire.\\"December 7, 1837: Battle of Montgomery's Tavern\\". Toronto Star, Brennan Doherty, Dec. 2, 2016 When Fitzgibbon advanced his infantry, both parties of rebels abandoned their posts and retreated in disarray to the tavern, causing those assembled there to panic and flee. Within 20 minutes, the rebels were gone. Loyalist forces then looted the tavern and burned it to the ground, before marching back to York.  Post rebellion and site today  Following the rebellion, the site of the tavern was used to build a hotel, with the structure of the old Davisville Hotel. In 1858 it was sold to hotelier Charles McBride of Willowdale (1832–?), who renamed the tavern Prospect House. The tavern would serve as Masonic Lodge and North Toronto township council office. McBride sold the hotel in 1873 to build another hotel, Bedford Park Hotel, on Yonge Street. Prospect House burned down in 1881, and the vacant land was sold to proprietor (and later as hotelier) John Oulcott of Toronto, who rebuilt a three-storey Oulcott's Hotel (Eglinton House) in 1883. Oulcott sold out in 1912 and the hotel went to various owners. In 1913, the federal government purchased the hotel and remodelled the old hotel as a post office for the North Toronto postal district. It was finally torn down in the 1930s to be replaced by the current structure. The site of the tavern is now occupied by a two-storey Art Deco post office designed by Murray Brown and built in 1936. The building, Postal Station K, bears the cypher EviiiR, for Edward VIII, King of Canada for eleven months in 1936; it is one of a few buildings to bear this mark in Toronto. As of spring 2016, construction is underway to incorporate the post office into a new building which will include retail space and podium for the 27-storey Montgomery Square luxury rental apartment building.

It controlled about 70% of Russia's installed electric capacity, 96% of its high-voltage grid and over 70% of its transmission lines. In addition to the Russian market, RAO UES exported electricity to Scandinavia and to other members of the CIS. The last head of RAO UES was Anatoly Chubais. History Unified Energy System of Russia was established by Presidential Decree #932, signed on August 15, 1992, as an electric energy holding company. Most of the state-owned electric energy assets, such as thermal and hydroelectric power plants, transmission lines, state-owned shares in power, research & engineering, and construction companies were transferred to RAO UES, with the exception of any assets related to nuclear energy. In total, RAO UES owned more than 70 of the energy companies and more than 40 of the power plants with federal-level importance. It also owned the transmission system operator, Federal Grid Company, (or, RAO FGC, the current successor of RAO UES and the operator of Russia's wide area transmission network) and the system operator of the Centralized Dispatching Administration (OAO SO-CDA). The first head of the company was Anatoly Dyakov, who held the positions of President and Chairman of the Directors Council.РАО ЕЭС России. Некоторые сведения On May 30, 1997, shareholders abolished the position of President and appointed a Chairman of the Board, Boris Brevnov, who was a personal friend of First Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Boris Nemtsov. On January 27, 1998, the Director's Council, headed by Anatoly Dyakov, removed Brevnov from his position. However, Brevnov did not recognize this action and removed Dyakov from his position instead. Eventually, former Chief of the Russian presidential administration, Anatoly Chubais, was appointed Chairman of the Board; and the Chief of the Russian presidential administration, Alexander Voloshin, was appointed Chairman of the Directors Council (25 June 1999). In mid 2000s, RAO UES suffered several failures in trying to keep up with demand. These were due to the decade-long practice of disinvestment. The most significant failures were the 2005 Moscow power blackouts. Reorganization The reorganization of RAO UES started in 2006. The first stage of the reorganization was completed on September 3, 2007, during which subsidiary generating companies, WGC-5 and TGC-5, were individually spun off from the parent RAO UES. During a second stage of reorganization, all remaining subsidiaries of RAO UES were spun off (by July 1, 2008). This reorganization was seen as a massive privatization of the power industry, with the goal of attaining about US$79 billion in investments. As a result, RAO UES ceased to exist after its merger into UES FGC, a Federal Grid Company. Altogether, six wholesale generation companies (WGC), 14 territorial generation companies (TGC), RusHydro, FGC UES (Federal Grid Company), SO-CDA (System Operator), IDC Holding, RAO ES of the East, and Inter RAO UES continue to operate as independent entities. Shareholders The Russian Federation owned directly, or indirectly, over 50% of the shares in RAO UES. The rest of the stock was owned by minority shareholders. Shares were also traded on the MICEX and RTS stock exchanges.

Early years Manuel Monteiro started his political life during his youth. He was elected president of the People's Youth (then called Centrist Youth) in 1986. Political career He was the winning candidate of the internal elections of March 1992 in the Democratic and Social Centre, moving the party from the traditional centrist base to the right. His political platform was against a Federal Europe, the Maastricht Treaty and the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union. In 1995 he changed the party's name to People's Party. The renamed party won 9% of the popular vote and 15 deputies, at the legislative elections held on 1 October 1995. This represented a partial comeback for the party that had been comprehensively defeated in the elections of 1987 and 1991. Heavy losses in the local elections of 1997, however, led Monteiro to resign., being succeeded by Paulo Portas, his former friend and protégé. Manuel Monteiro left People's Party in 2002, following a disagreement with Paulo Portas. In June 2003 he founded the New Democracy Party (PND; Partido da Nova Democracia in Portuguese). This new political force never achieved major electoral successes, and Monteiro left the party leadership in November 2008, resigning from its membership two years later. Since then he has been politically inactive. Professional and academic career Manuel Monteiro is a licenciate in Law from the Catholic University of Portugal.

It is a member of the territorial game family, a distant relative of Go and chess. El Juego de las Amazonas (The Game of the Amazons) is a trademark of Ediciones de Mente. The Game of the Amazons is played on a 10x10 chessboard (or an international checkerboard). Some players prefer to use a monochromatic board. The two players are White and Black; each player has four amazons (not to be confused with the amazon fairy chess piece), which start on the board in the configuration shown at right. A supply of markers (checkers, poker chips, etc.) is also required.  Rules  White moves first, and the players alternate moves thereafter. Each move consists of two parts. First, one moves one of one's own amazons one or more empty squares in a straight line (orthogonally or diagonally), exactly as a queen moves in chess; it may not cross or enter a square occupied by an amazon of either color or an arrow. Second, after moving, the amazon shoots an arrow from its landing square to another square, using another queenlike move. This arrow may travel in any orthogonal or diagonal direction (even backwards along the same path the amazon just traveled, into or across the starting square if desired). An arrow, like an amazon, cannot cross or enter a square where another arrow has landed or an amazon of either color stands. The square where the arrow lands is marked to show that it can no longer be used. The last player to be able to make a move wins. Draws are impossible.  Territory and scoring  The strategy of the game is based on using arrows (as well as one's four amazons) to block the movement of the opponent's amazons and gradually wall off territory, trying to trap the opponents in smaller regions and gain larger areas for oneself. Each move reduces the available playing area, and eventually each amazon finds itself in a territory blocked off from all other amazons. The amazon can then move about its territory firing arrows until it no longer has any room to move. Since it would be tedious to actually play out all these moves, in practice the game usually ends when all of the amazons are in separate territories. The player with the largest amount of territory will be able to win, as the opponent will have to fill in her own territory more quickly. Scores are sometimes used for tie-breaking purposes in Amazons tournaments. When scoring, it is important to note that although the number of moves remaining to a player is usually equal to the number of empty squares in the territories occupied by that player's amazons, it is nonetheless possible to have defective territories in which there are fewer moves left than there are empty squares. The simplest such territory is three squares of the same colour, not in a straight line, with the amazon in the middle (for example, a1+b2+c1 with the amazon at b2).  History  El Juego de las Amazonas was first published in Spanish in the Argentine puzzle magazine El Acertijo in December 1992. An approved English translation written by Michael Keller appeared in World Game Review in January 1994. Other game publications also published the rules, and the game gathered a small but devoted following. The Internet spread the game more widely. Michael Keller wrote the first known computer version of the game in VAX Fortran in 1994,. and an updated version with graphics in Visual Basic in 1995. There are Amazons tournaments at the Computer Olympiad, a series of computer-versus-computer competitions.  Computational complexity  Usually, in the endgame, the board is partitioned into separate \\"royal chambers\\", with queens inside each chamber. We define simple Amazons endgames to be endgames where each chamber has at most one queen. Determining who wins in a simple Amazons endgame is NP-hard.. This is proved by reducing it to finding the Hamiltonian path of a cubic subgraph of the square grid graph. Generalized Amazons (that is, determining the winner of a game of Amazons played on a n x n grid, started from an arbitrary configuration) is PSPACE-complete... This can be proved in two ways. The first is by reducing a generalized Hex position, which is known to be PSPACE- complete, into an Amazons position. The second is by reducing a certain kind of generalized geography called GEOGRAPHY-BP3, which is PSPACE-complete, to an Amazons position. This Amazons position uses only one black queen and one white queen, thus showing that generalized Amazons is PSPACE-complete even if only one queen on each side is allowed.

They also had manufacturing facilities in Ironton, Ohio, and in Ireland.  History  Cabletron was founded in 1983 in a Massachusetts garage by Craig Benson (who later became New Hampshire's governor) and Robert Levine.http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/chmn-craig-benson-ceo- robert-levine-of-cabletron-systems-nh-news-photo/50433396 As manufacturing and design operations expanded, Cabletron relocated to Rochester, New Hampshire, employing 6,600 people at its peak. In 1996 the company eclipsed US$1 billion in sales. Cabletron found its first success in the 10BASE5 Ethernet market, providing the ST-500, the first Ethernet transceiver that featured diagnostic LEDs, and the LAN-MD, the first commercially viable field-deployable 10BASE5 test set. The early products were critical in the history of Ethernet as 10BASE5 Ethernet was generally difficult to operate and maintain and cabling problems were especially difficult to diagnose. Following on this early success, Cabletron developed one of the first modular Ethernet hubs, the MMAC-8 (and its smaller siblings, the MMAC-5 and the MMAC-3) at the time that 10BASE-T was becoming standardized. By developing high-density 10BASE-T modules (24 or 48 ports per slot), Cabletron was able to reduce the price per port of these hubs to a very affordable level, and by introducing a custom Element Management System known as Prism, made the MMAC-8 easy to maintain. As Cabletron expanded its reach in the networking business, they initially moved into Layer 3 routing by partnering with Cisco, co-developing a Cisco router that would fit into the MMAC-8 hub. Cabletron ultimately developed its own routing capability, but found it increasingly difficult to compete at the low end of the Ethernet market and continue to invest in high-end routing technology. Recognizing this fact, Cabletron reorganized as a holding company in 2000, hoping to apply appropriate focus to the different parts of its business as they had evolved over time. The holding company was set up to control four networking firms: 1\\\\. Enterasys Networks of Andover, Massachusetts, which was based on the original core products of Cabletron. Enterasys later merged with Cabletron Systems the holding company, though keeping the Enterasys name, before going public in 2001. Subsequently, Enterasys was taken private in 2006 by The Gores Group, which is owned by Alec Gores. In 2008, The Gores Group acquired a controlling interest in Siemens Enterprise Communications and merged the acquired company with Enterasys, pledging with Siemens to invest up to €350M in the new entity. 2\\\\. Riverstone Networks of Santa Clara, California, which was based on the assets of YAGO Systems, a company acquired by Cabletron as an attempt to move into the Switched Ethernet business. Riverstone Networks was the only actual spin-off of Cabletron's reorganization, and it was later acquired by Lucent Technologies, which in turn subsequently merged with Alcatel Networks. This final merger resulted in Riverstone assets becoming redundant with Lucent products and technologies, causing Alcatel-Lucent to wind down Riverstone Networks operations. Eventually, Riverstone was placed into Chapter 11 bankruptcy and liquidated. 3\\\\. Aprisma Management Technologies of Durham, New Hampshire (a subsidiary of Enterasys following the Cabletron paper merger). Aprisma held most of the original Cabletron network management technologies that were based on the SPECTRUM software suite (thus suggesting the name of the company). Aprisma was subsequently acquired by Concord Communications which in turn was acquired for $350M by Computer Associates, now renamed CA, Inc. 4\\\\. Global Network Technology Services (also known as GNTS) of The Woodlands, Texas, a network installation and management company. GNTS employed more than 800 people but was dissolved in 2001, a casualty of the dot-com collapse and subsequent contraction in demand for network services. Enterasys Networks, now officially a Siemens Enterprise Communications company, continues to manufacture all manner of networking equipment and to make available most of the documentation of the original Cabletron Systems products within their knowledge base. On September 12, 2013, Extreme Networks agreed to buy Enterasys Networks for $180 million.

On 25 December 496 he baptised Clovis I, King of the Franks. This baptism, leading to the conversion of the entire Frankish people to Christianity, was a momentous success for the Church and a seminal event in European history. Life Remigius was born, traditionally, at Cerny-en- Laonnois, near Laon, Picardy, into the highest levels of Gallo-Roman society. He is said to have been son of Emilius, count of Laon (who is not otherwise attested) and of Celina, daughter of the Bishop of Soissons, which Clovis had conquered in 486. He studied at Reims and soon became so noted for his learning and sanctity, and his high status, that he was elected Bishop of Reims at age 21, though still a layman. He was both Lord Chancellor of France and Référendaire of France. The story of the return of the sacred vessels (most notably the Vase of Soissons), which had been stolen from the church of Soissons, testifies to the friendly relations existing between him and Clovis, King of the Franks, whom he converted to Christianity with the assistance of Saint Vedast (Vedastus, Vaast, Waast) and Saint Clotilde, the Burgundian princess who was wife to Clovis. Even before he embraced Christianity, Clovis had showered benefits upon Remigius and the Christians of Reims, and after his victory over the Alamanni in the battle of Tolbiac (probably 496), he requested Remigius to baptize him at Reims (December 25, 496) in the presence of a large company of Franks and Alamanni; according to Saint Gregory of Tours, 3,000 Franks were baptized with Clovis. King Clovis granted Remigius stretches of territory, in which Remigius established and endowed many churches. He erected bishoprics at Tournai; Cambrai; Thérouanne, where he personally ordained the first bishop in 499; Arras, where he installed St. Vedast; and Laon, which he gave to his niece's husband Gunband. In 530 he consecrated Medardus, Bishop of Noyon. Remigius' brother Principius was Bishop of Soissons and also corresponded with Sidonius Apollinaris, whose letters give a sense of the highly cultivated courtly literary Gallo-Roman style all three men shared.Book IX, p. viii Paul Dubois, 1896, at the side of the Abbey of Saint-Remi, in Reims The chroniclers of \\"Gallia Christiana\\" record that numerous donations were made to Remigius by the Frankish nobles, which he presented to the cathedral at Reims. Though Remigius never attended any of the church councils, in 517 he held a synod at Reims, at which after a heated discussion he converted a bishop of Arian views. Although Remigius's influence over people and prelates was extraordinary, upon one occasion his condoning of the offences of one Claudius, a priest whom Remigius had consecrated, brought upon him the rebukes of his episcopal brethren, who deemed Claudius deserving of degradation. The reply of Remigius, still extant, is able and convincing. Few authentic works of Remigius remain: his \\"Declamations\\" were elaborately admired by Sidonius Apollinaris, in a finely turned letter to Remigius, but are now lost.Book IX, p. vii Four letters survive in the collection known as the Epistulae Austrasicae: one containing his defence in the matter of Claudius, two written to Clovis, and a fourth to Bishop Falco of Tongres. The \\"Testament of Saint Remigius\\" is apocryphal. A brief and strictly legendary \\"Vita\\" was formerly ascribed to Venantius Fortunatus. Another, according to Jacobus de Voragine, was written by Ignatius, bishop of Reims.Jacobus de Voragine, The Golden Legend, October 1: \\"St. Remigius.\\" A letter congratulating Pope Hormisdas upon his election (523) is apocryphal, and \\"the letter in which Pope Hormisdas appears to have appointed him vicar of the kingdom of Clovis is proved to be spurious; it is presumed to have been an attempt of Hincmar to base his pretensions for the elevation of Reims to the primacy, following the alleged precedent of Remigius.\\"Philip Schaff, \\"The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge,\\" entry by A. Hauck A Commentary on the Pauline Epistles (edited Villalpandus, 1699) is not his work, but that of Remigius of Auxerre. Remigius' relics were kept in the Cathedral of Reims, whence Hincmar had them translated to Épernay during the Viking invasions and thence, in 1099 to the Abbey of Saint-Rémy. His feast is celebrated on October 1. Remigius and the Holy Ampulla Hand of God fills the two vials, Bottom: the dove of the Holy spirit delivering the Holy Ampulla at the Baptism of Clovis. The plaque manages to cover two versions of the story. Remigius is known through the legend of the Baptism of the Moribund Pagan, according to which a dying pagan asked for baptism at the hands of Remigius, but when it was found that there was no Oil of the Catechumens or sacred Chrism available for the proper administration of the baptismal ceremony, Remigius ordered two empty vials be placed on an altar and as he prayed before them the two vials miraculously filled respectively with the necessary Oil of the Catechumens and Chrism. Apparently when the sepulchre containing the body of Remigius was opened in the reign of Charles the Bald and while Hincmar was the Archbishop of Reims, two small vials were found, the contents of which gave off an aromatic scent the likes of which was like nothing known to those present. If one recalls that when Remigius died the ancient art of perfumery was still known and practiced in the collapsing Roman Empire, but was unknown in the Carolingian empire four hundred years later, these vials may have originally been bottles of unguents used to cover the scent of decay of Remigius’ corpse during his funeral. But the memory of the two vials miraculously filled in the story of the Baptism of the Moribund Pagan, and the unusual, seemingly otherworldly scents issuing from these two vials found buried with Remigius combined to suggest to those present that these two vials were the miraculously filled vials of the legend. It should be remembered as well that it was not uncommon for chalices, patens, and other sacred vessels to be buried with high-ranking clergymen. Hincmar adroitly combined the discovery of, the two vials, the legend of the Moribund Pagan and the historical memory that Saint Remigius had baptized Clovis, into the Legend of the Holy Ampulla (that contained the chrism used by Remigius when he baptized Clovis was miraculously supplied by heaven itself). Hincmar used the new legend to strengthen his claim that his own archepiscopal see of Reims (as the possessor of this heavenly sent chrism) should be recognized as the divinely chosen site for all subsequent anointings of French kings. The fate of the second vial is uncertain. It has been suggested that since in the original form of the legend this would have been the vial containing the Oil of the Catechumens and that the French coronation ordinals prescribe the Oil of the Catechumens, rather than Chrism, for the anointing of queens, it was subsequently used for anointing the queens of France It is possible that a vial currently identified by some of the Bourbon Legitimists as the Sainte Ampoulle is actually this second vial.

This arrangement made the town easily defensible, while having ready access to ridge-top roads along which a traveller would not need to cross any rivers. Also, as was typical with medieval development, the town is fairly compact with narrow streets. History In 1980 and 1981, earthquakes damaged much of the old historical center of Tocco Caudio. Rather than rebuild the historic town, the citizens were forced to completely abandon it and resettle around the ridge.

In electoral fusion, the same candidate receives nomination from more than one political party and occupies more than one ballot line. Fusion was once common in the United States but is now commonly practiced only in New York State, although it is allowed by law in seven other states. The party was active from 1992 to 1998. (There had been an earlier, unrelated New Party in 1968 that ran Eugene McCarthy for President.) Founding The New Party was founded in the early 1990s by Daniel Cantor, a former staffer for Jesse Jackson's 1988 presidential campaign, and by political science, sociology and law professor Joel Rogers as an effort to break with the largely unsuccessful history of progressive third parties in the United States. Their strategy was to run candidates only where they had a reasonable chance of winning, and to nominate on their ballot line (or where this was not legally possible, to endorse) the candidate they favored more from another party. After a false start in New York, the New Party built modestly successful chapters in several states. Some of these chapters--such as those in Chicago and Little Rock, Arkansas--had their main bases of support in the low-income community organizing group ACORN, along with some support from various labor unions. Other chapters--such as those in Minneapolis; Missoula, Montana; Montgomery County, Maryland; and Dane County, Wisconsin, received institutional support from a variety of other labor unions and community organizations. These chapters built local political organizations that ran or endorsed candidates, primarily in local non-partisan races but with occasional forays into Democratic Party primaries or (more rarely) traditional third party-style independent candidacies as well. Some New Party chapters introduced the idea of signed candidate contracts (saying the candidate agreed with the party's principles and would meet with party members after election) before endorsement, to encourage accountability after election—this was criticized by some of the party's detractors.Haber (2001), p. 127: Our preferred candidates subsequently were notified and asked if they were willing to sign an agreement that said nothing more than that they agreed with our party principles and mission statement and that they would meet with us on a regular basis once in office to exchange information and work collaboratively to implement these ideals. While most of those we interviewed found nothing wrong with this process, and in fact understood and supported its importance, our detractors found it cause to complain loudly. Party chapters were also active between elections, pressuring elected officials to pass legislation on issues such as living wages and affordable housing. Influence In Madison, Wisconsin and some other cities, the New Party partnered with Green Party candidates. The New Party endorsed Barack Obama in his successful 1996 run for the Illinois Senate. Although the party's founders hoped to foster a shift in the United States toward electoral fusion, they were not successful in doing so. Their hopes rested largely on the U.S. Supreme Court case Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party. In 1997, the Court, in a 6-3 decision, upheld the Minnesota ban on cross-endorsing candidates, rejecting the New Party's argument that electoral fusion was a right protected by the First Amendment's freedom of association clause. After the Timmons case, the New Party quickly declined and several chapters disaffiliated. Perhaps the only and certainly the most successful surviving local chapter, known as Progressive Dane, remains active and relevant in Dane County, Wisconsin. New Party founder Daniel Cantor and other key staff members left to found the Working Families Party of New York (1998), an organization which has had considerable success in building a New Party-style organization within New York state, and which now has expanded into other states that have fusion voting.

It was started by Tim Berners-Lee creator of HTML and the World Wide Web itself, in 1991 at CERN in Geneva. Unlike commercial index sites, it is run by a loose confederation of volunteers, who compile pages of key links for particular areas in which they are expert. It is sometimes informally referred to as the \\"WWWVL\\", the \\"Virtual Library\\" or just \\"the VL\\". The individual indexes, or virtual libraries live on hundreds of different servers around the world. A set of index pages linking these individual libraries is maintained at http://vlib.org/, in Geneva only a few kilometres from where the VL began life. A mirror of this index is kept at East Anglia (UK). A VL specific search engine has operated for some years and is now (VLsearch) located on its own server at vlsearch.org. The central affairs of the Virtual Library are co-ordinated by an elected Council. A central index (the 'Catalog') is maintained and joint services provided by the Council on behalf of the association. The World Wide Web Virtual Library participated in the SOPA protests on January 18, 2012. History The Virtual Library was first conceived and run by Tim Berners-Lee, and later expanded, organised and managed for several years by Arthur Secret, before it became a formally established association with Gerard Manning as its Council's first chairman. The late Bertrand Ibrahim was a key contributor to the pre-association phase of the Virtual Library's development, and then served as its Secretary until his untimely death in 2001 at the age of 46. A brief history, with links to archived pages and screenshots, is maintained on the Vlib site. The Virtual Library has grown over the years, so that there are now around 300 sub- libraries within the main library. (For example, there is the WWW-VL: History Central Catalogue, which was launched on 21 September 1993 by Lynn H. Nelson at Kansas University. From April 2004, it was relocated at the European University Institute, Florence, Italy where the history of the History catalogue is also available.) The Virtual Library was incorporated as an association sans but lucratif (not for profit association) in the Republic and Canton of Geneva, Switzerland. Major decisions, including a set of bylaws are decided by the membership at large. The main Virtual Library website was redesigned in 2005 and many old or dead individual Virtual Libraries were removed from the index.

The principal role of a stannary town was the collection of tin coinage, the proceeds of which were passed to the Duchy of Cornwall or the Crown. With the abolition of tin coinage in 1838 (following extensive petitioning by the Cornish tin industry for simplification of the taxation rules), the principal purpose for coinage town status ceased. However, coinage towns still retained certain historic rights to appoint stannators to the Cornish Stannary Parliament. Etymology The English word ‘stannary’ is derived from the Middle English stannarie, through Medieval Latin stannaria (‘tin mine’), ultimately from Late Latin stannum (‘tin’) (cf. the symbol for the chemical element Sn). The native Cornish word is sten and tin-workings stenegi. Devon stannaries Devon stannaries are usually referred to by the names of stannary towns. These towns were the locations where refined tin (or white tin) was assessed, coined, and sold. They were also the location for some of the institutions associated with the operation of the stannary. King Edward I's 1305 Stannary Charter established Tavistock, Ashburton and Chagford as Devon's stannary towns, with a monopoly on all tin mining in Devon, a right to representation in the Stannary Parliament and a right to the jurisdiction of the Stannary Courts. Plympton became the fourth Devon stannary town in 1328 after a powerful lobby persuaded the Sheriff of Devon that it was nearer the sea and therefore had better access for merchants. The Devon stannary towns are all on the fringes of Dartmoor, which is the granite upland which bore the tin. No definition of the boundaries of the Devon stannaries is known, if indeed one ever existed. Cornish stannaries The four Cornish stannaries were (from west to east): *Penwith and Kerrier: Most of the hundreds of Penwith and Kerrier (including the granite outcrops of Land's End and Carnmenellis) *Tywarnhaile: St Agnes and the Carn Brea area *Blackmore: the Hensbarrow granite upland, now better known as the St Austell moors or the china clay country *Foweymore: the historic name for Bodmin Moor The geographical jurisdiction of each Cornish stannary was more clearly demarcated that of the others than was the case in Devon, as each represented a separate tin-bearing area, but the boundaries were not precisely laid down. The relative productivity of the stannaries varied greatly and was in no way related to their size.Hatcher, John (1970) Rural Economy and Society in the Duchy of Cornwall 1300–1500. Cambridge University Press . The towns at which coinage was carried out in Cornwall varied over time. The Cornish coinage towns included at various times: Penzance, Truro, Helston, St Austell, Bodmin (probably), Liskeard and Lostwithiel. Penryn twice attempted to acquire coinage town status, supported by Falmouth, but failed on both occasions due to strong opposition from the established coinage towns. Surviving records Survival of stannary records has been rather patchy. The Cornwall Record Office has records from the Vicewarden's Court of the Stannaries of Devon and Cornwall, mostly from the mid nineteenth century onwards, which is rather late in the overall history of the stannary organisations. Earlier survivals in the CRO include the Tin Abstract Books from the Truro Tin office for 1703–10 and 1833–35. These books record the quantities of tin coined in the various coinage towns of Devon and Cornwall, the purchase of tin by the crown and the shipment of this tin by sea to London. Many stannary-related papers including registration of tin bounds, records of tin production and papers relating to disputes are to be found in the records of families with tin mining interests, although these are frequently intermingled with records on other matters so location of specific information is difficult. The National Archives hold most of the records of central government, which includes records on stannary matters including manorial rolls for part of the reign of Charles 1. The House of Lords Record Office also contains relevant material, primarily relating to the special position of the stannary organisations (and tinners) with respect to the law.

The band's first release was the self-financed Fuse cassette. Signing with Portsmouth based independent label Bite Back!, Cranes recorded the Self Non Self mini-LP in 1989, which led to them recording their first of two sessions for John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show.Bottomly, Mo (1991) \\"Cranes\\", Lime Lizard, March 1991, p. 4-6\\"Cranes\\", Keeping it Peel, BBC, retrieved 1 January 2011 They moved to the BMG offshoot Dedicated Records in 1990. With the addition of Mark Francombe and Matt Cope (both guitar), they released a series of EPs in 1990 and 1991 that preceded their debut full- length album, Wings of Joy, which reached number 52 on the UK Albums Chart. Following a general softening of their sound, the introduction of pop elements to their music, and a world tour with The Cure in 1992, the band's popularity increased, and peaked with the release of the album Forever (UK No. 40), which contained their biggest hit single, \\"Jewel\\" (UK No. 29). The band fell silent for a period of approximately four years after the release of Population 4 in 1997, and the subsequent closure of Dedicated, with the original line-up disbanding. In 2000, the Shaws formed a new line-up and began writing music again, and released Future Songs and Particles and Waves on their own label, Dadaphonic.Strutt, Anthony (2004) \\"Cranes : Interview with Alison Shaw \\", pennyblackmusic.co.uk, 24 September 2004, retrieved 28 December 2010 These albums signified a change in the overall style of their music, emphasising its ambient, ethereal qualities. Despite heading in a more electronic direction, however, the band's music continued to revolve around Alison Shaw's distinctive singing. In 2002 the band again supported The Cure, at Hyde Park and several European festivals.

In the order of precedence of Scotland, the office traditionally ranks above all titles except those of the Royal Family.p60-61, Bruce, Alistair, Keepers of the Kingdom (Cassell, 2002), The Lord High Constable was, after the King of Scots, the supreme officer of the Scottish army. He also performed judicial functions as the chief judge of the High Court of Constabulary. From the late 13th Century the Court – presided over by the Lord High Constable or his deputies – was empowered to judge all cases of rioting, disorder, bloodshed and murder if such crimes occurred within four miles of the King, the King's Council, or the Parliament of Scotland. Following James VI's move to England, the jurisdiction of the Lord High Constable was defined in terms of the \\"resident place\\" appointed for the Council. The Constable historically also commanded the Doorward Guard of Partisans, the oldest bodyguard in Britain. The Constable also held several honorific privileges, such as the right to sit on the right side of the King when he attended Parliament, custody of the keys to Parliament House, the ceremonial command of the King's bodyguards, and precedence above all Scotsmen except the members of the Royal Family and the Lord Chancellor of Scotland. Most of the powers, however, disappeared when Scotland and England combined into Great Britain under the Act of Union 1707. The office, nonetheless, continues as a ceremonial one. The office became hereditary in the 12th Century and was held by the Comyn family, but they ended up on the wrong side in the Wars of Scottish Independence. Since then it has been held by the Hays of Erroll, later Earls of Erroll. The first was Gilbert Hay, who was given the office by Robert the Bruce, followed by David Hay. The Constable and the Duke of Hamilton (as Lord of Abernethy) may sit as assessors to the Lord Lyon King of Arms. The Earl of Erroll, Lord High Constable, is one of four peers entitled to appoint a private pursuivant, with the title of Slains Pursuivant of Arms. In 1952, the Court of Claims allowed the right of the Countess of Erroll, as Lord High Constable, to be present by deputy at the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. The present holder (2008) is Merlin Hay, 24th Earl of Erroll. Hundred Years War During the Hundred Years War, a significant amount of Scottish soldiery served in France. These troops served under their own commanders and were quite distinct from their French allies. In order to keep the command structure of the enlarged allied forces intact, the French King appointed a High Constable of the Scots Army, more commonly known as the Constable of Scotland. Perhaps the most celebrated of these men was John Stewart, 2nd Earl of Buchan, who latterly was also created Constable of France.

Born in Altay City, Xinjiang, Kadeer became a millionaire in the 1980s through her real estate holdings and ownership of a multinational conglomerate. Kadeer held various positions in the National People's Congress in Beijing and other political institutions before being arrested in 1999 for, according to Chinese state media, sending confidential internal reference reports to her husband, who worked in the United States as a pro-East Turkistan independence broadcaster for US government propaganda radio stations Radio Free Asia and Voice of America. After she fled to the United States in 2005 on compassionate release, Kadeer assumed leadership positions in overseas Uyghur organizations such as the World Uyghur Congress.  Early life and career  Rebiya Kadeer was born in the city of Altay in Xinjiang. Along with her mother and siblings, she moved to Wensu County of Aksu to join her elder sister, who already lived there. In April 1962, she married her first husband, her sister's neighbor Abdurehim Tohti, after he pitied them and offered them accommodation. = Family history = According to her autobiography, Dragon Fighter: One Woman's Epic Struggle for Peace with China, her family were descendants of migrants who moved across the Tianshan Mountains to Gulja, Merket was the hometown of her mother's father and Khotan was the hometown of her father's parents.Kadeer 2009, pp. 6–7. According to her autobiography, Rebiya Kadeer's father served with pro-Soviet Uyghur rebels under the Second East Turkestan Republic in the Ili Rebellion (Three Province Rebellion) in 1944–1946, using Soviet assistance and aid to fight the Republic of China government under Chiang Kai-shek.Kadeer 2009, p. 9. Kadeer and her family were close friends with White Russian exiles living in Xinjiang and Kadeer recalled that many Uyghurs thought Russian culture was \\"more advanced\\" than that of the Uyghurs and they \\"respected\\" the Russians a lot.Kadeer 2009, p. 13. = First marriage = Due to poverty, Rebiya had to enter her first marriage as a housewife and gave birth to 6 children from 1964 to 1976. But at some point she began independently making and selling clothes and other small articles for additional income. During the Chinese cultural revolution she was suppressed for her efforts, as the Chinese government attempted to break up her family. She claims that the Chinese government told her ex-husband to divorce her. She recounts \\"They put pressure on him to divorce me because they accused me of secretly doing business. They said that it was wrong for me to do secret business.\\" = Entrepreneurship = Following her divorce, Kadeer opened a laundry service in 1976. She later remarried in 1981 to Sidik Haji Rouzi, then an associate professor, who is divorced by his ex-wife Mehmusa, a colleague of Rebiya's elder sister, for his activism. They moved to Ürümqi, having 5 children together. In Ürümqi, Kadeer leased a market in the local business district, and converted it into a department store that specialized in Uyghur ethnic costumes. In 1985, Kadeer converted the building into a 14,000 square meter commercial building. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Kadeer engaged in cross-border trade, accumulating assets which at their peak were worth more than 200 million yuan. She became one of the five richest people in China, and her success earned her the nickname \\"the millionairess\\". The trading company she operated had businesses in China, Russia and Kazakhstan. Kadeer founded the Akida Industry and Trade Co, which owns a number of properties in Xinjiang province. These include The Akida Trade Center, the adjacent Kadeer Trade Center and the Tuanjie, or Unity, theatre in Ürümqi. Kadeer was an active philanthropist within the community, most notably through her foundation, 1,000 Mothers Movement, a charity intended to help Uyghur women start their own local businesses, as well as support underprivileged and orphaned Uyghur children. = As Chinese politician = Kadeer was not always at odds with the government, and was once welcomed as an appointed delegate to the eighth session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the National People's Congress and was a representative to the UN Fourth World Conference for Women in Beijing in 1995.China Frees Rebiya Kadeer. Radio Free Asia. 17 March 2005. She was also a Communist Party member until she was expelled. Kadeer has also served as vice chairwoman of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region Federation of Industry and Commerce, and vice chairwoman of the Xinjiang Association of Women Entrepreneurs. Kadeer wrote that her career was significantly affected by the 1997 Jiashi earthquakes, which were \\"one of the worst natural disasters that had occurred in the Uyghur nation in recent memory.\\" One hundred villages and one thousand homes were leveled. Kadeer organized donations and aid for the area. = Imprisonment = In 1996, her husband and Uyghur independence activist Sidiq Rouzi left China for the United States, working as a broadcaster for the US radio stations Radio Free Asia and Voice of America. Kadeer's failure to denounce Rouzi's anti-China activities and repeated polemics against the government's ethnic policies in the national parliament led her not to be reelected to the National People's Consultative Conference in 1998. Although large newspapers such as the People's Daily or Xinjiang Daily downplay news about separatism or terrorism in Xinjiang, trusted government employees (as Kadeer once was) have access to neican (\\"internal reference reports\\"), which freely report on issues of concern to national security. Kadeer funneled Rouzi two years' worth of the neican publications Kashgar Daily, Xinjiang Legal News, Yining Daily, and Yining Evening News, with a focus on separatists' speeches. As Kashgar and Ghulja (Yining) are the two areas where separatist attacks are the most common, and Xinjiang Legal News contains extensive police reports on the government's counterterrorist operations, the government prepared to charge her with the offense of \\"passing on classified information to foreigners\\". Kadeer was arrested in August 1999 while on her way to meet a US Congressional Research Service, with the additional charge of being in contact with nearly a dozen separatists. She was tried in March 2000 in the Ürümqi Intermediate People's Court and convicted of violating article 111 of China's criminal code governing the leaking of state secrets.Millward (2007), p. 360. Kadeer's imprisonment in the Liudaowan prison in Ürümqi became a cause célèbre in the British and American parliaments. She won the Rafto Prize for human rights while imprisonedEsposito; Voll; Bakar (2007), p. 208. and she claims that she was not tortured in prison because of her newfound international reputation. In the same year, her sentence was reduced by a year based on citations of good behavior where she was being held.  Release and later career  July 2008, Rebiya Kadeer met with George W. Bush in White House On 14 March 2005, Kadeer was released early on medical grounds, into United States' custody in advance of a visit by U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to the region. The U.S., which had pressured for her release, agreed to drop a resolution against China in the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.News Release Issued by the International Secretariat of Amnesty International . Amnesty International. On 17 March, Kadeer flew to the U.S. and joined her family in Washington, D.C. In November 2006, she became the president of the separatist World Uyghur Congress, and later also became president of the Uyghur American Association. In April 2007, one of her sons, Ablikim, was sentenced to 9 years in prison and 3 years deprivation of political rights, reportedly after confessing to charges of \\"instigating and engaging in secessionist activities.\\" In November 2006 Alim, another of her sons, was sentenced to 7 years in prison and fined $62,500. Both were allegedly beaten and tortured in custody. Qahar Abdurehim, yet another of her sons, was fined $12,500 for tax evasion but not jailed. In June 2006, Alim, Ablikim, and Qahar were officially charged with state security and economic crimes.International Religious Freedom Report 2007, US Department of State, 14 September 2007, accessed 28 September 2007 The Chinese government characterizes Kadeer as \\"an ironclad separatist colluding with terrorists and Islamic extremists.\\" In 2007 Kadeer expressed doubt about a police raid on a terrorist camp, reiterating her assertion that Uyghur organizations are not terrorist organizations, and instead fight peacefully. On 5 June 2007, at a conference on democracy and security held in Prague, Kadeer met privately with President George W. Bush, who praised people like her for being \\"far more valuable than the weapons of their army or oil under the ground.\\"President Bush Visits Prague, Czech Republic, Discusses Freedom.

ObserveChina. 18 September 2007. Rebiya Kadeer claimed that Turkey is hampered from interfering with Uyghurs because it recognizes that its own Kurdish issue may get interfered with by China in retaliation. = July 2009 riots = While the protests that preceded the July 2009 riots were ostensibly a response to the death of two Uighur workers in Guangdong, the Chinese government catapulted Kadeer into the limelight when it claimed the WUC, which she heads, had planned the riots. Taiwan denied a visa to Kadeer in September 2009, alleging she had links to the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, which is classed as a terrorist organization by the United Nations and USA. Kadeer has denied the charges. On 3 August, Xinhua reported that two of Rebiya Kadeer's children had written letters blaming her for orchestrating the riots. According to Xinhua, they pleaded: \\"We want a stable and safe life … Please think about the happiness of us and your grandchildren. Don't destroy our happy life here. Don't follow the provocation from some people in other countries.\\" Germany-based spokesman for the WUC rejected the letters as fakes. A Human Rights Watch researcher remarked their style was \\"suspiciously close\\" to the way the Chinese authorities had described rioting in Xinjiang and the aftermath. CCTV broadcast a video of interviews with the family members of Kadeer on 4 August. Xinhua announced in early September 2009 that three properties owned by Kadeer's companies, including the Akida Trade Center, where more than 30 members of Kadeer's family were reportedly living, would be torn down due to \\"cracks in the walls and sunken footings\\". = The 10 Conditions of Love = In 2009, Jeff DanielsSee details at IMDb made a documentary film, The 10 Conditions of Love, about Kadeer. Its premiere was scheduled for the Melbourne International Film Festival, the organizers of which refused a request from the Chinese consulate in Melbourne for the film to be withdrawn and for Kadeer's invitation to the festival to be rescinded.McGuirk, Rod (26 July 2009).

In 2011, Rebiya Kadeer accused the Chinese government of intentionally cultivating multiple Uyghur governments in exile in order to divide the Uyghur people. She believes that independence movements have less support in the international community and the given autonomy by Chinese laws were never implemented. She said that the Uyghur people were never happy under the Chinese rule. = Appeal to Japan for support = In May 2012, while in Tokyo for a conference engagement, Kadeer visited the Yasukuni Shrine, which is controversial because said shrine enshrines Japanese war criminals. She called on the Japanese government to support Uyghurs both financially and politically.  Works  * with Cavelius, Alexandra (2008).

It was part of the Volkspolizei and dealt with all modes of transit but primarily with trains and railroads. It consisted of approximately 8,500 men, that were organized from a national level and at district level with each Deutsche Reichsbahn district; Berlin, Cottbus, Dresden, Erfurt, Greifswald, Halle, Magdeburg and Schwerin. They wore dark-blue uniforms (that were colloquially called “blueberries”) instead of the standard green Volkspolizei uniform. They were organized into sixteen companies and equipped with small arms and RPG-7 shoulder-fired antitank grenade launchers. The Transportpolizei supervised all larger train stations and controlled the travellers, particularly at the border with West Germany, and directed traffic. Before the building of the Berlin Wall, the Transportpolizei controlled the S-Bahn in West Berlin (as the Deutsche Reichsbahn controlled the S-Bahn in both East and West Berlin). In the 'interzone courses' (later called 'transit courses') there was always an escort party of the Transportpolizei present. The service training school of the Transportpolizei was in Halle. From January 1953 until February 1957 the Transportpolizei was part of the Ministry for State Security, in turn part of the Office of the Secretary of State. Starting from March 1957 it was transferred to the Volkspolizei, whose supervising inspector was Otto Auerswald. After German reunification in 1990 the Transportpolizei was dissolved, with some 1200 of its personnel transferring to the (West) German Bahnpolizei. On April 1, 1992 the Bahnpolizei was taken over by the German Federal Border Guard (now called the German Federal Police).

It entails striking a surface with shot (round metallic, glass, or ceramic particles) with force sufficient to create plastic deformation.\\"Shot Peening,\\" Tool and Manufacturing Engineers Handbook (TMEH), Volume 3, Society of Manufacturing Engineers, 1985 In machining, shot peening is used to strengthen and relieve stress in components like steel automobile crankshafts and connecting rods. In architecture it provides a muted finish to metal. Shot peening is similar to sandblasting, except that it operates by the mechanism of plasticity rather than abrasion: each particle functions as a ball-peen hammer. In practice, this means that less material is removed by the process, and less dust created.  Details  Peening a surface spreads it plastically, causing changes in the mechanical properties of the surface. Its main application is to avoid the propagation of microcracks from a surface. Such cracks do not propagate in a material that is under compressive stress; shot peening can create such stress on the surface. Shot peening is often called for in aircraft repairs to relieve tensile stresses built up in the grinding process and replace them with beneficial compressive stresses. Depending on the part geometry, part material, shot material, shot quality, shot intensity, and shot coverage, shot peening can increase fatigue life up to 1000%. Plastic deformation induces a residual compressive stress in a peened surface, along with tensile stress in the interior. Surface compressive stresses confer resistance to metal fatigue and to some forms of stress corrosion. The tensile stresses deep in the part are not as problematic as tensile stresses on the surface because cracks are less likely to start in the interior. Intensity is a key parameter of the shot peening process. After some development of the process, an analog was needed to measure the effects of shot peening. John Almen noticed that shot peening made the side of the sheet metal that was exposed begin to bend and stretch. He created the Almen strip to measure the compressive stresses in the strip created by the shot peening operation. One can obtain what is referred to as the \\"intensity of the blast stream\\" by measuring the deformation on the Almen strip that is in the shot peening operation. As the strip reaches a 10% deformation, the Almen strip is then hit with the same intensity for twice the amount of time. If the strip deforms another 10%, then one obtains the intensity of the blast stream. Another operation to gauge the intensity of a shot peening process is the use of an Almen round, developed by R. Bosshard. Coverage, the percentage of the surface indented once or more, is subject to variation due to the angle of the shot blast stream relative to the workpiece surface. The stream is cone- shaped, thus, shot arrives at varying angles. Processing the surface with a series of overlapping passes improves coverage, although variation in \\"stripes\\" will still be present. Alignment of the axis of the shot stream with the axis of the Almen strip is important. A continuous compressively stressed surface of the workpiece has been shown to be produced at less than 50% coverage but falls as 100% is approached. Optimizing coverage level for the process being performed is important for producing the desired surface effect.Kirk, David, \\"Non-Uniformity of Shot Peening Coverage,\\" The Shot Peener, Electronics, Inc., Summer 2009 SAE International'sStandards Development Program includes several standards for shot peening in aerospace and other industries. Process and equipment Popular methods for propelling shot media include air blast systems and centrifugal blast wheels. In the air blast systems, media are introduced by various methods into the path of high pressure air and accelerated through a nozzle directed at the part to be peened. The centrifugal blast wheel consists of a high speed paddle wheel. Shot media are introduced in the center of the spinning wheel and propelled by the centrifugal force by the spinning paddles towards the part by adjusting the media entrance location, effectively timing the release of the media. Other methods include ultrasonic peening, wet peening, and laser peening (which does not use media). Media choices include spherical cast steel shot, ceramic bead, glass bead or conditioned (rounded) cut wire.MIL-S-13165C Cut wire shot is preferred because it maintains its roundness as it is degraded, unlike cast shot which tends to break up into sharp pieces that can damage the workpiece. Cut wire shot can last five times longer than cast shot. Because peening demands well-graded shot of consistent hardness, diameter, and shape, a mechanism for removing shot fragments throughout the process is desirable. Equipment is available that includes separators to clean and recondition shot and feeders to add new shot automatically to replace the damaged material. Wheel blast systems include satellite rotation models, rotary throughfeed components, and various manipulator designs. There are overhead monorail systems as well as reverse-belted models. Workpiece holding equipment includes rotating index tables, loading and unloading robots, and jigs that hold multiple workpieces. For larger workpieces, manipulators to reposition them to expose features to the shot blast stream are available. =Cut wire shot= Cut wire shot is a metal shot used for shot peening, where small particles are fired at a workpiece by a compressed air jet. It is a low-cost manufacturing process, as the basic feedstock is inexpensive. As-cut particles are an effective abrasive due to the sharp edges created in the cutting process; however, as-cut shot is not a desirable shot peening medium, as its sharp edges are not suitable to the process. Cut shot is manufactured from high quality wire in which each particle is cut to a length about equal to its diameter. If required, the particles are conditioned (rounded) to remove the sharp corners produced during the cutting process. Depending on application, various hardness ranges are available, with the higher the hardness of the media the lower its durability. Other cut-wire shot applications include tumbling and vibratory finishing. Coverage Factors affecting coverage density include: number of impacts (shot flow), exposure time, shot properties (size, chemistry), and work piece properties. Coverage is monitored by visual examination to determine the percent coverage (0-100%). Coverage beyond 100% cannot be determined. The number of individual impacts is linearly proportional to shot flow, exposure area, and exposure time. Coverage is not linearly proportional because of the random nature of the process (chaos theory). When 100% coverage is achieved, locations on the surface have been impacted multiple times. At 150% coverage, 5 or more impacts occur at 52% of locations. At 200% coverage, 5 or more impacts occur at 84% of locations. Coverage is affected by shot geometry and the shot and workpiece chemistry. The size of the shot controls how many impacts there are per pound, where smaller shot produces more impacts per pound therefore requiring less exposure time. Soft shot impacting hard material will take more exposure time to reach acceptable coverage compared to hard shot impacting a soft material (since the harder shot can penetrate deeper, thus creating a larger impression). Coverage and intensity (measured by Almen strips) can have a profound effect on fatigue life. This can affect a variety of materials typically shot peened. Incomplete or excessive coverage and intensity can result in reduced fatigue life. Overpeening will cause excessive cold working on the surface of the workpiece, which can also cause fatigue cracks. Diligence is required when developing parameters for coverage and intensity, especially when using materials having different properties (i.e. softer metal to harder metal). Testing fatigue life over a range of parameters would result in a \\"sweet-spot\\" where there is near exponential growth to a peak fatigue life (x = peening intensity or media stream energy, y = time-to-crack or fatigue strength) and rapidly decay fatigue life as more intensity or coverage is added. The \\"sweet-spot\\" will directly correlate with the kinetic energy transferred and the material properties of the shot media and workpiece. Applications Shot peening is used on gear parts, cams and camshafts, clutch springs, coil springs, connecting rods, crankshafts, gearwheels, leaf and suspension springs, rock drills, and turbine blades. It is also used in foundries for sand removal, decoring, descaling, and surface finishing of castings such as engine blocks and cylinder heads. Its descaling action can be used in the manufacturing of steel products such as strip, plates, sheets, wire, and bar stock.\\"DISA Makes an Impact on The Science and Technology of Shot-Peening,\\" Metal Finishing News, March 2006. Shot peening is a crucial process in spring making. Types of springs include leaf springs, extension springs, and compression springs. The most widely used application are for engine valve springs (compression springs) due to high cyclic fatigue. In an OEM valve spring application, the mechanical design combined with some shot peening ensures longevity. Automotive makers are shifting to more high performance higher stressed valve spring designs as engines evolve. In aftermarket high performance valve spring applications, the need for controlled and multi-step shot peening is a requirement to withstand extreme surface stresses that sometimes exceeds material specifications. The fatigue life of an extreme performance spring (NHRA, IHRA) can be as short as two passes on a 1/4 mile drag racing track before relaxation or failure occurs. Shot peening may be used for cosmetic effect. The surface roughness resulting from the overlapping dimples causes light to scatter upon reflection. Because peening typically produces larger surface features than sand-blasting, the resulting effect is more pronounced. Shot peening and abrasive blasting can apply materials on metal surfaces. When the shot or grit particles are blasted through a powder or liquid containing the desired surface coating, the impact plates or coats the workpiece surface. The process has been used to embed ceramic coatings, though the coverage is random rather than coherent. 3M developed a process where a metal surface was blasted with particles with a core of alumina and an outer layer of silica. The result was fusion of the silica to the surface. The process known as peen plating was developed by NASA. Fine powders of metals or non-metals are plated onto metal surfaces using glass bead shot as the blast medium. The process has evolved to applying solid lubricants such as molybdenum disulphide to surfaces. Biocompatible ceramics have been applied this way to biomedical implants. Peen plating subjects the coating material to high heat in the collisions with the shot and the coating must also be available in powder form, limiting the range of materials that can be used. To overcome the problem of heat, a process called temperature moderated-collision mediated coating (TM-CMC) has allowed the use of polymers and antibiotic materials as peened coatings. The coating is presented as an aerosol directed to the surface at the same time as a stream of shot particles. The TM-CMC process is still in the R&D; phase of development.Haverty, Donncha and Brendan Kennedy, \\"Shot Peening: A Powerful Surface Coating Tool for Biomedical Implants\\", The Shot Peener, Electronics, Inc., Summer 2009. Compressive residual stress A sub-surface compressive residual stress profile is measured using techniques such as x-ray diffraction and hardness profile testings. The X-axis is depth in mm or inches and the Y-axis is residual stress in ksi or MPa. The maximum residual stress profile can be affected by the factors of shot peening, including: part geometry, part material, shot material, shot quality, shot intensity, and shot coverage. For example, shot peening a hardened steel part with a process and then using the same process for another unhardened part could result in overpeening; causing a sharp decrease in surface residual stresses, but not affecting sub-surface stresses. This is critical because maximum stresses are typically at the surface of the material. Mitigation of these lower surface stresses can be accomplished by a multi-stage post process with varied shot diameters and other surface treatments that remove the low residual stress layer. The compressive residual stress in a metal alloy is produced by the transfer of kinetic energy (K.E.) from a moving mass (shot particle or ball peen) into the surface of a material with the capacity to plastically deform. The residual stress profile is also dependent on coverage density. The mechanics of the collisions involve properties of the shot hardness, shape, and structure; as well as the properties of the workpiece. Factors for process development and the control for K.E. transfer for shot peening are: shot velocity (wheel speed or air pressure/nozzle design), shot mass, shot chemistry, impact angle and work piece properties. Example: if you needed very high residual stresses you would likely want to use large diameter cut-wire shot, a high-intensity process, direct blast onto the workpiece, and a very hard workpiece material.

It is unlikely that Crepitus was ever actually worshipped. The only ancient source for the claim that such a god was ever worshipped comes from Christian satire. The name Crepitus standing alone would be an inadequate and unlikely name for such a god in Latin. The god appears, however, in a number of important works of French literature. Roman public toilets from Ostia Sources of the legend The origin of the myth is somewhat obscure, as it is possible that the existence of this god is an invention by a satirist. No ancient polytheistic source appears for this deity. The earliest mention of a god of flatulence is as an Egyptian, not a Roman deity. This comes from the hostile pen of the author of the Recognitions dubiously attributed to Pope Clement I, in which it is reported that: :alii ... crepitus ventris pro numinibus habendos esse docuerunt. ::\\"others (among the Egyptians) teach that intestinal noise (Latin: crepitus ventris) ought to be regarded as a god.\\"Pseudo-Clement, Recognitiones 5.20. English version available in The Ante-Nicene Fathers, Rev. Alexander Roberts and James Donaldson, editors, Vol. VIII. (Grand Rapids, Michigan: Wm. B Eerdmans Publishing Company) It is unlikely that Clement I was the author of the extant Recognitiones; these are extant chiefly in a Latin translation, presumably out of the original Greek, made by Tyrannius Rufinus in the late fourth or early fifth century. The passage of Pseudo-Clement stands within a Western Christian tradition of satire against the variety of minor deities worshipped by classical pagans; similar passages exist in The City of God by Saint Augustine of Hippo, and Tertullian's Ad Nationes.Tertullian, Ad Nationes 2.11; Augustine, The City of God 4.34 Robert Burton, in The Anatomy of Melancholy, mentions a god Crepitus Ventris among a variety of other deities allegedly worshipped in classical antiquity: :Lilius Giraldus repeats many of her ceremonies: all affections of the mind were heretofore accounted gods, love, and sorrow, virtue, honour, liberty, contumely, impudency, had their temples, tempests, seasons, Crepitus Ventris, dea Vacuna, dea Cloacina, there was a goddess of idleness, a goddess of the draught, or jakes, Prema, Premunda, Priapus, bawdy gods, and gods for all offices. Burton cites a work called Syntagma de Diis (\\"A Compendium of the Gods\\") by Lilius Giraldus as his source for the existence of such a god; by this reference, Burton probably meant Giraldus' Historia de diis gentium (\\"History of the Pagan Gods\\"); but because Burton wrote in what he called an \\"extemporean\\" style, quicquid in buccam venit (\\"whatever came into his head\\"),Robert Burton, The Anatomy of Melancholy, Preface, \\"Democritus Junior to the Reader\\" Burton's quotations and references are not always reliable.\\"A Note on the Text\\" by William H. Gass to The Anatomy of Melancholy (New York Review Books Classics) (New York Review of Books, 1991), Because of Burton's mixed Latin and English style, this passage may not say that there was a god named \\"Crepitus Ventris\\", (Latin for \\"intestinal noise\\"), but only that there was a god of intestinal noise. The Latin word crepitus, moreover, did not exclusively mean the sound generated by intestinal gas; it referred to squeaks, groans, knocks, and any nondescript noise in general. In The City of God, Augustine elsewhere refers to crepitus cymbalorum, the clang of cymbals.The City of God 7.24, referring to the use of cymbals in the cult of Cybele. Medical jargon gives the name crepitus to the creaking or popping noises made by the joints. The Latin word for \\"to fart\\" is pēdere.The Latin noun crepitus is in the fourth Latin declension, and its genitive case would also be crepitūs. See generally The Classic Latin Dictionary (Follett, Chicago, 1961) sub. tit. crepitus Voltaire, in a passage of his Philosophical Dictionary devoted to changing conceptions of deity, alludes to a number of real or alleged Roman deities of a less exalted status: :La déesse des tétons, dea Rumilia; la déesse de l’action du mariage, dea Pertunda; le dieu de la chaise percée, deus Stercutius; le dieu Pet, deus Crepitus, ne sont pas assurément bien vénérables. . . Il est sûr que deus Crepitus, le dieu Pet, ne donnait pas la même idée que deus divum et hominum sator, la source des dieux et des hommes. ::\\"The goddess of breasts, dea Rumilia; the goddess of the marital act, dea Pertunda; the god of the toilet, deus Stercutius; the god Fart, deus Crepitus, were surely not quite objects of reverence. . . It is certain that deus Crepitus, the god Fart, did not give the same sort of idea as deus divum et hominum sator, the creator of gods and men.\\" :: -- \\"Polytheism\\", entry in the Philosophical Dictionary of Voltaire.\\"Polytheism\\", entry in the Philosophical Dictionary of Voltaire. Through these passages, the noun Crepitus moves from a common noun to a proper noun. Previous authorities had only claimed that the ancient polytheists, whether Egyptian or Roman, worshipped a god of intestinal noises. Perhaps in Burton's mention, and certainly in Voltaire, Crepitus is the name of a god of flatulence. In Baudelaire Baudelaire criticised both the need of religion and the mediocrity of neopagan artists in a text entitled \\"L'École païenne\\" (\\"The Pagan School\\"): :Pastiche ! pastiche ! Vous avez sans doute perdu votre âme quelque part, dans quelque mauvais endroit, pour que vous couriez ainsi à travers le passé comme des corps vides pour en ramasser une de rencontre dans les détritus anciens ? Qu'attendez-vous du ciel ou de la sottise du public ? Une fortune suffisante pour élever dans vos mansardes des autels à Priape et à Bacchus ? Les plus logiques d'entre vous seront les plus cyniques. Ils en élèveront au dieu Crepitus. ::\\"Pastiche! pastiche! You must have all surely lost your soul somewhere, in some bad place, to be thus running now through the past as emptied carcasses, trying to pick one up from the ancient detritus on stumbling on it by haphazard. Have you not? What are you expecting of the heavens or the folly of the public? Could it be a fortune swollen enough to raise altars to Priapus and Bacchus upon your mansard roofs? The most sane amongst you shall be those most cynical: they shall raise it in honour of the god Crepitus.\\"Full text (French Original) Translation for Wikipedia by Roberto Salazar. In Flaubert Relying on Voltaire's account, Gustave Flaubert put a memorable speech into the mouth of the alleged deity Crepitus in The Temptation of Saint Anthony: :CREPITUS: Moi aussi l'on m'honora jadis. On me faisait des libations. Je fus un Dieu! :L'Athénien me saluait comme un présage de fortune, tandis que le Romain dévot me maudissait les poings levés et que le pontife d'Égypte, s'abstenant de fèves, tremblait à ma voix et pâlissait à mon odeur. :Quand le vinaigre militaire coulait sur les barbes non rasées, qu'on se régalait de glands, de pois et d'oignons crus et que le bouc en morceaux cuisait dans le beurre rance des pasteurs, sans souci du voisin, personne alors ne se gênait. Les nourritures solides faisaient les digestions retentissantes. Au soleil de la campagne, les hommes se soulageaient avec lenteur. :J'ai eu mes jours d'orgueil. Le bon Aristophane me promena sur la scène, et l'empereur Claudius Drusus me fit asseoir à sa table. Dans les laticlaves des patriciens j'ai circulé majestueusement! Les vases d'or, comme des tympanons, résonnaient sous moi;--et quand plein de murènes, de truffes et de pâtés, l'intestin du maître se dégageait avec fracas, l'univers attentif apprenait que César avait dîné!La Tentation de St. Antoine, Project Gutenberg etext (French). ::\\"I once was honoured. Libations were made to me. I was a God! ::\\"The Athenian once hailed me as a favourable omen, while the pious Roman cursed me with raised fists, and the pontiff of Egypt, abstinent from beans, trembled at my voice and paled at my odour. . . ::\\"When the army vinegar ran down unshaven beards, when men helped themselves to acorns, peas, and raw onions, and cooked chopped up goat meat in shepherds' rank butter -- never mind your neighbour -- no one was embarrassed by me. Solid foods made for sound digestions. In the sun of the countryside, men took their ease at their leisure. . . ::\\"I had my glory days. Jolly Aristophanes placed me on the stage, and the emperor Claudius Drusus had me sitting at his table. I made the rounds majestically in the laticlaves of patricians! The golden vessels resounded under me like kettledrums -- and when stuffed with lamprey, truffles, and pâtés, the intestine of the Master noisily emptied itself, an attentive universe learned that Caesar had dined!\\"Translation for Wikipedia by Steve Gustafson. A modern invention While Flaubert learned from his friend Fréderic Baudry, who in turn had consulted Alfred Maury, that \\"poor little Deus Crepitus does not exist; it's a modern invention,\\" he liked his text so much that he left him in.The Temptation of St. Anthony, translated and with introduction and notes by Kitty Mrosovsky (Penguin Classics, 1980) While it is unlikely that the god Crepitus ever existed, the scene from Aristophanes is genuine; in The Clouds Athenians compare thunder to the sound of celestial flatulence.

It occurred between February 24 and April 2005 and involved thousands of CEGEP and universities students from across Quebec.  Background  During the 2003 Quebec general election campaign, the Liberal Party of Quebec, led by Jean Charest, made a promise to freeze education cost. Having to deal with a rough budget, and because of the election promise, the Quebec government changed the Grants and Loans program by transforming $103 million of grants into loans, nearly doubling the debt of the poorest students. Coalitions representing most CEGEPs and universities started to negotiate with the government. Talks and protests, in the form of marches, went on for over a year. Students from most CEGEPs and universities took the streets on April 14, 2004 (the first anniversary of the Charest government's election) and November 10, 2004.  Student strike  During their January 29–30, 2005 congress, the students' unions members of the ASSÉ (Association pour une Solidarité Syndicale Étudiante) and other independent students' unions decide to form the Coalition de l'Association pour une Solidarité Syndicale Étudiante Élargie (CASSÉÉ) to coordinate the upcoming strike campaign. (\\"Cassé\\" is a French word equivalent to \\"broke\\".) The strike was initiated on February 21, by a member of the CASSÉÉ, the anthropology students' association from University of Montreal (Association étudiante d'anthropologie de l'Université de Montréal). But the real start was given on February 24 when over 30,000 students members of the CASSÉÉ, and a few other unions joined the strike. The FECQ and the FEUQ, federations of CEGEP and university unions, called for a student strike on March 4 and March 9 respectively. By March 15, over 100,000 students were on strike. This turn of events surprised many, as these organizations were traditionally opposed to strikes/boycotts as a negotiation tactic. On March 16, 2005 students from traditionally more moderate institutions like École Polytechnique de Montréal, as well as from Concordia University and McGill's Post-Graduate Student Society joined the strike for 24 hours. Between 10,000 and 100,000 students (80,000 being the number most reported) took the streets for a peaceful march in Montreal, creating the largest student protest staged in Quebec until March 22, 2012. The École des Hautes Études Commerciales de Montréal and McGill University undergraduates Students' Society of McGill University joined the strike on March 18 for 24 symbolic hours, though the McGill boycott went largely unobserved and further action was rejected by the student body through an online poll. This constituted the first strike since 1967 for the HEC and the first strike in 40 years for Polytechnique. Agreement On April 2, the student federations and the government reached an agreement that was still left to be voted on by the individual student associations during the week. This agreement consists of a CAN $70M refunding for 2005–2006 and a return of the $103M for the next 4 years, totaling $482M. This money comes from 3 levels: the millennium grant foundation, the federal government and the provincial government. The FEUQ officially endorsed the agreement, while the FECQ maintained a neutral position, saying it was \\"interesting enough\\" to be voted on by the individual members' unions. The CASSÉÉ rejected it. Over the next week, the movement mostly ended, with over two thirds of the students voting for a return to class during the week. However, at least 20 unions representing over 100,000 students rejected the offer and by April 11, there were still approximately 20,000 students boycotting class. During the following 2 weeks, most associations ended or suspended the boycott to allow the students to complete their semester.  Symbol  On March 30, a group of students hoisted the students' symbol on Mount Royal cross. The symbol of support for the student strike was a small square of red cloth worn upon clothing as a kind of ribbon. The Parti Québécois MNAs, then in opposition, wore the red square to demonstrate their support for the striking students. On March 30, a group of students hoisted the symbol opposed to student poverty on Mount Royal Cross. It took a full day before authorities were able to remove it. On its lower panel, it was written: \\"Arrêtons de sacrifier nos enfants\\", which means: \\"Let's stop sacrificing our children.\\" References See also  *1996 Quebec student protests *2012 Quebec student protests *Students' union *Student protest *2012 Quebec general election  External links  * FEUQ * FECQ * ASSÉ Student strike, 2005 Quebec Category:Student strikes Quebec Student Strike, 2005 Category:Student protests in Canada Category:2005 protests Category:2005 in education Quebec Student Strike, 2005 ","title":"2005 Quebec student protests"},{"id":"1619137","text":"Kingdom Centre () is a 99-story, skyscraper in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. When completed in 2002, it overtook the 267-meter Faisaliyah Tower as the tallest tower in Saudi Arabia. It has since been surpassed and is now the fifth- tallest skyscraper in the country, whose tallest two buildings are the Abraj Al Bait Towers and the Capital Market Authority Tower. It is the world's third-tallest building with a hole after the Shanghai World Financial Center and the 85 Sky Tower in Taiwan. The mixed-use tower was developed by Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal and designed by the team of Ellerbe Becket and Omrania, who were selected through an international design competition. It is situated on a 100,000–square-metre site and houses the 57,000-square-meter Al-Mamlaka shopping mall, offices, the Four Seasons Hotel Riyadh, and luxury apartments. There is a 65m skybridge atop the skyscraper. The upper third of the tower features an inverted parabolic arch topped by a public sky bridge. The sky bridge is a 300-ton steel structure, taking the form of an enclosed corridor with windows on both sides. After paying the admission fees, visitors take two elevators to reach that level.  Design  The Kingdom Centre was designed by the US-based architecture firm Ellerbe Becket in a joint venture with the Riyadh-based architecture and engineering firm Omrania and Associates. The building is composed of a tower and a podium comprising two symmetrical wings. The tower's almond-shaped plan and curving forms gives the building a distinctive shape that helps keep it cool, with the narrow ends facing the east and west where heat gain is greatest. A high-performance curtain wall, made from silver, butt-jointed reflective glazing, also helps control heat gain while concealing the three main mechanical floors to create a seamless facade. At the top of the tower, an inverted arch is spanned by a glass skybridge housing a public observation deck.https://www.visitsaudi.com/en/do/family-activities/the-sky-bridge-at- kingdom-centre The large opening allows the building to rise higher than the height limit—30 occupied floors—mandated by local laws. Its design was inspired by iconic structures from around the world, including the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, The Sydney Harbour Bridge, and the Eiffel Tower. From base to top, the tower house 13 floors of offices, 10 stories of hotel, five stories of luxury apartments, and additional office space at the top. The East wing of the podium houses the Al-Mamlaka shopping mall, which features more than 150 stores divided across three levels - the first targeted to young people, the second to fashion and furnishings, and the third level is reserved for women. The West wing houses event and entertainment spaces. = Structure = The Kingdom Center is built on a four-meter-thick, 3,100-square-meter raft foundation. Its structure consists of two systems: reinforced concrete columns, beams, and core for the first 180 meters, and a tubular steel frame structure for the building‘s remaining height. = Mechanical systems = A multi-part mechanical system was created to accommodate the building's mixed- use program. The tower is cooled by a central chilled water plant, supported by a thermal energy storage system that provides 5,000 tons of cooling capacity. This storage system is used during the hottest hours of the day, allowing the building to shift cool-air production to off-peak hours when electrical demand is lowest. The podium structures are served by separate mechanical systems designed to accommodate the needs of the building's unique programs. Systems used to cool these spaces include variable air volume, constant volume, and fan coils.

Autocode was a generic term; the autocodes for different machines were not necessarily closely related as are, for example, the different versions of the single language Fortran. Today the term is used to refer to the family of early languages descended from the Manchester Mark 1 autocoder systems, which were generally similar. In the 1960s, the term autocoders was used more generically as to refer to any high-level programming language using a compiler. Examples of languages referred to as autocodes are COBOL and Fortran.  Glennie's Autocode  The first autocode and its compiler were developed by Alick Glennie in 1952 for the Mark 1 computer at the University of Manchester and is considered by some to be the first compiled programming language. His main goal was increased comprehensibility in the programming of Mark 1 machines, which were known for their particularly abstruse machine code. Although the resulting language was much clearer than the machine code, it was still very machine dependent.Knuth, p. 42-43 Below is an example of Glennie's Autocode function which calculates the formula: f(t) = \\\\sqrt{t} + 5t^3. The example omits necessary scaling instruction needed to place integers into variables and assumes that results of multiplication fit into lower accumulator. c@VA t@IC x@½C y@RC z@NC INTEGERS +5 →c # Put 5 into c →t # Load argument from lower accumulator # to variable t +t TESTA Z # Put t into lower accumulator -t ENTRY Z SUBROUTINE 6 →z # Run square root subroutine on # lower accumulator value # and put the result into z +tt →y →x # Calculate t^3 and put it into x +tx →y →x +z+cx CLOSE WRITE 1 # Put z + (c * x) into # lower accumulator # and return User's manual of Glennie's Autocode Compiler mentioned that \\"the loss of efficiency is no more than 10%\\".Knuth, p. 48 Impact of Glennie's Autocode on other Manchester users' programming habits was negligible. It wasn't even mentioned in Brooker's 1958 paper called \\"The Autocode Programs developed for the Manchester University Computers\\".  Mark 1 Autocode  The second autocode for the Mark 1 was planned in 1954 and developed by R. A. Brooker in 1955 and was called the \\"Mark 1 Autocode\\". The language was nearly machine- independent and had floating-point arithmetic, unlike the first one. On the other hand it allowed only one operation per line, offered few mnemonic names and had no way to define user subroutines.Knuth, p. 63-64 An example code which loads array of size 11 of floating-point numbers from the input would look like this n1 = 1 1 vn1 = I reads input into v[n[1 n1 = n1 + 1 j1,11 ≥ n1 jumps to 1 if n[1] ≤ 11 Brooker's Autocode removed two main difficulties of Mark 1's programmer: scaling and management of two-level storage. Unlike its predecessor it was heavily used.Knuth, p. 65  Later Autocodes  Brooker also developed an autocode for the Ferranti Mercury in the 1950s in conjunction with the University of Manchester. Mercury Autocode had a limited repertoire of variables a-z and a'-z' and, in some ways resembled early versions of the later Dartmouth BASIC language. It pre-dated ALGOL, having no concept of stacks and hence no recursion or dynamically-allocated arrays. In order to overcome the relatively small store size available on Mercury, large programs were written as distinct \\"chapters\\", each of which constituted an overlay. Some skill was required to minimise time-consuming transfers of control between chapters. This concept of overlays from drum under user control became common until virtual memory became available in later machines. Slightly different dialects of Mercury Autocode were implemented for the Ferranti Atlas (distinct from the later Atlas Autocode) and the ICT 1300 and 1900 range. The version for the EDSAC 2 was devised by David Hartley of University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory in 1961. Known as EDSAC 2 Autocode, it was a straight development from Mercury Autocode adapted for local circumstances, and was noted for its object code optimisation and source-language diagnostics which were advanced for the time. A version was developed for the successor Titan (the prototype Atlas 2 computer) as a temporary stop-gap while a more substantially advanced language known as CPL was being developed. CPL was never completed but did give rise to BCPL (developed by M. Richards), which in turn led to B and ultimately C. A contemporary but separate thread of development, Atlas Autocode was developed for the University of Manchester Atlas 1 machine.

He was born around 1575 at 129 de la rue Saint-Honoré in Paris to Nicolas Hébert and Jacqueline Pajot. He married Marie Rollet on 19 February 1601 at the Church of Saint-Sulpice, Paris. In 1606, he accompanied his cousin-in-law, Jean de Biencourt de Poutrincourt et de Saint-Just, to Acadia, along with Samuel Champlain. He lived at Port-Royal (now Annapolis, in southern Nova Scotia) from 1606 to 1607 and from 1611 to 1613 when Port-Royal was destroyed by the English deputy governor of Virginia Samuel Argall. In 1617, with his wife, Marie Rollet, and their three children– Guillaume, aged three; Guillaumette, aged nine; and Anne, aged 14 – he left Paris forever to live in Quebec City. He died there 10 years later because of an injury that occurred when he fell on a patch of ice. Statues of Louis Hébert, Marie Rollet, and their children are prominent in Parc Montmorency overlooking the St. Lawrence River in Quebec City. Early life Louis Hébert was born in Paris in 1575, the son of Nicolas Hébert and Jacqueline Pajot. Nicolas was an apothecary with a practice in Paris. In the tradition of the day, Louis followed in his father's profession. Louis was trained in medical arts and science, becoming a specialist in pharmacology. It was from this that he developed what was to become a lifelong interest in plants and gardening. By 1600, Louis was established in Paris as an apothecary and spice merchant. In 1601, he married Marie Rollet. Meeting with Champlain and Settling in New France In 1604, Hébert's cousin, Pierre du Gua, Sieur de Monts, led an expedition to L'Ile Sainte croix in hopes of making a fortune in the fur trade. The expedition's first winter was very hard. There was a shortage of fresh water and firewood, and 36 of the 80 expedition members died of scurvy. In the following summer of 1605, the expedition relocated across the bay at Port-Royal (today known as Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia). Louis Hébert, apothecary at Port-Royal, Acadia, painted by C. W. Jefferys, collection of the National Historical site of Port- Royal. In 1606, Louis joined the expedition, now located at Port-Royal. As a pharmacist, he was interested in plants and enjoyed horticulture, seeming to possess a \\"green thumb\\", growing hemp and other plants. He was highly regarded, and particular note was made of his knowledge and pleasure in cultivating the land. He participated in the construction of a grist-mill on the Allain River near present-day Annapolis Royal. Experimental farming activities were conducted, with various grains seeded in the local fields. He looked after the health of the pioneers, and cultivated native drug plants introduced to him by the Micmac Indians. He returned to France in 1607, after the trade concession that had been granted to the de Monts expedition had expired. In 1610, Hébert returned to Port Royal with Jean de Biencourt de Poutrincourt. It has been claimed that a few months later his wife joined him and became one of the first French women to come to New France, but the claim has not been documented. Louis continued his agricultural interests, sowing wheat and planting vines. The colony at Port Royal seemed to take root, but in 1613 it was destroyed by the English coming up from Virginia. The French colonists returned to France, and Louis established a medical practice and apothecary shop (pharmacy) in Paris. At this time, Quebec was a settlement of some fifty white men who were all transient soldiers, fur trappers, or missionaries. The economy of the settlement was dependent on some 20,000 beaver pelts that were annually returned to French merchants in exchange for supplies. The \\"Compagnie de Canada\\", made up of merchants from Rouen, St-Malo, and La Rochelle, had a trading monopoly that controlled the fur trade in Quebec. Champlain, who founded Quebec in 1608, saw a desperate need for medical service and agricultural self-sufficiency for Quebec. Champlain had met Louis Hébert during the earlier expedition to Port Royal, and had recognized Louis' outstanding qualities. Champlain approached Louis with an offer from the \\"Compagnie de Canada\\". He had met Louis when they were both in Acadia. They mutually respected each other. =Compagnie de Canada and Permanent Settlement in Quebec= Champlain spent the winter of 1616-1617 in Paris searching for support for his colony of Quebec. Hébert was allured, believing there would be promising opportunities for him in the St. Lawrence Valley. The Compagnie de Canada made Hébert an offer: If he would take his family to Quebec for three years and practice medicine in the settlement and establish farming, the company would pay him an annual salary of 600 livres (pounds) and grant him ten acres of land at the settlement on which to build his house and farm. Louis agreed to the terms and signed the contract. Louis sold his practice and his home, and proceeded with his wife, son, and two daughters to the port of Honfleur, France. When he arrived, Louis was told by the ship's master that instructions from the Compagnie de Canada were that they could only board if Louis agreed to sign a new contract with the company. The new provision reduced his annual salary to 300 livres per year, required him to serve as the physician and surgeon at the settlement, and required him to farm ten aces of land and give the company exclusive right to buy all of his agricultural products at the prevailing price in France. Having already sold his house and left his practice, Louis reluctantly accepted and signed the new contract. On April 11, 1617, Hébert and his family left Honfleur aboard the Saint-Étienne (captained by Normand Morin) and arrived in Quebec on 15 July. Only five other French families were to follow them on similar voyages to New France in the next 10 years. In the spring of 1617 Louis became the first private individual to receive a grant of land in the New World from the French Government. Upon his arrival in Quebec, Louis selected ten acres on a site that is today located in the city of Quebec between Ste-Famille and Couillard Streets, on the grounds of the Seminary of Quebec and Basilica of Notre-Dame. Soon afterward, Louis started clearing out some old-growth forest so he could plant crops. This put him in conflict with the fur trading company, who was strongly opposed to deforestation for farming because of its adverse effect on the fur business. Louis had to work very hard, doing all the work by hand. The fur trading company would not let him import a plough from France. On this land, Louis, his son Guillaume, and an unnamed servant with the help of only an axe, a pick and a spade, broke the soil and raised corn, winter wheat, beans, peas, and livestock including cattle, swine, and fowl. He also established an apple orchard and a vineyard. In 1621, his daughter Guillemette married Guillaume Couillard, who joined the family business. By 1620, Louis' hard work was finally recognized as having been of great service to the colony: for being the physician and surgeon; for being its principal provider of food; and for having fostered good relationships with the natives. He was appointed Procurator to the King, which allowed him to personally intervene in matters in the name of the King. In 1623, Louis became the first \\"Seigneur\\" of New France when he was granted the noble fief of \\"Sault-au- Matelot\\". In 1626 he was further granted \\"le fief de la rivière St Charles\\" in recognition of his meritorious service. His Death Louis died on January 25, 1627 from injuries suffered after slipping on ice. The colony held a funeral for its first colonist. Louis was as respected by the Native Americans as he was by the other Frenchmen. He was first buried in the cemetery of the Recollets, but in 1678 his remains inside his cedar coffin were transported to the newly built vault of the Recollets (the Franciscans) with the remains of brother Pacifique Duplessis. Hébert was the first to be laid to rest in this new structure. Descendants Marie Rollet and her children At the beginning of 1800, Louis Hébert and Marie Rollet had 4,592 descendants married in Quebec, according to the PRDH (Historical Demography Research Program) of the Université de Montréal, making the couple the tenth most important one in French-Canadian ancestry at that time. Given the migratory routes of French- Canadians, their descendants thus live mainly in Canada (especially Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba), but also in communities in New England, upstate New York, and the Midwest (especially Michigan, Missouri, Illinois, Minnesota). Louis Hébert and Marie Rollet had two daughters, Anne and Guillaumette, and one son, Guillaume. Guillaume married Hélène Desportes, said to be the first white child born in New France. Guillaume and Hélène had a daughter, Françoise Hébert, and a son, Joseph who married Marie-Charlotte de Poytiers in 1660. Joseph and Marie-Charlotte had a single son, Joseph in 1661, born while his father was captured and killed by the Iroquois. As there is no further mention of this boy, he is presumed to have died as a small child, and there were no other children. Granddaughter Françoise Hébert married Guillaume Fournier, which ended the surname Hébert descended from Louis. However, some descendants of Louis Hébert and Marie Rollet may also share the name Hébert through marriage of female descendants with other men named Hébert as there were several other male Hébert immigrants to New France or Acadia with male descendants. As their first child, daughter Anne died in her first pregnancy, the descendants of Louis Hébert and his wife Marie Rollet arise from their second child, daughter Guillaumette, and her husband Guillaume Couillard; or from their granddaughter Françoise Hébert (child of son Guillaume) and her husband Guillaume Fournier.

Madame Hebért teaching Lasting Recognition in Canada Detail of statue atop memorial Hébert overcame the hardships and became the first Canadian to support his family from the soil. He imported from France the first ox to pull a plough in Canada, but unfortunately, the first plough did not arrive until a year after his death. Jacques Lacoursière noted that Hébert had many firsts. He was the first colonist of Quebec, first colonist to live off the land, his daughter Anne's marriage to Étienne Jonquet in 1617 was the first in New France, and he was the first lord of New France. When English corsairs David Kirke and his brothers took possession of Quebec, his family did not leave, but waited out the three years until Quebec was returned to France. Marie Rollet quietly remarried, to Guillaume Hubou, two years after Louis' death. After the three year occupation by the English, Champlain asked her to move to Quebec and Louis' house became a residence for Indian youth entrusted to the Jesuits for their education. There is a monument to Louis Hébert in Montmorency Park that symbolizes the importance of Louis Hébert and his family in the beginnings of Quebec. On top is Louis Hébert holding a sheaf of grain (wheat or barley) in one hand and a sickle in the other. On one side of the base, Marie Rollet clasps her three children in her arms. On the other, son- in-law Guillaume Couillard has a plough in hand. ReferencesBibliography * A history of Canada's first permanent colonial settlers.

It occurs in scattered populations from western Montana to central Texas in the United States and south to Coahuila in northern Mexico. Description It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree growing to tall and a trunk of diameter. The bark is dark brown to gray, with narrow fissures and flat ridges creating plate-like scales; it is thin and easily damaged. The leaves are opposite, simple, long and broad, with three to five deep, bluntly-pointed lobes, three of the lobes large and two small ones (not always present) at the leaf base; the three major lobes each have 3–5 small subsidiary lobules. The leaves turn golden yellow to red in fall (this trait is less reliable in warmer areas). The flowers appear with the leaves in mid spring; they are produced in corymbs of 5–15 together, each flower yellow-green, about diameter, with no petals. The fruit is a paired samara (two winged seeds joined at the base), green to reddish-pink in color, maturing brown in early fall; each seed is globose, diameter, with a single wing long.

Desmarais. Distribution and habitat It commonly grows in limestone soils but can adapt to a wide range of well-drained soils, from sand to clays to even white limestone areas. It prefers sheltered canyons, valleys, and the banks of mountain streams, primarily at higher elevations but occasionally at lower elevations in disjunct locales such as the southern edge of the Edwards Plateau in Texas and in the Wichita Mountains of southwestern Oklahoma. Cultivation Although it is found in continental climate over all of its natural range, planted specimens grow well in the maritime climate of Vancouver. It is slow growing when young, and does not have many pests. It is occasionally planted as an ornamental tree, valued for its drought tolerance and ability to grow in rocky landscapes. Uses The sweetish sap is used in western North America to make maple sugar.

While only 100 copies of the Conspiracy in Mind demo were printed, it would be selected as Demo of the Month by the magazine Rock Hard in April. In March they signed with the Danish management company Intromental Management. In April, Stensland left Scariot to concentrate full-time on Communic. =Conspiracy in Mind (July 2004-2005)= In July 2004, Communic signed with the German label Nuclear Blast and in September began recording their debut album, Conspiracy in Mind in the Denmark studios of producer Jacob Hansen. Danish keyboardist Peter Jensen (ex-Sinphonia) played keyboards for the album. It was released on February 21, 2005, and received good reviews, being voted as \\"Album of the Month\\" in the magazines Rock Hard and Heavy, Oder Was!?. Rock Hard subsequently selected Communic as Newcomer of the Year. Following the album's release, Communic toured Europe with Ensiferum and Graveworm, including an appearance at the Gelsenkirchen Rock Hard Festival. Jensen joined the band on the tour, but was not made a permanent member as he did not live in Norway. =Waves of Visual Decay (2006-2007)= In early 2006, the band flew once again to Denmark to record the follow-up to Conspiracy in Mind in Jacob Hansen's studios. This time, Norwegian Endre Kirkesola was brought in to record the keyboard parts in the album. Unlike Jensen, Kirkesola did not tour with the band to promote the album. The album, Waves of Visual Decay, was released in May 2006 and, like its predecessor, also received good critical reviews, being selected as Album of the Month (or Week, or Issue, depending on the magazine) in Swiss magazine Metal World, Portuguese magazine Metal Morfose, Norwegian magazine Scream, German magazines Rock Hard, Guitar Magazine, Metal Hammer, Metal Heart and Heavy, and the e-zine laut.de. =Payment of Existence (2008-2011)= Communic's third studio album, Payment of Existence, was released on May 30, 2008. =The Bottom Deep (2011-present)= Communic released their fourth studio record, \\"The Bottom Deep\\", on July 22, 2011. =Where Echoes Gather (2017-present)= Communic released their fifth studio record, \\"Where Echoes Gather\\", on October 27, 2017.

It begins where Cottonwood Wash and Trout Creek converge in the Hualapai Indian Reservation east of U.S. Route 93 then flows past Wikieup south of Kingman. The Big Sandy River then passes the Signal Ghost Town Site, meanders through the Arrastra Mountain Wilderness, and joins the Santa Maria River in Southern Mohave County to form the Bill Williams River. The Bill Williams River then empties into Alamo Lake State Park. The Big Sandy River is long. The Big Sandy drainage basin covers approximately in Mohave, La Paz, and Yavapai counties. The Hualapai Mountains are west of the river, and the Aquarius and Mohon Mountains lie to the east and southeast, the Juniper Mountains further east, and the Peacock Mountains and Cottonwood Mountains to the north. Hualapai Peak at is the highest point in the basin. The river flows through the Arrastra Mountain Wilderness. Water flow The Big Sandy River flows year-round (perennial flow) south of the Signal Ghost Town site and intermittently above this site. In the period of 2007-2016, the surface water flow of the Big Sandy at the USGS monitoring site at the Signal Ghost Town ranged from a minimum of per second to a maximum output of nearly per second during flooding in early 2010. Except for the northeastern part of the basin, aquifers supply a median well flow of per minute and up to per minute at Cane Springs, along Route 93 north of Wikieup. The largest spring in the Bill Williams River watershed is south of Cane Springs in the Big Sandy watershed; it discharges at per minute. Much of the water pumped from the basin is used in mining operations in the Bill Williams area. The Big Sandy basin, as of 2000, had a population of 1,142 people. Wildlife The Big Sandy River basin is home to numerous animals and plants endemic to the region. An endangered bird, the southwestern willow flycatcher, resides in the basin, which has one of the few riparian areas remaining in Arizona. Wild Burros, a protected species, live in the river valley along with ring-tailed cats, mountain lions, coyote, and elk. Plant species include sycamores, willows, and cottonwoods.

The proposed plant, fueled by natural gas, would have required of water a minute to cool its steam turbines. In April 2015, the US Department of the Interior and Byner Cattle Co., a subsidiary of Freeport-McMoRan, proposed an agreement to transfer water rights from the Byner Cattle Co.'s Planet Ranch holdings on the Bill Williams River to the Big Sandy Basin pumping wells.

ADWR has not taken final action on the Sever and Transfer Applications or the Objections.\\" The agreement allows Freeport to pump and divert an additional 10,055 acre-feet (343 million gallons) of water per year from the Big Sandy Basin. According to the Arizona Department of Water Resources, 96% of all pumped water from the Big Sandy Basin is used for mining purposes. The basin's average annual recharge is 22,000 acre-feet. The Hualapai Tribe, in exchange for their agreement to the water deal, received a $1 million donation for business development from Freeport.

This sequestered tissue is therefore not connected to the normal bronchial airway architecture, and fails to function in, and contribute to, respiration of the organism. This condition is usually diagnosed in children and is generally thought to be congenital in nature. More and more, these lesions are diagnosed in utero by prenatal ultrasound. Symptoms Symptoms can vary greatly, but they include a persistent dry cough. =Complications= Failure to have a pulmonary sequestration removed can lead to a number of complications. These include: * Potentially fatal hemorrhage * The creation of a left-right shunt, where blood flows in a shortcut through the feed off the aorta * Chronic infection with diseases such as **Bronchiectasis **Tuberculosis **Aspergillosis **Bronchial carcinoid **Bronchogenic squamous cell carcinoma Cause There is still much debate to whether pulmonary sequestration is a congenital problem or acquired through recurrent pulmonary infection. It is widely believed that extralobar pulmonary sequestrations are a result of prenatal pulmonary malformation while intralobar pulmonary sequestrations can develop due to recurrent pulmonary infections in adolescents and young adults. The most frequently supported theory of sequestration formation involves an accessory lung bud that develops from the ventral aspect of the primitive foregut. The pluripotential tissue from this additional lung bud migrates in a caudal direction with the normally developing lung. It receives its blood supply from vessels that connect to the aorta and cover the primitive foregut. These attachments to the aorta remain to form the systemic arterial supply of the sequestration. Early embryologic development of the accessory lung bud results in formation of the sequestration within normal lung tissue. The sequestration is encased within the same pleural covering. This is the intrapulmonary variant. In contrast, later development of the accessory lung bud results in the extrapulmonary type that may give rise to communication with the GI tract. Both types of sequestration usually have arterial supply from the thoracic or abdominal aorta. Rarely, the celiac axis, internal mammary, subclavian, or renal artery may be involved. Intrapulmonary sequestration occurs within the visceral pleura of normal lung tissue. Usually, no communication with the tracheobronchial tree occurs. The most common location is in the posterior basal segment, and nearly two thirds of pulmonary sequestrations appear in the left lung. Venous drainage is usually via the pulmonary veins. Foregut communication is very rare, and associated anomalies are uncommon. Extrapulmonary sequestration is completely enclosed in its own pleural sac. It may occur above, within, or below the diaphragm, and nearly all appear on the left side. No communication with the tracheobronchial tree occurs. Venous drainage is usually via the systemic venous system. Foregut communication and associated anomalies, such as diaphragmatic hernia, are more common. Diagnosis Bronchopulmonary sequestration (BPS) is a rare congenital malformation of the lower respiratory tract. It consists of a nonfunctioning mass of normal lung tissue that lacks normal communication with the tracheobronchial tree, and that receives its arterial blood supply from the systemic circulation. BPS is estimated to comprise one to six percent of all congenital pulmonary malformations, making it an extremely rare disorder. Sequestrations are classified anatomically. Intralobar sequestration (ILS) in which the lesion is located within a normal lobe and lacks its own visceral pleura. Extralobar sequestration (ELS) in which the mass is located outside the normal lung and has its own visceral pleura The blood supply of 75% of pulmonary sequestrations is derived from the thoracic or abdominal aorta. The remaining 25% of sequestrations receive their blood flow from the subclavian, intercostal, pulmonary, pericardiophrenic, innominate, internal mammary, celiac, splenic, or renal arteries. =Types=Intralobar sequestration *The intralobar variety accounts for 75 percent of all sequestrations. *Usually presents in adolescence or adulthood as recurrent pneumonias. *The lung tissue lies within the same visceral pleura as the lobe in which it occurs. *Males and females are equally affected with ILS. *In ILS, the arterial supply is usually derived from the lower thoracic or upper abdominal aorta. *Venous drainage is usually to the left atrium via pulmonary veins establishing a left to left shunt. *Abnormal connections to the vena cava, azygous vein, or right atrium may occur. *Two thirds of the time, the sequestration is located in the paravertebral gutter in the posterior segment of the left lower lobe. *Unlike extralobar sequestration, it is rarely associated with other developmental abnormalities. *Patients present with signs and symptoms of pulmonary infection of a lower lobe mass. *It is believed that sequestrations become infected when bacteria migrate through the Pores of Kohn or if the sequestration is incomplete. Extralobar sequestration *The extralobar variety accounts for 25 percent of all sequestrations. *ELS usually presents in infancy with respiratory compromise. *Develops as an accessory lung contained within its own pleura. *ELS has a male to female predominance of 3:1 to 4:1. *Related to the left hemidiaphragm in 90% of cases. *ELS may present as a subdiaphragmatic or retroperitoneal mass. *In general, the arterial supply of ELS comes from an aberrant vessel from thoracic aorta. *It usually drains via the systemic venous system to the right atrium, vena cava, or azygous systems. *Congenital anomalies occur more frequently in patients with ELS than ILS. *Associated anomalies include Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM), congenital diaphragmatic hernia, vertebral anomalies, congenital heart disease, pulmonary hypoplasia, and colonic duplication *Since it is enveloped in its own pleural sac, it rarely gets infected so almost always presents as a homogeneous soft tissue mass. *The mass may be closely associated with the esophagus, and fistulae may develop. =Imaging= *An arteriogram has been considered vital in documenting the systemic blood supply, allowing definitive diagnosis as well as preoperative planning. *The advent of new noninvasive imaging techniques has changed this thinking. Chest radiograph *Sequestrations typically appear as a uniformly dense mass within the thoracic cavity or pulmonary parenchyma. *Recurrent infection can lead to the development of cystic areas within the mass. *Air-fluid levels due to bronchial communication can be seen. Ultrasound *The typical sonographic appearance of BPS is an echogenic homogeneous mass that may be well defined or irregular. *Some lesions have a cystic or more complex appearance. *Doppler studies are helpful to identify the characteristic aberrant systemic artery that arises from the aorta and to delineate venous drainage. CT Chest CT showing pulmonary sequestration *CT scans have 90% accuracy in the diagnosis of pulmonary sequestration. *The most common appearance is a solid mass that may be homogeneous or heterogeneous, sometimes with cystic changes. *Less frequent findings include a large cavitary lesion with an air-fluid level, a collection of many small cystic lesions containing air or fluid, or a well-defined cystic mass. *Emphysematous changes at the margin of the lesion are characteristic and may not be visible on the chest radiograph. *CT technique for optimal depiction of lesions by using state-of-the-art volumetric scanning requires a fast intravenous (IV) contrast injection rate and appropriate volume and delay based upon size. *Multiplanar and 3D reconstructions are helpful. MRI *Contrast-enhanced MRA or even conventional T1-weighted spin-echo (SE) images may help in the diagnosis of pulmonary sequestration by demonstrating a systemic blood supply, particularly from the aorta, to a basal lung mass. *In addition, MRA may demonstrate venous drainage of the mass and may obviate more invasive investigations. *However, CT allows sharper delineation of thin- walled cysts and emphysematous changes than MRI. Treatment Usually the sequestration is removed after birth via surgery. In most cases this surgery is safe and effective; the child will grow up to have normal lung function. In a few instances, fetuses with sequestrations develop problematic fluid collections in the chest cavity. In these situations a Harrison catheter shunt can be used to drain the chest fluid into the amniotic fluid. In rare instances where the fetus has a very large lesion, resuscitation after delivery can be dangerous. In these situations a specialized delivery for management of the airway compression can be planned called the EXIT procedure, or a fetal laser ablation procedure can be performed. During this minimally invasive fetal intervention, a small needle is inserted into the sequestration, and a laser fiber is targeted at the abnormal blood vessel going to the sequestration. The goal of the operation is to use laser energy to stop the blood flow to the sequestration, causing it to stop growing. Ideally, after the surgery, the sequestration steals less blood flow from the fetus, and the heart and lungs start growing more normally as the sequestration shrinks in size and the pleural effusion goes away. The treatment for this is a wedge resection, segmentectomy, or lobectomy via a VATS procedure or thoracotomy. Pulmonary sequestrations usually get their blood supply from the thoracic aorta.

Biography Amaya was born in Olanchito in the department of Yoro. After being educated in La Ceiba, he worked on the banana plantations along the Northern Caribbean coast of Honduras. He published his first work in 1939. He became a journalist in 1941 for El Atlántico (The Atlantic), a La Ceiba newspaper. In October 1943 he founded a weekly magazine in Olanchito called Alerta (Alert). A leading Honduran communist, he moved to Guatemala in 1944 fleeing political persecution, where he worked on the Nuestro Diario (Our Daily) newspaper and was very supportive of the left-wing government of Jacobo Arbenz. In his 10 years in Guatemala he also worked for the Diario de Centro América (Central American Daily), El Popular Progresista (The Popular Progressive) and Medioía (Midday). It was at the beginning of this period that he wrote what is considered his finest novel, Prisión verde (Green prison), which for many years was banned in Honduras, and described life on the banana plantations in the Bajo Aguán valley of northern Honduras, and the consequences of a laborstrike there. When the Arbenz government fell in June 1954, Amador sought refuge in the Argentine embassy before being granted asylum in Argentina where he worked for Sarmiento, a popular educational newspaper. While there, he married an Argentinian, Regina Arminda Funes, with whom he returned to Honduras in May 1957. He began working for El Cronista (The Chronicle), and founded the magazine Vistazo (View) in Tegucigalpa. Soon afterwards, he left Honduras with his family and his two small children, including his son Carlos Amaya Fúnez, to move to Prague, Czechoslovakia where he worked on a magazine called Problems of Peace and Socialism until he died at 50 years of age in a plane crash in 1966 in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia.

It is decorated with Bartolomeo Vivarini's St. Martin and the Beggar A pavise (or pavis, pabys, or pavesen) was an oblong shield used during the late 14th to early 16th centuries. Often large enough to cover the entire body, it was used by archers, crossbowmen and other infantry soldiers. The name comes from the city of Pavia, Italy. Of European origin, the pavise was large, square and convex. A smaller version for hand-to-hand combat and for wearing on the backs of men- at-arms was also made. The pavise is characterized by its prominent central ridge. The concept of using a shield to cover an archer dates to at least the writing of Homer's Iliad, where Ajax used his shield to cover his half-brother Teucer, an archer, who would \\"peer round\\" and shoot arrows.Cf. Book VIII Similar large shields made of wicker were used by Achaemenid sparabara infantry. The pavise was primarily used by archers and crossbowmen in the Middle Ages, particularly during sieges. It was carried by a pavisier, usually an archer, or, especially for the larger ones, by a specialist pavise-bearer. The pavise was held in place by the pavisier or sometimes deployed in the ground with a spike attached to the bottom. While reloading their weapons, archers and crossbowmen would crouch behind them to shelter against incoming missile attacks. Pavises were often painted with the coat of arms of the town where they were made, and sometimes stored in the town arsenal for when the town came under attack. Religious icons such as St. Barbara and St. George were featured on the front of pavises. Even the Hussite chalice was featured on pavises during the Hussite Wars. Most pavises were covered in a coarse, carpet-base-like canvas, before being painted with oil and egg-based paints. Only 200 or so exist today but many were present in the period. A related term, pavisade or pavesade, refers to a decorative row of shields or a band of canvas hung around a sailing vessel to prevent an opponent from observing the activities of those on board and to discourage boarding. Pavesarii The Genoese crossbowmen, an internationally-recognized elite corps, made use of the pavise, utilizing pavesarii (shield bearers). Having over three crossbowmen per pavise suggests that they took turns using the pavise as cover and were used primarily in static or defensive formations.

It was established, as the Imperial Institute, by royal charter from Queen Victoria in 1888 on Imperial Institute Road (now Imperial College Road). Its name was changed to the Commonwealth Institute in 1958 and it moved to Kensington High Street in 1962. By statute, the operations were the responsibility of a Minister of State from 1902 to 2003 and the property occupied for the purposes of the Institute, and of the same name, was held separately by Trustees as a charity asset. In 1999, prior to the end of the statutory regime, arrangements were made for both the property and the operations to be transferred to a company limited by guarantee also called the Commonwealth Institute. The members were the representatives to the United Kingdom of all countries of the Commonwealth, the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs on behalf of Her Majesty's Government (HMG), the Commonwealth Secretary-General, and four independent UK citizens. The organisation in corporate form proved not to be viable and in 2002 the members resolved to close the operations and sell the property which was too costly for the charity to maintain. Following this it was put into liquidation and the net proceeds were vested by the members of the company in a successor registered charity, The Commonwealth Education Trust which is now based at New Zealand House in Central London. The property on Kensington High Street closed in 2004 and the name Commonwealth Institute is no longer associated with it. After an £80 million redevelopment the site became the home of the Design Museum, opening in late 2016. The Imperial Institute Imperial Institute, demolished 1957 Arthur Sullivan conducts his Imperial Ode as Queen Victoria lays the foundation stone, 1887 Imperial Institute architecture The Imperial Institute was established in 1888 to hold and apply the property and assets arising from the contributions given almost exclusively by private citizens from across the Empire in a nationwide collection conceived by the then Prince of Wales in 1886 to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1887. No funding was given by Her Majesty's Government (HMG). It had defined purposes which had a primary emphasis on the exhibition of collections to showcase the various countries' industrial and commercial products and development; and included industrial intelligence gathering and dissemination; the promotion of technical and commercial education; and the furtherance of colonization. The Imperial Institute building was opened in 1893 by Queen Victoria. The Institute's early activities are detailed in its journals. It had a department of commercial intelligence and an active scientific and practical research department from 1895 which was principally engaged in research that supported the industrial and commercial development of the natural products and resources of the dominions and colonies. The building proved too large for the Institute's needs and when HMG wished to find a home for the University of London, a transfer of leases was agreed in 1899 under which the Institute assigned its 999-year lease (with the consent of the landlord) to the Commissioners of Works, who contemporaneously sub-let back to it approximately half of the building, free of rent and rates and with the benefit of various communal services including maintenance, heating and lighting. The transaction also included a capital payment and in later years was portrayed as a gratuitous act of rescue by HMG, however while the Institute had an unencumbered property asset of such substance and value and the power under its Charter to borrow on the security of such assets, it was not at risk financially. The Board of Trade became interested in the commercial and industrial intelligence that had been developed by the Institute, and advanced the view that the interests of both the government of the United Kingdom and the Institute could be best served if the purposes of both bodies were merged, with an indispensable condition of the proposed transfer being that \\"the buildings and funds of the Imperial Institute must not be employed for the general purposes of the State\\". This was effected in 1902 by statute with the then Prince of Wales remaining as President of the Institute. The building and endowment fund set up from the initial collection were recognised as charity assets which were consequently vested in its Trustees. With its President as Trustee and also as the responsible Minister, the Board of Trade was required to fulfil the purposes of the Institute, which remained unchanged. Departmental and Ministerial responsibility was transferred to the Secretary of State for the Colonies by the Imperial Institute (Management) Act 1916 to reflect the development of administrative responsibility that had occurred since 1907. More comprehensive changes were made with the Imperial Institute Act 1925 after a substantial enquiry into the activities of the Institute, whose findings were considered at the Imperial Economic Conference of 1923. Its purposes were reconfigured with a change in prominence from the exhibition galleries, to the promotion of \\"the commercial industrial and educational interests of the British Empire\\". Recommendations made by the Commonwealth Scientific Conference in 1946 and political changes influencing trade and resulting in the UK and 22 other countries signing the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, effective on 1 January 1948, led to the Treasury deciding to distribute the activities of the Institute. By Orders in Council in 1949 the management of the Institute was passed to the Department of Education and its purposes were redefined to retain responsibility for the galleries and its other educational work, but to have no further involvement in development and trade: a change in focus which made the work of the Institute less important for many of the member countries. The Imperial Institute was housed in a substantial and architecturally noted building of the same name on Imperial Institute Road (now Imperial College Road), which ran between Exhibition Road and Queen's Gate in South Kensington, from 1893. The building was designed by T.E. Collcutt and built by John Mowlem & Co from 1887 to 1894;Imperial Institute, Survey of London: volume 38: South Kensington Museums Area (1975), pp. 220-227. and was paid for almost entirely by public subscription.\\"Albertopolis: Expansion of Imperial College\\" , Royal Institute of British Architects. Originally, it had three copper-roofed Renaissance- style towers, but a single 85-metre tower, Queen's Tower (only saved owing to public pressure and the objections of the Royal Fine Arts Commission), is all that remains of the Imperial Institute after demolition in the 1950s and 1960s\\"Albertopolis: Demolition of the institute\\" , Royal Institute of British Architects. to make way for the expansion of Imperial College. As the Trustees of the Imperial Institute were required by the Imperial Institute Act 1925 to hold the Institute buildings for the purposes of the Act, it was determined that a new Bill would be required to allow for the buildings to be demolished and the Imperial Institute to be rehoused. This was effected by the Commonwealth Institute Act 1958, which included a name change for the Institute to the Commonwealth Institute, to recognise the political developments with the creation of the Commonwealth of Nations in 1949 and the increasing number of countries that had been granted independence and become members of the Commonwealth. At that time the responsible Minister was the Minister of Education. The Act also detailed the new site and parameters of size and cost for the new building; and stated that expenses incurred by the Trustees relating to the conditions of the lease of other net expenses incurred by the Minister of Education in connection with the Commonwealth Institute were to be \\"paid out of moneys provided by Parliament\\". This reflected the arrangements made in 1899 under which the Institute (then a Royal Charter company) was granted a fully repairing lease in exchange for releasing, at the request of the Government, approximately one half of its building for the use of the University of London. The Commonwealth Institute 1962–2015 The interior in 2011 In 1962, the Commonwealth Institute moved to a distinctive copper-roofed building on Kensington High Street, immediately south of Holland Park. The building, designed by Robert Matthew Johnson- Marshall & Partners (RMJM), was opened on Tuesday, 6 November 1962, by Queen Elizabeth II. It was open to the public and contained a permanent exhibition about the nations of the Commonwealth, which was designed to inform the public \\"how the rest of the Commonwealth lives\\". The Commemorative Handbook for the occasion of the opening interpreted the Institute's purpose as \\"to foster the interests of the Commonwealth by information and education services designed to promote among all its people a wider knowledge of one another and a greater understanding of the Commonwealth itself\\". In addition to the exhibition, the Institute ran an important library of Commonwealth literature, and hosted cultural and educational events. In 1967 responsibility for the operation of the Commonwealth Institute was transferred to the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Affairs, and then in 1968 to the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (FCO). Various problems with the building had come to light since its completion, and in 1982 a total cost estimate of £312,000 was reported for recommended maintenance work, with the most important structural maintenance item being the waterproofing of the roof. Some work was approved, but the roof continued to leak, and by 1988 it was reported to the FCO that £700,000 was needed for the building to be structurally safe, with internal and essential modernisations being \\"likely to cost £5m\\". Later that year the building was given a Grade II* listing with associated restrictions on any building works or development possibilities. In 1989 a further estimate of £10m was given for more extensive refurbishment. With a background of high maintenance costs, the activities continued, but with an increasing emphasis on revenue generation, and various proposals were explored for commercial development of the site. In 1993, the FCO announced that funding would cease completely in 1996 (the problem of the building being cited as a reason), although this deadline was extended until 1999. Responsibility of the work of the Institute and ownership of the building was transferred to a company, the members of which were all the countries of the Commonwealth (including the United Kingdom) and which was to be funded for three years by the United Kingdom. This failed to attract further funds, and in 2002 the countries decided it would cease its activities and the building would be sold. Funding of £3,996,435 was also provided for specified works to the building incorporating comprehensive repairs to the roof and some required access works. The arrangements also included an indemnity in favour of the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs as responsible Minister. The company continued as a charitable Trust managed on behalf of the members: the High Commissioners to London of the Commonwealth Nations, the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, and the four lay members. The statutes governing the Institute were not repealed until 2003 (with the Commonwealth Institute Act 2002) at which time the remainder of the original Victorian endowment fund was also released to the company without restrictions. By April 2002, the financial model of the Institute as a corporate entity had been recognised as \\"not sustainable\\". A revised plan was immediately put in place, and all funded activities were closed by the end of November. In a general meeting in late 2002, the members agreed to the disposal of the building and to the application of the proceeds (following the settlement of all obligations) to advancing education in the Commonwealth. The Institute held a large number of ethnographic objects and an art collection that had been acquired during the period from the opening of the Imperial Institute. From 1958 until 2003, these were under control of the responsible Minister under the legislation. Following the repeal of the legislation in 2003, some of the exhibits were returned to member countries; approximately 11,810 remaining items from the main areas of the collection (and more than 25,000 items from the secondary areas) were donated to the British Empire and Commonwealth Museum in Bristol, which itself closed in 2009, amid allegations of the unauthorized sale of a significant number of items from its collection.\\"Rise and Fall of the British Empire Museum\\", The Art Newspaper, 3 September 2011. The remainder are now held under trust by the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery. In July 2004, after a progressive run off period honouring advance bookings, the Conference and Events Centre closed. This venture had been the cornerstone of the 1999 business plan, but the maintenance and running costs of the building were high; additionally, by the time of closure the recently renovated roof had begun to leak persistently, and significant expenditure was required to comply with further health and safety requirements. Various possibilities for the future of the building had been explored with advisers, including a public marketing campaign in March 2003. The complexity of dealing with the protected status of the building and the grounds affected the value and the terms on which the property could be sold. An application for the review of the listing was made in November 2004. This caused concern that it might lead to the demolition of the building. In the event, it resulted in a small but very important relaxation of the listing in respect of the administration wing of the building, which, when combined with a relaxation of use in relation to the frontage, meant that for the first time a viable development of the whole site could be envisaged. After creating a development plan that was favourably received by the local authority, the company finally achieved a sale in 2007, following which The Commonwealth Education Trust was formed as a successor charity, and The Commonwealth Institute was put into liquidation. The professional fees for the complex processes leading to the sale of the building required to ensure that the Trustees met their responsibilities: to optimize the value received; for ensuring the security of the pension arrangements; and providing full government service-level redundancy payments for the former staff, cost about £7m. The liquidation proved to be long and complex, and was only completed in 2015 after a High Court hearing settled a number of uncertainties associated with the manner in which the assets had come into the hands of the company from the responsible Minister and the Commonwealth Institute Trustees prior to the repeal of the legislation in 2003. The Commonwealth Education Trust The core purpose of the Institute of advancing education in the Commonwealth is carried on by a registered charity, The Commonwealth Education Trust, which was established in 2007 as the successor trust to the Commonwealth Institute. The Trust focuses on primary and secondary education and the training of teachers and invests on educational products and services to achieve both a beneficial and a financial reward to fund future charitable initiatives. Commonwealth Poetry Award Established in 1971 by the Commonwealth Institute and the National Book League, the Commonwealth Poetry Prize awarded £250 to \\"the best first volume of poetry (to be) published during the previous year by any writer from any Commonwealth country, except the United Kingdom.\\" The building The location of The Commonwealth Institute Built on a site of 3¼ acres with a frontage onto Kensington High Street of , the total floor area of the building was made up of an Exhibition Hall (60,000 sq ft), Administration block (47,500 sq ft), Art gallery and ancillary rooms (5000 sq ft), cinema, stage and dressing-rooms (6000 sq ft) and basement workshops and storage (13,500 sq ft). The Commonwealth Institute was designed by Robert Matthew/Sir Robert Matthew, Johnson-Marshall and Partners, architects, and engineered by AJ & JD Harris, of Harris & Sutherland.Susan Macdonald, Concrete: Building Pathology, Blackwell Publishing, 2002. Construction was started at the end of 1960 and completed in 1962.Sutherland, RJM & Poulton VT, the Commonwealth Institute. Consulting Engineer, May 1962, 600-03. The project was funded by the UK government which was obliged to compensate the Trustees for the loss of the substantial Imperial Institute building (described by Louis Bondy as in the front rank of Victorian monumental architecture). Contributions of materials and grants from Commonwealth countries were sought to augment the small sum of money that the Exchequer had allowed for the new building. The exhibition designer was James Gardner, who worked on the Dome of Discovery in the influential Festival of Britain of 1951, and the gardens was designed by Sylvia Crowe. The contractor was John Laing Construction Ltd. The former Institute building stood on a piece of land acquired from the Holland estate on a 999-year lease for £215,000. The design of the building and gardens were strongly influenced by their proximity to Holland Park. The exterior and structure has been refurbished and the interior has been substantially altered to accommodate the Design Museum. Regarded by English Heritage as the second most important modern building in London, after the Royal Festival Hall, the building had a low brickwork plinth clad in blue-grey glazing. Above this swooped the most striking feature of the building, the complex hyperbolic paraboloid copper roof, made with 25 tonnes of copper donated by the Northern Rhodesia Chamber of Mines. The concept of creating a 'tent in the park' has often been quoted as the inspiration for the shape of the roof, however, according to Roger Cunliffe (the job architect), while Stirrat Marshall-Johnson (the architect partner-in-charge) always saw the building as being 'in the park', there was no conception of 'tent', and the phrase followed form and did not determine it. Its unusual design proved problematic, and it was said to have leaked from the outset. Other design and construction faults emerged relatively soon after completion, which in part stemmed from the restricted budget, and the building proved very costly to run and maintain. The gardens incorporated a large water feature, grass lawns, and a flagpole for each member of the Commonwealth. The interior of the building consisted of a dramatic open space, covered in a tent-like concrete shell, with tiered exhibition spaces linked by walkways. The diagonal, diamond-shaped exhibition block was clearly different from the rectangular administration wing and the junction of the exhibition and administration blocks created a considerable design problem. The Art Gallery measured 95x44 feet and relied primarily on natural lighting. A large picture window facing the park was included to postpone the desire for escape that the four solid walls of many art galleries quickly engender. The fragility of the structure however limited the weight of exhibits. The cinema beneath the art gallery was designed for daily showings of Commonwealth news and interest films but was adaptable for other purposes. It seated 450 and could be used as a lecture hall, and had a workshop stage and stage lighting for the staging of theatre productions. The building was listed Grade II* in 1988 for its roof, its place as a post-war building, its importance in the history of museum and exhibition design, and its historical significance in marking the transition from Empire to Commonwealth. The Sylvia Crowe landscape was entered in the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens in July 1998, but following the sale of the building it was removed. On 22 July 2005 the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Tessa Jowell, rejected a proposal to remove the building's listed status, considered as an obstacle to realising the full potential of the Trust's assets in a report by property consultants to the Commonwealth Institute Trustees. In April 2007, the Commonwealth Institute building was acquired by property developers Chelsfield Partners. A planning brief, issued by the local council in August 2007, called for the preservation of the main structure of the building, preferably for use such as an art gallery that would retain its essential components. The brief also called for greater integration of the gardens with Holland Park. Plans for redevelopment of the site were drawn up by Rem Koolhaas' architectural practice OMA, and submitted for planning permission to the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea in April 2009. They included construction of three six- to nine-story residential buildings, replacing the former Administration wing, and large-scale internal modifications to the interior of the main structure, to enable its use by the Design Museum. After criticism by local residents' groups and The Twentieth Century Society – relating both to the impact of the new buildings on the local streetscape and to the skyline of Holland Park, and to the large scale of the internal modifications to the existing structure – revised plans were submitted in August 2009. The new blocks were to be lower in height, with fewer internal modifications to the existing structure. The revised proposal was approved by the Council on 17 September 2009, and by English Heritage on 25 September 2009.\\"The reasons why English Heritage backed Commonwealth Institute plans\\", Architects Journal, 28 September 2009.

Taken by Ken Torbeck. The University of Saint Mary of the Lake, also called Mundelein Seminary, is a private Roman Catholic seminary in Mundelein, Illinois. It is the principal seminary and school of theology for the formation of priests in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago. Chartered by the Illinois General Assembly in 1844, it has the longest continuous academic charter in the state of Illinois. In addition to the seminary, the University of St. Mary of the Lake offers the Lay Formation Program, Instituto de Liderazgo Pastoral, Diaconate Formation Program, and the Liturgical Institute. Chicago Studies is an academic journal for priests and others in parish ministry. It is edited by the university and seminary faculty along with priests of the Archdiocese of Chicago. History Bishop William Quarter, the first Bishop of Chicago, oversaw the creation and early development of the University of Saint Mary of the Lake with the primary objective of ordaining priests to serve the growing diocese. After years in flourishing operation but growing financial burden, the university was forced to close in 1866. Expressing a need for more priests, Archbishop George Mundelein was compelled to re-open the institution as Saint Mary of the Lake Seminary around 1921. In 1926, the seminary opened a new campus church, designed by Chicago architect Joseph W. McCarthy. The institution became known throughout the world in 1926 as a site for the International Eucharistic Congress. In September 1929, the seminary received a second charter, this time from the Holy See. Cardinal Mundelein obtained from the Sacred Congregation for Seminaries and Universities the authority to grant the international academic degrees of the Holy See. In 1934 the Ecclesiastical Faculty of Theology at Mundelein was honored with a permanent grant of this authority. The seminary became the first American institution to be honored as a pontifical theological faculty under the Apostolic Constitution. The seminal liturgical leader and Catholic Action chaplain Msgr. Reynold Henry Hillenbrand served as rector of St. Mary of the Lake Seminary from 1936-1944. Under the leadership of Cardinal Albert Meyer, in 1961 the seminary opened a second campus in Niles, Illinois. The Niles campus became the site for the two-year liberal arts program. The Mundelein campus included the upper class college studies in philosophy followed by a four-year theology curriculum. Under Cardinal Meyer’s successor, Cardinal John Cody, the undergraduate program was affiliated with Loyola University of Chicago and became Niles College of Loyola University. Saint Mary of the Lake Seminary was now strictly a graduate school of theology. The program which resulted from that revision continued to be implemented for more than a decade, its academic, formation/spiritual and pastoral aspects guided by the Program of Priestly Formation of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops and the directives of the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Institutions. In 1971, Saint Mary of the Lake Seminary became affiliated with the Association of Theological Schools of the United States and Canada, which is the accrediting body for theological seminaries and divinity schools. 1976 saw two milestones in the seminary history. In cooperation with the Center for Pastoral Ministry, the Archdiocese of Chicago’s continuing education school, the seminary began a program of studies leading to the new doctor of ministry degree. Also in 1976, the seminary celebrated the 50th anniversary of the first ordinations held in the Chapel of the Immaculate Conception. In 1982, under the direction of Archbishop Joseph Bernardin, the seminary faculty initiated a thorough revision of the program which had been in place for ten years. The changes had as their goal the better implementation of the objectives set forth in the third edition of the Program of Priestly Formation. In 1986, Cardinal Bernardin announced that the University of Saint Mary of the Lake would be revived with the addition of a continuing education school, the Center for Development in Ministry, to the campus. The new center would continue the work of continuing education for priests which was the mission of the Center for Pastoral Ministry, but would now expand to offer continuing education to all those in ministry, clergy, religious and laity. Saint Mary of the Lake Seminary again adopted the name on its original 1844 charter, the University of Saint Mary of the Lake, and honored its second founder by renaming the graduate school as Mundelein Seminary. During 1996, Mundelein Seminary was visited by members of the Bishops' Committee on Seminaries. After an extensive series of meetings with faculty and students, the members of the committee gave a strong recommendation to the seminary program. Cardinal Francis George continued this development of the university in February 2000 by transferring the Archdiocese of Chicago’s programs of ministry formation to the seminary. Three former agencies of the Pastoral Center were transferred there to become programs of Mundelein Seminary. Joining USML that year were the Lay Ministry Formation Program, the Diaconate Formation Program, and the Instituto de Liderazgo Pastoral. While remaining separate and distinct from the priestly formation program, all are to cooperate under the seminary aegis in advancing the efforts of ministry preparation and formation for all those involved in pastoral ministry. Plans were also begun to separate the continuing education programs of the Center for Development in Ministry from the university and to relocate them as an agency of the Pastoral Center. These same plans included the continued operation of a Conference Center at the University of Saint Mary of the Lake. This would make Mundelein Seminary the center for all basic formation for ministry, while leaving continuing formation to other agencies. To reflect this evolution, the Board of Advisors decided to adopt a compound name, the University of Saint Mary of the Lake / Mundelein Seminary. This follows the style of most of the pontifical universities which have a formal name and a common name which become interchangeable. Also in 2000, Cardinal George established the Liturgical Institute at the University of Saint Mary of the Lake / Mundelein Seminary. This is the first step in a new vision of the cardinal to expand the university to include specialized institutes to support the major ministries of the archdiocese. The Mundelein Psalter, the first complete one-volume edition containing the approved English-language texts of the Liturgy of the Hours with psalms that are pointed for the chanting of the Divine Office, was published in 2007. On September 22, 2012, Sister Sara Butler, M.S.B.T., a professor and a member of the International Theological Commission, was chosen to be one of the papally-appointed experts at the upcoming October 2012 13th Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops on the New Evangelization. Monsignor Dennis J. Lyle was the outgoing rector and president of the seminary and university; he was succeeded on July 1, 2012, by the Reverend Father Robert Barron. Father Thomas A. Baima is the Vice-Rector for Academic Affairs, coordinating the schools and institutes of the university. On December 3, 2012, Elizabeth Nagel was named to succeed Father John G. Lodge as president of the (mostly lay and postgraduate) Pontifical Faculty of Theology. Campus Located north of Route 176 and east of Rt. 45 in the northeastern corner of the Village of Mundelein on Saint Mary's Lake (Illinois), the seminary occupies more than . The eastern portion of St. Mary's Lake extends into Libertyville, Illinois The campus has capacity for about 400 students. It is distinctive for its neo-Georgian architecture, laid out symmetrically and centered upon the chapel, dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary under the title of her Immaculate Conception — the patroness of the seminary. Other important buildings on the extensive campus - unique among Catholic seminaries - are separate seminarian and faculty residences, a classroom building, the refectory, the Feehan Memorial Library/McEssy Theological Resource Center, the administration building, a convent, gymnasium, conference and guest facilities, the Cardinal Stritch Retreat House, and a Villa for the Archbishop of Chicago. The campus is home to the historic Howell-Wurlitzer theatre organ, acquired by Cardinal Mundelein in 1934 and installed in the seminary auditorium. Organization and administration Blase J. Cupich is the chancellor and thus the final authority at the university in his capacity as archbishop of the Archdiocese of Chicago. Academics The Liturgical Institute has its own faculty and is dedicated to training, research and publication in the fields of sacramental theology and liturgy. The Institute offers a professional master of arts in liturgy, an academic master of arts (liturgical studies), and a licentiate in sacred theology. All degrees are awarded by the University of Saint Mary of the Lake / Mundelein Seminary. Student life Sports teams of the university are known as the Lakers.

The release will be the first to incorporate the input from the UBL Payments and Finance Subcommittee established in June 2017.  Subsets and customizations of UBL  Danish subsets: OIOXML and OIOUBL = In December 2003 Denmark legislated the mandatory use of a customization of UBL 0.7, using the OIOXML specification, for electronic invoicing for government procurement starting February 2005. In March 2010 Denmark legislated the mandatory use of a customization of UBL 2.0, using the OIOUBL specification. In 2011 the Danish government documented savings of €500,000,000 having used UBL. = Northern European Subset - NESUBL = As part of the Northern European cooperation on e-commerce and e-procurement, representatives from Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, UK and Iceland set up a working group for developing a Northern European subset of UBL 2.0 documents. The main focus of NES is to define the semantic use of UBL 2.0 as applied to specific business processes. To achieve this the UBL 2.0 standard is restricted on additional levels by using \\"profiles\\" that apply to defined business situations. The use of individual elements is specifically described to avoid conflicting interpretation. Additionally each country has developed guidelines that describe the application of the NESUBL subset to domestic business practices. The goal is to enable companies and institutions to implement e-commerce by agreeing to a specific profile and thus eliminate the need for bilateral implementation. Additional countries have shown interest in joining the work. The NESUBL subset was published in March 2007. Since its publication, NESUBL subset has influenced government eProcurement initiatives across Europe, for example in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, The Netherlands, Turkey. It is also the basis for an eProcurement initiative, ePrior, by the European Commission, Directorate General's of the European Commission, starting with the Directorate General for Information Technology (DIGIT). It is also the basis of the syntax for business documents created by the CEN/BII (Business Interoperability Initiative). = European-wide deployment of UBL in PEPPOL = PEPPOL, the Pan-European Public Procurement Online project now maintained by OpenPEPPOL, adopts the work products of CEN/TC434 and CEN/TC440 that include UBL customizations and syntax serializations of different document types for European business processes. The goal of PEPPOL is to enable public procurement across borders within the EU. It was reported that CEN/TC434 has unanimously agreed to endorse UBL as one of two syntaxes complying with the forthcoming European Norm on e-Invoicing and will be listed in a specific CEN Technical Specification. These efforts support Directive 2014/55/EU on electronic invoicing in public procurement in Europe. On March 3, 2017 this summary update of recent announcements was published, including references to Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Italy (Emilia-Romagna region), Netherlands, Norway, Sweden. = Spanish UBL version based in CCI = In Spain, UBL is being used primarily for electronic invoice encoding.

As of November 1, 2018 it will be mandatory for Swedish electrical authorities to use PEPPOL. = Colombian UBL Customization - DIAN = DIAN, the Colombian national tax and customs directorate, implements UBL 2 as the XML document format for electronic invoicing. = Norwegian UBL Customization - EHF = Difi, the Norwegian agency for Public Management and eGovernment, has chosen to use CEN BII as a base for the EHF formats and the Universal Business Language (UBL) as a foundation for the implemented syntax. = Dutch UBL Customization - UBL-OHNL and Simplerinvoicing = UBL-OHNL is a Dutch government-specific customization for submitting documents via Digipoort. Simplerinvoicing is a community of e-invoicing, ERP and accounting software providers making e-invoicing in UBL available for everyone. It includes access to the PEPPOL network for secure and reliable transfer. In response to the European Directive 2014/55/EU the Dutch government has mandated XML Invoicing for all contracts signed after January 1, 2017 using the UBL-OHNL customization via Digipoort or the Simplerinvoicing customization via PEPPOL. = Australia and New Zealand use of UBL = As part of a national initiative to increase the proportion of businesses participating in the Australian digital economy the Digital Business Council endorsed an Interoperability Framework in 2016. The initial version of the framework includes a set of policies, standards and guidelines to promote the economy-wide adoption of eInvoicing. A subset of UBL 2.1 for the invoice and business response document was included in this initial release. The subset was initially based on a working draft of the European Committee for Standardization's work under the CEN/TC 434 - Electronic Invoicing project In 2017 OASIS established a localisation subcommittee to promote the harmonised use of UBL and to support the broader market adoption across Australia. The subcommittee facilitates an open dialogue for information sharing and collaboration, under the auspices of OASIS transparent governance and operating procedures. Further guidance and support is facilitated by third parties such as * DCAF Online - a contemporary and transparent approach to businesses having visibility of the digital standards and frameworks their service providers support. Recognised service providers are listed and resources are available to support the economy-wide adoption of digital procurement.

Until the advent of modern telecommunication, messages were usually delivered by human envoys. For example, in war, a messenger would be sent from one camp to another. If the message was unfitting, the receiver might blame the messenger for such bad news and take their anger out on them. History An analogy of the phrase can come from the breaching of an unwritten code of conduct in war, in which a commanding officer was expected to receive and send back emissaries or diplomatic envoys sent by the enemy unharmed. During the early Warring States period of China, the concept of chivalry and virtue prevented the executions of messengers sent by opposing sides. An early literary citing of \\"shooting the messenger\\" is in Plutarch's Lives states: \\"The first messenger, that gave notice of Lucullus' coming was so far from pleasing Tigranes that, he had his head cut off for his pains; and no man dared to bring further information. Without any intelligence at all, Tigranes sat while war was already blazing around him, giving ear only to those who flattered him\\".Plutarch's Life of Lucullus (Dryden transl.), paragraph 25; a slightly different account (the messenger was hanged) is in Appian's Mithradatic Wars, paragraph 84 A related sentiment was expressed in Antigone by Sophocles as \\"no one loves the messenger who brings bad news\\" or \\"no man delights in the bearer of bad news\\" (). At the Perseus Project. The sentiment that one should not shoot the messenger was expressed by Shakespeare in Henry IV, Part 2 (1598)Act I, scene 1, lines 95-103; \\"Thou shakest thy head and hold'st it fear or sin to speak a truth. ... Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news hath but a losing office, and his tongue sounds ever after as a sullen bell, remember'd tolling a departed friend.\\" and in Antony and Cleopatra: Cleopatra threatens to treat the messenger's eyes as balls when told Antony has married another, eliciting the response \\"Gracious madam, I that do bring the news made not the match.\\"II, 5; cf. I, 2 : \\"The nature of bad news infects the teller.\\" The term also applied to a town crier, an officer of the court who made public pronouncements in the name of the ruling monarch, and often including bad news. Harming a town crier was considered treason. Current application A modern version of \\"shooting the messenger\\" can be perceived when someone blames the media for presenting bad news about a favored cause, person, organization, etc. \\"Shooting the messenger\\" may be a time-honored emotional response to unwanted news, but it is not a very effective method of remaining well-informed.\\"Bruce W. Sanford, Don't Shoot the Messenger (2001) p. 10 Getting rid of the messenger may be a tactical move, but danger found in nondisclosure may result in either hostile responses or negative feedback from others. \\"People learn very quickly where this is the case, and will studiously avoid giving any negative feedback; thus the 'Emperor' continues with the self-delusion....Obviously this is not a recipe for success\\".Mike Robson/Ciaran Beary, Facilitating (1995) p. 135 Barbara Ehrenreich in Bright-sided/Smile or Die argued that a culture of \\"thinking positive\\" so as to \\"purge 'negative people' from the ranks...[fed into] the bubble-itis\\"Barbar Ehrenreich, Smile or Die (London 2009) p. 188-9 of the 2000s. Reactions to the whistleblowing organization WikiLeaks led to calls not to shoot the messenger. Similar phrases A syntactically similar expression is \\"Please do not shoot the pianist. He is doing his best\\". It originated around 1860 in the Wild West of the United States. Oscar Wilde, during his 1883 tour of the United States, saw this saying on a notice in a Leadville, Colorado, saloon. This phrase is sometimes attributed to Mark Twain, but neither Wilde nor Twain ever claimed authorship.

Giant Tiger Stores Ltd. is a Canadian discount store chain which operates over 250 stores across Canada. Accessed November 8, 2018. The company's stores operate under the Giant Tiger banner in Alberta, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island and Saskatchewan; under the GTExpress and Scott's Discount banners in Ontario only, and under the Tigre Géant banner in Quebec. The chain employs over 8,000 people. Accessed November 8, 2018. The headquarters is located on Walkley Road in Ottawa. In 2018, the company opened a 600,000 square-foot distribution centre in Johnstown, halfway between Montreal and Toronto, at the intersection of Ontario's Highway 401 and Highway 416. Business modelInspiration= In the mid and late 1940s, Giant Tiger founder Gordon Reid, who was then in his early twenties, was a travelling salesman for an importer in the United States.Gordon Pitts, \\"Tightwad philosophy keeps Tiger running\\", Ottawa Citizen, September 27, 1980. In the American Midwest, Reid first saw discount stores. Discount stores were a new concept at the time. He was particularly impressed by Uncle Bill's, a chain headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, which was one of his clients. The discount store concept did not yet exist in Canada, and it therefore represented a business opportunity. Reid reports that he was also inspired by Frank Woolworth’s continent-wide success, half a century earlier, in creating hundreds of profitable Five-and-Dime stores. Reid’s own retail experience, dating back to his first job as a teenager, had been in department stores rather than in discount,\\"Profiting from the bargain basement,\\" in The Enterpriser, (Ottawa), vol. 4, no. 5 (1981). but his mother had worked behind the luncheon counter at a Woolworth’s in downtown Montreal.Vito Pilieci, \\"New CEO grabs Tiger by the tail\\", Ottawa Citizen, October 15, 2010. Reid stated, four decades later, that he had believed, even at this early stage, that it would be possible to build a Canada-wide chain based on this model. Asked by a reporter whether he had ever imagined that Giant Tiger would eventually have the success it was then enjoying, Reid stated, \\"Yes. That was the original intention. The idea for the business came when I was a travelling salesman. I saw the discounters growing. My original inspiration was the F.W. Woolworth Co., obviously that was a big chain. So this was always the plan.\\"\\"Giant Tiger founder shares secrets of 38-year success\\" (interview with Gordon Reid). Ottawa Business Journal. September 20, 1999, p. 7.  Ownership structure  Key head office personnel are co-owners of Giant Tiger Stores, Ltd. Initially, Giant Tiger’s head office was quite small; and ownership was therefore shared among a small number of people. By 1980, ownership had been shared between Reid and ten key employees.Gordon Pitts, \\"Tightwad philosophy keeps Tiger running. Ottawa Citizen, September 27, 1980. Gordon Reid has stated that Canada’s agricultural cooperative movement was his inspiration for this innovation. Making his employees into part-owners of the company ensured that, as in the coop movement, all employees would share a common interest in maximizing profits. Franchise system Giant Tiger #1, opened in Ottawa's historic Byward Market in 1961, was company-owned. The first franchised Giant Tiger was opened by Jean-Guy Desjardins in Maniwaki in 1968. As Reid would explain it forty years later, from the moment the change was made, \\"the [Maniwaki] store made money and I didn't have to do anything. [Jean-Guy Desjardins] did the advertising, he found the location, he merchandised it to suit his customers, he did everything… And, I thought, 'by golly, that's a good system.'\\"Kristin Goff, \\"Canada’s national Tiger \\", Ottawa Citizen, November 17, 2007. Because the chain most often has been shoehorned into existing spaces now too small for the major big-box store or hypermarket chains, individual store managers are given wide leeway in ordering decisions and are free to devote their limited floor space to items which sell well in their local market. This flexibility, and a distribution system in which stores are restocked daily, allows stores to \\"pull\\" only the inventory they immediately need and facilitates greater turnover per square foot of scarce retail space. In 2010, Reid reported that the issuing of no-cost franchises to experienced retailers \\"was a great way to get experienced people. Over the years we had a lot come from Woolworth, Kresge, Kmart and later Zellers.\\" In the same interview, Reid stated that over twenty Giant Tiger franchises are now run by former Walmart employees, most of whom had been attracted by the same franchise system that he had introduced decades earlier. HistoryNumber of stores= Gordon Reid opened the first Giant Tiger store, on George Street in Ottawa’s Byward Market, on May 13, 1961, with a $15,000 investment.Laurie McBurney, \\"Giant Tiger roars loud in the discount jungle\\". Ottawa Citizen, November 29, 1999, p. D3. First-year sales of $139,781 were far lower than Reid had anticipated, and by the end of 1962 he decided to close the store. Unexpectedly, the rush of customers attracted by his going out of business sale provided enough cash flow to keep the business afloat.David Scanlan, \\"King of the Discount Jungle\\", in Ottawa Citizen, October 18, 1991, p. F1. Although the store survived, expansion was slow. A second location, in the small town of Brockville, was not opened until 1965. By the time of the company's tenth anniversary, in 1971, it still had only six stores. As of 2018, there are 230 stores, the most recent three being opened on October 12, 2018 in Saskatoon, Windsor and Hamilton. The 2015 withdrawal of Target Canada from the marketplace presented an expansion opportunity for Giant Tiger. Its first acquisition of a Target store occurred in Fergus, Ontario where of an approximately large Target store was acquired by Giant Tiger. This location opened in the spring of 2016. =Geographic expansion= In 2001, Giant Tiger and The North West Company (NWC) signed a 30-year Master Franchise Agreement that grants NWC the exclusive right to open and operate 72 Giant Tiger stores in western Canada by 2032. In 2013, thirty-one of these stores were open and NWC was eyeing expansion into older city neighbourhoods and rural towns too small to support a Target or Walmart. The chain has undertaken a major expansion in the Greater Toronto Area since 2005. It has opened seven stores in Bradford, Brampton, Markham (now closed), Newmarket, Scarborough and Etobicoke. The 200th Giant Tiger store opened in Nova Scotia in October 2010. In 2004, Giant Tiger opened a single store in Potsdam, New York, its first (and only) in the United States. This store closed during the Great Recession in 2009. =Franchising= In 1968, Giant Tiger opened its first franchise stores, which now account for the majority of locations. The goal was to better serve the customer by having local owners in the stores. The North West Company operates Giant Tiger's 32 locations in Western Canada under a single master franchise agreement. =New brands/trade names= In 1977, Giant Tiger established Chez Tante Marie stores in Hull and Gatineau, Quebec. The Hull store closed in 2015. Another Chez Tante Marie store existed in Lachute, Quebec; this store has since been rebranded as Tigre Géant. In 2017, the last Chez Tante Marie store, in Gatineau, was rebranded as Tigre Géant. In 1996, the Scott's Discount brand was launched as an alternative format for smaller stores. In 2008, Giant Tiger opened its first GT Xpress outlet at a former Giant Tiger location in Ottawa's Hintonburg neighbourhood. GT Xpress stores are intended to service less mobile residents of densely populated neighbourhoods, so that residents will not have to leave the neighbourhood to shop at a big-box store. Because larger retail spaces are unavailable in such inner-city neighbourhoods, the merchandise selection at GTXpress stores is more limited than at a full-size Giant Tiger, let alone a big-box store. Traditional lines of Giant Tiger merchandise are further restricted to free up space for an expanded produce, dairy, deli and bakery section. Effectively, a GTXpress store is a discount version of a convenience store, characterized by a \\"focus on what the customer needs today, as opposed to [carrying a full assortment of] what the customer wants.\\" In view of the fact that the ethnic makeup of individual inner-city neighbourhoods is likely to differ substantially, franchise owner at each GTXpress outlet will have the authority to tailor \\"product lines to cater to ethnic diversity in the area.\\"\\"Giant Tiger reopens community hub\\". Ottawa Citizen, March 15, 2008. =Trucking/warehousing= In 1987, Giant Tiger launched its own trucking fleet (known internally as Tiger Trucking)Mark McNeil, \\"Giant Tiger built on lots of cheap goods.\\" Hamilton Spectator. October 27, 2001, p. B2. to make regular shipments from the warehouse to stores. In 1999 it was reported that the company's trucks were making deliveries to each store three times a week.Bert Hill, \\"Giant Tiger keeps its stripes.\\" Ottawa Citizen, September 15, 1999, p. D1. In 2001, Reid reported that deliveries were taking place daily: \\"We have the most efficient shipping and distribution system in the general merchandise field.... It is equivalent to the grocery stores. We deliver to stores five times per week. There is no one else in the general merchandise industry that does that and we do it with our own trucks.\\" On May 31, 1996, Giant Tiger purchased and took possession of a 29,000 m2 (315,000 sq ft.) distribution centre on Walkley Road in Ottawa, previously occupied by Sears Canada. The company's headquarters moved to this location later the same year. In December 2005, Giant Tiger opened a new 3700 m2 (40,000 sq ft.) distribution centre for frozen and refrigerated products in Brockville, Ontario. In 2018, the company opened a 600,000 square-foot distribution centre in Johnstown, halfway between Montreal and Toronto, at the intersection of Ontario's Highway 401 and Highway 416. =Changes in management structure and key personnel= In October 2010, Reid stepped down as chief executive officer of Giant Tiger, in favour of Andy Gross, a 25-year veteran with the chain, who started working as a buyer when there were fewer than thirty stores. Gross had, by this time, already inherited the presidency from Jeff York. Gross decided to retire effective August 1, 2014 and was then replaced as president and COO by Greg Farrell, who in turn was replaced on March 1, 2015 by former Zellers president and COO Thomas Haig.Haig's appointment was announced in an advertisement in the Globe and Mail, March 2, 2015, p. B3. As of 2015, Reid retains the posts of chairman of the board and CEO. A proposal to sell the company was briefly raised in October 2013, but soon abandoned. In March 2020, The North West Company announced that it would sell 34 of its 46 franchises to Giant Tiger, while closing six underperforming locations, maintaining five in northern markets, and converting one (Prince Albert) to a different banner.

He is the founder of Giant Tiger, Canada’s third-largest chain of discount stores. Early life (1933-1961) Reid was born in Vancouver in 1933 and as a boy moved to the working-class Montreal suburb of Verdun. Reid's mother worked in the retail industry, behind the lunch counter at the Woolworth's in downtown Montreal. His own retailing career began at age 13, gift-wrapping parcels part-time at the Robert Simpson Company in Montreal.\\"Profiting from the bargain basement,\\" in The Enterpriser, (Ottawa), vol. 4, no. 5 (1981). In 1949, at age 16, Reid went to work full- time in the men's furnishings department at Simpsons after he had been expelled from school for what he describes as \\"misbehaving, setting a bad example, something that was quite small.\\" Over the next six years he gradually rose in the company. At age 22 he completed the company's management training program, but left Simpson's when he learned that his pay would remain fixed at $65 a week.John Schofield, \\"Gordon Reid: Lifetime Achievement Award\\", in Canadian Retailer, July/August 2010, p. 47. In 1955, Reid was hired by Frank Hacking, a Toronto-based importer, to sell Japanese-made sporting goods to retailers in Quebec. In 1957, he moved to Windsor and set up an office for Hacking across the river in Detroit, to sell to American retailers.Gordon Pitts, \\"Tightwad philosophy keeps Tiger running\\", Ottawa Citizen, September 27, 1980. It was in the American Midwest during the subsequent two years that Reid first saw discount stores—a new concept at the time. He was particularly impressed by Uncle Bill's, a chain headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. The discount store concept did not yet exist in Canada, and it therefore represented a business opportunity. Giant TigerEarly years (1961-1971)= Reid returned to Canada and in May 1961 opened the first Giant Tiger store, with a $15,000 investment. The store was located at the corner of George Street and Dalhousie Street in Ottawa's Byward Market, in the building that had formerly housed Ottawa's French-language newspaper, Le Droit. Reid was so short of cash that he was unable to afford proper store fixtures, and had to build his own display tables.Laurie McBurney, \\"Giant Tiger roars loud in the discount jungle\\". Ottawa Citizen, November 29, 1999, p. D3. Initially, he had intended to name his store Top Value Discount, but discovered that in Canada, the \\"Top Value\\" trademark was already owned by the Loeb grocery store chain. According to Reid, he made this discovery when he spotted the name on the side of the carton from which he was pouring milk into his breakfast cereal. His second choice was \\"Giant Tiger\\", a name which had not been trademarked in Canada, although it was then being used by another of the discount chains that he had encountered in Ohio. Reid had chosen Ottawa as the location for his first store because he believed that public service paycheques would ensure a customer base with a stable income. As well, the city still had a relatively uncompetitive retail environment, and in particular, no shopping centres. This initial choice would reflect a long-time focus on selecting locations (usually in small towns) that were sheltered from direct competition with other retailers. Reid's intention was to build a national chain, due to his belief that it was necessary to place large-volume merchandise orders in order get the best prices, which could then be passed on to consumers. However, for years it was not possible to put this strategy into effect, as Giant Tiger's expansion was initially extremely slow. In its first year, Giant Tiger’s total sales volume was only $139,781, and Reid had to rely upon his wife's income as a teacher to cover expenses.Mark McNeil, \\"Giant Tiger built on lots of cheap goods\\". Hamilton Spectator Oct. 27, 2001, p. B1, B2. A second store was not successfully opened until 1965, and by the chain’s tenth anniversary in 1971, Giant Tiger had only expanded to six stores, and its survival rested, to a large degree, on the fact that it was servicing uncompetitive markets. =Finding a successful formula and expanding (1971-present)= Reid credits Giant Tiger's rapid growth in subsequent years to several changes in the company's business philosophy. First, the chain altered its merchandise mix from its original focus on male-oriented merchandise such as hardware and sporting goods to an inventory emphasizing clothing and housewares, designed to attract a primarily female clientele. Since this change was made in the early 1970s, the chain's clientele has been about 75% female.Rita Zekas, \\"Store Gazing: Giant Tiger puts the bite on prices\\", Toronto Star, June 18, 2010. Second, Reid made the key head office personnel into co-owners of the chain. By 1980, ownership was shared with ten other individuals. In a 1980 interview, Reid credited the agricultural cooperative movement as his inspiration for this innovation. Making his employees into part-owners of the company ensured that, as in the coop movement, all employees would share a common interest in maximizing profits. The third innovation, which Reid has always insisted is the most important component of Giant Tiger's long-term success, was its unusual method of issuing franchises. A 1980 article describes Giant Tiger's franchise system this way: The practice of issuing $1 franchises and of attracting the best managers from other chains has continued essentially unchanged since that time. In 2010, Reid reported that the issuing of no-cost franchises to experienced retailers \\"was a great way to get experienced people. Over the years we had a lot come from Woolworth, Kresge, Kmart and later Zellers.\\" In the same interview, Reid stated that over twenty Giant Tiger franchises are now run by former Walmart employees, most of whom had been attracted by the same franchise system that he had introduced decades earlier.Hugh Paterson, \\"A retail giant earns its stripes\\", Edmonton Journal, May 10, 2010. The first Giant Tiger franchise, for a store in Maniwaki, Quebec, was issued in the late 1960s to Jean-Guy Desjardins. The benefit of this new way of operating was felt immediately. Up to this point, Reid and his small head office staff had been trying to make all key decisions, with the result that, despite its small size, the chain was slow-moving and inflexible. But from the moment the change was made, \\"the [Maniwaki] store made money and I didn't have to do anything. [Jean-Guy Desjardins] did the advertising, he found the location, he merchandised it to suit his customers, he did everything…. And, I thought, 'by golly, that's a good system.' \\"Kristin Goff, \\"Canada's national Tiger\\", Ottawa Citizen, Nov. 17, 2007. The greater autonomy that could be permitted to franchise owners whose personal financial interests were symmetrical with those of the head office meant that there was less need for Giant Tiger to develop centralized systems. Eleven years after Giant Tiger's first experiment with franchising, Reid emphasized the flexibility that it gave his company: \\"The weakness of the chain stores is that they try to standardize.\\" Such standardization was not possible in a small chain which at the time maintained its low prices by locating in awkward and non-standard spaces such as converted bowling alleys or garages, and which refused to put money into standardized fixtures or furniture, or to invest in standardized office systems. One newspaper reported that \\"Giant Tiger defiantly pretends the computer hasn't been invented. Its idea of a sophisticated inventory and accounting system is a bigger filing cabinet.\\" In the early 1990s, as rumours spread of Walmart's likely expansion into Canada, Reid began to prepare his company for the challenges that would be associated with a much more competitive retail environment. He became a director of the Washington D.C.-based International Mass Retail Association and began to travel regularly to American markets to study Walmart and the survival strategies of its more successful competitors. In more recent years, Reid has slowly been relinquishing direct control of Giant Tiger. In 1999, Reid resigned the presidency of Giant Tiger in favour of Jeff York, an executive with ten years' experience at the company.Richard Roik, \\"Roaring Start for prez.\\" Ottawa Sun, Sept. 15, 1999, p. 38. In October 2010, Reid turned over the post of chief executive officer to Andy Gross, an executive with over 25 years' experience at Giant Tiger, who had, by this time, already inherited the presidency from Jeff York.Vito Pilieci, \\"New CEO grabs Tiger by the tail\\", Ottawa Citizen, October 15, 2010. Reid remains chairman of the board. In 2013, news began to spread that the company was exploring the option of a possible sale. While the business remains profitable, Reid, as its largest shareholder, declared that he was looking for other opportunities after being in the business for more than 50 years.

History The Maine law of 1851 outlawed the manufacture and sale of alcohol in the state of Maine, except for medicinal and mechanical purposes. In May 1855, rumors began to spread that Portland Mayor Neal Dow, an outspoken prohibitionist also known as the \\"Napoleon of Temperance\\", was keeping a large supply of alcohol in the city. As mayor, Dow had authorized a shipment of $1,600 worth of \\"medicinal and mechanical alcohol\\" that was being stored in the city vaults for distribution to pharmacists and doctors (as was authorized under the Maine law), but this detail was not widely reported. To further complicate matters, Dow and the city alderman began a vocal battle over the shipment because they had not authorized the expenditure.Portland (Me.) Advertiser, June 5, 1855, p. 2. Portland’s large Irish immigrant population were particularly vocal critics of the Maine Law, seeing it as thinly veiled racist attack on their culture. They already disliked and distrusted Dow, and this incident made him appear to be a hypocrite. The Maine law that Dow had sponsored had a mechanism whereby any three voters could apply for a search warrant if they suspected someone was selling liquor illegally. Three men did appear before a judge, who was compelled to issue a search warrant. On the afternoon of June 2, a crowd began to gather outside the building where the spirits were being held. The crowd numbered about 200 by 5:00 p.m. and grew larger and more agitated as the day progressed as it became evident that the police had no immediate plans to seize or destroy the liquor. Separate contemporary accounts place the crowd's size between 1,000 and 3,000 by evening (out of a city population of about 21,000). As the crowd became larger, rock throwing and shoving began. Police were unable to deal with the growing mob, and Dow called out the militia. The exact details of the climax of the riot have been hotly debated. What is known is that after ordering the protesters to disperse, the militia detachment fired into the crowd on Dow's orders. One man, John Robbins, an immigrant and mate of a Maine sailing vessel from Deer Isle, was killed, and seven others were wounded. The crowd was dispersed, but Dow was widely criticized for his heavy-handed tactics during the incident. In a twist of irony, Dow was later prosecuted for violation of the Maine Law for improperly acquiring the alcohol. The prosecutor was former U.S. Attorney General Nathan Clifford, and the defense attorney was later U.S. Senator and Secretary of the Treasury William P. Fessenden. Dow was acquitted, but the event was a major contributing factor to the repeal of the Maine law in 1856. Commemorations The 160th anniversary of the Rum Riot was observed in a 2015 ceremony. The ceremony was held indoors because of rain.

It lived during the Early Cretaceous. Discovery and naming ilia, NHM 2150, from the Upper Tunbridge Wells Sand of Cuckfieldalt= In the nineteenth century Reverend William Darwin Fox collected two small thighbones near Cowleaze Chine on the southwest coast of the Isle of Wight. In 1868 he incorrectly suggested these may have come from the same individual that had in 1848 been uncovered for Gideon Mantell as a fossil of Iguanodon, and which in 1869 would be named as the new genus Hypsilophodon. Regardless, both femora, made part of the collection of the British Museum of Natural History as specimens BMNH R184 and BMNH R185, would be commonly referred to the latter genus. However, in 1975 Peter Galton named them as a new species of Dryosaurus: Dryosaurus canaliculatus. The specific name means \\"with a small channel\\" in Latin, referring to a distinct groove between the condyles of the lower thighbone.Galton, P.M., 1975, \\"English hypsilophodontid dinosaurs (Reptilia: Ornithischia)\\", Palaeontology 18(4): 741-752 In 1977 Galton named a new genus for them: Valdosaurus, the name being derived from Latin Valdus, \\"Wealden\\", a reference to the Wealden Group. Its type species, D. canaliculatus, was thus renamed V. canaliculatus.Galton, P.M., 1977. \\"The Upper Jurassic dinosaur Dryosaurus and a Laurasia-Gondwana connection in the Upper Jurassic\\", Nature 268(5617): 230-232 A second species, V. nigeriensis, was described by Galton and Philippe Taquet from younger rocks from Niger in 1982;Galton, P.M. & P. Taquet, 1982, \\"Valdosaurus, a hypsilophodontid dinosaur from the Lower Cretaceous of Europe and Africa\\", Géobios 13: 147-159 this has since been transferred to its own genus, Elrhazosaurus. In 1998 William Blows inadvertently named another species, Valdosaurus dextrapoda, by including this name in a fauna list,Blows, W.T., 1998, \\"A review of Lower and Middle Cretaceous dinosaurs of England\\", New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin, Albuquerque 14: 29-38 but this was an error, and the species has never been supported.Martill, D.M. and Naish, D., 2001, \\"Ornithopod dinosaurs.\\" Pages 60-132 in Martill, D.M. and Naish, D.

Distribution and material Having a close European relative of the American form Dryosaurus named led to most of the dryosaurid fossil material of Europe being referred to Valdosaurus. Valdosaurus was seen as not only present in England (the Wessex Formation of the Isle of Wight and the Hastings Beds of West Sussex) but also in Romania (the Cornet Bauxite of Bihor; this species is sometimes referred to as the separate species \\"Bihariosaurus\\") and Spain. These rock units were deposited between the Berriasian and Barremian stages, between approximately 145 and 125 million years ago. V. canaliculatus would then be known from thigh bones, extensive additional postcranial elements, partial lower jaws, and teeth. In 2009 however, Galton critically reviewed the Valdosaurus material. He concluded that no fossils from outside England could be reliably referred to the genus. He thus gave V. nigeriensis its own genus: Elrhazosaurus. Even of many of the English specimens it was uncertain whether they belonged to Valdosaurus, including all cranial elements and teeth. Some hindlimb and pelvis bones from the Upper Weald Clay Formation (late Barremian) were referable to V. canaliculatus. Some material from the earlier Hastings Beds (Valanginian) were referred to a Valdosaurus sp. Galton established that Richard Owen had in 1842 been the first to describe Valdosaurus thighbones, specimens BMB 004297-004300, assigning them to Iguanodon. Galton emphasized that though the type femora were very small, fourteen centimetres long (which has led to estimates of a length of 1.2 metres and a weight of ten kilogramsPaul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 283), these were from a juvenile individual and that an adult would have been a \\"medium-sized euornithopod\\", with some thighbones reaching a length of half a metre. In 2016, a new specimen of Valdosaurus was described. The specimen is the most complete yet found, which was found in articulation and includes a partial dorsal series, an almost complete tail, pelvic material, and both hind limbs. In life, the specimen would have been around long. Barrett, Paul. (2016).

Phylogeny Galton assigned Valdosaurus to the Hypsilophodontidae, but this paraphyletic unnatural group has largely been abandoned. Today Valdosaurus is generally considered a member of the Dryosauridae.

A coherent representation of objects combining modalities enables animals to have meaningful perceptual experiences. Indeed, multisensory integration is central to adaptive behavior because it allows animals to perceive a world of coherent perceptual entities. Multisensory integration also deals with how different sensory modalities interact with one another and alter each other's processing. General introduction Multimodal perception is how animals form coherent, valid, and robust perception by processing sensory stimuli from various modalities. Surrounded by multiple objects and receiving multiple sensory stimulations, the brain is faced with the decision of how to categorize the stimuli resulting from different objects or events in the physical world. The nervous system is thus responsible for whether to integrate or segregate certain groups of temporally coincident sensory signals based on the degree of spatial and structural congruence of those stimulations. Multimodal perception has been widely studied in cognitive science, behavioral science, and neuroscience. =Stimuli and sensory modalities= There are four attributes of stimulus: modality, intensity, location, and duration. The neocortex in the mammalian brain has parcellations that primarily process sensory input from one modality. For example, primary visual area, V1, or primary somatosensory area, S1. These areas mostly deal with low-level stimulus features such as brightness, orientation, intensity, etc. These areas have extensive connections to each other as well as to higher association areas that further process the stimuli and are believed to integrate sensory input from various modalities. However, recently multisensory effects have been shown to occur in primary sensory areas as well. =Binding problem= The relationship between the binding problem and multisensory perception can be thought of as a question – the binding problem, and potential solution – multisensory perception. The binding problem stemmed from unanswered questions about how mammals (particularly higher primates) generate a unified, coherent perception of their surroundings from the cacophony of electromagnetic waves, chemical interactions, and pressure fluctuations that forms the physical basis of the world around us. It was investigated initially in the visual domain (colour, motion, depth, and form), then in the auditory domain, and recently in the multisensory areas. It can be said therefore, that the binding problem is central to multisensory perception. However, considerations of how unified conscious representations are formed are not the full focus of multisensory Integration research. It is obviously important for the senses to interact in order to maximize how efficiently people interact with the environment. For perceptual experience and behavior to benefit from the simultaneous stimulation of multiple sensory modalities, integration of the information from these modalities is necessary. Some of the mechanisms mediating this phenomenon and its subsequent effects on cognitive and behavioural processes will be examined hereafter. Perception is often defined as one's conscious experience, and thereby combines inputs from all relevant senses and prior knowledge. Perception is also defined and studied in terms of feature extraction, which is several hundred milliseconds away from conscious experience. Notwithstanding the existence of Gestalt psychology schools that advocate a holistic approach to the operation of the brain, the physiological processes underlying the formation of percepts and conscious experience have been vastly understudied. Nevertheless, burgeoning neuroscience research continues to enrich our understanding of the many details of the brain, including neural structures implicated in multisensory integration such as the superior colliculus (SC) and various cortical structures such as the superior temporal gyrus (GT) and visual and auditory association areas. Although the structure and function of the SC are well known, the cortex and the relationship between its constituent parts are presently the subject of much investigation. Concurrently, the recent impetus on integration has enabled investigation into perceptual phenomena such as the ventriloquism effect, rapid localization of stimuli and the McGurk effect; culminating in a more thorough understanding of the human brain and its functions. =History= Studies of sensory processing in humans and other animals has traditionally been performed one sense at a time, and to the present day, numerous academic societies and journals are largely restricted to considering sensory modalities separately ('Vision Research', 'Hearing Research' etc.). However, there is also a long and parallel history of multisensory research. An example is the Stratton's (1896) experiments on the somatosensory effects of wearing vision-distorting prism glasses. Multisensory interactions or crossmodal effects in which the perception of a stimulus is influenced by the presence of another type of stimulus are referred since very early in the past. They were reviewed by Hartmann in a fundamental book where, among several references to different types of multisensory interactions, reference is made to the work of Urbantschitsch in 1888 who reported on the improvement of visual acuity by auditive stimuli in subjects with damaged brain. This effect was also found latter in normals by Krakov and Hartmann, as well as the fact that the visual acuity could be improved by other type of stimuli. It is also noteworthy the amount of work in the early thirties on intersensory relations in Soviet Union, reviewed by London. A remarkable multisensory research is the extensive work of GonzaloGonzalo, J. (1945, 1950, 1952, 2010). Dinámica Cerebral, Open Access.

In this syndrome, all the sensory functions are affected, and with symmetric bilaterality, in spite of being a unilateral lesion where the primary areas were not involved. A feature of this syndrome is the great permeability to crossmodal effects between visual, tactile, auditive stimuli as well as muscular effort to improve the perception, also decreasing the reaction times. The improvement by crossmodal effect was found to be greater as the primary stimulus to be perceived was weaker, and as the cortical lesion was greater (Vol I and II of reference). This author interpreted these phenomena under a dynamic physiological concept, and from a model based on functional gradients through the cortex and scaling laws of dynamical systems, thus highlighting the functional unity of the cortex. According to the functional cortical gradients, the specificity of the cortex would be distributed in gradation, and the overlap of different specific gradients would be related to multisensory interactions.Gonzalo, J. (1952). \\"Las funciones cerebrales humanas según nuevos datos y bases fisiológicas. Una introducción a los estudios de Dinámica Cerebral\\". Trabajos del Inst. Cajal de Investigaciones Biológicas XLIV: pp. 95–157. Complete English translation, Open Access. Multisensory research has recently gained enormous interest and popularity. =Example of spatial and structural congruence= When we hear a car honk, we would determine which car triggers the honk by which car we see is the spatially closest to the honk. It's a spatially congruent example by combining visual and auditory stimuli. On the other hand, the sound and the pictures of a TV program would be integrated as structurally congruent by combining visual and auditory stimuli. However, if the sound and the pictures did not meaningfully fit, we would segregate the two stimuli. Therefore, spatial or structural congruence comes from not only combining the stimuli but is also determined by our understanding. Theories and approachesVisual dominance= Literature on spatial crossmodal biases suggests that visual modality often influences information from other senses. Some research indicates that vision dominates what we hear, when varying the degree of spatial congruency. This is known as the ventriloquist effect. In cases of visual and haptic integration, children younger than 8 years of age show visual dominance when required to identify object orientation. However, haptic dominance occurs when the factor to identify is object size. =Modality appropriateness= According to Welch and Warren (1980), the Modality Appropriateness Hypothesis states that the influence of perception in each modality in multisensory integration depends on that modality's appropriateness for the given task. Thus, vision has a greater influence on integrated localization than hearing, and hearing and touch have a greater bearing on timing estimates than vision. More recent studies refine this early qualitative account of multisensory integration. Alais and Burr (2004), found that following progressive degradation in the quality of a visual stimulus, participants' perception of spatial location was determined progressively more by a simultaneous auditory cue. However, they also progressively changed the temporal uncertainty of the auditory cue; eventually concluding that it is the uncertainty of individual modalities that determine to what extent information from each modality is considered when forming a percept. This conclusion is similar in some respects to the 'inverse effectiveness rule'. The extent to which multisensory integration occurs may vary according to the ambiguity of the relevant stimuli. In support of this notion, a recent study shows that weak senses such as olfaction can even modulate the perception of visual information as long as the reliability of visual signals is adequately compromised. =Bayesian integration= The theory of Bayesian integration is based on the fact that the brain must deal with a number of inputs, which vary in reliability. In dealing with these inputs, it must construct a coherent representation of the world that corresponds to reality. The Bayesian integration view is that the brain uses a form of Bayesian inference. This view has been backed up by computational modeling of such a Bayesian inference from signals to coherent representation, which shows similar characteristics to integration in the brain. Cue combination vs. causal inference models With the assumption of independence between various sources, traditional cue combination model is successful in modality integration. However, depending on the discrepancies between modalities, there might be different forms of stimuli fusion: integration, partial integration, and segregation. To fully understand the other two types, we have to use causal inference model without the assumption as cue combination model. This freedom gives us general combination of any numbers of signals and modalities by using Bayes' rule to make causal inference of sensory signals. The hierarchical vs. non-hierarchical models The difference between two models is that hierarchical model can explicitly make causal inference to predict certain stimulus while non- hierarchical model can only predict joint probability of stimuli. However, hierarchical model is actually a special case of non-hierarchical model by setting joint prior as a weighted average of the prior to common and independent causes, each weighted by their prior probability. Based on the correspondence of these two models, we can also say that hierarchical is a mixture modal of non-hierarchical model. Independence of likelihoods and priors For Bayesian model, the prior and likelihood generally represent the statistics of the environment and the sensory representations. The independence of priors and likelihoods is not assured since the prior may vary with likelihood only by the representations. However, the independence has been proved by Shams with series of parameter control in multi sensory perception experiment. Principles The contributions of Barry Stein, Alex Meredith, and their colleagues (e.g.\\"The merging of the senses\\" 1993,) are widely considered to be the groundbreaking work in the modern field of multisensory integration. Through detailed long-term study of the neurophysiology of the superior colliculus, they distilled three general principles by which multisensory integration may best be described. *The spatial rule states that multisensory integration is more likely or stronger when the constituent unisensory stimuli arise from approximately the same location. *The temporal rule states that multisensory integration is more likely or stronger when the constituent unisensory stimuli arise at approximately the same time. *The principle of inverse effectiveness states that multisensory integration is more likely or stronger when the constituent unisensory stimuli evoke relatively weak responses when presented in isolation. =Perceptual and behavioral consequences = A unimodal approach dominated scientific literature until the beginning of this century. Although this enabled rapid progression of neural mapping, and an improved understanding of neural structures, the investigation of perception remained relatively stagnant, with a few exceptions. The recent revitalized enthusiasm into perceptual research is indicative of a substantial shift away from reductionism and toward gestalt methodologies. Gestalt theory, dominant in the late 19th and early 20th centuries espoused two general principles: the 'principle of totality' in which conscious experience must be considered globally, and the 'principle of psychophysical isomorphism' which states that perceptual phenomena are correlated with cerebral activity. Just these ideas were already applied by Justo Gonzalo in his work of brain dynamics, where a sensory-cerebral correspondence is considered in the formulation of the \\"development of the sensory field due to a psychophysical isomorphism\\" (pag. 23 of the English translation of ref.). Both ideas 'principle of totality' and 'psychophysical isomorphism' are particularly relevant in the current climate and have driven researchers to investigate the behavioural benefits of multisensory integration. =Decreasing sensory uncertainty= It has been widely acknowledged that uncertainty in sensory domains results in an increased dependence of multisensory integration. Hence, it follows that cues from multiple modalities that are both temporally and spatially synchronous are viewed neurally and perceptually as emanating from the same source. The degree of synchrony that is required for this 'binding' to occur is currently being investigated in a variety of approaches. The integrative function only occurs to a point beyond which the subject can differentiate them as two opposing stimuli. Concurrently, a significant intermediate conclusion can be drawn from the research thus far. Multisensory stimuli that are bound into a single percept, are also bound on the same receptive fields of multisensory neurons in the SC and cortex. =Decreasing reaction time= Responses to multiple simultaneous sensory stimuli can be faster than responses to the same stimuli presented in isolation. Hershenson (1962) presented a light and tone simultaneously and separately, and asked human participants to respond as rapidly as possible to them. As the asynchrony between the onsets of both stimuli was varied, it was observed that for certain degrees of asynchrony, reaction times were decreased. These levels of asynchrony were quite small, perhaps reflecting the temporal window that exists in multisensory neurons of the SC. Further studies have analysed the reaction times of saccadic eye movements; and more recently correlated these findings to neural phenomena. In patients studied by Gonzalo, with lesions in the parieto-occipital cortex, the decrease in the reaction time to a given stimulus by means of intersensory facilitation was shown to be very remarkable. Redundant target effects The redundant target effect is the observation that people typically respond faster to double targets (two targets presented simultaneously) than to either of the targets presented alone. This difference in latency is termed the redundancy gain (RG). In a study done by Forster, Cavina-Pratesi, Aglioti, and Berlucchi (2001), normal observers responded faster to simultaneous visual and tactile stimuli than to single visual or tactile stimuli. RT to simultaneous visual and tactile stimuli was also faster than RT to simultaneous dual visual or tactile stimuli. The advantage for RT to combined visual-tactile stimuli over RT to the other types of stimulation could be accounted for by intersensory neural facilitation rather than by probability summation. These effects can be ascribed to the convergence of tactile and visual inputs onto neural centers which contain flexible multisensory representations of body parts. =Multisensory illusions=McGurk effect It has been found that two converging bimodal stimuli can produce a perception that is not only different in magnitude than the sum of its parts, but also quite different in quality. In a classic study labeled the McGurk effect, a person's phoneme production was dubbed with a video of that person speaking a different phoneme. The end result was the perception of a third, different phoneme. McGurk and MacDonald (1976) explained that phonemes such as ba, da, ka, ta, ga and pa can be divided into four groups, those that can be visually confused, i.e. (da, ga, ka, ta) and (ba and pa), and those that can be audibly confused. Hence, when ba – voice and ga lips are processed together, the visual modality sees ga or da, and the auditory modality hears ba or da, combining to form the percept da. Ventriloquism Ventriloquism has been used as the evidence for the modality appropriateness hypothesis. Ventriloquism is the situation in which auditory location perception is shifted toward a visual cue. The original study describing this phenomenon was conducted by Howard and Templeton, (1966) after which several studies have replicated and built upon the conclusions they reached. In conditions in which the visual cue is unambiguous, visual capture reliably occurs. Thus to test the influence of sound on perceived location, the visual stimulus must be progressively degraded. Furthermore, given that auditory stimuli are more attuned to temporal changes, recent studies have tested the ability of temporal characteristics to influence the spatial location of visual stimuli. Some types of EVP – electronic voice phenomenon, mainly the ones using sound bubbles are considered a kind of modern ventriloquism technique and is played by the use of sophisticated software, computers and sound equipment. Double-flash illusion The double flash illusion was reported as the first illusion to show that visual stimuli can be qualitatively altered by audio stimuli. In the standard paradigm participants are presented combinations of one to four flashes accompanied by zero to 4 beeps. They were then asked to say how many flashes they perceived. Participants perceived illusory flashes when there were more beeps than flashes. fMRI studies have shown that there is crossmodal activation in early, low level visual areas, which was qualitatively similar to the perception of a real flash. This suggests that the illusion reflects subjective perception of the extra flash. Further, studies suggest that timing of multisensory activation in unisensory cortexes is too fast to be mediated by a higher order integration suggesting feed forward or lateral connections. One study has revealed the same effect but from vision to audition, as well as fission rather than fusion effects, although the level of the auditory stimulus was reduced to make it less salient for those illusions affecting audition. Rubber hand illusion In the rubber hand illusion (RHI), human participants view a dummy hand being stroked with a paintbrush, while they feel a series of identical brushstrokes applied to their own hand, which is hidden from view. If this visual and tactile information is applied synchronously, and if the visual appearance and position of the dummy hand is similar to one's own hand, then people may feel that the touches on their own hand are coming from the dummy hand, and even that the dummy hand is, in some way, their own hand. This is an early form of body transfer illusion. The RHI is an illusion of vision, touch, and posture (proprioception), but a similar illusion can also be induced with touch and proprioception. It has also been found that the illusion may not require tactile stimulation at all, but can be completely induced using mere vision of the rubber hand being in a congruent posture with the hidden real hand. The very first report of this kind of illusion may have been as early as 1937 (Tastevin, 1937). (English abstract) Body transfer illusion Body transfer illusion typically involves the use of virtual reality devices to induce the illusion in the subject that the body of another person or being is the subject's own body. Neural mechanismsSubcortical areas=Superior colliculus Superior colliculus The superior colliculus (SC) or optic tectum (OT) is part of the tectum, located in the midbrain, superior to the brainstem and inferior to the thalamus. It contains seven layers of alternating white and grey matter, of which the superficial contain topographic maps of the visual field; and deeper layers contain overlapping spatial maps of the visual, auditory and somatosensory modalities. The structure receives afferents directly from the retina, as well as from various regions of the cortex (primarily the occipital lobe), the spinal cord and the inferior colliculus. It sends efferents to the spinal cord, cerebellum, thalamus and occipital lobe via the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). The structure contains a high proportion of multisensory neurons and plays a role in the motor control of orientation behaviours of the eyes, ears and head. Receptive fields from somatosensory, visual and auditory modalities converge in the deeper layers to form a two-dimensional multisensory map of the external world. Here, objects straight ahead are represented caudally and objects on the periphery are represented rosterally. Similarly, locations in superior sensory space are represented medially, and inferior locations are represented laterally. However, in contrast to simple convergence, the SC integrates information to create an output that differs from the sum of its inputs. Following a phenomenon labelled the 'spatial rule', neurons are excited if stimuli from multiple modalities fall on the same or adjacent receptive fields, but are inhibited if the stimuli fall on disparate fields. Excited neurons may then proceed to innervate various muscles and neural structures to orient an individual's behaviour and attention toward the stimulus. Neurons in the SC also adhere to the 'temporal rule', in which stimulation must occur within close temporal proximity to excite neurons. However, due to the varying processing time between modalities and the relatively slower speed of sound to light, it has been found the neurons may be optimally excited when stimulated some time apart. Putamen Single neurons in the macaque putamen have been shown to have visual and somatosensory responses closely related to those in the polysensory zone of the premotor cortex and area 7b in the parietal lobe. =Cortical areas= Multisensory neurons exist in a large number of locations, often integrated with unimodal neurons. They have recently been discovered in areas previously thought to be modality specific, such as the somatosensory cortex; as well as in clusters at the borders between the major cerebral lobes, such as the occipito-parietal space and the occipito-temporal space. However, in order to undergo such physiological changes, there must exist continuous connectivity between these multisensory structures. It is generally agreed that information flow within the cortex follows a hierarchical configuration. Hubel and Wiesel showed that receptive fields and thus the function of cortical structures, as one proceeds out from V1 along the visual pathways, become increasingly complex and specialized. From this it was postulated that information flowed outwards in a feed forward fashion; the complex end products eventually binding to form a percept. However, via fMRI and intracranial recording technologies, it has been observed that the activation time of successive levels of the hierarchy does not correlate with a feed forward structure. That is, late activation has been observed in the striate cortex, markedly after activation of the prefrontal cortex in response to the same stimulus. Complementing this, afferent nerve fibres have been found that project to early visual areas such as the lingual gyrus from late in the dorsal (action) and ventral (perception) visual streams, as well as from the auditory association cortex. Feedback projections have also been observed in the opossum directly from the auditory association cortex to V1. This last observation currently highlights a point of controversy within the neuroscientific community. Sadato et al. (2004) concluded, in line with Bernstein et al. (2002), that the primary auditory cortex (A1) was functionally distinct from the auditory association cortex, in that it was void of any interaction with the visual modality. They hence concluded that A1 would not at all be effected by cross modal plasticity. This concurs with Jones and Powell's (1970) contention that primary sensory areas are connected only to other areas of the same modality. In contrast, the dorsal auditory pathway, projecting from the temporal lobe is largely concerned with processing spatial information, and contains receptive fields that are topographically organized. Fibers from this region project directly to neurons governing corresponding receptive fields in V1. The perceptual consequences of this have not yet been empirically acknowledged. However, it can be hypothesized that these projections may be the precursors of increased acuity and emphasis of visual stimuli in relevant areas of perceptual space. Consequently, this finding rejects Jones and Powell's (1970) hypothesis and thus is in conflict with Sadato et al.'s (2004) findings. A resolution to this discrepancy includes the possibility that primary sensory areas can not be classified as a single group, and thus may be far more different from what was previously thought. The multisensory syndrome with symmetric bilaterality, characterized by Gonzalo and called by this author \`central syndrome of the cortex', was originated from a unilateral parieto-occipital cortical lesion equidistant from the visual, tactile, and auditory projection areas (the middle of area 19, the anterior part of area 18 and the most posterior of area 39, in Brodmann terminology) that was called \`central zone'. The gradation observed between syndromes led this author to propose a functional gradient scheme in which the specificity of the cortex is distributed with a continuous variation, the overlap of the specific gradients would be high or maximum in that \` central zone'. Further research is necessary for a definitive resolution. Frontal lobe Area F4 in macaques Area F5 in macaques Polysensory zone of premotor cortex (PZ) in macaques Occipital lobe Primary visual cortex (V1) Lingual gyrus in humans Lateral occipital complex (LOC), including lateral occipital tactile visual area (LOtv) Parietal lobe Ventral intraparietal sulcus (VIP) in macaques Lateral intraparietal sulcus (LIP) in macaques Area 7b in macaques Second somatosensory cortex (SII) Temporal lobe Primary auditory cortex (A1) Superior temporal cortex (STG/STS/PT) Audio visual cross modal interactions are known to occur in the auditory association cortex which lies directly inferior to the Sylvian fissure in the temporal lobe. Plasticity was observed in the superior temporal gyrus (STG) by Petitto et al. (2000). Here, it was found that the STG was more active during stimulation in native deaf signers compared to hearing non signers. Concurrently, further research has revealed differences in the activation of the Planum temporale (PT) in response to non linguistic lip movements between the hearing and deaf; as well as progressively increasing activation of the auditory association cortex as previously deaf participants gain hearing experience via a cochlear implant. Anterior ectosylvian sulus (AES) in cats Rostral lateral suprasylvian sulcus (rLS) in cats =Cortical- subcortical interactions= The most significant interaction between these two systems (corticotectal interactions) is the connection between the anterior ectosylvian sulcus (AES), which lies at the junction of the parietal, temporal and frontal lobes, and the SC. The AES is divided into three unimodal regions with multisensory neurons at the junctions between these sections. (Jiang & Stein, 2003). Neurons from the unimodal regions project to the deep layers of the SC and influence the multiplicative integration effect. That is, although they can receive inputs from all modalities as normal, the SC can not enhance or depress the effect of multisensory stimulation without input from the AES. Concurrently, the multisensory neurons of the AES, although also integrally connected to unimodal AES neurons, are not directly connected to the SC. This pattern of division is reflected in other areas of the cortex, resulting in the observation that cortical and tectal multisensory systems are somewhat dissociated. Stein, London, Wilkinson and Price (1996) analysed the perceived luminance of an LED in the context of spatially disparate auditory distracters of various types. A significant finding was that a sound increased the perceived brightness of the light, regardless of their relative spatial locations, provided the light's image was projected onto the fovea. Here, the apparent lack of the spatial rule, further differentiates cortical and tectal multisensory neurons. Little empirical evidence exists to justify this dichotomy. Nevertheless, cortical neurons governing perception, and a separate sub cortical system governing action (orientation behavior) is synonymous with the perception action hypothesis of the visual stream. Further investigation into this field is necessary before any substantial claims can be made. =Dual \\"what\\" and \\"where\\" multisensory routes= Research suggests the existence of two multisensory routes for \\"what\\" and \\"where\\". The \\"what\\" route identifying the identity of things involving area Brodmann area 9 in the right inferior frontal gyrus and right middle frontal gyrus, Brodmann area 13 and Brodmann area 45 in the right insula-inferior frontal gyrus area, and Brodmann area 13 bilaterally in the insula. The \\"where\\" route detecting their spatial attributes involving the Brodmann area 40 in the right and left inferior parietal lobule and the Brodmann area 7 in the right precuneus-superior parietal lobule and Brodmann area 7 in the left superior parietal lobule. Development of multisensory operations Theories of development = All species equipped with multiple sensory systems, utilize them in an integrative manner to achieve action and perception. However, in most species, especially higher mammals and humans, the ability to integrate develops in parallel with physical and cognitive maturity. Children until certain ages do not show mature integration patterns. Classically, two opposing views that are principally modern manifestations of the nativist/empiricist dichotomy have been put forth. The integration (empiricist) view states that at birth, sensory modalities are not at all connected. Hence, it is only through active exploration that plastic changes can occur in the nervous system to initiate holistic perceptions and actions. Conversely, the differentiation (nativist) perspective asserts that the young nervous system is highly interconnected; and that during development, modalities are gradually differentiated as relevant connections are rehearsed and the irrelevant are discarded. Using the SC as a model, the nature of this dichotomy can be analysed. In the newborn cat, deep layers of the SC contain only neurons responding to the somatosensory modality. Within a week, auditory neurons begin to occur, but it is not until two weeks after birth that the first multisensory neurons appear. Further changes continue, with the arrival of visual neurons after three weeks, until the SC has achieved its fully mature structure after three to four months. Concurrently in species of monkey, newborns are endowed with a significant complement of multisensory cells; however, along with cats there is no integration effect apparent until much later. This delay is thought to be the result of the relatively slower development of cortical structures including the AES; which as stated above, is essential for the existence of the integration effect. Furthermore, it was found by Wallace (2004) that cats raised in a light deprived environment had severely underdeveloped visual receptive fields in deep layers of the SC. Although, receptive field size has been shown to decrease with maturity, the above finding suggests that integration in the SC is a function of experience. Nevertheless, the existence of visual multisensory neurons, despite a complete lack of visual experience, highlights the apparent relevance of nativist viewpoints. Multisensory development in the cortex has been studied to a lesser extent, however a similar study to that presented above was performed on cats whose optic nerves had been severed. These cats displayed a marked improvement in their ability to localize stimuli through audition; and consequently also showed increased neural connectivity between V1 and the auditory cortex. Such plasticity in early childhood allows for greater adaptability, and thus more normal development in other areas for those with a sensory deficit. In contrast, following the initial formative period, the SC does not appear to display any neural plasticity. Despite this, habituation and sensititisation over the long term is known to exist in orientation behaviors. This apparent plasticity in function has been attributed to the adaptability of the AES. That is, although neurons in the SC have a fixed magnitude of output per unit input, and essentially operate an all or nothing response, the level of neural firing can be more finely tuned by variations in input by the AES. Although there is evidence for either perspective of the integration/differentiation dichotomy, a significant body of evidence also exists for a combination of factors from either view. Thus, analogous to the broader nativist/empiricist argument, it is apparent that rather than a dichotomy, there exists a continuum, such that the integration and differentiation hypotheses are extremes at either end. = Psychophysical development of integration = Not much is known about the development of the ability to integrate multiple estimates such as vision and touch. Some multisensory abilities are present from early infancy, but it is not until children are eight years or older before they use multiple modalities to reduce sensory uncertainty. One study demonstrated that cross- modal visual and auditory integration is present from within 1 year of life. This study measured response time for orientating towards a source. Infants who were 8–10 months old showed significantly decreased response times when the source was presented through both visual and auditory information compared to a single modality. Younger infants, however, showed no such change in response times to these different conditions. Indeed, the results of the study indicates that children potentially have the capacity to integrate sensory sources at any age. However, in certain cases, for example visual cues, intermodal integration is avoided. Another study found that cross-modal integration of touch and vision for distinguishing size and orientation is available from at least 8 years of age. For pre-integration age groups, one sense dominates depending on the characteristic discerned (see visual dominance). A study investigating sensory integration within a single modality (vision) found that it cannot be established until age 12 and above. This particular study assessed the integration of disparity and texture cues to resolve surface slant. Though younger age groups showed a somewhat better performance when combining disparity and texture cues compared to using only disparity or texture cues, this difference was not statistically significant. In adults, the sensory integration can be mandatory, meaning that they no longer have access to the individual sensory sources. Acknowledging these variations, many hypotheses have been established to reflect why these observations are task-dependent. Given that different senses develop at different rates, it has been proposed that cross-modal integration does not appear until both modalities have reached maturity. The human body undergoes significant physical transformation throughout childhood. Not only is there growth in size and stature (affecting viewing height), but there is also change in inter-ocular distance and eyeball length. Therefore, sensory signals need to be constantly re-evaluated to appreciate these various physiological changes. Some support comes from animal studies that explore the neurobiology behind integration. Adult monkeys have deep inter-neuronal connections within the superior colliculus providing strong, accelerated visuo-auditory integration. Young animals conversely, do not have this enhancement until unimodal properties are fully developed. Additionally, to rationalize sensory dominance, Gori et al. (2008) advocates that the brain utilises the most direct source of information during sensory immaturity. In this case, orientation is primarily a visual characteristic. It can be derived directly from the object image that forms on the retina, irrespective of other visual factors. In fact, data shows that a functional property of neurons within primate visual cortices' are their discernment to orientation. In contrast, haptic orientation judgements are recovered through collaborated patterned stimulations, evidently an indirect source susceptible to interference. Likewise, when size is concerned haptic information coming from positions of the fingers is more immediate. Visual-size perceptions, alternatively, have to be computed using parameters such as slant and distance. Considering this, sensory dominance is a useful instinct to assist with calibration. During sensory immaturity, the more simple and robust information source could be used to tweak the accuracy of the alternate source. Follow-up work by Gori et al. (2012) showed that, at all ages, vision- size perceptions are near perfect when viewing objects within the haptic workspace (i.e. at arm's reach). However, systematic errors in perception appeared when the object was positioned beyond this zone. Children younger than 14 years tend to underestimate object size, whereas adults overestimated. However, if the object was returned to the haptic workspace, those visual biases disappeared. These results support the hypothesis that haptic information may educate visual perceptions. If sources are used for cross- calibration they cannot, therefore, be combined (integrated). Maintaining access to individual estimates is a trade-off for extra plasticity over accuracy, which could be beneficial in retrospect to the developing body. Alternatively, Ernst (2008) advocates that efficient integration initially relies upon establishing correspondence – which sensory signals belong together. Indeed, studies have shown that visuo-haptic integration fails in adults when there is a perceived spatial separation, suggesting sensory information is coming from different targets. Furthermore, if the separation can be explained, for example viewing an object through a mirror, integration is re-established and can even be optimal. Ernst (2008) suggests that adults can obtain this knowledge from previous experiences to quickly determine which sensory sources depict the same target, but young children could be deficient in this area. Once there is a sufficient bank of experiences, confidence to correctly integrate sensory signals can then be introduced in their behaviour. Lastly, Nardini et al. (2010) recently hypothesised that young children have optimized their sensory appreciation for speed over accuracy. When information is presented in two forms, children may derive an estimate from the fastest available source, subsequently ignoring the alternate, even if it contains redundant information. Nardini et al. (2010) provides evidence that children's (aged 6 years) response latencies are significantly lower when stimuli are presented in multi-cue over single-cue conditions. Conversely, adults showed no change between these conditions. Indeed, adults display mandatory fusion of signals, therefore they can only ever aim for maximum accuracy. However, the overall mean latencies for children were not faster than adults, which suggests that speed optimization merely enable them to keep up with the mature pace. Considering the haste of real-world events, this strategy may prove necessary to counteract the general slower processing of children and maintain effective vision-action coupling. Ultimately the developing sensory system may preferentially adapt for different goals – speed and detecting sensory conflicts – those typical of objective learning. The late development of efficient integration has also been investigated from computational point of view. Daee et al. (2014) showed that having one dominant sensory source at early age, rather than integrating all sources, facilitates the overall development of cross-modal integrations. = Applications = Prosthesis  Prosthetics designers should carefully consider the nature of dimensionality alteration of sensorimotor signaling from and to the CNS when designing prothesitic devices. As reported in literatures, neural signaling from the CNS to the motors is organized in a way that the dimensionalities of the signals are gradually increased as you approach the muscles, also called muscle synergies. In the same principal, but in opposite ordering, on the other hand, signals dimensionalities from the sensory receptors are gradually integrated, also called sensory synergies, as they approaches the CNS. This bow tie like signaling formation enables the CNS to process abstract yet valuable information only. Such as process will decrease complexity of the data, handle the noises and guarantee to the CNS the optimum energy consumption. Although the current commercially available prosthetic devices mainly focusing in implementing the motor side by simply uses EMG sensors to switch between different activation states of the prosthesis. Very limited works have proposed a system to involve by integrating the sensory side. The integration of tactile sense and proprioception is regarded as essential for implementing the ability to perceive environmental input.  Visual Rehabilitation  Multisensory integration has also been shown to ameliorate visual hemianopia. Through the repeated presentation of multisensory stimuli in the blind hemifield, the ability to respond to purely visual stimuli gradually returns to that hemifield in a central to peripheral manner. These benefits persist even after the explicit multisensory training ceases.

Kentlands was one of the first attempts to develop a community using Traditional Neighborhood Design planning techniques (also known as 'neo- traditional new town planning') that are now generally referred to under the rubric of the New Urbanism. (The New Urbanism is the concept of building a walkable, mixed-use city neighborhood or new town to provide an attractive alternative to the spread out, automobile-centric, subdivisions common to post-World War II American suburbia.) Kentlands is built around a farmstead previously owned by Otis Beall Kent. The development, begun in 1988, contains buildings from the original Kentlands farm, many varieties of residences, a \\"downtown\\" commercial district, open space including protected natural areas and pocket parks, and civic uses including schools, a church, clubhouse, pool, tennis and basketball courts, catering facility, and an arts center. Overview Causeway on Lake Inspiration, Kentlands in 2007. The town has a system of artificial lakes that snakes through the community. There are jogging trails that run through the parks and districts of the neighborhood, and the community's commercial areas and the facilities operated by the Assembly, which include swimming pools, tennis courts, playgrounds, performance spaces, and a large clubhouse, are all within walking distance. Kentlands is divided into several districts, including \\"Old Farm\\", built around the historic mansion and the Kentlands Village Square; \\"Gatehouse\\", named after the farm's entry gatehouse, which has been reconstructed; the \\"Hill Districts\\"; the \\"Lakes Districts\\"; \\"Kentlands Bluff\\"; \\"Midtown/Main Street\\"; \\"Market Square\\"; and \\"Kentlands Square\\". The winding street layout is based on a grid pattern, varied as necessary by the requirements of Kentlands topography. Multiple open green spaces and pocket parks have been developed where land was available between the districts or in odd spaces near buildings and dwellings. Market Square, Kentlands Square, and the Boulevard Shops are commercial districts with grocery stores, banks, boutiques, offices, stores, dozens of restaurants, and a 10-screen cinema cafe. Main Street is a mixed-use area with distinctive \\"live-work\\" buildings with retail and office uses on the lower floors and residential uses on the upper floors. City planners, public officials, business owners, and neighborhood residents recently worked with urban designers from the HOK global architecture firm at the 'Kentlands Commercial District Charrette,' in which a plan was developed for an intensified mixed-use and transit-oriented 'Downtown Kentlands.' The proposals developed in the charrette are now winding their way through the City of Gaithersburg's master planning process. An ice cream truck driving through Kentlands in 2005. Kentlands, along with its sister community Lakelands, is among the largest and arguably most successful of the New Urbanist projects. More than 8,000 residents now live in Kentlands and Lakelands, with office and commercial development totaling more than . Rachel Carson Elementary School is at one entrance to the community and Lakelands Park Middle School divides the newer development of Lakelands from the former National Geographic complex that is adjacent to it, now occupied by Montgomery County Regional Services Center and the Montgomery County Liquor Control Board Warehouse. Throughout the year, community events take place in and around the Kentlands organized by community members. These include the Kentlands/Lakelands 5K race, the Oktoberfest in the Kentlands, the Fourth of July Parade, film festivals, and acoustic jams. History Kentlands is built on a former farm estate that had its origins in a 1723 land grant to Joseph West. In the mid-18th century, Henry Clagett, a prosperous farmer, acquired much of this land for his holdings. When Clagett died in 1777, several sections of this property passed to his son, Joseph. The Tschiffely family began to farm the land in 1852, when Frederick A. Tschiffely, who owned a prominent wholesale pharmaceutical business in Washington, D.C., purchased more than of land from the Clagett heirs. In 1900, his son, also named Frederick A. Tschiffely, built the impressive brick mansion, barn, gatehouse, overseer's house, greenhouse and chicken coop that gave the property the nickname of \\"The Bricks\\". The family called their estate Wheatlands, after the wheat that was grown on the farm, and raised their eight children in the mansion. Mr. Tschiffely was the largest wholesale pharmaceutical distributor in the Washington area and owner of Washington's best-known pharmacy. His daily commute to Washington began with a horse and buggy drive to the Gaithersburg train station. In 1942, the Tschiffely family sold the land to Otis Beall Kent. Kent, a wealthy tax lawyer, renamed the land 'Kentlands Farm', and he set about to create a gentleman's estate and wildlife sanctuary. In the 1960s, part of the land was given to the Izaak Walton League and the National Geographic Society with conditions of maintaining much of the land as a wildlife sanctuary. Mr. Kent bequeathed the remainder of the property to his adopted daughter, Helene Danger Kent. That portion was annexed into the city of Gaithersburg and was sold in 1988 to the town creator, Joe Alfandre. Alfandre, a developer, brought in Andres Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk (partners in what was then called DPZ), urban planners credited with designing the town of Seaside, Florida. After the June 1988 Kentlands charrette, several historic buildings were donated to the city. The neighborhood was built in a process that involved several additional charrettes. As the project was nearing completion, a sister development, named Lakelands, was built adjacent to Kentlands. Lakelands also was designed in a charrette process including the DPZ team, the city staff, and local residents. Construction started in 1989, and the first model homes opened in mid-1990. The first Kentlands residents moved into new homes in 1991. A number of historic landmarks from the original Kent Farm were refurbished and donated to the city. The Kentlands Mansion, the main residence of the farm owners and the center of historic Kentlands Farm, is now a city- owned venue for art exhibits, concerts, and public events, and is available as a rental for private parties and meetings. The Kentlands Barn has been converted into a public arts center with studios, exhibit space, and a 99-seat theater used for theatrical performances and concerts. The former farm manager's house has been transformed into a private residence, another farm building into the town architect's office, and another building was sold to the Kentlands Citizens Assembly — Kentlands' administrative body — which converted it into a meeting place, exhibit hall, and the headquarters of the Kentlands Community Foundation. The old Kentlands Firehouse, garden buildings, a \\"peacock house,\\" and other historic artifacts have not yet been restored, while some ruins have become part of privately owned property or city parks. Near the end of the 2010s, the Market Square began to undergo major redevelopment. In early 2018, the center's movie theater, Paragon Theaters Kentlands, closed in favor of a new, premium theater that was part of the Mexican Cinepolis luxury theater chain, which is expected to open in mid September 2019, with new restaurants and stores opening at the square earlier in that year.

The pudendal nerve block prevents fainting during forceps delivery which was common before pudendal nerve block use was available. The anesthesia is produced by blocking the pudendal nerves near the ischial spine of the pelvis. The ischial spine separates the greater and lesser sciatic foramina at the exit of the bony pelvis. The pudendal block gets its name because a local anesthetic, such as lidocaine or chloroprocaine, is injected into the pudendal canal where the pudendal nerve is located. This allows quick pain relief to the perineum, vulva, and vagina. A pudendal block is usually given in the second stage of labor just before delivery of the baby. It relieves pain around the vagina and rectum as the baby comes down the birth canal. It is also helpful just before an episiotomy. Lidocaine is usually preferred for a pudendal block because it has a longer duration than chloroprocaine which usually lasts less than one hour.

The song was copyrighted in the United States by entertainer Morey Amsterdam and was a hit in 1945 for the Andrews Sisters. History The song was published in the United States with Amsterdam listed as lyricist and Jeri Sullivan and Paul Baron as composers. The melody had been previously published as the work of Venezuelan calypso composer Lionel Belasco on a song titled \\"L'Année Passée,\\" which was in turn based on a folk song from Martinique. The lyrics to \\"Rum and Coca-Cola\\" were written by Rupert Grant, another calypso musician from Trinidad who used the stage name Lord Invader. The song became a local hit and was at the peak of its popularity when Amsterdam visited the island in September 1943 as part of a U.S.O. tour. Although he claimed never to have heard the song during the month he spent on the island, the lyrics to his version are clearly based on the Lord Invader version, with the music and chorus being virtually identical. However, Amsterdam's version strips the song of its social commentary. The Lord Invader version laments that U.S. soldiers are debauching local women who \\"saw that the Yankees treat them nice/and they give them a better price.\\" Its final stanza describes a newlywed couple whose marriage is ruined when \\"the bride run away with a soldier lad/and the stupid husband went staring mad.\\" The Amsterdam version also hints that women are prostituting themselves, preserving the Lord Invader chorus which says, \\"Both mother and daughter/Working for the Yankee dollar.\\" The Andrews Sisters also seem to have given little thought to the meaning of the lyrics. According to Patty Andrews, \\"We had a recording date, and the song was brought to us the night before the recording date. We hardly really knew it, and when we went in we had some extra time and we just threw it in, and that was the miracle of it. It was actually a faked arrangement. There was no written background, so we just kind of faked it.\\" In under ten minutes they made a record that sold seven million units and sat at number one on the Billboard magazine chart for seven weeks. Maxine Andrews recalled, \\"The rhythm was what attracted the Andrews Sisters to 'Rum and Coca-Cola'. We never thought of the lyric. The lyric was there, it was cute, but we didn't think of what it meant; but at that time, nobody else would think of it either, because we weren't as morally open as we are today and so, a lot of stuff—really, no excuses—just went over our heads.\\" Some stations refused to play the song because it mentioned rum, and alcohol couldn't be advertised on the air. In the Songs That Won The War Vol. 8 Swing Again, Yes Indeed! CD program notes, Edward Habib writes, \\"'Rum and Coca Cola' has naughty lyrics but not quite naughty enough to deny its hit status...During the forties, comedians as songwriters was the norm, Phil Silvers, Joey Bishop and Jackie Gleason all had a part in writing hit songs. While there were a number of records of 'Rum and Coca Cola', the Andrews Sisters' version was far and away the most popular.\\" After the release of \\"Rum and Coca-Cola\\", Belasco and Lord Invader sued for copyright infringement of the song's music and lyrics, respectively. In 1948, after years of litigation, both plaintiffs won their cases, with Lord Invader receiving an award of $150,000 in owed royalties. However, Morey Amsterdam was allowed to retain copyright to the song. Lord Invader also wrote a follow-up song to \\"Rum and Coca-Cola\\", titled \\"Yankee Dollar\\". Calypsonian and Calypso Monarch winner, Devon Seale, first premiered his tribute to Lionel Belasco entitled \\"Lio\\", at the Calypso Revue tent in 1999. That year, he would take it to the annual Calyspo Monarch finals. In the tribute, Seale references the Andrew Sisters' recording of \\"Rum and Coca-Cola\\" and the winning copyright case. He sings, \\"I bring evidence quick to show them that I write the song in 1906\\", and \\"thirty years later Invader changed the lyrics ... I am Lio-Lionel Belasco.\\" Since the Andrew Sisters' release, many other artists have shared their renditions of the popular tune, including American singer-songwriter, Harry Belafonte.

She first appeared on 29 April 2004 as the second wife of the show's \\"most enduring character\\", Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), becoming a prominent regular for the next 18 months. Chrissie Watts was created by the production team to be more the \\"equal\\" of her notorious and villainous husband than his long-suffering first wife, Angie (Anita Dobson). The character was described by Oberman as being like Angie \\"but with 15 more years of feminism behind her\\". Chrissie became well known for her deviousness and \\"scheming\\", echoing the traits of her husband, who is \\"happy to play mind games\\" and \\"often two steps ahead\\" of Den. As part of the Watts family, her storylines centre on her tumultuous marriage to Den, her relationship with his children, and the ongoing feud with the rival Mitchell family. She was involved in numerous clashes with other female character and was constantly scheming against those who got in her way, earning her the sobriquet of \\"super-bitch\\". In 2005, Chrissie was the focus of one of \\"the programme's biggest and most high-profile narratives\\" when she murdered her husband in a fit of rage during the special 20th anniversary episode. The broadcast, airing on 18 February, was watched by 14.34 million people, with \\"almost 60% of possible viewers\\" tuning in to see Chrissie take revenge. The character was credited by former head of BBC Drama Serials, Mal Young, as \\"anchoring the success of the anniversary storyline\\", and was described on the news programme BBC Breakfast as the \\"centrepiece\\" of the show, with the on-screen drama playing out over the course of the year, propelling her into the role of the show’s primary antagonist, and culminating in Chrissie's departure on 9 December 2005. Storylines Chrissie arrives in Walford in search of her husband, Den Watts (Leslie Grantham). Their marriage has turned sour and he has sold their bar in Spain and taken the money. Den manages to persuade her to give their marriage another try, and to stay in Walford with him. She is shocked to discover he has children, Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean), Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman) and Vicki Fowler (Scarlett Johnson), and that while he was in Spain with her, he was in exile after faking his own death. She starts work as a hairdresser in Kate Mitchell's (Jill Halfpenny) nail salon and helps stepdaughter Vicki with her plans to enter fashion school. However, Den's elusive behaviour raises her suspicions that he is having an affair. He almost convinces her that she is mistaken, but she eventually learns that her fears were correct and uncovers the affair between Den and Kate. Feigning friendship, she hacks off most of Kate's hair and smashes up the beauty salon in a rage. She leaves Walford distraught at Den's betrayal. Den departs for Spain on business, and Chrissie returns to the salon as she remains the co- owner. She remains hostile to Kate for some time, but eventually calls a truce. She then becomes concerned over Vicki's much older boyfriend Tommy Grant (Robert Cavanah), and exposes him as a liar. At this point, Den returns intent on securing her forgiveness. However, she does not succumb to his charm offensive, and so as a demonstration of his affection he confides in her of his plans to bankrupt the Mitchell family and take control of The Queen Victoria public house, declaring that he can't do it without her. She relents, but warns if he ever cheats again she will kill him. Together, they scam the Mitchell family out of their holdings and move into the Vic on Christmas Day, 2004. In January, Dennis catches Den and his girlfriend Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan) in bed together and tells Chrissie who is stunned. Zoe discovers she is pregnant by Den. Chrissie persuades her to abort the baby, and later reveals that she knows it was Den's baby. Together, Chrissie and Zoe team up with their friend Sam Mitchell (Kim Medcalf) to exact revenge on Den for good; Chrissie for his lies and adultery, Zoe for forcing her to fake a pregnancy and then sleep with him, and Sam for losing her pub to Den in a corrupt scheme that both he and Chrissie were involved in. Chrissie plans to intimidate Den into signing the pub over to her. They confront Den but he takes it in his stride and openly talks about his sins, unaware that Sharon is hiding at the other side of the pub, listening to her father's confessions. Sharon berates Chrissie for tricking her into coming back to Walford with the lie that her father is ill. She storms out of the pub and Den follows. Chrissie knows that Sharon is the one person Den truly loves and cares about and knows that losing Den the love of his favourite child will destroy him. Den walks back in and she taunts him that he now knows what it is like to lose what he loves most. Unable to contain his rage, Den attacks his wife and hits her head against a fruit machine. Zoe picks up the nearest object (a metal, dog-shaped doorstop) and hits Den over the head with it and he falls to the ground. Perceiving him to be dead, Zoe and Sam go out the back to turn all the lights off and lock all the doors. A smug Chrissie starts to gloat that Den is dead, as if to say she has won. Den suddenly grabs her leg and hisses, \\"You'll never get me out of The Vic.\\" so Chrissie picks up the doorstop and delivers a fatal blow to his head, secretly watched by Sam. The three women bury him in a hole in the pub's cellar, which is filled with cement the next morning. Den's body during the 20th anniversary episode. Consolidated figures reveal the episode was seen by over 17 million viewers (nearly 1/3 of the British population). Despite knowing that she is innocent, Chrissie allows Zoe to believe that she has killed Den. Consequently, a power struggle breaks out between Sam – who wants her pub back in return for her silence – and Chrissie, with each woman trying to gain control of Zoe. In the meantime, Chrissie publicly accounts for Den's sudden absence by declaring that he has run off with another woman and attempts to make her story convincing by throwing his clothes into the street and engaging in a bogus phone conversation with him in front of a packed pub. She successfully removes Zoe from the Square for a time, and begins a relationship with Jake Moon (Joel Beckett); however, Sam has taken the doorstop and hidden it in her flat. She then proceeds to blackmail Chrissie by saying that unless the pub is given back to her, she will inform the police. Chrissie stalls for time, and eventually calls Sam's bluff, declaring that she will take Sam down with her if she goes to the police. Desperate, Sam tries to corner Chrissie by telling Zoe the truth. Zoe confronts Chrissie before fleeing to Spain, telling her mother Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) what has happened before she goes. Dennis and Sharon return to Walford in search of their father. On their wedding day, a drunken Sam grows frustrated and smashes up Den's grave and digs up his body in the hope that Chrissie will be sent down for his death. This backfires and Sam is arrested on suspicion of murder as Den's bloodstains are found under her sink and her story constantly changes. Chrissie asks Kat to get her cousin, Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner), to give a false alibi that Zoe and Chrissie were with her on the night Den died, and Kat agrees as it means that Zoe is safe from the police. Sam's mother, Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor), returns to Walford to free Sam, and slaps Chrissie during Den's funeral. The slap causes Chrissie to fall into Den's grave on top of the coffin. Chrissie plans to sell the pub to Johnny Allen (Billy Murray) and a mystery second buyer, and flee the country, although Phil and Grant Mitchell try to taunt her. Chrissie though, is unfazed, as Sharon still supports her – however, Grant finally convinces Sharon to visit Sam in prison. Sharon still believes Chrissie is innocent, but finally learns the truth when Chrissie makes an innocuous, but telling, comment. Realising that Sharon knows, Chrissie becomes distraught as she felt that so long as Sharon, Den's daughter, thought well of her, she could think well of herself. Panicking, she begins to make mistakes, arguing with Jake outside of Johnny's club. Chrissie had confessed her role in Den's death to Jake, and lets information regarding her guilt slip as they argue. This is caught on CCTV by Johnny, who delights in telling Jake that he has a recording. Chrissie asks to get the money for The Queen Victoria right away, and Johnny takes advantage, saying the only way she will get the money is if she sleeps with him. Chrissie resists, saying that she will not hurt Jake. Johnny tells her that she will not receive the money, and tells Phil and Grant about the tape. Chrissie discovers that Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) is the mystery buyer of the pub, and she and Jake make a quick sale to Ian before fleeing the Square. At the airport, they see Sharon, Phil and Grant with the police. Sharon confronts and then punches Chrissie, who is then arrested for Den's murder. Chrissie says that she will only co-operate in exchange for a meeting with Sharon. This is earned, and she tries to make Sharon realise why she killed her father, to no avail. She reveals that she forged Den's signature on the document in which Den handed over the pub to Chrissie, thus the pub legally belongs to Sharon. Jake visits Chrissie in jail and asks her to marry him. She finds out that he has lost the £25,000 that was to be her bail money, and storms out of the visiting room, calling Jake an idiot. She begins plotting revenge on Sharon for sending her to prison by trying to force her to testify in court about what Den was really like, wanting to see Sharon crumble at confessing how he cheated and supposedly beat her mother (which he never did). After a week in prison, she gives up and dismisses her solicitor, and decides to plead guilty to murder. After an emotional farewell to Jake, she walks into her cell with a contented smile. Chrissie is mentioned in 2006 during an argument between Jake and Ruby Allen (Louisa Lytton) about Johnny's death. Ruby later mentions how Jake was in a relationship with Chrissie and how he helped her cover up Den's murder, to which he insists that it was an accident and that she didn't mean to kill him. Though Chrissie has not been seen or heard of since, when Sam (now played by Danniella Westbrook) returns to Walford in September 2009, she is arrested for her role in Den's murder and expresses a fear of running into Chrissie in prison. Creation and casting The creation of a second wife for Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), the show's \\"most enduring character\\" and \\"one of the best-loved villains in soap history\\", came 15 years after his first wife had departed the screen. Angie Watts (Anita Dobson) was an iconic character in British television history, with her troublesome marriage to Den largely anchoring EastEnders extraordinary success when it was launched in the mid-80s. In an interview shortly after she first appeared on-screen as Chrissie Watts, Tracy-Ann Oberman noted how coming into the show after Angie was an intimidating prospect and \\"a big act to follow\\". Casting for the character was hectic, with Oberman describing the process as a \\"whirlwind\\" affair. The role of the second Mrs Den Watts was highly sought after with Oberman eventually beating out high-profile stars like Patsy Kensit, Cheryl Baker and Joanna Lumley for the part. In a 2004 'Star Chat' interview featured in The People, Oberman commented on her casting: \\"I couldn't have wished for a better part. I mean the Watts family are a national institution. When I realised I was auditioning for the role of Dirty Den's wife, my jaw just dropped. I never thought I'd get it. Amazing, swanky actresses, like Joanna Lumley and Patsy Kensit, were all considered, but Leslie Grantham and I had great chemistry from the off and I think he said: 'I want her.'\\" Oberman was on holiday when she received a call saying she had been cast in the role and was required to be on set the next Tuesday. All told the audition process had taken just two weeks, with Oberman beginning filming a mere ten days after her initial screen test. In fact the schedule was so tight that Oberman was on set and taping scenes before a contract had even been signed. The arrival of Chrissie Watts was announced barely a month before she was set to first appear on-screen, and came at a time when EastEnders was undergoing immense media criticism and falling ratings. The rush of casting meant Oberman had little time to process the enormity of the part she had taken on, declaring: \\"my feet haven't even touched the ground yet. [...] I haven't had time to think about what this role is going to do to my life! I'm very excited to be part of such a fantastic show and one I have been a fan of for many years.\\" She admitted, however, to being \\"slightly intimidated\\" by the high media profile and press interest surrounding the show at the time. Indeed, joining EastEnders \\"proved to be something of a baptism of fire for Oberman\\", as she was playing opposite Leslie Grantham whose recent return to the show had been a highly publicised event. Twenty-four hours after Chrissie's first episode went to air a scandal surrounding Grantham hit the tabloid papers. According to Oberman, the atmosphere on set the next day \\"was a bit tense\\" but, she added, \\"the Watts are pulling together and we're getting on with it and working\\". Looking back on the incident after she had left EastEnders, Oberman remarked, \\"I respect Leslie for fronting it out; he emerged from his dressing room and started working. No one mentioned the story. That's life in EastEnders; the machine never stops.\\" The increasing prominence of Chrissie in EastEnders meant that Oberman, more than most, had to endure the gruelling schedule of working on a soap, taping up to twenty scenes a day. Although she was only in EastEnders for 18 months, such was the centrality of Chrissie to the show and storylines Oberman felt she had done 4 years worth of acting, noting that by the time of her departure \\"Chrissie has packed into a year what most soap characters do in three.\\" This all came during a period of great uncertainty for the show; media criticism and negative publicity created immense pressure behind-the-scenes, with large-scale cast culls and speculation in the press and on the set over who may be next. In an interview with the Sunday Mirror, Oberman described the atmosphere as like a \\"vacuum\\", with the cast \\"just waiting to see what the next stage is – It can be a bit tense but it's exciting. I really don't know what's going to happen.\\" However, the prominent role of Chrissie in the show as it moved forward meant that Oberman came out of the uncertainty with more to show than most, receiving an improved deal and extending her contract for a year, with the BBC's head of drama John Yorke declaring he had \\"big plans\\" for Chrissie. Character developmentPersonality= Unlike Den's first wife Angie, Chrissie \\"has a strong will and fights for what she wants\\". However, as Oberman noted, \\"there is enough of Angie in Chrissie to see that Den likes a certain type of strong woman. Chrissie is Angie with 15 years of feminism behind her\\", explaining in an interview with Radio 4: \\"I like to think of Chrissie as Angie with benefits... She's his [Den's] equal a bit more than Angie was.\\" Oberman later expanded: \\"Chrissie, unlike Angie, won't hit the bottle as soon as Den starts playing away. She's proved she's ready to sit and wait for her revenge. She's a great, strong character\\". Talking to the Daily Mirror shortly after appearing on-screen for the first time in April, Oberman declared, \\"Chrissie is the sort of woman I'd really like to be friends with... She's an Essex girl who was brought up in a family of brothers, so she knows how to work men. She understands that what they say is not always what they mean.\\" In her official character profile, Chrissie is portrayed as someone \\"happy to play mind games\\" and \\"often two steps ahead of her husband\\", being described as \\"the type of person to be your best friend. But if you cross her, she'll get her own back in the end.\\" Her strong-willed persona has led reviewers to label the character as \\"venomous\\", \\"devious\\", and \\"hard as nails\\" in \\"the grand tradition of landladies of the Queen Vic\\", manipulating others to ensure matters go her way. As the \\"scheming\\" figure of the show, she was described as a \\"witch\\" and \\"super-bitch\\", but was also represented as \\"strong\\" and \\"clever\\" woman. Executive producer Kate Harwood characterised Chrissie as a survivor, someone who \\"thinks on her feet\\" whatever the situation. Oberman has stated that she was thrilled to be \\"playing such a strong female character\\", whom she described as not a bad person at heart but one willing to stand and \\"fight in her corner\\". Chrissie's style was a prominent aspect of the character. Tracy-Ann Oberman wanted to bring an element of Sex and the City to the character.An aspect of Chrissie's personality is her wardrobe and style, with EastEnders costume designer Di Humphreys noting that \\"Chrissie's clothes reflect her strong, upfront character.\\" Oberman explained how the character's fashion sense was informed by her own observations of British expatriates: \\"When I heard I had the part of Chrissie I was on holiday in Spain, where she had been living, and I remember looking at all the ex-pat women, and thinking how co-ordinated they are. Their hair is always perfect, their bags match their gloves and shoes and scarves.\\" The show's make-up artist, Elizabeth Armistead, has also spoken of the way Chrissie's \\"glamorous, polished look\\" informs her characterisation and personality: \\"Chrissie's a confident person who rarely leaves anything to chance. Even in moments of despair, though her facial expression reflects her turmoil, she never has a hair out of place.\\" The look was part of a desire to represent the character as a \\"strong\\" and \\"forceful\\" figure, with one interviewer describing Chrissie as \\"quite flashy\\" and \\"glam\\". According to Humphreys, this is manifested in \\"Chrissie’s outfits, [which] are a mixture of designer and High Street... Chrissie's got a great sense of style. She makes High Street clothes look made to measure.\\" Oberman felt Chrissie's fashion sensibilities to be a critical element of the character: \\"she's like Angie with 15 more years of Sex and The City thrown in\\", referring to an American television serial notable for its fashion. Even before stepping foot on set, Oberman spent eight hours with Humphreys shopping for Chrissie's clothes at Selfridges where they \\"spent a fortune!\\" The character's highly stylised representation on-screen earned Oberman the award for best-dressed soap star in 2005, and reflected Chrissie's new-found role as the \\"voluptuous landlady\\" of The Queen Vic. In the media the character was widely regarded as the show's ultimate femme fatale and resident \\"sex symbol\\", being described by John Dingwall of the Daily Record as Walford's \\"black widow\\". In an interview with the Sunday Mirror, Oberman revealed that she was attracted to the mesh of sexuality and humour in the personality of Chrissie, declaring, \\"What I really like is she's got the sex and dry sarcasm\\". Speaking to the official EastEnders website, she expanded on the importance of Chrissie's sense of humour and wit to her \\"feisty\\" characterisation: \\"What I love about Chrissie is that she's a good strong, funny female character... she's got a really good sense of humour which is necessary to deal with Den. She's very good at wisecracks. Den has the one- liners, but Chrissie bats them right back.\\" Chrissie's barbed and biting remarks became a prominent feature of the character; even when cornered by Den's adopted daughter Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) after attempting to flee the country, she remarks: \\"You really are your father's daughter, Sharon. No shaking you off either.\\" =Mrs Den Watts= Chrissie entered the show as the estranged wife of Den Watts, and was deliberately presented as \\"very different to the first Mrs. Watts.\\" When EastEnders began in 1985 viewers had watched Den's affairs and manipulation gradually take their toll on his wife, Angie, who was unable to compete in the games he played. Chrissie was intended to be a contrast to her predecessor; where Angie turned to alcohol, Chrissie was more Den's \\"equal\\" and could be just as devious and calculating, with Oberman observing how \\"Angie was all knee-jerk reaction, but Chrissie is more of a plotter and schemer – just like Den.\\" Comparing Den's two wives, Oberman remarked: \\"Chrissie's much cooler than Angie. Her motto is, 'revenge is a dish best served cold'. She's tougher than Angie and she can hold it together much better.\\" Indeed, according to Oberman, producers deliberately wanted to take Den's second marriage down a different path to his first; whereas the relationship between Den and Angie had been likened to Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, that between Den and Chrissie was modelled on Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. Like Den, Chrissie had an acerbic tongue and their relationship was marked by verbal fencing in the manner of Hepburn and Tracy: \\"What's great is that they've written Den an equal\\", Oberman noted, \\"It'll be interesting to see their little sparring matches.\\" The attraction was intended to be mutual, unlike Den's one-sided marriage to Angie. Trying to win Chrissie around into giving their marriage another try, Den declared: \\"I know we've got a great relationship even when we're tearing lumps out of each other, you give as good as you get and that's the sort of marriage I've always wanted\\". Commenting on the complicated nature of their relationship, Oberman observed, The equality of their marriage was dramatically underscored towards the end of 2004, when Den, as a sign of faith and in an effort to win back her sympathies, revealed to Chrissie his plans to reclaim The Queen Victoria public house by scamming the rival Mitchell family: \\"If you ever needed proof that we're in this together or how badly I need you in my life, this is it. I wasn't going to show this to another soul, but I'm showing you because you're my wife; because it's me and you together.\\" In an interview with the official EastEnders website, Oberman detailed the background dynamic to Chrissie and Den's relationship as it existed before their appearance on the show: \\"They were a real match for each other and ran a successful wine bar. The couple made a good team, but he was always going off with other women. She'd end up leaving him, but they'd always end up back together.\\" Den's womanising and philandering nature was deliberately set against Chrissie's strong and forceful personality, and culminated on-screen in his affair with Kate Mitchell (Jill Halfpenny). The plot was praised by television editor Ru Green as being one of the \\"better storylines\\" during an otherwise weak year for the show, with media attention at the time profiling Chrissie's dramatic plans for revenge. The climax, which saw Chrissie cut off Kate Mitchell's hair in retribution for the affair, was a highlight for Oberman and an important dramatic milestone for her character: \\"cutting off Jill Halfpenny's hair in the salon... was a really great episode. I loved working with Jill and I think that put Chrissie on the map.\\" Chrissie left Den but was eventually convinced to give their marriage another try. She also saw the ebb and flow of Den and Chrissie's marriage as a reflection of the mental gameplaying that was so prominent in their characterisations: \\"I think there's a challenge in it, and I think she would like to be the one who would ultimately tame him.\\" As Den's equal, Chrissie was intended to be a challenge to his propensity for intellectual games, having already outwitted the show's prior top dog, Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Den had seen little threat in his first wife's aptitude, but considered Chrissie to be \\"as sharp as they come\\". Indeed, Den's extra-marital dalliances were used by writers to showcase and highlight Chrissie's \\"strong-willed persona\\". When Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan) chastised Den for caring only about Chrissie's reaction should she learn of their affair, Den fired back: \\"And so should you. You think I've treated you badly? Well you don't have a clue what's going to happen if she ever finds out! The best thing you can do is keep your mouth shut.\\" =Witches of Walford= In November 2004 it was announced that Leslie Grantham had not renewed his contract and that Den Watts would depart EastEnders in what was described by The Mirror as an \\"explosive\\" and final exit. The storyline became one of \\"the program's biggest and most high-profile narratives\\", dominating the entire year, and made the character of Chrissie Watts the \\"centrepiece\\" of the show. The lead-up to the 20th anniversary episode in February was an immensely high- profile affair, with Imogen Ridgway and Richard Godwin of the Evening Standard dryly observing that \\"unless you've been living on Titan you probably know that EastEnders is 20 years old and Dirty Den is once again leaving Albert Square.\\" Events in the show centre around Chrissie manipulating Sam Mitchell and Zoe Slater in a plot of revenge against Den, the three women being dubbed the \\"Witches of Walford\\" by the popular press in reference to Shakespeare's play, Macbeth. The prelude to Den's death further highlighted and showcased Chrissie's manipulative character and conniving personality in her representation as a \\"strong\\" and \\"forceful\\" figure. When she secretly learns that Zoe is pregnant by Den, she plays on Zoe's insecurities and vulnerabilities and \\"coerces\\" her into having an abortion.Episode synopsis: The pregnancy represented a double blow to Chrissie as Den had always resisted having children with her, and as with Kate Mitchell, Chrissie determines to teach Zoe a harsh lesson about \\"messing with other people's husbands\\". The possessive nature of his wife was noted by Den, who warns Zoe that Chrissie \\"tends to blame the women that lead me astray.\\" The final confrontation between husband and wife played out during the special episode marking the show's 20th anniversary. Such was public interest in the storyline that the production team reportedly took to \\"fiercely guarding\\" scripts, \\"so that even the cast weren't sure how they would play out\\", with \\"the show's producers shooting multiple endings to ensure the cast couldn't leak the plot.\\" During the hour-long broadcast Chrissie leads Sam and Zoe into facing Den, with 14.34 million people watching her deliver the fatal blow to her husband after a violent struggle. Oberman \\"begged the producers to let Chrissie do it to prove she wasn't a sap\\", adding \\"It was a real rush for me.\\" The doggy doorstop prop from the British soap opera EastEnders that was owned by the character Pauline Fowler and was used by Chrissie to kill her husband Den Watts. In the aftermath of Den's death, Chrissie became an increasingly \\"transformed\\" and colder figure, as the character \\"played\\" and \\"spun\\" her way \\"out of every situation\\". She proceeds to trick Zoe into taking the blame for Den's murder, and continuously outmanoeuvres Sam in the latter's efforts to get back the Vic. Oberman felt this to be a noticeable shift in Chrissie's characterisation, with the show's writers taking \\"her down a darker route\\", as in one notable scene depicting Chrissie standing over Den's grave, and confiding to him of her plans. The storyline commenced its conclusion with the return of the Mitchell family to help Sam, who had been framed by Chrissie for the murder of Den; events were to culminate in Chrissie's departure from the show, with producers telling Oberman that when she leaves \\"later this year, it's going to be one of the most explosive storylines ever. Like Den before her, Chrissie had little trouble outsmarting the Mitchells, her clashes with Peggy (Barbara Windsor), Phil, and Grant (Ross Kemp) part of the final showdown between the Watts and Mitchells that, in the words of one presenter, \\"grips the nation\\". The story's climax, resulting in Chrissie's exit from Walford, was such a considerable moment for the show that BBC bosses took the highly unusual step of keeping the \\"manner of her departure\\" a \\"complete mystery even to the soap's [own] producers\\", with reports claiming that \\"no less than four separate storylines [are] to be filmed for her departure from EastEnders\\". Commenting at the time to NOW, Oberman said, \\"I think Chrissie deserves to get away with murder. She was heavily provoked. I'd love to see her make it to Argentina... [and] run a beach bar with a young Latin lover by her side.\\" The immense public focus on the figure of Chrissie was used by executives in the intensifying ratings war, with the BBC \\"using the Chrissie Watts departure as the major weapon in our armoury... to snatch back viewers\\" from rival soaps. =Victim or villain?= To mark Chrissie's departure from the show, BBC Three aired a special episode of EastEnders Revealed on 22 September 2005. Entitled \\"Chrissie Watts: Victim or Villain?\\" the episode featured comments from Oberman, Grantham (Den), Dean (Sharon), Medcalf (Sam), Beckett (Jake), and Windsor (Peggy) profiling Chrissie and exploring the nuanced nature of the character. \\"A lot of viewers, and myself,\\" Oberman later remarked, \\"really wanted Chrissie to get away with it, especially as Den was such a monster. But soap and film noir have a lot in common – the bad girls have to be punished.\\" However, critics considered Chrissie to be a \\"three- dimensional soap bitch\\", rather than a flat pantomime figure. Despite having killed her father, Chrissie highly valued her friendship with Sharon, declaring at one point: \\"my friendship with you is the only good thing to come out of my relationship with Den, and I mean that!\\" Oberman characterised Chrissie as \\"part victim part villain\\", declaring \\"I think of her as a villain with a heart\\". She felt that, although \\"no excuse\\" for murder, Chrissie was driven to what she did: \\"She's not a cold blooded murderer, it was all done in a fit of pique\\", and that \\"these characters are made, not born.\\" Chrissie was haunted by the alcoholic fate of Den's first wife, which she vowed at Angie's grave to avoid. But in spite of her efforts, and indeed because of them, she failed, as she came to recognise: \\"You know it's funny; when Den used to talk about Ange he used to describe her as this weak sad, cow. And I used to think 'not like me, oh no, not like me'. Who's having the last laugh now, Ange?\\" Reception As the wife of Den Watts, one of British soap's biggest figures, Chrissie was a high-profile character, with the turns in her storylines regularly splashed across the tabloid papers, becoming, in the words of reporter Katherine Hassell, \\"a national TV heroine after she arrived in Albert Square in 2004 as the wife of the resurrected Dirty Den\\". The character's tough and steely persona was widely cited by TV critics, such as Imogen Ridgway of The Evening Standard, who felt Chrissie to be the \\"dominant female character\\" in the show, maintaining an increasingly threatened EastEnders tradition of the independent, forceful female figure: \\"For a soap originally underpinned by dominant female characters, it seems odd that Chrissie Watts is apparently the only strong woman left in Walford\\". Oberman won praise for her \\"three-dimensional portrayal of a classic soap bitch\\", with Chrissie hailed as \\"helping revive the show's fortunes that had been lagging somewhat in recent years\\". According to the Daily Mirror reporter Elizabeth Hassell, the character became a \\"national TV heroine\\" to viewers shortly after arriving, for standing up to the antics of her dastardly husband, and is most often cited as a \\"strong\\" and \\"clever\\" woman, as well as being \\"hard as nails\\" in \\"the grand tradition of landladies of The Queen Vic\\". Although generally well received by viewers, the character was derided by Jim Shelley of the Daily Mirror. Other critics have variously called Chrissie a \\"witch\\", \\"venomous\\", and the show's resident \\"black widow\\". The storyline involving Den's death was among the most prominent of the decade, and generated intense media and public interest. Looking back on the period, Oberman noted the remarkable nature of the story: The special 1-hour 20th anniversary episode where Chrissie killed Den was watched by 14.34 million people on the night it was broadcast, attracting \\"almost 60% of possible viewers\\",The episode has since only been bested by a single showing of Coronation Street and the 2007 EastEnders Christmas special (though all BBC1 programs drew anomalously high viewers that day). See with a peak share of 57.8%. It was the highest rated episode of EastEnders that year, and has since only been bested by a showing on Christmas Day 2007 (which drew anomalous large audiences for all BBC One programmes that year), and the 25th anniversary episode.However, the 20th anniversary episode had a higher average share of viewers than any broadcast since 2003. See further However final figures for the broadcast, which factored in digital and recorded viewings, rose to over 17 million making it the highest rated screening of a British soap since 2003. The episode received a massive amount of media interest, and was highly praised for displaying \\"some of the tightest, funniest dialogue this soap has seen\\". Oberman revealed that she could not stop laughing during filming of the scenes, as Grantham's hair was stuck to the floor: \\"We did lots of takes and poor Leslie was on his back for hours with fake blood all around his head. The liquid dried and his hair was glued to the floor. When he got up it ripped his hair out!\\" The aftermath dominated EastEnders in 2005 and helped to revive the fortunes of the show. According to the former head of BBC Drama Serials, Mal Young, this was dependent on the character of Chrissie, who was responsible for \\"anchoring the success of the anniversary storyline\\". A similar sentiment was expressed by Ian Hyland in the Sunday Mirror, who although critical of the convuluted plot felt EastEnders was improving \\"mainly because Chrissie is doing her best to rescue the fallout from the storyline dirty bomb Den's murder has become\\", and described the character as performing a \\"rescue act\\" on the show. However, Jim Shelley of the Daily Mirror was highly critical of Chrissie, calling her \\"the ludicrous Lady MacBeth wannabe\\", and felt her departure was ennabling EastEnders to move forward. In contrast, the TV editor of The Daily Telegraph Telegraph hailed Chrissie as \\"helping revive the show's fortunes that had been lagging somewhat in recent years\\". Oberman has described her time on the show as \\"hectic\\". During Chrissie's tenure there was constant shuffling behind the scenes, with three different executive producers taking the reins, with each new producer bringing in new writing teams. Uncertainty came to be manifested in writing and scripts, with character inconsistencies and plot holes working their way into production. One notable example was ownership of The Queen Victoria, with Chrissie legally owner of half the pub after Den legitimately signed over the deed before they renewed their vows in February. However, in November this fact was forgotten, with Chrissie represented as forging Den's signature to nullify her ownership of the pub which legally became Sharon's. Problems with the script did not escape Oberman, who criticised her character's storylines after she left the show, saying the writers \\"must have been on crack\\", adding how \\"plots didn't make logical or emotional sense – but they said, 'That's the soap convention, dear, get used to it'\\". She also considered some scenes to be irresponsible, saying \\"I was worried when four- year-olds said to me, 'I saw you kill Den.' I don't agree with censorship but there has to be a level of responsibility.\\" One of the consequences of all the uncertainty behind the scenes was Chrissie's final fate, which was left largely unresolved. Oberman revealed in July 2009 that there were originally plans for a trial, but that poor timing ultimately shelved the storyline. She recalled how the storyline \\"was put on hold and then there was a whole different team involved after that. I know that if they couldn't get me, Michelle and Kim together, [they wouldn't do it]. And I'd moved straight on to Doctor Who, too. Nobody was available until the following year, by which point Michelle was in Bionic Woman, I was pregnant and Kim was in Cabaret.\\" Because of this \\"I never felt it was finished off and I would have loved to have wrapped it up.\\" She went on to declare her desire to return for a proper resolution. \\"I'd love to finish off Chrissie's storyline because I love the character and I do feel that she was left in limbo. To know what happened to her would be great. Even if she went back to say goodbye or wanted to make peace with Sam. Or maybe we could see her in prison?\\" In a 2009 interview, Oberman commented on the significance of the character to EastEnders and viewers, saying \\"I can't believe that I'm still recognised so much as Chrissie. I still get a lot of letters about her, too. I think that she had as much of an impact as Janine (Charlie Brooks) did, which surprised me. Chrissie wasn't around for that long but she was an amazing character with an epic storyline.\\" Oberman was nominated for a number of awards for her portrayal of Chrissie Watts. In 2004, she was nominated for Most Popular Newcomer at the National Television Awards; she also received four nominations at the British Soap Awards, for Best Newcomer in 2004, Villain of the Year in 2005 and 2006, and Soap Bitch of the Year in 2006. In 2005, she was nominated for Best Actress and Best Bitch at the Inside Soap Awards.

I-190 runs west from I-90 to O'Hare International Airport, for a distance of . Interstate 190 is the westernmost leg of the Kennedy Expressway.  Route description  Interstate 190 has two lanes in either direction between Interstate 90 and Interstate 294, and three lanes west of I-294. The freeway portion of I-190 consists largely of cloverleaf interchanges. The Blue Line operates in the median of I-190 for the highway's entire length. Each road crossing I-190 is accessible via exit ramps. Not all interchanges are accessible in the same way from both directions, however. For example, the exit to southbound U.S. 12/45 traveling eastbound on I-190 requires exiting at Bessie Coleman Drive. Westbound, direct access is provided. There is no specific sign indicating Interstate 190's western terminus at O'Hare. Interstate-standard freeway ends roughly at the ramps to the upper (departure) and lower (arrival) loops. The freeway then resumes shortly after both loops merge to cross an emergency fire lane. The eastern terminus, I-90, is considered to be the origin point of the highway. Both exit numbers and mileage markers on roadside light fixtures ascend traveling westbound.  History  The highway that is now I-190 was signed as part of Illinois Route 194 from 1960 to 1970. In 1971, it was changed to Illinois Route 594. Then, it was changed to I-190 around 1978 after the rest of Illinois 194 was changed to Interstate 90 in the mid to late 1970s.Carlson, Rich. Illinois Highways Page: Routes 181 thru 200. Last updated April 15, 2005. Retrieved June 27, 2006. In late 2005, the intersection with Mannheim Road was reconstructed to remove unsafe conditions and bring the route closer to Interstate standards. In the late 1990s, the Illinois Department of Transportation restriped I-190 at Interstate 294. This action increased the number of lanes west of I-294 from two to three. In the process, the speed limit was reduced from 45 to 35, and yield signs were erected at the ends of the ramp from northbound Mannheim Road to westbound I-190, the busiest ramp at that intersection. This created a hazardous condition, often leading to high-speed crashes should drivers waiting on the ramp become impatient or underestimate the speed of westbound traffic. Often, an IDOT Minuteman (rapid response vehicle) would be stationed on the ramp waiting to tow away vehicles that were involved in crashes during rush hour.  Exit list  Although exit numbers on I-190 increase from east to west, this table presents interchanges from west to east to follow IDOT milepost measurements starting at O'Hare International Airport.

The freeway bisects downtown Buffalo before crossing Grand Island and travelling around the outskirts of Niagara Falls before crossing the Niagara River on the Queenston-Lewiston Bridge into Ontario. On the Canada side of the Canada–US border, the freeway continues as Highway 405, a short spur that connects with the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW), which in turn provides a freeway connection to Toronto, Canada's largest city. The route also provides access to the QEW at the Peace Bridge between Buffalo and Fort Erie, Ontario. Officially, I-190 from I-90 north to New York State Route 384 (NY 384) is named the Niagara Thruway and is part of the New York State Thruway system. The remainder, from NY 384 to Lewiston, is known as the Niagara Expressway and is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation. I-190 is the only three-digit Interstate Highway to reach the Canada–US border, and one of only two to connect to an international border, the other being Interstate 110 in Texas. Parts of the highway were built along the former rights-of-way of the Lehigh Valley Railroad and the Erie Canal. The entire route was built as part of the New York State Thruway in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and was completed in 1964. The cost of I-190's construction had been paid off by 1996, and by law, the tolls along the freeway were supposed to be removed at that point; however, this did not occur until 2006. The Grand Island tollbooths remained in place for 12 more years, but were taken down in 2018 and replaced with high speed toll collection. Route description I-190 approaching exit 11 in Buffalo I-190 begins at an interchange with the New York State Thruway (I-90) in Cheektowaga in Erie County, just north of the West Seneca town line and east of the Buffalo city line. I-190 heads west into Buffalo, passing the former location of the City Line toll barrier ahead of an interchange with South Ogden Street (exit 1). Farther west, I-190 meets NY 354 (exit 2), NY 16 (exit 3), and several local streets before entering downtown Buffalo. Within the downtown area, I-190 passes between KeyBank Center and Sahlen Field near an interchange with NY 5 (exit 7) on the shores of Lake Erie. At NY 5, I-190 turns northward to follow the path of the Niagara River. Shortly after meeting NY 266 (exit 8) immediately northwest of downtown, I-190 interchanges with Porter Avenue (exit 9), a local roadway connecting I-190 to the Peace Bridge and, thus, the Queen Elizabeth Way in Canada. North of downtown Buffalo, I-190 follows the eastern edge of the Black Rock Canal (and passes the site of the former Black Rock toll barrier) before rejoining the banks of the Niagara near an exit with the Scajaquada Expressway (NY 198, exit 11). I-190 continues north through the northern extents of Buffalo, meeting multiple streets before separating from the Niagara and interchanging with NY 266 and NY 324 (exits 15 and 16) in quick succession. At exit 16, NY 324 joins I-190 northward through western Tonawanda. The two routes then meet I-290 and NY 266 a second time prior to crossing the Niagara River on the South Grand Island Bridge. NY 324 leaves the expressway shortly after arriving on Grand Island at exit 18. Helvetica signage for exit 18A on I-190 I-190 and NY 324 follow parallel routings across Grand Island, with both roads passing on opposite sides of Fantasy Island, a local amusement park, near the center of the island. At the northern edge of the island, NY 324, as signed, terminates at exit 20; however, officially, NY 324 rejoins I-190 across the Niagara River once again via the North Grand Island Bridge. Now in Niagara Falls, Niagara County, NY 324 ends at a complex interchange featuring NY 384, the Niagara Scenic Parkway, and the LaSalle Expressway on the eastern bank of the river. Farther north, I-190 meets U.S. Route 62 (US 62) at exit 22 and NY 182 at exit 23. Past NY 182, I-190 turns to the northwest, skirting the northeastern edge of Niagara Falls and roughly paralleling NY 265 to the east. In Lewiston, the expressway meets NY 31 at exit 24 southwest of the large Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant reservoir. I-190 continues onward, crossing the canal between the reservoir and the power plant on a small dam also used by NY 265\\\\. The freeway then interchanges with NY 265, the Niagara Scenic Parkway, and NY 104 at the expansive exit 25 before curving to the west and terminating at the approach to the Lewiston–Queenston Bridge. Across the bridge in Queenston, Ontario, the roadway becomes Highway 405. History The portion of modern I-190 south of NY 384 in Niagara Falls was originally built by the New York State Thruway Authority as part of the New York State Thruway system. Construction on two segments of the highway—from South Ogden Street to Porter Avenue in downtown Buffalo and from Beaver Island Parkway to West River Road on Grand Island—began in 1953. On Grand Island, construction began to connect the two existing two lane bridges on July 16, 1954. By 1955, construction had begun on the remainder of the Niagara Thruway. On July 30, 1959, the Thruway was opened from the Tri-Level Interchange at I-90 to Porter Avenue, and from Sheridan Drive to the southern Grand Island bridge. The remainder of the highway, with the exception of the twinned Grand Island bridges, was completed by 1964. On August 14, 1957, the routing of what is now I-190 (including the then-partially complete Niagara Thruway) was originally designated as I-90N, as intercity routes were assigned before three-digit Interstate numbers were applied to the shorter intracity routes. I-90N was renumbered to I-190 on February 24, 1959. Construction on the portion of I-190 north of NY 384 began and was completed by 1964. In 1991, maintenance of I-84 in downstate New York was transferred from the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) to the New York State Thruway Authority (NYSTA). The monies for that purpose came from tolls levied on I-190 in downtown Buffalo. Under the laws authorizing the Thruway construction, the tolls were to be removed once the original bonds used to pay for the construction were paid off, which occurred in 1996; however, the tolls would remain for ten more years. Attorney Carl Paladino brought a lawsuit against the state in 2006 to force the removal of the tolls. On October 30, 2006, the Thruway Authority voted to both begin the process of returning maintenance of I-84 to NYSDOT and to remove the tolls on I-190 in Buffalo. Collection of the tolls stopped that day. Both major candidates in the 2006 New York gubernatorial election, Democrat Eliot Spitzer and Republican John Faso, had pledged to remove the tolls on I-190 if elected. While the toll barriers in Buffalo have since been demolished, the tolls further north on the two Grand Island bridges still remain.

Spanning approximately , it is signed as an east-west spur route of I-90 (the Massachusetts Turnpike) in Central Massachusetts. The route begins in Auburn at I-90 as a northward continuation of I-395. It follows L-shaped route, the nominally western half of the route runs north into the city of Worcester, and upon leaving the city, turns to the east to its eastern terminus at I-495 in Marlborough. Past I-495, the road continues as an unnumbered 1-mile connector to the town of Hudson. Route description Exit numbers on I-290 are a continuation of I-395 exit numbers. I-290 begins as the continuation of I-395 in Auburn with exits to I-90, Route 12, and the Auburn Mall. 290 continues north through Worcester into Downtown, where Route 146 and I-190 split off. After 146, I-290 has exits for Route 122A, Route 122, downtown, and Route 9. After 190, 290 presumes east to a junction with Route 70, then continues over Quinsigamond Lake into Shrewsbury, where it goes northeast. 290 has a junction with Route 140 and starts east into Boylston and Northborough, where it travels northeast again. 290 enters Marlborough with an exit for Solomon Pond Mall and has its final junction with 495, where it terminates shortly after on the Route 85 Connector. History Originally, I-290 was to rejoin I-90 in Westborough, roughly where I-495 sits now. However, this route would have run through the town centers of Shrewsbury and Northborough. Additionally, I-290 was intended to be extended past I-495 to I-95/Route 128 in Waltham, but this was canceled under pressure from towns along the planned route. A brief two-lane connector heads to Route 85 as a result of this aborted plan. The interchange with I-495 was originally supposed to be a cloverleaf, but after the plan was canceled, it was modified with a flyover ramp onto 495-northbound. In 2004, the former exit 12 (Route 146 south) was closed when the Route 146 freeway was under construction between the Mass Pike and I-290. It was completed in 2007. The current exit 12 replaces the former one. FutureMilepost-based exit numbering= While Massachusetts has used sequential exit numbers since 1964, the 2009 edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices required that all U.S. states submit plans to transition to milepost-based exit numbering by 2012. All interchanges were to be renumbered to milepost-based numbers under a project scheduled to start in 2016. However, this project was indefinitely postponed until November 18, 2019, when MassDOT confirmed that the exit renumbering project will begin, and \\"dual\\" mile markers with I-395 mileage will be installed, in late summer 2020. The department stated that it would consider re-designating I-290 as an extension of I-395 if the exit numbering project and dual mile markers are well-received by motorists. Exit list MassDOT is scheduled to replace sequential exit numbers with milepost-based exit numbers beginning in summer 2020.

It provides a route to Niagara Falls and Canada from the east that bypasses the city of Buffalo. I-290 also connects to I-990, and through this connection, provides access to the Amherst Campus of the University at Buffalo. Its official name is the Youngmann Memorial Highway, but locally, it is colloquially referred to as \\"the 290\\" and \\"the Youngmann\\". The highway provides the fastest road link between Toronto (Canada's largest city) and the heavily-populated Northeastern United States via I-90. Route description I-290 eastbound approaching exit 3B in Amherst I-290 begins at a semi-directional T interchange with I-190 within view of the Niagara River in an industrial sector of the Buffalo suburb of Tonawanda. The freeway heads east from I-190 into more residential areas of Tonawanda, where it meets New York State Route 384 (NY 384) at a three-quarter cloverleaf interchange. The two missing portions of the cloverleaf, both ramps leading to NY 384 from I-290 eastbound, are replaced by an exit to Elmwood Avenue located slightly west of the NY 384 exit. To the east of NY 384 (and adjacent to the southeasternmost point in the city of Tonawanda), I-290 interchanges with the Twin Cities Memorial Highway (NY 425). The Youngmann continues east through Tonawanda to the Amherst town line, where it meets U.S. Route 62 (US 62) at a second three-quarter cloverleaf interchange. Unlike the interchange with NY 384, all connections are possible between I-290 and US 62 due to a modified ramp linking I-290 westbound to US 62\\\\. Past US 62 in Amherst, I-290 turns to the southeast ahead of a semi-directional T interchange with I-990, a spur to Lockport. Farther east, I-290 meets NY 263 (Millersport Highway) at a cloverleaf interchange and NY 324 and NY 240 at a modified diamond interchange south of the University at Buffalo's North Campus in Amherst. I-290 westbound near I-990 Near Williamsville, I-290 turns southward and intersects NY 5 (Main Street) at a modified cloverleaf interchange. I-290 terminates at a semi- directional T interchange with the New York State Thruway (I-90) a half-mile to the south on the Amherst-Cheektowaga town line. This interchange is colloquially referenced as \\"The Blue Water Tower\\" due to its proximity to a large blue water tower on the Amherst-Cheektowaga town line. History What is now I-290 was originally intended to be designated I-190. The route was renumbered I-290 in 1958 to better reflect the future highway's routing as a connector between two Interstate Highways (or a bypass of Buffalo) rather than a spur. Construction on the expressway began when work commenced on the section between NY 263 and the New York State Thruway. This section was finished by the following year, by which time work had begun on the remainder of the freeway. The section between NY 263 and US 62 was opened to traffic while the rest was finished in the mid-1960s. The interchange with what is now I-990 was built in 1983.National Bridge Inventory, a database compiled by the United States Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration, available at www.nationalbridges.com. Accessed October 30, 2007. The expressway was originally named the Power Line Expressway for the high tension power lines that parallel the expressway. It was renamed in the early 1960s to serve as a memorial to Elmer G. H. Youngmann, a project engineer who died while the road was being built. The official name of the freeway became the Youngmann Memorial Highway; however, the name Youngmann Expressway has also been frequently used over the years.

He first appeared in the episode broadcast in the United Kingdom on 3 July 2003 and, following the murder of his gangland boss Jack Dalton (Hywel Bennett), became the show's main antagonist up until the character was axed and killed off in the series' 20th Anniversary episode, shown on 18 February 2005. The character's story arc began with Andy taking over Dalton's position as the leader of his criminal organization, The Firm, and becoming the newly established crime kingpin of Walford in the borough's local community — Albert Square. Soon afterwards, Andy went on to develop a mutual friendship with Dalton's employee-turned-killer Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman); establish a relationship with local wayward Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace), which led to the pair having a wedding that ended with Kat jilting Andy in favor of his love rival Alfie Moon (Shane Richie); repetitively clash with Dennis' girlfriend and Kat's daughter Zoe (Michelle Ryan) after he blackmails her mother into sleeping with him to get revenge on Alfie; humiliate Dennis' illegitimate father Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) after defeating him in a high-stakes poker game and then exposing his antics to his adopted daughter Sharon (Letitia Dean); feign a romance and subsequent marriage with Kat's best-friend Sam Mitchell (Kim Medcalf) in order to extract control of her family empire; instigate a feud with Sam's cousin Billy (Perry Fenwick) after the latter attempts to warn Sam's mother, Peggy (Barbara Windsor), about his scheme to exploit her financial interests; arrange for Billy's companion Minty Peterson (Cliff Parisi) to get beaten up over his romantic feelings for Sam: build an unlikely friendship with his secretary Pat Evans (Pam St Clement); organize the death of employee Paul Trueman (Gary Beadle) in retribution for attempting to entrap Andy into a police sting operation over his criminal activities; spark a conflict with Paul's adopted father, Patrick (Rudolph Walker), after the latter discovers the truth about his son's fate; and became enemies with Alfie's two cousins, Jake (Joel Beckett) and Danny (Jake Maskall), after having their grandmother Nana (Hilda Braid) attacked in retaliation for the pair stealing his car and later assaulting him. Eventually, Andy's criminal reign reached its conclusion towards the show's 20th anniversary episode — when Jake and Danny's mob boss, Johnny Allen (Billy Murray), arrived on the square and proceeded to usurp his position as both the square's reigning top dog and Walford's undisputed crime kingpin. In response to this, Andy planned to con £750,000 from Johnny during a criminal transaction between them. However, his plan failed when Andy was betrayed by his henchman Eddie (Daren Elliott Holmes) — who alerted Johnny of his plans to get one over him. This ultimately led to Johnny killing Andy by throwing him off a motorway bridge, thus ending the character's duration on the programme. Storylines Andy Hunter first appeared in July 2003 as the representative of Jack Dalton (Hywel Bennett), the reigning gangland kingpin of Walford — a fictionalized borough in East London — and leader of the city's criminal organization: The Firm. He meets up with his close friend Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman) in Walford's community area, Albert Square, to discuss the latter's intent on getting £20,000 from Dalton; recently, Dennis had been released from prison after serving his sentence for covering-up Dalton's criminal activities. After rewarding Dennis with his £20,000, Dalton plans to have him killed and has Andy summon Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) — the square's local hardman — to his office so he can carry out the task. Phil initially complies, but changes his mind when Dennis offers to kill Dalton himself so that the pair would be free from their gangland tormentor. This ultimately leads to Dennis killing Dalton, despite the latter's warnings that both Andy and the police will investigate him. However, it was at that point where is transpired that Dalton has previously ordered the murder of Dennis' father Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) in February 1989. The next day, Dalton's murder becomes public knowledge and Andy takes control of The Firm. He soon questions both Dennis and Phil about their alleged involvement in Dalton's death, up to the point where he has the mob keep them under surveillance — to which Phil wrongfully assumes is the police led by his arch-rival DCI Jill Marsden (Sophie Stanton). Later on, Andy confronts Phil just as he is about to go on a holiday with his fiancée Kate Morton (Jill Halfpenny) and daughter Louise (Rachel Cox). He explains to Phil that it was the mob and not the police that were keeping him and Dennis under surveillance. When Phil refuses to tell Andy the truth behind the events of Dalton's murder, Andy tricks Phil into exposing Dennis' role by offering him a sweet — to which Andy would take Phil's acceptance as confirmation that Dennis was the one who killed Dalton. This works successfully as Phil takes the sweet before leaving, and Andy later confronts Dennis with the knowledge that he murdered Dalton. Just as it appears that Andy is going to have Dennis killed, however, he instead pardons him and the two proceed to form a mutual friendship from there onwards; though Andy would later trigger Dennis' feud with Phil after he tells Dennis that Phil grassed him to the mob over Dalton's murder. Two months later, Den unexpectedly reappears in Walford after being presumed dead for the past fourteen years. This prompts Andy to order his goons to bring Den to him for a meet-up at the rendezvous point, where Andy decides to condone Den for his previous crimes against The Firm. Soon afterwards, Andy begins to personally settle himself in the square upon not being around there for most of his occasions. He quickly sparks a relationship with local wayward, Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace), even though she originally turned him down for a date in The Queen Victoria public house. Nevertheless, the pair end up getting engaged after Andy proposes to Kat during their trip to New York City — with Andy hoping to improve from his previous marriage to a woman named Ben years ago. On their wedding day, however, Kat's crush Alfie Moon (Shane Richie) runs into the church and says he loves her; Kat initially pronounces her love for Andy, but ultimately leaves him for Alfie — thus making Alfie and Andy enemies. When Alfie later gets himself involved with debt problems, Kat visits Andy and asks for a £10,000 loan. Andy reluctantly agrees, but later finds out that the couple have been unable to fully repay him on the deadline day. He promptly uses the opportunity to exact revenge on Alfie, but instead blackmails Kat into sleeping with him rather than have Alfie beaten up. Kat initially refuses, but relents when Andy says this will pay off her debts and also threatens to have Alfie killed if she does not relent to his demand. The two later go to bed together, which is secretly filmed by Andy as he had set-up a hidden video camera to record everything — as part of his plan to get revenge on Alfie for ruining his wedding to Kat. His plan comes to fruition even at the point where Alfie manages to provide the £10,000 to repay his debt to Andy, but only after Kat had already slept with Andy earlier on. Andy later gives the tape to Alfie, who then watches the events out of curiosity and is heartbroken at what he sees. Alfie later confronts Kat about this and their marriage is nearly destroyed as Andy had hoped to achieve. However, this is unsuccessful as Alfie forgives Kat for her betrayal and they later plot to get payback on Andy. This emerges when Alfie delivers a tape to Andy, who reckons that it is the same tape that Andy had sent to him. However, as Andy starts to watch it, he is taken aback as he discovers it is a different tape of Alfie and Kat's wedding. Andy eventually comes to accept Kat's decision of choosing Alfie over him and allows the couple to proceed with their marriage, but continues to clash with Alfie as their rivalry continues to escalate. By then, Andy has established himself as the square's newly reigning top dog — a trait which formerly belonged to Phil, until he was forced on the run after Den and Dennis set him up for armed robbery during the Mitchell and Watts' family feud. Andy also cements his position as Walford's undisputed crime kingpin, in the midst of expanding his criminal empire, up to the point where he summons his henchman Eddie (Daren Elliott Holmes) to help maintain his status. Andy later tries to hire Dennis into the business, but this does not last long when Dennis resolves to helping Den co-manage his nightclub: \\"Angie's Den\\". As time goes on, Kat's daughter Zoe (Michelle Ryan) begins dating Dennis, and soon finds out about how Andy blackmailed her mother into sleeping with him. Zoe promptly confronts Andy, and ends up hurting her lip following a scuffle between them. Zoe later makes it appear to Dennis that Andy had assaulted her, which causes him to look for him around the square until he spots Andy going to the local bookies. There, Dennis confronts and punches Andy — who is forced to explain what he did to Kat in order to get Dennis to understand the truth about Zoe. A few days later, Den invites Andy to a poker game and the pair go all-in with all their money and assets; Andy wins the final round, but chooses not to take Den's possessions and instead urges him to sort his life out. Den later tries to get revenge on Andy by committing a scam at his bookies, but this fails when Andy discovers his plan, after being informed about this by Den's longtime friend Pat Evans (Pam St Clement) — with whom Andy has developed an unlikely bond, on this occasion. Andy later confronts Den about his scam, and humiliates him in the pub by revealing his gambling bet to his adopted daughter Sharon (Letitia Dean), before comforting Pat after Den refuses to apologize for disrespecting her character in front of everyone in the pub; Andy later hires Pat to become his secretary at the bookies. Andy soon begins a newfound romance with Phil's younger sister Sam (Kim Medcalf), who has recently taken control of the Mitchell assets following the events of Phil's departure from the square; moreover, the two siblings' hard-man brother Grant (Ross Kemp) is also absent in Walford. It soon becomes clear that Andy is actually forging his relationship with Sam in order to extract control of all her family assets. This continues when Andy proposes to Sam and the pair end up getting married, despite the efforts of Sam's cousin Billy (Perry Fenwick) and his friend Minty Peterson (Cliff Parisi) to stop this by informing her mother Peggy (Barbara Windsor) about his scheme. However, Peggy supports Andy after he tricks her into believing that his intentions to be with Sam are purely for goodwill. When Andy learns that Minty has romantic feelings towards Sam and had nearly ruined their wedding as a result of this, he gets revenge on Minty by arranging for him to get beaten up; Andy later visits Minty in hospital and threatens him to stay away from Sam. But towards the verge of Christmas 2004, Sam discovers the truth about Andy just moments after she ends up losing her ownership of The Queen Vic to Den — who had conned the pub from Sam by blackmailing her lawyer, Marcus Christie (Stephen Churchett), into bankrupting the Mitchell family empire. Upon learning that her family business means nothing to his criminal reign anymore, Andy kicks Sam out of their house and leaves her penniless; she subsequently resides with Minty, after they make amends over what Andy did to them. In the midst of forging his relationship with Sam, and prior to ending their marriage, Andy decides to expand into drug trafficking and employs her next-door neighbour Paul Trueman (Gary Beadle) into the operation. Paul manages to establish Andy's empire with a succession of his favors. Later on, Andy is contacted by a mob boss called Mr. Corley and his hitman Carter (Michael McKell). They wish for Andy to do a drug trade with them, and he assigns Paul to manhandle the impending transaction. However, Paul ends up getting arrested, and he is forced to grass Andy to the police in order to avoid facing the risk of a prison sentence. Paul later tries to help the police entrap Andy in a sting operation, but Andy intercepts this at the last second and avoids meeting Mr. Corley at the rendezvous point. Returning to his office, Andy finds Carter waiting for him and is given his phone number, to find out who sabotaged their meet-up. Andy confronts Paul in the pub, and deduces his betrayal after noticing Paul's anxiety in being around him. In response, Andy alerts Carter about Paul's betrayal, and arranges for Paul to be escorted by taxi murdered that night. In January 2005, Andy's feud with Alfie is resurfaced when he instantly clashes with the latter's two cousins Jake (Joel Beckett) and Danny (Jake Maskall) following their arrival on the square — wherein Danny ends up stealing his car, and Jake mocks Andy in public. After ordering Eddie to investigate the pair, Andy learns that Jake and Danny are working for local crime boss Johnny Allen (Billy Murray) — who soon arrives on the square himself. Andy is initially satisfied when Johnny puts Jake and Danny in their place, but his mood changes when Johnny later visits him to request that he hire the duo to work for him at his bookmakers shop: \\"Turf Accountants\\". Andy reluctantly agrees, and becomes impressed when Jake and Danny start to work under his compliance, but this quickly grows too much for Danny - up to the point where Danny unexpectedly lashes out at Andy near a bus stop. Jake arrives in time to restrain Danny from their employer, but ends up punching Andy after he proceeds to insult Danny over his behaviour. This provokes Andy into getting revenge on Jake and Danny by arranging for their grandmother, Nana (Hilda Braid), to be mugged in their house and for his goons to steal her beloved ring. This escalates the conflict between Alfie's cousins and Andy himself, until Johnny learns about the situation and intervenes — authorizing Jake and Danny to resume their job while Andy is forced to return Nana's ring to Alfie. It is at this point where Johnny gradually begins to usurp Andy from his top dog status and criminal reign on the square, going as far as to buy \\"Angie's Den\\" just as Andy prepares to take control of it. Later on, Andy becomes unnerved when Paul's adopted father Patrick (Rudolph Walker) begins searching for him and constantly questions Andy about his whereabouts. Andy repeatedly denies any knowledge of Paul's fate, but Johnny soon becomes drawn into the subject after witnessing Patrick confront Andy once more. Johnny later orders for Paul to be retrieved, and Patrick subsequently learns of his son's fate when the police inform him that Paul has been found murdered. After identifying Paul's body to confirm that he is dead, Patrick instantly requests the police to question Andy — which they do. However, Andy is let off the hook after the police are unable to find evidence against him. Patrick later swears revenge against Andy after confronting him over Paul's death. When Pat quizzes Andy over Paul's murder, Andy confides to her about his involvement, and she ends their friendship as his paranoia grows — up to the point where Andy even threatens to kill Pat, should she tell the police. In February 2005, Johnny summons Andy and Jake at the bookmakers to request the two work together at carrying out a £750,000 transaction on his behalf — which Johnny claims will secure his retirement from the criminal underworld. Andy is adamant with Johnny's claims that he is retiring from his gangland lifestyle, and is further surprised when Johnny tells him that he will end up receiving just £5,000 of the £750,000 transaction cut — with Jake being granted £2,000. By then, Andy has grown outraged that Johnny is taking charge of his criminal reign. This is further evident when Johnny kicks Andy out of his office for disrupting his meeting with Jake, who was shown to be bleeding after Danny assaulted him — which Andy indirectly caused, by telling Danny that Jake aims to replace him as Johnny's favourite henchman. Later on that night, Andy spirals out of control when Johnny tells him that he will be doing the transaction on his own, after putting Jake out of the deal. Ignoring Eddie's concern over his behaviour, Andy begins to insult Sam and Den until the latter bars him from The Queen Vic — where Johnny and Jake help Den kick Andy and Eddie out of the pub. Shortly afterwards, Andy vows to get one over on Johnny, and hatches a plan to steal his £750,000 from the transaction deal; he later ropes Danny into helping with his scheme. On the night of the deal, Andy succeeds with the trade and betrays Danny by leaving him on the street. However, before betraying him, Andy continues to antagonize Alfie by arranging for the local market to be trashed — which leaves most of the neighborhood feeling traumatized. Shortly after 'helping' Johnny with the trade, Andy is confronted by Alfie and the pair fight over Kat — whom Andy declares his love for, as he blames Alfie for ruining his happiness with her. Danny attempts to help Alfie take on Andy but the pair end up arguing over Danny's interference, and their distraction allows Andy to flee with Eddie in his car. On their way out of Walford, Andy is surprised when Eddie pulls over — claiming that he needs to use the bathroom. While waiting for Eddie to come back, Andy is surprised when Jake enters the car and Johnny opens his door — telling him that they need to have a 'conversation'. As Jake keeps hold of the £750,000, Andy realizes too late that Eddie betrayed him, and is forced to 'settle' his differences with Johnny. They seemingly part ways when Johnny offers a handshake, which Andy accepts. However, their handshake ends unexpectedly when Johnny – after giving Andy 'one final tip' and saying to him 'Enjoy your flight!' – suddenly forces Andy off the flyover, causing Andy to fall to his death upon hitting the ground. Shortly afterwards, Johnny and Jake leave at the scene of Andy's death, whilst Eddie flees the country for good. Ironically, Andy dies on the same night that Den is bludgeoned to death by his wife Chrissie (Tracy Ann Oberman). While Den's murder remains a mystery to the square, Andy's death becomes public knowledge when the police are informed about his fate — which is depicted to be a suicide. Sam is asked to attend Andy's will reading, expecting to get all of his money and assets. However, Andy leaves the house to Pat and the bookmakers to Dennis, leaving Sam with just his wedding ring: 'so she can sell it, get her roots done and still be the dumbest blonde I ever knew'. In the only revenge she can exact on her late husband, Sam refuses to attend Andy's funeral — leaving Pat and Johnny to appear as the only guests to witness Andy being laid to rest. Following Andy's death, Johnny usurps his position as Walford's crime kingpin and ends up having Dennis killed at the end of the year; Dennis had learned on New Year's Eve 2005 that Johnny had not only throttled his pregnant wife Sharon, but also murdered Andy on the night Den died. Eventually, in March 2006, Johnny confesses his killings to the police, at the request of his daughter Ruby (Louisa Lytton) when she learns the truth about her father ordering Dennis to be murdered. Later, in October 2006, Andy's death is avenged by Ruby's boyfriend Sean Slater (Robert Kazinsky) when he causes Johnny to have a fatal heart attack, upon taunting him in a prison visit. Creation and developmentCasting and characterisation= Higgs auditioned for the role in April 2003 and won the part of EastEnders' new \\"bad guy\\", who made his first appearance in July that year as a member of the gangster organisation known as The Firm. Higgs stated that he was happy to play a villain: \\"They say that the devil has the best tunes, but the main thing is that the character's rounded. With the so-called good guys and bad guys, they're not just good or just bad. There's a dynamic, and that's always the interesting thing to find - where's the weakness? You flesh it out and make them an interesting person.\\" In the hierarchy of the Firm, Andy's character was a subordinate to Jack Dalton (Hywel Bennett), but was appointed leader of the organisation for a brief time following Dalton's murder. Higgs described the differences between Andy and Dalton's leadership styles: \\"He's new blood, but he has a completely different sensibility about how the gang operates. Jack Dalton was quite old school. If you upset him you'd get your knee-caps broken or get killed. I think Andy plays more of a psychological game - information is power for him.\\" Discussing Andy's relationship with Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace), Higgs said, \\"I think you do see a soft side of him with Kat. He's totally in love with her, which makes him very vulnerable. He's been married before, but the marriage didn't work out. You get the sense that there's some hurt there, some pain that's stopped him becoming involved with other women [...] he likes the spirit of her. She's no-nonsense, in-your-face and slightly larger than life. Andy likes that scared of no one approach. Kat reminds Andy of his mum, with her dark hair and feistiness. He likes the fact that she's a family girl - that's what he wants.\\" =Departure and death= On 18 November 2004 it was announced that actor Michael Higgs had been axed from his role as Andy Hunter and that his last scenes would be screened in Easter 2005. Higgs' axing from the role came following the decisions to axe fellow cast members Jill Halfpenny and Leslie Grantham. A BBC spokesperson stated, \\"We thank Michael for all his hard work.\\" It was speculated that the decision to have Higgs written out of the show was to make way for the introduction of Billy Murray as Johnny Allen, whom critics stated made Andy \\"look like small fry\\". In an interview on Today with Des and Mel in February 2005 Higgs hinted that his character would be killed off. He made his final appearance as Andy Hunter on 18 February 2005, when his character was murdered by Johnny. Leslie Grantham's final scenes as Den Watts were screened the same night as Andy's departure.

In 1865 Michel opened a school in Paris which became known for its modern and progressive methods. Michel corresponded with the prominent French romanticist Victor Hugo and began publishing poetry. She became involved in the radical politics of Paris and among her associates were Auguste Blanqui, Jules Vallès and Théophile Ferré. In 1869 the feminist group Société pour la Revendication du Droits Civils de la Femme (Society for the Demand of Civil Rights for Women) was announced by André Léo. Among the members of the group were Michel, Paule Minck, Eliska Vincent, Élie Reclus and his wife Noémie, Mme Jules Simon, Caroline de Barrau and Maria Deraismes. Because of the broad range of opinions, the group decided to focus on the subject of improving girls' education. Commonly known as the Revendication des Droits de la Femme (Demand for Women's Rights), the group had close ties with the Société Coopérative des Ouvriers et Ouvrières (Cooperative Society of Men and Women Workers). The July 1869 manifesto of the Revendication des Droits de la Femme was thus signed by the wives of militant cooperative members. The manifesto was also supported by Sophie Doctrinal, signing with Citroyenne Poirier, who would later become a close associate of Michel in the Paris Commune. In January 1870 Michel and Léo attended the funeral of Victor Noir. Michel expressed disappointment that the death of Noir had not been used to overthrow the Empire. At the start of the Siege of Paris, in November 1870, Léo in a lecture declared \\"It is not a question of our practicing politics, we are human, that is all. =Paris Commune= Michel in uniform. During the siege, Michel became part of the National Guard. When the Paris Commune was declared she was elected head of the Montmartre Women's Vigilance Committee. Michel thus occupied a leading role in the revolutionary government of the Paris Commune. In April 1871 she threw herself into the armed struggle against the French government. She closely aligned with Ferré and Raoul Rigault, two of the most violent members of the Paris Commune. However, Ferré and Rigault persuaded her to not carry out her plan to assassinate Adolphe Thiers, the chief executive of the French national government. Instead Michel fought with the 61st Battalion of Montmartre and organised ambulance stations. In her memoirs she later wrote \\"oh, I'm a savage all right, I like the smell of gunpowder, grapeshot flying through the air, but above all, I'm devoted to the Revolution.\\" Women played a key role in the Paris Commune. They not only chaired committees, but also built barricades and participated in the armed violence. Michel ideologically justified a militant revolution, proclaiming: \\"I descended the Butte, my rifle under my coat, shouting: Treason! . . . Our deaths would free Paris\\". Michel would be among the few militants who survived the Paris Commune and reflected: \\"It is true, perhaps, that women like rebellions. We are no better than men in respect to power, but power has not yet corrupted us.\\" In her memoirs Michel confessed that the realities of the revolutionary government strengthened her resolve to end the discrimination against women. On the attitude of her male comrades, she wrote \\"How many times, during the Commune, did I go, with a national guardsman or a soldier, to some place where they hardly expected to have to contend with a woman?\\". She challenged her comrades to \\"play a part in the struggle for women's rights, after men and women have won the rights of all humanity?\\" In December 1871, Michel was brought before the 6th council of war, charged with offences including trying to overthrow the government, encouraging citizens to arm themselves, and herself using weapons and wearing a military uniform. Defiantly, she dared the judges to sentence her to death, saying \\"It seems that every heart that beats for freedom has no other right than a bit of lead, so I claim mine!\\".Louis Dubreuilh. 1908. La Commune: 1871. Jules Rouff. p. 492 Michel was sentenced to penal transportation. It is estimated that 20,000 defenders of the Paris Commune had been summarily executed. Michel was among the 10,000 supporters of the Commune that were sentenced to deportation. =Deportation= The arrest of Louise Michel in May 1871 After twenty months in prison Michel was loaded onto the ship Virginie on 8 August 1873,Louise Michel, a French anarchist women who fought in the Paris commune to be deported to New Caledonia, where she arrived four months later. Whilst on board, she became acquainted with Henri Rochefort, a famous polemicist, who became her lifelong friend. She also met Nathalie Lemel, another figure active in the commune. It was this latter contact that led Louise to become an anarchist. She remained in New Caledonia for seven years and befriended the local Kanak people. Taking an interest in Kanak legends, cosmology and languages, particularly the bichelamar creole, she learned about Kanak culture from friendships she had made with Kanak people. She taught French to the Kanaks and took their side in the 1878 Kanak revolt. The following year, she received authorisation to become a teacher in Nouméa for the children of the deported — among them many Algerian Kabyles (\\"Kabyles du Pacifique\\") from Cheikh Mokrani's rebellion (1871). =Return to France= In 1880, amnesty was granted to those who had participated in the Paris Commune. Michel returned to Paris, her revolutionary passion undiminished. She gave a public address on 21 November 1880 and continued her revolutionary activity in Europe, attending the anarchist congress in London in 1881, where she led demonstrations and spoke to huge crowds. While in London, she also attended meetings at the Russell Square home of the Pankhursts where she made a particular impression on a young Sylvia Pankhurst. In France she successfully campaigned, together with Charles Malato and Victor Henri Rochefort, for an amnesty to be also granted to Algerian deportees in New Caledonia. In March 1883 Michel and Émile Pouget led a demonstration of unemployed workers. In a subsequent riot, 500 demonstrators led by Michel pillaged three bakeries and shouted \\"Bread, work, or lead\\". Reputedly, Michel led this demonstration with a black flag, which has since become a symbol of anarchism. This was also the first recorded use of the Anarchy black flag. Michel was tried for her actions in the riot and used the court to publicly defend her anarchist principles. She was sentenced to six years of solitary confinement for inciting the looting. Michel was defiant, for her the future of the human race was at stake, \\"one without exploiters and without exploited.\\" Michel was released in 1886, at the same time as Kropotkin and other prominent anarchists. =Exile and speaking tours= In 1890 she was arrested again. After an attempt to commit her to a mental asylum she moved to London. Michel lived in London for five years. She opened a school and moved among the European anarchist exile circles. Her International Anarchist School for the children of political refugees opened in 1890 on Fitzroy Square. The teachings were influenced by the libertarian educationist Paul Robin and put into practice Mikhail Bakunin's educational principles, emphasising scientific and rational methods. Michel's aim was to develop among the children the principles of humanity and justice. Among the teachers were exiled anarchists, such as Victorine Rouchy-Brocher, but also pioneering educationalists such as Rachel McMillan and Agnes Henry. In 1892 the school was closed, when explosives were found in the basement. See Walsall Anarchists. Michel contributed to many English speaking publications. Some of Michel's writings were translated into English by the poet Louisa Sarah Bevington. Michel's published works were also translated into Spanish by the anarchist Soledad Gustavo. The Spanish anarchist and workers rights activist Teresa Claramunt became known as the \\"Spanish Louise Michel\\". By that time Michel had become a well known speaker, touring Europe repeatedly to speak in front of thousands of people. In 1895 Sebastien Faure and Michel founded the French anarchist periodical Le Libertaire (The Libertarian), now called Le Monde Libertaire (Libertarian World). In the same year Michel met Emma Goldman at an anarchist conference in London, at which both were speaking. The young Goldman was hugely impressed by Michel, considering her to have a \\"social instinct developed to the extreme\\". In reference to the harsh conditions of Michel's life, Goldman asserted \\"Anarchists insist that conditions must be radically wrong if human instincts develop to such extremes at the expense of each other.\\" Michel returned to France in 1895, and was not active in the agitation provoked by the Dreyfus affair in 1898. In an 1896 article, entitled \\"Why I am an Anarchist\\", Michel argued that \\"Anarchy will not begin the eternal miseries anew. Humanity in its fight of despair will cling to it in order to emerge from the abyss.\\" In 1904 Michel went on a conference tour through French Algeria. Michel was scheduled to meet the anti-colonial campaigner Isabelle Eberhardt, but Eberhardt died shortly before Michel arrived in Algeria. Michel died of pneumonia in Marseille on 10 January 1905. Her funeral in Paris was attended by more than 100,000 people. Michel's grave is in the cemetery of Levallois-Perret, in one of the suburbs of Paris. The grave is maintained by the community. This cemetery is also the last resting place of her friend and fellow communard Théophile Ferré. Political theory \\"A new feature, in umbrellas\\", satirizing Michel's political views. Michel once joked, \\"We love to have agents provocateurs in the party, because they always propose the most revolutionary motions.\\" Michel's political ideas evolved throughout her life. Once a teacher with progressive ideals, her activism saw her embrace revolutionary socialism, but the experience of a failed revolution turned her into a radical anarchist. Her political theory progressed from peaceful reform to violent revolution, because she came to believe that contemporary society had to be completely destroyed for a new egalitarian era to emerge. The many years she spent in prison and in the French penal colony New Caledonia were central to her change of heart. Michel's political theory had its roots in the aftermath of the French Revolution, which was followed by a series of monarchies. Two prevailing theories emerged. There were those who believed that the Reign of Terror that followed the revolution was proof that democracy was flawed. The ruling elites of the post-revolutionary monarchies believed that for the economy to succeed, it was necessary to control the labour market, wages and working conditions. Thus few labour reforms were enacted. On the other hand, French romanticism reinterpreted the French Revolution as the tangible spirit of the French people. In the 1840s romanticism in France became politicised, because it became accepted that individual happiness could not be achieved in isolation. Romantics became preoccupied with social progress and reform. Writers embarked on a quest to realistically portray the lives of the working poor. Victor Hugo and Emile Zola emerged as key writers and political activists. Shortly after Michel was born in 1830 a short-lived revolt resulted in a constitutional monarchy being established. Louis Philippe I encouraged commercial interests and the enrichment of the upper-middle class through colonization and penal transportation, but at the same time practiced laissez-faire when the socio- economic plight of the working class was concerned. Michel first made a name for herself by publicly defending the poor and working-class women. In the 1860s she was noted as political activist for vehemently opposing the policies of Emperor Napoleon III. Napoleon III curtailed the civil and political rights of the French citizens and enacted a series of economic policies that disadvantaged waged labourers. Michel signed a number of her published political writings with Enjolras, the name of the revolutionary in Hugo's Les Misérables. In 1865 she provocatively wrote a new Marseillaise, the call to arms during the French Revolution. In her Marseillaise, Michel called for a mass uprising of the people to defend the republic, arguing that martyrdom was preferable to defeat. This sentiment would be echoed in her subsequently published poetry, plays and novels. But unlike her contemporaries, Michel repeatedly lamented the violent treatment of children and the gory abuse of animals. Michel's political characters fought for justice, while the children and animals in her fictional works were too weak, sick and starved to resist or survive. When Emperor Napoleon III and his army were captured by the Prussians in 1870, the French Third Republic was proclaimed in Paris. But the provisional government continued the war against the Prussians and a four- month siege of Paris resulted in bleak hardship. Parisians starved and froze to death. Some managed to save themselves by eating cats, dogs and rats. The government surrendered, but Michel and other Parisians had taken up arms and organised themselves as a National Guard. When the Paris Commune was proclaimed Michel was named head of the Women's Vigilance Committee and played a key role in initiating economic and social reforms. Michel pushed through the separation of church and state, initiated educational reforms and codified rights for workers. When the Paris Commune was crushed in May 1871 Michel witnessed unrelenting bloodshed and the summary execution of thousands. When Michel was tried, she demanded to be killed by firing squad and proclaimed \\"If you let me live, I shall never stop crying for vengeance, and I shall avenge my brothers by denouncing the murderers\\". The military court refused to make her a martyr. Michel was imprisoned for two years before she was deported. While in prison she demanded to be treated just like the other prisoners and rejected efforts by her friends Hugo and Georges Clemenceau to have her sentence commuted. She considered preferential treatment a dishonour. During the four-month journey to New Caledonia Michel re-examined her belief in revolutionary socialism. She embraced anarchism and for the rest of her life rejected all forms of government. In 1896 she wrote about her change of mind: > \\"I considered the things, events and people of the past. I thought about the > behaviour of our friends of the Commune: they were scrupulous, so afraid of > exceeding their authority, that they never threw their full energies into > anything but the loss of their own lives. I quickly came to the conclusion > that good men in power are incompetent, just as bad men are evil, and > therefore it is impossible for liberty ever to be associated with any form > of power whatsoever.\\" Michel was introduced to the tenets of anarchism by a fellow prisoner Nathalie Lemel, with whom she was imprisoned in a large cage for several months. Michel became known for her selfless generosity and devotion to others. In the penal colony she lived in voluntary poverty, giving away her books, clothes and any money she acquired. Michel took up teaching again. She spent time with the indigenous Canaques, teaching them French so that they could challenge the French authorities. Michel supported them in their revolt against the colonial power. An elderly Michel depicted as an animated speaker. Louise Michel at home in France during her later years. In 1875 the monarchist-dominated National Assembly passed a constitution that established a republican government with an upper and lower house of parliament. This democracy was a compromise, as the National Assembly could not agree on who should be king. The brutal crackdown on the Paris Commune would influence French politics for years to come. Conservatives and moderates in the new government avoided anything that could trigger another uprising. This fear delayed the amnesty for those who had participated in the Paris Commune for years. Eventually an amnesty was granted and when Michel returned to Paris in November 1880 she was greeted by Henri Rochefort, Clemenceau, a crowd of 20,000 and the police. But she had no patience for Clemenceau's \\"illustration... that he should wait for parliamentarianism to bring progress\\". Michel soon began her career as a public speaker and found an audience all over Europe. In 1882 she staged her first anarchist play Nadine. As a public speaker Michel became skilled in advancing pragmatic arguments to attack capitalism and the authoritarian state, while holding open the possibility of a positive outcome. When she was put on trial in 1883 for leading a group of unemployed workers, she attacked shortcomings in the implementation of the French republican constitution, saying: > \\"They keep talking to us about liberty: There is the liberty of speech with > five years of prison at the end. In England, the meeting would have taken > place; in France, they have not even made a legal admonition in order to let > the crowd retreat, which would have left without resistance. People are > dying from hunger, and they do not even have the right to say that they are > dying from hunger.\\" Michel frequently spoke on women's rights from an anarchist perspective. She not only advocated education for women, but also that marriage should be free and that men should hold no property rights over women. In the late 1880s she authored several works in which she revisited the themes of her earlier works, but also portrayed the demise of the old order and its replacement with a society of equals. Michel embarked on a journey towards a new political philosophy. The revolutionary characters in The Strike expected to die, but instead they gave life to a new age and Michel discussed the rights and responsibilities of the people who lived in the aftermath of a revolution. She staged her plays in accordance with Jean Grave's theory on audience participation. The audience was integrated through a political and artistic program of lectures, poems and songs. The audience was encouraged to react and re-enact the conflicts of the plays. In her plays The Human Microbes (1886), Crimes of the Times (1888) and The Bordello (1890) an agricultural utopia emerges from a devastated Europe. Michel's political ideals owed much to the French romanticism of Hugo and are described at length in The New Era, Last Thought, Memories of Caledonia (1887): > \\"It is indeed time that this old world die since no one is safe any > longer... We can no longer live like our Stone Age ancestors, nor as in the > past century, since the series of inventions, since the discoveries of > science have brought the certainty that all production will increase a > hundredfold when these innovations will be used for the general good, > instead of letting just a handful of vultures help themselves in order to > starve the rest.\\" Michel lived at a time when hunger was widespread among the working poor of Europe. She believed that technological progress would replace physical labour with machines. In combination with anarchist politics, she argued, this could lead to equal distribution of wealth. In 1890 she reasoned that \\"the attractive power of progress will demonstrate itself all the more as daily bread will be assured, and a few hours of work which will have become attractive and voluntary will be enough to produce more than what is necessary for consumption.\\" Like other anarchists of her time she did not believe that history was a record of constant improvement, but that it could become so. However, constant economic growth was not an improvement in itself. Michel argued instead, that progress came through intellectual development, social evolution and liberation. Her vision of the future was shaped by a supreme confidence. > \\"Science will bring forth harvests in the desert; the energy of the tempests > and whirlpools will carve paths through the mountains. Undersea boats will > discover lost continents. Electricity will carry ships of the air above the > icy poles. The ideas of Liberty, Equality and Justice will finally burst > into flame. Each individual will live his integral part within humankind as > a whole. Progress being infinite, transformations will be perpetual.\\" Michel did not only bemoan the poverty in which people across Europe lived, she also advanced a detailed critique of 19th century capitalism. She lamented the deficiencies of the capitalist banking system and predicted that the concentration of capital would result in the ruin of small enterprises and the middle class. In her memoirs Michael said that the Anarchist Manifesto of Lyon (1883) precisely expressed her views. The Manifesto had been signed by Peter Kropotkin, Émile Gautier, Joseph Bernard, and Toussaint Bordat. Kropotkin, like Jules Guesde and Émile Pouget would become close friends and associates of her. Instead of focusing on violent revolution, as she had done in her earlier works, Michel in her later works emphasised the spontaneous uprising of the people. She came to reject terror as a means of bringing about a new era. She wrote \\"Tyrannicide is practical only when tyranny has a single head, or at most a small number of heads. When it is a hydra, only the Revolution can kill it\\". She took the view that it is best if the leaders of such a revolution would perish, so that the people would not be burdened with surviving general staff. Michel thought that \\"power is evil\\" and in her mind history was the story of free people being enslaved. In an 1882 speech she said \\"All revolutions have been insufficient because they have been political\\". Organisation was, in her mind, not necessary because the poor and exploited would rise up and, through their sheer numbers, would force the old order to shrivel up. Legacy Michel's tomb at the Levallois-Perret cemetery Michel was among the more influential French political figures in the second half of the 19th century. She was also one of the more powerful women political theorists of her day. Her publications on social justice for the poor and the cause of the working classes were read in France and all over Europe. When she died in 1905 she was mourned by thousands. Memorial services were held all over France and in London. Although her writings are today forgotten, her name is remembered in the names of French streets, schools and parks. Michel became a national heroine in France and was revered as the \\"great citizen\\". A cultish image of Michel emerged. Shortly before her death, when returning from her exile in London, Michel had been dubbed \\"the angel of petrol\\", \\"the virago of the rabble\\" and \\"queen of the scum\\" by the conservative French press. In turn, Charles Ferdinand Gambon compared her to Jeanne d'Arc in reference to her role in the Paris Commune. This imagery was further propagandized by Edmond Lepelletier in 1911. The image of Michel as vierge rouge (red virgin) came to be used by conservative and liberal historians alike when recounting the story of the Paris Commune. Michel is regarded as a founder of anarcho-feminism. Despite the anti-authoritarian rhetoric, early anarchist thinkers maintained cultural orthodoxy when it came to the division of domestic labour and their personal relationships with women. The founder of French anarchism, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon was notorious for his sexist views. Michel, Teresa Claramunt, Lucy Parsons, Voltairine de Cleyre and Emma Goldman became prominent figures in the late 19th century pan- European and American anarchist movement. With the formation of the First International anarchist sections in various European countries under the leadership of Mikhail Bakunin, anarchism became noted for not only encouraging female participation in the political movement, but also for espousing the ideal of female emancipation. Michel was rediscovered by French feminists in the 1970s through the works of Xavière Gauthier. Academic interest in Michel's life and political writings was prompted in the 1970s by Édith Thomas's comprehensively researched biography. Louise Michel station on the Paris Metro, located in Levallois-Perret, is named for her. In 2020, street artist Banksy was credited for sending a rescue ship in the Mediterranean sea and naming it after Michel.

Collins Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopedia. (Foreword by The Rt Hon. The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs). Published in 1994. Pages 314 - 315. Historically the clan was based in the Scottish Borders. HistoryOrigins= The Latin word Scotti was originally used to describe the Celts of Ireland. However the historian George Fraser Black notes in his Surnames of Scotland that the earliest certain record of the name was that of Uchtred 'Filius Scott', in a charter from around 1120. In 1195 Henricus le Scotte witnessed a charter by David, Earl of Strathearn. At the beginning of the thirteenth century a Master Isaac Scotus witnessed charters by the Bishop of St Andrews. Michael Scott \\"The Wizard\\" (1175 – c.1232) was a real-life scholar and philosopher, whom Walter Scott described in The Lay of the Last Minstrel as \\"addicted to the abstruse studies of judicial astrology, alchemy, physiognomy, and chiromancy. Hence he passed among his contemporaries for a skilful magician\\".quoted in Four generations after Uchtred, Sir Richard Scott married the heiress of Murthockstone and in doing so acquired her estates. Sir Richard was appointed as the ranger of Ettrick Forest and this brought to him the additional lands of Rankilburn. The new laird built his residence at Buccleuch and the estates were generally known by this name. =Wars of Scottish Independence= Sir Richard's son, Sir Michael Scott the second Laird of Buccleuch was a staunch supporter of Robert the Bruce during the Wars of Scottish Independence. Michael distinguished himself at the Battle of Halidon Hill in 1333, being one of the few that escaped the carnage. However he was later killed at the Battle of Durham in 1346. Michael left two sons: Robert Scott, the third laird and John Scott who founded the important cadet branch of the clan, the Scotts of Synton from whom the Lords Polwarth descend. Robert Scott died in about 1389, probably from wounds received at the Battle of Otterburn. =15th and 16th centuries= Robert Scott, fifth of Buccleuch succeeded to the family estates in 1402 after his father, Walter, was killed in battle. In 1420 he acquired half of the lands of Branxholme, consolidating the family estates. He was active in supporting the Crown in the struggle to suppress the power of the Clan Douglas. When the king's cause prevailed Scott was rewarded with tracts of Douglas land. In 1463 Branxholme became a free barony on the annual payment of a red rose to the Crown on the feast day of St John the Baptist. The Scotts had become one of the most powerful of all the Border clans by the end of the fifteenth century and the chief could call upon a thousand spears to support him. Like most of the Border Reiver clans the Scotts quarrelled with their neighbours, in particular the Clan Kerr. The feud began on 25 July 1526 when Sir Walter Scott of Buccleuch launched an attack (the Battle of Melrose) to rescue the young James V of Scotland who was being held by the Douglas Earl of Angus at Darnick just west of Melrose, and in the ensuing fight Kerr of Cessford was killed. Sir Walter Scott was also wounded in the action. Scott later fought against the English at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh and four years later was appointed warden of Liddesdale and the Middle Marches. The Kerrs however were biding their time and in 1552 they set upon Sir Walter Scott on Edinburgh High Street and killed him. The feud came to an end when Sir Thomas Kerr of Ferniehirst married Janet Scott who was the sister of the tenth Laird of Buccleuch. In 1565 a deadly feud arose between the Clan Scott and their neighbours the Clan Eliott.Way, George and Squire, Romily. Collins Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopedia. (Foreword by The Rt Hon. The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs). Published in 1994. Pages 128 - 129. Scott of Buccleuch executed four Eliotts for the minor crime of cattle rustling. In response three hundred Eliotts rode to avenge the fate of their kinsmen and during the battle losses on both sides were heavy but eventually the two clans came to terms with each other. The tenth Laird of Buccleuch was a staunch supporter of Mary, Queen of Scots. His son, another Walter Scott went on to become a daring military leader who was known as \\"Bold Buccleuch\\". In 1596 he rescued his vassal, William Armstrong, who was known as \\"Kinmont Willy\\", from the Fortress of Carlisle which was previously thought to be impregnable. =17th century and civil war= James VI of Scotland's accession to the English throne was followed by a royal policy to pacify the Borders. Walter Scott, 1st Lord Scott of Buccleuch therefore sought adventure fighting on the Continent for the Prince of Orange in the Netherlands. His son was Walter Scott, 2nd Lord Scott of Buccleuch who commanded a regiment for the States of Holland against the Spanish. In 1619 he was advanced to the rank of Earl of Buccleuch. During the Scottish Civil War, Francis Scott, 2nd Earl of Buccleuch supported the National Covenant and opposed Charles I of England's religious policies. Scott led his cavalry against the royalist, James Graham, 1st Marquis of Montrose at the Battle of Philiphaugh. Francis Scott, 2nd Earl of Buccleuch died in 1651 and was succeeded by his four-year-old daughter, Mary Scott, 3rd Countess of Buccleuch. The General Assembly for the Church of Scotland allowed Mary to be married at the age of just eleven but she died aged just fourteen. She was succeeded by her sister, Ann Scott, who was considered one of the greatest heiresses in the kingdom. Charles II of England arranged for Anne Scott to marry his illegitimate son, James, Duke of Monmouth who as a result of the marriage assumed the surname Scott. On the day of their marriage the couple were created Duke and Duchess of Buccleuch. Monmouth later rose up in rebellion against the Crown and as a result he was executed in 1685 and his titles were forfeited. However, as Anne Scott had been specifically created Duchess of Buccleuch her titles were unaffected. She was succeeded by her grandson, Francis Scott, 2nd Duke of Buccleuch. =18th century and Jacobite risings= Scott tartan, as published in 1842 in Vestiarium Scoticum. Several Scotts fought for the government during the Jacobite rising of 1745. Captain John Scott commanded two companies of Royal Scots was defeated and taken prisoner at the Highbridge Skirmish in August 1745.Duffy, Christopher. (2007).

The Rafto Foundation for Human Rights was established in gratitude for his efforts and inspiration. Personal life Thorolf Rafto was born in Bergen, Norway. His father, Robert Rafto was an Olympic gymnast and the winner of the Norwegian decathlon championships in 1918. In his younger days Rafto competed on national level in athletics, and won the Norwegian championships in decathlon in 1947. During World War II, Thorolf Rafto fled to Britain and served with the Royal Norwegian Air Force. Back in Bergen after the war, he earned university degrees in Languages and History. In 1950, at the age of 28, Rafto married Helga Hatletvedt with whom, he had four children. In 1956, Thorolf Rafto became a lecturer at the Norwegian School of Economics in Bergen. Norwegian championships in decathlon Activism His involvement in political activism in Eastern Europe started with the Prague Spring of 1968. Later in his life, Rafto got, particularly, supportive of the liberal ideas of the Czechoslovak reformists such as Alexander Dubček and Jiří Hájek. In 1973, Rafto travelled to Odessa, where he witnessed the persecution of intellectuals and Soviet Jewish refuseniks, who had applied for emigration to Israel. On the return from the Soviet Union, Rafto wrote an article criticizing internal Soviet politics in Italy's Corriere della Sera, that later was published in Norway and Denmark. In 1979, Rafto traveled again to Prague to hold a lecture for students excluded from the universities for political reasons. He was abused and later imprisoned by the security police which may have caused him lasting health damage. In 1981, Rafto made several trips to Poland to work closer with labour organisations there. By 1985 his health was weakening. In 1986, Thorolf Rafto died at 64 years of age.  Rafto Foundation and Rafto Prize After the death of Thorolf Rafto, his friends and colleagues agreed to establish the Rafto Foundation for Human Rights (Raftostiftelsen) which would continue Rafto’s work on a promotion of freedom of speech and political expression in Eastern Europe. It was also decided to introduce the Thorolf Rafto Memorial Prize (Raftoprisen) for human right activists. The fall of the Iron Curtain and the consequential democratization of Eastern European states caused reconsider of the mission of the foundation. It also opened new possibilities to work with other geographical regions in a promotion of human rights. The initial idea of the Rafto Prize is to provide a basic informative platform for the laureates that would help to receive further attention from the international media and support from political and non-political organisations. By awarding the Rafto Prize, the Rafto Foundation for Human Rights seeks to bring attention to independent voices that due to oppressive and corrupt regimes are not always heard. In 1990, the Rafto Prize was awarded to a Burmese democratic leader, Aung San Suu Kyi who in the following year 1991 received the Nobel Peace Prize for her non-violent struggle for democracy and human rights. Four Rafto Laureates have subsequently received further international assistance and were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Aung San Suu Kyi, José Ramos-Horta, Kim Dae- jung and Shirin Ebadi were awarded the Rafto Prize prior to the Nobel Peace Prize.

Typically, mathematicians are interested in q-analogs that arise naturally, rather than in arbitrarily contriving q-analogs of known results. The earliest q-analog studied in detail is the basic hypergeometric series, which was introduced in the 19th century.Exton, H. (1983), q-Hypergeometric Functions and Applications, New York: Halstead Press, Chichester: Ellis Horwood, 1983, , , q-analogues are most frequently studied in the mathematical fields of combinatorics and special functions. In these settings, the limit is often formal, as is often discrete-valued (for example, it may represent a prime power). q-analogs find applications in a number of areas, including the study of fractals and multi- fractal measures, and expressions for the entropy of chaotic dynamical systems. The relationship to fractals and dynamical systems results from the fact that many fractal patterns have the symmetries of Fuchsian groups in general (see, for example Indra's pearls and the Apollonian gasket) and the modular group in particular. The connection passes through hyperbolic geometry and ergodic theory, where the elliptic integrals and modular forms play a prominent role; the q-series themselves are closely related to elliptic integrals. q-analogs also appear in the study of quantum groups and in q-deformed superalgebras. The connection here is similar, in that much of string theory is set in the language of Riemann surfaces, resulting in connections to elliptic curves, which in turn relate to q-series. \\"Classical\\" q-theory Classical q-theory begins with the q-analogs of the nonnegative integers. The equality :\\\\lim_{q\\\\rightarrow 1}\\\\frac{1-q^n}{1-q}=n suggests that we define the q-analog of n, also known as the q-bracket or q-number of n, to be :[n]_q=\\\\frac{1-q^n}{1-q} = 1 + q + q^2 + \\\\ldots + q^{n - 1}. By itself, the choice of this particular q-analog among the many possible options is unmotivated. However, it appears naturally in several contexts. For example, having decided to use [n]q as the q-analog of n, one may define the q-analog of the factorial, known as the q-factorial, by : \\\\begin{align} \\\\big[n]_q! & =[1]_q \\\\cdot [2]_q \\\\cdots [n-1]_q \\\\cdot [n]_q \\\\[6pt] & =\\\\frac{1-q}{1-q} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1-q^2}{1-q} \\\\cdots \\\\frac{1-q^{n-1}}{1-q} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1-q^n}{1-q} \\\\[6pt] & =1\\\\cdot (1+q)\\\\cdots (1+q+\\\\cdots + q^{n-2}) \\\\cdot (1+q+\\\\cdots + q^{n-1}). \\\\end{align} This q-analog appears naturally in several contexts. Notably, while n! counts the number of permutations of length n, [n]q! counts permutations while keeping track of the number of inversions. That is, if inv(w) denotes the number of inversions of the permutation w and Sn denotes the set of permutations of length n, we have : \\\\sum_{w \\\\in S_n} q^{\\\\text{inv}(w)} = [n]_q ! . In particular, one recovers the usual factorial by taking the limit as q\\\\rightarrow 1. The q-factorial also has a concise definition in terms of the q-Pochhammer symbol, a basic building-block of all q-theories: :[n]_q!=\\\\frac{(q;q)_n}{(1-q)^n}. From the q-factorials, one can move on to define the q-binomial coefficients, also known as Gaussian coefficients, Gaussian polynomials, or Gaussian binomial coefficients: : \\\\binom{n}{k}_q = \\\\frac{[n]_q!}{[n-k]_q! [k]_q!}. The q-exponential is defined as: :e_q^x = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{x^n}{[n]_q!}. q-trigonometric functions, along with a q-Fourier transform have been defined in this context. =Combinatorial q-analogs= The Gaussian coefficients count subspaces of a finite vector space. Let q be the number of elements in a finite field. (The number q is then a power of a prime number, , so using the letter q is especially appropriate.) Then the number of k-dimensional subspaces of the n-dimensional vector space over the q-element field equals : \\\\binom nk_q . Letting q approach 1, we get the binomial coefficient : \\\\binom nk, or in other words, the number of k-element subsets of an n-element set. Thus, one can regard a finite vector space as a q-generalization of a set, and the subspaces as the q-generalization of the subsets of the set. This has been a fruitful point of view in finding interesting new theorems. For example, there are q-analogs of Sperner's theorem and Ramsey theory. =Cyclic sieving= Let q = (e2i/n)d be the d-th power of a primitive n-th root of unity. Let C be a cyclic group of order n generated by an element c. Let X be the set of k-element subsets of the n-element set {1, 2, ..., n}. The group C has a canonical action on X given by sending c to the cyclic permutation (1, 2, ..., n). Then the number of fixed points of cd on X is equal to : \\\\binom nk_q .  q → 1  Conversely, by letting q vary and seeing q-analogs as deformations, one can consider the combinatorial case of as a limit of q-analogs as (often one cannot simply let in the formulae, hence the need to take a limit). This can be formalized in the field with one element, which recovers combinatorics as linear algebra over the field with one element: for example, Weyl groups are simple algebraic groups over the field with one element. Applications in the physical sciences q-analogs are often found in exact solutions of many-body problems. In such cases, the limit usually corresponds to relatively simple dynamics, e.g., without nonlinear interactions, while gives insight into the complex nonlinear regime with feedbacks. An example from atomic physics is the model of molecular condensate creation from an ultra cold fermionic atomic gas during a sweep of an external magnetic field through the Feshbach resonance. This process is described by a model with a q-deformed version of the SU(2) algebra of operators, and its solution is described by q-deformed exponential and binomial distributions.

History New housing The area was settled around 1816 by people of English descent and was named in the early nineteenth century for its location as the midpoint between the then-towns of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and Jamaica, Queens, on the Williamsburgh and Jamaica Turnpike (now Metropolitan Avenue), which opened in 1816. It was generally sparsely populated because the large Juniper Swamp was in the area. The swamp, an area where the Americans hid from British in the American Revolutionary War, was originally circumscribed by a \\"Juniper Round Swamp Road\\". In 1852, a Manhattan Lutheran church purchased the farmland on the western end of the hamlet. After the Civil War, the area became predominantly German. The Williamsburgh and Jamaica Turnpike became an un- tolled road by 1873, and St. John Roman Catholic Cemetery was laid out on the eastern side of the town in 1879.Seyfried, V.F. and Asadorian, W. (1991). Old Queens, NY in Early Photographs, Mineola, NY: Dover. Hotels and other services appeared to meet the needs of cemetery visitors. The western part of Middle Village was called \\"Metropolitan\\" until prior to World War I. The Juniper Swamp was filled in 1915. In 1920, the area was renamed \\"Juniper Valley\\" as part of a revitalization project. Shortly after, gangster Arnold Rothstein bought of the land, erected facades of houses on that land, and tried to sell these houses, but not before he tried to sell the land to the city as an airport.Juniper Valley Park, New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. Accessed May 16, 2008. A housing boom that began in the 1920s eventually consumed the surrounding farmland and became continuous with neighboring towns and neighborhoods. Originally, homes were built by two major builders—the Nansen Building Corporation, and Baier & Bauer. Charles Baier's first project in the area was the Parkville Homes in 1927, a group of 30 homes at Juniper Valley Road and 77th Place. With Ridgewood developer August Bauer, they built 150 single-family row houses by 1928. In 1931, Bauer, collaborating with builder Paul Stier, built some 7-room houses at 78th Street and Furmanville Avenue.

The entirety of Community Board 5, which comprises Maspeth, Ridgewood, Middle Village, and Glendale, had 166,924 inhabitants as of NYC Health's 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 81.4 years. This is about equal to the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are youth and middle-aged adults: 22% are between the ages of 0–17, 31% between 25–44, and 26% between 45–64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 8% and 13% respectively. As of 2017, the median household income in Community Board 5 was $71,234. In 2018, an estimated 19% of Middle Village, Ridgewood, and Maspeth residents lived in poverty, compared to 19% in all of Queens and 20% in all of New York City. One in seventeen residents (6%) were unemployed, compared to 8% in Queens and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 46% in Middle Village, Ridgewood, and Maspeth, lower than the boroughwide and citywide rates of 53% and 51% respectively.

The population in Middle Village has been historically German American. Later, it became Irish American, Italian American, and Yugoslavian-American, although Middle Village has seen an influx of Polish people, Eastern Europeans, Hispanic Americans, and Chinese Americans (mostly in South Elmhurst, after a ZIP Code change in the early 2000s). Many of the older families have left Middle Village but have not sold their homes but rather passed them down to their children; the result is many second and third generation residents.11379 Zip Code Detailed Profile, City-data.com.

Points of interest Metro Mall Metro Mall is a shopping mall on Metropolitan Avenue just west of the neighborhood's subway station. In 1920, the C.B. French Company, which made telephone booths for the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (now AT&T;), built a factory on what is now the site of Metro Mall. After the C.B. French Company was acquired by the Turner-Armour Company, which was in turn acquired by the Western Electric Company, Western Electric continued to operate the plant and make telephone booths for AT&T.; The plant was closed by around 1965, after which United Merchants and Manufacturers Inc. acquired the land and built a three-story mall on the site between 1972–4. In the 2010s, the Metro Mall suffered the same problem many malls around the United States did of the \\"retail apocalypse\\"; most of its tenants departed, most notably K-Mart and Toys R Us, leaving BJ's Wholesale Club as the only remaining large store as of 2019. The Frank T. Lang Building at Metropolitan Avenue and 69th Street The Frank T. Lang Building, at Metropolitan Avenue and 69th Street, was constructed in 1904. It is named after Frank Lang, who built mausoleums and monuments. The building, which sold mausoleums and monuments until 1946, also used to have an \\"H.C. Bohack\\" gas station, operated by the same man who also headed the Bohack grocery store chain. The two-story art deco building is notable for imposing gargoyles and finely chiseled faces on its roof. Niederstein's, a renowned local restaurant, was located at 69-16 Metropolitan Avenue until it was demolished in 2005. The site, located near present-day 69th Street, was prime real estate in the early 19th century. Isaac Ferguson, who owned of land at the site, sold of his land to John Heuss, having been loath to give his land to the Geissenhainers of Lutheran Cemetery due to Ferguson's concerns that the tract was worth more than what the Geissenhainers would have paid for it. Huess later sold the land to Henry Schumacher, a then-27-year-old Württemberg native. In 1850, Schumacher built a 2-story wooden roadside lodge, called the Schumacher's Lager Beer Saloon and Hotel, on the Williamsburgh and Jamaica Turnpike. Ferguson sold the remaining to Schumacher in 1864, by which time the area's hotels were booming in popularity. In 1888, Schumacher was dead and his wife, Catharina Sutter, sold the building and the business to John Niederstein, a German cook. Niederstein built 32 rooms with two wings and operated the lodge as a hotel. Henrietta Gabriel, John Niederstein's granddaughter, bought the business from Grace, Niederstein's daughter-in-law, in 1920. In 1969, Gabriel sold the hotel to Reiner and Horst Herink, who operated the structure as a restaurant. Once patronized by 130 thousand annual diners, the restaurant became less popular by the 1990s. Because of its many modifications, the building was ineligible for landmarking by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. The property was sold in the early 2000s and demolished in September 2005 to make way for an Arby's restaurant. The Arion Theater, a one-screen, 970-seat theater at Metropolitan Avenue and 74th Street, was built in 1921 and was the first theater in Queens that had wiring for loudspeakers. It closed in the mid-1980s because of a never-implemented plan to turn the structure into a triplex. Instead, the theater was converted to a RiteAid drugstore—which closed in 2009—and then to a Spirit Halloween superstore. , the site is a Salvation Army location. The Artistic Building, on Metropolitan Avenue between 79th and 80th Streets, is a 1930 structure that is notable for having friezes of biblical scenes on its facade. , it was a tailor's shop. There are also some very old houses in Middle Village. The Morrell House, built by English settler Thomas Morrell, was built in 1719 on present-day Juniper Valley Road; the house was demolished in 1985. By 1995, two other historical houses were slated for demolition by the same developer who demolished the Morrell House. In 2005, though, the Juniper Park Civic Association successfully petitioned to get parts of Maspeth and Middle Village rezoned to prevent aggressive redevelopment. An old farmhouse on Furmanville Avenue, built in the 1890s, still exists . =Cemeteries and crematory= The gatehouse of Lutheran Cemetery The Lutheran All Faiths Cemetery, at 67-29 Metropolitan Avenue, opened in Middle Village in 1852, due to the 1847 Rural Cemetery Act, which banned new cemeteries in Manhattan. The General Slocum Steamboat Fire Mass Memorial, commemorating the 1904 sinking of the PS General Slocum that killed 1,021 people, is at Lutheran All Faiths Cemetery. The cemetery is also the burial place of Fred Trump and Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, parents of U.S. President Donald Trump. US Crematorium Company, formerly Fresh Pond Columbarium Near the Lutheran All Faiths Cemetery, on Mount Olivet Crescent, is the Fresh Pond Crematory and Columbarium, which has operated since the late 19th century. Baseball player Lou Gehrig, screenwriter Ring Lardner, Sr., businessman J.P. Morgan, and Richard Hauptmann—notable for the Lindbergh kidnapping—are among the people cremated there. The crematory, the third- oldest in the United States, was erected in 1884 and started cremating people a year later. The columbarium was built in 1893 and expanded in 1898; the two- building complex was further enlarged in 1904 and 1910. The Pullis Farm Cemetery, a small burial plot in Juniper Valley Park, is a gated mini-cemetery dating back to 1846. As many as eight members of the Pullis family are interred in the plot. The cemetery became overgrown was weeds and was restored in 1993–6 with a new headstone. It is one of the few farm burial grounds still located in New York City. Many famous people's graves are located in Middle Village. St. John Cemetery, a cemetery located in Middle Village, holds many famed mobsters, including John Gotti, Lucky Luciano, Joe Gallo, Carlo Gambino, Joseph Profaci, Joe Colombo, Vito Genovese and Carmine Galante. Also buried here are fitness guru Charles Atlas, politicians Geraldine Ferraro and Mario Cuomo, slain New York City police officer Rafael Ramos, and photographer Robert Mapplethorpe. Religious institutions The United Community Methodist Church (founded as the Methodist Episcopal Church of Newtown), the first Methodist church in Middle Village, is located near the present-day intersection of Juniper Valley Road and 80th Street. The church, originally built in 1769, was moved to Metropolitan Avenue near 75th Street in 1836, and was rebuilt in 1901 and 1926. The Trinity Lutheran Church was founded in 1851 in the Lutheran-All Faiths Cemetery. A school was founded in the church in 1861, and the church burned just two years later. Then, it moved to 69th Street. At the 69th Street site, the school burned down in 1895 and the church burned down in 1906. Another church was built on the 69th Street site, but it was structurally damaged by lightning damage in 1975 and completely burned in a 1977 fire. The church's third structure, built in 1979, is located on a plot of land bounded by present-day Penelope Avenue, Dry Harbor Road, Juniper Boulevard South, and 81st Street. The bells and cornerstones from the first two churches are the only remnants of the original structures, and are located in front of the original church. St. Margaret’s Roman Catholic Church, a church and attached school built in 1860, was used during the American Civil War as a temporary jail. The church and school were both reconstructed—the school in 1899 and the church in 1907. In 1935, they moved to a four-story structure on Juniper Valley Road near 80th Street. Our Lady of Hope is a hexagonal structure on Eliot Avenue with a bell tower and is located just north of the New York Connecting Railroad. The church was built in 1965. There used to be many synagogues in Middle Village, due to an influx of Jewish residents in the early 20th century. The Hebrew Institute of Middle Village was a rabbinical seminary, built in 1919 next to a synagogue that existed from 1909 to the 1970s; the building that housed the Hebrew Institute of Middle Village is now occupied by the Middle Village Adult Center. The Holy Archangels Michael & Gabriel Romanian Orthodox Church moved into a former synagogue in 1997, but the synagogue itself dates back to 1921. The only extant synagogue in the area, the Congregation of Forest Hills West, was founded in 1935.

They lie approximately 3 miles south-east of the city centre, and are bounded by the suburbs of Coney Hill to the north west, Barnwood and Hucclecote to the north and north east, Matson to the south west and the M5 motorway to the south and east. Mostly connected with Segregated Bicycle Paths into Gloucester city along Metz Way. The village of Upton St Leonards is directly across the M5 motorway. The two suburbs are contiguous and share many amenities but there is clear definition of where Abbeydale ends and Abbeymead begins. History Most of the Abbeydale area was green fields until around 1970, when the Heron Park development was constructed by Heron Homesteads. At that stage, it was officially known as \\"The Land to the East\\" An example of Radburn design housing in Abbeydale, with Redpoll Way (left) facing Redstart Way across a green space. Road access is to the rear of the houses. The first two-thirds of Heron Park appears to have been designed in accordance with the Radburn model. It consists of loops and cul-de-sacs radiating from a central spine road, Heron Way, giving access to the rear of the houses where there are garages and hard-standings. The houses face each other across interconnecting pathways and green spaces, so that pedestrians are largely separated from traffic. In keeping with the developer's brand name, the streets were named after British birds. The area is almost identical to a Heron development in Yate, South Gloucestershire which was built around the same time and even has its own Heron Way. Later parts of Heron Park, such as Hawthorne and Bittern Avenues completed around 1981, were not built to the Radburn model. Because Fieldfare linked the Radburn-built houses and conventional houses of the new part, those houses in Swift and Woodcock which faced onto Fieldfare were re- named and re-numbered as Fieldfare. In 1975, contracts were signed for the construction of Heron Primary School, which opened in 1977. The Glevum Way Shopping Centre opened in 1981, with a Safeway supermarket and a handful of small shops. Over the following few years, a community centre, a doctor's surgery, a pub (the Ridge & Furrow, operated by Courage) and a veterinary clinic were built beside the centre. In the 1980s, the Community Centre was built, initially without the current sports facilities. On the evening of 4th August 1983, the Safeway store was evacuated when fire broke out, severely damaging the building. In 2005, the shopping complex was demolished to make way from a new, larger Morrisons store, but using the plans which Safeway already had bulding permission for before being taken over by Morrison. The pub was closed by Morrisons around 2012, to make way for a petrol station, which was turned down by planners, and has since reopened. The second half of what became known as Abbeydale, was started around 1976, with further development on land between Heron Park and the M5. These homes were constructed by the Robert Hitchins and Glevum Estates building companies and are distinguished from Heron Park by their more conventional layout and different house designs. Most houses face the road, have front driveways and garages, and are similar to those built by the same companies in Quedgeley. These developments, which lie either side of Wheatway, were completed around 1982-1986. When the road, Wheatway, was built, it bisected The Wheatridge and the part nearest the M5 motorway was called The Wheatridge East. This newer part of Abbeydale is separated from the older Heron Park by The Wheatridge - a lane of former farmworkers' cottages and larger country houses leading from Painswick Road (B4073). Around 1983, plots of land at the top of The Wheatridge were sold for the construction of individually designed homes and a small housing development. A small church, Christchurch, Abbeydale, was built and opened in 1995. From 1986, further housing development began on farmland between Abbeydale and Barnwood and became known as Abbeymead. It was connected to Abbeydale with the construction of its main artery, Abbeymead Avenue, designated the Eastern Radial Road, a high speed roadway into Gloucester, which was to have had a flyover across Eastern Avenue; never built. To cater for road safety, with an original speed limit of 40 mph, no houses on Abbeymead Avenue actually face directly on the road. Smaller, piecemeal developments have continued to be added, turning Abbeymead into one of the more populous suburbs of the city. Lobleys Drive is an important spine road off Abbeymead Avenue, leading, over the M5, into Coopers Edge development and Brockworth Trading Estate. Local government For administrative purposes, the suburb is covered by three electoral wards. The majority of residents live in the Abbey ward, the north eastern area is in the Hucclecote ward, and the northern area is in the Barnwood ward. The councillors currently representing Abbeymead are as follows: *Abbey ward: Gordon Taylor (Conservative); Laura Pearsall (Conservative); Andrew Gravells (Conservative) *Barnwood ward: Lise Noakes (Conservative); John McLellan (Liberal Democrat); Phill McLellan (Liberal Democrat) *Hucclecote ward: David Brown (Liberal Democrat); Jonathan Whittaker (Liberal Democrat); Declan Wilson (Liberal Democrat) Amenities The biggest suburban shopping outlet, next to Heron Way (Abbeydale) has five shops in addition to the Morrisons supermarket, Taylors (Estate Agents), Ruby Cantonese/Dave's Fish & Chip shop, Coral Betting Shop, plus Sue Ryder Care charity shop. Adjacent is the Ridge & Furrow Pub, Hadwen Doctors' Surgery/Pharmacy and Veterinary Surgery. Part of the shopping complex includes a community centre with an all-weather pitch. Straight across Abbeymead Avenue are several other small retail units. Heron Primary School in Heron Way and Abbeymead Primary School in Abbeymead Avenue are the only two schools in the area and both serve 4- to 11-year-olds. Near to the latter is also a children's playground. By Abbeymead School is another pub, called The Turmut Hoer, and a small row of shops, a Tesco Express, hairdresser, two estate agents, fish & chip shop and The Polash Indian restaurant. Among Abbeymead's many open spaces lies a skateboarding amenity, Clock Tower Park and, further away, a local nature reserve at Hucclecote Meadows, which has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). As the area is now virtually fully built up, it is unlikely that Abbeydale/Abbeymead will see any real expansion. Large-scale residential development is in progress, however, at Brockworth, on the other side of the M5 motorway, linked from Abbeymead Avenue by Lobleys Drive. Nearby is also a large business park, on the site of the old Brockworth Aerodrome, with a large Tesco Supermarket, Whittle Inn pub, Premier Inn Hotel and several other shops. The whole area is served by several frequent bus routes operated by Stagecoach West, the 2, 2A, 8 and 13.

Directed by Greg Beeman, it was his last theatrical film before he moved on to direct television films for Disney Channel beginning in 1997. This also marked Sullivan's last theatrical film appearance before his retirement in 2000 and death in 2008. The film was originally conceived as a spin off film to the Home Alone franchise with Daniel Stern reprising his role as a reformed Marv explaining Max Grabelski's similar appearance and personality to Marv. Plot Deliveryman \\"Mad\\" Max Grabelski (Daniel Stern) is charged with delivering packages to millionaire Reinhart Bragdon (Anthony Heald) for $50 tips. During a late night delivery, Max accidentally stumbles across a fire in Bragdon's mansion and is cornered by FBI Agent Palmer (Jon Polito), but accidentally picks up Agent Palmer's gun and manages to escape. Max later sees a news report in which Palmer claims that Bragdon was killed in the fire, which was set up by Max to stop him from exposing a money-laundering conspiracy. Now on the run from the law, Max contacts his boss and learns that a final package is to be delivered to Bragdon, but at his mountain cabin in Devil's Peak. Max heads for Devil's Peak to clear his name, but a store clerk and scoutmaster Jack Erickson (Brad Sullivan) recognize his face and he is forced to threaten both with his gun, gluing Erickson to his car's steering wheel and ordering him to drive off to lure the police away while stealing Erickson's van. He is subsequently mistaken for a scoutmaster scheduled to lead a group of boy scouts on an expedition. Max goes along with the ruse to keep heading for Devil's Peak. The FBI find and release Erickson, and set up a base of operations at a nearby cabin while Palmer and Erickson pursue Max and the scouts. Though they are nearly captured, Max cuts the bridge between two cliffs, forcing Palmer and Erickson to take the longer route. Along the way, the scouts build a makeshift radio and learn who Max truly is. They lace his water with sleeping pills and use smoke signs to signal their location to Erickson. Max ends up sedated, but Palmer handcuffs Erickson to a tree and captures Max alone, promising the scouts a rescue helicopter, but the suspicious scouts follow in secret. Max awakens and Palmer leads him to a helicopter, where Max discovers Bragdon is alive and is revealed that he is a criminal and that Palmer is one of his henchman and their plan was to steal the laundered money from the authorities and Bragdon faking his death after coming under suspicion in order to frame Max. Before they can kill Max, the scouts intervene and knock Palmer out, but Max falls into the river and the scouts follow. They reach safety and throw their backpacks in the river to drive Palmer and Bragdon off. Out of supplies, the scouts decide to remain with Max and help him reach Devil's Peak. Meanwhile, one of the scouts' mothers, Mrs. Patterson (Ann Dowd) uncovers Max's discarded tissue and realizes that he is leading them to Devil's Peak, and gives chase in her van when Palmer's bumbling assistant, Agent McMurrey (Thomas Mills Wood), refuses to help her. She arrives first, but is captured by Bragdon. Max and the scouts arrive as Bragdon receives the final package. Palmer catches up and prepares to kill them, but is subdued by Erickson, who freed himself and followed Max. Max sneaks into the cabin to free Mrs. Patterson. Bragdon appears and forces them to the edge of the cliff at gunpoint. Mrs. Patterson's son, Gordy (Blake Bashoff), charges Bragdon but falls over a cliff and hangs onto a branch for his life. Max knocks Bragdon out and climbs down the cliff and pulls Gordy to safety. With Bragdon and Palmer captured, Max's name is cleared and in response to his efforts, he is awarded a scoutmaster's honor and given charge of an even bigger group of scouts for a more challenging mission, to his chagrin.

It acts as a northerly alternate route to the New York State Thruway (I-90), leaving it at exit 47 in the town of Le Roy and rejoining the highway at exit 45 in the town of Victor to the east. I-490 connects with I-390 and New York State Route 390 (NY 390) on the western side of Rochester and I-590 and NY 590 on the east side of the city at an interchange known as the Can of Worms. The highway comprises the southernmost portion of the Inner Loop, a beltway around the interior of Rochester. Outside of the city, I-490 serves several suburban villages, such as Churchville and Pittsford. The eastern half of the freeway, named the Eastern Expressway, was built in stages from the 1950s to the 1970s as a connector between the Inner Loop and the Thruway, and the section west of the Inner Loop and Downtown Rochester to (I-90) in Le Roy is known as the Western Expressway. From downtown Rochester to the Can of Worms, it follows the former right-of-way of the Rochester Subway and, before it, the Erie Canal. The section west of the Inner Loop was mostly built during the 1960s and completed in the early 1970s. During the 1950s and early 1960s, the portion of the Eastern Expressway from what is now the Can of Worms east to Bushnell's Basin was originally designated as part of NY 96\\\\. That route was moved back onto its parallel surface routing when I-490 was assigned to the entirety of the then-proposed Le Roy–Victor freeway. Route description I-490 eastbound west of Downtown Rochester in the final stages of the Western Gateway project Heading northeast from exit 47 of the New York State Thruway (I-90), I-490 passes through rural portions of eastern Genesee County and western Monroe County, skirting the villages of Bergen and Churchville. Gradually, the expressway takes a more easterly alignment near exit 3 before returning to the northeast at exit 4\\\\. At exit 6, I-490 intersects the Airport Expressway (NY 204). Past this interchange, I-490 heads due north, connecting to NY 33 and NY 531 before returning east. Prior to crossing the Erie Canal, I-490 meets NY 390 and I-390. Beyond the junction lies the canal and the city of Rochester. Between the Mount Read Boulevard interchange at exit 10 and the Genesee River, I-490 is referred to as the \\"Western Gateway\\". This section, which saw major decorative and structural improvements in the late 2000s, travels due east through heavily residential neighborhoods before turning to the southeast near Frontier Field and a junction with the Inner Loop at exit 13\\\\. Just west of this point, I-490 passes over West Broad Street (NY 31) and close to the former Rochester terminal of the Buffalo, Rochester, and Pittsburgh Railway, which now houses Nick Tahou Hots. I-490 now becomes part of the Inner Loop as it passes just south of the city center and heads toward the Genesee River. I-490 crosses both the river and NY 383 by way of the Frederick Douglass–Susan B. Anthony Memorial Bridge and connects to NY 15 before leaving the Inner Loop and turning south and east to follow the former pathway of the Erie Canal and the Rochester Subway through the east side of the city. Along this stretch, I-490 connects to NY 31 (now part of Monroe Avenue) and passes north of Cobbs Hill Reservoir and the surrounding Cobbs Hill Park. I-490 westbound at the Can of Worms I-490 continues to run in the former bed until exit 21, where I-490 connects to NY 590 and I-590 at an interchange known locally as the Can of Worms. At this point, the former Erie Canal route (now part of I-590) curves southward while I-490 continues eastward into the eastern suburbs of Rochester. Between exits 21 and 24, I-490 parallels the CSX Transportation- owned Rochester Subdivision rail line, intersecting NY 441, a four-lane divided highway in the process. South of exit 25, I-490 traverses the southeastern suburbs of Rochester, passing close to East Rochester, Pittsford and Bushnell's Basin and closely paralleling NY 96 on its way toward the Ontario County line. The freeway meets NY 96 twice in Perinton and a third time in the Ontario County town of Victor, where I-490 passes along the western fringe of Eastview Mall. I-490 ends a short distance southeast of the third NY 96 interchange at Thruway exit 45. History The portion of I-490 from exit 15 southeast to the Can of Worms follows the original path of the Erie Canal through the city of Rochester. After the canal was rerouted to bypass Rochester in 1920, the former canal bed was purchased by the city for roughly $1.5 million (equivalent to $ in ). Plans drawn up by the city in the early 1910s called for a highway to be built in the old canal bed; however, subsequent proposals leaned toward repurposing the bed as a rapid transit system instead. The Rochester Subway, as it became known, began operation in 1927. As ridership on the line declined in the 1940s and early 1950s, the city elected to shut the subway down in 1956 and use the right-of-way for a new highway connecting the Inner Loop to the recently completed New York State Thruway south of Rochester. Construction of the Eastern Expressway, a limited- access highway connecting the Inner Loop to the Thruway in Victor, began in the early 1950s with the first section extending from NY 96 in Bushnell's Basin to NY 31F near East Rochester. It was completed by 1956 and originally designated as part of NY 96. An extension northwest to the present site of the Can of Worms was opened to traffic by the following year. The expressway remained part of NY 96 until when it was designated as part of I-490, a proposed route extending westward through downtown Rochester and southwestward through the western suburbs to Thruway exit 47 in Le Roy. The portion of the highway between the Inner Loop and Winton Road was completed in the old subway cut by this time, while the segment between Winton Road and the Can of Worms was opened . Work on the portion of I-490 west of the Inner Loop began and initially extended from NY 259 in Chili to Mount Read Boulevard west of downtown. This section was completed by the following year. The remainder of the freeway west of Rochester was opened to traffic as far west as NY 36 near Churchville and finished by 1968. The last two gaps in the freeway—from Mount Read Boulevard east to the Inner Loop in Rochester and from Bushnell's Basin southeast to the Thruway in Pittsford and Victor—were filled in the early 1970s. The planned construction of the Inner Loop (now part of I-490) through the Corn Hill district of downtown Rochester just west of the Genesee River was the driving factor that led the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) to relocate to its present location in Henrietta in 1968.

The western terminus is a junction with I-90 and I-71 on Cleveland's west side. After spanning the Cuyahoga River, I-490 reaches its eastern terminus at a junction with East 55th Street, just east of I-77. History The original plans of the Cleveland and other city and federal highway authorities called for the highway - also known as the Clark Freeway and, at various times and in various sections, as Interstate 80N and Interstate 290 - to bisect the east side of the city and the eastern suburbs; the I-290 designation would then have continued north along I-271.Example: I-71 was to have continued along the Innerbelt to Dead Man's Curve, while I-290 was to have used the portion of present I-90 westward to the Parma Freeway near West 65th Street. Freeway revolts in the late 1960s prevented the Clark Freeway east of East 55th Street and the Parma Freeway from being built; specifically, a referendum in Shaker Heights barred the city from allowing the Clark Freeway to pass through the city and its Shaker Lakes. The Interstate 490 designation was applied to the Clark Freeway's altered proposed path in 1973, but this alignment was also not built east of East 55th Street. Ultimately I-90 was realigned to follow the Clark Freeway routing west of I-71 and the Innerbelt, and the middle segment of the Clark Freeway between I-71 and I-77 opened in 1990. The Opportunity Corridor expressway is being constructed to follow the path of the cancelled portion of I-490/Clark Freeway eastward from the end of the completed portion until it veers north toward the University Circle neighborhood. In 2003, I-490 was dedicated to Troy Lee James, former member of the Ohio House of Representatives. In April 2011, the ramps between I-77 and I-90 to the west were removed, making I-490 the official route between those highways and between I-77 and I-71.\\"Two Interstate 77/90 Ramps to Close Permanently as Part of Innerbelt Work\\" (press release).

The new theatre, 31 July 2007 History Under the supervision of the Christie family, the festival has been held annually since 1934, except in 1941–45 during World War II and 1993 when the theatre was being rebuilt, for a 1994 reopening. Gus Christie, son of Sir George Christie and grandson of festival founder John Christie, became festival chairman in 2000. Glyndebourne House, 1 August 2006 Since the company's inception, Glyndebourne has been particularly celebrated for its productions of Mozart operas. Recordings of Glyndebourne's past historic Mozart productions have been reissued. Other notable productions included their 1980s production of George Gershwin's Porgy and Bess, directed by Trevor Nunn, and later expanded from the Glyndebourne stage and videotaped in 1993 for television, with Nunn again directing. While Mozart operas have continued to be the mainstay of its repertory, the company has expanded it with productions of Janáček and Handel operas. The primary resident orchestra for the Glyndebourne Festival is the London Philharmonic Orchestra (since 1964). The festival's associate orchestra is the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment. In January 2014, Robin Ticciati became the seventh music director of the company. Past general directors of the festival have included David Pickard. In November 2015, the festival announced the appointment of Sebastian F. Schwarz as its general director, effective in May 2016. In March 2018 Schwarz stepped down as general director. In August 2018, the festival announced the appointment of Stephen Langridge as its next artistic director, effective in the spring of 2019. The festival operates without subsidy. Its first placement of advertisements was in 2003. The festival has planned to incorporate power by wind turbine, as part of its \\"green\\" initiatives. Many Glyndebourne attendees come from London, and the event is regarded as part of the English summer season. Performances start in the afternoon, enabling Londoners to leave town after lunch, and finish in time for them to catch the last train back. A long interval allows opera-goers the opportunity for picnic dinners on the extensive lawns or in one of the restaurants in the grounds. Annually in London, the company presents an opera performance at The Proms.

In addition to bringing the work of Glyndebourne Festival Opera to audiences some distance from Glyndebourne, Glyndebourne Touring Opera offers opportunities for younger opera singers to develop their craft. In 2003, the Glyndebourne Touring Opera administrative duties were absorbed back into the main Glyndebourne Festival Opera administration, and the touring company was renamed Glyndebourne on Tour. The touring company now has the name of Glyndebourne Tour. Unlike Glyndebourne Festival Opera, Glyndebourne Tour does receive some subsidy, from the Arts Council England. The tour takes place in autumn following the festival season, and typically includes three weeks of performances at Glyndebourne, followed by one week in each of the other locations. The touring ensemble has separate music directors is as follows: * Myer Fredman (1968–1974) * Kenneth Montgomery (1975–1976) * Nicholas Braithwaite (1977–1980) * Jane Glover (1982–1985)Norwich, p. 226, lists the first four GTO music directors * Graeme Jenkins (1986–1991) * Ivor Bolton (1992–1997) * Louis Langrée (1998–2003) * Edward Gardner (2004–2007) * Robin Ticciati (2007–2009) * Jakub Hrůša (2010–2012) Ticciati is the first former music director of Glyndebourne on Tour to be named music director of the full Glyndebourne Opera company. In November 2018, the company announced the appointment of Ben Glassberg as the new principal conductor of the Glyndebourne Tour, with a set contract of 3 years. Glyndebourne Festival Opera has also toured internationally, including the Adelaide Festival in 2006 with its production of Flight by Jonathan Dove and April De Angelis. Finances Glyndebourne is constituted as a registered charity called Glyndebourne Productions Limited, which is a company limited by guarantee. It has a wholly owned subsidiary, Glyndebourne Enterprises Limited, which carries out merchandising, production hire and media development activities, and donates its profits to the charity. A related charity called the Glyndebourne Arts Trust carries out fund-raising activities. Glyndebourne Association America allows residents of the United States to make tax efficient donations to Glyndebourne. Glyndebourne has an annual budget of a little over £20 million, as of 2010. The Festival is the only major opera season in the United Kingdom which is not state subsidised. Glyndebourne on Tour receives an annual subsidy of around £1.5 million from Arts Council England, but is budgeted to make an annual loss even after this has been credited. The shortfall is covered by an internal cross subsidy. Other media The Glyndebourne Label was established in 2008 to release live recordings on CD. Commercial releases have included Mozart's Idomeneo (with Luciano Pavarotti and Gundula Janowitz), Dvořák's Rusalka and Benjamin Britten's Billy Budd. During the music directorship of Vladimir Jurowski, the festival began its \\"Glyndebourne on Screen\\" programme, for viewers to see performances from the festival in cinemas and live-streaming on personal computers, the latter in partnership with The Guardian newspaper.

It provides a mechanism for the receiver to control the transmission speed, so that the receiving node is not overwhelmed with data from transmitting node. Flow control should be distinguished from congestion control, which is used for controlling the flow of data when congestion has actually occurred. Flow control mechanisms can be classified by whether or not the receiving node sends feedback to the sending node. Flow control is important because it is possible for a sending computer to transmit information at a faster rate than the destination computer can receive and process it. This can happen if the receiving computers have a heavy traffic load in comparison to the sending computer, or if the receiving computer has less processing power than the sending computer. Stop-and-wait Stop-and- wait flow control is the simplest form of flow control. In this method the message is broken into multiple frames, and the receiver indicates its readiness to receive a frame of data. The sender waits for a receipt acknowledgement (ACK) after every frame for a specified time (called a time out). The receiver sends the ACK to let the sender know that the frame of data was received correctly. The sender will then send the next frame only after the ACK. = Operations = # Sender: Transmits a single frame at a time. #Sender waits to receive ACK within time out. # Receiver: Transmits acknowledgement (ACK) as it receives a frame. # Go to step 1 when ACK is received, or time out is hit. If a frame or ACK is lost during transmission then the frame is re-transmitted. This re-transmission process is known as ARQ (automatic repeat request). The problem with Stop-and-wait is that only one frame can be transmitted at a time, and that often leads to inefficient transmission, because until the sender receives the ACK it cannot transmit any new packet. During this time both the sender and the channel are unutilised. = Pros and cons of stop and wait = Pros The only advantage of this method of flow control is its simplicity. Cons The sender needs to wait for the ACK after every frame it transmits. This is a source of inefficiency, and is particularly bad when the propagation delay is much longer than the transmission delay. Stop and wait can also create inefficiencies when sending longer transmissions. When longer transmissions are sent there is more likely chance for error in this protocol. If the messages are short the errors are more likely to be detected early. More inefficiency is created when single messages are broken into separate frames because it makes the transmission longer.  Sliding Window  A method of flow control in which a receiver gives a transmitter permission to transmit data until a window is full. When the window is full, the transmitter must stop transmitting until the receiver advertises a larger window. Sliding-window flow control is best utilized when the buffer size is limited and pre-established. During a typical communication between a sender and a receiver the receiver allocates buffer space for n frames (n is the buffer size in frames). The sender can send and the receiver can accept n frames without having to wait for an acknowledgement. A sequence number is assigned to frames in order to help keep track of those frames which did receive an acknowledgement. The receiver acknowledges a frame by sending an acknowledgement that includes the sequence number of the next frame expected. This acknowledgement announces that the receiver is ready to receive n frames, beginning with the number specified. Both the sender and receiver maintain what is called a window. The size of the window is less than or equal to the buffer size. Sliding window flow control has far better performance than stop-and-wait flow control. For example, in a wireless environment if data rates are low and noise level is very high, waiting for an acknowledgement for every packet that is transferred is not very feasible. Therefore, transferring data as a bulk would yield a better performance in terms of higher throughput. Sliding window flow control is a point to point protocol assuming that no other entity tries to communicate until the current data transfer is complete. The window maintained by the sender indicates which frames it can send. The sender sends all the frames in the window and waits for an acknowledgement (as opposed to acknowledging after every frame). The sender then shifts the window to the corresponding sequence number, thus indicating that frames within the window starting from the current sequence number can be sent. = Go Back N = An automatic repeat request (ARQ) algorithm, used for error correction, in which a negative acknowledgement (NAK) causes retransmission of the word in error as well as the next N–1 words. The value of N is usually chosen such that the time taken to transmit the N words is less than the round trip delay from transmitter to receiver and back again. Therefore, a buffer is not needed at the receiver. The normalized propagation delay (a) = , where Tp = Length (L) over propagation velocity (V) and Tt = bitrate (r) over Framerate (F). So that a =. To get the utilization you must define a window size (N). If N is greater than or equal to 2a + 1 then the utilization is 1 (full utilization) for the transmission channel. If it is less than 2a + 1 then the equation must be used to compute utilization. = Selective Repeat = Selective Repeat is a connection oriented protocol in which both transmitter and receiver have a window of sequence numbers. The protocol has a maximum number of messages that can be sent without acknowledgement. If this window becomes full, the protocol is blocked until an acknowledgement is received for the earliest outstanding message. At this point the transmitter is clear to send more messages.  Comparison  This section is geared towards the idea of comparing Stop-and-wait, Sliding Window with the subsets of Go Back N and Selective Repeat. = Stop-and-Wait = Error free: \\\\frac{1}{2a + 1}. With errors: \\\\frac{1-P}{2a + 1}. =Selective Repeat = We define throughput T as the average number of blocks communicated per transmitted block. It is more convenient to calculate the average number of transmissions necessary to communicate a block, a quantity we denote by 0, and then to determine T from the equation T = \\\\frac{1}{b}.  Transmit flow control  Transmit flow control may occur: * between data terminal equipment (DTE) and a switching center, via data circuit-terminating equipment (DCE), the opposite types interconnected straightforwardly, * or between two devices of the same type (two DTEs, or two DCEs), interconnected by a crossover cable. The transmission rate may be controlled because of network or DTE requirements. Transmit flow control can occur independently in the two directions of data transfer, thus permitting the transfer rates in one direction to be different from the transfer rates in the other direction. Transmit flow control can be * either stop-and-wait, * or use a sliding window. Flow control can be performed * either by control signal lines in a data communication interface (see serial port and RS-232), * or by reserving in-band control characters to signal flow start and stop (such as the ASCII codes for XON/XOFF). = Hardware flow control = In common RS-232 there are pairs of control lines which are usually referred to as hardware flow control: * RTS (Request To Send) and CTS (Clear To Send), used in RTS flow control * DTR (Data Terminal Ready) and DSR (Data Set Ready), DTR flow control Hardware flow control is typically handled by the DTE or \\"master end\\", as it is first raising or asserting its line to command the other side: * In the case of RTS control flow, DTE sets its RTS, which signals the opposite end (the slave end such as a DCE) to begin monitoring its data input line. When ready for data, the slave end will raise its complementary line, CTS in this example, which signals the master to start sending data, and for the master to begin monitoring the slave's data output line. If either end needs to stop the data, it lowers its respective \\"data readiness\\" line. * For PC-to-modem and similar links, in the case of DTR flow control, DTR/DSR are raised for the entire modem session (say a dialup internet call where DTR is raised to signal the modem to dial, and DSR is raised by the modem when the connection is complete), and RTS/CTS are raised for each block of data. An example of hardware flow control is a Half-duplex radio modem to computer interface. In this case, the controlling software in the modem and computer may be written to give priority to incoming radio signals such that outgoing data from the computer is paused by lowering CTS if the modem detects a reception. * Polarity: ** RS-232 level signals are inverted by the driver ICs, so line polarity is TxD-, RxD-, CTS+, RTS+ (Clear to send when HI, Data 1 is a LO) ** for microprocessor pins the signals are TxD+, RxD+, CTS-, RTS- (Clear to send when LO, Data 1 is a HI) = Software flow control = Conversely, XON/XOFF is usually referred to as software flow control.  Open-loop flow control  The open-loop flow control mechanism is characterized by having no feedback between the receiver and the transmitter. This simple means of control is widely used. The allocation of resources must be a \\"prior reservation\\" or \\"hop-to-hop\\" type. Open-loop flow control has inherent problems with maximizing the utilization of network resources. Resource allocation is made at connection setup using a CAC (Connection Admission Control) and this allocation is made using information that is already \\"old news\\" during the lifetime of the connection. Often there is an over-allocation of resources and reserved but unused capacities are wasted. Open-loop flow control is used by ATM in its CBR, VBR and UBR services (see traffic contract and congestion control). Open-loop flow control incorporates two controls; the controller and a regulator. The regulator is able to alter the input variable in response to the signal from the controller. An open-loop system has no feedback or feed forward mechanism, so the input and output signals are not directly related and there is increased traffic variability. There is also a lower arrival rate in such system and a higher loss rate. In an open control system, the controllers can operate the regulators at regular intervals, but there is no assurance that the output variable can be maintained at the desired level. While it may be cheaper to use this model, the open-loop model can be unstable.  Closed-loop flow control  The closed-loop flow control mechanism is characterized by the ability of the network to report pending network congestion back to the transmitter. This information is then used by the transmitter in various ways to adapt its activity to existing network conditions. Closed-loop flow control is used by ABR (see traffic contract and congestion control). Transmit flow control described above is a form of closed-loop flow control. This system incorporates all the basic control elements, such as, the sensor, transmitter, controller and the regulator. The sensor is used to capture a process variable. The process variable is sent to a transmitter which translates the variable to the controller. The controller examines the information with respect to a desired value and initiates a correction action if required. The controller then communicates to the regulator what action is needed to ensure that the output variable value is matching the desired value. Therefore, there is a high degree of assurance that the output variable can be maintained at the desired level. The closed- loop control system can be a feedback or a feed forward system: A feedback closed-loop system has a feed-back mechanism that directly relates the input and output signals. The feed-back mechanism monitors the output variable and determines if additional correction is required. The output variable value that is fed backward is used to initiate that corrective action on a regulator. Most control loops in the industry are of the feedback type. In a feed-forward closed loop system, the measured process variable is an input variable. The measured signal is then used in the same fashion as in a feedback system. The closed-loop model produces lower loss rate and queuing delays, as well as it results in congestion-responsive traffic. The closed- loop model is always stable, as the number of active lows is bounded.

It is located between Junction Boulevard to the west, 57th Avenue to the north, 99th Street to the east, and the Long Island Expressway to the south. Description The complex of twenty 17-story apartment towers covers and houses over 14,000 people in 4,605 apartments. (Each building's topmost floor is signed as 18, and there are no thirteenth floors.) The buildings are all named after cities or countries around the world and are grouped in clusters of four based on their theme. This naming system came about during the 1964 New York World's Fair, which was located in nearby Flushing Meadows–Corona Park. The development is part of Queens Community Board 4.Queens Community Boards, New York City. Accessed September 3, 2007. The site includes sitting and play areas (including two artificial turf fields), sports courts, a swimming pool, a branch of the Queens Borough Public Library, a post office, two large office buildings, shops, and over 3,500 parking spaces. A $70 million renovation project, which ended in 2017, entailed installing solar panels atop the complex's roofs; updating the facades, boiler rooms, building interiors, swimming pool, and roofs; constructing new play areas; adding wheelchair access; and landscaping the grounds. LeFrak City also contains New York City's first robotic security guard. The Queens Center Mall and Rego Center are both two to three blocks away from the development, as is the Woodhaven Boulevard station on the New York City Subway's . History Named for its developer, the LeFrak Organization (founded by Samuel J. LeFrak), LeFrak City was built in 1962–1971 primarily for working- and middle-class families who were interested in modern facilities but could not afford or did not desire to live in Manhattan. The complex was built atop Horse Brook, a small stream that once wound through Elmhurst along the path of the LIE. The land on which LeFrak City is located was previously undeveloped marshland, and the megablocks of LeFrak City are a remnant of the lack of development on the site. The fortunes of the buildings have been closely tied to housing and social trends in New York in general, and after a period of decline in the 1970s and rapid \\"white flight\\", the complex became home to a very diverse population. The development remains popular with 98% occupancy due to its reasonable rents, and large apartments.

Background Schroeder was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, the son of Florence Ella (Endebrock) and Louis Arthur Schroeder. He had an older sister, Nancy, and a younger brother, Rudy. Schroeder moved with his family to Lorain, Ohio, when he was in elementary school and graduated from Lorain High School where he was an honors student and an outstanding athlete. Already an Eagle Scout, at age 17 Schroeder applied for the Army Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) Scholarship. He received the Academic Achievement award from both the Colorado School of Mines and from Kent State University, where he was a psychology student. He also earned the Association of the United States Army award for excellence in history. Schroeder was killed by a single shot in the chest from an M-1 semi-automatic military rifle. According to reports, he was not taking part in the Vietnam War protests that preceded the shootings, but simply walking between classes.BBC - h2g2 - The Kent State University Shooting of 1970 He, along with Sandra Scheuer, was caught in the gunfire. His college roommate, Lou Cusella, stated that he believed Schroeder was trying to flee when shot. \\"Bill was 332 feet away from the nearest National Guardsman, not much of a threat. He was shot with a folder in his hand.\\" Official reports stated that Schroeder was actually 382 feet from the National Guard at the time he was shot, while lying on the ground facing away from the Guardsmen. The bullet entered his left chest at the seventh rib, piercing his left lung, and some fragments exited from the top of his left shoulder. He died almost an hour later while in a hospital undergoing surgery. Sandra Scheuer was shot in the neck and also died. Two other students were killed in the shootings: Allison Krause and Jeffrey Miller. The shootings led to protests and a national student strike, causing hundreds of campuses to close because of both violent and non-violent demonstrations. The Kent State campus remained closed for six weeks. Five days after the shootings, 100,000 people demonstrated in Washington, D.C. against the war.

Shell description Triplofusus papillosus at the National Museum (Prague) This species shell length can reach 24 inches (60 cm). The outline of the shell is somewhat fusiform, with a long siphonal canal, and having up to 10 whorls. Its sculpture present several spiral cords and axial ribs, some of which can form knobs on the whorls' shoulders. The shell color is bright orange in very young individuals. The shell often becomes greyish white to salmon-orange when adult, with a light tan or dark brown periostracum. Ecology A horse conch feeding on the queen conch, Lobatus gigas, in Dry Tortugas National Park, Florida =Habitat= This species dwells on sand, weed and mud flats from the low intertidal to shallow subtidal zones, in 20 foot (6 m) deep water. =Feeding habits= Triplofusus papillosus is a carnivorous predatory species, and feeds on other large marine gastropods, including the tulip shell (Fasciolaria tulipa), the lightning whelk (Sinistrofulgur perversum), and the queen conch (Lobatus gigas) as well as some Murex species.Wells F.

The Marine Flora and Fauna of Dampier, Western Australia. Western Australian Museum, Perth. It may also present cannibalistic behaviour, feeding on smaller conspecific individuals. It has been observed (in an aquarium setting) to eat small hermit crabs of the species Clibanarius vittatus. =Parasites= Parasites of Triplofusus papillosus include trematode Lophotaspis vallei. Human useModern times= The U.S. state of Florida declared it the state seashell in 1969. The shell is popular with shell collectors partly because of its great size. =Archaeological and anthropological uses= In classic Mayan art, the Horse Conch is shown being utilised in many ways including as paint and ink holders for elite scribes, and also as a bugle or trumpet. In southern Florida, Native Americans, including the Calusa and Tequesta, used the horse conch to make several types of artifact. The whole shell, or more commonly only the columella, was attached to a wooden handle and used as a hammer or woodworking tool. The body whorl was used as a drinking cup. The columella was also used to make plummets or sinkers. References * Rosenberg, G. 1992. Encyclopedia of Seashells. Dorset: New York. 224 pp. page(s): 91 * Rosenberg, G., F. Moretzsohn, and E. F.

The area, particularly east of Springfield Boulevard, is sometimes also referred to as Brookville. History The area was first settled by Europeans in 1660, and was subsequently farmed until the mid nineteenth-century. Major residential development came in the 1920s as Long Island Rail Road service was expanded to the area at the Springfield Gardens station (closed in 1979). Between 1920 and 1930 the population increased from 3,046 to 13,089, with a lot of the newcomers being people from Brooklyn seeking out suburban homes. In 1927, the name of the community was changed to the more elegant Springfield Gardens. Farmers Boulevard, Merrick Boulevard, Springfield Boulevard, Rockaway Boulevard, and Guy R. Brewer Boulevard all are major streets in the area. Today the area maintains its low-rise suburban nature. It is home to majority Afro-Caribbean and Indo-Caribbean populations including immigrants from Jamaica, Trinidad, Haiti and Guyana. Many homes have been torn down and remade for more families as more people move into the neighborhood. Part is in a Registered historic District.

Eisentrager, 339 U.S. 763 (1950), was a major decision of the US Supreme Court, where it decided that US courts had no jurisdiction over German war criminals held in a US-administered prison in Germany. The prisoners had at no time been on American sovereign territory. This decision was weakened by the Court's ruling in Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court (1973), when the court found that the key to jurisdiction was whether the Court could process service to the custodians. Braden was relied on by the Court in Rasul v. Bush (2004), in which it held that it did have jurisdiction over the detainees held at Guantanamo Bay detention camp because it could reach their custodians, the policymakers and leaders of the Bush administration, who were responsible for their detention.  Facts  On May 8, 1945, the German High Command executed an act of unconditional surrender, expressly obligating all forces under German control at once to cease active hostilities and therefore ending the European Theater of World War II. The prisoners had been convicted in China by an American military commission of violating the laws of war, by engaging in, permitting, or ordering continued military activity against the United States after surrender of Germany and before surrender of Japan. They were transported to the American-occupied part of Germany and imprisoned there in the custody of the US Army. Claiming that their trial, conviction, and imprisonment violated Articles I and Article III, the Fifth Amendment, and other provisions of the US Constitution, laws of the United States, and provisions of the Geneva Conventions, they petitioned the District Court for the District of Columbia for a writ of habeas corpus directed to the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Army, and several officers of the Army having directive power over their custodian. The US government argued: # A non- resident enemy alien has no access to US courts during wartime. # The non- resident enemy aliens, captured and imprisoned abroad, have no right to a writ of habeas corpus in a court of the United States. (See Ex parte Quirin) # The Constitution does not confer a right of personal security or immunity from military trial and punishment upon an alien enemy engaged in the hostile service of a government at war with the United States.

He matriculated in 1898, taking a first Classical Moderations in 1900 and a graduating with a second in Greats in 1902. After failing to get into the Indian Civil Service and the medical examination for the Royal Navy, he came a lowly 15th in the Inland Revenue entrance exams in 1903. Sixteen years later he was Permanent Secretary to the Treasury and the first-ever Head of the Home Civil Service. Fisher has been described as one of the most influential British civil servants of his generation Hennessy, 1992, p.225 Fisher gave the Civil Service a cohesion it previously lacked and did more to reform it than any man in the preceding fifty years. He increased the importance of the Treasury. He advanced the interests of women in the civil service and at one point described himself as a feminist. However, he was also a controversial figure: his colleague Maurice Hankey, with whom he sometimes co-operated and sometimes competed on issues of imperial defence policy, once described him as 'rather mad', and he was criticised for his attempts to control the appointments of senior civil servants across Whitehall. Christopher Bullock was one example. His generally unsuccessful attempts to gain a say in Foreign Office appointments were much resented, and gave rise to unfounded accusations that he had been an appeaser (despite a robust defence of his reputation by the arch-antiappeaser Robert Vansittart). He married Mary Ann Lucie (Maysie) Thomas on 24 April 1906 and had two sons, but the marriage ended in separation in 1921. He died in London a few days after his 69th birthday. Sir Noel Curtis-Bennett eulogised him in a letter to The Times: His elder son Norman Fisher (d. 1982) made his career in the Royal Navy, surviving two submarine disasters before the war and attaining the rank of captain; his second son Robin died in 1988.

The incident occurred off the coast of San Diego after a routine training mission.Stamford, Lincs., UK: Air Forces Monthly, compiled by Dave Allport, January 1995, Number 82, pages 58–59. Finding herself overshooting the landing area centerline, Hultgreen attempted to correct her approach by applying left rudder pedal, which caused the nose to disrupt the airflow over the left (inside) wing, as well as the airflow to the left engine intake. The port engine suffered a compressor stall and lost power—a well-known deficiency characteristic of the F-14A's TF30-P-414A engine when inlet air is no longer flowing straight into it. For this reason, the F-14 NATOPS flight manual warned against excess yaw. Loss of an F-14 engine results in asymmetric thrust, which can exceed rudder authority, especially at low speeds. After aborting the approach, Hultgreen selected full afterburner on the remaining engine, causing an even greater asymmetry. This, combined with a high angle of attack, caused an unrecoverable approach turn stall and rapid wing drop to the left. The radar intercept officer in the rear seat, Lt. Matthew Klemish, initiated ejection for himself and Hultgreen as soon as it was apparent the aircraft was becoming uncontrollable. First in the automated ejection sequence, the RIO survived. However, by the time Hultgreen's seat fired 0.4 seconds later, the plane had exceeded 90 degrees of roll, and she was ejected downward into the water, killing her instantly. On 12 November, 19 days after the crash, the Navy salvaged the plane and recovered Hultgreen's body, still strapped into the ejection seat, from a depth of . On 21 November, she was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, with full military honors. The F-14A lost in the crash, BuNo 160390, had been one of the two involved in the Gulf of Sidra incident of 1981, when it was previously assigned to Fighter Squadron 41 (VF-41) at NAS Oceana, Virginia, and embarked with Carrier Air Wing Eight (CVW-8) aboard . As with most approaches to a carrier landing, Hultgreen's incident was videotaped by two cameras. The tape shows an overshooting turn onto final, then apparent engine failure, followed by an audible wave-off and gear-up command from the landing signal officer. Segments shown on broadcast television concluded with the rapid sequence of aircraft stall, roll, crew ejections, and impact with the water. Controversy Elaine Donnelly of the Center for Military Readiness, suggested that Hultgreen \\"may have been the victim of a flawed policy,\\" a policy that overlooked her mistakes in training, two of which were similar to those that caused her death. The other pilot named by the center subsequently brought a suit for defamation against the CMR but lost because the court determined that, by virtue of her status as one of the first women to attempt to qualify as a carrier combat pilot, she was a \\"public figure\\" and had to prove malice on the part of those who published the charge of favoritism. She appealed but her appeal was denied with a statement that \\"Our conclusion about Lt. Lohrenz's public figure status does not suggest that she was not a good Naval aviator trying to do her job, and it does not penalize her for acting with 'professionalism.'\\" An Accuracy in Media article quotes CDR Tom Sobiek, commanding officer of Fighter Squadron VF-124, as saying of the four female pilots in his squadron, \\"The women are going to graduate regardless of how they performed\\" and \\"the Navy was in a race with the Air Force to get the first female fighter pilot\\". It quotes Sobiek denying making any such statement. \\"That is a flat **** lie,\\" he said. \\"And whoever told you that, if they were under oath, should be taken to task.\\" Several of the instructors, however, testified to the contrary. During a subsequent interview with Mike Wallace of CBS \\"60 Minutes,\\" Sobiek finally admitted that he had made statements that may have conveyed the impression that the women would not be allowed to fail. He added that some female pilots were advanced in combat aviation ahead of many men who were kept waiting or forced to resign.

He was a bishop who never ruled his see, even though he was appointed to two of them: Bishop of Ross, Ireland in 1482 and Bishop of Cork and Cloyne in 1490. His feast day is 25 October.  Early life  Mac Cárthaigh was born in 1455 almost certainly at Innishannon, Co. Cork. His father was the lord of Muskerry and his mother was reputedly the daughter of Edmund Fitzmaurice, ninth Lord of Kerry. It is probably the case that he belonged to the sept of the MacCarthy Reagh of Carbery.O'Callaghan, Arthur. \\"Blessed Thaddeus McCarthy\\", Diocese of Cork and Ross Laurence Rehenan, Professor of Ecclesiastical History of Maynooth College, suggests that he was educated by the Franciscan Friars of Timoleague. Mac Cárthaigh studied for the priesthood under an uncle, Canon Thady Mac Cárthaigh and continued his studies in Paris with another relative, Professor Don Raymond, at Paris University. He was ordained in Cork by Bishop William Roche and travelled to Rome afterwards to continue his studies. It would appear that Thaddeus, prior to nomination to Ross, occupied a position in one of the Roman tribunals. Bishop of Ross  While in Rome, his many qualities made a deep impression and although only 27 years old, Pope Sixtus IV appointed him as Bishop of Ross in Cork, which see had become vacant upon the death of Bishop Donald. On 3 May 1482 Mac Cárthaigh was consecrated archbishop by in the Church of Santo Stefano del Cacco in Rome by Stephen Teglatius (or de Taleazis), Archbishop of Antivari (the modern Bar), assisted by Daniel, Bishop of Rhosus in Cilicia, and by Julianus de Matheis (or de Maffei de Vulterris), Bishop of Bertinori. When he returned to Munster Mac Cárthaigh discovered that the see was already in the possession of Hugh O'Driscoll, who had been appointed to the see in 1473 by the same Pope Sixtus. At this stage in Irish history there was no single political entity. There were Gaelic kings and Anglo lords. It may have happened that news had reached Rome of the death of Bishop Hugh either innocently or through political intrigue. A lengthy dispute broke out between the Mac Cárthaigh and O'Driscoll dynasties over who was the rightful bishop of Ross, during which the O'Driscolls made many false accusations against Mac Cárthaigh. Bishop O'Driscoll assumed Thaddeus was an imposter and complained to Rome. In 1485, Henry VII became king of England, Ireland, and his party wanted to have its own representative as bishop of Ross. Mac Cárthaigh was declared an intruder and excommunicated. In 1488 Pope Innocent VIII confirmed the excommunication, at which time Mac Cárthaigh appealed the decision and a commission was set up. The commission found in his favour, and the excommunication was nullified. He was then appointed Bishop of Cork and Cloyne on 21 April 1490.  Bishop of Cork and Cloyne  Mosaic in the Chapel of Blessed Thaddeus McCarthy, Cobh Cathedral. Returning to Munster, Mac Cárthaigh found that Gerald FitzGerald had usurped the Diocese of Cork and Cloyne with support from local rulers. Opponents of the Mac Cárthaigh dynasty included the corporation of the City of Cork, and the Earl of Desmond. Gerald Fitzgerald had the backing of leading landowners in the county. Armed men took possession of the cathedral preventing Mac Cárthaigh from entering. For two years, he travelled from town to village armed with the papal documents announcing his rightful appointment and absolution from any criminal charge. Having opposed any retaliation by his own lineage, they too abandoned him. Without dynastic support, status or security, Mac Cárthaigh once again set off for Rome to plead his case to the Pope. Pope Innocent XIII gave him another document dated 18 July 1492. It ordered that Gerald, Earl of Kildare, at that time, one of the most powerful figures in Ireland, should, with his army, protect and restore Mac Cárthaigh to his rightful place as Bishop of Cork and Cloyne. Fearing danger to his life from his enemies, Mac Cárthaigh set out for Ireland as a pilgrim.Stevens, Clifford. The One Year Book of Saints, Our Sunday Visitor Publishing Division, Our Sunday Visitor, Inc., Huntington, Indiana Death Fourteen weeks later, Mac Cárthaigh arrived at Ivrea having presumably walked from Rome. On the evening of 24 October 1492, a lone pilgrim arrived on foot at the hostel for pilgrims. Dressed in a coarse habit and hood and wearing the oyster shell emblem that ensured safe passage, he appeared to be very weak and worn out by fatigue. The warden of the hostel gave the exhausted traveler a hospitable welcome and a place to rest for the night. At dawn, a strange and mysterious light was observed coming from his room. On entering, the warden discovered the body of the pilgrim illuminated by a beautiful radiance of light. Tadhg Mac Cárthaigh was 37 years old. Mac Cárthaigh would have been buried in a pauper's grave but the Bishop Nicholas Garigliatti was summoned. The bishop is said to have had an extraordinary dream during the night in which he had witnessed a man dressed in bishop's robes ascending in glory to heaven. He immediately recognised the dead man as the person he had seen in the dream. The man's belongings were examined - a wallet, a water container and a pilgrim staff were his sole possessions. However, the wallet contained some papal documents and a bishop's ring. Bishop Garigliatti ordered that the body be clothed in episcopal robes and brought to Ivrea Cathedral for solemn lying in state before burial within the cathedral. When news of the death of bishop Mac Cárthaigh traveling in disguise spread, crowds flocked to the cathedral of Ivrea for his funeral. He was buried in the Ivrea cathedral and many miracles have been attributed to him there. Veneration Altar with the funeral urn of Blessed Tadhg Mac Cárthaigh, Cathedral of Ivrea His tomb became a local shrine. In 1742, when his tomb was opened, the body was found to be perfectly preserved. During the great famine in 1847, the clergy and people of Ivrea donated a substantial sum of money for the relief of the Irish Famine victims. They also requested any information on Mac Cárthaigh, principally because of the veneration of the people of Ivrea and the many miracles attributed to his intercession. This request aroused great interest in Mac Cárthaigh and, after a long investigation into his life, it was decided to seek his beatification on behalf of the people and clergy of Ivrea and Cork.\\"Blessed Thaddeus McCarthy\\", Cathedral of St. Mary and St. Anne, Cork In 1896 Pope Leo XIII confirmed the immemorial cult of the \\"Blessed Thaddeus\\". The same year (1896) clerics in Ivrea agreed to donate major relics of Mac Cárthaigh to the dioceses of Cork & Ross and Cloyne. These relics can now be found in The Church of The Immaculate Conception The Lough, Cork North Cathedral, Cobh Cathedral and St Mary's Parish Church in Youghal. His feast day of 25 October is kept in the dioceses of Ross, Cork, and Cloyne, and in Ivrea, where he was buried. Mac Cárthaigh was honoured with the title of \\"White Martyr of Munster\\" principally because of the intense mental and physical anguish. References Bibliography  *L.

Since 1997 he has been a member of the House of Lords as a life peer. Early life Lord James Douglas-Hamilton was born to the 14th Duke of Hamilton and the former Lady Elizabeth Percy. He was educated at Eton and Balliol College, Oxford where he was president of the Oxford Union, and thereafter at the University of Edinburgh. Political career He served as an advocate and an interim Procurator Fiscal Depute from 1968 to 1972. From 1972 to 1974, he was a councillor on Edinburgh District Council, and after unsuccessfully contesting Hamilton in February 1974, from October 1974 to 1997 he was Member of Parliament for Edinburgh West. During this time he served in the Scottish Office. In the years between 1987 and 1995 he served as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, and thereafter as Minister of State between 1995 and 1997.

Peerage In 1994 on the death of George Nigel Douglas-Hamilton, 10th Earl of Selkirk, Selkirk inherited the earldom, although the succession was disputed, as Alasdair Douglas-Hamilton, a nephew of the 10th Earl, claimed it, ultimately without success. Due to the terms of the Peerage Act 1963, Selkirk was considered to be unable to vote in the House of Commons until he had disclaimed the title, even though the succession to it had not been decided. As the Conservative government of the day had a small majority, he felt obliged to disclaim immediately. After losing his seat in the 1997 general election, he was elevated to the House of Lords as a life peer, being created Baron Selkirk of Douglas, of Cramond in the City of Edinburgh. Scottish Parliament From 1999 to 2007 he was a member of the Scottish Parliament and was deputy Convener of its Education Committee. In November 2005, Lord Selkirk of Douglas announced his intention to retire at the end of the 2003-2007 session of the Scottish Parliament.

Books Lord Selkirk of Douglas has written a number of books, including Motive For a Mission: The Story Behind Hess's Flight to Britain about his father's meeting with Rudolf Hess when he landed in Scotland during World War II. Family In 1974 he married the Hon. (Priscilla) Susan Buchan, a granddaughter of the politician and novelist John Buchan, and daughter of Lord Tweedsmuir and Lady Tweedsmuir. They have four sons of whom the eldest, John Andrew Douglas-Hamilton, Lord Daer and Master of Selkirk (b 1978) is heir apparent to the disclaimed Earldom of Selkirk.
