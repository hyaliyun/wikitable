American Lutheranism, Volume I St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House. 1919, p. 31.) was a German Lutheran minister who led German emigrants to New York. Biography Joshua Harrsch was born at Fachsenfeld in Aalen, in the Ostw√ºrttemberg region of Baden-W√ºrttemberg. He was the youngest of 23 children of Hans J√∂rg Harrsch (1610-1675). Educated to the ministry, he served as a Lutheran pastor at Landau in Palatinate. The Palatinate in Germany had been ravaged by the Thirty Years' War (1618 and 1648) and the subsequent Nine Years' War (1688‚Äì97). Refugees from the war, occupation by the French army and the unpopular political and religious policies of Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine sought a new life elsewhere. Harrsch became the leader of a group of these Palatines and traveled to London to secure permission for them to settle under the British crown. Queen Anne supported Protestantism as did her Lutheran husband, Prince George of Denmark.Bente, F. American Lutheranism, Volume I St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House. 1919, p. 29. The first group, which arrived in New York during 1708, consisted of 53 persons. Unjustly deprived of food, a portion of his congregation settled for a time in the Mohawk Valley. Harrsch sailed back to return with a second group, which arrived in June 1710. Although he left with 3,000 persons, 800 of them died on the way or shortly afterward while in quarantine. Many of them first were assigned to work camps along the Hudson River to work off their passage. Newly arrived Palatines were settled in the West Camp, (Saugerties) near the mouth of the Esopus Creek. Others were settled across the river in the East Camp on the east side of the Hudson River. Reverend Josua Harrsch was the Lutheran minister on both sides of the river.Bente, F. American Lutheranism, Volume I St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House. 1919, p. 30. He died in Ulster County. Upon his death, he was succeeded by Justus Falckner, the first Lutheran minister to have been ordained in America.Bente, F.

The earth dam and its reservoir serve for flood control and recreational purposes. It lies upstream (southeast) from the city of Orange and north of Irvine. Irvine Lake is the largest body of fresh water entirely in Orange County. History Construction on the dam started in 1929 with a joint venture by the Irvine Company and Serrano Irrigation District. After the site was graded, the dam was built using dirt and rock excavated from the sides of the canyon and from the streambed both above and below the dam site. The structure was completed in 1931 at a cost of $1 million, and its reservoir, Irvine Lake, filled by 1933. In the late 1930s, the lake was stocked with fish, and was opened to the public for recreational use in 1941. The dam was built to serve the purpose of flood control, irrigation and municipal water use. With heavy suburban sprawl downstream encroaching since the 1960s, agriculture along lower Santiago Creek has practically ceased. It is currently owned by the Irvine Ranch Water District and the Serrano Water District (the former Serrano Irrigation District). Today the dam marks the usual ending point of surface flow in Santiago Creek, as all the discharge is retained in the reservoir and downstream flow is limited to seepage and stormwater. Statistics The Santiago Dam is a roller compacted earth and rockfill structure high and long. It is roughly wide at the base and contains some of material. The dam's spillway is a concrete overflow structure to the left side, equipped with nine openings each wide and high, able to pass a flow exceeding . This spillway has only been used a few times, such as the floods of 1938, 1969, 1983, 1998 and 2005. The dam crest is above sea level. Irvine Lake is the reservoir formed behind the dam, and has a normal storage of at elevation. Maximum storage is in the event of a flood. This reservoir is not only the largest man-made lake in Orange County, but is also the largest body of fresh water entirely in the county. The lake covers about and is stocked with several species of fish. A fishing license is not required. The dam and reservoir receive water from a catchment area totaling , controlling water from about two-thirds of the Santiago Creek watershed. Santiago Dam is designed to contain up to a 50-year flood and withstand a 500-year flood of over . Aside from Santiago Creek, Limestone Wash and various unnamed streams flow into the reservoir. Upstream tributaries of Santiago Creek include Silverado and Modjeska Creeks. The dam operates in conjunction with the downstream Villa Park Dam, which can store up to .

Haley (1963) Space Law and Government, Appleton Century Crofts, New YorkErnst Fasan (1970) Relations with Alien Intelligences: The Scientific Basis of Metalaw, Berlin Verlag, Berlin In 1928, Haley earned his LLB from Georgetown University Law School and later earned a BA from George Washington University. In the early days of jet-assisted takeoff (JATO), engineers including Theodore von K√°rm√°n decided to form Aerojet Corporation to provide a business structure to their activities. When von K√°rm√°n called on Haley in 1942 to help with the incorporation, Haley said he was busy with a case before the Federal Power Commission. In a gesture of quid pro quo, von K√°rm√°n's team provided evidence to win Haley's case before the Commission, and Haley went to California to draw up the articles of incorporation.Theodore von K√°rm√°n (1967) The Wind and Beyond When financing from the Air Force was interrupted, General Benjamin Chidlaw told K√°rm√°n, \\"Find somebody who knows something about doing business with Washington and send him here.\\" Haley's knowledge of the business and legal training made him the man for the job. But he was in uniform at Military Affairs Division of Judge Advocate General's Corps, U.S. Air Force. Theodore worked his way up the chain of command to General Arnold who dismissed Haley for civilian duty at Aerojet. :Haley became Areojet's second president on August 26, 1942. He proved to be an incredible administrator. He held the company together by guts and audacity. On occasion he even sent handwritten letters to the Navy for advances to meet payrolls. Aerojet expanded quickly, but needed capital, so Haley contacted William F. O'Niel, president of General Tire and his vice-president Dan A. Kimball. A line of credit was offered and in January 1945 General Tire bought half the stock of Aerojet. General Tire pressured the remaining shareholders, including Haley and K√°rm√°n, to sell, which they did in 1953. :Andy Haley left Aerojet to become counsel for a U. S. Senate committee that was investigating the economic future of the aerospace industry. Later, he went back to the practice of radio law. He never lost his love of rocketry, however, and today he is a leading figure in the International Astronautical Federation ‚Ä¶ and widely known as the nation's first \\"space lawyer\\", having devoted himself, among other things, to setting up guidelines for prospective claims to the moon. In 1963 Appleton-Century-Crofts published Haley's Space Law and Government. Lyndon Johnson (then Vice President), Carl Albert and George P. Miller contributed forewords to the book. Haley acknowledged the \\"analytical capacity of Mr. Crane and his unexcelled ability to quickly assemble source material\\"(page xv). The chapters considered the promise and challenge of space, traditional bases of international law, national consent to overflight, limits of national sovereignty, sovereignty over celestial bodies, space vehicle regulations, space communications, liability for personal and property damages, space medical jurisprudence, intergovernmental organizations, and non-governmental organizations. Reviews were published by Alan V. Washburn in American Journal of Legal History and Carol Q. Christol in Southern California Law Review (both in 1964), by Stephen E. Doyle in Duke Law Journal (1965) and by L.F.E. Goldie in Georgetown Law Journal (1966). In his 1967 autobiography, K√°rm√°n tells of his trip to Moscow where he met with Ivan Bardin. At the time he was unaware of early rocketry in Russia, and only by Haley's graces later was he brought up to speed: :My friend, space lawyer Andrew G. Haley, who likes to explore historical questions as a hobby, later told me that it is likely that the Russians ‚Äì and not the Germans as is popularly supposed ‚Äì founded the first rocket society in the world. At least Moscow had an interplanetary travel group as early as 1924, and three years later, at the time the Germans founded their first rocket society, the Russians were hosts to the first International Exhibition of Space Navigation. In 1928 and during the following four years Professor Nikolai Rynin published a formidable nine- volume encyclopedia entitled Interplanetary Communications. It was the first authoritative summary of man's knowledge of space travel. Haley, along with his friend and colleague Ernst Fasan, was instrumental in founding both the International Academy of Astronautics and the International Institute of Space Law. Haley died in 1966.

He was born in Quebec, and described himself as \\"Scots-Canadian\\". He briefly contributed to the Pall Mall Gazette, and then for several years he worked with the Daily Mail as traveling correspondent in the Far East. Mackenzie was one of the few Western journalists to cover the Russo-Japanese War from the Japanese side, and one of the few Western correspondents that wrote about the Korean resistance against Japan during the Japanese Rule. His last book was related to religious persecution in Soviet Russia. In 2014, he was posthumously awarded the Order of Merit for National Foundation by the Korean Government.  Career  = Russo-Japanese War = As a war correspondent for the Daily Mail, Frederick A. MacKenzie registered the Russo-Japanese War. During these years, he traveled to Korea and Manchuria with American writers Jack London and Robert L. Dunn. They were the only Western journalists witnessing the early stages of the conflict in the side of the Japanese army. MacKenzie exalted the Japanese soldiers that fought in the war. He praised their education and observed the soft treatment given to captured Russian officers. He also remarked about the ability of Japanese soldiers to stand prolonged exertion. = Covering Korean Resistance = Korean Rebels of the Rigtheous Army. Photo taken by F. A. MacKenzie. MacKenzie returned back to England after the Russo-Japanese War, but he visited Korea again to cover the Japanese intervention in the peninsula. He stayed in the Korean Empire for almost two years, from the summer of 1906 to the end of 1907. During that time, he wrote about King Sunjong‚Äôs coronation ceremony in July 1907, the righteous armies, and British journalist Ernest Thomas Bethell‚Äôs deportation. Frederick MacKenzie eyewitnessed the abuse of Japanese forces on his way to Icheon, despite Japan¬¥s attempts to obstruct the work of foreign journalists. He went to Chungju, Chungcheongbuk-do Province, where he met the righteous army soldiers in person. MacKenzie took the only remaining photos of the righteous armies of Korea. He described their integrants as an example of what patriotism was, with \\"sparkling eyes and smiles\\". In 1908, MacKenzie published The Tragedy of Korea, a book that accounts for the events that led to the destruction of the Korean Empire and the posterior Japanese rule on Korea. In 1919, MacKenzie wrote another book about Korea's resistance against the Japanese rule: Korea's Fight For Freedom. In the book, he accounted for the spirit of independence of the Koreans in the March 1st Movement. In their writings, MacKenzie described with details the torture methods of Japanese, and he emphasized that the March 1st Movement was \\"a demonstration, not a riot\\", but Japanese police responded using their swords freely. In 2014, the Korean Government awarded MacKenzie posthumously with the grade of Order of Independence, Order of Merit for National Foundation. = Religious Persecution in Russia = In 1930, MacKenzie published a book about religious persecution during the Bolshevism in Russia. In the preface of the book, he pointed out that the book was \\"a record, a protest, and an appeal\\". The book is mainly based on the personal experiences of the author, who was in the Soviet State from 1921 until 1924. After that, he was established in Stockholm and he visited frequently Finland, Estonia, and Latvia, trying to keep in touch with the Russian situation. As the Daily Mail took a strong position against Bolshevism in Russia, MacKenzie preferred not to be a correspondent of them for that research. Instead, he contacted with Edward Price Bell of the Chicago Daily News, and Lord Beaverbrook and R. D. Blurnfeld of the Daily Express. This partnership allows him to visit Moscow for the winter, and he stayed there for many years.  Anti-japanese accusations  After writing Tragedy of Korea, critics attacked MacKenzie as exaggerating facts. He was also signaled as \\"anti-japanese\\". He answered the critics saying: No man has written more appreciatively of certain phases of Japanese character and accomplishments than myself. My personal relations with the Japanese, more especially with the Japanese Army, left me with no sense of personal grievance but with many pleasant and cordial memories.

He was initially trained in western painting, but in the post- World War II independence period, he initiated a revival of Traditional painting, borrowing from the Western training he had received as well as his own cultural heritage of painting styles and techniques. Early life Ba Kyi was born on 16 July 1912 in Kyaikhto, and took up painting at an early age. He attended Rangoon University where he gained an Intermediate of Science and a Teachers Certificate. Beginning in 1933, he apprenticed under the master Ba Nyan, who had studied western oil painting in London, England and who painted in a realist and naturalist style. His fellow students studying with Ba Nyan included Bogalay Kyaw Hlaing, Aye Maung and Thein Han (painter). In 1939, when the State School of Art and Music opened, Ba Kyi became an art instructor there. Under the Japanese occupation during World War II, he was an art lecturer at the Institute of Art, which was organized by the Japanese. He designed currency notes, stamps and propaganda posters. After Myanmar regained independence, he painted huge theatre backdrops and drew many magazine covers and illustrations. Studies overseas In 1949, he won a French government scholarship to the √âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where he studied for one year. He was able to exhibit two of his works in Paris at 162e Exposition, Societe des artists francais, Salon 1949, and also in art shows in London and Monte Carlo. On his return, he was commissioned to illustrate the History of the Buddha compiled by Agga Maha Pandita Ashin Zanakabhivamsa, which he executed in watercolor in the Traditional Burmese painting style while adding considerable innovation. In 1958, the United States government awarded him a scholarship to study for a year at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia. During this time, he also attended the University of Pennsylvania School of Fine Arts in a program aimed towards earning an M.A., but he returned to Burma early and did not earn his M.A. there. As he is quoted often in Burma as possessing an M.A., including on his own resume, it seems that the M.A. was awarded to him by the Burmese government or some educational institution in Burma upon his return to Burma. Break from Ba Nyan Ba Kyi was an early follower of the modern school of painting in Myanmar first established by Ba Nyan, but he gradually broke from Ba Nyan and began exploring Burmese Traditional culture and painting techniques. One interesting aspect about Ba Kyi is that his transformation from a Western-style realist and naturalist to a Traditional revivalist did not follow an easily defined linear pattern. Ba Kyi jumped back and forth between Western-style work and his Traditional painting, while also mixing the two genres in unusual combinations throughout his life. For example, his watercolor paintings in the early 1950s on the History of the Buddha (above) are clearly some of the more Traditional paintings he ever executed. They are done in bold contrasts of color with the anatomy of figures outlined in thin black lines, with almost no sfumato, as was typical of Traditional painting, but he also introduced a greater sense of anatomical proportion, Western-style perspective, shading, and a sense of movement through fluidity of line which was not typical of figurative work in older Traditional painting. In the 1960s, more than a decade later, he did a number of Western-style works of a realist and impressionist character. His murals at Yangon Airport in 1956 are intensely Traditional in their content, but the techniques in the paintings are mostly Western. By the 1970s, however, it seems that most of his work was in the revived Traditional vein. Mural works Ba Kyi is known for his murals, including works on the walls of the library of the Yangon Institute of Education and two murals in the departure hall of Yangon Airport, depicting scenes from Myanmar legends. The paintings at Yangon Airport are thoroughly Burmese in content and tone, but were apparently influenced by his training in mural painting under Ba Nyan, who had encountered and spent some time studying the work of Frank Brangwyn, the British muralist, in London. Ba Nyan's one large mural in Burma was destroyed during World War II and pictures of it do not survive, so it is impossible to use it as a source of comparison with Ba Kyi's work. However, there is considerable similarity between the style of Ba Kyi's mural painting and that of Brangwyn in the muscular depiction of figures. Ba Kyi also created mural paintings depicting important events in the Buddha‚Äôs life in the two-storied Ordination Hall at Myanmar Buddhist Vihara, Bodh Gaya, Bihar, India. The paintings he made for Yangon's Strand Hotel show a humorous eye for the lighter side of Burmese character. Outside Myanmar, his works are on display in the Tashkent Museum, the Beijing National Museum, the Tropical Museum Amsterdam, and the Bodhgaya Museum in India. According to his resume, his works are also in the Sukarno Collection in Indonesia and the Collection of the King of Thailand. Critical observation Min Naing, the art historian and painter who was a student of Ba Kyi, said of his work: \\"Ba Kyi has masterly control of lines and colour and with a few strokes of pencil or brush he makes a picture come alive. His lines are bold and his colours are lively and he can with his art convey his theme with great clarity. But his technique is purely Myanmar, so the configuration of his pictures tends to be graceful and elegant. No other artist excels him in Composition and Rhythm\\". Synopsis of his popular appeal Ba Kyi was a simple and unassuming man, who led a quiet life. He lived in a rather large house in a prominent warren of Yangon, and it may be said that he was financially solvent and successful as an artist. A number of his paintings were given to foreign dignitaries as gifts of state, and in this respect he served as a kind of \\"ambassador\\" of the arts for Burma, regardless of regime, democratic or military, for his Traditional- style works had broad appeal across the Burmese spectrum. Other of his paintings hung conspicuously in hotels or venues such as university or public libraries, where Burmese could easily see them. His Neo-Traditional revival of Burmese painting arrived at a time when the Burmese, free of colonialism, were in sore need of reaffirming their national pride and zeitgeist. His works often expressed a broad, and even bawdy, sense of humor, much appreciated by ordinary Burmese but sometimes criticized by intellectuals if the subject of his painting was considered too serious for humor. His cartoon drawings for children books and magazines were very famous in the 70s. He taught Burmese history and Buddha life through his drawings to young and old. Ba Kyi became a lecturer at the Yangon Institute of Education, teaching there until his retirement in 1974. It is said that he was well loved and respected by his students and was often sympathetic to their demands for change of government. He died on 15 April 2000 at the age of 88.

In 2009, an amendment was proposed (which has not yet been enacted) as widespread protests forced the president to send the bill back to parliament for review. The bill sought to increase women's rights in the country, but was still opposed by some women. The bill was condemned by most religious scholars. It was passed in 2009, but withdrawn later the same year. Law In 1962, Mali passed its first Family Code. Proposed amendment The proposed amendment would have recognised only civil marriages, while defining marriage as a secular institution, thus entitling a divorcee to a share of inheritance. Women would have also been allowed greater inheritance rights than what was stipulated by Shariah law, as they would not be required to obey their husbands. The \\"paternal power\\" would be replaced with \\"parental authority,\\" and also said \\"no marriage can be renounced.\\" Furthermore, the bill raised the legal age for marriage to 18 and allowed divorce if a couple had lived apart for at least three years. A child born outside of marriage would also be entitled to a share of any inheritance. President Toumani Tour√© supported the bill, which was seen as a move toward secularism. The law was initially adopted by the National Assembly on August 3, 2009. =Advocacy= During the NGO Forum of the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights in Banjul, an African women's rights groups called for the adoption of the bill, saying it \\"provides some crucial guarantees for Malian women's universal rights, [and] would constitute a fundamental first step towards bringing Malian laws into compliance with international and regional standards.\\" The group cited Mali's ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women in 1985, the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa in 2005, and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1990. It further said: \\"We are thus deeply concerned that the enactment of this legislation...is in suspense. Violations of Malian women's human rights are favored by this legislative gap. We stress the urgent need to adopt such a code...by ensuring that the second reading takes place without further delay and that the Family Code is enacted in its present form, without weakening of any of its provisions.\\" =Controversy= Mamadou Diamout√©n√©, the head of a task group from the council, said that without the recommended changes, the bill would be \\"open road to debauchery. It is not that anyone can go wherever she wishes without her husband‚Äôs approval, because we cannot forget that the man is the head of the family.\\" Muslim leaders and other youth groups vowed to block the law and even threatened a campaign of violence. Threats against legislators, angry sermons, organised protest meetings and radio and television campaigns all attempted to rally opposition to the bill. Some Muslim leaders went so far as to call the law the work of the devil and against Islam. Tens of thousands marched in the streets to protest the law. In one such demonstration, 50,000 people rallied amidst calls that the bill was \\"an insult to the Koran.\\" Some women's groups were also opposed to the law. The president of the National Union of Muslim Women said that \\"only a tiny minority of woman here who want this new law. The poor and illiterate women of this country, the real Muslims, are against it\\". One imam who spoke in support of the code went into hiding. =Reactions= President Tour√© reasserted that the struggle to pursue \\"the dual objective of promoting a wave of modernization while preserving the foundations of our society\\" would continue. He also said that failures to update and enforce the law \\"proves that societal change is not ordered by decree. [The] door of debate is still open.\\" Mountaga Tall, an MP, said: \\"We demonstrated intellectual laziness in adopting the last code so quickly. This time, the assembly will start from zero.\\" Further amendments As a result of public outcry, President Tour√© sent the bill back to parliament on August 27, 2009. \\"I have taken this decision to send the family code for a second reading to ensure calm and a peaceful society, and to obtain the support and understanding of our fellow citizens.\\" An amended version, endorsed by the High Islamic Council, the highest authority on Islam in the country, was tabled. This new bill included the reintroduction of religious marriage, altered the previous version's enhancement of women's inheritance rights, and changed the recognition of an illegitimate child. Other amendments being proposed, despite being blocked in the initial version, include: *A husband and wife can keep separate homes only if the husband approves; *A divorc√©e may keep her ex-husband‚Äôs name if he agrees; *A girl would be allowed to get married at 15. However these three proposals have not been made a part of law, whereas religious marriage is still going to be maintained The debate over the bill included \\"civil society\\" groups in the first phase, and religious groups in the amendment phase.

He succeeded his grandfather in the viscountcy in May 1741, aged 14. As this was an Irish peerage it did not entitle him to a seat in the English House of Lords (although it did entitle him to a seat in the Irish House of Lords). He was consequently eligible for election to the House of Commons and in 1750 he was returned as one of two Knights of the Shire for Yorkshire, a seat he held until his death ten years later. Lord Downe also served in the Seven Years' War as a Lieutenant-Colonel in the 25th Foot. He fought in the Battle of Minden in 1759 and commanded the regiment in the Battle of Campen in October 1760.

It acts as both the secondary and tertiary care referral hospital for the Alaska Region of the Indian Health Service (IHS). Established in 1997, ANMC is jointly owned and managed by the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium and Southcentral Foundation as well as tribal governments, and their regional health organizations. The hospital is a 380,635 sq ft, 167-bed facility which opened in May 1997. It has a staff which includes over 250 physicians. ANMC is one of only two level II trauma centers in Alaska. The center is part of the Alaska Federal Health Care Access Network that provides telehealth services to 180 Alaska Native community village clinics. ANTHC opened a 202-bed patient housing facility connected by skybridge to ANMC on January 2, 2017. Ronald McDonald House occupies the 6th floor of patient housing for families and expectant mothers with high risk pregnancies. This is the first tribal partnership between Ronald McDonald House Charities and a tribal organization. ANMC had previously achieved magnet status but was unable to maintain it as of 2019. The largest hospital in United States Public Health Service history, the center was built with 168 million in federal funds secured by Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska after a thirty-year congressional battle. The design architects were assisted by a Native Alaskan design committee with the goal of integrating their traditional values, design esthetics, lifestyles, and environmental concerns into a state of the art hospital. This resulted in a modern facility with an atmosphere comfortable to Native Alaskans by using natural lighting, expansive views to the outside, traditional finishes and textures typical of Native Alaskans, as well as Native crafts and artwork displays. Construction was completed by a team of contractors and architects headed by Public Health Service professionals. Quyana Hospitality Services is a complimentary service available to patients. Services include assistance with Medicaid extensions, housing upon provider referral, and patient travel within the Anchorage service area or following patient medevac to ANMC upon provider referral. The old ANMC facility, built in 1953 as a tuberculosis sanitarium, was seriously damaged in the 1964 Alaska earthquake, and had been slated for replacement for many years. The five-year construction project for its relocation culminated on June 2, 1997, in a one-day move of all programs, patients and departments from the old facility in downtown Anchorage to the new building six miles away.

With Master Commandant John Porter in command, she joined the West Indies Squadron in early 1823 and almost immediately was dispatched to Puerto Rico to seek Puerto Rican aid in suppressing the pirates. Returning from this mission, Greyhound was placed under the command of Lieutenant Lawrence Kearny (1789-1868) and sent to patrol the coast of Cuba. While patrolling with the schooner on 21 July 1823, Greyhound gave chase to an unidentified ship off the Cuban coast near Vera Cruz; the ship turned out to be a legitimate Colombian privateer, a rare thing in those waters. Lieutenant Kearny then decided to go ashore in search of game to supplant his ship's food supply. His boat, when it neared the shore, was attacked from ambush and forced to return to Greyhound. When another attempt to land on 22 July 1823 met the same reception, Lieutenant Kearny sent ashore a party of United States Marines and U.S. Navy sailors under the command of Lieutenant David Glasgow Farragut (1801-1870), to attack the pirate camp. Meanwhile Greyhound and Beagle closed the shore and began to bombard the camp, effectively trapping the pirates between the landing party and the sea. After a brief but fierce struggle, the pirates, including some women and children, fled inland. Exploring the village, Farragut and his men discovered several large caves filled with rich plunder of all sorts. They burned the village and the eight small boats they found in the harbor, then returned to Greyhound and Beagle. Greyhound continued her coastal patrol duties until, with the onset of the yellow fever season later in 1823, the \\"Mosquito Fleet\\" sailed north for healthier weather. Greyhound did not return to the Caribbean with Porter in the spring of 1824. After a survey found her unfit for further service, the Navy sold her at Baltimore, Maryland, in 1824.

There was a petition against the result at Aldborough, but this had not been resolved by the time the Parliament was dissolved in 1715. While there was an outstanding petition against one of the elections, he was not required to choose which constituency he would represent, and so sat for both boroughs throughout the Parliament. He was returned for Pontefract at the 1715 general election until he was unseated on petition on 22 March 1716.

Ingredients Common ingredients are young unripe jackfruit, eggplant, chayote, melinjo beans and leaves, long beans, green chili pepper, tofu and tempeh, cooked in coconut milk and sometimes enriched with chicken or beef stock. The bumbu spice mixture includes ground chili pepper (optional, depending on the desired degree of spiciness), shallot, garlic, candlenut, coriander, kencur powder, turmeric powder (optional), dried shrimp paste, salt and sugar. There are two main variants of sayur lodeh soup based on its colour; the white and yellow lodeh. The greenish white sayur lodeh is made without turmeric, while the golden yellow one has turmeric in it. Sometimes green stink beans are added. The ingredients of sayur lodeh are similar to sayur asem, with the main difference in its liquid portion, sayur lodeh is coconut-milk based while sayur asem is tamarind based. To add aroma and taste, an authentic Javanese sayur lodeh recipe might include ground old tempeh. This old tempeh is known as \\"yesterday's tempeh\\" or \\"rotten tempeh\\" (). Origin The origin of the dish can be traced to the Javanese people's tradition of Java. According to Javanese Kejawen beliefs, sayur lodeh is an essential part of the slametan ceremony and it is believed as tolak bala, to ward off possible danger and disaster. The people and the Keraton (court) of Yogyakarta often communally cook sayur lodeh for the slametan ceremony. It is believed this can deter disasters such as wind storm, earthquake, volcanic eruption, drought and plague. It is well known in Javanese cuisine and has spread throughout Indonesia and the region. Because of Javanese migration to neighboring countries, today sayur lodeh is also popular in Malaysia and Singapore. Serving Golden sayur lodeh served in a buffet Sayur lodeh can be served with steamed rice (separated or mixed in one plate), or with sliced lontong rice cake. Although sayur lodeh basically is a vegetarian dish, it is popularly consumed with ikan asin (salted fish), opor ayam, empal gepuk or beef serundeng. Sambal terasi (\\"shrimp paste chili sauce\\") is usually served separately. In Malaysia and Singapore, when sayur lodeh is served with lontong (nasi himpit), it is known as lontong. Dried squid sambal, boiled egg and coconut serunding are often added to lontong.

It was published in New York in December 2001 by the Hispanic newspaper chain Hoy LLC, and boasts a cover designed by the Colombian artist Juan Arango. The story is framed within the so-called dirty realism of Latin America (led by the famous Cuban Pedro Juan Guti√©rrez). Spanish critic and poet Pablo Martinez Zarracina said in an article on Cuban literature published in El Norte de Castilla Lyrics that the book is considered to be an important work of this movement along with \\"Dirty Havana Trilogy\\" by Gutierrez. The author was interviewed on television both in the Big Apple and Miami, and several Hispanic newspapers (such as La Opini√≥n in Los Angeles) cited the book in their cultural pages. In June 2009, the Chilean journalist Pedro Scharwze published a story on \\"Last Rumba in Havana\\" on the occasion of its re-release in Spain by Editorial Baile del Sol Canary Islands, with a cover designed by the Cuban graphic artist Yailen Rivera based on an idea of Jesus Rivera's father who was a painter. The book was praised by authors as diverse as the Spanish novelist Antonio Mu√±oz Molina; the Cuban poet Ra√∫l Rivero; Cuban narrators Norberto Fuentes, Teresa Dovalpage, Felix Luis Viera and Antonio Ben√≠tez-Rojo; √âdouard Manet and the French Machover Jacob; and Spanish critic Mendoza Apuleius P√≠o Serrano. The Spanish researcher Beatriz Calvo said that along with works by Da√≠na Chaviano and Zo√© Vald√©s, \\"Last Rumba in Havana\\" was among the most outstanding books crafted by writers in exile on the situation of women in Cuba. Accolades continued, as the Mexican poet Ra√∫l Caballero published an article about the book in El Nuevo Herald of Miami, commenting that its title says it all and the work delivers a new aspect of Cuban literature. Plot The book chronicles the life of an architecture student turned prostitute. It portrays the reality of the notorious Cuban prostitutes who cater only to foreigners. The author delivers fragments of this life through a long monologue, starting with tales of sordid and violent episodes of childhood in the Havana neighborhood of Jesus Maria. With a nihilistic vision of Cuban society, he pursues his character's story both in the poor neighborhoods and those of high-ranking Cuban luxury hotels as well as prisons. It is a journey through the lost paradise that never officially existed. The dialogue is broken occasionally by insertions of short stories, poems, imaginary telephone conversations, proverbs and other resources, giving it a lyrical quality. Characters Throughout the text, the name of Dolphin is repeated, the first-love teen protagonist who was murdered. It also highlights Manca, a friend of main character John the Dead, who makes a brief appearance but is important because of the theme of child prostitution. As in John Dos Passos' novel entitled \\"Manhattan Transfer,\\" dozens of characters swarm in and out of the action like extras in a movie. But they are real characters, some intellectuals and some dissidents in Cuba. Theme The novel delves into the spirit of transgression, amorality, and the blooming of youth in an amoral society. The story unfolds over three days in the life of a Cuban prostitute and culminates with the scandalous uprising that took place in Havana in August 1994. The extraordinary sense of alienation, racism inherent in any dictatorship, lack of hope, and the irrational impulse to leave the country by any means, create an amazing atmosphere that culminates in an outburst of violence told by an anonymous and unnamed protagonist. Reception Although the book was greeted with silence in the Cuban community (especially in newspapers in Miami with Cuban influence), the reaction among Latin American intellectuals living in the U.S. was quite different. ABC Dominican, a literary magazine, interviewed the author. La Opinion of Los Angeles published a laudatory review, and other newspapers (including New York Today and The Dallas Star) reviewed the book. The author was also quoted on the digital page Rinconete, the Instituto Cervantes, as one of the new Cuban-born writers. In addition, the Madrid newspaper ABC published an article saying that the well-known writer Norberto Fuentes placed the author of \\"Last Rumba in Havana\\" among the most important writers in exile. With all of this support the book sold ten thousand copies, but a sector of the Cuban exile's community branded it as \\"pornographic.\\" Notes *Article was created based on a translation of the Spanish language Wikipedia article.

Background  The album was the last in a series of LPs recorded by Ben, under pressure from Philips to reproduce his widely successful 1963 debut Samba Esquema Novo. According to Brazilian music aficionado Greg Caz, \\"Jorge was hustled into the studio and obliged to crank out lesser versions of his debut classic, padded out with sometimes- questionable covers of tunes by other writers.\\" The liner notes for the album's 2008 reissue describe it as \\"a careful mix of originals and covers\\", abandoning the \\"groovy\\" and eclectic music of his live performances in favor of \\"nightclub-style arrangements\\" catering to samba and bossa nova audiences.  Release and aftermath  Big Ben was released by Philips in 1965. In the April 3 issue of Billboard that year, it was listed in the \\"international\\" category of four-star albums, indicating \\"new albums with sufficient commercial potential in their respective categories to merit being stocked by most dealers\\". Meanwhile, Ben's relationship with Philips reached a breaking point and the label terminated his contract, leaving him to work as an independent artist for the next few years. He was eventually re-signed by new management at Philips and released his self-titled sixth album for the label in 1969. Years later, music critic Tom Hull reflected on Big Ben, saying it \\"sees him experimenting with more straightforward rock rhythms, while continuing the success of the previous album.

He was involved in the Fasci Siciliani (Sicilian Leagues) a popular movement of democratic and socialist inspiration in 1891-1894, and became the first socialist mayor of Corleone in 1914. He was killed by the Mafia. Fasci Siciliani Verro was involved in the foundation of the Fascio dei lavoratori of Corleone on September 8, 1892. At the age of 26, Verro became its president. \\"Our Fascio has about six thousand members,\\" he told the journalist Adolfo Rossi, in an interview for La Tribuna from Rome in the autumn of 1893. \\"Our women have understood the advantages of union among the poor, and now teach their children socialism.\\" Verro, una vita contro la mafia, Citt√† Nuova di Corleone, November 3, 2004Rossi, L'agitazione in Sicilia. Verro's influence was not limited to Corleone. He was involved in setting up Fasci in neighbouring towns and mediated conflicts. Travelling by mule, he spread the message also in nearby towns.Dickie, Cosa Nostra, pp. 157-169 At the Congress of the Fasci in Palermo on May 21‚Äì22, 1893, Verro was elected a member of the new Central Committee. Il ¬´battesimo¬ª del socialismo, La Sicilia, May 24, 2009 In July 1893, he hosted a conference at Corleone that drafted model agrarian contracts for labourers, sharecroppers and tenants and presented them to the landowners. When those refused to negotiate a strike against landowners and against state taxes broke out over a large part of western Sicily. The so-called Patti di Corleone, are considered by historians to be the first trade union collective contract in capitalist Italy. La firma dei ¬´Patti di Corleone¬ª, La Sicilia, September 14, 2008 Involvement with the Mafia In the summer of 1893, Corleone became the strategic center of the peasant movement and the epicenter of the strike wave, thanks to Verro's charisma and to his hard-nosed choices, including a strategic alliance with a Mafia clan in Corleone and alliances with prominent Mafiosi in outlying towns, most notably Vito Cascioferro and Nunzio Giaimo in Bisacquino. The Mafiosi were sometimes needed to enforce flying pickets with credible threats of violence and to make the strike costly to landowners by destroying their property.Alcorn, Revolutionary Mafiosi. In order to give the strike teeth and to protect himself from harm, Verro became a member of a Mafia group in Corleone, the Fratuzzi (the Brothers). In a memoir written many years later, he described the initiation ritual he underwent in the spring of 1893: \\"[I] was invited to take part in a secret meeting of the Fratuzzi. I entered a mysterious room where there were many men armed with guns sitting around a table. In the center of the table there was a skull drawn on a piece of paper and a knife. In order to be admitted to the Fratuzzi, [I] had to undergo an initiation consisting of some trials of loyalty and the pricking of the lower lip with the tip of the knife: the blood from the wound soaked the skull.\\"Gambetta, The Sicilian Mafia, p. 263 However, during the great strike of the Fasci in September 1893, the Fratuzzi mobilized to boycott it, providing the necessary manpower to work on the lands that the peasants refused to cultivate. After that, Verro broke away from the mafiosi, and ‚Äì according to police reports ‚Äì became their most bitter enemy. Arrests and convictions Verro was arrested on January 16, 1894, after Prime Minister Francesco Crispi had ordered a crackdown on the Fasci. Together with other leaders of the Fasci Rosario Garibaldi Bosco, Nicola Barbato he tried to board the steamship Bagnara that was about to leave for Tunis. I Fasci dei lavoratori in Sicilia, by Pietro Siino, Societ√† Siciliana per l'Amicizia fra i Popoli On May 30, 1894, the leaders of the movement were convicted; Giuseppe de Felice Giuffrida was sentenced to 18 years in jail and Garibaldi Bosco, Barbato and Verro to 12 years.Sicilian Rioters Sentenced, The New York Times, May 31, 1894 Verro was also sentenced by another Military Tribunal to 16 years, a penalty of 500 lire and three years of special surveillance, for his alleged involvement with the Lercara Friddi massacre on Christmas 1893, despite the fact that he had not been present when the violence broke out and that in fact he had actually tried to calm down local hotheads in the days before. Le sette vittime del Natale 1893, La Sicilia, December 7, 2008 Natale 1893, la strage di Lercara, La Sicilia, December 31, 2010 After two years, in March 1896, he was released as the result of a pardon recognizing the excessive brutality of the repression.Bruno Cartosio, Sicilian Radicals in Two Worlds, in: Debouzy, In the Shadow of the Statue of Liberty, pp. 120-21 In June 1896, just released from prison by the amnesty, he formed a consumer cooperative, part of \\"La Terra\\" (The Earth), a federation bringing together all the farmers in the area of Corleone. But in September, the federation was dissolved by the prefect, because it was considered to be a surreptitious way to revive the Fasci. Verro was sentenced to six months' imprisonment and fined 100,000 lire for unlawful association. Convinced that in Sicily there was little space for political action, he decided to emigrate to the United States, to propagate socialism overseas.Disturbed By Anarchists, The New York Times, December 8, 1896 He only stayed two years and in the spring of 1898 he returned to Sicily, where he had to serve the six months in jail to which he had been sentenced. Verro e la ¬´guerra¬ª ai gabelloti, La Sicilia, October 22, 2006 Farmer cooperatives and agrarian strikes Once released, in January 1899 he established a consumer cooperative in Corleone involving some 800 heads of households that could buy basic necessities at a much lower price. In 1899, he also founded the \\"Zuccarrone Agricultural Brotherhood\\" (Fratellanza agricola Zuccarrone) to directly manage the 485 lots for the peasants of the Zuccarrone estate. The idea was to replace the old model of a single lease holder (a gabelloto, often a Mafia boss) with a \\"collective lease holder\\" through a peasant cooperative. These endeavours accelerated when, in the fall of 1901, Sicilian peasants - following the example of numerous agrarian strikes that were affecting the whole of Italy - set off a wave of agrarian unrest. They were conscious of the fact that in a way they resumed \\"the march abruptly interrupted in 1894 by the repression of the Fasci.\\" Just as the Fasci movement, one of the main goals of the 1901 strikes and was to undermine the economic power of the gabelotti. pp. 89-92 In 1901 the association obtained the lease of the Zuccarrone estate for one year and in 1902 on a longer lease agreement. In 1903, facing jail again for political reasons, Verro left Sicily for Marseilles (France). One year later he went to Tunis, where a Sicilian community existed. There, he started Il Socialista, as the organ of the Federation of Socialist Sicilian Workers. He finally returned to Sicily in 1906. Verro kept on organizing peasants and promoted the system of \\"collective renting\\" with other peasant leaders such as Lorenzo Panepinto from Santo Stefano Quisquina and Nicola Alongi from Prizzi which grabbed landholdings from the gabelloti ‚Äì local power brokers that leased large estates from absentee landlords ‚Äì and subleased plots to peasant at excessive or abusive rates. The gabelotti often organised in Mafia-type brotherhoods such as the Fratuzzi. Verro, un leader ¬´scomodo¬ª, La Sicilia, November 4, 2007 The cooperatives were not only means for political organisation but also of modernisation of agriculture encouraging modern techniques of cultivation and to encourage the processing of agricultural products and livestock. Un trionfo stroncato a colpi di pistola, La Sicilia, October 22, 2006 Cooperatives such as \\"The Earth\\" and the \\"Zuccarrone Agricultural Brotherhood\\" were rehearsals for the birth of the cooperative \\"Agricultural Union\\" (Unione Agricola), founded on June 2, 1906. This was the instrument through which Verro and other socialist leaders tried to answer the needs of the rural poor and free them from feudal slavery. The Union took advantage of new agrarian legislation passed by the Prime Minister Sidney Sonnino (Law no. 100 of 1906), which made cooperatives eligible for credit, to consolidate and extend the model of \\"collective leaseholds.\\" In quick succession, the cooperative obtained the lease of other estates.Lupo, History of the Mafia, pp. 154-57 Overall, in 1910 the cooperative came to manage approximately 2,500 hectares of land, divided into 1,289 shares. Mayor of Corleone Relations between Verro, landowners and his former allies from the Fratuzzi became ever more strained. In 1910, Verro launched a tax strike against the corrupt mayor of Corleone and denounced the affiliation between the Mafia and the Catholics. On November 6, 1910, the day of the municipal elections, he survived an attempt on his life. Two gunshots grazed his left wrist and made his hat fly, but he survived. The bullets fired at him stank of \\"Mafia and incense\\", Verro said. The fear for his life increased when his comrade Panepinto was killed by the Mafia in May 1911. Failing in the direct attempt on his life, his adversaries tried to infiltrate the successful \\"Agricultural Union\\" cooperative. The treasurer was arrested for fraud and counterfeit bills, but claimed he was working on Verro's orders. Verro was arrested on September 21, 1912, while attending the national convention of the League of Cooperatives in Rome. He remained in prison for ten long months. After the introduction of universal male suffrage in 1912, Verro became the Socialist candidate on the list for the June 1914 municipal elections, and achieved a resounding success: he was elected and the Socialist Party won 24 seats out of 30 on the city council.

He asks out one of the performing Washburn sisters for a date, and finds that Fay's parents once did a vaudeville act that Kip still knows by heart. Kip convinces Fay to do the old act themselves. But when he's offered a solo engagement, Kip grabs it, only to flop and be cheated out of his pay. He takes a small part in a show, lying to the Washburns that he was hired to be the lead, and does an impromptu gag that gets him fired. Fay needs a job, so she joins the chorus of old-time comedian Eddie Eagen's touring show. Kip takes a bit too much interest in Eddie's beautiful and much younger wife, Nancy, who co-stars in the revue. Kip ends up going on for Eddie during an illness, and then becomes his replacement. Eddie attempts a comeback when the show gets to New York, but collapses on stage. Kip's career takes off after that, but what he wants most is for Fay to take him back.

It is one of the most popular songs from his solo career and it's recognized as one of his signature songs. It was released as the twelfth track of the album Ah√≠ vamos (Spanish for There we go), in 2006. The song won the Latin Grammy in 2007 and the MTV Awards in 2006 for Best Rock Song among other awards (See \\"Crimen\\" Awards). Lyric \\"Crimen\\" has been considered one of the great Argentine rock ballads, along with songs such as Almendra's Muchacha (Ojos de papel). Music \\"Crimen\\" is a slow- paced rock ballad. It begins with a piano, which was unprecedented in Cerati's career. Ironically, this ballad is a large part of what made the largely rock- oriented Ah√≠ vamos so successful. Music video The music video was directed by Joaqu√≠n Cambre, who also made the video for \\"Adi√≥s\\". The video is set in the late 1940s, and Cerati opens saying: \\"Lately days and nights are too similar; if I've learned anything in this city it is that there are no guarantees; no one is giving away anything. Everything could turn out very badly ... but the case needed to be resolved. \\" The video shows a nonlinear story that begins with the end: the discovery of the murder of a private detective (Gustavo Cerati) in his office, at dawn. Then back to the past, where we explain the circumstances of the detective's death. The night before, Cerati begins to investigate the private life of a beautiful woman, on behalf of a client. He follows her to photograph evidence of her love affairs, and she catches him. Later in a bar, she seduces the detective in order to access the compromising photos. Both leave the place and drive to Cerati's office. Once there, she closes the door and shoots him repeatedly. The detective falls to the ground, dead, as the day begins to dawn. The video returns to a few seconds before the body was found in the opening sequence of the video (after the preface reported by Cerati). The staging is highlighted by a game of contrasts between light and shadow, and mastery of blue tone. In addition, the video draws attention to Cerati's radically different hair style. Known for his ruffled curls, in the video Cerati has slicked-back hair, carefully combed to the right side.

Johnson High School or J.O.J., was a public high school located in the northwest area of Huntsville, Alabama. The school served grades 9 through 12. It was home to an International Education Magnet Program, and the school also featured a Marine JROTC program. It was established in 1972 and closed in 2016.  History  The school was named for former Huntsville educator James Oliver Johnson, and served as a Brigadier General in the United States Army. Johnson commanded one of the first all black combat battalion in WW II, leading to the integration and racial diversity of the US Army. Johnson led men who constructed airplane infrastructure on the ground in North Africa and Mediterranean region, for Army Air Forces including the Tuskegee Airmen. True to the legacy of its namesake, JO Johnson was the first new High School in Huntsville, Alabama built as a racially integrated high school. Black and White Students had no strife, and became the model High School throughout the state shortly after the Civil Rights era. The road leading to the campus, Cecil Fain Drive, was named after another long term educator. J.O.J. opened in 1972 at 6201 Pueblo Drive, Huntsville, Alabama, to ease the overcrowding of Lee High School and to meet the needs of an area of Huntsville that had just begun to grow in population. Its primary feeder schools were the Academy for Science and Foreign Language, Edward H. White Middle School, and Davis Hills Middle School. In August 2012, the Huntsville City Schools announced plans to build a new school, and retain the name JO Johnson. In 2013, it was announced the school would receive a new building, but retain its name in 2016. The latest statement is that the Johnson name will not transfer to the new school (unlike the 4 other high schools rebuilt over the years) The school name will close and be changed to Mae Jemison High School and for the middle school that will share the campus, Ronald McNair Junior High School. These school names are named after the NASA Astronaut Mae Jemison On Thursday May 26, 2016, Johnson held its 44th and final Commencement Exercises at the Von Braun Center Arena.

Prisoner escort and custody lay observers carry out a similar function in relation to the escort of prisoners from one place to another, or their custody at court. Custody visiting originated as a result of the recommendations from the Scarman Report into the 1981 Brixton riots. Initially, the provision of custody visiting was voluntary on the part of the Police Authorities, but it was placed on a statutory basis in 2002.  Custody Visitors  = Statutory basis = In England and Wales, custody visitors are appointed by Police Authorities who are required, now by the Police Reform Act 2002, to make arrangements for custody visiting to take place. However the Act makes it clear that Custody Visitors are independent of both the Police Authority and the Chief Constable of the police force. The Act is supplemented by a code of practice made by the Home Secretary which sets out in more detail how custody visiting should work. In Northern Ireland, a similar arrangement is in place under the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000. There is no statutory scheme in Scotland, however all the police boards in Scotland operate a non-statutory scheme under guidance issued by the Scottish Government. = Visits to police stations = Visits to police stations by custody visitors are unannounced and can be made at any time. The custody visitors must be admitted to the custody suite immediately, unless there is a dangerous situation occurring.Section 51(3)(a) of the Police Reform Act 2002, and paragraph 36 of the Code of Practice They are allowed to speak to anyone being detained at the police station, unless a police Inspector (or higher rank) believes that access would place the custody visitors in danger or would ‚Äúinterfere with the process of justice‚Äù.Section 51(3)(c) and 51(4)-(5), and paragraphs 40-45 of the Code of Practice The visitors ask the detained person whether they have been informed of their rights under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act codes of practice (for example, to speak to a solicitor or to make a telephone call) and whether they are being treated properly.Paragraph 47 of the Code of Practice Visitors also check that the cells and other facilities within the custody suite, such as the toilets and food-preparation area, are clean.Section 51(3)(d) of the Police Reform Act 2002 The custody record, which records everything that happens to someone whilst they are in police custody, may also be examined.Section 51(3)(b) of the Police Reform Act 2002 and paragraphs 52-53 of the Code of Practice If the custody visitors find any issues, or a detained person raises an issue about their treatment, the visitors raise these with the officer in charge of the custody suite, or of the police station.Paragraphs 55-56 of the Code of Conduct The visitors complete a report of each visit, which will record their finding including any issues identified during the course of the visit. Copies of the report are sent to the Police Authority.Paragraph 58 of the Code of Practice = Independent Custody Visiting Association = Custody visitors are represented nationally by the Independent Custody Visiting Association (the ICVA) which provides training, publicity and support to custody visitors, and also to Police Authorities in carrying out their statutory duty to have in place custody visiting arrangements. Independent custody visiting, through the ICVA, has been nominated by the United Kingdom Government as one of the means by which the UK fulfills its responsibilities under the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.  Prisoner Escort and Custody Lay Observers  Lay observers carry out a similar function to that of custody visitors, but in relation to the escort of prisoners from one place to another, or their custody at court. The Criminal Justice Act 1991 provided for the contracting out of prisoner escort services, including the custody of prisoners on court premises. The Act also required the establishment of a panel of lay observers to inspect the conditions in which prisoners are transported or held. The Act is supplemented by Prison Service Orders and police policies where court prisoner custody is co-located with a police custody suite. In a report produced in 2005, HM Inspectorate of Court Administration and HM Inspectorate of Prisons commented that the training and reporting arrangements for lay observers were unsatisfactory. National training standards, regular re-appointment protocols and a national reporting platform to ensure speedy dissemination of reportable issues to various stakeholders within the Ministry of Justice were introduced in 2012. (Also in 2012, HM Inspectorate of Prisons drew up a programme for its own inspection of court custody facilities.)

He was governor of the Leeward Islands (1686) and the Province of Carolina (1703‚Äì1709).  Biography  Nathaniel Johnson was born on 7 April 1644, near Kibbelsworth, Durham. He joined the British Army in his youth. Eventually, he joined the Member of Parliament (MP) for Newcastle upon Tyne, 1680‚Äì1689. In 1686, he was appointed governor of the Leeward Islands, governing Treves, Saint Kitts, Montserrat, and Antigua. He travelled to the Province of Carolina in 1689, becoming its governor in 1703. While he started his government sanctioned \\"a blow at the Spanish interest directed against Louisiana and Florida: the Apalachee expedition of 1704\\". In 1702, while he governed there, he oversaw the defense of Charles Town against an attempted Franco-Spanish assault. In addition, he created the Parish system in this colony. Johnson rejected the constitutions of church and state because he believed these were dissenters of all denominations. So, to reduce or eliminate their power and influence, the Commons House of Assembly established a new bill that expulsed to the dissenters (who were mostly in South Carolina) of the Common House. The bill forced to the people who would want to be chosen in the Assembly accept and practice the rites of the Church of England, doing an oath, subscribing to a declaration and receiving a sacrament own of this church. The dissenters refused this measure because they thought the governor had taken away their civil rights and religious liberties. The residents of Colleton County, elaborated and written about his \\"grievous circumstances\\" and gave it to the Lords Proprietors with order that they remove the law. It was enacted, that twenty lay-persons be constituted a corporation for the exercise of ecclesiastical jurisdiction, with full power to deprive ministers of their livings at pleasure, not for immorality only, but also for imprudence, or on account of unreasonable prejudices taken against them. He ended his term in 1709 and died 1 July 1712 in Berkley County SC. Johnson had, at least, two children: Robert, also a future Governor of South Carolina, and Ann (who married Gov. Thomas Broughton).

He was of German and Danish descent, and partly served in the Danish army. Personal life He was born in Copenhagen as a son of Johan Georg R√¶der (1751‚Äì1808). The family soon moved to Romsdal, where he grew up. He was the great-grandson of Johan Georg Rh√§der, the person who immigrated to Norway and started the family branch there. He was also a brother of Nicolai Ditlev Amund R√¶der, Johan Philip Thomas R√¶der and Jacob Thode R√¶der.Dansk biografisk lexikon, volume 14, 1900 In November 1810 in Hals he married Kaja Munch (1794‚Äì1874), daughter of the Danish major Ole Munch. They had the children Jacques R√¶der, Ole Munch R√¶der, Nicolai Ditlev Ammon R√¶der and Johan Georg R√¶der. Through Nicolai he was the paternal grandfather of Anton Henrik R√¶der and Johan Christopher R√¶der. Through his Danish brothers he was an uncle of Carl Gustav Valdemar R√¶der, Johan Georg Frederik R√¶der and Oscar Alexander R√¶der and a granduncle of Hans Henning R√¶der. Career He took his military education in Copenhagen, and an engineer's examination in 1805. He served in the Royal Danish Army, from 1802 to 1805 in the Crown Prince Regiment, and from 1805 to 1809 in the Engineer Corps in Rendsborg. He served in the General Command in Jutland from 1809 and in Norway from January 1810. He served as an engineer officer at Kongsvinger Fortress, and fought in the Swedish campaign against Norway (1814). He served in Kristiania from 1815 to 1818, and in Trondhjem from 1818 to 1842. He was also manager of the engineer education at the Norwegian Military College from 1817 to 1818, and acting board member of the college from 1844 to 1845. He reached the rank of second lieutenant in 1803, captain in 1809/1810, major in 1818, lieutenant colonel in 1828 and colonel in 1842. After Norway's independence from Denmark in 1814 he experienced a personal crisis, since he was faced with giving up the allegiance to Denmark. He resigned from the Norwegian service, but retracted the resignation. He was even elected to the first session of the Parliament of Norway in 1814. He was later re-elected in 1815, representing the constituency of Hedemarkens Amt.

However, there are about as many understandings of contemporary African art as there are curators, scholars and artists working in that field. All three terms of this \\"wide-reaching non-category [sic]\\"Firstenberg, Lauri (2003). \\"Negotiating the Taxonomy of Contemporary African Art ‚Äì Production, Exhibition, Commodification\\", in Farrell, L. A., V. Byvanck (eds), Looking Both Ways: Art of the Contemporary African Diaspora. New York: Museum for African Art, p. 40. are problematic in themselves: What exactly is \\"contemporary\\", what makes art \\"African\\", and when are we talking about art and not any other kind of creative expression? Western scholars and curators have made numerous attempts at defining contemporary African art in the 1990s and early 2000s and proposed a range of categories and genres. They triggered heated debates and controversies especially on the foundations of postcolonial critique. Recent trends indicate a far more relaxed engagement with definitions and identity ascriptions. The global presence and entanglement of Africa and its contemporary artists have become a widely acknowledged fact that still requires and provokes critical reflection, but finds itself beyond the pressure of self-justification.  Scope  Although African art has always been contemporary to its producers, the term \\"contemporary African art\\" implies a particular kind of art that has conquered, or, as some would say, has been absorbed by the international art world and art market since the 1980s. It is in that decade when Europe and the United States became aware of art made in Africa by individual artists, thus breaking with the colonial tradition of assuming collective \\"ethnic\\" origins of so-called \\"tribal art\\" as found in most ethnographic collections.Firstenberg (2003). \\"Negotiating the Taxonomy of Contemporary African Art\\", in Farrell and Byvanck (eds), Looking Both Ways, pp. 37-41. The exhibition Magiciens de la terre by Jean-Hubert Martin in 1989 is widely considered (but also challenged as) a key exhibition in this very recent history of international reception of African and other non-western art. However, this reception, too, has its roots in an exotic and mystifying view on African culture from a dominant western position, as Rasheed Araeen argued in his response to Magiciens de la terre.Araeen, Rasheed (1989). \\"Our Bauhaus Others' Mudhouse\\", Third Text no. 6, pp. 3‚Äì16.See also Firstenberg, Lauri (2003). \\"Negotiating the Taxonomy of Contemporary African Art ‚Äì Production, Exhibition, Commodification\\", in Farrell, L. A., Byvanck, V. (eds), Looking both Ways: Art of the Contemporary African Diaspora. New York: Museum for African Art, pp. 37-41. Therefore, although this exhibition and many that followed had a strong influence in creating a kind of a common understanding of what constitutes contemporary African art, it is true that it has been and still is subject to discussions and controversies. Almost every exhibition following Magiciens de la terre offered a taxonomy or system of categorization that helped to reflect the very notion of contemporary African art, but they failed to recognize the postcolonial need of giving up the Eurocentric epistemology.Mosquera, Gerardo (1995). \\"Das Marco-Polo-Syndrom\\", in Hermanns, U. (ed.), Havanna. Sao Paulo. Junge Kunst aus Lateinamerika. Berlin: Haus der Kulturen der Welt, p. 34-39.Nzegwu, Nkiru (1998). \\"Introduction: Contemporary African Art and Exclusionary Politics\\", Issues in Contemporary African Art. Binghamton, NY: International Society for the Study of Africa ISSA, pp. 1‚Äì18. Contemporary African art is believed to feature particularities typical to African aesthetics while at the same time it shares properties with other international contemporary arts. Therefore, it is both, shaped by and feeding into the globalizing art worlds and art markets, like any other contemporary arts. At the same time, there are a lot of contemporary art practices and forms in African regions and cities that are almost exclusively locally known. While meeting all three requirements of being contemporary, art, and African, they fail to fit into a certain type of art production that has been spreading on the international art market in the last 30 years. Exhibitions variously showed work by artists based in Africa; by artists using aesthetics typical to African traditions; by African artists living in the West but including aesthetics and topics related to their \\"roots\\"; traditional artworks related to customary practices such as rituals; and urban African art that reflects the modern experience of cultural pluralism and hybridity. Modernity as a colonial and postcolonial experience appears as an intrinsic and significant attribute in most conceptions of contemporary African art. Scholars and curators therefore have proposed a wide range of taxonomies that tried firstly to define what is African about this art, and secondly, the range of genres it covers. Diverse attempts to define particular genres of contemporary African art however mirrored the fascination of art scholars and curators for the appropriation of cultural elements assumed \\"Western\\" into \\"African\\" modes of expression and traditions. One example is Marshall W. MountMount, Marshall W. (1973). African Art: The Years since 1920. Bloomington: Indiana University Press. who proposed four categories: first, \\"survivals of traditional styles\\", which show continuities in traditional working material and methods such as bronze casting or wood carving; secondly, art inspired by Christian missions; thirdly, souvenir art in the sense of tourist or airport art as defined later by Jules- Rossette;Jules-Rosette, Bennetta (1984). The Messages of Tourist Art: An African Semiotic System in Comparative Perspective. Boston: Springer. and finally, an emerging art requiring \\"techniques that were unknown or rare in traditional African art\\".Marshall W. Mount (1973) quoted in: Mudimbe, Valentin Y. (1991). \\"'Reprendre': Enunciations and Strategies in Contemporary African Arts\\", in Vogel, S. (ed.), Africa Explores: 20th Century African Art. Munich: Prestel, p. 279. Valentin Y. Mudimbe in turn proposes to think of three currents rather than categories, namely a \\"tradition-inspired\\" one, a \\"modernist\\" trend, and \\"a popular art\\"Mudimbe, Valentin Y. (1991). \\"'Reprendre': Enunciations and Strategies in Contemporary African Arts\\", in Vogel, S. (ed.), Africa Explores: 20th Century African Art. Munich: Prestel, p. 280. whereby Mount‚Äôs categories would be situated somewhere \\"between the tradition-inspired and the modernist trend‚Äù. Similar to other categorizations, this proposal considers the education of the artists as well as the envisaged clientele/patrons as important factors for the respective \\"currents\\". In the exhibition catalogue of Africa Explores (1991), curator Susan Vogel distinguished between \\"traditional art\\", \\"new functional art\\", \\"urban art\\", \\"international art\\", and \\"extinct art\\".Vogel, Susan, ed. (1991). Africa Explores: 20th Century African Art. Munich: Prestel. Rejecting these categories, collector Andr√© Magnin proposed to group similar works into sections named \\"territory\\", \\"frontier\\" and \\"world\\" in his survey book Contemporary African Art, thus placing them into \\"imaginary maps\\".Magnin, Andr√©, and Jacques Soulillou, eds (1996). Contemporary Art of Africa. London: Thames & Hudson. However, this approach was also criticized by Dele Jegede with convincing arguments against its ethnocentric perspective.Jegede, Dele (1998). \\"On Scholars and Magicians: A Review of 'Contemporary Art of Africa'\\", in Nzegwu, N. (ed.), Issues in Contemporary African Art. Binghamton: International Society for the Study of Africa ISSA, pp. 187-195. Among other things, he pointed to the hubris of attempts to talk about art of a whole continent, but also to the common reflex to exclude Northern Africa in such considerations and to follow a global rather than \\"particularistic focus on the study of the art of the continent\\" that would provide more specific and deeper bodies of knowledge. In the 1990 exhibition Contemporary African Artists: Changing Tradition, the Studio Museum in Harlem tried to take the perspective of the presented artists and distinguished between African artists who refuse outside influences; African artists who adopt modes of Western art; and African artists who fuse both strategies.Studio Museum, ed. (1990): Contemporary African Artists. Changing Tradition. New York: Studio Museum in Harlem. A commonality to all these categorizations is their reliance on dichotomies between art and craft, Europe and Africa, urban and rural, and traditional and contemporary. These dichotomies tend to consider mutual influences in African and European art as an exception rather than the norm. Even more, they fail to think of African art independent from Europe as its counterpart or \\"influence\\", resulting in a frequent reproach of African artists \\"copycatting\\" or \\"mimicking\\" European achievements of modernism.Oguibe, Olu (1999). \\"Art, Identity, Boundaries: Postmodernism and Contemporary African Art\\", in Oguibe, O., and O. Enwezor (eds), Reading the Contemporary: African Art from Theory to the Marketplace. Cambridge: MIT Press, pp. 16‚Äì29.Enwezor, Okwui, and Chika Okeke-Agulu (2009). Contemporary African Art since 1980. Bologna: Damiani, p. 21.Kasfir, Sidney L. (1999). Contemporary African Art. London/New York: Thames & Hudson. Such Eurocentric attitudes have been revealingly criticized by theorists such as Olu Oguibe, Rasheed Araeen, Nkiru Nzegwu, Okwui Enwezor or Salah Hassan.Hassan, Salah (1999). \\"The Modernist Experience in African Art: Visual Expressions of the Self and Cross-cultural Aesthetics\\", in Oguibe, O., and O. Enwezor (eds), Reading the Contemporary: African Art from Theory to the Marketplace. Cambridge: MIT Press, pp. 214‚Äì235. This problem is not easy to solve, and in some cases it is tackled by simply subverting any attempt of categorization. Seven Stories about Modern Art in Africa, directed by Cl√©mentine Deliss and curated by Chika Okeke-Agulu, Salah Hassan, David Koloane, Wanjiku Nyachae and El Hadji Sy (London, 1995) is a case in point.Deliss, Cl√©mentine, ed. (1995). Seven Stories about Modern Art in Africa. Paris/New York: Flammarion. Rather than grafting binary taxonomies, it narrated seven modern art histories in different parts of Africa by invited curators and artists who were familiar with these recent histories and their respective art scenes. The exhibition proved to offer a highly complex, historically informed and well-researched presentation. Another example for subverting binary taxonomies is the book Contemporary African Art after 1980 by Okwui Enwezor and Chika Okeke- Agulu.Enwezor, Okwui, and Chika Okeke-Agulu (2009). Contemporary African Art since 1980. Bologna: Damiani. Rather than putting contemporary African art in relation to Western traditions, they contrast it with modern African art, in that it defies linear grand narratives of modernism and is radically postcolonial. \\"[F]irst, within categories of time, it is neither belated nor does it exist out of time; second, because it is post-historical, it did not emerge out of a succession of historical styles; third, because it is critical of colonial valorization of an authentic past, it is postcolonial; and fourth, in relation to its post-colonialism, it seeks, according to Hans Belting‚Äôs thesis, to be post-ethnic [‚Ä¶]. Neither being out of time nor belated, contemporary African art strategically inhabits a third epistemological space by being in time.\\" As they add, this being \\"fundamentally of its time\\" counts for all contemporary art, not only the African. In their book, Enwezor and Okeke-Agulu discuss contemporary African art by its approaches and guiding topics rather than trying to define categories on the basis of styles, markets or traditions. Their chapters therefore are designated as \\"Between postcolonial utopia and postcolonial realism\\", \\"Networks of practice\\" in the globalized field of cultural production, \\"Politics, culture and critique\\", \\"Archive, document, memory\\", \\"Abstraction, figuration and subjectivity\\" and \\"The body politic: difference, gender, sexuality\\". Doing so, they locate contemporary African art within a historical perspective, something that had largely missed in previous discussions.

The alcazaba as it now appears was built by the Almohads in the 12th century, although it probably existed from the 9th century, when Badajoz was founded. In the 11th and 12th centuries it was the residence of the rulers of the taifa of Badajoz. It was declared a national monument of Spain in 1931. History Badajoz was founded by Abd-al Rahman Ibn Marwan in 875. After he had led several rebellions, he was expelled by M√©rida but was given the chance to found a new city. Here, on a hill commanding the new city, he built a large citadel which granted Badajoz a strategic role in controlling the passage from Portugal to central Iberia. The current line of walls date mostly from the Almohad age, although there are traces of earlier work from 913 and 1030; in 1169 the Almohad caliph Abu Yaqub Yusuf rebuilt the fortress, giving it its current appearance. The last Muslim restoration was carried on by Abu Yahya ibn Abi Sinan in the 13th century, few years before the capture of the city by the Christian King Alfonso IX of Le√≥n. During the Peninsular War (1805-1813) the citadel was successfully stormed by allied-British, Spanish & Portuguese forces under the command of the Duke of Wellington. As a result, the Napoleonic hold on Western Spain was significantly weakened, and the Storming of the Alcazaba became part of Wellington's growing reputation for success in battle. Description The citadel measures . It is bounded to the north by the Guadiana river and to the east by the Rivillas torrent. The less steep parts of the slopes and other strategically weak points are defended by towers. The whole line of walls features a parapet, while the barbican and the ditch which once added protection have disappeared. Palace of the Dukes of Feria. In the towers area was the palace of the lords of Badajoz, featuring several baths and mosques. After the Christian conquest, the largest, the Great Mosque, was turned into a church, ', which acted as the cathedral of Badajoz until the construction of the current one. The Great Mosque had five naves separated by arches supported by columns, and external buttresses. For its construction elements of Roman and Visigoth edifices were used, such as capitals and columns. Another building of the Muslim palace which was converted after the Christian conquest was the Military Hospital, now home to the Library of Extremadura. Torre de Espantaperros. Another building in the Alzacaba is the Palace of the Dukes of Feria, built by the Grand Master of the Order of Santiago, Lorenzo Su√°rez de Figeroa (1387‚Äì1410). Built in Renaissance style with Mud√©jar elements, it was restored in the 17th century. The fa√ßade features a central arch connecting two square towers with irregularly place windows; the palace has a trapezoidal plan and a cloister. It is currently home to the Provincial Archaeological Museum. Among the towers, the most significant is the Espantaperros Tower ( or '), built in 1169 and with a height of . It has an octagonal plan, and is surmounted by a small temple added in Mud√©jar style in the 16th century. Alp√©ndiz Tower and Gate.

Kalahandi, a district of Odisha, shelters a substantial tribal population residing both in hills and plain land. It is a place where people of different cultures, traditions, languages and beliefs live together. Culture Kalahandi is a rich land in terms of culture and festivals.Kalahandi: Loka Anusthan, Edited by Jayanta Kumar Behera, Dr Dolagobinda Bisi, Parameswar Mund, Mahabir Sanskrutika Anusthan, 1998 Since it is a melting point of South Odisha and Western Odisha with a substantial tribal population, those living in hills as well as plain land, their different culture, tradition, languages and belief along with mainstream Hindu culture have made Kalahandi region rich with culture and festivals. The mixture of Aryan and tribal culture makes Kalahandi region rich in its culture and festivals. In pre-independence period Kalahandi was largely inspired to Saivaism, Vaishanivism and Shakti puja. Shakti Puja is largely accepted among tribal, perhaps due to which Kalahandi was well known for celebrating Shati Puja. However, affect induction of Kalahandi as part of Odisha state, dominance of coastal Odisha culture in the state is increasingly influencing the local culture. Celebration of Rathajatra and construction of Jaggannath temple in Kalahandi has been increasingly realized unlike in old days of Radha Krishna temple.  Festivals  = Popular Hindu festivals = Durga Puja in Naktiguda,Kalahandi Chhatra Jatra in Bhawanipatna * Dasra (Dasara): Dasara or Durga Puja is celebrated among Hindu all over India, but it is very popular in Eastern part of India including West Bengal, Odisha, Assam etc. However, goddess Durga is known as Shaki (Energy) and most of the goddess based on tribal and Shaki is inspired from goddess Durga. The major goddess of Kalahandi including Mnikeswari, Lankeswari, Denteswari, Khameswari, Bhandargharen etc. are seen as a reflection of goddess Durga and most of the major festivals like Chhatar Jatra, Kkandabasha, Budharaja Jatra, etc. are celebrated during Dusra.

There is no current consensus among biologists on the questions of how sex in eukaryotes arose in evolution, what basic function sexual reproduction serves, and why it is maintained, given the basic two-fold cost of sex. It is clear that it evolved over 1.2 billion years ago, and that almost all species which are descendants of the original sexually reproducing species are still sexual reproducers, including plants, fungi, and animals. Meiosis is a key event of the sexual cycle in eukaryotes. It is the stage of the life cycle when a cell gives rise to two haploid cells (gametes) each having half as many chromosomes. Two such haploid gametes, arising from different individual organisms, fuse by the process of fertilization, thus completing the sexual cycle. Meiosis is ubiquitous among eukaryotes. It occurs in single-celled organisms such as yeast, as well as in multicellular organisms, such as humans. Eukaryotes arose from prokaryotes more than 2.2 billion years ago and the earliest eukaryotes were likely single-celled organisms. To understand sex in eukaryotes, it is necessary to understand (1) how meiosis arose in single celled eukaryotes, and (2) the function of meiosis.  Origin of meiosis  There are two conflicting theories on how meiosis arose. One is that meiosis evolved from prokaryotic sex (bacterial recombination) as eukaryotes evolved from prokaryotes. The other is that meiosis arose from mitosis. = From prokaryotic sex = In prokaryotic sex, DNA from one prokaryote is released into the surrounding medium, is then taken up by another prokaryote and its information integrated into the DNA of the recipient prokaryote. In modern prokaryotes the donor DNA is transferred by conjugation, transduction or transformation. Transformation is hypothesized to be the ancestral mechanism, in which DNA from one prokaryote is released into the surrounding medium and then taken up by another prokaryotic cell. One theory on how meiosis arose is that it evolved from transformation. According to this view, the evolutionary transition from prokaryotic sex to eukaryotic sex was continuous. Transformation, like meiosis, is a complex process requiring the function of numerous gene products. A key similarity between prokaryotic sex and eukaryotic sex is that DNA originating from two different individuals (parents) join up so that homologous sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information (a process called genetic recombination). After the new recombinant chromosome is formed it is passed on to progeny. When genetic recombination occurs between DNA molecules originating from different parents, the recombination process is catalyzed in prokaryotes and eukaryotes by enzymes that have similar functions and that are evolutionarily related. One of the most important enzymes catalyzing this process in bacteria is referred to as RecA, and this enzyme has two functionally similar counterparts that act in eukaryotic meiosis, RAD51 and DMC1. The evolution of meiosis from transformation happened as eukaryotes evolved through endosymbiosis between an anaerobic host cell, most likely to be an archaeon and an internalized aerobic bacterium, most likely to be a descendant of Œ±-proteobacterium, a likely ancestor of extant mitochondria. A genomic analysis on 630 orthologous groups hints a close evolutionary relationship between alpha-proteobacterial and eukaryotic proteins, suggesting there was indeed genetic transfer and, therefore, transformation between the two cells. Furthermore, in extant organisms, the RecA gene orthologs which are crucial for meiotic recombination have a high sequence similarity to that of the RecA gene in proteobacteria or cyanobacteria. This indicates a gene flow involving RecA gene or its orthologs from pre-mitochondrial bacteria to ancestral eukaryotes. Since the ancestors of eukaryotes were then homogenized to be able to undergo transformation, the genes needed for transformation, including RecA found in eubacteria and RAD51 family found in archaea, were likely descended to early eukaryotes as well and mutated into the ancestral meiotic genes. Support for the theory that meiosis arose from prokaryotic transformation comes from the increasing evidence that early diverging lineages of eukaryotes have the core genes for meiosis. This implies that the precursor to meiosis was already present in the prokaryotic ancestor of eukaryotes. For instance the common intestinal parasite Giardia intestinalis, a simple eukaryotic protozoan was, until recently, thought to be descended from an early diverging eukaryotic lineage that lacked sex. However, it has since been shown that G. intestinalis contains within its genome a core set of genes that function in meiosis, including five genes that function only in meiosis. In addition, G. intestinalis was recently found to undergo a specialized, sex-like process involving meiosis gene homologs. This evidence, and other similar examples, suggest that a primitive form of meiosis, was present in the common ancestor of all eukaryotes, an ancestor that arose from an antecedent prokaryote. =From mitosis= Mitosis is the normal process in eukaryotes for cell division; duplicating chromosomes and segregating one of the two copies into each of the two daughter cells, in contrast with meiosis. The mitosis theory states that meiosis evolved from mitosis. According to this theory, early eukaryotes evolved mitosis first, became established, and only then did meiosis and sexual reproduction arise. Supporting this idea are observations of some features, such as the meiotic spindles that draw chromosome sets into separate daughter cells upon cell division, as well as processes regulating cell division that employ the same, or similar molecular machinery. Yet there is no compelling evidence for a period in the early evolution of eukaryotes, during which meiosis and accompanying sexual capability did not yet exist. In addition, as noted by Wilkins and Holliday, there are four novel steps needed in meiosis that are not present in mitosis. These are: (1) pairing of homologous chromosomes, (2) extensive recombination between homologs; (3) suppression of sister chromatid separation in the first meiotic division; and (4) avoiding chromosome replication during the second meiotic division. Although the introduction of these steps seems to be complicated, Wilkins and Holliday argue that only one new step, homolog synapsis, that was particularly initiated in the evolution of meiosis from mitosis. Meanwhile, two of the other novel features appear to be simply modified, and extensive recombination could have evolved later. = Coevolution with mitosis = If meiosis arose from prokaryotic transformation, during the early evolution of eukaryotes, mitosis and meiosis could have evolved in parallel, with both processes using common molecular components, where mitosis evolved from the molecular machinery used by prokaryotes for DNA replication and segregation, and meiosis evolved from the prokaryotic sexual process of transformation, but meiosis also made use of the evolving molecular machinery for DNA replication and segregation.  Function  = Stress-induced sex = Abundant evidence indicates that facultative sexual eukaryotes tend to undergo sexual reproduction under stressful conditions. For instance, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (a single-celled fungus) reproduces mitotically (asexually) as diploid cells when nutrients are abundant, but switches to meiosis (sexual reproduction) under starvation conditions. The unicellular green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii grows as vegetative cells in nutrient rich growth medium, but depletion of a source of nitrogen in the medium leads to gamete fusion, zygote formation and meiosis. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, treated with H2O2 to cause oxidative stress, substantially increases the proportion of cells which undergo meiosis. The simple multicellular eukaryote Volvox carteri undergoes sex in response to oxidative stress or stress from heat shock. These examples, and others, suggest that, in simple single-celled and multicellular eukaryotes, meiosis is an adaptation to respond to stress. Prokaryotic sex also appears to be an adaptation to stress. For instance, transformation occurs near the end of logarithmic growth, when amino acids become limiting in Bacillus subtilis, or in Haemophilus influenzae when cells are grown to the end of logarithmic phase. In Streptococcus mutans and other streptococci, transformation is associated with high cell density and biofilm formation. In Streptococcus pneumoniae, transformation is induced by the DNA damaging agent mitomycin C. These, and other, examples indicate that prokaryotic sex, like meiosis in simple eukaryotes, is an adaptation to stressful conditions. This observation suggests that the natural selection pressures maintaining meiosis in eukaryotes are similar to the selective pressures maintaining prokaryotic sex. This similarity suggests continuity, rather than a gap, in the evolution of sex from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. Stress is, however, a general concept. What is it specifically about stress that needs to be overcome by meiosis? And what is the specific benefit provided by meiosis that enhances survival under stressful conditions? = DNA repair = In one theory, meiosis is primarily an adaptation for repairing DNA damage. Environmental stresses often lead to oxidative stress within the cell, which is well known to cause DNA damage through the production of reactive forms of oxygen, known as reactive oxygen species (ROS). DNA damages, if not repaired, can kill a cell by blocking DNA replication, or transcription of essential genes. When only one strand of the DNA is damaged, the lost information (nucleotide sequence) can ordinarily be recovered by repair processes that remove the damaged sequence and fill the resulting gap by copying from the opposite intact strand of the double helix. However, ROS also cause a type of damage that is difficult to repair, referred to as double-strand damage. One common example of double-strand damage is the double-strand break. In this case, genetic information (nucleotide sequence) is lost from both strands in the damaged region, and proper information can only be obtained from another intact chromosome homologous to the damaged chromosome. The process that the cell uses to accurately accomplish this type of repair is called recombinational repair. Meiosis is distinct from mitosis in that a central feature of meiosis is the alignment of homologous chromosomes followed by recombination between them. The two chromosomes which pair are referred to as non-sister chromosomes, since they did not arise simply from the replication of a parental chromosome. Recombination between non-sister chromosomes at meiosis is known to be a recombinational repair process that can repair double-strand breaks and other types of double-strand damage. In contrast, recombination between sister chromosomes cannot repair double-strand damages arising prior to the replication which produced them. Thus on this view, the adaptive advantage of meiosis is that it facilitates recombinational repair of DNA damage that is otherwise difficult to repair, and that occurs as a result of stress, particularly oxidative stress. http://www.hummingbirds.arizona.edu/Faculty/Michod/Downloads/IGE%20review%20sex.pdf If left unrepaired, this damage would likely be lethal to gametes and inhibit production of viable progeny. Even in multicellular eukaryotes, such as humans, oxidative stress is a problem for cell survival. In this case, oxidative stress is a byproduct of oxidative cellular respiration occurring during metabolism in all cells. In humans, on average, about 50 DNA double- strand breaks occur per cell in each cell generation. Meiosis, which facilitates recombinational repair between non-sister chromosomes, can efficiently repair these prevalent damages in the DNA passed on to germ cells, and consequently prevent loss of fertility in humans. Thus with the theory that meiosis arose from prokaryotic sex, recombinational repair is the selective advantage of meiosis in both single celled eukaryotes and muticellular eukaryotes, such as humans. An argument against this hypothesis is that adequate repair mechanisms including those involving recombination already exist in prokaryotes. Prokaryotes do have DNA repair mechanism enriched with recombinational repair, and the existence of prokaryotic life in severe environment indicates the extreme efficiency of this mechanism to help them survive many DNA damages related to the environment. This implies that an extra costly repair in the form of meiosis would be unnecessary. However, most of these mechanisms cannot be as accurate as and is possibly more mutagenic than the repair mechanism provided by meiosis. They primarily do not require a second homologous chromosome for the recombination that promotes a more extensive repair. Thus, despite the efficiency of recombinational repair involving sister chromatids, the repair still needs to be improved, and another type of repair is required. Moreover, due to the more extensive homologous recombinational repair in meiosis in comparison to the repair in mitosis, meiosis as a repair mechanism can accurately remove any damage that arises at any stage of the cell cycle more than mitotic repair mechanism can do and was, therefore, naturally selected. In contrast, the sister chromatid in mitotic recombination could have been exposed to similar amount of stress, and, thus, this type of recombination, instead of eliminating the damage, could actually spread the damage and decrease fitness. = Genetic diversity = On the other view, stress is a signal to the cell that the environment is becoming adverse. Under this new condition, it may be beneficial to produce progeny that differ from the parent in their genetic make up. Among these varied progeny, some may be more adapted to the changed condition than their parents. Meiosis generates genetic variation in the diploid cell, in part by the exchange of genetic information between the pairs of chromosomes after they align (recombination). Thus, on this view, the advantage of meiosis is that it facilitates the generation of genomic diversity among progeny, allowing adaptation to adverse changes in the environment. However, in the presence of a fairly stable environment, individuals surviving to reproductive age have genomes that function well in their current environment. They raise the question of why such individuals should risk shuffling their genes with those of another individual, as occurs during meiotic recombination? Considerations such as this have led many investigators to question whether genetic diversity is the adaptive advantage of sex.

Vergana was built in 1897 as a private steel-hulled, schooner-rigged steam yacht of the same name by T. S. Marvel at Newburgh, New York, for F. S. Flower of New York City. Flower later sold her to Wilbert Melville of Los Angeles, California, who in turn sold her to stationer and printer Charles H. Crocker in either late 1916 or early 1917. By the time the United States entered World War I on 6 April 1917, she was registered at San Francisco, California, and home-ported at Belvedere Cove, California. The U.S. Navy acquired Vergana from Crcoker in the spring of 1917 for use as a section patrol vessel during World War I. The date of her acquisition and delivery to the Navy are unclear; according to her logbook, her first commanding officer, Ensign E. Dahlgren, USNRF, reported aboard on 16 April 1917, but some sources state that she was not delivered to the Navy until 4 May 1917. She was commissioned as USS Vergana (SP-519) on 10 July 1917. Vergana performed harbor entrance patrol duty at San Francisco almost continually for the duration of World War I. She alternated on duty with the U.S. Navy patrol vessels and (ex-USS California), and the tug both underway at the mouth of San Francisco Bay and stationary at guard duty beside a pier. Decommissioned at the Mare Island Navy Yard at Vallejo, California, on 16 January 1919, Vergana apparently remained in reserve thereafter. When the U.S. Navy adopted its modern hull number system on 17 July 1920, she was classified as an \\"old district patrol craft\\" and redesignated OYP-519. Vergana was ordered sold on 30 September 1921. An initial sale, of that date, was never consummated, but on 25 February 1922 she was sold to Louis A. Fracchia of Oakland, California.

Designed in the Spanish Colonial Revival Style, the theater has hosted live events, films, and radio broadcasts. History On October 20, 1926, the Carter DeHaven Music Box opened with a revue called Fancy. It had been planned to open the theatre two days earlier however a postponement was caused by the illness of Arthur Kay, a principal actor. Among the first investors in the new theater were John Barrymore, John Gilbert, Reginald Denny, King Vidor, and Mae Murray. The Music Box switched from revues to legitimate theater in 1927 with the west coast premi√®re of Chicago, starring Clark Gable and Nancy Carroll. Stage plays continued at the Music Box for nearly two decades‚Äîaside from a period beginning in 1936 when the site was used as a broadcasting studio by Lux Radio Theater. In 1945, Fox West Coast purchased the building and remodeled it for film exhibition in a Streamline Moderne decor, which included covering the Spanish Colonial Revival fa√ßade with sheet metal. Opening in February 1945, the theater showed movies for 32 years; first as the Guild Theatre, then as the Fox Theatre, and finally as the Pix Theatre, before closing its doors in 1977. The Nederlander Organization reopened the house as a legitimate theater in 1985 and renamed it in honor of film and stage actor Henry Fonda. In ensuing years, productions such as the Pulitzer Prize winning play Glengarry Glen Ross, and Driving Miss Daisy graced the stage. Efforts to restore the theater to its Roaring Twenties glory began in 2002, culminating in the original name being placed back on the marquee. In 2012, Goldenvoice took over the Music Box and changed the name back to The Fonda Theatre. The theater was named the top venue in Los Angeles by LA Weekly in 2015. Avenged Sevenfold filmed a music video for the song Unholy Confessions in 2004 at the Fonda Theatre. The Bachelor was filmed live at the Fonda Theatre on January 7, 2019.

Founded in 1834 by a committed local resident who petitioned the Archbishop of Canterbury for permission to establish a chapel in the poor agricultural village, the church proved popular‚Äîdespite the competing presence of two Nonconformist chapels nearby‚Äîand was extended in 1913. The stone-built church, with its tall spire and well-regarded \\"living churchyard\\" nature reserve, is now Hadlow Down's only remaining place of worship. English Heritage has listed it at Grade II for its architectural and historical importance. History Hadlow Down's name suggests that a settlement existed in Saxon times: it was first recorded as Headda's leah, a forest clearing (leah in Anglo-Saxon) governed by Headda. \\"Down\\" was appended in the 14th century to describe the hilly nature of the land, and the present name emerged by the early 19th century, when the present linear village began to develop. The village straddled the boundary of two large rural parishes, Buxted and Mayfield, and was nominally served by those villages' churches‚ÄîSt Margaret the Queen's Church and St Dunstan's Church respectively. These were both more than three miles away, and the owner of Buxted Lodge (a large house in Hadlow Down), Benjamin Hall, was concerned about the number of villagers who could not attend church. Furthermore, a Nonconformist place of worship‚Äîthe Providence Chapel‚Äîhad been founded in the centre of the village in 1824, potentially attracting people away from the Church of England's ministry. In 1834, he wrote to the Archbishop of Canterbury, William Howley, seeking permission and funds to build a church in the village‚Äîadding that \\"very many poor children [were] wandering about the lanes in ignorance of almost every duty, moral or religious\\". The Archbishop supported Hall's idea, but advised that money would be limited‚Äîalthough within a few months, the reforms instituted by the Ecclesiastical Duties and Revenue Commission led to initiatives such as the founding of the Society for Building Churches and Chapels, whose purpose was to provide funds to establish new churches. At the time, Hadlow Down's residents were mostly poor: most people worked as farm labourers, and the early 19th century was a particularly difficult time. Nevertheless, Hall sought to raise funds as quickly as possible. He published a documentIllustrated in detailing his case for the building of the church‚Äîprincipally that a rapidly growing population of about 700 was served by two churches more than away‚Äîand the funding requirements for building work (estimated at ¬£1,800) and the endowment for the vicar (suggested as ¬£100 per year). He then listed the people and bankers who would be in charge of receiving donations‚Äîincluding himself, the 3rd Earl of Liverpool (owner of nearby Buxted Park) and the Vicar of Mayfield‚Äîand included a list of all benefactions received so far, with names, place of residence and value: from the ¬£100 subscriptions from the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Vicars of Mayfield and Buxted and other prominent local figures to donations of five shillings from local farmworkers. This may have been an attempt to prompt others into donating or increasing their gift by playing on their sense of propriety or shame. A \\"Queen Anne's Bounty\\" of ¬£200 was also received from the fund established in 1704 to help improve the incomes of Anglican clergy, and the 5th Earl De La Warr gave ¬£200 worth of stone to build the walls. A local building firm constructed the church to the designs of William Moseley. He worked mainly in London, but also designed several Gothic Revival churches in the north of Sussex‚Äîat Forest Row, Holtye Common, Horsham and Uckfield. His design for St Mark's Church was based on that of Holy Trinity Church at Forest Row, which was being built at the same time. The plan consisted of a nave without aisles, a chancel and a buttressed tower at the west end topped by a slim spire. Moseley adopted a cost-saving technique in his design for the tower and spire‚Äîwhich ended up damaging the building‚Äî and provided space for about 420 worshippers, in both private rented pews (82) and free seats (260, plus an 80-capacity gallery). Building work started on 21 April 1835 (prompting the Vicar of Mayfield to write a commemorative poem) and finished in 1836, and Archbishop of Canterbury William Howley consecrated the church on 6 May 1836 in front of 500 guests. A debt of about ¬£400 remained at that time, and in 1837 the church faced another problem when dry rot caused structural damage. In the same year, it became a parish church when a parish was carved out of Buxted and Mayfield districts. Hadlow Down gained a third place of worship in the late 1880s, when the corrugated iron Gate House Baptist Chapel was built on the outskirts. It was moved to a site near St Mark's Church in 1907. Meanwhile, the Providence Chapel (also used by Baptists by this time) continued to thrive. By 1913, the church was in disrepair. The spire was too heavy for the tower, and Moseley's design resulted in structural damage developing. The spire had to be shortened and capped, but this did not help. Charles Lang Huggins , a relative of Benjamin Hall, paid for the building to be rebuilt to a design by architect George Fellowes Prynne. Huggins supplied stone quarried from his own land at Hadlow Grange. Fellowes Prynne studied architecture in Canada and later worked with George Edmund Street. He was responsible for St Wilfrid's Church at Bognor Regis and the fittings (especially reredoses) of many other churches in Sussex. There is uncertainty over how extensive his work at St Mark's Church was, and whether it can be considered a mere remodelling or a complete reconstruction. The chancel is entirely new, as are the aisles of the nave; the nave retains its original stonework and size, but the tracery in the lancet windows and the arcades at the east and west ends are probably Fellowes Prynne's; the tower and spire were renewed, although their appearance is little changed; and a \\"pert bellcote\\" (in Nikolaus Pevsner's words) was added on the east end of the roof. Another innovation was electric lighting. Charles Lang Huggins employed the Miller and Selmes firm of Eastbourne to build the church. One of their workers added his mark on the spire by deliberately erecting the weather vane upside down; he was sacked for this attempt at humour. The Bishop of Chichester, Charles Ridgeway, reconsecrated the church in October 1913. The Parochial church council raised concerns about the condition of the churchyard in 1931. A document issued on 31 October 1931Illustrated in observed that its \\"overgrown\\" state gave \\"the appearance of sad neglect\\", and proposed that grave mounds would be levelled, shrubbery would be removed and elaborate gravestones would no longer be permitted. The scheme was not successful, but over the ensuing decades an impressive range of wild flowers have grown in parts of the churchyard, which is now maintained as a nature reserve by the \\"Living Churchyard\\" conservation project. Burials include Brigadier-General Edmund Costello , who was awarded the Victoria Cross in 1897 for gallantry during the Siege of Malakand. Architecture The bellcote St Mark's Church is a Gothic Revival building in the 14th-century Perpendicular style. It is built entirely of local stone. There is a short tower at the west end, topped by a recessed broach spire with shingles and dormer openings. The base of the tower forms a porch containing the entrance. Beyond this, the nave has an arch-braced roof, aisles on both sides and a three-part arcade‚Äîa layout favoured by George Fellowes Prynne. The side arches lead to a Lady chapel (attached to the south side of the chancel) and a vestry. The gable end of the chancel roof has a bellcote. Fittings include a wrought iron rood screen attributed to Fellowes Prynne, a stained glass east window of the early 20th century, small stained glass windows in the Lady chapel inserted in 1949‚Äì50, and a version of the Madonna of the Magnificat painted by the architect's brother Edward A. Fellowes Prynne. He designed fittings, stained glass and paintings (mostly in the Pre-Raphaelite style) for many churches, including at Brighton (St Peter's Church), East Grinstead and Pagham. Fellowes Prynne completed the painting in 1899 and exhibited it at the Royal Academy; Charles Lang Huggins bought it but donated it to St Mark's Church instead of displaying it in the private chapel at his house as originally intended. The church windows include two by Percy Bacon from the early 20th century (\\"Madonna & child with angels\\" and \\"Suffer little children\\") and a smaller window by Francis Skeat from 1948, featuring the Christian year in wild flowers. The church today St Mark's Church was listed at Grade II by English Heritage on 31 December 1982; this defines it as a \\"nationally important\\" building of \\"special interest\\". As of February 2001, it was one of 2,020 Grade II listed buildings, and 2,173 listed buildings of all grades, in the district of Wealden. The parish is now united with that of Buxted. Legally known as the Parish of Buxted and Hadlow Down, its three churches (St Margaret the Queen's Church at Buxted Park, St Mary the Virgin in the centre of Buxted village and St Mark's) serve a large rural area with the east‚Äìwest A272 road at its centre. The western boundary is close to the hamlets of Five Ash Down and Cooper's Green on the A26; the eastern side runs close to Five Ashes village and the A267 road; and the northern and southern borders follow field boundaries. About 5,000 people live in the parish. St Mark's Church maintains links with St Mark's Church of England Primary School, built next to the church in the late 19th century as a National school. It has always had a large, mostly rural catchment area.

The Hebrew Orphan Asylum was designed by Lupus & Roby, the partnership of Edward Lupus (1834‚Äì1877) and Henry Albert Roby (1844‚Äì1905), and constructed by Edward Brady (1830‚Äì1900). (51 pages, including 16 photos from 2009) The history of the development at the site of the current building began in 1815 with the construction of \\"Calverton,\\" the country home of Baltimore banker Dennis Smith. This building was re-purposed and expanded for use as the Baltimore City and County Almshouse from 1820 through 1866. Calverton featured a central mansion for caretakers, large wings on either side for male and female dormitories and a \\"lunatic\\" hospital. The Hebrew Orphan Asylum was established in 1872 and operated in the Calverton mansion until displaced by a fire in 1874. After some deliberation, the leaders of the Hebrew Orphan Asylum decided to rebuild at the same location following a design by architects Lupus & Roby. Entrance The Hebrew Orphan Asylum moved to a new facility in 1923 and the building transitioned to serve as the West Baltimore General Hospital from 1923 through 1950. The facility then became the Lutheran Hospital of Maryland and remained in use from 1950 to 1989. The history of the building as a hospital included the addition of several related structures to the campus only one of which, a 1945 maternity ward, remaining extant. This building, designed by Henry Powell Hopkins and built by the John K. Ruff Company, now operates as the Tuerk House, a residential drug and alcohol rehab facility.

The film is vividly real in its humanistic portrayals and natural landscapes, but under the folkloric lens of Rasoulof, Panahi and Ghafori it drifts into magic- realism.‚Äù - Jason Cangialosi, writing at 2010 Denver Film Festival for Yahoo!

After the death of his teacher Ba Nyan, he was recognized as the greatest living painter in Myanmar. He had great influence on the next generation of artists, and his works are now highly sought after. Life Of Burmese Chinese ancestry, Ngwe Gaing was born in Myeik and was raised in Dawei. He was initially self-taught and then improved his skills via an American correspondence painting course. He was forced to work at a number of menial jobs until he was able to support himself as an artist. He was first taught by Po Aung and later by Ba Ohn and Ba Sein, finally becoming a pupil of the famous artist Ba Nyan, after Ba Nyan returned from England in 1930. Ngwe Gaing, however, was not a formal live-in apprentice of Ba Nyan, rather studying with Ba Nyan on weekends in his free time. With Ba Nyan's death in 1945, Ngwe Gaing was recognized as Burma's leading artist. During a drive to stamp out corruption in the post-independence period, he collaborated with the cartoonist Ba Gyan to produce a series of powerful and effective posters. In 1952 he was sent to England for a year, where he painted copies of Burmese antiquities in the Victoria & Albert Museum. In 1953, he was given the title Alinga Kyawzwa, the highest title that can be bestowed on an artist in Burma. In his private life, Ngwe Gaing was also a well known alchemist and clairvoyant. He was an honest, hardworking and unassuming person. Work Ngwe Gaing was a prolific and versatile painter who worked in both oil and watercolour (both transparent and gouache), and he also did pencil drawings. His subjects comprised a wide range‚Äîhistorical paintings, landscapes, portraits, and still life. His oil paintings were meticulous in their attention to detail. They typically used heavily but carefully applied brush strokes, in the impasto style, and an array of complex colour designs. According to the artist Min Naing, he excelled in his choice of \\"poster subjects and settings\\". Another commentator, speaking of his series of large historical panels, said his power perhaps showed to better advantage in easel works such as the romantic \\"Recluse in the Forest\\" or a graceful portrait of one of Burma's classical dancers. He painted stage settings for films on traditional themes before the war, and when there was a vogue for stage plays after World War II, he painted stage settings for the makeshift Myaing Theatre in the Kandawgyi Park. Some of his paintings were huge, up to 20√ó60 feet (6√ó20 meters), such as a work he executed in 1963 for the first Workers Conference. He painted portraits of notable people such as President Ba U, film star Wah Wah Win Shwe and film director Shumawa U Kyaw. His mnemonic powers in Burma, in which he painted portraits of subjects from memory, were famous in Burma, although he is also known to have started a painting from a photograph and then only require the model for the final stages. He made a series of paintings of historic events, including \\"The Battle of Shwedaung\\", \\"The Flag Hoisting Ceremony on Independence Day\\", \\"The Panlong Accord\\" and \\"the Nay Thurein Congress\\". Other works depicted scenes of the Jataka tales, and events in the life of the Buddha. He traveled widely in Burma to find subjects, making sketches that he would later paint in oils or watercolours, often scenes of the daily life of ordinary people and particularly portraits of Burma's many ethnic peoples. The latter subject was a major enterprise which he embarked upon. Legacy The Shan State Museum holds two of his classic works: \\"The Hopong Springs\\" and \\"The Stately Procession of the Hpaung-Daw-Oo Buddha Images\\". The National Museum in Yangon displays other masterpieces including \\"the Isle of Myeik\\", \\"Scenic Ranaung\\", \\"The Inlay Floating Bazaar\\", \\"Scenic Environs of Dawei\\", \\"Maungmagan\\" and \\"Some of our Ethnic Brethren\\". His last work was a series of scenes from the Jatakas for the \\"Shwe Mokhti\\" pagoda in Dawei, where they hang in the covered passageways to the pagoda. Works by Ngwe Gaing are also held in the Singapore Art Museum and other prominent regional collections. Ngwe Gaing is considered one of the great masters of modern Burmese painting. He made an outstanding contribution through his versatility, technical skill and influence on a generation of Burmese painters. In the post-WWII years, many painters sought instruction from Ngwe Gaing, packing his studio to watch him work, just as painters had flocked to Ba Nyan in the pre-war years. Among the painters influenced by Ngwe Gaing were Myat Kyaw, San Win, Hla Shein, Ko Lay, Hla Maung Gyi, Nann Wai, Thein, Han Tin, San Pe, M. Tin Aye, and Lun Gywe.

He served briefly in the American Civil War and then in an 1898 expedition to Alaska. He commanded a U.S. Army company in the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War and later served in the civilian administration of the Philippines. On June 26, 1929 Yellowstone Kelly was laid to rest with full military honors overlooking the Yellowstone Valley in Billings, Montana after an impressive funeral procession. Early life Luther Sage Kelly was born July 27, 1849, in Geneva, New York. His father, also named Luther Kelly, owned a drug and grocery store in Geneva. His mother, Jeanette Eliza Sage, was the daughter of Colonel Hezekiah Sage of nearby Chittenango. Kelly's father died on February 14, 1857, leaving him the man of the family, but the family had enough money saved to live comfortably.Keenan (2006), pp. 11 -12 In either late 1864 or early 1865, Kelly entered the Geneva Wesleyan Seminary,Keenan (2006), p. 13 but his real interest was in joining the army and fighting in the Civil War; he would later write that he \\"deplored the fact\\" that his youth rendered him unfit for military service at that time. Military service In the spring of 1865, with the Civil War winding down, Kelly secured permission from his mother to join the Army. He traveled to Rochester, New York, where he attempted to join the Fourth New York Cavalry but was turned down due his young age (15).Keenan (2006), p. 14 Later he joined the 10th Infantry by lying about his age. He was unaware that the 10th Infantry was not a volunteer corps and that he would be obliged to continue serving after the war. Kelly was sent to City Point, Virginia. After Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox his regiment was sent to Richmond and then marched towards Washington, D.C., encamping south of the Potomac River until after the Grand Review of the Armies. Because Kelly's unit had not participated in the Grand Review, it was selected for a parade through Washington on June 8, during which Kelly served as part of the guard detail for the reviewing officer, \\"his first official duty of any real consequence\\".Keenan (2006), pp. 15‚Äì16 Kelly's unit was stationed in Washington over the summer. In November they were moved by train to St. Paul, Minnesota to be stationed at Fort Snelling for the winter.Keenan (2006), p. 17 In May, his company moved among Fort Abercrombie, Fort Wadsworth and Fort Ransom, all in the Dakota Territory. During his free time at these forts, Kelly hunted game to provide fresh meat for his fellow soldiers. In April 1868, Kelly's enlistment in the Army ended, and he was discharged at Fort Ransom.Keenan (2006), p. 21 American Western Frontier, 1868‚Äì1885 Kelly's duel with two Sioux warriors, as depicted by Charles Russell After leaving the army, Kelly embarked on what The New York Times later called \\"the most adventurous period of his life\\", establishing himself as \\"one of the greatest hunters, trappers, and Indian scouts\\" of the American West. He first traveled to Fort Garry, now Winnipeg in Canada, where he joined a group of miners, traveling with them to the Red River, where he spent the winter. He left the miners to cross the Assiniboine River, falling in with a group headed toward the Mouse River. After meeting Sitting Bull with this group, Kelly headed alone toward the Missouri River, eventually reaching Fort Buford in the winter. Not long after his arrival at Fort Buford, Kelly volunteered to carry dispatches to Fort Stevenson, approximately fifty miles down the Missouri River. He left the fort on February 5, 1869.Keenan (2006), p. 34 The route between the forts was considered so dangerous, due to the presence of Sioux warriors, that mail carriers were generally accompanied by a cavalry escort, but Kelly set out alone. He arrived safely at Fort Stevenson then set out on his return journey, spending the night at the camp of Bloody Knife, an Arickaree chieftain. The next morning, Kelly was ambushed by two Sioux warriors. The first wounded Kelly's horse with a rifle, while the second shot Kelly in the knee with an arrow. Kelly managed to shoot and kill the first attacker quickly, but the second took cover behind a tree. Kelly eventually shot and killed his second assailant, then returned to Bloody Knife's camp to tell the story.Russell, p. 25 Kelly spent a few days at Bloody Knife's camp recovering from his wound, then rode back to Fort Buford, becoming \\"something of a hero and a local celebrity\\" for defeating his two assailants.Keenan (2006), p. 35 Alaska expedition, 1898 Although the United States had purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867, Americans were not interested in it until gold was discovered there in 1896.Keenan p. 168 In 1898 the U.S. Army deployed three separate units under the commands of Captains Bogardus Eldridge, William R. Abercrombie, and Edwin F. Glenn to map a route from the Yukon, scout the Copper River Valley, and conduct reconnaissance. They would begin near the Prince William Sound and work toward the interior.Keenan p. 169 Kelly was assigned to Glenn's unit as an interpreter and guide. Departing Seattle by ship on April 7, 1898, they arrived along the Alaskan coastline approximately five days later. While unloading and preparing for the expedition, they received news of the outbreak of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War on April 23.Keenan p. 175 Eldridge's unit was ordered to return to its regiment, while Abercrombie and Glenn's parties were to continue their assigned missions. Although the other soldiers were eager to return to their regiments to join the war, they reasoned that it would be mostly a naval war with little role for the Army.Keenan p. 176 Support for the expedition dwindled in light of the American public's enthusiasm for the war.Keenan p. 172 In accordance with President William McKinley's request for additional men for the war, Kelly was offered a commission as a captain in the U.S. Volunteers. Kelly departed Alaska on October 9, and Glenn's unit continued its mission until November 10. By the time Kelly arrived back in Seattle the war had ended, and with it his captaincy. The Army's expedition into Alaska was largely overshadowed by the war in the public eye and in contemporary historians' accounts. It made possible the completion in 1923 of the Alaska Railroad, which followed the route mapped by the 1898 expedition.Keenan p. 195 A year later came the maritime Harriman Alaska Expedition. Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War In August 1899 Kelly received another commission as a captain, this time with the Army's 40th Volunteers, following Congress's authorization of an increase in the Army by 35,000 men to put down the insurgency in the Philippines.Keenan p. 198, 216, 202 This war, unlike the six-month war with Spain with 500 combat deaths, \\"would drag on for three long years\\"Keenan p. 202 and cost the lives of over 4,000 U.S. servicemen. The 40th Regiment departed from Fort Riley, Kansas, by train in November 1899 for California. After two weeks there, they shipped out from the Presidio, arriving in the Philippines in late December 1899.Keenan p. 217 Kelly's company was under the command of Brigadier General James Bell, who had served with Kelly during the Nez Perce campaigns of the Indian Wars. Captain Kelly's company aboard the vessel Venus departed Manila along with four other transports headed for the shores of San Miguel Bay. From there the companies began their marches inland to clear the areas of insurgents. Kelly's company met heavy resistance on the outskirts of the town of LaLud. Insurgents under the command of a Colonel LegaspiKeenan p. 226 opened fire on Kelly's advancing infantrymen with two field guns, but Kelly's men managed to kill the enemy artillerymen and silence the guns. With heavy foliage flanking the enemy's position, Kelly led a frontal assault and routed them. In the process, Kelly captured Legaspi's ceremonial Spanish sword. Kelly later served in the administration of the new civilian governor of the Philippines, future President William Howard Taft. By 1903, as Kelly wrote to a friend, \\"I have been in the Philippines so long now (3 years) ... this country is a wearing one. ... my health is excellent, but three years is the limit.\\"Keenan p. 242 On November 15, 1903, Kelly was relieved of his duties in the Philippines and ordered to report back to Washington, D.C., for his next assignment, as Indian Agent for the San Carlos Indian Reservation in Arizona. Post-military life In 1915, after a few years gold mining in Nevada, Kelly settled permanently in Paradise, California, where, on 17 December 1928, he died. He was buried on a high bluff along the Yellowstone River just north of Billings MontanaBrowning, James A. Violence Was No Stranger.

As well as holding several major administrative positions in the Belgian Congo, he is particularly known for his role as commander of the Belgian colonial military, the Force Publique, during the first years of World War I. His military career culminated in the capture of Tabora in German East Africa in September 1916. Biography Tombeur was born in Li√®ge, Belgium in 1867 and enlisted in the Belgian Army at the age of 16. He was later admitted to the Belgian Royal Military Academy in Brussels, graduating in 1898. In 1902, he enlisted for service in the Congo Free State, a quasi-independent state controlled by Belgium's monarch Leopold II, as a junior officer in the Force Publique. He remained in position through the Belgian annexation of the Free State as the Belgian Congo until 1909. Returning to Belgium, he served briefly as aide-de- camp to King Albert I from 1909 to 1912. In 1912, Tombeur returned to the Congo as an civilian inspector general (inspecteur d'√©tat) where he became the senior administrator for Katanga Province and presided over the first years of the city of √âlisabethville (modern-day Lubumbashi). Following the outbreak of World War I and the German invasion of Belgium, Tombeur became the commander of the Belgian colonial forces on the border with German East Africa. He presided over the re-organisation of the Force Publique and, in April 1916, led a Belgian force into Rwanda as part of the British-led East African Campaign. By June 1916, the whole of Rwanda had fallen and Burundi was occupied soon afterwards. Tombeur was made military governor of the Belgian Occupied East African Territories consisting of the future Belgian mandate of Ruanda-Urundi. The expeditionary force soon headed for the German military stronghold at Tabora in modern-day Tanzania. After a lengthy battle, Tombeur entered the town on 20 September 1916. Tombeur was recalled to Europe in late 1916 and was replaced as commander in East Africa by Armand Huygh√©. In early 1917, he was promoted to the rank of Vice-Governor-General, the second highest administrative position in the Congo. He served as governor of Katanga from 1918 to 1920. Tombeur retired from the colonial service in July 1920 but remained active within colonial associations in Belgium. In 1926, Albert I awarded him the title Baron of Tabora. He died in 1947.

He led the Cairo branch of the Islamist group al-Jihad (also Tanzim al-Jihad) and made a significant contribution in elevating the role of jihad in radical Islam with his pamphlet The Neglected Obligation (also The Neglected Duty). He was executed in 1982 for his role in coordinating the assassination of Egyptian president Anwar Sadat the previous year. Life Born in El Delengat neighborhood of Beheira, Egypt, Faraj graduated in electrical engineering and worked as an administrator in Cairo University. Faraj began to develop the revolutionary group that would become al-Jihad in 1979.cns Faraj, an engaging speaker, recruited individuals who heard him preach jihad in mosques.Gerges, The far enemy, 2010: 9 Over the next two years these individuals recruited others and in this way Faraj came to be the overall leader of a loose group of around five revolutionary cells.Sageman, Understanding Terror Networks, 2004: 134 These cells, one of which was led by Ayman al-Zawahiri retained a degree of independence but met regularly and had a joint strategy.Sageman, Understanding Terror Networks, 2004: 30 In late September 1981 Faraj held a meeting with other al-Jihad leaders to discuss a plot to assassinate Anwar Sadat. The idea had been proposed to him by Khalid Islambouli, a lieutenant in the Egyptian Army whom Faraj had invited to join al-Jihad when he was posted to Cairo six months before. Islambouli had learned that he was to be involved in a celebratory parade involving the President and saw an opportunity. Despite disagreements among the leaders, the plan went ahead. Sadat was killed on 6 October. Faraj was quickly arrested and was executed on 15 April 1982, along with Islambouli and three accomplices.Sageman, Understanding Terror Networks, 2004: 32-3 Ideas Mainstream Salafism argues that Muslims should aim to emulate the practices of the Prophet and his companions and believe that the failure to do so is responsible for the problems facing the Islamic World. Faraj argued that modern Muslims had specifically neglected jihad, which he placed after the five pillars as the most important aspect of Islam. Faraj also had very specific views on what form this jihad should take. He followed Sayyid Qutb in arguing that jihad was a fard al-ayn (an individual duty incumbent upon every Muslim).Gerges, The far enemy, 2010: 10 He dismissed the notion that inner spiritual struggle was the greater jihad as a fabricated tradition, and emphasised the role of armed combat.Kenny, p53 The primary targets for jihad should be local regimes, Faraj taught. He coined the term \\"near enemy\\" to describe such targets, in contrast to \\"far enemies\\" such as Israel. He built on Qutb's idea that modern Islamic societies represented jahiliyyah (the state of ignorance that pervaded in the pre-Islamic Arab world) and used the ideas of ibn Taymiyyah to blame this on modern \\"apostate\\" Islamic rulers.Sageman, Understanding Terror Networks, 2004: 15 He believed that peaceful means could never bring about a truly Islamic society and so jihad was the only option. He also believed that an Islamic state should be established in Egypt before attempting to reliberate lost Muslim lands.Sageman, Understanding Terror Networks, 2004: 16 He felt jihad under the banner of an existing Arab nation would simply strengthen that country's impious rulers who were, in any case, responsible for the colonial presence in Muslim lands.Gerges, The far enemy, 2010: 11 =The Neglected Duty= After the assassination of President Sadat the Egyptian police found a document titled Al-Farida al-gha'iba (The Neglected Duty), penned by Abd al-Salam Faraj, which was published serially after its discovery. The work showed the evolution of radical Islamist ideas since Qutb's Islamist manifesto Milestones. While Qutb felt that jihad was a proclamation of \\"liberation for humanity\\", Faraj maintained with absolute certainty that jihad would enable Muslims to rule the world and to reestablish the caliphate.Cook, David, Understanding Jihad by David Cook, University of California Press, 2005 (p.107) On the importance of fighting the near enemy before the far enemy: > Muslim blood will be shed in order to realize this victory [over Israel]. > Now it must be asked whether this victory will benefit the interest of > Infidel rule? It will mean the strengthening of a state which rebels against > the Laws of God [the shari'ah] ... These rulers will take advantage of the > nationalist ideas of these Muslims in order to realize their un-Islamic > aims, even though at the surface [these aims] look Islamic. Fighting has to > be done [only] under the Banner of Islam and under Islamic leadership. Faraj believed it was the Muslim's responsibility to fight, but that ultimately, (based on Qur'an 9:14) supernatural divine intervention would provide the victory: > This means that a Muslim has first of all the duty to execute the command to > fight with his own hands. [Once he has done so] God will then intervene [and > change] the laws of nature. In this way victory will be achieved through the > hands of the believers by means of God's [intervention]. Much of the rest of The Neglected Duty is taken up with discussions concerning Islamically legitimate methods of fighting. Among these are deceiving the enemy, lying to him, attacking by night (even if it leads to accidentally killing innocents), and felling and burning trees of the infidel.Faraj, al- Farida al-gha'iba, (Amman, n.d.), p.28, 26; trans. Johannes Jansen, The Neglected Duty, (New York, 1986)Cook, David, Understanding Jihad by David Cook, University of California Press, 2005 p.192, 190 =Motivation for killing Sadat= After killing Sadat, his assassin (a member of al-Jihad) announced: 'I have killed Pharaoh! I am not afraid to die.' This surprised some in the Western world who assumed that \\"Sadat's offense in the eyes of the murderers was making peace with Israel\\" and would be called a Jewish agent or something similar, rather than a Pharaoh. But Abd al-Salam Faraj explained at his trial that he and his group were interested in instituting Shariah law, not fighting Zionism or imperialism: > The basis of the existence of imperialism in the lands of Islam is these > self-same rulers. To begin with the struggle against imperialism is a work > which is neither glorious nor useful, and it is only a waste of time. It is > our duty to concentrate on our Islamic cause, and that is the establishment > first of all of God's law in our own country and causing the world of God to > prevail. There is no doubt that the first battlefield of the jihad is the > extirpation of these infidel leaderships and their replacement by a perfect > Islamic order, and from this will come the release of our energies. Lewis, > Bernard, The Crisis of Islam : Holy War and Unholy Terror, 2003 by Bernard > Lewis, p.135, source: \`Abd al-Salam Farq, Al-Jihad: al Farida al-Gha'iba > (Amman, 1982); English translation in Johannes J.G. Jansen, The Neglected > Duty: The Creed of Sadat's Assassins and Islamic Resurgence in the Middle > East (New York, 1986), pp.159 ff. Influence Faraj failed in the near term. He did not have a sufficiently robust network and could not capitalise on the assassination of Sadat. In conjunction with the assassination, Tanzim al-Jihad began an insurrection in Asyut in Upper Egypt. Rebels took control of the city for a few days starting 8 October 1981, before paratroopers from Cairo restored government control. 68 policemen and soldiers were killed in the fighting.Sageman, Understanding Terror Networks, 2004: 33,4 Nevertheless, Faraj's pamphlet The neglected obligation was a highly influential text. Faraj probably wrote his ideas down in 1979, although it was initially only distributed among his followers. The ideas contained in it guided Egyptian Islamist extremist groups throughout the 1980s and 90s. Ayman al-Zawahiri was Faraj's friend and followed his mantra of targeting the near enemy for many years. Some writers have criticised Faraj. Jad al-Haq of the al-Azhar University dismissed his declaration of Sadat as an apostate and had misinterpreted parts of the Qur'an, including the sword verse.Calvert, p286 Others have questioned Faraj's religious credentials, pointing out that he trained as an electrician rather than as an Islamic jurist.Eikmeier, p93 References Bibliography * Calvert, John, Sayyid Qutb and the Origins of Radical Islamism * Eikmeier, Dale C., Qutbism: An Ideology of Islamic-Fascism * Kenny, Joseph, Philosophy of the Muslim World * Salama, Sammy and Bergoch, Joe-Ryan, Al-Jihad al-Islami * Stanley, Trevor, Muhammad Abd al-Salam Faraj: Founder of Jama'at Al-Jihad, the group that killed Anwar Sadat * * Category:Egyptian Islamic Jihad Category:Cairo University alumni Category:Egyptian Salafis Category:Executed Egyptian people Category:20th-century executions by Egypt Category:1954 births Category:1982 deaths Category:People from Beheira Governorate Category:Egyptian revolutionaries Category:Leaders of Islamic terror groups Category:Salafi jihadists ","title":"Muhammad abd-al-Salam Faraj"},{"id":"29586667","text":"Michael Berrer, the defending champion, did not participate.

When seen from below by a predator, the animal's light helps to match its brightness and colour to the sea surface above. Counter- illumination is a method of active camouflage seen in marine animals such as firefly squid and midshipman fish, and in military prototypes, producing light to match their backgrounds in both brightness and wavelength. Marine animals of the mesopelagic (mid-water) zone tend to appear dark against the bright water surface when seen from below. They can camouflage themselves, often from predators but also from their prey, by producing light with bioluminescent photophores on their downward-facing surfaces, reducing the contrast of their silhouettes against the background. The light may be produced by the animals themselves, or by symbiotic bacteria, often Aliivibrio fischeri. Counter- illumination differs from countershading, which uses only pigments such as melanin to reduce the appearance of shadows. It is one of the dominant types of aquatic camouflage, along with transparency and silvering. All three methods make animals in open water resemble their environment. Counter- illumination has not so far come into widespread military use, but during the Second World War it was trialled in ships in the Canadian Diffused lighting camouflage project, and in aircraft in the American Yehudi lights project.  In marine animals  =Mechanism= Counter-illumination and countershading In the sea, counter-illumination is one of three dominant methods of underwater camouflage, the other two being transparency and silvering. Among marine animals, especially crustaceans, cephalopods, and fish, counter-illumination camouflage occurs where bioluminescent light from photophores on an organism's ventral surface is matched to the light radiating from the environment. The bioluminescence is used to obscure the organism's silhouette produced by the down-welling light. Counter-illumination differs from countershading, also used by many marine animals, which uses pigments to darken the upper side of the body while the underside is as light as possible with pigment, namely white. Countershading fails when the light falling on the animal's underside is too weak to make it appear roughly as bright as the background. This commonly occurs when the background is the relatively bright ocean surface, and the animal is swimming in the mesopelagic depths of the sea. Counter-illumination goes further than countershading, actually brightening the underside of the body. Photophores Photophores on a lanternfish, the most common deep sea fish worldwide Counter-illumination relies on organs that produce light, photophores. These are roughly spherical structures that appear as luminous spots on many marine animals, including fish and cephalopods. The organ can be simple, or as complex as the human eye, equipped with lenses, shutters, colour filters and reflectors. Sagittal section of the large eye-like light-producing organ of Hawaiian bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes. The organ houses symbiotic Aliivibrio fischeri bacteria. In the Hawaiian bobtail squid (Euprymna scolopes) light is produced in a large and complex two-lobed light organ inside the squid's mantle cavity. At the top of the organ (dorsal side) is a reflector, directing the light downwards. Below this are containers (crypts) lined with epithelium containing light- producing symbiotic bacteria. Below those is a kind of iris, consisting of branches (diverticula) of its ink sac; and below that is a lens. Both the reflector and the lens are derived from mesoderm. Light escapes from the organ downwards, some of it travelling directly, some coming off the reflector. Some 95% of the light-producing bacteria are voided at dawn every morning; the population in the light organ then builds up slowly during the day to a maximum of some 1012 bacteria by nightfall: this species hides in sand away from predators during the day, and does not attempt counter-illumination during daylight, which would in any case require much brighter light than its light organ output. The emitted light shines through the skin of the squid's underside. To reduce light production, the squid can change the shape of its iris; it can also adjust the strength of yellow filters on its underside, which presumably change the balance of wavelengths emitted. The light production is correlated with the intensity of down-welling light but about one third as bright; the squid is able to track repeated changes in brightness. Matching light intensity and wavelength At night, nocturnal organisms match both the wavelength and the light intensity of their bioluminescence to that of the down-welling moonlight and direct it downward as they swim, to help them remain unnoticed by any observers below. Spectrum of visible light showing colours at different wavelengths, in nanometres In the eyeflash squid (Abralia veranyi) a species which daily migrates between the surface and deep waters, a study showed that the light produced is bluer in cold waters and greener in warmer waters, temperature serving as a guide to the required emission spectrum. The animal has more than 550 photophores on its underside, consisting of rows of four to six large photophores running across the body, and many smaller photophores scattered over the surface. In cold water at 11 Celsius, the squid's photophores produced a simple (unimodal) spectrum with its peak at 490 nanometres (blue-green). In warmer water at 24 Celsius, the squid added a weaker emission (forming a shoulder on the side of the main peak) at around 440 nanometres (blue), from the same group of photophores. Other groups remained unilluminated: other species, and perhaps A. veranyi from its other groups of photophores, can produce a third spectral component when needed. Another squid, Abralia trigonura, is able to produce three spectral components: at 440 and at 536 nanometres (green), appearing at 25 Celsius, apparently from the same photophores; and at 470‚Äì480 nanometres (blue-green), easily the strongest component at 6 Celsius, apparently from a different group of photophores. Many species can in addition vary the light they emit by passing it through a choice of colour filters. Counterillumination camouflage halved predation among individuals employing it compared to those not employing it in the midshipman fish Porichthys notatus. Diagram of a small type of photophore in the skin of a cephalopod, Abralia trigonura, in vertical section Autogenic or bacteriogenic bioluminescence The bioluminescence used for counter-illumination can be either autogenic (produced by the animal itself, as in pelagic cephalopods such as Vampyroteuthis, Stauroteuthis, and pelagic octopuses in the Bolitaenidae) or bacteriogenic (produced by bacterial symbionts). The luminescent bacterium is often Aliivibrio fischeri, as for example in the Hawaiian bobtail squid. =Purpose= Photophores on a nocturnal midshipman fish, whose bioluminescence halves its rate of predation Hiding from predators Reducing the silhouette is primarily an anti-predator defence for mesopelagic (mid-water) organisms. The reduction of the silhouette from highly directional down-welling light is important, since there is no refuge in the open water, and predation occurs from below.Young. R.E; Roper. C.F.E. 1976. Bioluminescent countershading in Midwater Animals from living Squid. Science, New Series. Vol 191,4231: 1046-1048. Many mesopelagic cephalopods such as the firefly squid (Watasenia scintillans), decapod crustaceans, and deep ocean fishes use counter-illumination; it works best for them when ambient light levels are low, leaving the diffuse down-welling light from above as the only light source. Hiding from prey Besides its effectiveness as a predator avoidance mechanism, counter-illumination also serves as an essential tool to predators themselves. Some shark species, such as the deepwater velvet belly lanternshark (Etmopterus spinax), use counter- illumination to remain hidden from their prey. Other well-studied examples include the cookiecutter shark (Isistius brasiliensis), the marine hatchetfish, and the Hawaiian bobtail squid. More than 10% of shark species may be bioluminescent, though some such as lantern sharks may use the light for signalling as well as for camouflage. =Defeating counter-illumination camouflage= An animal camouflaged by counter-illumination is not completely invisible. A predator could resolve individual photophores on a camouflaged prey's underside, given sufficiently acute vision, or it could detect the remaining difference in brightness between the prey and the background. Predators with a visual acuity of 0.11 degrees (of arc) would be able to detect individual photophores of the Madeira lanternfish Ceratoscopelus maderensis at up to , and they would be able to see the general layout of the photophore clusters with poorer visual acuity. Much the same applies also to A. veranyi, but it was largely given away by its unlit fins and tentacles, which appear dark against the background from as far away as . All the same, the counter-illumination camouflage of these species is extremely effective, radically reducing their detectability.  Military prototypes  Active camouflage in the form of counter-illumination has rarely been used for military purposes, but it has been prototyped in ship and aircraft camouflage from the Second World War onwards. =For ships= Diffused lighting camouflage prototype, not quite complete and set to maximum brightness, installed on HMS Largs in 1942 Diffused lighting camouflage, in which visible light is projected on to the sides of ships to match the faint glow of the night sky, was trialled by Canada's National Research Council from 1941 onwards, and then by the Royal Navy, during the Second World War. Some 60 light projectors were mounted all around the hull and on the ships' superstructure such as the bridge and funnels. On average, the system reduced the distance at which a ship could be seen from a surfaced submarine by 25% using binoculars, or by 33% using the naked eye. The camouflage worked best on clear moonless nights: on such a night in January 1942, HMS Largs was not seen until it closed to when counter-illuminated, but was visible at unlighted, a 57% reduction in range. =For aircraft= Mary Taylor Brush's 1917 patent application for camouflaging a Morane-Borel monoplane using light bulbs In 1916 the American artist Mary Taylor Brush experimented with camouflage on a Morane-Borel monoplane using light bulbs around the aircraft, and filed a 1917 patent that claimed she was \\"able to produce a machine which is practically invisible when in the air\\". The concept was not developed further during the First World War. Forward-pointing Yehudi lights on Grumman TBM Avenger raised the average brightness of the plane from a dark shape to the same as the sky. The Canadian ship concept was trialled in American aircraft including B-24 Liberators and TBM Avengers in the Yehudi lights project, starting in 1943, using forward-pointing lamps automatically adjusted to match the brightness of the sky. The goal was to enable a radar-equipped, sea-search aircraft to approach a surfaced submarine to within 30 seconds from arrival before being seen, to enable the aircraft to drop its depth charges before the submarine could dive. There was insufficient electrical power available to illuminate the entire surface of the aircraft, and outboard lamps in the manner of diffused lighting camouflage would have interfered with the airflow over the aircraft's surface, so a system of forward-pointing lamps was chosen. These had a beam with a radius of 3 degrees, so pilots had to fly with the aircraft's nose pointed directly at the enemy. In a crosswind, this required a curving approach path, rather than a straight-line path with the nose pointed upwind. In trials in 1945, a counter-illuminated Avenger was not seen until from its target, compared to for an uncamouflaged aircraft. The idea was revisited in 1973 when an F-4 Phantom was fitted with camouflaging lights in the \\"Compass Ghost\\" project.

By the age of five, he had seen more burning buildings and dead bodies than most Germans see in their entire lives, Maiwald says. After that, they went to Munich, till the city was evacuated. Then they went to Weilheim in Oberbayern and from there, were evacuated to Uffing, where the family lived until 1951. Although they finally had a roof over their heads, it was not an easy life because the owners of the house were forced to empty rooms to take in refugees, different families in different rooms. At school, the local children occasionally picked fights with the refugee children. At one point, his mother was nearly shot‚Äîwith Maiwald and his sister standing right there‚Äîwhen American soldiers found her with a photo of her husband, in Nazi uniform.

It was years before it was learned that he had been killed by a bomb in 1945. In the aftermath of the war, life was a daily struggle for survival, of finding food, shelter, clothing, water and fuel. Many schools were destroyed, so it was not uncommon for children to have to travel very far to go to school and when they got there, there were no books and no paper. Books were banned because of denazification, so the teacher wrote everything on a board in front of the room and the children used erasable tablets to copy everything down.

He is chosen due to his striking resemblance to Bertrand Corlay, a suspected Nazi collaborator being held prisoner by the British. At the Corlay family farm, Madame Henriette Corlay (Margaret Wycherly), Bertrand's mother, eventually realizes Matard is not her son, but does not give him away, although she disapproves of Bertrand's apparent cooperation with the Germans. Matard has better luck fooling both Anne Pinot (Susan Peters) and Elise (Signe Hasso), Bertrand's fiancee and mistress, respectively. After French Resistance contact Louis Basdevant is unmasked as a turncoat, Matard forces him at gunpoint to get him into a heavily guarded town. When the masquerade is uncovered, Matard shoots Basdevant and a German officer, and escapes by jumping in the harbor. He sees a U-boat entering a hidden pen. He gives a coded message to Plehec (William Edmunds) to transmit on his wireless, but the man is caught. Matard is also taken. Though a number of civilians refuse to betray Matard (and are shot), Plehec's young nephew Etienne (Darryl Hickman) identifies him. When Matard refuses to tell Captain Hans Holz (George Coulouris) the location of the wireless, he is tortured for days. Schoolteacher and Resistance member Jean Kerenor (Richard Whorf) and other villagers manage to free him. Hidden in a secret room beneath the church, Matard is nursed back to health by Anne Pinot. Knowing his true identity, she admits she loves him, much to his delight. Etienne shows up, telling Matard that his uncle had instructed him to do whatever he had to in order to protect the wireless. The boy takes Matard to it; Matard sends the location to his superiors. A commando raid is organized, led by Colonel Trane (Reginald Owen). On the way to rendezvous with the British, Matard and Kerenor stumble upon Elise and Holz in each other's arms. Furious that he had defended Elise from the charge of collaboration all this time, Kerenor kills them both. After they depart, Madame Corlay arrives, attracted by the sound of gunfire. When she hears German soldiers approach, she grabs the pistol and allows herself to be captured to shield the others. Matard joins some of the soldiers in the assault on the control room. Becoming trapped inside, they are rescued by Kerenor, who attacks the Germans from behind. Though he is killed, the others succeed in blowing up the sub pens. The commandos re-embark on their boats. Aboard, Matard finds Anne and Etienne. Cast * Jean-Pierre Aumont as Capt. Pierre Matard / Bertrand Corlay * Susan Peters as Anne Pinot * Margaret Wycherly as Mme.

As with some other Ukrainian ultralights, e.g. the Lilienthal Bekas, agricultural spraying was seen as a possible role, but no further aircraft appear to have been built. An enlarged version, the RSM-25 Bekas, has been considered.

It stars Van Johnson and June Allyson, in the third of their six screen pairings. The screenplay based on the novel High Barbaree (1945) by authors Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall. The real-life drama of the Consolidated PBY Catalina aircraft in the Pacific theater was merged into a search for a mystical \\"High Barbaree\\".\\"\\"High Barbaree\\". Allmovie. Retrieved: September 16, 2012. Plot In Hawaii, during World War II, U.S. Navy pilot Alec Brooke (Van Johnson) commands a flying boat, named the \\"High Barbaree\\". During a bombing mission against a Japanese submarine, his PBY Catalina is shot down with all but one of his crew killed, but still able to stay afloat, adrift far from Allied territory. While the crippled aircraft is slowly floating, the two survivors hear the voice of \\"Tokyo Rose\\" (Audrey Totter) invoking memories of their past. Alec shares a series of recollections with fellow survivor, Lt. Joe Moore (Cameron Mitchell). His memories concern his boyhood sweetheart in a small Iowa town, Nancy Fraser (June Allyson), now a Navy nurse serving on a ship in the Pacific theater, commanded by his uncle, Capt. Thad Vail (Thomas Mitchell). Alec and Moore now convert the flying boat into a sailboat by lashing up parachutes as a sail, and head for High Barbaree, a mythical island that his uncle claimed to have once seen in fact. As water supplies dwindle and both men begin to succumb to the conditions, Alec continues his story of a childhood where he had dreamed of becoming a doctor like his father (Henry Hull). After completing the first two years of medical training, he had chosen to become a pilot and rose to the ranks of vice-president of the Case Aviation company, even winning the hand of the boss's daughter (Marilyn Maxwell). When Nancy comes back for a visit, a terrible tornado destroys the company and town, and because his father suffers a broken arm, Alec takes over the emergency medical care of the victims that are in the town auditorium. Nancy, dismayed at his engagement to another woman and his choice of career, leaves as soon as the airport reopens; they lose contact and Alec cannot tell her that he has rethought both decisions. The coming of war precludes Alec continuing his medical career, and as a pilot in the highly specialized PBY flying boats that harass the Japanese fleets, he is particularly successful until his last mission. After Joe dies, and Alec goes into a coma, High Barbaree seems only a dream when rescue comes at the last moment, as his uncle steers to the location he had once charted and finds Alec. On board, Nancy and the recovering Alec are finally reunited. Cast * Van Johnson as Alec Brooke * June Allyson as Nancy Frazier * Thomas Mitchell as Capt.

Production After a period of inactivity for Van Johnson where he had brooded about his decision not to enlist in World War II, the studio cast him with one of his favorite co-stars, June Allyson, who had been a close friend ever since the pair had performed on Broadway and had been budding stars in Hollywood. Other principal roles such as the father, mother and uncle were ably cast by Hollywood veterans while the significant role of the young Alec was handled by Claude Jarman Jr., the star of The Yearling (1946).Quin, Elanor. \\"Articles: High Barabee.\\" Turner Classic Movies.

Kirby. Set in a fictional coastal city in the late nineteenth century, it follows three children: Giuseppe, Hannah, and Frederick who work to solve each other's problems. Origins The idea for The Clockwork Three came to Kirby when he read a story of a boy named Joseph in a newspaper from 1873. Joseph had been kidnapped from Italy and had to play a fiddle in English streets to earn money for his master, until he eventually escaped. Plot One day, Giuseppe finds a green violin floating in the harbor and he tries it out. He finds that it gives a very beautiful sound, and he is thrown money from people everywhere in the streets. He gets an idea to use his green violin to get a boat ticket back to Italy where he had been taken from. For once, Giuseppe has hope in getting back to his family. Frederick is going around in search of a chest plate for his clockwork man. While wandering the streets, Frederick catches a glimpse of Mrs. Treeless, the woman in charge of an orphanage. Frederick had been in before becoming apprenticed to Master Branch, which reminds him of the awful memories he had at the orphanage. He also bumps into Giuseppe, but Giuseppe runs along with his violin. Later, he finds a coal chute, perfect for the chest plate, and sneaks it out of a coal yard. While he sneaks out, he lies about his father being O'Malley. He goes back to Master Branch's shop, where Frederick is an apprentice, and once he decides that Master Branch is asleep, he goes to the basement of the shop to work on his clockwork man. Hannah discovers that a man named Mister Stroop supposedly left the treasure in the suites at the top of the hotel. She later sees a map that hints it may be near a pond in the park. She runs to look for it when she desperately needs money for her sick father's medicine. There she meets Giuseppe, and the two look for the treasure but it is not there, though she receives some herbal medicine from a woman who lives in the park. Hannah's father draws for her where the treasure is hidden in the hotel, having worked for Stroop's hotel in the past. The next day the three children all meet for the first time and Frederick shows the other two his automaton. The three agree to help each other out with their problems. Giuseppe mentions that he saw a clockwork head‚ÄîFrederick's only missing piece‚Äîin a museum. The three sneak into the museum so Frederick can inspect the head, but they are interrupted by guards and forced to flee. Frederick escapes with the stolen head, which was made by Albertus Magnus. Hannah also accidentally took a small piece of clay belonging to a golem and inserts it into the Clockwork Man thus bringing the Clockwork Man to life. This, coupled with the Magnus head, gives it near-human intelligence. Hannah discovers that Mister Stroop's treasure is his will, witnessed by the hotel's owner, Mister Twine. She and Frederick talk to him, but Hannah refuses to take the money because it would cause the park to be destroyed. Mister Twine promotes her to the chief of maids and gives her quite a bit of money for new dresses, a portion of which she gives to Giuseppe for his ticket. A law was passed that the padrones no longer had legal control over their buskers. Enraged, Stefano tries to kill Giuseppe, but he is saved by Yakov, who shoots Stephano in the head with his gun. Madame Pomeroy asks Giuseppe to travel with her to play his green violin for kings and queens, and thus, Giuseppe accepts. Frederick eventually becomes a journeyman, and Hannah's father's health improves. The story ends with an epilogue in which Frederick has created a clockwork bird and shows it to Hannah. It begins to hum a tune that Giuseppe played on his violin, and Hannah's father's toes begin to tap, showing that his leg still works. Characters *Giuseppe is an eleven-year-old boy who has lived in America for six years. His parents are dead, but his siblings still live in Italy. He keeps a stash of money in a graveyard to save up for a ticket to Italy that he finds from a green violin. *Hannah is a twelve-year- old girl who had to abandon school to work as a maid in a hotel. She loves reading and used to own seven books, but had to sell six of them. She has two very young twin sisters, a mother, and a father who used to be a fine stonemason but is currently sick with apoplexy and in need of help. Hannah became Madame Pomeroy's personal assistant. It is hinted she has feelings for Frederick. *Frederick is a thirteen-year-old apprentice clockmaker who wishes to work on his own. His father died and his mother left him due to illness when he was young and he spent time in an orphanage before a clockmaker discovered his talent and employed him as an apprentice. He is secretly building an automaton and hopes it will promote him to his own business. He seems to feel nervous around Hannah and possibly has a crush on her. *Madame Pomeroy is a large woman who employed Hannah as her personal assistant after Miss Wool lost her temper and yelled at her, thus saving Hannah from being fired. She is quite rich and is thought to be able to communicate with the dead. *Yakov is Madame Pomeroy's Russian bodyguard. He is considered her \\"golem\\" and has a gift of telling the future. He owns a gun in the shape of a leaping tiger. *Stephano is Giuseppe's abusive padrone. *Master Branch is the clockmaker who employed Frederick as an apprentice. He greatly cares for Frederick and sticks up for him. *Pietro is a small boy who had trouble making money for Stephano by playing his tin whistle. Giuseppe begins to care for him. He ends up under the care of Reverend Grey. *Miss Wool is a woman who is chief of the maids at the hotel. She is after the treasure and shows Hannah no mercy. She is fired at the end by the hotel's manager, Mister Twine, and Hannah is offered her position. Critical reception Publishers Weekly gave The Clockwork Three a starred review, saying \\"debut novelist Kirby has assembled all the ingredients for a rousing adventure, which he delivers with rich, transporting prose.\\" The website Kidsreads also gave the book a positive review, saying \\"With plenty of steampunk elements and more than a few hints of violence, The Clockwork Three is, in many ways, as dark and menacing as its hard-edged setting.\\" Another review came from Deseret News, praising the imagery. Kirkus Reviews was more mixed, calling it \\"an interesting concept\\" but thought the ending was too obvious and the children became less interesting as the story went along.

He was a Boston politician and foundry owner and in his firm he cast the first life-size bronze statue in the United States. Biography Born in Manchester, Massachusetts to Captain William and Sally Northey Hooper, he descended from a line of Northey silversmiths of Salem, Gloucester, and Manchester, MA, and the Hooper family of shipmasters. Hooper initially produced nautical equipment, in which field he was educated and worked until 1825.Pope and Hooper ‚ÄúHooper Genealogy\\" He was an apprentice of Paul Revere in the latter‚Äôs Boston foundry. He later purchased the foundry and established Henry N. Hooper & Co. to produce lamps and lighting fixtures, bells, and by 1862, artillery for the Union Army. Hooper was probably best known as a manufacturer of fine decorative lighting fixtures, including chandeliers, girandoles, Argand lamps, and other cast and gilt bronze lighting. He was commissioned by the U.S. Congress to manufacture a massive chandelier for the Hall of the House of Representatives, which was hung in December 1840. The lighted 13-foot diameter, whale-oil burning fixture, weighing 7,500 lb, was described by witnesses as ‚Äúexceedingly beautiful and extremely brilliant‚Äù and ‚Äúwithout exception, the largest, most elegant, and splendid chandelier we ever beheld.‚Äù At a cost of $4,000, it featured over 10,000 cut glass pieces and 78 burners, with all of its visible metal parts finished in gold.Hazard Hazard‚Äôs Statistical Register However, only a day after its first lighting, the massive chandelier fell to the floor owing to a defective suspension chain, destroying several desks and chairs and itself in the process. One person was injured, but fortunately, Congress was not in session. A committee investigating the incident exonerated Hooper of blame, and the chandelier ultimately was replaced with a gas model. Other chandeliers of Hooper's are displayed in the library of the Longfellow House‚ÄìWashington's Headquarters National Historic Site and are in the Metropolitan Museum of Art collections, while specimens of his Rococo Revival candelabras, Argand lamps, and candlesticks survive in private collections. Replicas of his solar chandeliers have recently been commissioned. Hooper was also well known for his highly prized bells and chimes dating from 1838. His many clients included the City of San Francisco fire department and the Monhegan, ME, lighthouse, whose bell, now on display at the Monhegan Museum, became the subject of the Jamie Wyeth painting, ‚ÄúBronze Age‚Äù. His Boston foundry yard, the scene of construction of chimes for Christ Church in Cambridge, MA, were featured in a sketch by Winslow Homer for Harper's Weekly in 1860. Today, his bells are still found in churches, courthouses, and universities, mainly in New England. Notable examples include: *Restoration Community Church, 211 Main St., Kingston, MA (1852) *Savage United Methodist Church, MD (1838) *Pinewood Lutheran Church, Burlington, MA (1846) *Town Hall Bell Tower, Plymouth, NH (1849) *Nashua Baptist Church, Nashua, NH (1854) *San Joaquin County Courthouse, Stockton, CA (1855) (On display at The Haggin Museum, Stockton, CA) *First Congregational Church, 115 So.

Hooper's company was one of 5 contracted by the Union Army to produce the Napoleon, a 6 ft., 1200 lb bronze field gun that was the most popular smoothbore artillery in the Civil War. Hooper's firm was the second leading supplier of the Revere Copper Company, supplying about one- third of the 1,156 Napoleons made for the North. Over 100 of Hooper‚Äôs guns survive, with some on display at Gettysburg, Arlington National Cemetery, and in the Rhode Island State House. He cast the first life-sized bronze statue in the U.S., of Nathaniel Bowditch, the ‚Äúfather of modern maritime navigation‚Äù which was placed at Mount Auburn Cemetery, Cambridge, MA. The casting was later replaced in 1886. Hooper was active in Boston politics, serving on the Boston City Council in 1841, and as a Representative to the General Court. He was president of the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association, a position previously held by Paul Revere. He married Priscilla Langdon Harris of Boston in 1826. Hooper‚Äôs sons, Henry Northey and Isaac Harris Hooper, both served as officers in the Civil War. His brother, William Northey Hooper, was a merchant and a principal founder of the sugar industry in Hawaii. Hooper died in Roxbury, MA, in 1865.

It is named after former Governor of Oklahoma George Nigh, who appointed the Commission. Under the leadership of Chairman Walter Allison of Bartlesville, Oklahoma, the Commission issued its final report and recommendations to Governor Nigh on November 1, 1984. Background Governor Nigh, on February 1, 1984, issued Executive Order 84-1, which established the Commission. The Commission was composed of one hundred members, all volunteers, representing twenty separate business and professional fields from all areas of the State. Governor Nigh pledged the full support of the executive branch to the Commission, with the Oklahoma Legislature later passing resolutions also supporting the work of the Commission. The Commission began operations on February 9, 1984. The Commission was neither funded or supported by the State government: it generated its own funds, provided its own office space and administrative support. No active member of the executive, legislative, or judicial branches was allowed to serve on the Commission in order to ensure an honest inspection of the State government. The Commission divided itself into nine Study Committees: *Administrative Services, Personnel Management and Purchasing Committee *Agriculture, Business and Economic Development Committee *Education Committee *Government Structure Committee *Health and Human Services Committee *Natural, Cultural and Historical Resources Committee *Public Safety, Defense and Law Enforcement Committee *Revenue, Taxation and Financial Management Committee *Transportation Committee Each of the Study Committees was assigned responsibility for reviewing a list of State agencies with related functions. The Study Committees meet numerous times between February and September, 1984. During their meetings, agency personnel, elected officials, representatives of various groups and organizations and other individuals met with the Study Committees. Each Committee submitted its own report to the full Commission, which then meet in October to review and accept or reject each recommendation. The Commission submitted its final report to Governor Nigh on November 1, 1984, at such times it ceased operations. Recommendations The Commission recommended several hundred recommendations to improve the operations of State government. Several of these recommendations have since been implemented, but several others (as of 2010) have not. =Governmental structure= The Governmental Structure Study Committee recommended a major reorganization of the agencies, board, commission and departments into a Cabinet-type government for the executive branch. The Cabinet should consist of the following agencies: *Department of Administrative Services *Department of Commerce and Agriculture *Department of Education *Department of Health and Human Services *Department of Natural, Cultural and Recreational Resources *Department of Public Safety and Law Enforcement *Department of Transportation The Committee recommended that the Legislature reduce its administrative and staff organizations by establishing a single joint administrative office. The judicial branch, as recommended by the Committee, should be more efficiently handle its caseload with existing staff. Additionally, district court boundaries should be improved and provide for greater flexibility in assigning judges. The Committee noted that the basic structure of county government in the State has remained unchanged since statehood in 1907. The Committee recommended that county government be provided with greater efficiency and flexibility for management. =Finances= The Revenue, Taxation and Financial Management Study Committee did develop specific recommendations for greater efficiency. However, no specific recommendations were made involving a \\"flat tax\\" on income, a tax on non-producing minerals, and measure to assure the collect of personal property taxes. =Public health= The Health and Human Services Study Committee recognized that there were many health and human services programs, with many of these programs being the result of New Deal programs. The Committee found that the management of these programs involves the same complexities of a large business enterprise and recommended major improvements in the structure and management of those programs. =Administrative services= The Administrative Services, Personnel Management and Purchasing Study Committee reviewed its assigned agencies and found most of them to operate efficiently and effectively. The Committee recommended several changes that would improve efficiency and result in tax savings. Some of these recommendations involved establishing a unified control where none currently exist. Other recommendations involved removing unjust and unfair favoritism in personnel procedures and benefits. =Economic development= The Agriculture, Business and Economic Development Study Committee focused on recommendations to improve the environment for productive economic enterprises. The Committee made recommendations to abolish or alleviate state policies which discourage business investment and recommended policies to stimulate growth. =Public safety= The Public Safety, Defense and Law Enforcement Study Committee reviewed thirteen boards, bureaus, and departments. Several items were discovered: *On the whole, each agency appeared to function smoothly and appropriately performed their duties *All individuals who appeared before the Committee were knowledgeable about their respective agency *Tremendous opportunity exists for agency consolidation and sharing of support services *Most agency representatives stressed the unique aspects of their agencies and denied the existence of overlap and redundancy *Most agencies strongly resisted any suggestion that services might improve or savings might result from consolidation or sharing of support services *Few agencies had developed long-range plans The Committee found that most agencies operated without regard for how it might operate more efficiently or effectively. Additionally, most agencies showed a narrowness and \\"empire building\\" mentality in their management structure. The Committee recommended that most, if not all, of the State's public safety and law enforcement agencies be consolidated into one to three \\"super-agencies\\" reporting to a single Cabinet-level position under the Governor. During, and until, such consolidation, the Committee made various recommendations on internal agency improvements. =Education= The Education Study Committee divided itself into three Subcommittees: *Elementary and Secondary Schools *Vocational- Technical Education *Higher Education The Committee, as a whole, recommended greater accountability for all educational levels. In particular, greater financial accountability and greater accountability from educational professionals. A general recommendation for greater coordination among education activities was made by the Committee, particularly be establishing a single Department of Education under a Cabinet Secretary answerable directly to the Governor. Area specific recommendations being made for each educational-level activity. =Natural Resources= The Natural, Cultural and Historical Resources Study Committee identified four general problems for the agencies it reviewed: *Lack of communication among agency heads *Problems with direct lines of communications with the Governor and Legislature *Redundancy in programs *Problems with personnel under the Merit System The Committee found that intra-agency efficiency, staffing and funding needs for the examined agencies was difficult under the current organizational structure. Each agency depended on its appointed board members to communicate with the Governor and Legislature. The Committee recommended that a Department of Natural, Cultural and Recreational Resources be established and assume the functions currently performed by existing agencies. The new Department would be headed by a Cabinet Secretary answerable directly to the Governor. The new Department would reduce costs, provide for better coordination and ensure better control by the Governor. In new Department, the Committee recommended the retention of citizen boards currently in use. These boards would continue to serve in an advisory capacity to the Department. The Cabinet Secretary would serve as a voting member of each board related to the new Department. =Transportation= The Transportation Study Committee commented on the growing need for more funding to transportation activities in the State. The Committee gave praise to the efforts of former Governor David L. Boren to consolidate the State's transportation activities into a single entity in the Oklahoma Department of Transportation. Previously, transportation was handled by the Railroad Maintenance Authority, the Highway Safety Coordinating Committee, the Aeronautics Commission and the Highway Department. Under Board, these agencies were consolidated into the Department of Transportation. The Commission recommended further consolidation by merging the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority into the Transportation Department. Though concerns were initially voiced over the purchasing process used for transportation construction materials, the Committee ultimately found that the current process of centralized purchasing achieved favorable results and did not make any recommendation to reform it.

It was formed in December 1943 at Batchelor, Northern Territory, as part of North-Western Area Command. Led by Group Captain Charles Eaton, the wing comprised four squadrons on its establishment, flying Beaufort and B-25 Mitchell bombers and Beaufighter heavy fighters. No. 79 Wing took part in the New Guinea and North-Western Area Campaigns during 1944‚Äì45, eventually transferring to Balikpapan in the Dutch East Indies as the Allies advanced northward. By the end of the Pacific War, the wing was attached to the Australian First Tactical Air Force and was made up of Nos. 2 and 18 (Netherlands East Indies) Squadrons, both flying Mitchells. The latter transferred to the Netherlands Air Force in late 1945, while the former returned to Australia where it disbanded the following year. No. 79 Headquarters itself disbanded in October 1945, soon after the end of hostilities. History Group Captain Eaton (pictured in 1941), inaugural commander of No. 79 Wing No. 79 Wing was established at Batchelor, Northern Territory, on 30 November 1943. Its combat units consisted of Nos. 1 and 2 Squadrons (flying Beaufort light reconnaissance bombers), No. 31 Squadron (Beaufighter long-range fighters), and No. 18 (Netherlands East Indies) Squadron (B-25 Mitchell medium bombers). The wing was commanded by Group Captain Charles Eaton, whose Dutch personnel called him \\"Oom Charles\\" (Uncle Charles).Farram, Charles \\"Moth\\" Eaton, p. 38Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 215‚Äì218 Operating under the auspices of North-Western Area Command (NWA), Darwin, No. 79 Wing participated in the New Guinea and North-Western Area Campaigns during 1944. Through March‚ÄìApril 1944, the Beaufighters attacked Japanese shipping, while the Mitchells and Beauforts bombed Timor on a daily basis as a prelude to Operations Reckless and Persecution, the invasions of Hollandia and Aitape. Eaton organised a large raid against Su, Dutch Timor, on 19 April. Consisting of thirty-five Mitchells, Beauforts and Beaufighters, the force destroyed the town's barracks and fuel dumps, a result that earned the personal congratulations of the Air Officer Commanding NWA, Air Vice Marshal \\"King\\" Cole.Farram, Charles \\"Moth\\" Eaton, pp. 48‚Äì49 On the day of the Allied landings, 22 April, the Mitchells and Beaufighters made a daylight raid on Dili, Portuguese Timor. The ground assault on Hollandia‚ÄìAitape met little opposition, credited in part to the air bombardment leading up to it. Aircrew and Beaufighter of No. 31 Squadron in the Northern Territory, January 1943 In May 1944, Nos. 1, 18 and 31 Squadrons attacked Japanese positions in Timor, while No. 2 Squadron was withdrawn from combat to re-equip with Mitchells. No. 79 Wing's light and medium bombers suffered from a lack of suitable targets as they had few airfields in forward areas from which to refuel. No. 2 Squadron returned to operations with Mitchells in June. That month, No. 18 Squadron flew 149 sorties, damaging Japanese airfields and shipping in the Timor area, but lost its commanding officer to anti-aircraft fire during a raid.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 228‚Äì233 In June‚ÄìJuly 1944, No. 79 Wing supported the Allied attack on Noemfoor. No. 18 Squadron was again the wing's most active unit, flying 107 sorties. In September, the Beaufighters and Mitchells attacked Japanese shipping and infrastructure in Ceram and Celebes, but lost nine aircraft and twenty-six crewmen killed, among them Squadron Leader Wilbur Wackett, son of Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation manager Lawrence Wackett.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 243‚Äì247Johnston, Whispering Death, pp. 16, 160, 396 By the end of the month, Mitchell missions were put on hold while replacement crews were trained. In late 1944, plans were made to transfer No. 79 Wing from North-Western Area Command to Northern Command in Papua New Guinea, where it would undertake operations against the Japanese in New Britain. The wing's composition for this move was to be Nos. 2 and 18 Squadrons, operating Mitchells, and 120 (Netherlands East Indies) Squadron, operating P-40 Kittyhawks. No. 31 Squadron was transferred from No. 79 Wing to the Australian First Tactical Air Force at Morotai in December.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 297‚Äì299Odgers, Air War Against Japan, p. 379 The same month, Group Captain Eaton posted out and was replaced by Group Captain John Ryland.Ryland, John Peter at Australian Dictionary of Biography. Retrieved on 18 November 2010. B-25 Mitchell bombers of No. 18 (NEI) Squadron in formation near Darwin, c. 1943 Weather hampered the wing's activities in January 1945. No. 1 Squadron was withdrawn to Queensland to re-equip with Mosquitos, with No. 13 Squadron, flying Venturas, taking up the slack on anti-shipping missions. The squadron accounted for around half of the thirty-eight enemy vessels sunk by No. 79 Wing in February, and a similar ratio to the twenty sunk the following month. Wing operations were cut back in March, as preparations were made to transfer the Mitchells to Jacquinot Bay in New Britain. On 6 April, all twenty available aircraft of Nos. 2 and 18 Squadrons were ordered to join B-24 Liberators of No. 82 Wing in an assault on a Japanese convoy that included the cruiser Isuzu. The Liberators were late for their rendezvous with the Mitchells off Sumba so the latter, at the very limit of their range, attacked the convoy regardless. They claimed two direct hits without loss, despite anti-aircraft fire from the cruiser and other ships, and frontal attacks by enemy fighters.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 402‚Äì407 Allied submarines sank the damaged Isuzu the next day.18 (NEI) Squadron RAAF at Australian War Memorial.

The series initially launched on YouTube on July 3, 2007, before moving to Walker's own site, That Guy with the Glasses, then to Channel Awesome. The show follows Walker as the title character, a bitter and sarcastic critic who mostly reviews films and television shows from his childhood and recent past, usually with comically exaggerated rage. The show often alternates the Critic's angry rants and humor with legitimate analysis of the episode's subject. Some of the films he reviewed (such as Exorcist II: The Heretic, The Garbage Pail Kids Movie, and Batman & Robin) are generally considered as the worst films ever made. Walker briefly retired the series on August 14, 2012, to work on other projects, even writing the character out of existence in the Channel Awesome film To Boldly Flee. On January 22, 2013, Walker announced the show's return in a narrative video called \\"The Review Must Go On\\". The show subsequently returned with a more narrative and sketch-driven sixth season, beginning on February 5, 2013, with a review of The Odd Life of Timothy Green. Some episodes still retain the original clip using format. History The series was initially launched on YouTube on July 3, 2007 with a review of Transformers, but episodes were frequently removed by the website following complaints of copyright infringement. In April 2008, the videos were removed from YouTube but an arrangement between the company and content host Blip in 2009 resulted in them being featured on YouTube once more. Doug Walker as the Nostalgia Critic at the ConnectiCon in 2012 The announcement of a spin-off, called The Nostalgia Chick, was created in \\"The Search for the Nostalgia Chick\\" (August 10, 2008). The concept was for a female host to review female-targeted \\"nostalgic\\" films and television. (iTunes) The contest ended in a three-way tie between Lindsay Ellis (who reviewed Disney's Pocahontas), Krissy Diggs (who reviewed Sailor Moon), and Kaylyn Saucedo (who reviewed The Last Unicorn). The competition was won by Ellis, then using the name \\"The Dudette\\", as announced on the site, \\"Nostalgia Chick Winner!\\" (September 15, 2008). Diggs and Saucedo would still join That Guy with the Glasses as That Chick with the Goggles and Marzgurl, respectively. On September 14, 2012, Walker announced the retirement of Nostalgia Critic and that it would no longer be a weekly production, as he and his brother felt that they had gone as far as they could with the series. On January 22, 2013, Walker released a sketch short film titled \\"The Review Must Go On\\", that also announced the return of the Nostalgia Critic. On December 30, 2015, Nostalgia Critic aired its 300th episode, a review of Star Wars: The Force Awakens. On October 10, 2018, Nostalgia Critic aired its 400th episode, a countdown of the top 11 Stephen King movies. Episode format The series focuses on the Nostalgia Critic, a short-tempered film reviewer looking back at films usually from his childhood and adolescence. GigaOM describes it as \\"high energy and shamelessly nerdy\\". Reuters described him as having \\"offbeat personalities\\". In each episode, the Critic restates important plot-points guiding the viewer, while making jokes out of notable or questionable scenes. The reviews are interspersed with recurring memes, false or satirical dubbing of dialogue, comedic sketches and pop culture gagssuch as making fun of famous actors who starred in lesser-known roles before their rise to fame. The show also features special episodes, such as the \\"Top 11\\" list countdowns for his favorite or least favorite films, villains, or moments in television shows; and \\"Old vs. New\\" which compares the reboot of a popular film or series to the original. Since the revival of the series in 2013, Walker occasionally produces an editorial which discusses relevant film topics; while still featuring the Critic persona, these videos are much less comedic and contain no sketches or other actors. Beginning with Jurassic World on June 23, 2015, the series also occasionally features \\"clipless reviews\\" of films that are still currently in theaters to avoid copyright infringement instead of stills and clips. These reviews instead feature scenes from the movies re-enacted comedically by Walker, his family and other Channel Awesome contributors. Walker describes his philosophy thus: \\"[We need a critic of nostalgia] because everybody already does it. When we look at movies and shows from our youth, they're rarely as good as we remember them, and oftentimes it's quite humorous to compare what you liked then to what you like now. That's basically what the Nostalgia Critic is about, looking back at just how much nostalgia cloaked our vision in heavenly bliss and how bizarre the reality is.\\" This is mostly reflected in the series, but sometimes he reviews whatever is popular at the moment. Walker has stated that the Nostalgia Critic character is primarily inspired by Daffy Duck and the Queen of Hearts, as well as by comedians Lewis Black, Stephen Colbert, and Bill Murray. Main cast * Doug Walker: Nostalgia Critic, the aggressive, childish and hot-tempered film critic and a fictionalized version of Doug Walker himself. He is characterized by his angry rants and hatred of bad movies. All of the reviews star him as the main character, and feature him providing commentary and criticism while talking directly to the audience. * Rob Walker: Rob is Doug's real-life older brother who appears in most of the Critic's videos as \\"The Other Guy\\" as well as different minor and major characters, notably Santa Christ. * Malcolm Ray: Malcolm is one of the Critic's friends who appears on the show and works with him on his videos. Malcolm often plays many secondary characters, most notably as the Devil in some of the sketches. * Rachel Tietz: She is a friend of the Critic's who worked with him and Malcolm on the show. She played multiple characters, including Evilina (the daughter of the Devil and Kim Kardashian) and Rita Repulsa (though her voice was dubbed by Doug Walker in that role). She later left the show after season six to pursue her career in Los Angeles but has made some cameos in later episodes, most recently in the review of Con Air. * Tamara Chambers: After Rachel left the show to pursue a career in Los Angeles, Tamara stepped in to take her place. She has her own short series called Tamara's Never Seen, where she opens talking about an iconic movie that she is about to watch for the first time, followed by her immediate impressions. She also plays a recurring character called Hyper Fangirl. She also has a second short series called Tamara Just Saw, where she opens talking about a brand new movie that she has just seen. * Jim Jarosz: Jim is a friend of the Critic's who often works with Tamara and Malcolm, though he is not present in every episode as Tamara and Malcolm are. He is mainly responsible for most of the props and set pieces in the show, most notably for the review of Mad Max: Fury Road. (Note: All of the cast members often play fictionalized versions of their real counterparts.) (Note 2: The series has also featured guest stars Mara Wilson, James Rolfe, Tom Ruegger, Sherri Stoner, Greg Sestero, JonTron, Dante Basco, Rob Paulsen, Maurice LaMarche, Cree Summer, Kyle Hebert, Corey Taylor, Michael Salvatori, and Don Bluth as themselves; co- reviewing, acting in sketch segments, or making a cameo appearance) Reception Nostalgia Critic initially received a positive response with many praising the humor, characters, and Doug Walker's performance. Greg Weisman, producer of Gargoyles, stated that he enjoyed the Critic's review of the show. Roger Ebert called the episode \\"A Tribute to Siskel and Ebert\\" \\"the best, funniest video about Siskel & Ebert I've ever seen\\". Walker later stated in his editorial titled \\"Farewell to Roger Ebert\\" that he has since had the quote framed and hung up on his wall, and in \\"The Making of a Nostalgia Critic Episode\\", it can be seen on his desk. Animation writer Paul Dini also thanked the Critic for his episode \\"The Top 11 Batman: The Animated Series Episodes\\". Seth Kearsley, director of Eight Crazy Nights, praised the Critic's review of the movie on his Twitter account. In 2014, Walker and Dante Basco collaborated in a countdown of the top eleven best episodes of the television series Avatar: The Last Airbender, on which Basco had played the character Zuko. Both Bill Farmer, the voice of Goofy, and Jason Marsden, the voice of Max, praised Channel Awesome after watching the Critic's editorial, Is Goofy Secretly Badass? On August 27, 2017, the Critic did a crossover with fellow Channel Awesome critic, Nash Bozard. For Here There Be Dragons, Bozard's review series about fantasy films and adaptations, the Nostalgia Critic and Nash reviewed the short-lived Syfy series The Dresden Files. The series is unofficially translated into many languages. On YouTube, one can find versions with Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese and Polish subtitles, as well as a version with Russian dubbing. However, of all of them, only Poland, where Nostalgia Critic is a cult series, has its own unofficial website devoted to Channel Awesome's reviewers and its YouTube channel. Doug Walker has also participated in many panel discussions at con-events, such as the \\"Movies Everybody Disagrees with You On\\" panel at the 2015 Animecon event in Kuopio, Finland.Animecon 2015 - Movies Everybody Disagrees with You OnThe World's Best Photos of Animecon and Finland On September 18, 2019, Doug Walker uploaded a YouTube video titled Nostalgia Critic's The Wall, a parody review of the film Pink Floyd ‚Äì The Wall adapted from the eponymous album that consisted primarily of parodies of The Walls songs, with Walker himself providing the vocals, as well as recreations of the film's scenes featuring Corey Taylor, frontman of Slipknot. The video received roughly 1.16 million views and a negative reception, with only 20,000 likes and 68,000 dislikes as of July 24, 2020. Miniseries The Nostalgia Critic character has appeared in three online miniseries for Channel Awesome: Kickassia (2010), Suburban Knights (2011), and To Boldly Flee (2012). Each series was produced annually in commemoration for the website's anniversary. In Kickassia, Nostalgia Critic and several other Channel Awesome trying to claim ownership of the micronation of Molossia. In Suburban Knights, the Critic and the gang cosplay as fantasy characters while on a quest searching for a mystical, powerful gauntlet in the Chicago suburbs. In To Boldly Flee, the Critic continues to blame himself for Ma-Ti's death from the previous anniversary special. Meanwhile, a series of mysterious events begin to unfold, which could shake the very fabric of internet critics as we know it. The film was initially going to retire the Nostalgic Critic character, as the character sacrifices himself in the end.

He is best known as the original producer and director of Chespirito's various 1970s television series as well as for producing and directing the late 1980s-early 1990s variety series Anabel.http://www.tvnotas.com.mx/famosos/521-Enrique-Segoviano/ Biography Segoviano began his career on-camera, in the 1966 movie Primer dia de clases When Television Independiente de Mexico began in 1969, Segoviano was hired as a staff producer and director. There, he first met Roberto Gomez Bola√±os while working on the series Sabado de la fortuna. Then in 1970, Segoviano became producer and director of the first Chespirito television series. In 1973, TIM merged with Telesistema Mexicano to become Televisa; Segoviano then stayed with Televisa. His first two Televisa series were El Chavo and El Chapul√≠n Colorado, both starring Chespirito. As producer and director of both series, Segoviano became responsible for introducing special effects to Mexican television. Segoviano's partnership with Chespirito ended in 1978, but not before he directed the movie El Chanfle, released by Televicine (now Videocine) the next year. By then Chespirito had taken over directorial duties. Also in 1979, Segoviano produced his first post-Chespirito series, Odisea burbujas. This program, which ran until 1984, became a pioneer in its usage of on-screen electronic graphics in its second year on the air. Shortly afterward, other Televisa programs, starting with those produced at Televisa San Angel, where Odisea burbujas and most of Segoviano's other programs were taped, followed suit. Nineteen eighty-four would be the first of two non-consecutive years in which Segoviano would produce and direct three different television series: Hola Mexico!, a precursor to Hoy notable for introducing actress Edith Gonz√°lez, and the telenovelas Te amo and Si, mi amor. His biggest success of the 1980s as well as the 1990s would be the variety series Anabel. The series made stars of several regulars, namely Anabel Ferreira and Maria Alicia Delgado, whose \\"Abuela\\" characterization was introduced on this series. A young Eugenio Derbez was a regular in the show's first few years. For several years during the show's run, he was nominated at the Premios TVyNovelas ceremonies against Ra√∫l Velasco (producer and host of Siempre en Domingo, which was annually preempted for the ceremonies) as producer of Mexico's \\"best variety series.\\" In 1995, Segoviano again found himself producing three series at the same time: Anabel, the comedy series Y sin embargo se mueve with Fernando Lujan, and the telenovela Pobre ni√±a rica. As of 2010 Segoviano remained a successful producer with Televisa. In 2001, he produced the game show 100 mexicanos dijeron, which was based on the American game show Family Feud. He most recently produced Todo el mundo cree que sabe.

History After its foundation as a private school in 1869, the school developed to grammar school under the school conductor Friedrich Koldewey. When this development was completed eleven years later, the responsibility for the school was transferred to the town of Bad Harzburg. The first school-leaving examination qualifying for university (Abitur) took place in 1918. After the World War II, lessons resumed on 13 December 1945.

Educational Work =Integration Class= With the enrollment of the 5th grade in the summer of 2006, the school concept was widened to include another point: that of an integration class. At the faculty meeting the request for inclusive education in a secondary school was adopted with a large majority. Since then, four mentally (one of them also physically) disabled children (Down syndrome) had successfully participated in the regular school life. Over the years, this integration received a wide range of national media attention. For its work in the field of integration, the Werner-von-Siemens-Gymnasium received the \\"School of the Year Award\\" in 2007, a prize by the magazine 'Unicum'. Scientific support for the integration class was provided by Prof. Dr. Jutta Schoeler. Besides the first successful integrated class with mentally disabled children at a Gymnasium, also other children with mental or physical disabilities have been attending the school. Some of these following their own curriculum, others with the same educational goals as their class mates. To ensure the best possible learning outcomes for all students in inclusive classes, some lessons are held separately, many together. During the joint lessons, both disabled and non-disabled students work on similar topics but with different learning objectives. During the school day, special needs children are assisted by additional teachers. =Foreign Languages= Teaching of foreign languages commences in grade 5 with English as a first foreign language. In grade 6, a second compulsory foreign language (either French or Latin) is taken up by students. In grade 10, there is the choice of another foreign language. This might also be taught at the \\"Nieders√§chsisches Internatsgymnasium\\" (NIG), a school that works in close cooperation with the Werner-von-Siemens-Gymnasium. In connection with exchange programs, students also receive Italian lessons. Additionally, some subjects teach selected units in English. =Cooperations= School partners include the 'Nieders√§chsisches Internatsgymnasium' (NIG) in Bad Harzburg and the 'Gymnasium Braunlage'. The cooperation includes joint courses especially in the upper years ('Gymnasiale Oberstufe') which are either taught at the NIG or at the Werner-von-Siemens- Gymnasium. In younger classes, students of all partner schools work on joint projects such as the 'Picus-Day' or a forest adventure. The cooperation also includes the personnel level, as regularly teachers from all schools are delegated to the other partner schools to ensure an adequate supply of lessons and to improve teaching quality. To improve the transition from primary school to high school, there is a regular exchange with the surrounding elementary schools. The cooperation includes regular meetings of teachers working with the 4th und 5th grades as well as visits to the respective schools. The 'M√∂nchehaus Museum f√ºr moderne Kunst' is a partner in the field of culture. In connection with this cooperation there are annual discussions with the current winners of the Goslar Kaiser Ring. In addition, the school cooperates with the Siemens company in Brunswick. This cooperation opens up, among others, opportunities for career guidance and internships. =Clubs= The Werner-von- Siemens-Gymnasium offers a range of activities for students to participate in outside of the classroom. In particular, the musical and artistic activities stand out with three choirs, an orchestra, a band and a drama club. The choirs perform several times a year, for example in the summer concert and the Christmas concert. In 2007 they also supported Achim Reichel and the NDR in reviving old German folk songs in a new rock version. =Student Exchanges= USA exchange As part of GAPP (German American Partnership Program), a bi-annual exchange between the Werner-von-Siemens Gymnasium Bad Harzburg and the Severna Park High School in Maryland was established in 1996. In 2011, the Upper Moreland High School became the new GAPP partner. Up to 20 students in grades 10 and 11 can take part. During the three-week stay in the United States which usually takes place in March or April, the program includes family life and school attendance. Other activities regularly include a three- day stay in New York City, a trip to Washington D.C. and a trip to Lancaster County (Pennsylvania). The return visit of the American students takes place before the summer holidays. The GAPP program also allows for students to stay for a full school year at their respective partner school. This offer has been taken up be several American students who attended the Werner-von-Siemens- Gymnasium. =Comenius project= As part of the Comenius programme, the school worked on a bilateral project together with the Liceo Linguistico Galileo Galilei (Civitavecchia, Italy) from 2011-2013. The project ‚Äì starting in 2011, 100 years after the first International Women's Day ‚Äì focused on the study, analysis and comparison of the actual situation of women in Germany and in Italy and how it has changed over the years. The fields of the role of women in the family and in employment will be the main focus in the project.http://www.100-years.eu/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=47&Itemid;=60‚ü®=en A second, multilateral programme takes place from 2013-2015. The other involved schools are form Saint-Agr√®ve, France, Mistretta, Sicily, Italy and Niksar, Turkey. The title of this project is \\"EU-Gusto\\".http://eu- gusto.eu/index.php/en/ England exchange From 1996 - 2009, an annual exchange took place with partner schools in Hitchin (England). Students in their 9th year visited with a host family in England and participated in their daily lives for ten days. In return, they also hosted their exchange partners for ten days. Activities included outings such as hikes to the Brocken. Poland exchange The Werner-von-Siemens-Gymnasium offered annually (since 1993) an exchange to Szklarska Porƒôba and (since 1998) to Bydgoszcz. Starting in 2014, the exchange takes students to Pozna≈Ñ. Unlike the other exchanges, the focus is not on language improvement, but on the understanding between Poles and Germans. Since most of the German exchange students have no knowledge of Polish, the language barriers are initially large, but are quickly overcome because of activities. Public Relations =Parents' Association= The Association of Parents and Friends of the Werner-von- Siemens-Gymnasium Bad Harzburg maintains the contact between parents, former students, friends of the school and the school management as well as the teaching staff. It supports activities at the school not only financially but also through public relations, such as through presentation and discussion sessions at the school with the Minister of Education Renate J√ºrgens-Pieper (2000), the Minister of Education Bernd Busemann (2006), the Minister of Education Elisabeth Heister-Neumann in 2008 and the Minister of Education Bernd Althusmann (2010). =Student newspaper= In 1964 the school newspaper \\"Profil\\", the oldest continually published and still existing school newspaper of Lower Saxony, was founded. It is published four times a year just before the holidays and is produced by one of the school clubs. A former staff member was Michael Sauga, now Berlin correspondent of the news magazine Der Spiegel.

Born in Rockford, Illinois, Ange Armato was the seventh girl out of eight children from a large Italian family. In high school, her teacher encouraged her to go to college to come a physical education teacher, but her career dream was to be an artist, so her parents sent her to art school. During that period of time, Armato went to her first baseball game and she was hooked. She then practiced with the Rockford Peaches for three years and went to school in Chicago. In the process, Armato was signed a contract and joined the Peaches in 1949, but due to an injury, she was unable to complete the season. In 1953 Armato returned to the league and was assigned to the Kalamazoo Lassies. She only had two hits in 26 at-bats for a .077 average, but was a sure-handed fielder at second base. Kalamazoo ended the season in third place with a 56-50 record and defeated the Fort Wayne Daisies in the first round, two to one games, but lost to the Grand Rapids Chicks in the final series in just two games.1953 Kalamazoo Lassies.

Armato did not play for the league's final season and returned home, where she worked for Barber Colman Company and became a pioneer for women draftsmen and later a technical illustrator.

She ended her career as advertising manager for Rockford Advertising Agency.

Released in September 1977, it is regarded by critics as a prototypic example of British punk, though it was not a chart hit.  Background  A version taped on 2 April 1977 at one of the band's earliest public performances had already been issued on a live compilation album, The Roxy London WC2, in June.Heylin (2007), p. 202; Tyler (2005), n.p. [3]. Tyler claims it was their second-ever live gig; Heylin identifies it as their second Roxy show, following a \\"couple of pub-rock venue runthroughs\\". The song attracted wide notice and led directly to the band's first record deal‚Äîa pact with the Virgin label for one single.Tyler (2005), n.p. [3]. Poly Styrene, X-Ray Spex's songwriter as well as lead vocalist, had been motivated to join the punk scene like many others as a result of attending a Sex Pistols concert‚Äîher first encounter with the band, when she still went by Marianne Elliot-Said, was in Hastings in early July 1976. Concerned with issues of consumerism and disposability, reflected in the name she soon adopted, she wrote \\"Oh Bondage Up Yours!\\" shortly after seeing the Pistols for a second time the following month.Heylin (2007), p. 201. The lyrics combine a depiction of contemporary capitalist materialism as a brand of servitudeTyler (2005), n.p. [2‚Äì3]. with a \\"feminist [...] rallying cry\\".Dougan (2002), p. 1250. Styrene later described it as \\"a call for liberation. It was saying: 'Bondage‚Äîforget it! I'm not going to be bound by the laws of consumerism or bound by my own senses.' It has that line in it: 'Chain smoke, chain gang, I consume you all': you are tied to these activities for someone else's profit.\\"Quoted in Savage (1992), p. 327. X-Ray Spex' instrumental lineup featured a saxophonist, unusual for a punk band.Raha (2005), p. 89. What made the woodwind player particularly stand out was that she was a girl, Susan Whitby, just 16 years old as of mid-1977. Band manager Falcon Stuart had helped convince Styrene that the presence of a second woman in the band would be a boon to their marketing.Heylin (2007), p. 201‚Äì2.  Content  Whitby's \\"freeform\\" style on her horn, writes Maria Raha, often yielded \\"staccato wails that faded quickly, like those of a sax player whizzing by in a car\\". Redubbed Lora Logic, her signature \\"rough rasp\\" would feature prominently in \\"Oh Bondage Up Yours!\\"Heylin (2007), p. 269. Richie Unterberger describes the single version's brief setup and raucous payoff: > \\"Some people say little girls should be seen and not heard,\\" Poly Styrene > solemnly intones. ... \\"But I think\\"‚Äîand then the voice suddenly rises to a > scream‚Äî\\"OH BONDAGE UP YOURS! 1-2-3-4!\\" Then the band kicks in with all the > immediacy of a custard pie in the face. Fuzzy power chords and careening > saxophone bleats fight it out with Styrene's half-chanted, half-sung vocals, > a mixture of glee and rage that periodically trails off into caterwauling > shrieks.Unterberger (1998), p. 280. Steve Huey describes it as \\"one of the most visceral moments in all of British punk\\",Huey (2002), p. 1250. though Al Spicer considers the studio single recording a \\"fairly lacklustre\\" version.Spicer (2003), p. 1194. In Gillian G. Gaar's analysis, the song \\"eagerly steamrolled over the idea of objectifying women by confronting the notion head on\\".Gaar (2002), p. 200. Raha writes, \\"Styrene and Logic were joyfully angry, liberated by the freedom punk afforded them.\\" In Lauraine Leblanc's view, Styrene's compositions, and \\"Oh Bondage Up Yours!\\" in particular, exemplify the emphasis female punk artists placed on parody and paradox. As she describes, the first verse goes > \\"Bind me, tie me, chain me to the wall / I wanna be a slave to you all!\\" > Paradoxically, the chorus [runs]: \\"Oh bondage! Up yours! / Oh bondage! Come > on!\\" As Styrene continue[s] on to the second verse, she reveal[s] that the > song is not about sex, but about consumerism: \\"Chain store, chain smoke, I > consume you all / Chain gang, chain mail, I don't think at all!\\" In this one > utterance, Styrene transformed a seemingly masochistic plea into an > indictment of consumer culture, denouncing the blind impulses of the > mainstream shopper. In depicting herself as both an agent of and resister to > her submission, she created a parody of both positions, juxtaposing them > powerfully against each other.Leblanc (1999), pp. 45‚Äì46. Logic later gave her view of the band leader's vision: \\"I think Marianne felt that everyone was in a type of bondage‚Äîrestricted, crushed, and alienated by modern materialistic society. The goal of our society is sense gratification‚Äîthat is the only prize on offer. But one can never satisfy the senses; it is an impossible goal.\\"Quoted in Raha (2005), p. 89.  Release and reception  Banned by the BBC, the single was very well received by critics, and though it failed to register on the charts,Heylin (2007), p. 268. it made the band a subject of extensive media interest. According to Gaar, among punk aficionados the single \\"quickly became an essential item that found its way into every self-respecting\\" collection. Retrospectively, John Dougan identifies it, alongside the early recordings of the Sex Pistols and The Clash, as \\"one of punk rock's defining moments\\". Jon Savage similarly calls it a \\"deserved press sensation\\" and a \\"definitive punk snapshot\\".Savage (1992), pp. 495, 570. Within a few weeks of its release, Logic departed the band, apparently sacked because Styrene wanted to be the exclusive focus of attention.Raha (2005), p. 90. The band, now with a male saxophonist, signed with EMI for its debut album, Germfree Adolescents, on which \\"Oh Bondage Up Yours!\\" did not appear.Heylin (2007), pp. 268‚Äì69.

O-glycosylation is a post-translational modification that occurs after the protein has been synthesised. In eukaryotes, it occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus and occasionally in the cytoplasm; in prokaryotes, it occurs in the cytoplasm. Several different sugars can be added to the serine or threonine, and they affect the protein in different ways by changing protein stability and regulating protein activity. O-glycans, which are the sugars added to the serine or threonine, have numerous functions throughout the body, including trafficking of cells in the immune system, allowing recognition of foreign material, controlling cell metabolism and providing cartilage and tendon flexibility. Because of the many functions they have, changes in O-glycosylation are important in many diseases including cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer's. O-glycosylation occurs in all domains of life, including eukaryotes, archaea and a number of pathogenic bacteria including Burkholderia cenocepacia, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Acinetobacter baumannii. Common types of O-glycosylation =O-N-acetylgalactosamine (O-GalNAc)= Common O-GalNAc core structures; Core 1, Core 2 and poly-N-acetyllactosamine structures. Addition of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to a serine or threonine occurs in the Golgi apparatus, after the protein has been folded. The process is performed by enzymes known as GalNAc transferases (GALNTs), of which there are 20 different types. The initial O-GalNAc structure can be modified by the addition of other sugars, or other compounds such as methyl and acetyl groups. These modifications produce 8 core structures known to date. Different cells have different enzymes that can add further sugars, known as glycosyltransferases, and structures therefore change from cell to cell. Common sugars added include galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, fucose and sialic acid. These sugars can also be modified by the addition of sulfates or acetyl groups. N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) can be added to the H-antigen to form the A-antigen. Galactose (Gal) can be added to form the B-antigen. Biosynthesis GalNAc is added onto a serine or threonine residue from a precursor molecule, through the activity of a GalNAc transferase enzyme. This precursor is necessary so that the sugar can be transported to where it will be added to the protein. The specific residue onto which GalNAc will be attached is not defined, because there are numerous enzymes that can add the sugar and each one will favour different residues. However, there are often proline (Pro) residues near the threonine or serine. Once this initial sugar has been added, other glycosyltransferases can catalyse the addition of additional sugars. Two of the most common structures formed are Core 1 and Core 2. Core 1 is formed by the addition of a galactose sugar onto the initial GalNAc. Core 2 consists of a Core 1 structure with an additional N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) sugar. A poly-N-acetyllactosamine structure can be formed by the alternating addition of GlcNAc and galactose sugars onto the GalNAc sugar. Terminal sugars on O-glycans are important in recognition by lectins and play a key role in the immune system. Addition of fucose sugars by fucosyltransferases forms Lewis epitopes and the scaffold for blood group determinants. Addition of a fucose alone creates the H-antigen, present in people with blood type O. By adding a galactose onto this structure, the B-antigen of blood group B is created. Alternatively, adding a GalNAc sugar will create the A-antigen for blood group A. PSGL-1 has several O-glycans to extend the ligand away from the cell surface. An sLex epitope allows interactions with the receptor for leukocyte localisation. Functions O-GalNAc sugars are important in a variety of processes, including leukocyte circulation during an immune response, fertilisation, and protection against invading microbes. O-GalNAc sugars are common on membrane glycoproteins, where they help increase rigidity of the region close to the membrane so that the protein extends away from the surface. For example, the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL) is projected from the cell surface by a region rigidified by O-glycans. In order for leukocytes of the immune system to move into infected cells, they have to interact with these cells through receptors. Leukocytes express ligands on their cell surface to allow this interaction to occur. P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) is such a ligand, and contains a lot of O-glycans that are necessary for its function. O-glycans near the membrane maintain the elongated structure and a terminal sLex epitope is necessary for interactions with the receptor. Mucins are a group of heavily O-glycosylated proteins that line the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts to protect these regions from infection. Mucins are negatively charged, which allows them to interact with water and prevent it from evaporating. This is important in their protective function as it lubricates the tracts so bacteria cannot bind and infect the body. Changes in mucins are important in numerous diseases, including cancer and inflammatory bowel disease. Absence of O-glycans on mucin proteins changes their 3D shape dramatically and often prevents correct function. =O-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc)= Addition of N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) to serine and threonine residues usually occurs on cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins that remain in the cell, while O-GalNAc modifications usually occur on proteins that will be secreted. The modification was only recently discovered, but the number of proteins with it is increasing rapidly. It is the first example of glycosylation that does not occur on secretory proteins. O-GlcNAc is added to the protein by O-GlcNAc transferase and is removed by O-GlcNAcase in a continuous cycle. O-GlcNAcylation differs from other O-glycosylation processes because there are usually no sugars added onto the core structure and because the sugar can be attached or removed from a protein several times. This addition and removal occurs in cycles and is performed by two very specific enzymes. O-GlcNAc is added by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and removed by O-GlcNAcase (OGA). Because there are only two enzymes that affect this specific modification, they are very tightly regulated and depend on a lot of other factors. Because O-GlcNAc can be added and removed, it is known as a dynamic modification and has a lot of similarities to phosphorylation. O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation can occur on the same threonine and serine residues, suggesting a complex relationship between these modifications that can affect many functions of the cell. The modification affects processes like the cells response to cellular stress, the cell cycle, protein stability and protein turnover. It may be implicated in neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson‚Äôs and late-onset Alzheimer‚Äôs and has been found to play a role in diabetes. Additionally, O-GlcNAcylation can enhance the Warburg Effect, which is defined as the change that occurs in the metabolism of cancer cells to favour their growth. Because both O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation can affect specific residues and therefore both have important functions in regulating signalling pathways, both of these processes provide interesting targets for cancer research. =O-Mannose (O-Man)= O-Mannose sugars attached to serine and threonine residues on Œ±-dystroglycan separate the two domains of the protein. Addition of Ribitol-P, xylose and glucuronic acid forms a long sugar that can stabilise the interaction with the basement membrane. O-mannosylation involves the transfer of a mannose from a dolichol-P-mannose donor molecule onto the serine or threonine residue of a protein. Most other O-glycosylation processes use a sugar nucleotide as a donor molecule. A further difference from other O-glycosylations is that the process is initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum of the cell, rather than the Golgi apparatus. However, further addition of sugars occurs in the Golgi. Until recently, it was believed that the process is restricted to fungi, however it occurs in all domains of life; eukaryotes, (eu)bacteria and archae(bacteri)a. The best characterised O-mannosylated human protein is Œ±-dystroglycan. O-Man sugars separate two domains of the protein, required to connect the extracellular and intracellular regions to anchor the cell in position. Ribitol, xylose and glucuronic acid can be added to this structure in a complex modification that forms a long sugar chain. This is required to stabilise the interaction between Œ±-dystroglycan and the extracellular basement membrane. Without these modifications, the glycoprotein cannot anchor the cell which leads to congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD), characterised by severe brain malformations. =O-Galactose (O-Gal)= O-galactose is commonly found on lysine residues in collagen, which often have a hydroxyl group added to form hydroxylysine. Because of this addition of an oxygen, hydroxylysine can then be modified by O-glycosylation. Addition of a galactose to the hydroxyl group is initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum, but occurs predominantly in the Golgi apparatus and only on hydroxylysine residues in a specific sequence. While this O-galactosylation is necessary for correct function in all collagens, it is especially common in collagen types IV and V. In some cases, a glucose sugar can be added to the core galactose. =O-Fucose (O-Fuc)= Addition of fucose sugars to serine and threonine residues is an unusual form of O-glycosylation that occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and is catalysed by two fucosyltransferases. These were discovered in Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii. Several different enzymes catalyse the elongation of the core fucose, meaning that different sugars can be added to the initial fucose on the protein. Along with O-glucosylation, O-fucosylation is mainly found on epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains found in proteins. O-fucosylation on EGF domains occurs between the second and third conserved cysteine residues in the protein sequence. Once the core O-fucose has been added, it is often elongated by addition of GlcNAc, galactose and sialic acid. Notch is an important protein in development, with several EGF domains that are O-fucosylated. Changes in the elaboration of the core fucose determine what interactions the protein can form, and therefore which genes will be transcribed during development. O-fucosylation might also play a role in protein breakdown in the liver. =O-Glucose (O-Glc)= Similarly to O-fucosylation, O-glucosylation is an unusual O-linked modification as it occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum, catalysed by O-glucosyltransferases, and also requires a defined sequence in order to be added to the protein. O-glucose is often attached to serine residues between the first and second conserved cysteine residues of EGF domains, for example in clotting factors VII and IX. O-glucosylation also appears to be necessary for the proper folding of EGF domains in the Notch protein. Proteoglycans Structures of heparan sulphate and keratan sulphate, formed by the addition of xylose or GalNAc sugars, respectively, onto serine and threonine residues of proteins. Proteoglycans consist of a protein with one or more sugar side chains, known as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), attached to the oxygen of serine and threonine residues. GAGs consist of long chains of repeating sugar units. Proteoglycans are usually found on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix (ECM), and are important for the strength and flexibility of cartilage and tendons. Absence of proteoglycans is associated with heart and respiratory failure, defects in skeletal development and increased tumor metastasis. Different types of proteoglycans exist, depending on the sugar that is linked to the oxygen atom of the residue in the protein. For example, the GAG heparan sulphate is attached to a protein serine residue through a xylose sugar. The structure is extended with several N-acetyllactosamine repeating sugar units added onto the xylose. This process is unusual and requires specific xylosyltransferases. Keratan sulphate attaches to a serine or threonine residue through GalNAc, and is extended with two galactose sugars, followed by repeating units of glucuronic acid (GlcA) and GlcNAc. Type II keratan sulphate is especially common in cartilage. Lipids Structure of ceramide, galactosylceramide and glucosylceramide. Galactose or glucose sugars can be attached to a hydroxyl group of ceramide lipids in a different form of O-glycosylation, as it does not occur on proteins. This forms glycosphingolipids, which are important for the localisation of receptors in membranes. Incorrect breakdown of these lipids leads to a group of diseases known as sphingolipidoses, which are often characterised by neurodegeneration and developmental disabilities. Because both galactose and glucose sugars can be added to the ceramide lipid, we have two groups of glycosphingolipids. Galactosphingolipids are generally very simple in structure and the core galactose is not usually modified. Glucosphingolipids, however, are often modified and can become a lot more complex. Biosynthesis of galacto- and glucosphingolipids occurs differently. Glucose is added onto ceramide from its precursor in the endoplasmic reticulum, before further modifications occur in the Golgi apparatus. Galactose, on the other hand, is added to ceramide already in the Golgi apparatus, where the galactosphingolipid formed is often sulfated by addition of sulfate groups. Glycogenin One of the first and only examples of O-glycosylation on tyrosine, rather than on serine or threonine residues, is the addition of glucose to a tyrosine residue in glycogenin. Glycogenin is a glycosyltransferase that initiates the conversion of glucose to glycogen, present in muscle and liver cells. Clinical significance All forms of O-glycosylation are abundant throughout the body and play important roles in many cellular functions. Lewis epitopes are important in determining blood groups, and allow the generation of an immune response if we detect foreign organs. Understanding them is important in organ transplants. Hinge regions of immunoglobulins contain highly O-glycosylated regions between individual domains to maintain their structure, allow interactions with foreign antigens and protect the region from proteolytic cleavage. Alzheimer‚Äôs may be affected by O-glycosylation. Tau, the protein that accumulates to cause neurodegeneration in Alzheimer‚Äôs, contains O-GlcNAc modifications which may be implicated in disease progression. Changes in O-glycosylation are extremely common in cancer. O-glycan structures, and especially the terminal Lewis epitopes, are important in allowing tumor cells to invade new tissues during metastasis. Understanding these changes in O-glycosylation of cancer cells can lead to new diagnostic approaches and therapeutic opportunities.

After graduating from the University of Glasgow, he was the first pathologist and Assistant Director of Research at the Beatson Institute for Cancer Research in Glasgow. Much of his work concerned, pathology, disease, aerospace medicine, medical records, medical education, first aid, malaria, tropical medicine, physiology and occupational health. Early life Whittingham was the second son of Engineer-Rear Admiral William Whittingham CB and Elizabeth Annie, and like his siblings he chose to study medicine. He was educated at Christ's Hospital, the Greenock Academy and the University of Glasgow. As an undergraduate he excelled at winning medals of distinction in Zoology, Surgery, Pathology and the Gairdner medal in the practice of medicine. His first post in 1910 was as pathologist and assistant director of research at the Royal Cancer Hospital, Glasgow, (later renamed to the Beaston Institute) which had a dedicated area for the pathological study of cancer. In 1915 he was a volunteer in the first world war serving in the Royal Army Medical Corps and subsequently the Royal Flying Corps in India and Mesopotamia where he pursued his studies in tropical medicine. In 1917 his younger brother Clive, who was also a physician, was killed in action followed by his elder brother William, who was killed in action in 1918. RAF =Tropical medicine= Whittingham had a long career in the RAF beginning in 1918 when he was transferred to the Royal Air Force as a pathologist. Promotion followed and by 1923, he was Wing commander and head of the Sandfly fever commission, stationed at Kalafrana, Malta. He was the first to study and breed sandfly in captivity; his recommendations resulted in reduced incidence of sandfly fever within the RAF. For his sandfly research paper he was awarded the North Persian Medal in 1923 which was awarded annually for the best tropical research paper. His highly detailed sandfly drawings were displayed at the British Empire Exhibition of 1924 and are now in the Wellcome Library in London. As well as serving as director of pathology and tropical medicines for the RAF, he gave biochemistry lectures at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine during the inter-war years. =Aviation medicine= From 1927 to 1939 he was a pathologist at the Royal Buckinghamshire Hospital and in 1930 he was awarded the CBE. In 1932 he became Group captain and from 1934 until 1939 was the commanding officer of the RAF Central Medical Establishment, promoted to Air commodore in 1936. He took the Membership of the Royal College of Physicians in 1936 and was elected FRCP in 1940. From 1938 until 1946 he held the appointment of honorary physician to the king. He was given a knighthood at the beginning of World War II. Many of his lecture notes, drawings and cartoons were implemented into Air Ministry booklets such as Health Hints for Warm Climates and distributed for the well- being of British servicemen. Lessons learnt from the second world war indicated that there was a requirement for studying the effects of aviation on aircrew and in 1943 he proposed the establishment of the RAF Institute of Aviation Medicine (IAM). He was successful and it was eventually built on a corner of Farnborough airfield and officially opened by the Princess Royal in 1945. Problems with exposure to altitude in flying such as hypoxia had already been recognised and with future high altitude aircraft such as English Electric Canberra being envisaged, the IAM played an important role in altitude protection. They covered both military and commercial issues such as determining the safe maximum cabin altitude for commercial passenger aircraft. Post World War II He was made Legion of Merit commander USA and Order of Polonia Restitutain 1945 retiring from the RAF in 1946 to become medical adviser to the British Red Cross Society where his expertise was used for military and civilian first aid manuals. In 1948 he joined BOAC as director of medical services where he worked for the next decade. In 1949 he was appointed chairman of the Air Ministry Flying Personnel Research Committee, whose brief was to advise the Secretary of State for Air on all aspects of research concerning flight safety. Whittingham and his colleagues travelled the world examining medical facilities, sanitation and food supplies in BOAC stations and made reports and recommendations for improvement. During his career he made significant contributions toward investigating medical evidence from aircraft crashes; most significantly, the Comet disasters. The findings of the Comet team led by Group Captain Bill Stewart demonstrated the need for research trained, medical specialists and this led to the formation of the RAF Department of Aviation Pathology. In 1955, a conference was held from which the Joint Committee on Aviation Pathology was formed consisting of members from the flying services of the USA, Canada and Britain. Whittingham, a BMA member, was held in high esteem by his peers and in 1973, the RCP professorship of aviation medicine was renamed the Whittingham professorship \\"in honour of his outstanding leadership in this field\\".

Activities  The ASL was established in Jan 1907 to assist with the preparations for the Mud March organised by the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies in February 1907. Mary Lowndes was a founder member in 1907 and its chairman in 1913. Other than the central committee of chair, vice-chair and treasurer, the organisation had no traditional formal structure or statement of aims. Lowndes' home, the Brittany Studios at 259 King's Road in Chelsea was used as the studio for the group of professional women artists who formed the ASL. The ASL produced posters and postcards and designed and produced around 80 embroidered banners for the Mud March in 1908. In 1913 the ASL was supplying posters to women's suffrage groups in America. Lowndes and the league moved to 27 Trafalgar Square in Chelsea in 1917. The body was responsible for the creation of a large number of posters, Christmas cards, postcards and banners designed by artists who included the chair Mary Lowndes, Emily Ford, Barbara Forbes, May H Barker, Clara Billing, Dora Meeson Coates, Violet Garrard, Bertha Newcombe, C Hedley Charlton and Emily J.

ASL member Barbara Forbes suggested \\"a man in a sailing boat (the sail represents the Vote). A woman with only oars - out in the sea of Labour\\". Grant was awarded the first prize, four pounds, for a poster depicting a woman heading towards the Parliament of the United Kingdom rowing a boat in heavy seas, while a man in a sailing boat effortlessly passes her on a high wave. Grant added the caption \\"Britons, why handicap the weaker vessel?\\", which was shortened to \\"Handicapped!\\" in the poster published by the ASL. It became one of the ASL's most striking posters.

It recruited on the Isle of Man and was attached to 53rd Light Anti-Aircraft Brigade in Anti-Aircraft Command at the outbreak of World War II. The regiment was posted to the Middle East in November 1940 where it served with various formations before joining the 7th Armoured Division in August 1942. It served with the division through the North African, Italian and North West European campaigns. Post-war, it was reformed as the 515th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment before being reduced to a staff troop in 42nd (East Lancashire) Infantry Division in 1955. History =Formation= The 15th (Isle of Man) Light Anti-Aircraft Brigade, RA (TA) was formed with two batteries on 1 July 1938 at Douglas, Isle of Man. In December 1938 the batteries were numbered as 41st and 42nd and on 1 January 1939 the brigade was redesignated as a regiment. On 26 August 1939 a third battery - 129th - was regimented to bring the unit up to full strength. =World War II= At the outbreak of World War II, the regiment was assigned to 53rd Light Anti-Aircraft Brigade, 4th Anti-Aircraft Division in Anti-Aircraft Command. The regiment was mobilised shortly before the outbreak of the war and sailed from the Isle of Man to Liverpool to take up air defence of the River Mersey during the Liverpool Blitz. In November 1940 the Regiment was sent to Egypt, with 41st Battery being deployed to the Sudan, 129th Battery with 11 Bofors guns to Crete (where it was to be overrun by German forces in 1941) and 42nd Battery remaining in Egypt. In August 1942 the regiment joined the 7th Armoured Division (the Desert Rats), and fought with it at the Battle of El Alamein.

Anyone who, for compensation, prepares all or substantially all of any federal tax return or claim for refund must obtain a PTIN issued by the IRS.  PTIN history  The Preparer Tax Identification Number was created in 1999 to protect the privacy of tax return preparers. Preparers were required to sign the tax forms they prepared and provide their Social Security Numbers. Starting with the 2000 tax season, the IRS gave preparers the option of using either their SSNs or PTINs.IRS News Release, IR-1999-72, Aug. 24, 1999, IRS TO ISSUE ALTERNATIVE IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS FOR TAX PREPARERS Between August 1999 and August 2010, the IRS issued more than 1 million PTINs.  PTIN registration  The IRS on September 28, 2010 launched a new, electronic PTIN sign-up system accessible through its website at www.irs.gov/taxpros. The new sign-up system requires return preparers to create an account, complete the PTIN application, pay a $64.25 fee and obtain a PTIN,IRS.gov www.irs.gov/ptin however, this fee is no longer valid and there is no fee to obtain a PTIN today. By creating an account, preparers create a central location where they can receive IRS information.IRS News Release, IR-2010-91, Aug. 19, 2010, IRS Announces New Return Preparer Application System and User Fee Preparers should receive their PTINs immediately. Even preparers who already have PTINs must renew their numbers if they received them prior to September 28, 2010. If all information matches, preparers may receive the same number. The PTIN must be renewed annually. Each preparer must have his or her personal PTIN. Sharing a PTIN within an office or firm is not allowed. Preparers can submit a paper application, the Form W-12, but it will take four to six weeks to process. The electronic PTIN sign-up system takes 15 minutes to complete and process. Preparers can view an IRS YouTube video that explains the PTIN sign-up system. Preparers who do not have social security numbers because of religious objections can complete the PTIN application and submit paper Form 8945, PTIN Supplemental Application For U.S. Citizens Without a Social Security Number Due To Conscientious Religious Objection. They must also include documentation on identity, U.S. citizenship and status in a recognized religious group.IRS.gov New Requirements for Tax Return Preparers: Frequently Asked Questions  Foreign tax return preparers  Foreign tax return preparers who prepare U.S. tax returns must also obtain and use a PTIN. Foreign preparers who do not have or who are not eligible for social security numbers must complete the PTIN application and submit paper Form 8946, PTIN Supplemental Application For Foreign Persons Without a Social Security Number. Only preparers who have a foreign (non-U.S.) address may file this form.  Outreach to tax return preparers  In October 2010, the IRS began sending notices to the 1 million PTIN holders it had on record, informing them of the rule changes and urging them to obtain a new or renewed PTIN before preparing tax returns in 2011.IRS News Release, IR-2010-106, Oct. 25, 2010, IRS Begins Notifying Tax Return Preparers on PTIN Renewals However, the agency does not know how many of those 1 million PTIN holders are still active tax return preparers. Nor, does the agency know how many total tax return preparers there are in the United States. It estimates the number at 900,000 to 1.2 million.  Penalties  Return preparers who fail to obtain and use PTINs could face penalties. The IRS announced in November 2010 that it would not put the onus of compliance on individual taxpayers by rejecting tax returns without valid PTINs. However, the agency said it would contact those tax return preparers and urge them to comply with the PTIN mandate.Russell, Roger, \\"Getting a PTIN is Painless,\\" WEBCPA (Accounting Today), retrieved Nov. 11, 2010  RTRP program  The use of the PTIN predated by many years the launching of the IRS Registered Tax Return Preparer Program in 2010. Thus, the requirement that a tax return preparer use either a social security number or a PTIN when engaged in the business of preparing federal tax returns pre-dated the requirements that had been imposed by the Internal Revenue Service in its Registered Tax Return Preparer program. =Loving v. Internal Revenue Service= On January 18, 2013, in a decision in Loving v. Internal Revenue Service, Judge James E. Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that the Internal Revenue Service lacked the statutory authority to regulate tax return preparers.Flatch, Robert, \\"Court Shuts Down IRS Regulation of Tax Preparers,\\" Main Street, retrieved Jan. 31, 2013 On February 1, 2013, the Court issued an additional order clarifying that the IRS is \\"not required to suspend its PTIN program,\\" but that \\"no tax-return preparer may be required to pay testing or continuing-education fees or to complete any testing or continuing education.\\"Memorandum Opinion and Order, Feb. 1, 2013, docket entry 28, Loving v.

It's great to be playing a good guy for once as I‚Äôve played a lot of baddies in my time. Michael is a real family guy and it'll be interesting to see how his character develops.\\" Michael arrives in Shieldinch and inspects 11 Montego Street, which he has bought. He opens the fridge to store a bottle of champagne and finds a post-it note with \\"found you\\" on it, which Gabriel has put there. When leaving the house, he asks Stella Walker (Keira Lucchesi) where Gabriel is and walks away. He tells Gabriel that he does not want any trouble as the family is making a fresh start. Michael then returns home to pack up the rest of the family's belongings. Michael receives a phone call from his ex-wife Chloe and has to go to see her. She tells him that she is moving to Canada and that Conor and Nicole will have to stay with him. Later, Michael finds out that Nicole has been seeing Charlie Bowie (Ryan Smith) and he angrily confronts him, but Nicole admits that Charlie refused to see her after he discovered her age. He then apologizes to Charlie for his behaviour. Michael diagnoses Scarlett Mullen (Sally Howitt) with ovarian cancer. When Scarlett will not tell her family, Michael puts her medical records on the floor of the surgery and lies to Scarlett's mother and cleaner Molly O'Hara (Una McLean) asking her to clear a chemical spillage. Molly finds the medical records and reads them, discovering Scarlett has cancer. Later, Michael helps Scarlett when she becomes ill and goes to the hospital with her.  Leyla Brodie  Leyla Brodie, played by Maryam Hamidi, is the wife of Michael (Andy Clark) and mother of Adeeb Brodie (Taryam Boyd). She made her first on-screen appearance on 12 October 2010. ATV describes her as a \\"modern Muslim\\". She has also been described as \\"pushy\\". Speaking of her casting, Hamidi said, \\"Family set-ups are never that simple in our society and hopefully the journey our new family is going on will be one a lot of modern and multi-cultural families can relate to. I really enjoy the verve and spirit of River City, but hope the Brodies are going to offer Shieldinch a little class and sophistication.\\" Leyla arrives in Shieldinch with Michael and Adeeb. She tells Michael she is fine with leaving university to become his receptionist at The Health Centre. Later, Leyla clashes with Molly O'Hara (Una McLean) when she mistakes her for a doctor and explains she doesn't have a problem with her ethnic background. She is horrified to see Michael‚Äôs brother Gabriel (Garry Sweeney) and tells Michael that he is dependent on him. Leyla continues to struggle working at the surgery and drops a pile of patients' files on the floor. Whilst picking them up, she misses the note which nurse Ruth Carroll (Morag Calder) had placed on one of them for allergies relating to flu injections. When patient Mr Stewart (Jackie Farrell) falls ill from the injection, Ruth‚Äôs professionalism is questioned and she is sent home by Michael. Leyla then finds the note on the floor but hides it. When Ruth and Leyla help Grayson who has collapsed in the street, Ruth panics as she is trying to help him. She tells Leyla she is worried she will make another mistake, but Leyla tells her that Mr Stewart's collapsing was not her fault. Ruth asks Leyla why the incident was not her fault and Leyla admits that she found the note from the file, but did not tell Michael. Leyla also tells Michael that the incident was not Ruth's fault.  Adeeb Brodie  Adeeb Brodie, played by Taryam Boyd, is the son of Leyla Brodie (Maryam Hamidi). He made his first on-screen appearance on 12 October 2010. ATV describes him as an \\"intelligent kid\\" who takes his real dad‚Äôs Iraqi heritage very seriously. Adeeb arrives in Shieldinch with Leyla and stepfather Michael Brodie (Andy Clark) and moves into 11 Montego Street. When Adeeb begins to spend more time on his laptop, Leyla assumes that he is watching pornography. Adeeb explains to Michael that he wants to move to Iraq because he feels he does not belong in Scotland. Michael tells Leyla and she agrees to take Adeeb to Iraq for a holiday.  Nicole Brodie  Nicole Brodie, played by Holly Jack, is the daughter of Michael (Andy Clark) and the sister of Conor (Rian John Gordon). She made her first on-screen appearance on 12 October 2010. ATV describes her as \\"14 going on 40\\". Speaking of her casting, Jack said, \\"I think they [her parents] were happier than me when I got the part. My mum was screaming down the phone. I think she nearly had a heart attack.\\" Nicole is first seen shopping in Hola boutique where she meets Charlie Bowie (Ryan Smith), who thinks she is older than she really is. Nicole flirts with Charlie and gives him her phone number. She later truants from school and visits Charlie. Nicole later arranges a date with Charlie, telling Michael she feels too ill to go to school. When Nicole kisses Charlie, Annie Sobacz (Reanne Farley) stops her and tells Charlie that Nicole is a school girl. Nicole then turns up at Charlie‚Äôs flat and he tells her that he knows she is still at school. She tells Charlie that they can have a secret relationship and that age is not important. After Michael asks her if she is in a relationship with someone, Nicole tells him that she was seeing Charlie. Michael angrily confronts Charlie, thinking he is a pervert, but Charlie tells him he thought Nicole was a college student. When Michael asks for the truth, Nicole admits that Charlie refused to see her after he discovered her age. Nicole then fell for school mate Sean but her friend Carmen also liked him thus pitting each girl against the other. When Nicole embarrasses Carmen in front of Sean, Carmen begins a bullying campaign against her that outlasts Nicole's feelings for Sean. Vulnerable, frightened and lonely, Nicole turns to Councillor Nick Morrison for emotional support. Her affection for Nick begins to grow and turns to love after he saves her from a physical attack at the hands of the school bullies. Mistaking his gentle care for requited feelings of love, Nicole tries to kiss Nick and he pushes her away but there is no denying a connection between them. Eventually finding out about Nicole and Nick, Michael and Layla flips out which in turn pushes Nicole away even further from the family, annoyed that her father still treats her like a child and not approving of any boy she intends on seeing even Stevie who has a drug and alcohol problem. Eventually Nicole finds out about her stepmother's affair with her uncle Gabriel. This is the last straw for Nicole and she runs away from home. She falls into a bad crowd with a guy named Cammie who lures and grooms her to sell on to wealthy clients, while also finding the time to threaten and blackmail her teen pal, Christina. She is eventually helped out by one of Cammie's girls who advises her to get out even though she has no way of doing the same for herself. Nicole gets away and makes her way home after weeks of being gone, and a search by friends, family and police. She arrives home and tells the truth to her father of why she ran away, which prompts Michael to have a meltdown with Layla and disown his brother Gabriel. In 2013, Nicole gives birth to a daughter called Grace. She struggles to be a young single mum and considers putting her up for adoption when she gets a place in a college in Aberdeen and plans to leave Shieldinch but when Grace develops meningitis Nicole realizes that she could not lose her and decides she will take Grace with her, she left in the back of a black cab to the train station.  Conor Brodie  Conor Brodie, played by Rian Gordon, is the son of Michael (Andy Clark) and the brother of Nicole (Holly Jack). He made his first on-screen appearance on 12 October 2010. ATV describes him as a \\"typical teenage boy\\". Conor arrives in Shieldinch with Nicole. After Leo (Nick Rhys) asks Conor whether Leyla (Maryam Hamidi) had something to do with Michael quitting the army, he questions Michael asking he why he never talks about his former job. He then tells Michael that he and his friends are thinking about joining the army, but Michael disagrees. Conor shows Leo his cadet's uniform, but Michael sees and asks him if he had permission. Conor tells Michael that he forged his signature on the consent form. Michael disapproves telling Conor he is not joining cadets, but Leo says that he is proud of him.  Leo Brodie  Leo Brodie, played by Nick Rhys, is the younger brother of Michael (Andy Clark) and Gabriel (Garry Sweeney). He made his first on-screen appearance on 2 November 2010. ATV describes him as \\"young man about the town\\". Speaking of his casting, Rhys said, \\"Being a young man about the town, there will definitely be someone Leo takes a shine to, who that may be you will have to wait and see.\\" Rhys later commented that Leo was not a one- dimensional character, calling him 'complicated'. Leo arrives in Shieldinch and meets Hayley McCrone (Pamela Byrne) and overhears that she will not wear a Remembrance Day poppy because she does not want to put a hole in her cardigan. He asks her if it matters and she tells him that handing over her money is the main thing, before walking away. Leo then visits Michael and is passive with his wife Leyla (Maryam Hamidi). Leo later asks Conor (Rian John Gordon) if he thinks whether Leyla had something to do with Michael quitting the army. Before Leo returns to Afghanistan, Hayley kisses him but she pulls away admitting it was wrong. Michael receives a phone call from the army, who tell him that Leo has been injured. Later, Michael discovers that Leo will recover.  Reception  Andrea Mullaney of The Scotsman said that it was a \\"strange novelty\\" to see the Brodie family move into an empty house with their belongings, rather than taking on the previous inhabitants belongings. She commented: \\"So it was actually mildly refreshing to see the new family in River City walk around their new, empty house, pondering where to put their belongings when the removal van got there.\\"  References   External links  *River City characters ‚Äì Gabriel Brodie on the BBC website * River City characters ‚Äì Michael Brodie on the BBC website Category:Television characters introduced in 2010 Category:Soap opera families Category:River City ","title":"Brodie family"},{"id":"29588052","text":"USS Charles Mann (SP-522) in Boston Harbor, Boston, Massachusetts, sometime between 1917 and 1919.

One of the supporting facts presented is that, in the Supreme Court appeal of the original verdict implicating Kastner, all five Supreme Court Judges upheld Judge Halevi's initial verdict on the \\"criminal and perjurious way\\" in which Kastner after the war had testified on behalf of Nazi war criminal Kurt Becher.Hecht 1961, p. 247.

There are several versions of the game: * In one version, the first player tagged by It then becomes It, and another round of the game is played. The Chinese version refers to the tagged It as l√¨ng d√†i ‰ª§‰ª£, literally \\"to bid to take the place of\\". * In another version, whenever any player is tagged by It, that player is out of the game. The game proceeds until all players are out of the game, at which point another round of the game starts, with either the first player or the last player to be tagged becoming the next It player. * In yet another version, It feels the face of the person tagged and attempts to identify the person, and only if the person is correctly identified does the person become It. * In a unique Japanese version, young girls dress up in their kimonos and the blind-folded girl must catch or touch the other girls both while blindfolded and at the same time carrying a full cup of tea. This is portrayed in Shuntei Miyagawa's woodblock print Kodomo-no-Asobi (Children at Play), published in 1899 by Matsuki Heikichi of Tokyo. Petit Livre d'Amour, by Pierre Sala Partie de Collin- maillard avec des jeunes femmes History David Wilkie, Paul Jarrard & Sons, London, 1820s A version of the game was played in Ancient Greece where it was called \\"copper mosquito.\\"A Greek-English Lexicon.

The game is played by children in Bangladesh known as Kanamachi meaning blind fly. One individual is blind-folded in order to catch or touch one of the others who run around repeating, \\"The blind flies are hovering fast! Catch whichever you can!\\" The game has been known to be played since during the Tudor period, as there are references to its recreation by Henry VIII's courtiers. It was also a popular parlor game in the Victorian era.

( , ) is a 2011 Lebanese film directed by Nadine Labaki. The film premiered during the 2011 Cannes Film Festival as part of Un Certain Regard . The film was selected to represent Lebanon for the 84th Academy Awards, but it did not make the final shortlist. The film won the People's Choice Award at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival.\\"The people‚Äôs surprise at TIFF\\". Toronto Star, September 18, 2011. It was the highest- grossing Lebanese film, and the highest-grossing Arabic film, earning worldwide, up until it was surpassed by Labaki's later film Capernaum (2018). Plot Where Do We Go Now? tells the story of a remote, isolated unnamed Lebanese village inhabited by both Muslims and Christians. The village is surrounded by landmines and only accessible by a small bridge. As civil strife engulfs the country, the women in the village try, by various means and with varying success, to keep their men in the dark, sabotaging the village radio, then destroying the village TV. The story begins with a boy named Roukoz, whose job ‚Äì along with his cousin, Nassim ‚Äì is to venture outside the village and bring back much-needed merchandise such as soap, utensils, newspapers, light bulbs. Roukoz lives with Nassim's family, and it is made clear that Nassim has lost his father. Roukoz tries to fix the church speakers, and falls off his ladder, crashing into the cross and snapping it in half. Other characters include the village mayor and his wife Yvonne (Christians), the cafe-owner Amal (played by Nadine Labaki), Rabih (the village painter and Amal's love interest) and his sister, Issam (Nassim's brother) and his wife Aida, and the village priest and the village imam. The next day, the congregation is gathered in church to celebrate the Sunday mass. The priest preaches about the need to fix the church, and blames the broken cross on the wind, telling churchgoers to keep their cool and that their fellow Muslims have nothing to do with it. Some time later the imam discovers that some goats have found their way into the mosque, and urges the Muslims not to blame the Christians for what had happened. As people start to gather, however, a Muslim man blames the Christians for what has happened and a small fight ensues. The village is slowly drawn into greater violence, but the women get along beautifully and conspire together to keep their men from fighting, even hiring Ukrainian dancers to entertain their men. But as Nassim is killed in a skirmish between Christians and Muslims while on an errand in a nearby town, the women are faced with a real test of wills. In an attempt to control the situation, they drug the men by mixing hashish inside sweet pastries and remove their weapons from the village. When the men wake up, they find all the Christian women dressed in Muslim attire, and vice versa, essentially challenging their husbands and sons to hit them first if they want sectarian violence. Nassim's funeral then goes peacefully, and the movie ends with the men looking to the women for direction.

Khaled Mouzanar, Labaki's husband, composed the music for the film. Tania Saleh wrote the lyrics to all the songs in the film. The movie was released in Cannes in May 2011. Sam Nessim, who helped co- write the film with Labaki, shot the initial stills for the film and was set to be the director of photography at only 18 years old, but he was not available during the months of production due to school, so Christophe Offenstein stepped in. The film was shot in Taybeh, a village near Baalbek, because the town contains a church neighboring a mosque. Other towns were used during the shooting, including Meshmesh, Douma, and Jeita's Church Al-Saydeh.

She was most famous for the role of Violetta in La Traviata by Giuseppe Verdi, which she performed in England, France, and the United States, as well as her native Italy. After her marriage in 1863, she retired from performing, making only rare charity or courtesy appearances thereafter. Biography Photograph by Camille Silvy. Marietta Piccolomini was born Maria Teresa Violante Piccolomini Clementini in Siena, Italy on 5 March 1834. She was descended from Italian noble House of Piccolomini, and her parents were horrified at her wanting to pursue a career in opera, but she succeeded in persuading them to allow her to do so. From the age of four years, Marietta had amused herself at playing at mock theatrical representations. She used to sing duets with her mother, a skilful amateur, and she had been instructed by mezzosoprano Rosa Mazzarelli, and later trained with Pietro Romani (1791‚Äì1877), one of the first professional singing teachers in Italy.Camata (Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani) It was under his guidance that she debuted at Florence's Teatro La Pergola in January 1752, taking the title role of Donizetti's Lucrezia Borgia and later also appearing in Crispino e la comare by Luigi and Federico Ricci. In November 1752 she was engaged at Rome's Teatro Argentina, where she performed in Donizetti's Poliuto, Antonio Cagnoni‚Äôs Don Bucefalo and Verdi's I masnadieri and I Lombardi alla prima crociata. In Pisa in 1853, she sang, among others, the title role in Luisa Miller, in Reggio Emilia, the same year, Leonora in Il trovatore, and in Turin, in 1855, Violetta in La Traviata, a role in which she became especially famous.Henry Fothergill Chorley (1862) Thirty years' Musical Recollections, Vol. 2, Hurst and Blackett, London (Digitized by Google Books) The response in Turin was a spectacle not seen before in the world of entertainment. Throngs surrounded her hotel. Men tried to unharness the horses from her carriage so that they might draw it through the streets themselves but she would not permit this.Ellen Creathorne Clayton (1863) Queens of Song, Smith, Elder & Co., London (digitized by Google Books) =International career= When word of her success in Turin reached Britain, she was invited to sing the British premiere of La Traviata at Her Majesty's Theatre in London, where she appeared for the first time on May 24, 1856.According to Ellen Creathorne Clayton (p. 386), on May 5 (thus before her London debut in Traviata!) Piccolomini appeared in Lucia di Lammermoor. In fact, the date should be correctly referred to the 1857 opening performance (The Saturday Review, III, 2 May, p. 413, and 9 May 1857, p. 429). Also according to Clayton, the music had to be transposed or adapted to suit her capabilities. In spite of the doubts raised by music critics about her technical skills as a singer,Cf. for instance: The opera season, \\"The Spectator\\", 9 August 1856, Volume 29, second six months, p. 847 (accessible online as a Google ebook- gratis). audiences received her exceedingly well and she \\"was adopted at once as the pet (and afterwards how much petted!) child of Her Majesty's Theatre\\".Lumley, p. 378. On June 26, Piccolomini appeared for the first time as Maria, in La figlia del reggimento, and on July 26 in Don Pasquale. Although these performances revealed her inexperience, critics praised her dramatic ability. Following her season in England, Picolomini sang in Dublin with great success. Piccolomini's appearance in Paris in Traviata on December 6, 1856 was the first time the opera had been heard in France. Verdi tried to stop the opera from being performed at Th√©√¢tre des Italiens owing to lack of copyright for his operas in France at the time, also supporting the claims of the French holder of the rights on Alexandre Dumas's La Dame aux cam√©lias (whence the opera is drawn), but without success. Again, while critics remarked on the limitations of her voice and singing, they praised her natural talent and stage presence. When the Empress Eug√©nie heard that she had missed the most talked-about premiere in Paris, she sent word to Calzado, the director of the theatre, and a command performance was arranged for the Emperor and her. Piccolomini returned to the United Kingdom on April 21, 1857, and performed in La figlia del reggimento again and also in Don Giovanni (Zerlina), Lucia di Lammermoor and Le Nozze di Figaro (Susanna). She had been working hard to improve her technique as a result of the criticism she had received the year before. She then made a provincial tour which included Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Bath, Bristol, Cheltenham, Brighton, and other places. Then she repaired again to Dublin. In November and December she went with Giuglini on a starring tour through Holland and Germany.Arditi, p. 51. In 1858 Mademoiselle Piccolomini took part both in the first experimental winter season of Her Majesty's Theatre and in the ordinary one, revisiting some of her repertoire roles and presenting for the first time in London La zingara, a highly successful Italian version of Balfe's The Bohemian Girl (with all recitatives set to music), and Verdi's Luisa Miller, which was not however so warmly welcome.Lumley, pp. 441‚Äì442. She also debuted the roles of Amina in La sonnambula by Vincenzo Bellini\\"The Saturday Review\\", V, 23 January 1858, p. 93. and Serpina in La serva padrona by Giovanni Paisiello.\\"The Saturday Review\\", VI, 10 e 24 July 1858, pp. 45 and 84.

In June 1859 she returned to London, appearing at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in sixteen or seventeen performances, the last of which being her London debut in Il trovatore.\\"The Spectator\\", 15 October 1859, p. 20 (accessible online at archive.spectator.co.uk). After touring around the provinces as usual, she finally returned to Italy. =Marriage and retirement= In April 1860 she was persuaded by Fabio Campana's entreaties to appear for the last time at Her Majesty's Theatre in the premiere of his Almina,Arditi, p. 74. and the following month she married the Marquis Francesco Caetani della Fargna (1824‚Äì1906), settling in Florence. Thereafter she retired from the stage, taking part only in rare charity concerts or making courtesy appearances. In 1863, however, she heard of the preparations in London for some benefit concerts in honour of Benjamin Lumley, the former impresario of Her Majesty's Theatre, who had launched her international career seven years before and who was by then ruined.

They were trying to cross the Strait of Otranto, off the southern coast of Italy, in an inflatable boat, heading towards Brindisi, on the Adriatic coast of Apulia. Twenty-eight people died or were declared lost at sea, and there were only eight survivors. For Albanian emigrants, the tragedy had the second highest mortality rate for such events, after the Otranto tragedy of March 1997, when the Albanian ship Kateri i Rad√´s, smuggling clandestine emigrants, was hit by the Italian warship Sibilla, resulting in the death of 84 people.Otranto Tragedy, Session in the Court of Lecce Postponed13 roses for the victims of Otranto, after 13 years from the tragedy Unemployment, low income, and difficult living conditions persuaded people to leave Albania, especially in the 1990s. Demanding visa requirements produced great difficulties in obtaining travel visas through foreign embassies, followed by a process involving lengthy, complex, and costly procedures, claimed by some to be humiliating, and these were the main reasons suggested as leading to illegal emigration.Mirela Bogdani & John Loughlin, Albania and the European Union: the tumultuous journey towards integration I.B.Tauris and Co.

There's no more rubber dinghies and traffickers on the waters of the Republic of Albania.\\"Gazeta \\"Z√´ri i Popullit\\", 29 August 2002Archives of articles, interviews and analysis on Karaburun tragedy (in Albanian) Despite the political reforms and successes of the Albanian government in its efforts to stop illegal emigration, in early 2004 this phenomenon still existed, as evidenced by the Karaburun deaths on 9 January. It was not until some six and a half years later, on 8 November 2010, that the Council of the European Union approved visa-free travel into the Schengen Area for Albanian citizens.  Description  There were 36 people from North Albania who traveled from Shkod√´r to Vlor√´ carried in a closed van to Dh√´rmi. Each of them had paid 1500 euros to the traffickers in order to pass illegally to Italy's southern coasts. They embarked with two dinghy drivers and one trafficker, setting out at around 17:30 from the northern coasts of Dh√´rmi village on the stormy afternoon of 9 January, after it became completely dark. Half an hour after their departure both of the boat's motors stopped, possibly because of the over-load of passengers, as well as the difficult sea conditions. Returning was impossible. They were trapped by the sea that had a force of 6 on the Beaufort scale, despite being just 3 miles from Karaburun Peninsula's western shores. One of the motors started leaking fuel, burning some passengers. The people on board tried desperately to call their relatives and the police for help, and at 21:30 one of the dinghy drivers called Top-Channel TV. The boat filled with water but did not sink. Some passengers could not endure the cold and the burns and eventually died. According to the Dh√´rmi police post's chief, V. Kordhishta, at 17:40 his superiors were notified about the watercraft seen on radar, moving away at a mere 200 m from the shore. Afterwards, with other policemen, he went to the place where the embarkation occurred on the northern shores of Dh√´rmi and found an abandoned Peugeot car and some empty plastic cans of fuel. At 18:30, the radar in Vlor√´ tracked two watercraft, 3 miles off Karaburun's coast, publicly confirmed by a spokesman of the Ministry of Order during a transmission on Top-Channel. At 18:40 a patrol boat of the Delta Force unit, an inflatable dinghy of the Border Patrol and another patrol boat set off toward Dhermi. Due to the bad weather they could not progress beyond Mezokanal between Sazan Island and Karaburun Peninsula and docked in Sh√´n Jan bay, near Cape of Gjuh√´z. At 19:00 the boat's approximate coordinates were determined, and at 21:40 the Italian representatives of NATO in Durr√´s were notified. They additionally sent several watercraft and two helicopters. At 1 a.m. the search was stopped, to be resumed in the morning. A NATO helicopter, AB 212 model, reached the location of the inflatable boat at 8:30 on Saturday, 10 January. The pilot hovered over the target for nearly half an hour until a '‚ÄôCP-407'‚Äô patrol boat of the 28th Group of the Italian navy (Marina Militare) stationed in Durr√´s seaport, could arrive to save the 11 survivors. They found 21 dead bodies: 18 males and 3 females, with 7 others missing. The 21 dead bodies were transported and arrived at 1 p.m. at Albanian-Italian naval base of Sazan. At 14:20, the 11 survivors from the Guardia di Finanza's ship arrived at the Vlora seaport. The survivors were sent to the hospital for medical care and one was airlifted by helicopter to Tirana for further medical assistance. At 18:00, the 21 bodies in plastic bags arrived from Sazan Island at the morgue of Vlor√´, where police authorities barred journalists from entering. = Contradictions = Several contradictions surround the entire event. The survivors on board stated that two people had died from injuries and burns from the probable blast of one of the motors. Meanwhile, one of them was seriously burned and sent by helicopter to Tirana for specialized treatment. Captain Santarelli, chief of the Guardia di Finanza clearly stated that there were no signs of fire on the boat. It was speculated the motor had suffered an unexpected small blast without spreading fire, instead just leading to fuel leakage. Giuseppe da Salvo, the pilot of the helicopter who was the first to notice the inflatable boat with survivors and the 21 deceased victims on board, expressed his surprise when learning that three fire extinguishers in good condition were found on the boat. He departed from Durr√´s at 21:00 when the wind's speed reached , while flying a helicopter would normally be prohibited. After flying for two hours over the presumed location of the vessel on the Ionian sea, he turned back without finding the target. The next morning the boat was located. Meanwhile, the survivors deny the existence of any fire extinguishers on board. = Second boat = The existence of two watercraft was publicly reported late at night by a Ministry of Public Order representative through a national TV channel, referring to what the radar in Vlore had detected. Nevertheless, after the 11 survivors were found, it was officially reported there was only one inflatable boat with a total number of 39 passengers. The Democratic opposition deputies claimed the concealment of another boat by the government officials. Nikoll√´ Mhillaj, the founder and chair of the Association 9 Janar asked for efforts being made to pursue the issue at the highest level of justice and the clarification of the existence of the second boat.Anila Dushi Tragjedia e Karaburunit, prind√´rit akuza qeveris√´, www.shekulli.com.al, 10 January 2009 Director of Criminal Police of the General Directorate of State Police, Mr. Sokol Bizhga, attested in his testimony for the Prosecution of Vlor√´ that another inflatable boat was found a few hours before Guardia di Finanza's watercraft rescued the 11 survivors: ‚ÄúAt the dawn of 10 January, around 06:30 we noticed at a distance about four miles from Gjiri i Dafin√´s (Laurel bay ) a rubber dinghy.

I contacted the operating room of Vlora and after thirty minutes a watercraft, probably of the Interforce unit came to place. Ten minutes later a helicopter arrived.

The second driver's brother was the owner of the boat. Another relative, Chief of the Circulation Police Department of Vlor√´ was also involved and all were sentenced or imprisoned. The opposition leader deputies of the Democratic party accused the government of strong implication in the tragedy and in involvement in clandestine trafficking.

The Atlanta Baroque Orchestra gave its premiere concert in January, 1998. The first Director of the ABO was lute and theorbo player Lyle Nordstrom, who departed in 2003. As several guest directors were brought in for concerts, John Hsu, noted performer on the viola da gamba and baryton, took the title of Artistic Advisor, becoming Artistic Director in July 2004; he continued through the 2008-2009 season. From 2004 through 2011, the Resident Director was founding member Daniel Pyle, harpsichordist and organist, and also Instructor of Music at Clayton State University and Organist and Choir Director at the Anglican Church of Our Saviour in Atlanta. Violinist, dancer and choreographer Julie Andrijeski became Artistic Director in February, 2011. The ABO usually performs four to six concerts per year, concentrating on orchestral works and concerti, but often featuring chamber pieces, vocal cantatas, and other works with vocal soloists. The range of works performed by the ABO stretches back to the beginnings of Baroque style around the year 1600, while their core repertoire is centered in music from many composers who worked in the Middle Baroque era of Pachelbel and Corelli (the late 1600s) and the High Baroque era of Vivaldi, Bach, Handel and Telemann (up through 1750). They have also performed the music of Mozart and Haydn, and the string symphonies of Mendelssohn from the 1820s. Several concerts have featured the orchestra accompanying Baroque dancers. Most performers with the ABO are university instructors and professors with advanced degrees, and all are specialists in authentic performance practice, playing replicas of the actual instruments used in the Baroque era. Such an ensemble produces a sound that is quite different from that of ensembles that use modern orchestral instruments. Baroque violins, violas and cellos use strings of sheep gut and bows of an earlier design, rather than the louder string instruments strung with steel strings played by conventional orchestras. Likewise, the Baroque flute is made of wood and does not have keys, while the Baroque horn (often called the natural horn) has no valves. Other instruments featured in a Baroque orchestra include the harpsichord and lautenwerk, viola da gamba and bass viol, recorder, Baroque bassoon, lute and theorbo. Because of the relatively small number of musicians who specialize in playing Baroque-era instruments, the ABO consists of a smaller core of regular musicians who live in the Atlanta area, supplemented for each concert by performers and featured soloists brought in from throughout the United States of America and occasionally from overseas. Guest artists and directors have included leading Baroque and Classical-period performers: violinists Stanley Ritchie, Monica Huggett, Sergiu Luca, and Dana Maiben; Paul O'Dette, lute; Aldo Abreu, recorder; soprano Julianne Baird; Stephen Rickards, countertenor; oboist Matthew Peaceman; and Baroque dancers Paige Whitley-Bauguess and Thomas Baird. Signatory concerts of the ABO include the first performances in Atlanta on period instruments of: * Vivaldi's The Four Seasons on September 27, 1998 at Clayton State University's Spivey Hall. * J. S. Bach's Passion according to St. John on November 11, 2000 at Emory University * Handel's Messiah on November 23, 2002 * Marc-Antoine Charpentier's Te Deum on November 16, 2001, using a new orchestration completed by musicologist Charles Brewer and a year- long celebration of the 250th anniversary of the birth of Mozart in 2006. In 2009, they devoted concerts to the symphonies of Haydn, celebrating the 300th anniversary of his birth. In addition to its own concerts, the orchestra has performed in collaboration with other organizations throughout the Southeast, including at conferences of the National Flute Convention, the American Musicological Society, and the Southeast Historical Keyboard Society. The ABO has performed on the campuses of Emory University, the University of Georgia, Florida State University, Kennesaw State University, Clayton College and State University, Oglethorpe University, and Valdosta State University. The ABO has performed in venues in Birmingham, Alabama, Pensacola, Florida, Rome, Georgia, and Conyers, Georgia. The orchestra has also partnered with choral organizations including the Emory Concert Choir, Atlanta Choral Artists, the Schola Cantorum of Atlanta, Clayton State Collegiate Chorale, Clayton Camerata, Dekalb Choral Guild, the Westminster Choir, Chandler Choraliers, and choirs from Peachtree Road United Methodist Church in Atlanta, Intown Community Church in Atlanta, and Independent Presbyterian Church, Birmingham, Alabama. To date the Atlanta Baroque Orchestra has not released any recordings.

The theory's best known branch, status characteristics theory, deals with the role that certain pieces of social information (e.g., race, gender, and specific abilities) play in organizing these hierarchies. More recently, sociologist Cecilia Ridgeway has utilized the theory to explain how beliefs about status become attached to different social groups and the implications this has for social inequality. Basic concepts =Scope= The theory attempts to explain: \\"When a task- oriented group is differentiated with respect to some external status characteristic, this status difference determines the observable power and prestige within the group whether or not the external status characteristic is related to the group task\\". In other words, the theory attempts to explain how hierarchies are created in small group interactions (with a shared goal) based on status cues. Specifically, this theory explains unequal distribution of participation, influence, and prestige between members of the group. This theory has implications for macro- and population-level hierarchy and inequality between groups. In general, expectation states theory is meant to explain the way that interpersonal status hierarchies work. \\"Interpersonal status hierarchies\\" refers to the emergence of differential levels of social esteem and influence that occurs when groups of people interact. Research has found that several factors may influence the ways that status hierarchies emerge; however, the driving force seems to be implicit assumptions that group members hold about each other members' level of ability for completing the task at hand. Expectation states theory originated in the sociology literature and started with observations about differences in participation, influence, and prestige across members small groups, and these differences varied as a function of status characteristics. The primary goal of expectation state theory as applied to gender is to explain how observed differences between social groups become the basis for inequality in everyday social encounters. While expectation states theory describes the development of status beliefs broadly, and can be applied to the study of any social groups, it is most commonly used to examine and explain inequality as it relates to gender. =Forebears= In general, expectation states theory is meant to explain the way that interpersonal status hierarchies work (Berger et al., 1972). \\"Interpersonal status hierarchies\\" refers to the emergence of differential levels of social esteem and influence that occurs when groups of people interact. Research has found that several factors may influence the ways that status hierarchies emerge; however, the driving force seems to be implicit assumptions that group members hold about each other members' level of ability for completing the task at hand. Expectation states theory originated in the sociology literature and started with observations about differences in participation, influence, and prestige across members small groups, and these differences varied as a function of status characteristics. Ridgeway (2011) also draws on status construction theory which states that as various groups (e.g. men and women) interact with each other over time, status hierarchies will often cause one group to be seen as more competent than the other. If this effect is repeated over time, the group with the higher status hierarchy will become more influential and the group with the lower status hierarchy will be more likely to give in to what the higher status group wants. There are two types of status characteristics in status characteristics theory. Diffuse status characteristics operates in a culture if one state (i.e., male) is valued more than the other, and that state is expected to be more competent at specific tasks, and they are expected to generally be more competent at a wide variety of tasks. Specific status characteristics do not have the third requirement (i.e., men are generally better than women at wide range of tasks; Berger et al., 1977). Aspects of expectation state theory also draw on reward expectations theory which focuses on how status characteristics, abilities, and task accomplishment are related to expectations for rewards (Berger, Fiske, Norman, & Wagner, 1985). Reward expectations theory suggests that individuals who receive greater rewards are expected to be more competent than group members who do not receive high level of rewards. =Basic assumptions= Berger et al., (1972) identify the following assumptions: Assumption 1. (Activation) Given a situation, if a diffuse status characteristic in a task situation is a social basis of discrimination between p' (persons) and o (other) then the diffuse status characteristic is activated in the task situation. Assumption 2. (Burden of proof) If diffuse status characteristic is activated in the task situation and has not been previously dissociated from a characteristic predictive of success, and if there is no other social basis of discrimination between p' and o, then at least one consistent component of diffuse status characteristic will become relevant to characteristic predictive of success in task situation. Assumption 3. (Assignment) If any components of an activated diffuse status characteristic are relevant to characteristic predictive of success, p will assign states of characteristic predictive of success to self and other in a consistent manner. Assumption 4. (Basic Expectation Assumption) If p assigns states of characteristic predictive of success to himself/herself and o consistent with the states of an activated diffuse status characteristic, then p's position relative to o in the observable power and prestige order will be a direct function of p's expectation advantage over o. In addition to the assumptions identified by Berger et al. (1972), there are implicit assumptions inherent in expectation state theory. First, that men and women see their gender differences as salient. This is something that could differ based on the task that the group is working on (or what their common goal is), their cultural norms (are they more liberal or more conservative) may be more relevant than if they were working on a less gendered task (e.g., a, and even how strongly members themselves identify with their gender norms. If men and women are working on a highly gendered task (for example, a marketing team working on an advertising campaign for lipstick), expectation states then advertising campaign for flu vaccinations). Similarly, expectation states theory may be less relevant when referring to a group of individuals who do not conform to gender norms versus those that do. Expectation states theory makes a number of unique assumptions in accounting for gender inequality. First, barriers to women's advancement to upper-level positions of authority are due to gender's status element, rather than something inherent to gender itself. Inequality is thus due to basic evaluative assumptions about women's competence as opposed to that of men. Therefore, the predictions expectation states theory makes about inequality are the same for any two groups about which evaluative assumptions can be made about one group as compared to the other. The theory can therefore account for not only gender inequality, but also racial and other types of inequality. A second and related assumption is that all status assumptions resulting in inequality associate the advantaged group with higher levels of skill or resources (Webster & Foshci, 1988). In other words, status beliefs imply not only group differences but also group inequality. With regards to gender, status beliefs hold men to have higher levels of instrumental competence (Eagly & Mladinic, 1994). Third, expectation states theory makes no assumptions regarding gender differences in individual ability to lead or achieve high levels of success. Thus, expectation states theory grounds hierarchical inequality in the sex categories themselves rather than individual strength, competence, or lactation status. Finally, expectation states theory assumes that gender status beliefs affect performance expectations (and therefore result in inequality) only when gender is salient to the situation/task at hand. Thus, gender inequality will typically not surface except in mixed-sex groups, particularly if they are working on a task that is relevant to stereotypical gendered competence. =Related theories= The predictions made by expectation states theory are in many ways similar to those made by Eagly's Social-Role Theory. The key distinguishing feature of expectation states theory is that it is able not only to make predictions about the extent to which particular inequalities are due not only to gender but also to other status relevant differences. A second related theory is Glick and Fiske's (1999) theory of stereotype content. These theories make similar predictions about how gender inequality is most likely to surface in contexts of cooperative interdependence and the \\"prescriptive element\\" of gender beliefs. However, the distinguishing feature here is that Expectation States Theory holds this prescriptive element to relate not only to gender but to any group distinction that may foster inequality. =Locations and contexts of application= Close relationships: Families and dyads In families or other close relationships, an individual's legitimate expertise would be recognized, which might help with implicit attributions based on gender. However, status hierarchy and expectation states theory may also influence close relationships, particularly if the situation is new or unusual. Status beliefs may also operate within the couple/family in public more than when they are in private since people may act in accordance with how they think others will perceive them. Overall, whether expectations state theory operates within close relationships might depend on how egalitarian the views of the individuals in the family are. For example, a highly egalitarian couple would relate to each other based on their legitimate experience. A less egalitarian couple may fall into \\"traditional\\" husband and wife roles because their status beliefs may serve as a crutch for how to act in their new and unfamiliar situation. School, work, other legal/formalized social institutions This is what expectation state theory focuses on (gender and status hierarchies in the workplace). Expectation states is based on how group interactions are influenced by implicit status characteristics. If someone holds legitimate expertise, she may be able to overcome the negative attributions associated with her gender, but this may not always be the case. Culture broadly defined, including popular culture, media Expectation states theory emerges based on cultural stereotypes and status beliefs. Therefore, it is more that culture influences expectation states/status hierarchy and not the other way around. Although, there is that self-fulfilling prophecy aspect of expectation states, so perhaps it is cyclical in the lens of culture as a whole as well. Formation of status beliefs At the heart of expectation states theory is the concept of status beliefs. Status beliefs are defined as \\"widely held cultural beliefs that link greater social significance and general competence, as well as specific positive and negative skills, with one category of a social distinction compared to another\\". Status beliefs arise from repeated interactions among members of different social groups, in which members of one group are observed to have some sort of structural advantage over members of another group. That is, they are perceived to have advantages in influencing members of other groups, due to possessing greater resources (such as money or prestige). If such perceived differences are observed across multiple interactions, in multiple contexts, they may become ingrained as a status belief. In such cases, individuals take them to heart and continue to spread such beliefs in future interactions. Over time and repeated interactions, such beliefs can give rise to a hierarchy, in which individuals from groups with perceived greater status are granted power, authority, and influence over groups perceived to have lower status. The construction and enacting of status beliefs typically appears consensual, in that both the perceived higher and lower status groups take part in their formation and propagation. Gender According to expectation states theory, gender status beliefs attribute greater competence and social status to men than women. Similar to Eagly's Social-Roles Theory, expectation states theory holds that gender stereotypes are prescriptive in nature, meaning the stereotype regards not only the way things are but the way they should be. Coupled with the theory's stance that status beliefs are consensual (shared by men and women), the prescriptive element leads women to act in ways that are commensurate with the status belief. In summary, status beliefs, which hold men to possess greater competence, have a prescriptive element. Due to the notion that status beliefs are widely held, they have great power in determining the behavior of both men and women in mixed gender settings. Expectation states theory views individuals not only as a man/woman but as an aggregate whole of all identities which bestow them status in the eyes of others. The theory holds that while people are sex-categorized in almost every situation, they are also categorized according to other markers as well (e.g.,. race, education, or sexual orientation). A key tenet of the theory is that it not only includes traditional demographic differences as important contributors to status beliefs but also important aspects of an individual's identity such as education, title, and social role. Depending on which status characteristics are salient at a given time, gender and such other identities will combine to influence the ultimate performance expectations held by the individual and observers. In summary, an individual's behavioral and status differences are determined not only by his/her gender, but they are a function of the aggregate expectation of all identities relevant to a given task. Facets of gender Core gender identity (one's essential sense of self as female, male, other, none of the above) Expectations theory does not really address issues of core gender identity. However, it does explain how people come to believe that there are essential differences based in gender: Beliefs about essential differences between genders are an important part of the theory because people draw on these beliefs (mostly unconsciously) in important ways. Within small groups that share a collective goal, group members need to decide who in the group will be most instrumental in achieving the goal (i.e., who is the most competent, has the most useful information or experience, etc.). These essential beliefs come into play when group members decide whom they should listen to (men) and who should listen and provide support (women). Even if members of the subordinate group do not personally endorse the status beliefs, they still assume that others will treat them according to these widely shared beliefs and therefore must take these beliefs into account in their own behavior. (Seachrist & Stangor, 2001) Ridgeway et al. (1998) found that repeated encounters with people who consistently differed from them in pay, influence, and group distinction caused participants to form beliefs that influence-advantaged group members were more respected and competent than disadvantaged group members. Ridgeway and Erickson (2000) found that status beliefs spread when people were treated in ways consistent with the beliefs. Sexuality, including sexual orientation Expectations states theory does not directly address this. To the extent that sexual orientation is a concealed identity (at least to others), sexual orientation may not be within the scope of expectations states theory. There may be value in exploring the intersectionality between sexual orientation and gender in expectation states theory. However, since expectation states theory typically focuses on work groups this may be less applicable (people may be unlikely to share their sexual orientation with their coworkers) than other attributes such as race. Gender stereotypes and other culturally-embedded representations of gender Drawing on social role theory (Eagly, 1987), and the stereotype content model (Fiske, Cuddy, Glick, & Xu, 2002), expectation state theory argues that, when deciding (unconsciously) who is most instrumental to achieving the goal, people rely on the content of stereotypes and status beliefs. Women are stereotypically communal and lower status than men. There has been empirical support for an implicit hierarchy gender stereotype. Mast (2004) found that the association between men and hierarchical and between woman and egalitarian was stronger than the associate between men and egalitarian and women and hierarchical. The implicit hierarchy gender stereotype is stronger for men than it is for women, which means men end up with more status and power than women. These status beliefs are \\"widely held cultural beliefs that link greater social significance and general competences, as well as positive and negative skills, with one category of social distinction compared to another\\" (Ridgeway, 2001 p. 638). Because these are so ingrained in culture, individual accomplishments cannot overcome the disadvantages that come with being in a lower status group. Thomas-Hunt and Phillips (2004) found that female leaders who held expertise were less influential than male leaders, and that having expertise actually decreased how expert others perceived them to be. These differences were also reflected in group performance (groups with male experts outperformed those with female experts). Diversity within and between groups, particularly intersections of social identity Expectation states theory does not address intersectional issues. However, because the theory argues that people draw on information based on their identities, intersectionality is relevant. For instance, how do people process identities that are dually marginalized (black women)? Are these women (based on cumulative status characteristics) going to be less influential than white women? In other words, do people process group members identities cumulatively/additively? There have been studies that look at difference between different intersections. For example, Dugger (1998) found that African American women typically endorse more moderate forms of status beliefs than White women. Biernat & Kobrynowicz (1997) looked at differences in minimum standards and ability standards in devalued groups and looked at male/female differences as well as black/white differences. However, they conducted two studies, each looking at a different grouping. This would have been a prime example of a study that may have benefited from an intersectionality framework. Origins of gender Nature vs. Nurture This theory does not deal with nature; it deals with \\"nurture.\\" It emphasizes people's associations throughout the lifetime between group members and stereotype and status content. Even then, it does not deal with \\"nurture\\" in the sense of one's upbringing (by parents, relatives, etc.) but more in the sense of the culture that one grows up in. How do we \\"get\\" gender? Expectation states theory does not touch on the development of gender identity. Again, it is more about how other perceive and responses to that perception. Takes for granted that gender develops and once someone has it, they bring it to/reproduce it through the situation or context that they are in. Gender is explained as an external, diffuse status characteristic that is used in groups to create expectations about an individuals performance capacity. The theory says we \\"get gender\\" by learning what to associate with ours and others' various stereotype and status cues. \\"Ultimate explanations of gender\\" Expectation states theory does not touch on \\"ultimate explanations\\". The theory says that social role theory explains the ultimate origin, which is that physical differences, lead to the perception of psychological differences via observations of divisions of labor by sex. Support =Experimental tests= One characteristic of expectation states theory that sets it apart from many other psychology or sociological theories of inequality is that it has been tested empirically. In particular, recent experimental studies have tested and found support for the development of status beliefs relating to gender. In particular, a study by Ridgeway and colleagues placed men and women into a fabricated decision-making scenario, in which members of one group were manipulated to have greater resources than another. Results showed that both men and women were more likely to listen to ascribe greater authority to individuals in the high status group, suggesting that both men and women take part in the formation and propagation of status beliefs. The researchers also found that, when women were in the high status group, they would perceive themselves to have legitimate authority, but would be less likely to act on it than would male participants. It was suggested that this hesitation may arise out of a perceived greater social consequence for women who wrongfully exert authority than for men. This has clear, practical implications for gender inequality. Similarly, in a second part of this study, the researchers found that women in both the perceived high and perceived low status groups were unlikely to resist a partner's influence, whereas males in the high status group were much more likely to displace resistance than males in the low status group. =Evidence for gender and leadership emergence= Much of the research evidence on Expectation States Theory regards women and leadership emergence. In order for such research to support Expectation States Theory, five pieces of evidence must be presented. First, men should show more signs of emerging as leaders in mixed groups working on a gender-neutral task. This would support the theory's claim that the higher performance expectations for men should lead them to act and be accepted accordingly. Second, these same results should be stronger in mixed-sex groups working on a masculine task because the status beliefs should be even more salient. Third, women should show slightly higher levels of emergence when the task is feminine in nature. This is because women are attributed higher competence in such situations. Fourth, in order to confirm Expectation States Theory's claim that status itself causes these differences rather than something inherent to gender, similar effects should be observed from other status characteristics such as race. Finally, differences in leadership emergence should be mediated by competence perceptions. First, there is a good amount of evidence showing that men in mixed sex groups show more signs of leadership emergence. In a study of 24 mixed sex dyads performing a non-gendered task, men showed higher levels of power through verbal and nonverbal communication. Similarly, Wood and Karten observed that men engaged in more task-related behaviors such as opinion- giving while working in four-person mixed-sex groups. A recent meta-analysis found that men are more talkative than women in general but that the difference is even greater in mixed-sex groups. Finally, a meta-analysis by Eagly and Karau showed that men were more likely to be selected for leadership roles than women. However, a recent study by Burke, Stets, and Cerven found that even when women were selected into a formal managerial role they used more of the resources they had at their disposal. The researchers attributed this finding to women's \\"trying harder\\" to succeed in light of self- perceptions that they were of lower competence than men in similar positions. The second piece of evidence was that men should show even more signs of leadership emergence when the task is masculine in nature. Dovidio and colleagues' study is particularly supportive of this second necessary piece of evidence. First, men showed higher levels of verbal and nonverbal communication than women on a gender-neutral task. However, when the dyads worked on a masculine task (discussing changing oil in a car), the difference became ever greater. The study also provided support for the third piece of evidence (i.e. women should show slightly greater signs of leadership emergence when task is feminine in nature) because when the topic shifted to feminine in nature women actually exhibited greater power. Providing further evidence that status beliefs are central to these phenomena, several studies have shown that no differences appear when the task is performed in same sex groups. Finally, differences in leadership emergence should be mediated by competence perceptions. This evidence is that in a study by Wood and Karten. The researchers displayed that status based assumptions regarding men's superior competence mediated the tendency for men to evidence higher levels of leadership emergence in mixed gender settings. This study further supported the notion that it is status, not inherent strengths/weakness of gender differences, which foster gender inequality. As an additional note, there is also considerable research evidence that evaluations of women's performance in leadership roles mirrors the effects found in the previously discussed literature on leadership emergence. Indeed, men Eagly, Karau, & Makhijani found that men were rated as more effective overall, and that the effect was stronger for masculine tasks. Also consistent with the previously described findings, women were evaluated as more effective in feminine settings. Similarly, a recent study of men and women performing both masculine and feminine tasks found that women were only received similar performance evaluations to men if their leadership status was legitimated through a title. =Methods= Qualitative, experimental and correlational studies are all used to test the predictions of expectations states theory. In the development of the theory, Berger et al. (1972) draw from qualitative studies and correlational studies to try to reconcile mixed findings. Then they use small groups in experimental studies to test subsequent predictions. In her review, Ridgeway (2001) cites both experimental small groups studies (like the ones in Berger et al., 1972) and correlational studies. Overall, the favored method seems to be experimental small groups studies, but correlational methods are also used. Other social groups As previously suggested, expectation states theory does not apply to gender exclusively. In support of this, empirical evidence supports the double standard predicted by Ridgeway, whereby in order to prove their competency, lower status groups must achieve higher levels of performance than higher status groups. A number of studies confirm that double standards emerge not only for gender, but also for other social categories, such as race. Practical implications =Macro-level applicability= In general, much of the research regarding expectation states theory does not speak to the larger question of whether the theory can account for macro level gender inequality. However, a recent study by Brashears utilized an innovative methodology to show that large scale cross national trends are consistent with the predictions of expectation states (or status construction) theory. The study used the frequency with which respondents indicated their best friend to be female as a surrogate for status. They found that individuals were more likely to report their best friend to be a female in countries which have a higher percentage of females working in supervisory positions. This supports the notion that status beliefs regarding gender are weaker (or at least less salient) in nations in which women possess more authority. While the evidence was not causal, it does provide an indication that expectation states theory does have the potential to explain large scale gender inequality. =Implications for everyday life= Expectation states theory focuses on how status beliefs are enacted in everyday life. While the theory does address the origins of status belief, the focus is instead on how these status beliefs influence people's attitudes, perceptions, and behavior. This clearly has practical implications in any situation in which status distinction can be particularly salient. In such situations, where members of one group are perceived to have greater status and legitimacy than members of another, expectation states theory can be useful in predicting how members of both the higher and lower status groups will act and treat one another. This theory describes how individuals with higher status tend are more likely to be listened to, receive more positive evaluations, and exert greater influence than individuals with lower status. Conversely, individuals in lower status positions will be more likely to defer to those with high status. With regard to gender, the theory generally predicts that men will tend to have basic advantages in mixed group settings, even when performing a gender-neutral task. In general, men will be expected to exercise the authority conferred by their perceived structural advantages that cross social contexts (e.g., higher pay), and will be more likely to be recognized and rewarded for doing so. In exercising such power based on status, they will often be expected to talk more, make more suggestions, and display more assertive gestures that will women. In the traditional workplace, where many traditional roles as masculinized, Expectation states theory suggests this would form the basis for gendered inequality. In the workplace, another clear example of the applicability of expectation states theory is in predicting backlash against female leaders in an organization. According to this theory, since women are often ascribed a position of lower status than men, when a woman in a leadership role exercises authority, expectation states theory predicts that there may be a backlash against her, on the grounds that her power is perceived to be illegitimate. Expectation states theory can be used to explain (and be used as a means to counter) situations such as these. =Implications for social change= According to expectation states theory (e.g., Ridgeway & Bourg), inequality arises when members of one group are perceived to have greater status and prestige than members of another group. This distinction occurs when members of a particular social group systematically perceive that some members have a structural advantage (such as more money, knowledge, or other resources). These systematic perceptions develop as individuals share and reinforce these beliefs among one another, legitimizing such beliefs as members of both high and low status groups act on their ascribed social status. By understanding how these beliefs form and lead to certain groups becoming marginalized, expectation states theory provides an avenue for breaking this pattern. According to this theory, positive social change would involve disruption of the formation of these status beliefs, thereby reducing the formation of status distinctions that drive inequality. Further reading Berger, J., Cohen, B.P., & Zeldich, M. Jr. (1972) This article introduces the idea of diffuse status characteristics playing a role in how small groups organize into hierarchy. The authors summarize and interpret mixed results of past studies and generate a new theory (i.e., expectation states theory). They determine that, within small groups with a collective goal, certain characteristics are used as information about who will be most \\"instrumental\\" in achieving the goal, and thus who will be influential over others. In the absence of a characteristic that provides specific information about who will be most instrumental, group members rely on \\"diffuse status characteristics\\", which is essentially to rely on stereotypic beliefs. The authors then find support for their new theory in a set of lab experiments. Brashears Using an annually administered international survey, the research examined associations between goal objects and a surrogate indicator of status to see if they exhibited patterns consistent with predictions from expectation states theory. In order to measure status, the study used an item from the survey which asked respondents to indicate whether their best friend was a man or a woman. Rationale for the use of this indicator was based on the tendency individuals have to desire association with individuals of greater status than they themselves have. Therefore, it was determined that the if a higher percentage of respondents in a given nation indicated a woman to be their best friend, then women likely had attained a higher level of status in that nation. Goal objects (an item that is desirable regardless of how easily it can be exchanged) in the study included the proportion of the full-time labor force that was female and the proportion of the supervisor force that was female. Although no association was found between status and labor force, there was a positive association between status and the proportion. Other findings included that participating in the workforce and working as a supervisor decreased the likelihood that an individual would select a woman as their best friend. In summary, the article provided initial evidence that macro-level associations between indicators of status and goal attainment are consistent with the predictions of expectation states theory. Dovidio, Brown, Heltman, Ellyson, & Keating The researchers performed a lab study which used 24 mixed sex dyads assigned to discuss masculine, feminine, and gender-neutral topics. The authors examined differences between men and women in their display of verbal and nonverbal behaviors based on the gender-type of the task the dyad was performing. Consistent with the predictions of expectation states theory, men exhibited higher levels of both verbal and nonverbal behaviors on the masculine and gender neutral tasks. Similarly, women exhibited greater power through verbal behaviors such as time speaking and nonverbal behaviors such as looking while speaking. These results were consistent with expectation states theory's predictions, providing initial support that the theory may help explain gender differences in leadership emergence. Driskell, J. E., & Mullen, B. (1990) This meta-analysis tests the fundamental premise of expectation states theory, which says that status cues create performance expectations, which then lead to interaction inequalities. Critics of the theory argue that performance expectations could be \\"epiphenomenal\\", and do not serve as a mediator. The meta-analysis finds support for the theory (i.e., status predicts expectations, and expectations predict behavior, but status has little effect on behavior beyond that which can be attributed to expectations). Harkness (2016) This article examines discrimination in lending markets. Researcher found a significant relationship between status expectations and lenders‚Äô assessments of applicants. Lenders were found tot at least rely, in some part, to status assumptions. This article addressed possible solution or deterrence from discrimination based on status characteristics by eliminating certain demographics such as names and other personal information. The results suggest that white women and black men were significantly less funded than black women and, white men and white women have better outcomes than black men. Kalkhoff, W., & Thye, S. R. (2006) This is a meta analysis provides support for expectation states theory's proposition that status cues inform performance expectations and thus affect social influence. Given a history of varying effect sizes, the authors test the theory and examine whether experimental protocols (e.g., use of computers) affect the outcomes. Mast, M. S. (2004). This is an empirical research study that used an Implicit Association Test to examine implicit gender hierarchy. The authors found that there was indeed an implicit gender stereotype. This stereotype resulted in a strong association between \\"men\\" and \\"hierarchical\\" and between \\"female\\" and \\"egalitarian\\". Ridgeway (2001) This article reviews expectations states theory as it applies to women's ability to influence others and achieve leadership positions (in domains that are not stereotypically feminine). It reviews expectations states theory in general (i.e., where stereotypes and status beliefs originate, how these beliefs function prescriptively). Then it considers the implications for women (i.e., how these psychological processes put competent women at a disadvantage, how competent women who violate the hierarchy are disliked). Ridgeway, C. L. (2009) Although this article does not explicitly focus on expectation states theory, it draws on many of the same principles. This review piece discusses how gender provides the primary cultural framework to coordinate behavior and organize relationships. The article focuses on how the background effects of gender influence the context of various organizational and institutional practices. Ridgeway, Backor, Li, Tinkler, & Erickson The researchers examined the effects of gender on the formation and propagation of status beliefs in a two-part experimental study. In the first part, male and female participants were assigned to either a low or high resource (pay) condition. In two successive trials of a cooperative decision making, it was modeled that individuals in the high pay condition had the greater authority. In a third trial, participants were asked to complete a measure assessing their status beliefs regarding themselves and their partners, and were then asked to complete an additional decision making task. It was found that both men and women formed status beliefs that ascribed greater legitimate authority to individuals with greater resources. Furthermore, it was found that men were more likely than women to assert their authority when they were part of the perceived \\"favored\\" group. This was thought to be because there are more severe perceived social consequences for women who assert authority illegitimately. In further support of this, a second phase of the study found that men in the perceived higher status group were less likely to submit to a partner's influence than men in the perceived lower status group; however, there was no such status group effect for women, suggesting that gender itself was influencing participants' willingness to resist influence. Thomas-Hunt, M. C., & Phillips, K. W. (2004) This is an empirical research study that examines how gender differences influences expertise perceptions in groups. The results suggest that women were viewed as less influential when they possessed expertise and that true expertise actually decreased others' perceptions of their level of expertise. Groups with female leaders underperformed groups with male leaders. Expertise was viewed as a positive trait for male leaders. Walters, A.S & Valenzuela I. (2019) This research examines the expectations that Latino men have on themselves and other Latinos. Researches examine the use of stereotypes and expectations that are based on characteristics related to topics such as work ethic, sexuality and masculinity. Some findings explain tendencies for participants to rely on respect as a key characteristic and status level when interacting with their peers. Glossary Interpersonal status hierarchy :When groups of people interact, some people are given more social esteem and influence than others. The emergence of these differences creates a hierarchy within the group. Status beliefs :\\"Widely held cultural beliefs that link greater social significance and general competences, as well as positive and negative skills, with one category of social distinction compared to another\\" (Ridgeway, 2001 p. 638). Diffuse status characteristics :A cue that indicates a person belongs to a particular social group (e.g., a person looks female; a person seems to have lower SES) and, with recognition of that cue, the activation of the associated stereotypic traits. Diffuse status characteristics operate if one set of associated stereotypic traits (e.g., for men: strategic, leader-like) is valued more than the others (e.g., for women: supportive, nurturing) and individuals associated with the more valued traits are expected to be more competent at specific tasks. Specific status characteristics: :A cue that indicates a person, regardless of social group, has some level instrumentality for the specific goal at hand. For example, a person who is introduced as an expert in her field (relevant to the group's goal) will have more status than other members of the group who do not have expertise, regardless of the fact that she is female (a group that has lower social status). Similar to diffuse status characteristics, but does not include the third requirement of one group being expected to be more competent at a wide variety of tasks.

Life Wan Yu's origins were not recorded in history. He served as the Prefect (‰ª§) of Wucheng County (ÁÉèÁ®ãÁ∏£; present-day Huzhou, Zhejiang) during the reign of the third Wu emperor, Sun Xiu ( 258‚Äì264). During this time, he befriended Sun Hao, who was then the Marquis of Wucheng. Later, he was promoted to be a Left Ceremonial Officer (Â∑¶ÂÖ∏Ëªç). In 264, when Sun Xiu became critically ill, he entrusted his eldest son and heir apparent Sun Wan (Â≠´©Ö¶) to the care of Puyang Xing (ÊøÆÈôΩËàà), his Imperial Chancellor. After Sun Xiu's death, however, Puyang Xing did not assist the underage Sun Wan in becoming the new emperor. Around the time, as Eastern Wu faced several threats (e.g. external invasion, internal uprisings), the officials hoped for an older and more mature emperor to lead them. Wan Yu then used the opportunity to recommend Sun Hao to Puyang Xing and the general Zhang Bu ‚Äì the regents in the interim period ‚Äì to be the new emperor, in the hope that he would be rewarded later. He told Puyang Xing and Zhang Bu that Sun Hao was wise, decisive and similar to Sun Ce (a founding father of Eastern Wu), and managed to persuade them to help Sun Hao. Puyang Xing and Zhang Bu, in turn, succeeded in convincing Sun Xiu's widow, Empress Zhu, to let Sun Hao inherit the throne. After ascending the throne, Sun Hao appointed Wan Yu as a Central Regular Mounted Attendant (Êï£È®é‰∏≠Â∏∏‰æç), along with Wang Fan, Lou Xuan and Guo Chuo (ÈÉ≠ÈÄ¥). Later into his reign, Sun Hao turned out to be a cruel, extravagant and inept emperor, so Puyang Xing and Zhang Bu started regretting their decision to put him on the throne. When Wan Yu heard about their complaints, he secretly reported them to Sun Hao, who had them executed along with their families. Among his colleagues, Wan Yu got along well the most with Lou Xuan and the least with Wang Fan. He particularly detested Wang Fan as he believed that Wang Fan leveraged on his close relationship with Sun Hao to gain the emperor's favour. Wan Yu and another official, Chen Sheng (Èô≥ËÅ≤), often slandered Wang Fan in front of Sun Hao. Over time, Sun Hao also gradually hated Wang Fan more and more because the latter often spoke up against his outrageous behaviour. Sun Hao finally found an excuse to execute Wang Fan in 266. In 266, Sun Hao split the office of Imperial Chancellor into two, and appointed Wan Yu as Right Imperial Chancellor (Âè≥‰∏ûÁõ∏) and Lu Kai as Left Imperial Chancellor (Â∑¶‰∏ûÁõ∏). The reason for splitting the office was that he wanted Wan Yu to balance against the influential and more senior Lu Kai. In the spring of 267, Sun Hao ordered Wan Yu to supervise military affairs in Jing Province and station at Baqiu (Â∑¥‰∏ò; present-day Yueyang, Hunan), effectively replacing Lu Kai, who had been performing that task for years. In 268, Sun Hao decided to wage war against Eastern Wu's rival state, the Jin dynasty, so he ordered Wan Yu and Shi Ji to lead the Wu forces in Jing Province to attack the Jin dynasty. Wan Yu led troops to attack Xiangyang Commandery (Ë•ÑÈôΩÈÉ°; present-day Xiangyang, Hubei), but was defeated and driven back by the Jin general Hu Lie (ËÉ°ÁÉà). After Lu Kai died in 269, Sun Hao summoned Wan Yu back to Jianye (Âª∫Â∫∑; present-day Nanjing, Jiangsu), the Wu imperial capital, in the following year. During this time, Wan Yu recommended Lou Xuan to serve as a Captain of the Imperial Guards. In the winter of 270/271, despite strong objections from his subjects, Sun Hao launched a military campaign against the Jin dynasty and set off from Niuzhu (ÁâõÊ∏ö; present-day Dangtu County, Anhui). Along the way, the Wu army encountered a snowstorm and could not advance. During this time, the Wu soldiers started grumbling and complaining; there was even talk among them about defecting to the Jin dynasty. Before Sun Hao ordered the troops to retreat back to Eastern Wu, Wan Yu had already secretly made arrangements with the generals Ding Feng and Liu Ping (ÁïôÂπ≥) to return to Wu without informing the emperor. When Sun Hao found out, he was extremely furious but he did not immediately take action against them because the three of them held important positions in his government. After Ding Feng died of illness later that year, Sun Hao exiled his family to Linchuan (Ëá®Â∑ùÈÉ°; around present-day Linchuan District, Fuzhou, Jiangxi). In the following year, Sun Hao secretly instructed a servant to serve poisoned wine to Wan Yu, but the servant added too little poison so Wan Yu survived. Nevertheless, upon realising that the emperor wanted him dead, Wan Yu took his own life. One month later, Liu Ping also died in distress and frustration. Sun Hao exiled Wan Yu's family to Luling Commandery (Âª¨ÈôµÈÉ°; northwest of present-day Taihe County, Jiangxi).

His brother Lonzo \\"Tommy\\" Ayers eventually went on to play professional baseball from 1947‚Äì49. Ayers enlisted for service in the United States Army for World War II on July 10, 1943 at Fort McPherson in Atlanta.  Career  Ayers started his professional career playing for the Shelby Cardinals in the 1937 season.

It was successively the seat of the Gresham and Leveson-Gower families and is now preserved by a charitable trust for the nation. The house has its origins in a 16th-century house, which was built by Sir John Gresham on the site of a predecessor. The mostly Tudor house was demolished and rebuilt in the 18th century, before being refronted in 1826. Finally a tower was added in 1856. History In the Middle Ages, Titsey was owned by the Uvedale family.Granville William Gresham Leveson-Gower (1856), Notices of the family of Uvedale of Titsey, Surrey, and Wickham, Hants, pp. 3-4 It was then an important house in the area, and its Uvedale owners were High Sheriffs of Surrey several times between 1393 and 1464, and also several times High Sheriffs of Hampshire between 1388 and 1493. The Gresham family reached the peak of their power and wealth in the sixteenth century, and Sir John Gresham, a rich City of London merchant, acquired Titsey from the heirs of John Bourchier, 2nd Baron Berners, to whom it had been granted by Henry VIII. Gresham built a new house there near to the parish church, on the site of an older house. He was Lord Mayor of London in 1547. The house and estate passed through several generations of the Gresham family, who were created Baronets by Charles II at the time of his Restoration (1660). Sir John Gresham's heir was William Gresham, whose son was Sir Thomas Gresham (died 1630). His son and heir was Sir Edward Gresham. The successive baronets were Sir Marmaduke Gresham, 1st Baronet (1627-1696), Sir Edward Gresham, 2nd Baronet (1649-1709), Sir Charles Gresham, 3rd Baronet (1660-1718), Sir Marmaduke Gresham, 4th Baronet (1700-1742), Sir Charles Gresham, 5th Baronet (died 1750), and Sir John Gresham, 6th and last Baronet (1735-1801). Through the marriage of the heiress of the last Gresham, the house passed to the Leveson Gowers, a branch of the family of the Dukes of Sutherland. A Tudor house on the site was demolished and rebuilt by the last Gresham baronet in the 18th century, then in 1826 was given new fronts designed by William Atkinson. A tower by Philip Charles Hardwick was added in 1856.Country Life, vol. 196, issues 27-30 (2002), p. 115 Thomas Gresham by More, c. 1554 John Preston Neale's Views of the Seats of Noblemen and Gentlemen, in England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland (1821) notes that \\"The Mansion... stands in a beautiful dell formed by a range of lofty chalk hills sheltering it from the north.\\"J. P. Neale, Views of the Seats of Noblemen and Gentlemen, in England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, vol. 4 (Sherwood, Neely, and Jones, 1821), p. 126 A Topographical History of Surrey (1844) says of the house - Many of the Uvedales are buried in the garden of Titsey Place, which contains the former parish graveyard. The last Gresham of Titsey pulled down the ancient parish church in 1776 and incorporated its site into his park. In 1865, a large yew-tree marked the location of the former church. Sir Henry Leveson Gower (1873‚Äì1954), who was born at Titsey Place, was England cricket captain in 1909-1910.Alan Gibson, The Cricket Captains of England (1989), p. 112 Frederick Leveson-Gower (1871‚Äì1946) also played first-class cricket. The Leveson Gowers remained at Titsey until Thomas Leveson Gower died in 1992. By his Will, a charitable trust was established to preserve the house and gardens for the benefit of the public. The remainder of the estate was left to his heir, David Innes, who was also appointed Governor of the charitable trust. Present day =House= The house is especially noted for its fine collection of family portraits, many of which are hung in the main entrance hall. Such noted artists as Sir Joshua Reynolds and Peter Lely are represented. The new dining room has four paintings of Venice by Canaletto. The panelled sitting-room has a notable antiquarian interior and the gallery bedroom has an impressive Georgian style. =Gardens= After being left in a run-down state by the Army after World War II, the majority of the gardens were restored by Thomas Smith and his team. Smith also built up a very impressive orchid collection and grew fruit and vegetables in the kitchen-garden for the estate and for the greengrocers in nearby Oxted. Since 1992, the house and remainder of the gardens have been restored and the kitchen-garden changed to a more Victorian style. Both open to the public in the summer.

It is native to Brazil, and its venom is extremely toxic. It's the most dangerous scorpion in South America and responsible by the most fatal cases.  Description  Adult specimens typically measure between 5‚Äì7 cm (2‚Äì3 in) in length. As suggested by its common name, coloration consists of pale-yellow legs (8 in total) and pedipalps, with a darker shade of yellowish brown on the trunk, fingers, and tip of the tail. Like other members of the family Buthidae, T. serrulatus has a bulbous tail, often carried in a characteristic forward curve over the back, which is segmented, with prominent ridges and serrations. The tail is tipped with a venom-injecting barb capable of immobilizing prey or delivering defensive strikes.  Geographic range  The species is endemic to Brazil and widely found throughout the country, including the states of Bahia, Cear√°, Esp√≠rito Santo, Goi√°s, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, Paran√°, Pernambuco, Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Norte, Rio Grande do Sul, Rond√¥nia, Santa Catarina, S√£o Paulo, Sergipe, and Distrito Federal. \\"Due to deforestation and growing urbanization, this species is becoming more and more present,\\" according to Rog√©rio Bertani in an interview with the British newspaper The Guardian.Scorpion deaths on rise in Brazil as arachnid adapts to urban life He is a scientist and scorpion specialist at the Butantan Institute in S√£o Paulo. \\"I personally think that the problem will continue to grow.\\" By 2018 there was a notable increase in the number of T. serrulatus scorpions living in the urban spaces of S√£o Paulo, contributing to an increase in reported scorpion stings in Brazil from 12,000 in 2000 to 140,000 by 2018. An abundance of prey, notably cockroaches, and shelter along with a lack of predators is believed to be a cause of the increase in scorpion numbers in Brazilian cities.  Feeding  It has a diet of insects, such as cockroaches, and is suited to life in sewers and trash heaps in urban areas. Having a low metabolic rate, it can survive for months without eating.  Reproduction  The species is usually parthenogenetic.  Venom  = Potency = In Brazil, scorpions are credited with causing the highest incidence of human envenomations when compared to those caused by all other venomous animals, including snakes and spiders, combined.Brazil Ministry of Health. \\"Acidente por Animais Pe√ßonhentos.\\" ACIDENTE POR ANIMAIS PE√áONHENTOS.\\" Sistema de Informa√ß√£o de Agravos de Notifica√ß√£o (SINAN). 2017 data. Retrieved 2019-03-06. http://tabnet.datasus.gov.br/cgi/tabcgi.exe?sinannet/cnv/animaisbr.def. Reported incidents involving scorpions: 123,964; snakes: 28,466; spiders: 32,714. With mortality rates ranging from 1.0 to 2.0% among children and elderly persons, T. serrulatus is responsible for more medically significant accidents than any other scorpion in the country. Most stings occur in urban areas, inside or near homes, with greater frequency in the south and southeast during the warm and rainy months, but with little or no seasonal variability in the north, northeast, and center-west. = Effects = In mild cases, localized pain is the primary symptom. Tityus serrulatus has an excitatory neurotoxin that attacks the autonomic nervous system, causing the release of adrenaline, noradrenaline and acetylcholine, causing an immense variety of symptoms in the victims; clinical effects may include hyperglycemia, fever, priapism, agitation, hypersalivation, tachycardia, hypertension, mydriasis, sweating, hyperthermia, tremors, gastrointestinal complications (diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomits) and pancreatitis. Convulsions and coma are relatively rare, but can occur. Death usually results from pulmonary edema and cardiorespiratory failure. Deaths can occur between 1-6 hours, or 12-14 hours, depending on the age group, the person's state of health and the quantity of injected venom. According to a nationwide epidemiological study of scorpion accidents that was conducted from 2000 to 2012, there were 482,616 accidents and 728 deaths reported in Brazil during that period. All of the fatal cases were attributed to the genus Tityus, and T. serrulatus, in particular, was believed to be responsible for the vast majority of scorpion-related deaths considered by the study.

Lauro followed Ascoli promoted to Serie A, however, he left for fellow Serie A team Reggina on 31 August 2005. In January 2006, Reggina terminated his contract and Lauro returned to Ascoli as an understudy of left back Cristiano Del Grosso. The team finished as the tenth place that season. In July 2006, he was transferred to Serie B team Cesena for undisclosed fees. =Cesena= At Cesena, Lauro became a regular starter of the team, as left back and a centre-back (in first season). He missed two months from late September to October 2007 due to injury. He then returned to his old position ‚Äì left back on 2 November against Lecce. That season Cesena finished as the bottom. He follow the team relegated to Lega Pro Prima Divisione in 2008 and promoted back to Serie B in 2009 as champion and promoted again to Serie A in 2010 as runner-up. In 2010‚Äì11 season, Cesena signed Yuto Nagatomo as left back, and Lauro played his second Serie A season, again as backup. After the team failed to win since round 3, Nagatomo was moved to right back to replace Luca Ceccarelli and Lauro became a starting left back again. In May 2011 he signed a new 2-year contract. =Ternana = After a six-year playing career at Cesena, Lauro left the club for Serie B team Ternana Calcio on 16 July 2012. International career Lauro played once for Italy U16 in a friendly match.

In classical antiquity, the muscle cuirass ()Also found as \\"muscled cuirass\\" or \\"lorica musculata\\". The contemporary Latin phrase lorica musculata appears not to be used among scholars, but will be found at reenactment websites. The word musculatus (nor any verb from which it might derive) does not exist in Classical Latin, according to the Oxford Latin Dictionary, nor in late antiquity, according to the Latin Dictionary of Lewis and Short, which includes patristic writers of the early Christian era., anatomical cuirass, or heroic cuirass is a type of cuirass made to fit the wearer's torso and designed to mimic an idealized male human physique. It first appears in late Archaic Greece and became widespread throughout the 5th and 4th centuries BC.M. Treister, \\"The Theme of Amazonomachy in Late Classical Toreutics: On the Phalerae from Bolshaya Bliznitsa,\\" in Pontus and the Outside World: Studies in Black Sea History, Historiography, and Archaeology (Brill, 2004), p. 205; Charlotte R. Long, The Twelve Gods of Greece and Rome (Brill, 1987), p. 184. Originally made from hammered bronze plate, boiled leather also came to be used. It is commonly depicted in Greek and Roman art, where it is worn by generals, emperors, and deities during periods when soldiers used other types. In Roman sculpture, the muscle cuirass is often highly ornamented with mythological scenes. Archaeological finds of relatively unadorned cuirasses, as well as their depiction by artists in military scenes, indicate that simpler versions were worn in combat situations. The anatomy of muscle cuirasses intended for use might be either realistic or reduced to an abstract design; the fantastically illustrated cuirasses worn by gods and emperors in Roman statues usually incorporate realistic nipples and the navel within the scene depicted.  Use  vase from Apulia (c. 325 BC)Treister, \\"The Theme of Amazonomachy,\\" p. 205. The cuirasses were cast in two pieces, the front and the back, then hammered. They were a development from the early Archaic bell- shaped cuirass, weighing about 25 pounds.Mikhail Y. Treister, Hammering Techniques in Greek and Roman Jewellery and Toreutics (Brill, 2001), pp. 115‚Äì118; Richard A. Gabriel and Karen S. Metz, From Sumer to Rome: The Military Capabilities of Ancient Armies (Greenwood, 1991), p. 52. Examples from the 5th century BC have been found in the tombs of Thracians, whose cavalrymen wore them.Treister, Hammering Techniques, p. 115. The earliest surviving depiction in Greek sculpture seems to be an example on a sculptural warrior's torso found on the acropolis of Athens and dating around 470 ‚Äì 460 BC. The muscle cuirass is also depicted on Attic red-figure pottery, which dates from around 530 BC and into the late 3rd century BC. From around 475 to 450 BC, the muscle cuirass was shorter, covering less of the abdomen, and more nipped at the waist than in later examples. It was worn over a chitoniskos. In neo-Attic art, the muscle cuirass was worn over a longer chiton.Long, The Twelve Gods, p. 184. Tomb II at Vergina contained an iron muscle cuirass that was decorated with embossed gold.Treister, Hammering Techniques, p. 118. The Italian muscle cuirass lacked the shoulder-guards found on Greek examples.Nicholas Sekunda, Republican Roman Army 200‚Äì104 BC (Osprey Publishing, 1996), p. 46. Examples among the Samnites and Oscans sketch a blockier torso more roughly than the anatomically realistic Greek pieces.Nic Fields, Roman Battle Tactics 390‚Äì110 BC (Osprey Publishing, 2010), p. 7 with images. Many examples come from graves in Campania,Sekunda, Republican Roman Army 200‚Äì104 BC, p. 8. Etruria, and elsewhere in southern Italy. Polybius omits the muscle cuirass in his description of the types of armor worn by the Roman army, but archaeological finds and artistic depictions suggest that it was worn in combat. The monument of Aemilius Paulus at Delphi shows two Roman infantrymen wearing mail shirts alongside three who wear muscle cuirasses.Sekunda, Republican Roman Army 200‚Äì104 BC, pp. 8 and 46. They were worn mostly by officers, and may have been molded leather as well as metal, with fringed leather (Pteryges) at the armholes and lower edge.Pat Southern, The Roman Army: A Social and Institutional History (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 157. The muscle cuirass is one of the elements that distinguished a senior officer's \\"uniform\\".Hugh Elton, \\"Military Forces,\\" in The Cambridge History of Greek and Roman Warfare (Cambridge University Press, 2007), p. 62.  Artistic qualities  The Doryphoros of Polykleitos = Cuirasse esth√©tique = The sculptural replicating of the human body in the muscle cuirass may be inspired by the concept of heroic nudity, and the development of the muscle cuirass has been linked to the idealized portraiture of the male body in Greek art.Jason K√∂nig, Athletics and Literature in the Roman Empire (Cambridge University Press, 2005), p. 103, providing further references in note 27. Kenneth Clark attributes the development of an idealized standard musculature, varied from the facts of nature, to Polykleitos: = Decoration = Gorgoneion on an Athena Parthenos Hellenistic rulers added divine emblems, such as thunderbolts, to the pteruges. Another conventional decoration is the gorgoneion, or Medusa's head, on the upper chest, and often vegetative motifs on the pectorals.Elfriede R. Knauer, \\"Knemides in the East? Some Observations on the Impact of Greek Body Armor on 'Barbarian' Tribes,\\" in Nomodeiktes: Greek Studies in Honor of Martin Ostwald (University of Michigan Press, 1993), pp. 238‚Äì239. One of the elements of iconography that identify the Greek Athena and the Roman Minerva, goddesses who embodied the strategic side of warfare, was a breastplate bearing a gorgoneion (see Aegis). Other deities, particularly the war gods Ares and Mars, could be portrayed with muscle cuirasses. = Roman emperors = Muscle cuirass from the Augustus of Prima Porta Among freestanding sculptures portraying Roman emperors, a common type shows the emperor wearing a highly ornamented muscle cuirass, often with a scene from mythology. Figures such as winged victories, enemies in defeat, and virtues personified represent the emperor as master of the world. Symbolic arrangements this elaborate never appear on Greek cuirasses.Knauer in Nomodeiktes p. 239. The cuirass on the famous Augustus of Prima Porta is particularly ornate. In the center, a Roman officer is about to receive a Roman military standard (aquila) from a bearded \\"barbarian\\" who appears to be a Parthian. The Roman, who has a hound at his side, is most often identified as a young Tiberius, and the scene is usually read as the return in 20 BC of the standards lost at the Battle of Carrhae in 53 BC. The anatomically realistic navel (Greek omphalos, Latin umbilicus) is placed between the two central figures, slightly below ground level in relation to the feet and centered above the personification of Earth, positioned over the abdomen.Lawrence Keppie, The Making of the Roman Army: From Republic to Empire (University of Oklahoma Press, 1984), p. 230. Her reclining position, cornucopia, and the presence of suckling babies is common to other goddesses in Augustan art who represent peace and prosperity. Other figures include a lyre-playing Apollo riding a griffin, Diana on the back of a hind, and the quadriga of the Sun at the top.Paul Zanker, The Power of Images in the Age of Augustus (University of Michigan Press, 1988, 1990), pp. 175, 189‚Äì190.

Douds, 339 U.S. 382 (1950), is a 5-to-1 ruling by the United States Supreme Court which held that the Taft‚ÄìHartley Act's imposition of an anti-communist oath on labor union leaders does not violate the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, is not an ex post facto law or bill of attainder in violation of Article One, Section 10 of the United States Constitution, and is not a \\"test oath\\" in violation of Article Six of the Constitution. Background The American Communications Association (ACA) was founded in 1931 as the American Radio Telegraphists Association (ARTA) by Mervyn Rathbone.Lowitt, Interpreting Twentieth-Century America: A Reader, 1973, p. 452.The ARTA should not be confused with the United Radio Telegraphists Association, a similar union in the U.S. founded in 1917 but which had disbanded by 1922. See: May-Stewart, Handbook of American Trade-Unions: 1936 Edition, 1936, p. 278. The union represented telegraphists and radio operators (on land and at sea) in the United States. The union had previously been involved in a Supreme Court case regarding the use of strikebreakers in strikes (NLRB v. Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co., 304 U.S. 333 (1938)), which it had lost. In 1937, the union changed its name to the American Communications Association and affiliated with the newly formed Congress of Industrial Organizations.Downey, \\"Telegraph Messenger Strikes and Their Impact on Telegraph Unionization,\\" in The Encyclopedia of Strikes in American History, 2009, p. 516. A majority of the union's members were strongly left-wing, and most the union's leaders were members of the Communist Party USA (CPUSA)‚Äîwith the union effectively under the control of the CPUSA.Stark, \\"Some Unions Will Sign Anti-Communist Papers,\\" New York Times, August 31, 1947; Busky, Communism in History and Theory: Asia, Africa, and the Americas, 2002, p. 155; Starobin, American Communism in Crisis, 1943-1957, 1975, p. 143; Rabinowitz, Unrepentant Leftist: A Lawyer's Memoir, 1996, p. 31. The United States Congress enacted the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) on June 27, 1935, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed it into law on July 5.\\"Both Houses Clear Wagner Labor Bill,\\" New York Times, June 28, 1935; \\"Roosevelt Signs the Wagner Bill as 'Just to Labor',\\" New York Times, July 6, 1935. In 1947, Congress amended the NLRA by enacting the Labor‚ÄìManagement Relations Act (better known as the Taft-Hartley Act) on June 23, 1947, overriding President Harry S. Truman's veto.Stark, \\"Industry, Labor Sharply Divided,\\" New York Times, June 21, 1947; White, \\"Truman Plea Fails,\\" New York Times, June 24, 1947. Section 9(h) of the Taft-Hartley Act required leaders of labor unions to file an affidavit with the National Labor Relations Board affirming that they were not members of the Communist Party USA and did not advocate the violent overthrow of the United States federal government.Abernathy and Perry, Civil Liberties Under the Constitution, 1993, p. 260. If a union had an elected leader who did not file such an affidavit, that union would lose the protection of the NLRA. ACA leaders categorically refused to sign the anti-communist affidavits on the grounds that the oaths violated their First Amendment rights. On October 29, 1947, Charles T. Douds, regional director of the National Labor Relations Board in New York City, barred the American Communications Association from appearing on an NLRB- supervised union organizing election (its very first action under the new Taft-Hartley anti-communist oath provisions).Stark, \\"NLRB Blocks Union Bargaining Right,\\" New York Times, October 30, 1947.\\"High Court Will Rule on Two Cases Involving Taft Act Oath and Eisler,\\" New York Times, November 9, 1948. The ACA sued to have the provision declared unconstitutional as a violation of its leaders' First Amendment rights.Loftus, \\"High Court Delays Red Clause Ruling,\\" New York Times, January 14, 1949. On June 29, 1948, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held, in a 2-to-1 decision written by Judge Thomas Walter Swan, that Section 9(h) did not impermissibly impose on union members' First Amendment rights.\\"Final Court Test on Taft Bill Seen,\\" New York Times, June 30, 1948. Attorney Victor Rabinowitz appealed the case to the Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari on November 8, 1949. Although the Court was due to hear oral argument on January 13, 1949, it delayed this in order to take on another case (United Steelworkers of America v. National Labor Relations Board) with almost identical issues. Argument was rescheduled for February 28, 1949, but did not occur until October 11 so that both cases could be heard together. Justice Douglas did not participate in the case after being severely injured in a horse-riding accident. Three of the Court's most liberal justices did not participate in the decision.Rabinowitz, Unrepentant Leftist: A Lawyer's Memoir, 1996, p. 54.Wiecek, History of the Supreme Court of the United States..., 2006, p. 547. Justice William O. Douglas did not participate because he had nearly been killed in a horseback-riding accident earlier in the year, and was still convalescing at his home in Arizona.Christopher, Chances of a Lifetime: A Memoir, 2001, p. 20; Douglas, The Court Years, 1939-1975: The Autobiography of William O. Douglas, 1981, p. 95. Associate Justice Tom Clark had been President Truman's Attorney General, and had overseen the prosecution of the ACA.Frankel, History in Dispute: The Red Scare After 1945, 2000, p. 151; Wiecek, History of the Supreme Court of the United States..., 2006, p. 546. Although he joined the Court on August 24, 1949,\\"Truman Sees Clark Sworn In By Vinson at the White House,\\" New York Times, August 25, 1949. Clark had recused himself to his prior involvement in the case. Associate Justice Wiley Blount Rutledge, a staunch liberal and strong advocate for civil rights,Newman, The Yale Biographical Dictionary of American Law, 2009, p. 473. had died unexpectedly of a stroke on September 10, 1949, at the age of 55.\\"Justice Wiley Rutledge Dies of Brain Hemorrhage at 55,\\" New York Times, September 11, 1949. His successor, 59-year-old Sherman Minton, a former Democratic Senator from Indiana and a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, was nominated as his replacement on September 16, 1949, but was not sworn in until October 12.Wood, \\"Minton Named to High Court,\\" New York Times, September 16, 1949; \\"Minton Is Confirmed For Court, 48 to 16,\\" Associated Press, October 5, 1949; \\"Minton Sworn In As Supreme Court Justice,\\" New York Times, October 13, 1949. His arrival on the Court came two days after oral argument, and he was not able to participate in the decision.As it turned out, Minton was one of the Court's more conservative members. See: Eisler, The Last Liberal: Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., and the Decisions That Transformed America, 1993, p. 76. Decision =Majority ruling= Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson wrote the plurality decision for the majority, joined by Associate Justices Stanley Forman Reed and Harold Hitz Burton. Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter joined in all but Part VII of the majority opinion. In Part I of the decision, Vinson first reviewed the relevant language in the Taft-Hartley Act, as well as that language which provided for processing of affidavits and imposition of penalties in the event no affidavits were filed in the time permitted.American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 385. He also reviewed the justification for upholding the constitutionality of the NLRA, which was to remove obstructions to interstate commerce.American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 387. He also reviewed Congress' justification for passing the Taft-Hartley Act, which also attempted to remove impediments to interstate commerce‚Äîincluding the so-called \\"political strike,\\" in which \\"legitimate trade union objectives\\" were subordinated by the Communist Party to political objectives.American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 387-389. In Part II, Vinson posed what a plurality of the court believed was the key question:American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 390. > We are, therefore, neither free to treat ¬ß 9(h) as if it merely withdraws a > privilege gratuitously granted by the Government, nor able to consider it a > licensing statute prohibiting those persons who do not sign the affidavit > from holding union office. The practicalities of the situation place the > proscriptions of ¬ß 9(h) somewhere between those two extremes. The difficult > question that emerges is whether, consistently with the First Amendment, > Congress, by statute, may exert these pressures upon labor unions to deny > positions of leadership to certain persons who are identified by particular > beliefs and political affiliations. Part III of the decision addressed Congress' power to prevent political strikes through the Commerce Clause, whether the remedy designed was reasonable, and whether the threat posed by the Communist Party was so unique in its use of political strikes and in advocacy of violence that Congress could single it out. Vinson answered all questions affirmatively.American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 390-391. Citing In re Summers, 325 U.S. 561 (1945); Clarke v. Deckebach, 274 U.S. 392 (1927); and Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81 (1943), among others, Vinson noted that the Constitution often permitted otherwise irrelevant beliefs, personal traits, or employment status to be infringed upon in certain, limited circumstances.American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 391-392. The question addressed in Part IV of the decision was whether the Communist Party presented such circumstances. The unions had argued that a \\"clear and present danger\\" test be applied to the legislation, as this was a First Amendment issue, but could not agree on how to do so.American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 393. Vinson rejected this test as mechanical.American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 394-395. But Congress had not concluded in enacting the Taft-Hartley Act that expressing communist beliefs was a danger; rather, Congress had wished to eliminate impediments to interstate commerce.American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 396. The problem with political strikes, Vinson asserted, was that rather than allowing speech to combat speech in the \\"marketplace of ideas\\", strikes constitute force and coercion which Congress has every authority to regulate. One of the unions had argued that political strikes did not constitute such an imminent danger as to pass constitutional scrutiny, but Vinson rejected this once more as a mechanical application of an inapt test.American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 397-398. Rather, Vinson argued, the Constitution permits infringement of constitutionally protected rights when a sound truck invades the privacy of the home (Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U.S. 77 (1949)), unauthorized parades disrupt traffic (Cox v. New Hampshire, 312 U.S. 569, (1941)), the health of children is at stake (Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158 (1944)), or the provision of public services is affected (United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75 (1947)).American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 398-399. Advocating a balancing of interests and citing Reynolds v. United States, 98 U. S. 145 (1878) (an individual's religious beliefs cannot be accepted as proof of a felony act without evidence of commission of the crime), Vinson instead proposed a balancing test.American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 399-400. Part V of the decision discussed whether political strikes posed such a significant issue as to permissibly infringe on freedom of speech. Vinson refused to substitute the Court's judgment for the congressional determination that this was the case.American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 400-401. In accepting the authority of government to promote strong unions, Vinson observed, the Court had repeatedly also accepted the authority of government to infringe in sometimes substantial ways upon individual liberties.American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 401-402. The Taft-Hartley Act's penalties, Vinson held, were not direct infringements on the freedom to speak and thus not as onerous as infringements the Court had approved in the past.American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 402-405. Vinson rejected the suggestion that the statute had not been narrowly drawn. Although legislation could have been enacted which made political strikes themselves unlawful (rather than require anti-communist affidavits), Vinson asserted that:American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 406. > ...the legislative judgment that interstate commerce must be protected from > a continuing threat of such strikes is a permissible one in this case. The > fact that the injury to interstate commerce would be an accomplished fact > before any sanctions could be applied, the possibility that a large number > of such strikes might be called at a time of external or internal crisis, > and the practical difficulties which would be encountered in detecting > illegal activities of this kind are factors which are persuasive that > Congress should not be powerless to remove the threat, not limited to > punishing the act. Part VI of the decision discussed whether the statute impermissibly targeted the Communist Party as the sole political party seeking the violent overthrow of the United States government. If the statute had penalized anyone who advocated violent overthrow of the government, Vinson held, there would be new constitutional doubts raised.American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 406-407. But it was the Court's long-held tenet that statutes should be construed constitutionally wherever possible.American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 407. Subsequently, Vinson interpreted Section 9(h) narrowly as barring from union office those who actually advocated overthrow of the government and not those who (for example) believed it would happen without their assistance.American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 407-408. Vinson reiterated that the balancing of interests in Part V had found the infringement on free speech permissible.American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 408-412. But how did this reconcile with Reynolds v. United States? Because, Vinson said, \\"Insofar as a distinction between beliefs and political affiliations is based upon absence of any 'overt act' ... the act of joining the Party is crucial. ... courts and juries every day pass upon knowledge, belief and intent‚Äîthe state of men's minds‚Äîhaving before them no more than evidence of their words and conduct, from which, in ordinary human experience, mental condition may be inferred.\\"American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 410-411. In Part VII, Vinson address whether Section 9(h) was unconstitutionally vague and/or was a bill of attainder or ex post facto law. Vinson admitted that, hypothetically, the language of the Act might be construed as vague. But in accordance with the Court's long-held rule, he construed the Act narrowly and asserted that there was no vagueness.American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 413. Although the unions had held the Act was a bill of attainder under United States v. Lovett, 328 U.S. 303 (1946); Ex parte Garland, 71 U.S. 333 (1867); and Cummings v. Missouri, 71 U.S. 277 (1867), Vinson observed that these cases punished past actions whereas Section 9(h) punished only future conduct. Nor did the Act run afoul of Article VI of the Constitution: \\"...the mere fact that ¬ß 9(h) is in oath form hardly rises to the stature of a constitutional objection. All that was forbidden was a 'religious Test.' We do not think that the oath here involved can rightly be taken as falling within that category.\\"American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 414-415. The judgment of the district court was affirmed.American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 415. =Concurrence= Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter concurred with the majority opinion except as to Part VII. Frankfurter argued that constitutional questions should be decided as narrowly as possible.American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 416. He asserted that \\"it would make undue inroads upon the policymaking power of Congress\\" to deny the government the right to prevent political strikes and disruptions to interstate commerce so long as it does not do so in an arbitrary way or infringes on unrelated rights.American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 417-418, quoted at 417. However, despite his agreement with nearly all of the majority's reasoning in Parts I-VI, Frankfurter held that portions of Section 9(h) over impermissibly overbroad.American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 419. Section 9(h) \\"ask[s] assurances from men regarding matters that open the door too wide to mere speculation or uncertainty. It is asking more than rightfully may be asked of ordinary men to take oath that a method is not 'unconstitutional' or 'illegal' when constitutionality or legality is frequently determined by this Court by the chance of a single vote.\\"American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 420. The safeguards of the judicial system, Frankfurter asserted, were \\"too tenuous to neutralize the danger\\" to First Amendment freedoms. Section 9(h) simply goes too far, he said, in demanding that an oath taken today‚Äîeven if well-considered, sincere, and seriously undertaken‚Äîis predictive of all future behavior and belief.American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 420-421. > I cannot deem it within the rightful authority of Congress to probe into > opinions that involve only an argumentative demonstration of some > coincidental parallelism of belief with some of the beliefs of those who > direct the policy of the Communist Party, though without any allegiance to > it. To require oaths as to matters that open up such possibilities invades > the inner life of men...American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 > U.S. 382, 422. Frankfurter acknowledged, however, that only these parts of Section 9(h) were invalid, and he would have remanded the case back to the district court with instructions for the union officers to obey only those constitutionally sound provisions. =Concurrence/Dissent= Associate Justice Robert H. Jackson concurred in part and dissented in part. Jackson held that the critical distinction was the nature of the Communist Party: \\"If the statute before us required labor union officers to forswear membership in the Republican Party, the Democratic Party or the Socialist Party, I suppose all agree that it would be unconstitutional. But why, if it is valid as to the Communist Party?\\" But \\"the Communist Party is something different, in fact, from any other substantial party we have known, and hence may constitutionally be treated as something different in law.\\"American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 423. Jackson reviewed at length the reasons why the Communist Party was unique: It constituted a minority which advocated the seizing of power through non-majoritarian means, it was a political party controlled by a foreign government, it was dedicated to violence as the means of seizing power (including \\"occasional terroristic and threatening methods, such as picketing courts and juries, political strikes and sabotage\\"), it sought to achieve its violent ends by controlling the labor movement (control it must conceal in order to be effective), and it considers all its members \\"agents\\" of the party (unlike loosely-knit \\"native\\" parties).American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 425-433, quoted at 429-430. Jackson equated the power of Congress to protect a union from domination by the Communist Party equal to the power Congress had to prevent a union from being dominated by an employer.American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 433. The Taft-Hartley Act did not prevent unions from governing themselves or union members from electing Communists as its officers, but rather ensured transparency in governance and elections (thereby ensuring self-governance as well).American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 434. Jackson agreed with the majority that the Act did not infringe free speech, but rather merely withdrew the protection of the NLRA from unions which exercised their transparent choice to elect Communists as leaders. Jackson saw the chilling effect on free speech to be incidental:American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 434-435. > I suppose no one likes to be compelled to exonerate himself from connections > he has never acquired. I have sometimes wondered why I must file papers > showing I did not steal my car before I can get a license for it. But > experience shows there are thieves among automobile drivers, and that there > are Communists among labor leaders. The public welfare, in identifying both, > outweighs any affront to individual dignity. However, did Congress have the \\"power to proscribe any opinion or belief which has not manifested itself in any overt act\\"?American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 436. That raised much more serious constitutional questions, Jackson said. He agreed that \\"The law sometimes does inquire as to mental state, but only, so far as I recall, when it is incidental to, and determines the quality of, some overt act in question.\\"American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 437. Citing Cramer v. United States, 325 U.S. 1 (1945), Jackson observed that the Constitution barred punishment even of the very serious crime of treason unless there was some overt act. But under the majority's decision, Jackson said, \\"since Congress has never outlawed the political strike itself, the Court must be holding that Congress may root out mere ideas which, even if acted upon, would not result in crime.\\"American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 438. That was anathema to the Constitution. Agreeing that the Bill of Rights was not a suicide pact (as the majority had pointed out), Jackson nonetheless concluded that Congress had narrower, just as effective means of preventing the violent overthrow of the government than attempting to regulate thought. \\"I think that, under our system, it is time enough for the law to lay hold of the citizen when he acts illegally, or in some rare circumstances when his thoughts are given illegal utterance. I think we must let his mind alone.\\"American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 444. Jackson would have upheld the power of Congress to require disclosure of past acts or membership in the Communist Party, but overturned any parts of the Act that called for a disclosure of belief.American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 445. =Dissent= Associate Justice Hugo Black dissented. The First Amendment does not allow the government to regulate beliefs, Black asserted, and yet the majority admitted that this is exactly what Section 9(h) does.American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 446. Despite the majority's lengthy citation of cases, Black said, \\"No case cited by the Court provides the least vestige of support for thus holding that the Commerce Clause restricts the right to think.\\" Black found that Section 9(h) did indeed impose a \\"test oath\\" on union leaders, and the Constitution explicitly barred such oaths.American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 4446-449. He rejected the majority's claim that the First Amendment was not offended since only a small number of people were affected. The very nature of \\"the First Amendment is its protection of each member of the smallest and most unorthodox minority.\\"American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 448. Furthermore, Black said, the majority's decision does not prevent the government from \\"barring Communists and their suspected sympathizers from election to political office, mere membership in unions, and, in fact, from getting or holding any jobs whereby they could earn a living.\\"American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 449. He also found offensive the majority's belief that the Supreme Court exists to protect individual liberty. That claim \\"springs from the assumption that individual mental freedom can be constitutionally abridged whenever any majority of this Court finds a satisfactory legislative reason. Never before has this Court held that the Government could for any reason attaint persons for their political beliefs or affiliations. It does so today.\\" That Congress had concluded from testimony that the Communist Party was a threat to national security was irrelevant, he said, for Democrats could testify the same thing about Republicans and thus ban Republicans from union office just as effectively.American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 449-450. Such reasoning was offensive to the idea of constitutionally protected liberties, Black said:American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 450. > Under today's opinion, Congress could validly bar all members of these > parties from officership in unions or industrial corporations; the only > showing required would be testimony that some members in such positions had, > by attempts to further their party's purposes, unjustifiably fostered > industrial strife which hampered interstate commerce. Nor was Justice Jackson's claim that the Communist Party was foreign- controlled a valid reason for imposing test oaths. Test oaths were imposed in 16th century England because Protestant rulers feared papal control of their Roman Catholic subjects, Black noted.American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 450-451. Even Thomas Jefferson was once accused of having more loyalty to France than the United States.American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 451. The Constitution expressly barred test oaths because of injustices such as these, Black said. Black also held that \\"Guilt should not be imputed solely from association or affiliation with political parties or any other organization, however much we abhor the ideas which they advocate.\\"American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 452. Addressing the majority's \\"suicide pact\\" idea, Black asserted that the First Amendment's tolerance of anti-democratic ideas was what protected the nation from disaster: \\"...the postulate of the First Amendment is that our free institutions can be maintained without proscribing or penalizing political belief, speech, press, assembly, or party affiliation. This is a far bolder philosophy than despotic rulers can afford to follow. It is the heart of the system on which our freedom depends.\\"American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 452-453. Citing DeJonge v. Oregon, 299 U.S. 353 (1937), Black noted that a unanimous Court had already struck down laws which banned citizens from attending Communist Party meetings.American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 447. It should strike down the relevant portions of the Taft-Hartley Act as well, he concluded. Assessment The penalties imposed on the ACA by Section 9(h) crippled the union. In May 1949, the Congress of Industrial Organizations ordered its member unions to have their leaders sign the anti-communist oaths or risk expulsion.Loftus, \\"CIO Tells Leftists to Obey or Resign,\\" New York Times, May 20, 1949. At its annual convention in early November 1949, the CIO found the ACA \\"guilty\\" of not filing the required oaths and ordered it expelled.Stark, \\"C.I.O. Starts Purge of Leftist Officers,\\" New York Times, November 5, 1949; Stark, \\"Ouster of Leftists Is Pressed By C.I.O.,\\" New York Times, November 6, 1949. Expulsion occurred in June 1950.\\"Two More Unions Expelled by C.I.O.,\\" New York Times, June 16, 1950. But lacking the protection of the NLRA and constantly fending off raids from affiliates of the CIO and the American Federation of Labor (affiliates whose leaders were eager to sign the oath), the ACA shrank rapidly.Estey, The Unions: Structure, Development, and Management, 1981, p. 34. Several of its divisions (including the old ARTA department) had disaffiliated and the union shrank to fewer than 2,000 members. It merged with the Teamsters in 1966. American Communications Association v. Douds was the first important test of loyalty oaths in the U.S. Supreme Court.Walker, In Defense of American Liberties: A History of the ACLU, 1999, p. 189. A year later, the Court relied heavily on Douds' oath-as- predictor-of-future-action rationale in upholding a local government loyalty test in Garner v. Board of Public Works, 341 U.S. 716 (1951). The divided court in Douds anticipated the difficulty the Supreme Court would have in the coming years, during which time it usually upheld loyalty oaths but found no clear test or rule for doing so. The case was also the first time the Court applied a balancing test to indirect restrictions on free speech, a test the Court would consistently apply in many similar cases in the future.Becker, \\"The Supreme Court's Recent 'National Security' Decisions: Which Interests are Being Protected?\\", Tennessee Law Review, Fall 1972, p. 15-16; Kearney, \\"Private Citizens in Foreign Affairs: A Constitutional Analysis,\\" Emory Law Journal, Winter 1987, p. 329. But the balancing test itself has been criticized as offering little guidance to future courts, not enough protection to First Amendment rights, and too much deference to the legislature.Cohen, \\"The Scope of First Amendment Protection for Political Boycotts: Means and Ends in First Amendment Analysis: NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co.,\\" Wisconsin Law Review, July/August 1984, p. 1285; Nimmer, \\"The Right to Speak from Times to Time: First Amendment Theory Applied to Libel and Misapplied to Privacy,\\" California Law Review, 1968, p. 939-941; Emerson, The System of Freedom of Expression, 1970, p. 54-55. The reasoning by the majority in American Communications Association v. Douds has not been well-received by legal scholars. One historian characterized the decision as combining \\"guilt by association\\" with the discredited \\"bad tendency test\\". One legal scholar has called Vinson's heavy reliance on the Commerce Clause as \\"implausible\\". Douds also seems to have got some facts wrong: The political strikes Vinson relied on for examples in the case were not Communist-led but rather routine labor conflicts.Wiecek, History of the Supreme Court of the United States..., 2006, p. 548. The majority (unwittingly or not) believed in a distinctly American myth about a monolithic Communist Party controlled from overseas, endowed with the ability to deceive American workers, and capable of bringing the nation to its knees through the use of political strikes.Wiecek, \\"The Legal Foundations of Domestic Anticommunism: The Background of Dennis v. United States,\\" Supreme Court Review, 2001, 378; Auerbach, \\"The Communist Control Act of 1954: A Proposed Legal-Political Theory of Free Speech,\\" University of Chicago Law Review, 1956, p. 23; Bork, \\"Neutral Principles and Some First Amendment Problems,\\" Indiana Law Journal, 1971, p. 29-35. Vinson's balancing test had a decidedly pro-government bias, and the decision appeared to undermine a decade's worth of First Amendment decisions.Wiecek, History of the Supreme Court of the United States..., 2006, p. 548-549. Vinson's claim that the Taft- Hartley Act did not proscribe belief has been called \\"sophistry.\\"Wiecek, History of the Supreme Court of the United States..., 2006, p. 549. And the majority's claimThis is the majority's famous claim: \\"...while this court sits.\\" See: American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 410. that any flaws in its approach can be easily rectified by appealing to the Supreme Court was not only scoffed at by Justice Black but has also been sharply criticized by legal scholars.Nagel, \\"How Useful Is Judicial Review In Free Speech Cases?\\", Cornell Law Review, January 1984, p. 335-336. (To be fair, some legal scholars disagree, and believe the Court has done an excellent job of protecting First Amendment rights.)Schiller, \\"Free Speech and Expertise: Administrative Censorship and the Birth of the Modern First Amendment,\\" Virginia Law Review, February 2000, p. 74. Douds has also been criticized for undermining the First Amendment right to freedom of association. This right was also enshrined in the First Amendment. In 1945, the Court had declared in Thomas v. Collins, 323 U.S. 516 (1945) that freedom of association held a \\"preferred place\\"Thomas v. Collins, 323 U.S. 516, 530. in the pantheon of constitutional values.Inazu, \\"The Strange Origins of the Constitutional Right of Association,\\" Tennessee Law Review, Spring 2010, p. 495. Three years later, in United States v. Congress of Industrial Organizations, 335 U.S. 106 (1948) Justice Rutledge had concluded that, when confronted with the freedom of association, \\"[Legislative] judgment does not bear the same weight and is not entitled to the same presumption of validity, when the legislation on its face or in specific application restricts the rights of conscience, expression and assembly protected by the Amendment...\\"United States v. Congress of Industrial Organizations, 335 U.S. 106, 140. Yet, in Douds, the Court announced it was going to show great deference to legislative determinations regarding the danger communists posed. Nonetheless, American Communications Association v. Douds should not be seen as an anomalous decision in the Supreme Court's First Amendment jurisprudence. One noted legal historian has observed that it is but one of many \\"bad tendency test\\" cases in a series of decisions between 1919 and 1956.Wiecek, \\"The Legal Foundations of Domestic Anticommunism: The Background of Dennis v. United States,\\" Supreme Court Review, 2001, 376-377. American Communications Association v. Douds is also important because it is part of the Court's evolving jurisprudence on bills of attainder.\\"Beyond Process: A Substantive Rationale for the Bill of Attainder Clause,\\" Virginia Law Review, April 1984, p. 476-487. It stands firmly in the Court's bill of attainder jurisprudence established by Justice Frankfurter in his dissent in United States v. Lovett, 328 U.S. 303 (1946), thereafter adopted by a majority of the Court.\\"Beyond Process: A Substantive Rationale for the Bill of Attainder Clause,\\" Virginia Law Review, April 1984, p. 484. Frankfurter and a majority of the Court believed that the framers of the Constitution were not concerned as much with unfairness as they were with specification of the offense, the legislative (rather than judicial) determination of guilt, and retribution for past acts. Douds stands firmly in this analysis, which found favor with the Court until 1965.\\"Beyond Process: A Substantive Rationale for the Bill of Attainder Clause,\\" Virginia Law Review, April 1984, p. 485. It is no surprise, then, that the Supreme Court refused to declare Section 9(h) a bill of attainder, because it prohibited future rather than past acts.Welsh, \\"The Bill of Attainder Clause: An Unqualified Guarantee of Process,\\" Brooklyn Law Review, Fall 1983, p. 97. The ability to \\"escape\\" the penalty (e.g., renounce membership in the Communist Party and take the oath) also negated any conclusion that Section 9(h) was a bill of attainder.Carringan, \\"The Bill of Attainder Clause: A New Weapon to Challenge the Oil Pollution Act of 1990,\\" Boston College Environmental Affairs Law Review, 2000, p. 143. In 1965, however, the Supreme Court held, 5-to-4, that Section 504 of the Taft-Hartley Act was a bill of attainder in United States v. Brown, 381 U.S. 437 (1965). Section 504 made it an actual crime for any person who was or had been a member of the Communist Party to serve as an officer in a labor union. The Court overturned Section 504 because past behavior was being punished. But the Court went further, and said that singling out members of the Communist Party for punishment also invalidated Section 504 as a bill of attainder. How could the Court reconcile this with its analysis in Douds, where it had not held such specificity to invalidate the law? The Brown Court said that general legislation which required regulatory rulemaking did not specify individuals well enough to make the law a bill of attainder.Welsh, \\"The Bill of Attainder Clause: An Unqualified Guarantee of Process,\\" Brooklyn Law Review, Fall 1983, p. 98. That regulatory action was needed under Section 9(h) but not under Section 504 saved Section 9(h). The Court implied that its Equal Protection analysis would be applied in cases where punishment was meted out under regulatory procedures, and that due process and equal protection would guarantee rights in these situations.Welsh, \\"The Bill of Attainder Clause: An Unqualified Guarantee of Process,\\" Brooklyn Law Review, Fall 1983, p. 99. Douds was difficult to reconcile with Brown in another way, too. Douds had focused heavily on the fact that the Taft-Hartley Act's restrictions were intended to prevent future, not past, actions. This was critical to saving Section 9(h). But in Brown, the Court held that \\"Punishment serves several purposes; retributive, rehabilitative, deterrent‚Äîand preventive\\", establishing that a law can be a bill of attainder even it is preventive.Carringan, \\"The Bill of Attainder Clause: A New Weapon to Challenge the Oil Pollution Act of 1990,\\" Boston College Environmental Affairs Law Review, 2000, p. 143, quoting United States v. Brown, 381 U.S. 437, at 458. It is not clear whether Douds remains good case law. The Supreme Court distinguished the case but declined to overrule Douds in Dennis v. United States, 341 U.S. 494 (1951).Emerson, Haber, and Dorsen, Political and Civil Rights in the United States, 1967, p. 62. In 1965, in United States v. Brown, 381 U.S. 437 (1965), the Supreme Court essentially overturned Douds by holding that the Taft-Hartley Act's oath constituted a bill of attainder, but did not formally do so.Rabinowitz, Unrepentant Leftist: A Lawyer's Memoir, 1996, p. 56. Two years later, in United States v. Robel, 389 U.S. 258 (1967), the Court specifically declined to apply a balancing test to a law prohibiting members of the Communist Party from holding jobs in the defense industry.Kearney, \\"Private Citizens in Foreign Affairs: A Constitutional Analysis,\\" Emory Law Journal, Winter 1987, p. 330. Although the law was based on the same rationale as Taft-Hartley (that membership in the Communist Party was a sure indication of future action), the Supreme Court said this was too heavy an infringement on the individual's First Amendment rights. Instead, the Court seemed to suggest a new, two-part test: Whether the governmental interests advanced are valid, and whether the statute is narrowly drawn to infringe on First Amendment rights in the most narrow way. The Court returned to the balancing test in Brandenberg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444 (1969), but this time concluded that prohibiting mere advocacy of violence was too heavy a burden on the First Amendment. Such advocacy must produce imminent action for the speech to be punishable, the Court held.Kearney, \\"Private Citizens in Foreign Affairs: A Constitutional Analysis,\\" Emory Law Journal, Winter 1987, p. 327.

A native of Jakarta, Indonesia, he now resides in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. He is mostly known as a former guitarist, vocalist, and record producer for the avant-garde/progressive metal band Kekal. Professionally, he has made a career as a graphic designer and has worked at various companies for more than a decade. In the past, he was also known in the music scene for his works as a freelance graphic designer under Soundmind Graphics, and until his 2006 move to Canada, Jeff owned and ran his own home-based recording studio, Vision Studio, in Jakarta. He also was a staff member of the record label THT Productions. In addition to his roles in Kekal, he was also the co-founder of progressive metal project Altera Enigma and was involved with bands such as Armageddon Holocaust and Inner Warfare. History Jeff was born in Jakarta, Indonesia's capital city and largest municipality. Since his early childhood, he has shown interests in art and music in general. Spending most of his upbringing in a global city, Jeff had an early exposure in the diversity of culture, religion and ethnicity, which helped to form his views of seeing the music and art in a liberal way. He once tried to become a painter but later found out that music suits him better, as he explained on the 2007 interview with Ultimate Metal webzine: \\"I cannot express with other media such as painting or poetry. My father is a painter and he expresses himself through this. I once tried it, but it didn‚Äôt work for me ‚Äì I can make technically proficient sketches and illustrations, but felt distant from them. It‚Äôs like a cold relationship. So when I found music and started to write songs, it just came up to me and I said to myself 'that's it, this is the most suitable medium for me'. But for right now, I don't rely on music as my career, I work another job to pay the bills.\\" In 2000, Jeff graduated from Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia with a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, and according to another interview with Ultimate Metal, he taught himself graphic design through books and internet. In 2006 Jeff moved to Canada and eventually became a permanent resident. He was living in Toronto while taking a study in audio engineering, and later on relocated to Calgary and settled there. Music Jeff started playing guitar back in 1989 when he was 15 years old. In 1990, with his high-school friends, he formed his own band, Obliteration, in which he at first played bass but then switched to drums. The project was precursor to the later band Kekal, and played a primitive style of punk and thrash metal. Jeff decided to quit this band in 1991 to spend more time learning the guitar. In 1992 he bought his first electric guitar and joined a band called Sonic Warfare (which later changed its name to Inner Warfare) as a guitarist and vocalist. According to Jeff, this was his first serious band, and Inner Warfare wrote its own music, played shows, and recorded some demos before disbanding in 1997. =Kekal= Jeff has been involved in Kekal as a guitarist, vocalist, songwriter and record producer since the band's inception in 1995, and he was listed as an official member of the band from 1996 until 2009. Kekal started out as an extreme metal band, and gradually progressed into more electronic-influenced experimental and avant-garde metal. The band has met with critical acclaim, and has released eight full-length albums so far. Kekal is considered as the first metal band from Indonesia to make international inroads by releasing albums through record labels in Europe and North America, and being the first band from Indonesia to tour Europe in 2004. In 2006, Jeff Arwadi moved to Canada while the rest of the members remained in Indonesia, which left the band unable to play shows and do touring. At the same time the band left their longtime record label Fear Dark and status of the band was in question. After few months of uncertainty and rumors of break-up went around among fans, Kekal decided to remain together and to keep the band only as a studio project. They signed licensing deals to two new record labels in Europe and North America and released The Habit of Fire a year after, which met with international success and critical acclaim. In August 2009, Jeff announced that he and all other members of Kekal had left the band, but it was decided that the name would continue without active band members. Jeff stated that, in addition to unspecified personal reasons, he decided to leave the band because, after being closer to nature and in a less densely populated city in Canada, he was unable to continue to make dark and angry metal music which he did in the past with Kekal. Many of their fans perceived that Kekal had technically split- up/disbanded at the moment band leader Jeff announced his departure from the band, despite the fact that Kekal as an institution still existed and the institution itself was not affected by any founding member leaving. To end the confusions among their fans, the band issued a statement posted on their official Facebook page that clarified the status of the band. Despite him leaving Kekal, Jeff still contributes to the band as a songwriter, performer and recording producer, which released its eight studio album 8 in December 2010, and ninth studio album Autonomy in December 2012. =Altera Enigma= Altera Enigma was formed in 2004 when Jeff Arwadi teamed up with Australian guitarist Jason DeRon, formerly of Paramaecium. The band was created as an outlet for the two musicians to work together on music that would push their boundaries, challenge them musically and allow them to broaden their horizons and explore progressive music in all its forms. Altera Enigma released its debut album, Alteration, in 2006. As of March 2010, Jeff decided that he needed to step away from Altera Enigma, and his contribution to the project is now minimal, although according to Jason DeRon the band will continue to take advantage of his creativity and inventiveness. =Armageddon Holocaust= Jeff was also involved with Armageddon Holocaust as Meister J. Armageddon Holocaust originally formed as a one-time project by two founders under pseudonyms Doctor Dark and Dark Thriller. Jeff provided drum programming on the project's debut album Into Total Destruction as well as his audio engineering and production talents as a producer and mixing engineer for all three Armageddon Holocaust albums. When the project was restarted in 2002, Jeff took the place of former member Dark Thriller and he used Meister J as a stage name. He remained for the next two albums, Radioactive Zone 245 and Nekrofonik, after which the project disbanded again in 2004. =Other projects= In addition to Kekal, Altera Engima, and Armageddon Holocaust, Jeff has been involved in other bands and projects including Doctor D and Excision. Graphic Design and Audio Production Despite Jeff's formal educational background in Psychology, he currently works professionally as a graphic designer specializing in print, web and multimedia production. On his LinkedIn profile he describes his diverse skills and experience in the creative fields which include audio engineering, music production and video post-production. Besides the bands and studio projects he has involved in, he also helped other independent bands to produce their albums and demos. At one time, Jeff worked for an independent record label THT Productions, and was in charge of all recording production and graphic design. In 2006 he enrolled himself in an audio engineering college in Toronto, Ontario, Canada where he met his teacher/mentor Darryl Neudorf; former member of the band 54-40 and record producer of high-profile Canadian artists such as Sarah McLachlan, The New Pornographers and Blue Rodeo. Under production inputs from Darryl, Jeff produced and recorded many of the songs released as Kekal's album Audible Minority in the college's studio facilities while he learned industry standard DAW programs such as ProTools and Logic Pro. =Soundmind Graphics= Jeff founded Soundmind Graphics in the year 2000. It was a freelance graphic design service that provided computer- based graphics for web sites, multimedia, and print media for music related industries. In 2011, on Kekal Facebook page he stated that he no longer offers services as Soundmind Graphics. =Vision Studio= In 2001 Jeff built his own home studio which he named it Vision Studio. It occupied one of the rooms in his house in Jakarta, and was basically a simple computer-based DAW setup that Jeff mentioned its main purpose as \\"enough for recording music without disturbing the neighbours, so I could spend the night recording music\\". At Vision Studio, Jeff produced, engineered and mixed many album and demo projects from various bands, including three Kekal albums and all Armageddon Holocaust albums. In 2006, upon moving to Canada, Jeff sold his house including the studio facility. Personal life Jeff has stated in several interviews that he is a Christian, but he does not consider himself religious and does not consider his belief in Christianity to be a religion, as it is more about faith. In another interview, Jeff stated: \\"For me personally, faith is something that drives you to live the life as a human being... I happen to believe in something good, that's why I am always looking for better life and try to improve health, for example. But it does not have to be associated with religion whatsoever. You don't have to be religious to ever believe that there is light at the end of the tunnel, and you don't have to be religious to have a good diet and workout some exercise.\\" Jeff is married and he shares with his wife the hobbies of watching movies, hiking and outdoor photography. Jeff is also known as a big fan of Honda and often cites Soichiro Honda as an inspiration. Although at the time of the interview, he did not consider himself as an automobile enthusiast, he showed his passion in automotive design and is a proponent of hydrogen fuel cell vehicle as the ideal solution for future mobility to replace world's dependency on fossil fuel.

Like the program, the comic strip was written to be humorous to both kids and adults. The strip ran from April 5, 1998 to May 3, 2003. Writers for the series were Scott Gray, Gordon Kent, Lee Nordling, Chuck Kim, Scott Roberts, J. Torres, Mark Bilgrey, John Zakour, and Rob Moran. The original artist was Steve Crespo, pencils and inks. Crespo left early on, and Will Blyberg took over inking, while other pencilers included: Gary Fields, Kyle Baker, (who did his own inking) a South American known only as \\"Rodrigues\\", Tim Harkins, Vince Giarrano, and Scott Roberts (the only contributor to both write and draw the strip.) By the end, Roberts was the sole penciler, and Blyberg inked till the final strip. Sundays were colored by Stu Chaifitz. Tim Harkins and Gary Fields lettered even after they stopped penciling. Early strips had no continuity, but later years featured short storylines. Public reaction to the series was muted, compared to the television series. Washington Post readers of all age brackets, for example, voted Rugrats as its worst comic strip. Many newspapers quickly demoted the title to Sunday-only. In all, 130 newspapers carried the comic strip at some point during its run, in the United States, Australia, Brazil, and Canada. Newspapers in Orlando (home of Nickelodeon Studios) never picked up the title, while Rugrats was dropped early from New York and Los Angeles papers, home of the Viacom and Klasky-Csupo headquarters, respectively. Scott Gray and Tim Harkins created two special strips for Mott's Flavored Applesauce, single- serving. Relation to the animation Occasional comic strips conflict with the continuity of the television series, reintroducing characters in different scenarios, but some take plotlines from episodes. For the weeks of November 26 to December 9, 2000, the strips were themed to the feature film Rugrats in Paris: The Movie. The assumption is that the readers have seen the feature film, not fully dealing with the major plot points of the movie. In the November 30 strip, Kimi first appears in the comic strip, without any introduction to the character. The first week after the series is about Chuckie being excited that he has a new sister.

The community was founded by Amelia Vancil and Chauncey Warren Moffet in February 1857 (the town was named after them but, at some point, misspelled). A store, built by William Elisha Pruett in the late 1860s, served as main social focus for area residents for several years. The community has been referred to by several names: Moffattown, Moffatsville, Mount Green, and Gandertown; Moffat was chosen as the official name when a post office opened there in 1872. By the mid-1880s Moffat had a district school and three churches as well as a steam gristmill and cotton gin and a variety of other businesses to serve its 200 residents.Bell County Historical Commission, Story of Bell County, Texas (2 vols., Austin: Eakin Press, 1988).

The Moffat community reached a peak population in 1890, when it reported 350 residents. By 1900 its population had fallen to 147. The post office at Moffat was discontinued in 1918, and mail for the community was sent to Bland; the office opened again from February 1925 to December 1926, after which local mail was sent to Belton. From the late 1940s through the mid-1980s the population of Moffat was reported at seventy-five to 100 residents.

Arna owns and operates a studio called Dancingmonkeys with her husband/partner John van Bruggen.  Career  Selznick completed two years, 2014- 2016 as a key member of the story team of the CG animated feature film, The Nut Job 2, produced in Toronto by Toonbox Entertainment. She is currently directing a CG animated featurette for Corus's Nelvana, titled The Most Magnificent Thing, based on the popular children's book by Ashley Spires. Selznick began her career at Toronto's Nelvana studio, participating in several efforts such as layout artist on Rock & Rule, story supervisor on Inspector Gadget and director on Strawberry Shortcake and the Baby Without a Name. There, she met future husband John van Bruggen. She moved on to direct The Care Bears Movie, released in 1985 by the Samuel Goldwyn Company in the United States, and Astral Films and Criterion Pictures Corporation in Canada. The film won Canada's Golden Reel Award for highest- grossing local production in 1985, with the Canadian gross of $22,934,622.00. Quite remarkable, since children's admission at the time was about $3.50 or less. At the time of that film's release, Arna was probably only the third woman to direct an animated feature (after Lotte Reiniger of 1927's The Adventures of Prince Achmed, and Joy Batchelor of 1954's Animal Farm). Selznick was part of the layout unit on the next two Care Bears films, A New Generation (1986) and Adventure in Wonderland (1987), and was also a story artist on Wonderland. In 1986, Selznick launched the dancingmonkeys studio in Toronto, partnering with director/screen writer John van Bruggen. In 2005, she and van Bruggen created Coolman!, part of the FunPak series on Canada's YTV network. Selznick has been on story teams for several other children's films and television series, among them Nelvana's Cone High; Disney's Return to Never Land; the British animated feature The King's Beard; the Nicktoons sci- fi saga Skyland; Treehouse TV's Toot & Puddle; and many other Nelvana productions. While the Houston Chronicle's Stephen Hunter gave a mixed response to the animation of The Care Bears Movie, he pointed out that director Selznick \\"has a nice feel for the dynamics of action animation; several of the set-pieces zing along nicely.\\"  Notes   References  External links *Official site * Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Artists from Toronto Category:Living people Category:Canadian animators Category:Canadian storyboard artists Category:Canadian women film directors Category:Canadian screenwriters Category:Canadian animated film directors Category:Film directors from Toronto Category:Women animators Category:Writers from Toronto ","title":"Arna Selznick"},{"id":"29589540","text":"The Arnold and Marie Schwartz College of Pharmacy, formerly known as the Brooklyn College of Pharmacy, is a graduate school of Long Island University (LIU)'s Brooklyn Campus.

Including people directly employed in brewing, as well as those who supply Indiana's breweries with everything from ingredients to machinery, the total business and personal tax revenue generated by Indiana's breweries and related industries was more than $456 million. Consumer purchases of Indiana's brewery products generated almost $192 million extra in tax revenue. In 2012, according to the Brewers Association, Indiana ranked 22nd in the number of craft breweries per capita, with 54. For context, at the end of 2013 there were 2,822 breweries in the United States, including 2,768 craft breweries subdivided into 1,237 brewpubs, 1,412 microbreweries and 119 regional craft breweries.

He is noted for his role in saving a group of political prisoners at the end of the war. Most German bomb disposal during World War II was carried out by the Luftwaffe. Feuerwerker or armourers were given specific and extensive training in bomb disposal, although by the late-war period this was replaced by experience and examination alone, as for the British system. A bomb disposal section or Sprengkommando was led by an officer or Oberfeuerwerker (Senior NCO) with three or four Feuerwerker. Simple labouring, such as excavation for buried bombs, was carried out by prisoners: either criminals or political prisoners, but not prisoners of war. Citizens of occupied countries were also used, within those countries. These prisoner labourers were in turn guarded by Luftwaffe guards. Relations between Luftwaffe members and prisoners appear to have been cordial, for the political prisoners at least, if not the criminals. In May 1943 Schweizer recovered an unexploded bouncing bomb from a Lancaster, 'E Easy', that crashed on its way to the target during Operation Chastise, the Dambuster raid. On 28 June 1943 he was awarded his Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes (Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross) as Hauptmann (W) and leader of Sprengkommando 1/IV Ratingen-D√ºsseldorf. In 1945, Hauptmann Schweizer learned that the SS were about to execute a number of political prisoners. Together with his junior assistant, army officer Oberleutnant Werdelmann, he went to their camp. Claiming that a number of unexploded bombs required an immediate large team of labourers, he had the threatened prisoners released to his own custody. He took them to his headquarters at Kalkum in the Ruhr until they could be released to the advancing American Army. Schweizer was murdered on 5 June 1946 in Klobbicke/Biesenthal by a drunken Soviet soldier. Notes  References  ;Bibliography  Thamm, August (2004).

GBS was the operator behind GTV, a popular, if niche Direct to Home (DTH) satellite Pay-TV service present in 22 African markets.

In 2010, ZAP launched in Angola, providing digital satellite television mainly for Portuguese speaking countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Satellite television has been far more successful in Africa than cable, primarily because the infrastructure for cable television does not exist and would be expensive to install since majority of Africans cannot afford paid cable television. Furthermore, maintaining a cable network is expensive due to the need to cover larger and more sparsely populated areas though there are some terrestrial pay-TV and MMDS services. =Nigeria= Traditionally DStv had held a large market share in Nigeria's Satellite television sector but several companies, HiTV, MyTV, Trend TV, ACTV, Consat, Daarsat, Metrodigital, Montage cable network and StarTimes also compete in this sector. =Sudan= Sudan TV, the government-owned national network, is available by satellite as well as broadcast.BBC News: Country profile: Sudan. 18 June 2008.

In October 2004, Quebec Judge Dani√®le C√¥t√© ruled Canada's Radiocommunication Act to be in direct violation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, in so far as it bans reception of unlicensed foreign television services. The judgment gave the federal government a one-year deadline to remedy this breach of the Constitution. However, this contradicts prior Supreme Court of Canada decisions and was overturned on appeal.R. v. D'Argy, 2005 CanLII 8977 (QC C.S.) and D'Argy c. R., 2006 QCCA 1249 (CanLII) A Supreme Court of Canada decision in the case of Bell ExpressVu v. Richard Rex, made on April 26, 2002, confirms that provisions in the Radiocommunication Act forbid the illegal decoding of satellite television programming.http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt- gst.nsf/eng/h_sf05562.html Although there are no official statistics, the use of American satellite services in Canada appears to be declining as of 2004. Some would claim that this is probably due to a combination of increasingly aggressive police enforcement and an unfavourable exchange rate between the Canadian and U.S. currencies. As the U.S. dollar has been declining as of 2005 versus other international currencies, the decline in DirecTV viewership in Canada may well be related not to a cost difference as much as to the series of smart card swaps which have rendered the first three generations of DirecTV access cards (F, H and HU) all obsolete. Bell underwent a period of phasing out satellite receivers in urban areas, replacing it with IPTV transmitted over regular telephone lines. =Hispanic America= Hispanic America's main satellite systems are SKY M√©xico with 3 million subscribers and Dish M√©xico with 2.2 million subscribersDish Mexico wants to triple its subscribers by the end of 2012 and Vrio, which provides service to the rest of the Americas, with a total of approximately 1.3 million subscribers. =Chile= There are several satellite providers in Chile. The main ones are listed below: # DirecTV # Movistar TV # Claro TV # TuVes HD # Entel (Chile) =Brazil= There are about 10 million subscribers of satellite TV in Brazil;http://www.abta.org.br/dados_do_setor.asp the main satellite system is SKY Brasil with approximately 1.4 million subscribers; other satellite TV operators are Vivo TV, Claro TV and Oi TV. A major problem are pirate receivers (usually using card sharing systems to cheat the conditional access systems) which amount to an unknown quantity of users. The service offered in Brazil includes Digital TV with full Dolby Digital surround support, mts and multiple subtitle options, a first for the Brazilian market. A recent update to Sky's services in Brazil is Sky+ which allows the customer to record a program while watching another one and also Sky HD which currently provides up to 29 high definition channels. Services are however relatively expensive, therefore market penetration is still limited. Asia = Bangladesh = There are several satellite providers in Bangladesh. The main ones are listed below: # ASIAN TV # Bangla Vision # NTV # RTV # ATN Bangla # Channel I # ETV # Desh TV =Kazakhstan= The first satellite TV channel in Kazakhstan, CaspioNet, was launched by the Khabar news agency in 2002. =Malaysia= Astro's \\"mini-dish\\". Malaysia's sole satellite television operator, Measat Broadcast Network Systems (a subsidiary of Astro All Asia Networks plc) launched Astro in 1996. It currently holds exclusive rights from the Malaysian government to offer satellite television broadcasting services in the country through the year 2017. =Mongolia= The Naran station (aka Orbit Station) is first satellite television in Mongolia. In 1991, Naran Station broadcast one channel, which is MNB. In 2005, Naran station extended the channel list up to 4 FTA channels. In 2010 they stopped television broadcast. Government has decided to allow private company does the service in 2008. DDishTV broadcast 18 channels, including 15 local channels and 3 foreign channels since 2008. DDishTV LLC is the satellite television operator in Mongolia. =Japan= The medium-scale Broadcasting Satellite for Experimental Purposes (BSE) was planned by Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MOPT) and developed by the National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) since 1974. After that, the first Japanese experimental broadcasting satellite, called BSE or Yuri, was launched in 1978. NHK started experimental broadcasting of TV program using BS-2a satellite on May, 1984. The satellite BS-2a was launched in preparation for the start of full scale 2-channel broadcasts. Broadcasting Satellite BS-2a was the first national DBS (direct broadcasting satellite), transmitting signals directly into the home of TV viewers. Attitude control of the satellite was conducted using the 3 axial method (zero momentum), and design life was 5 years. The TV transponder units are designed to sufficiently amplify transmitted signals to enable reception by small, 40 or 60 cm home-use parabolic antennas. The satellite was equipped with 3 TV transponders (including reserve units). However, one transponder malfunctioned 2 months after launch (March 23, 1984) and a second transponder malfunctioned 3 months after launch (May 3, 1984). So, the scheduled satellite broadcasting had to be hastily adjusted to test broadcasting on a single channel. Later, NHK started regular service (NTSC) and experimental HDTV broadcasting using BS-2b on June, 1989. Some Japanese producers of home electronic consumer devices began to deliver TVsets, VCRs and even home acoustic systems equipped by built-in satellite tuners or receivers. Such electronic goods had a specific BS logo. On April, 1991, Japanese company JSB started pay TV service while BS-3 communication satellite was in use. In 1996 total number of households that receive satellite broadcasting exceeded 10 million. The modern two satellite systems in use in Japan are BSAT and JCSAT; the modern WOWOW Broadcasting Satellite digital service uses BSAT satellites, while other system of digital TV broadcasting SKY PerfecTV! uses JCSAT satellites. =India= Over 1340 TV Satellite channels are broadcast in India. This includes channels from the state-owned Doordarshan, News Corporation owned STAR TV, Sony owned Sony Entertainment Television, Sun Network and Zee TV. Major satellite television providers in India are DD Direct Plus, Dish TV, Airtel digital TV, Reliance Digital TV, Videocon d2h, Sun Direct and Tata Sky. Most of them have already started their premium HDTV services. These services are provided by locally built satellites from ISRO such as [15] INSAT 4CR, INSAT 4A, INSAT-2E, INSAT-3C and INSAT-3E as well as private satellites such as the Dutch-based SES, Global-owned NSS 6, Thaicom-2 and Telstar 10. =Pakistan= In the recent years, there has been a lot of investment in television industry in Pakistan. There are more than 34 Satellite channels operating directly inside Pakistan and about 10 operating their broadcasting from Dubai, Thailand, Bangkok and UK. =Philippines= Satellite TV in the Philippines began in 2001 when the first pay DTH service Dream Satellite TV was launched. In 2009, both Cignal and G Sat were launched on the NSS 11 broadcasting satellite. Later, these satellite TV providers began offering HD. However, G Sat HD has different channels than Cignal HD. Later in 2012, Cignal began to move their programming to SES-7 for similar coverage. These are the main satellite TV providers in the Philippines: *Dream Satellite TV is a pay DTH service of Philippine Multimedia Service Inc. (PMSI) *Cignal is a pay DTH service of Mediascape Inc. *G Sat is a pay DTH service of FUBC. *Sky Direct is a pay DTH service of Sky. =Sri Lanka= Satellite TV in Sri Lanka began in 2005 as CBNsat. However, it was later acquired by the island's mobile GSM Operator, Dialog and was relaunched as Dialog TV. In 2015 Dish TV India started their operations in Sri Lanka in a joint venture with Satnet (Pvt) Ltd, as Dish TV Lanka which is now the 2nd largest DTH Operator in the island. =Thailand= TrueVisions is the leading pay TV service of Thailand which operate cable TV in Bangkok and satellite TV across the country. TrueVisions is owned by True Corporation. VIet Nam sat is just launched in 4/2008 and GMM Grammy is the second pay TV service of Thailand. Oceania =Australia= Satellite television in Australia has proven to be a far more feasible option than cable television, due to the vast distances between population centres. The first service to come online in Australia was Galaxy, which was later taken over by Cable Television giant Foxtel, which now operates both cable and satellite services to all state capital cities (except Darwin and Hobart) and the whole of Western Australia. Its main metropolitan rival was Optus Vision, while rural areas are served by Austar, both of which just rebroadcast Foxtel as of 2005. In 2006 SelecTV began operating, aiming at providing comparatively low cost packages and catering to specialised market segments. In 2010, SelecTV ceased operation and handed over all of their English-language content customers to Foxtel. = New Zealand = In New Zealand, SKY Network Television offers multichannel digital satellite TV, and once offered non- digital terrestrial UHF service which was shut down progressively during the first half of 2010. The newly released Freeview service is also available on the Optus D1 satellite, as well as a High Definition digital terrestrial service. Europe =Continental Western Europe= Artistic parabolic antenna in Taormina, Sicily. In Europe, DBS satellite services are found mainly on SES Astra satellites and Hotbird (operated by Eutelsat.) BSkyB (known as Sky) serves the UK. SKY Italia, Canal Digitaal and UPC being the main providers in Italy, the Netherlands and Central Europe. CanalSat, owned by France's Canal+ and Vivendi. Sky Deutschland in Germany. The overall market share of DBS satellite services in 2004 was 21.4% of all TV homes, however this highly varies from country to country. For example, in Germany, with many free-to-air TV-stations, DBS market share is almost 40%, and in Belgium and the Netherlands, it's only about 7%, due to the widespread cable networks with exclusive content. From about Lyon south through France and all of Spain Portugal and Morocco there are many English Language TV channels on Arabsat and Nilesat. These include BBC News, MBC, Fox Movies, many sport channels from the Near East and Egypt. A 90 cm dish is enough but twist the LNB slightly clockwise as you go south. Try first Arabsat 26 degrees east, a bit higher that Astra 2. 11919 H should get you MBC Action. Nilesat is a bit to the right and has mostly the same channels. =Spain= Spain's company Hispasat operates satellites for free channels and several payment platforms. However, the most common operator Movistar+, broadcast via Astra and lately push their clients to use their own fiber internet network, if it's available. =United Kingdom and Ireland= Sky UK \\"mini-dish\\" The first commercial DBS service in the United Kingdom, Sky Television, was launched in 1989 and used the newly launched SES Astra 1A satellite, providing 4 analogue TV channels. The channels and subsequent VideoCrypt video encryption system used the existing PAL broadcast standard. This gave Sky a distinct advantage over the winner of the UK state DBS licence, BSB. In the following year, after many delays, BSB was launched, broadcasting five channels (Now, Galaxy, The Movie Channel, The Power Station and The Sports Channel) in D-MAC format and using the EuroCypher video encryption system which was based heavily on the General Instruments VideoCipher system used in the USA. While the BSB's broadcast standard and system was technologically more advanced than the PAL based Sky system and one of the main selling points of the BSB offering was the Squarial, an expensive flat plate antenna and LNB. Sky's system used conventional cheap dish and LNB technology. The BSB system used an integrated receiver / decoder whereas the Sky system had standalone decoders and integrated receiver decoders. This allowed Sky to market directly to an audience that already had satellite TV systems. The competition between the two companies was fierce and bidding wars over the UK rights to movies. Sky kept costs to a bare minimum, operating from an industrial park in Isleworth in West London. BSB had expensive offices in London (Marco Polo House). The two services subsequently merged to form British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB) though the new BSkyB was really Sky. The technologically more advanced BSB D-MAC/EuroCypher system was gradually replaced with Sky's VideoCrypt video encryption system. In 1994 17% of the group was floated on the London Stock Exchange (with ADRs listed on the New York Stock Exchange), and Rupert Murdoch‚Äôs News Corporation owns a 35% stake. By 1999, following the launch of several more satellites (at 19.2¬∞E by SES), the number of channels had increased to around 60 and BSkyB launched the first subscription-based digital television platform in the UK, offering a range of 300 channels broadcast from the SES Astra satellites at 28.2¬∞E under the brand name Sky Digital. BSkyB‚Äôs analogue service was discontinued on 31 December 2001 and all customers have migrated to Sky Digital. In May 2008, a free-to- air satellite service from the BBC and ITV was launched under the brand name Freesat, carrying a variety of channels, including some content in HD formats. Comcast, the largest cable TV provider in the USA, outbid 21st Century Fox and its backer, Disney, on September 22, 2018 in an auction for control of Sky UK. Its shareholders have until October 11, 2018 to accept or reject the offer. =Russian Federation= The first Soviet communication satellite, called Molniya (–ú–æ–ª–Ω–∏—è, or \\"Lightning\\"), was launched in 1965. By November 1967, the national system of satellite television, called Orbita, was deployed. The system consisted of three highly elliptical Molniya satellites, Moscow-based ground uplink facilities and about 20 downlink stations, located in cities and towns of remote regions of Siberia and the Far East. Each station had a 12-meter receiving parabolic antenna and transmitters for re-broadcasting TV signal to local householders. However, a large part of Soviet central regions were still not covered by transponders of Molniya satellites. By 1976, Soviet engineers developed a relatively simple and inexpensive system of satellite television (especially for Central and Northern Siberia). It included geostationary satellites called Ekran equipped with powerful 300 W UHF transponders, a broadcasting uplink station and various simple receiving stations located in various towns and villages of Siberian region. The typical receiving station, also called Ekran, represented itself as a home-use analog satellite receiver equipped with simple Yagi-Uda antenna. Later, Ekran satellites were replaced by more advanced Ekran-M series satellites. In 1979 Soviet engineers developed Moskva (or Moscow) system of broadcasting and delivering of TV signal via satellites. New type of geostationary communication satellites, called Gorizont, were launched. They were equipped by powerful on-board transponders, so the size of receiving parabolic antennas of downlink stations was reduced to 4 and 2.5 meters (in comparison of early 12-meter dishes of standard orbital downlink stations). By 1989 an improved version of Moskva system of satellite television has been called Moskva Global'naya (or Moscow Global). The system included a few geostationary Gorizont and Express type of communication satellites. TV signal from Moscow Global's satellites could be received in any country of planet except Canada and North-West of the USA. Modern Russian satellite broadcasting services based on powerful geostationary buses such as Gals, Ekspress, USP and Eutelsat which provide a large quantity of free-to-air television channels to millions of householders. Pay-TV is growing in popularity amongst Russian TV viewers. The NTV Russia news company, owned by Gazprom, broadcasts the NTV Plus package to 560,000 households, reaching over 1.5 million viewers. Tricolor TV (Russian: –¢—Ä–∏–∫–æ–ª–æ—Ä –¢–í) the biggest satellite television operator. It broadcasts a pack of TV channels in the European part of Russia and most of Siberian, Ural and Far East regions. Broadcasting in the European part has been held since December 2005 from esv Eutelsat W4. Broadcasting in the Eastern regions began in December 2007. The principal difference between Tricolor TV and other Russian satellite TV operators is a pack of free channels broadcasts by Tricolor TV. There are 12 federal channels including \\"Pervy\\", \\"Rossiya\\", \\"NTV\\", \\"STS\\", \\"Bibigon\\" and others in the free \\"Basic\\" pack. Except these, there are 19 more TV channels for the whole family. The budget pack of satellite channels turned to be very popular among Russian viewers. The number of Tricolor TV's subscribers is the largest in Russia. In December 2009, the audience of Tricolor TV reached 6,000,000 households. =Turkey= Turkey's first satellite television channel called TRT launched Intelsat satellite in 1987. On March 1, 1989, Turkey's first private TV channel Star TV (previous Magic Box or Star1) test transmission Eutelsat I F-5 satellite in Germany. In 1990, Star1 channel terrestrial TV transmitter with receive satellite on Turkey. In 1994, T√ºrksat 1B first television channel such as Kent Medya, Kanal E, CTV, BTV, Dokuz TV, KTV, HBB, S√ºper Kanal, Best TV, Medya Teknik Servisler, UBA, Yavuz RTV, √ñzdil TV or MNG TV.https://ekranarkasi.wordpress.com/2015/06/19/uydu-ve-turkiye/ In 1995, Eutelsat satellite transmitted four Turkish TV channel TRT int, atv, TGRT or Interstar. In 1996, Turkey's first digital satellite television channel is Meltem TV. T√ºrksat 1C first television channel such as TRT 1, TRT 2/GAP, TRT 3, TRT 4, TRT int, TRT int-Avrasya, atv, atv int, Kanal D, Euro D, Show TV, Kanal 6, Kanal 7, Samanyolu TV, HBB, Cine5, Maxi TV / Supersport TV, Flash TV, Prima TV, Gen√ß TV, Eko TV, Number One TV, TV1 Azerbaijan, Sun TV, Mesaj TV, Meltem TV, Discovery Channel Turkey, Nickelodeon Turkey, S√ºper TV or Cumhuriyet TV. In 2018, Turkey's watches commonly satellite % 80 penetration. Analogue satellite broadcasting has been discontinued TRT since February 2006. Turkey's satellite TV is majority T√ºrksat satellite over 300+ free-to-air television or radio channel. =Nordic countries= The first satellite service specifically set to the Nordic region was TV3 which launched in 1987. With the launch of Astra 1A, getting the TV3 channel got easier. The first Nordic-specific satellite, Tele-X, was launched in 1989. The services directed at Scandinavia were then scattered among several satellites. In 1993, the former BSB satellites were bought by a Swedish and a Norwegian company, respectively. These two satellites were renamed Thor 1 and Sirius 1, moved to new positions and started broadcasting services intended for people in the Nordic region. With the launch of additional Thor and Sirius satellites later in the 1990s, Astra and other satellites were abandoned by the Nordic services with almost all Nordic satellite television migrating to the Sirius and Thor satellites. Initially the basic channels were free-to-air. This caused several rights problems since viewers throughout Europe were able to see very much acquired English language programming as well as sports for free on the Nordic channels, although the channels only held broadcasting rights for specific countries. One way of avoiding that was to switch from PAL to the D2-MAC standard, hardly used anywhere outside the Nordic region. An unencrypted channel could still be seen in all the Nordic satellite homes, so eventually all channels went encrypted (several of them only being available in one country). There are two competing satellite services: Canal Digital (Norwegian Telenor) and Viasat (Kinnevik). Canal Digital launched in 1997 and was digital from the start, broadcasting from Thor. Kinnevik had been operating an analogue subscription service since the late 1980s, but waited until the year 2000 before launching a digital service. All analogue services from Thor and Sirius will have ceased in 2006, when the three remaining Danish channels go digital-only. The competition between Viasat and Canal Digital has caused some homes in Scandinavia to have to buy two set-top boxes and have two subscriptions to get the full range of channels. Viasat doesn't provide their own channels (TV3, TV3+, ZTV, TV1000 and the Viasat-branded channels) on the Canal Digital platform. Canal Digital does however have exclusive distribution of channels from SBS Broadcasting, Discovery, TV2 Denmark and Eurosport; for several years the Swedish SVT and TV4 channels were also exclusive to Canal Digital. Middle East and North Africa The Middle East has a high penetration of homes receiving TV channels via DTH satellite. One of the pioneers of free-to-air digital satellite television is considered to be MBC, which began broadcasting in C band through Arabsat and is the first network in the world to offer a free-to-air Western based English language movie channel to the Middle East audience via its spinoff channel MBC 2. Its direct rival is considered to be Dubai, UAE based Dubai One, earlier called Ch33 then One TV, which was the first channel in the Middle East and North Africa to provide English language general entertainment programing for both Arabs and the expatriate community. Nourmina Channel is the first satellite channel owned by a Jordanian national of the private sector, which broadcasts on Nile Sat reluctantly 12303H, which covers all the Arab countries, Africa and most parts of Europe \\\\- The first digital DTH pay-TV network to provide Indian Entertainment was Orbit Satellite Television and Radio Network broadcasting via Eurobird 2 (Ku band). Arab Radio and Television Network (ART) is an Arabic-language television network characterized by its multitude of channels. It is based in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Founded in 1993. Showtime Arabia Founded in 1993, a joint venture between Viacom (21% stake) and KIPCO (79% stake) started broadcasting. beIN Sports is a popular sports channel launched in November 2003 as Al Jazeera Sport, beIN Sports also owns the exclusive broadcasting rights in the Arab Middle East for The most important sporting events. In a year 2009 advertise incorporation Between Orbit and Showtime Arabia to become under the name OSN. In the same year rise beIN Sports Buying ART sport channels Which it had owned the rights fifa world cup ,The news sparked uproar in the Arab countries, ART has sold broadcast channels remained to OSN, To announce the death of ART Network. =Israel= In Israel, the satellite television provider yes was founded in 2000. It broadcasts multichannel TV and VOD services via satellites Amos-3 and Amos-7. It also offers DVR capabilities (similar in function to the TiVo) and 4K support.

The launch of the commercial digital channels coincided with the first analog television transmitter switch off in Mildura, Victoria. This was so viewers in the area who lost adequate television coverage were able to utilise VAST as an alternative source. On 10 December 2010, VAST officially launched and began granting access to viewers in the Remote Central and Eastern Australia licence areas. This brought digital television to satellite viewers in the Northern Territory, Queensland and South Australia for the first time. Digital terrestrial transmissions began in Alice Springs, Northern Territory and Mount Isa, Queensland on 2 May 2011, with other areas launching between 2012 and 2013.  Programming  CDT is affiliated to Network Ten, but sources programming from two stations. Ten Central North is based on TVQ Brisbane, and airs Ten Eyewitness News Brisbane nightly at 5pm, as well as sports and events live in the Brisbane market. Ten Central South, Eleven and One are based on TEN Sydney, including news and sports such as Ten Eyewitness News Sydney. Both Ten Central channels also air programming produced by Southern Cross Austereo. Eleven is the same as it is in every region. Availability = Terrestrial = Central Digital Television broadcasts free-to-air digital television channels Ten Central, One and Eleven via terrestrial transmissions in many regional cities and towns. The service is licensed to broadcast within the Remote Central and Eastern Australia TV2 and Mt Isa TV1 licence areas, which include Alice Springs, Bourke, Ceduna, Charleville, Coober Pedy, Cooktown, Katherine, Longreach, Mount Isa, Roma and Weipa, as well as others. = Satellite = A digital satellite transmission of CDT's channels is available free-to-view on the VAST service in all states and territories of Australia, except Western Australia. One is broadcast as a single high definition channel to all viewers, while Ten Central and Eleven are each split into two separate standard definition channels. Ten Central North and Eleven North are broadcast in Australian Eastern Standard Time for viewers in Northern Territory and Queensland (Northern Australia TV3 licence area), and Ten Central South and Eleven South in Australian Eastern Summer Time for viewers in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and Norfolk Island (South Eastern Australia TV3 licence area).

The film is set in modern times, but is in the style of Hong Kong action comedy films from the 1960s and 1970s. The film premiered at the Hong Kong Film Festival on 26 March 2010. The film has received favourable reviews on its festival shows in North America. Plot In modern-day Hong Kong, Leung King-cheung (Wong You-nam) received a job from his real estate company to handle a dispute in a village in the New Territories. Leung arrives and meets with two old martial artists, Tiger (Leung Siu-lung) and Dragon (Chen Kuan-tai), who are being bullied by the young Chung Sang-mang (MC Jin) and his crew. Chung wants Dragon and Tiger to sell their lease on a tea house which was used as a training dojo by their comatose master Law San (Teddy Robin). When Law suddenly wakes up from his 30-year coma, he is determined to restart his school by taking on Chung and his master Pong Ching (Michael Chan). Production Gallants is the directoral debut of Clement Cheng and the third film for his friend director Derek Kwok, as well as a production debut of actor Gordon Lam. The film is produced by Andy Lau's Focus Films, with Lau also serving as executive producer. Gallants was originally conceived as being about a musical group in the 1960s and 1970s. One member suffers a stroke and begins to realise he has not done anything of importance in his life. Feeling that he may die soon, his last wish is to go back to his youth, find all his friends, and do one final show. Finding it difficult to sell the story about musicians, the writers changed the theme of the plot to being about kung fu masters instead. For the cast, Cheng and Kwok felt that if they could not get the actors Chen Kuan-tai and Bruce Leung, they would not make the film. Gallants was shot in 18 days. Release Gallants had its premiere at the Hong Kong International Film Festival on 26 March 2010. It was released in China and Hong Kong on 4 June 2010. Gallants had its North American premiere at the New York Asian Film Festival on 6 July 2010. In Hong Kong, Gallants was the third highest-grossing film on its opening weekend. It grossed a total of $585,848 on its theatrical run. Reception Variety praised the actors in Gallants, noting the charisma of Bruce Leung and Chen Kuan-tai while saying that Teddy Robin \\"steals the show\\". Film Business Asia gave Gallants a 6 out of 10 rating, calling it a \\"Likable but over-loose tribute to Hong Kong martial arts films of the '60s and '70s.\\" The Independent Film Channel gave the film a positive review, noting \\"This could have been an exercise in cheap nostalgia, and it's not. Taken entirely on its own, it's a wholly entertaining and touching movie about friendship and growing old.\\" The Montreal Gazette gave the film three and a half stars, praising the comedic skills of Bruce Leung and Chen Kuan-tai, stating that Gallant \\"has plenty of successful gags, if a few that seem a bit too suited for Nickelodeon at prime-time.\\" Now magazine gave the film a four out of five rating, calling it a \\"very entertaining salute to old legends\\" comparing the film to Kung Fu Hustle. Gallants won the awards for best film and best actor (Teddy Robin) at the 17th Hong Kong Film Critics Society Awards. On The 30th Hong Kong Film Awards, held on 17 April 2011, low-budget 'Gallants' won the prestigious 'best movie' award.È¶ôÊ∏ØÁîµÂΩ±ÈáëÂÉèÂ•ñÔºå‰∏çÂ∞ëÁªèÂÖ∏ÁâáÊÆµ ‚Äì The Hong Kong Film Awards: Many classic moments, a news article about The 30th Hong Kong Film Festival, 17 April 2011, Thinking Chinese.

It was opened on 11 December 2008. Route  The Airport S-Bahn line connects Hamburg-Fuhlsb√ºttel Airport via Ohlsdorf station with central Hamburg. The line, with the exception of a short section to the north of Ohlsdorf, is entirely underground. The tunnel ramp is located directly in front of Klein Borstel station on U-Bahn line U1. The tunnel is built at a depth of up to 30 metres below the surface due to geological conditions. It passes under the Alster river and the large residential area of Fuhlsb√ºttel. Operations  The route is served by S-Bahn line S1. Trains coming from the city are partitioned at the Ohlsdorf station. The front part of the train runs to the airport and the back of the train continues on the original route of line S1 to Poppenb√ºttel. Similarly trains running into the city are coupled together at Ohlsdorf. The journey time from Hamburg Hauptbahnhof to the airport is 24 minutes and it is 25 minutes in the opposite direction. Trains between the city and the airport run at ten-minute intervals during the day and at 20-minute intervals in the early morning and the late evening. The track is operated and monitored from an electronic signal box in Ohlsdorf, which was opened in September 2008, just months before the opening of the airport line. The line is equipped with the modern Ks-signal system and GSM-R digital radio. History  Platforms at the airport station one month before regular operations commenced Platforms at the opening on 11 December 2008 A railway to the airport has been discussed since the 1960s, including as a possible extension of the original route of U-Bahn line 4, on which work was abandoned in 1974. Further planning of a rail connection progressed slowly, partly because until the 1980s, there were plans for a new major airport at Kaltenkirchen, replacing the existing Hamburg airport. It was only after the plans for the new airport were dropped that a new rail link to the airport was re-examined, but little progress was made in the late 1980s due to lack of funding. However, in 1991 a shell for part of a station was built at the airport. In 1998 the Senate of Hamburg (government) decided to expand the airport, including a rail link. Progress was delayed by protests by local residents and work finally began on 11 April 2001. However, work was again delayed by water leaks during construction in 2004 and the line was finally opened to regular traffic on 12 December 2008. On the previous day free familiarisation trips operated to the airport station. Extensions  Under the air train (Flugzug) concept, the S-Bahn line would be extended north of the airport the line to connect with the line of the AKN Railway or the Alster Northern Railway. Connection to an upgraded AKN-trunk line via Henstedt- Ulzburg and Kaltenkirchen would create a Kiel‚ÄìHamburg Airport‚ÄìHamburg line, allowing connections between many parts of Schleswig-Holstein and the airport. Line data  The track is designed for a maximum speed of 80 km / h and electrified with the third-rail DC system used by the Hamburg S-Bahn. The tunnel ramp has a slope of 8.0 percent. Hamburg Airport (Flughafen) station has a 140 metre long central platform and is therefore suitable for the assembly of trains. The total cost of the project (as of 2008) was about ‚Ç¨280 million, with 60% of funds coming from the city of Hamburg and 40% from the federal government. In the early days about 13,500 passengers a day were expected. Discussion on the station name  Until September 2008 it was envisaged that the new station would be named Hamburg Airport, that is, using English only. Following the current addition of the German term, Flughafen to the name, the Hamburg government responded to a joint request of its Christian Democratic Union and Green/Alternative List Hamburg members to change the name to Flughafen (Hamburg Airport). The proposal responded to complaints regarding the over-use of Anglicisms. Within days of the application the government distanced itself from the proposal, as modification would have led to significant costs for, for example, the reprinting of timetables and maps. Critics of the proposed change also suggested that an internationally oriented place like the airport station should use an English name. Nevertheless, the main signing of S-Bahn stations at Frankfurt Airport and Munich Airport use German names as well as English.

Until the mid-1990s he maintained organic growth within the Valpara√≠so Province and the historic Los Lagos province now split into Los Lagos and Los R√≠os provinces. In 1996 an aggressive plan was started to expand the company both nationally and internationally. During this expansion the company went public and entered the Chilean capital region, Peru, and Paraguay under the subsidiary Supermercados Stock. In July 1996 the company bought Multimarket's 25 locations in Santiago and the country's south under the Multimarket and Gigante monikers. During September of said year Santa Isabel acquired ten Marmentini Letelier stores in the Metropolitana Region and San Antonio areas. At the same time the company expanded to Ecuador. In 1997 the company was acquired by Velox Group, owner of Argentine stores Disco. Towards the end of the 1990s the company operated 63 branches in Chile under the Santa Isabel namesake in Chile and also Hipermercados Stock in Peru and Ecuador. Another location in Limache.

History The first students in the town of Buckeye graduated in 1921. Regular graduating classes began the next year for what was then known as Buckeye High School, and there were 23 alumni by 1925. In its first few years, the high school used four rooms of the Buckeye elementary school on Sixth Street; the other four, on the other side of the building, were used for the lower grades. Finally, the towns of Buckeye, Palo Verde, Arlington, and Liberty came together with the goal of forming an accredited high school. In the fall of 1929, the new Buckeye Union High School (serving several elementary school districts) opened its doors with some 100 students. The school's mascot changed twice in the first ten years as the school's athletics program developed. A football team was first organized in 1923. The original name for the school's teams was the Wildcats at the creation of interscholastic sports in 1925, followed by the Buckeyes in the late 1920s, then the Hawks in 1929 (beating out Farmers in a schoolwide vote). Other traditions were being solidified: the school's first yearbook was published in 1925 (the yearbook title changed twice before the current \\"Falcon\\" in 1935). The original school song \\"Hurrah for the Blue and Gold\\" was written in 1924. The 1930s saw continued student growth; the enrollment was 229 by 1941, necessitating more facilities. In late 1929, a building blitz began: two wings, an auditorium, and a gymnasium. The WPA helped the school in the 1930s to build a shop and garage, dressing rooms for the auditorium, tennis courts, and a lighted football field with bleachers. Buckeye Union just kept growing. There were 280 students by 1950. A new football field came with the B building; a new gymnasium highlighted the middle of the decade; the front of the shop was partly rebuilt in 1959. By 1960, with 550 students, the district hired its first superintendent. Under Chester D. McNabb, Buckeye Union High School continued its expansion. Student traditions continued to evolve, with a new fight song (\\"BUHS, Hats Off to You\\") popularized in the mid-1960s. The C, D, and E wings helped to accommodate a student boom (832 students by 1975), a new library opened, the campus received landscaping, and the football stadium was expanded. The faculty size had nearly doubled by 1975. At the same time, in the wake of the passage of Title IX, girls' athletics expanded from just tennis to a fully featured program. The growth finally stabilized out at about 800 students in the 1980s and early 1990s, but bonds passed in 1980 and 1990 enabled the district to invest in updated facilities and a computer-networked campus. The expansion and modernization enabled Buckeye Union to handle a two-year bump of more than 100 students from 1993 to 1995. The new growth was unremitting, as Buckeye Union enrollment crossed the 1,000 mark. At last, Buckeye Union High School was overcrowded. With the district's service area continuing to develop, a second high school was needed. Ground broke in 2000 for the new Estrella Foothills High School, and the school opened in 2002. With an eye to needed modernizations (the main building on campus was the old 1929 A building), renovation plans began. Ground broke in January 2003 for a new Buckeye Union campus; within a year, students had been moved to the new plant. The old B, C, D, and E wings were demolished, and further phases of the project unfolded throughout the 2000s with a new gymnasium, tennis courts, parking lots, and (in the final 2008 phase) a performing arts center and refurbished baseball field. By 2006, Buckeye Union had 1,646 students. The district embarked on building yet another high school. In August 2007, Youngker High School opened its doors. The new school helped to bring down Buckeye Union's enrollment to 1,136 in 2011-12. On Tuesday 22 August 2016, a 10th grade student, Ms Mariah Havard, was asked to remove her \\"Black Lives Matter\\" T-shirt for her school picture, after another (caucasian) student first told her that \\"Black lives don't matter\\" and then complained to the staff. The vice-principal found a white shirt for her to wear. Another student, Ms Genesis Santoyo was also obliged to change her \\"Black Lives Matter\\" T-shirt. It is reported that many other T-shirts with messages of one kind and another are generally worn including those with Confederate flags. There was subsequently a peaceful protest demonstration by about 10 students and some parents. The school principal has put out two written statements saying that the school is working to resolve the situation, but at the time of writing (31August16)it is not known if an apology has been made to either girl, or whether disciplinary measures are to be taken against either the student who complained or any of the staff involved in the action. https://www.buzzfeed.com/tasneemnashrulla/buckeye-high-school-black-lives- matter-protesthttp://www.abc15.com/news/region-west-valley/buckeye/students- at-buckeye-school-stage-walk-out-over-black-lives-matter-controversy National Register of Historic Places listing The school's A-wing, now owned by the town of Buckeye, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places at the end of 2009.

The project began in 2012, when the Buckeye Union School district entered into a 25-year agreement with Constellation Energy, an energy company based in Baltimore, Maryland. As per this agreement, Constellation Energy installed, owns, and will maintain the $18.6 million worth of equipment, and the Buckeye school district will purchase energy produced by the system at a fixed rate of $.098 per kilowatt hour. The agreement is expected to result in $100,000 of annual savings for the school district, and offset 2,296,422 lbs of CO2 per year.

Situated approximately 30 miles west of Phoenix, Arizona the district serves approximately 3710 students in three comprehensive high schools and one alternative school. The district was founded in 1913 as Buckeye School District #33 and was later renamed to its current Buckeye Union High School District in 1930.[Trevizo, The Arizona Republic] It operates Buckeye Union, Estrella Foothills, and Youngker high schools, as well as the Learning Center, an alternative school. Dr. Beverly Hurley has been the superintendent since 2003. History As early as 1913, Professor L.O. DuRoss, principal of Buckeye Grammar School, published in the local newspaper, the Buckeye Valley News, the need for all nearby school districts to combine resources to form one substantial high school that benefited residents of each district.Buckeye Union High School District Archives file:bhistory The Buckeye School District gradually worked toward this goal by adding 10th and 11th grades in 1914 and 12th grade in 1920. By 1921, the Buckeye School qualified enough of its educational program to grant diplomas to two senior students. Then, beginning in 1922, a class graduated each year from the facilities shared with Buckeye Elementary School. It is important to note that prior to 1922, high school seniors had to complete their last year at Phoenix Union High School or at another accredited institution.Buckeye Union High School District Archives file:Timeline In February 1928 the Buckeye Board of Trustees approved a bond election for a new high school to be built at another site in Buckeye. Land was donated by local residents and, in September 1929, the doors of the new high school building built by Buckeye School District #33 opened at 902 Eason Avenue with approximately 60 students enrolled.Buckeye Union High School Archives file:benroll At the same time a movement within the community advocated for the creation of a union high school, and a proposition was presented to voters living in the local school districts to establish a new and separate union high school district. The proposition reportedly had widespread support in all districts except one and the measure passed with little opposition. The new Buckeye Union High School Board was certified in a joint board meeting on June 24, 1929. The new board held an election, was organized and soon earned its accreditation from North Central Association of Secondary Schools. In the first year of the newly christened Buckeye Union High School, about 100 students worked under five teachers.Buckeye Union High School District Archives file:benroll Subjects taught were restricted to three years of English (taught every other year) with the teaching of English IV as an alternative, two years of math, language and history, and one year each of typing, shorthand, bookkeeping, government, and biology. No vocational work was offered. Many school traditions began in 1925 with the inclusion of most interscholastic sports teams, although the first football team was organized in 1923. At the time, the athletic teams were known as the \\"Wildcats‚Äù, but in 1929, the BUHS mascot became the \\"Hawks\\", narrowly defeating the \\"Farmers\\" in a school-wide vote. Also in 1925, the first yearbook was published and called El Ocotillo, followed by the Buckeye in 1929. It was not until 1935 the student body changed the name to the Falcon to distinguish it from the school newspaper, the Hawk. In 1924, the school song \\"Hurrah for the Blue and Gold\\" was written. The BUHS fight song, \\"BUHS, Hats Off To You\\" became the more popular school song in the mid-1960s.Buckeye Union High School District Archives file:bhistory Additional facilities soon became necessary as the student population expanded from 60 students in 1929 to 229 in 1941. .Buckeye Union High School District Archives file:benroll The auditorium, the east and west wings, and the gymnasium were added to the original Eason Avenue facility during the summer and fall of 1929. During the Depression years, with the assistance of the Works Progress Administration, a shop and garage were built, plus additional auditorium dressing rooms, tennis courts, and a football field with lights and bleachers.Buckeye Union High School District Archives file:bhistory Throughout the 1950s growth and a need to update aging facilities spawned a period of growth to the school's physical campus. In 1950, with enrollment growing to 280 students, the district completed the ‚ÄúB‚Äù wing of the school, and a new football field was built in its present location, just north of the school. The middle of the decade witnessed the old gymnasium torn down and a new one built while the front part of the shop area was rebuilt in 1959. The baseball field in Buckeye Park was also finished in 1959 and was later named Ellis Field on April 23, 1960 in honor of Principal Alvin E. Ellis who had died the previous school year.Buckeye Union High School District Archives file:bhistory Beginning in 1960, with an approximate enrollment of 550, Chester D. McNabb was hired as BUHSD's first superintendent. During his twenty-year tenure, the district saw unprecedented growth both in enrollment and the physical campus. The ‚ÄúC‚Äù, ‚ÄúD‚Äù, and ‚ÄúE‚Äù wings were added to accommodate the student body, as it increased to 832 students by 1975. A library was completed in 1975 and quickly became the hub of the educational system on campus. There were also multiple additions to the football stadium, and the campus was landscaped with numerous palm and mulberry trees. The size of the faculty nearly doubled by 1975, and new programs in vocational education began. With the passing of the Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972 by the United States Congress, the girls‚Äô athletic program began to evolve beyond a simple tennis program into a full interscholastic athletic department. While the district's enrollment stabilized and averaged just over 800 students throughout the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s,Buckeye Union High School District Archives file:benroll the community showed their support for the school passing bonds in 1980 and 1990. The funds raised through the issuance of the bonds allowed BUHSD to expand and update its facilities, including the construction of a campus fully networked by computers to meet the current and future education needs of its students. As a result of these measures, when the BUHS's enrollment boomed from 830 students in 1993 to 947 students in 1995,Buckeye Union High School District Archives file:benroll the district was prepared to handle the quick influx of new students. BUHS saw its enrollment cross the millennium mark with 1,029 students, and it has remained above that mark ever since. Eventually, enrollment plateaued at 1,646 students during the 2007‚Äì08 and 2008-09 school years.Buckeye Union High School District Archives file:benroll Because of consistently high growth within the district's boundaries, a new school had to be built to alleviate the pressure on the district's lone high school, Buckeye Union. Groundbreaking for Estrella Foothills High School (EFHS) was held Sept. 20, 2000, and opening ceremonies and classes began on August 31, 2002.[Mendoza, The Arizona Republic] Foothills, as it is commonly called, opened with approximately 150 freshmen, a new mascot the ‚ÄúWolf‚Äù, and is located at 13033 S. Estrella Parkway in Goodyear, Arizona. The district's third school became official in the fall of 2003, with the establishment of the Buckeye Academy. This alternative school is designed for students who have had difficulty succeeding in a traditional high school setting. Approximately 30 students were enrolled at the campus located in the old Masonic Lodge building on 4th Street and Narramore in Buckeye. The school's lead teacher was Johnny Ray. In 2011, a new facility was built at 751 N. 215th Avenue in Buckeye. The new facility, now named the BUHSD Learning Center, focuses on a dual role of accommodating special needs students living within BUHSD's boundaries and neighboring communities and computer based instruction for students seeking an alternative learning environment. During the 2001-02 school year, plans were made through Student First Legislature Plan to renovate the school, whose main building was built in 1929.Buckeye Union High School District Archives file:bhistory Construction for the new facilities began on January 24, 2003 with the footprint of the new BUHS campus located just east of the football stadium. Plans also called for the original building on Eason Avenue to become District offices. On December 19, 2003, movers came to the old campus and on January 5, 2004, students began the New Year on the new campus. The demolition of the old B-C-D-E wings and of the Maintenance, Industrial Arts and Agriculture areas began as construction continued and the new campus began to take shape over the next two years with a new gymnasium, tennis courts, and parking lots. BUHS finished the renovation of its current campus by adding a new Performing Arts Center and refurbished Ellis Baseball Field in 2008.Buckeye Union High School District Archives file:benroll The district continued to grow with the ground breaking of Youngker High School on April 17, 2006 located at 3000 S. Apache Road in Buckeye. Youngker officially opened in August, 2007 with approximately 300 students, and a new mascot, the \\"Rough Riders\\". Johnny Ray, formerly the lead teacher at Buckeye Academy, was called on to be YHS's first principal. Because of Youngker's close proximity to BUHS, Buckeye Union's student enrollment decreased to 1,499 in 2009 and has since fallen to 1,136 for the 2011-12 school year. The historic A Wing of the original Buckeye Union High School, now owned by the Town of Buckeye, received national historic designation on December 30, 2009. As a result, the official street address for BUHS and the district's offices changed to 1000 E. Narramore instead of 902 E Eason Ave. In 2011, BUHSD celebrated the 90th anniversary of its first graduating class from Buckeye High School (now Buckeye Union High School) in 1921.[Trevizo , The Arizona Republic] Schools * Buckeye Union High School * Estrella Foothills High School * Youngker High School Alternative school * The Learning Center Feeder elementary school districts * Arlington * Buckeye * Liberty * Palo Verde Notes References *Mendoz, M.

Hugh Anderson, 'Macdonald, Donald Alaster (1859‚Äì1932)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Vol. 10, Melbourne University Press, 1986, p. 249. Retrieved 14 November 2010 He was considered one of Australia's widely known journalists, and is in the Melbourne Press Club's Australian Media Hall of Fame. He was credited with making 'Australian natural history and botany popular interests'. Early life Macdonald was born in Fitzroy, Victoria, a suburb of Melbourne, the elder son of Donald Macdonald (of Scottish‚ÄìCanadian heritage) and his wife Margaret, n√©e Harris. Macdonald was educated at the Keilor state school where he became a pupil- teacher in 1876. He later joined The Corowa Free Press and then the Melbourne Argus newspaper in 1881. On 26 February 1883 at Scots' Church, Melbourne, Macdonald married Jessie Seward (‚Äì18 September 1934) in 1883. Seward was from a pioneering family of the Victorian Rochester area. Their only daughter (J)essie Elaine (1885‚Äì2 July 1948), married in 1910 to James Service Northam Whittle, also became a traveller and free lance journalist (writing under the pen name 'Taunton Vale'). Career Writing under the pen name 'Observer', Macdonald established himself as a cricket and Australia rules football commentator. Macdonald \\"completely revolutionized cricket reporting\\" ‚Äî he made the reports more vivid than the earlier over-by-over style. Macdonald was first Australian war correspondent at the South African War; during the war he was besieged at Ladysmith. Macdonald's despatches from Ladysmith were eventually sent to Australia and published in the Argus. Later they were reprinted in a book How we kept the flag flying: The story of the siege of Ladysmith (1900). He returned to Australia in April‚ÄìMay 1900. Macdonald established a weekly column in the Argus called 'Nature Notes and Queries'; in 1909 it was extended to 'Notes for Boys'. 1909 'NOTES FOR BOYS.

Macdonald also compiled the Tourists' Handbook of Australia (1905) and wrote a novel, The Warrigal's Well (1901), in collaboration with John F. Edgar. Later years Macdonald died at his residence The Huts, Karrakatta Street, Black Rock, Victoria (a seaside suburb of Melbourne), on 23 November 1932, had a private funeral and cremation, and was survived by his daughter. Memorials By May 1937 the Sandringham municipal council had purchased land at Black Rock to be used as a bird sanctuary as the 'Donald Macdonald Park'. The park today is an area between Fourth, Stawell, and Keating Streets, and Haydens Road. Within the reserve is a playing field, skate park, playground, and the Beaumaris scout den. Additionally, a large memorial bird bath bearing his portrait in bronze was unveiled on Sunday 17 December 1939 at the Black Rock park by his daughter who had just returned from England. It was designed by sculptor Stanley Hammond, following contributions of many readers of The Argus and The Australasian from 1937. The plaque read: ::Donald MacDonald, friend of the creatures of the wild, chose this district in which to live and to end his days. ::Born at Fitzroy 1857, died at Black Rock 1932. ::Erected by readers of his \\"Nature Notes\\" in the Argus.

Rainfall totals reached 38.76 in (985 mm) at Kapapala Ranch on the Big Island of Hawaii, which was the second highest precipitation total in the state related to a tropical cyclone. The floods led to $70 million (2000 USD; $ USD) in damage, but there were no fatalities. Meteorological history Tropical Storm Paul formed on October 25 from the Intertropical Convergence Zone to the southwest of Mexico, and it dissipated four days later without becoming a significant tropical cyclone. The remnants of Paul reached the Hawaiian Islands in early November 2000, and interacted with an upper-level low, dropping very heavy rains from November 1 to November 3. On the island of Hawaii, more commonly referred to as \\"the Big Island\\", roughly the entire eastern half of the island experienced rainfall of at least 10 in (254 mm), while the western side reported generally less than 5 in (127 mm) or less. A station in Hilo reported in a 24‚Äëhour period, breaking the record set in February 1979 by more than . Additionally, was recorded on November 2, which set the new calendar day total for the month of November, surpassing the previous total of on November 18, 1990. Near Ka Lae, the southernmost point in the United States, rainfall reached nearly 5 in (127 mm). Rainfall peaked at an extreme amount of 38.76 in (985 mm) at Kapapala Ranch. In addition, the 24 hour rainfall total reached 37 in (940 mm), which is just 1 in (25 mm) shy of the record amount of precipitation in the state of Hawaii set on January 25, 1956. That total was the second-highest tropical cyclone-related rainfall total in the state, although well behind Hurricane Hiki of 1950, which dropped 52 in (1321 mm). Impact and records Rainfall totals on the island of Hawaii The most affected districts were Hilo, Ka‚Äôu and Puna, and the flooding damaged homes, businesses, roads, and public facilities. Near Pahala, the flooding cut a portion of Route 11, leaving the city's fire station only accessible by helicopter. The flooding caused several mudslides across the island of Hawaii, and most schools and businesses were closed. Additionally, dozens of people were forced to evacuate. The Red Cross indicated that the 33 homes and apartments were destroyed as a result of the flood, and another 265 sustaining damage. Some bridges were damaged during the flooding, which temporarily closed several roads and highways on the southeast side of the island of Hawaii. The flooding resulted in $70 million (2000 USD; $ USD) worth of property damage, but no fatalities were reported. Four people required rescuing after flood waters entered their house. Few reports of impact exist other than on the island of Hawaii, although reports of stream and minor street flooding was observed on the islands of Molokai, Lanai, Maui, and on the eastern side of Oahu. Aftermath Flooding along the Alenaio Stream on the Big Island of Hawaii On November 3, shortly after the flooding, a state of emergency was declared for the island of Hawaii. The same day, then-Hawaiian Governor Ben Cayetano also declared a state of emergency. Because of the extreme flooding, then-United States President Bill Clinton declared the island of Hawaii as a disaster area, allowing the victims to receive aid from the federal government. The county government of the Big Island spent $8.7 million (2000 USD) in repairs, primarily to bridges and flood controls. In Hilo, crews worked quickly to remove mud and debris from roadways, and in Pahala, the county government constructed a temporary bypass road in just one week. On November 13 and November 15, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and Hawaii State Civil Defense opened disaster recovery centers in Hilo and Pahala, respectively, to provide the affected people with information about disaster assistance programs, among other details; by the end of November, 1,168 people visited the centers. In the week after the flooding, the American Red Cross sheltered 214 people, providing a total of 1289 meals. By December 4, 1,131 island residents applied for federal assistance. The registration for federal assistance ended on January 8, 2001, by which time over 2,000 people applied for assistance, and the Small Business Administration approved $4.6 million in low-interest disaster loans. Over 1,100 people applied for over $2.4 million in temporary housing checks for rent or minimal repairs, and over $1.1 million in grants were approved for those with serious, disaster-related needs. Overall, federal disaster assistance totaled $88 million for Hawaii, due to the flooding event.

His first venture of kayal cultivation was the reclamation of Cherukara Kayal. During 1898-1904, he reclaimed the Pallithanam Moovayiram Kayal and Madathil Kayal but could not progress further because of a ban on reclamation imposed by the Travancore Raja in 1904. That ban was removed in 1914, after which Matthai and some other prominent families in Kuttanadu, reclaimed E-Block Kayal, which covered . This is the biggest kayal nilam in Kuttanadu.

His life marked the beginning of the epoch of first generation Kayal Raja's of Kuttanad.(Kayal Raja is the term generally used to refer to the prominent kayal cultivators in the Kuttanadu region). In 1931, in order to strengthen the farming community in Kuttanadu, he founded Kuttandu Karshaka Sangham. He spearheaded the debt relief struggle that resulted in the enactment of the Agricultural Debt Relief Act. Our Lady of Dolours Church in Kainady village stands on land donated by him. Using his influence as a member of the Praja Sabha, he established a primary school in Kainady in 1921 and in the initial years he acted as the manager of it. This school was later named as A J John Memorial High School. Matthai was among the founders of the All-Kerala Catholic Congress. Though he belonged to an aristocratic and orthodox Syrian Christian family, he actively supported his contemporary and great social reformer Ayyankali in his efforts in eradicating the social inequalities that were prevalent in the Kerala society. He invited Ayyankali to the ancestral home of Pallithanam. In a great event, accompanied by many boats, Ayyankali, along with his followers, reached the Pallithanam Tharavad, and as a token of protest against casteism made 'Panthi Bhojanam' . He died on Christmas Day, 1962.

There has been debate among archaeologists whether the definition of historical archaeology should be time-based (such as \\"the archaeology of the modern world\\", where \\"modern\\" is defined as 1500 CE onward), subject-based (for example, \\"the archaeology of capitalism\\" or method-based (such as \\"text-aided archaeology\\").Orser, Charles E 2002, Encyclopaedia of historical archaeology Routledge, London ; New York ppxiii In Australia much of this discussion has been avoided, and definitions of historical archaeology (such as those adopted by the Australasian Society for Historical Archaeology and government regulatory agencies) have focused on a definition emphasising the combined use of documentary and material evidence.see http://www.asha.org.au/historical-archaeology/ and http://www.heritage.nsw.gov.au/06_subnav_02.htm In contrast with archaeological practice in the United Kingdom and the United States, historical archaeology in Australia has been intimately linked with industrial archaeology (sharing common practitioners, research goals and training). Eleanor Casella has noted this association, and the generally positive effect it has had on both fields of study. Historical archaeologists in Australia are better able to understand industrial processes, and industrial archaeologists better able to understand social processes because of this linkage.Casella Eleanor, 2006 ‚ÄúTransplanted technologies and rural relics: Australian Industrial Archaeology and questions that matter‚Äù, Australasian Historical Archaeology, 24:65-75 The techniques of historical archaeology have also been applied to \\"contact sites\\" (Aboriginal historical archaeology). This area of study has looked at the encounters between Aboriginal people and settlers,Paterson, Alistair, 2002 \\"Australian Aboriginal historical archaeology\\", in Orser, Charles E 2002, Encyclopaedia of historical archaeology, Routledge, London ; New York pp38-42. and has been seen as an overlap of research interests between groups of archaeologists, historians and the Aboriginal community. Maritime archaeology in Australia may be considered as a discipline within historical archaeology; there is a considerable overlap in interests and techniques, which has been recognised by close relationships between two professional bodies: the Australasian Society for Historical Archaeology and the Australasian Institute for Maritime Archaeology. History  The origins of historical archaeology in Australia are generally believed to lie in archaeological investigations by the late William (Bill) Culican at Fossil Beach in Victoria,Culican, William & Taylor, John, (joint author.) 1972, Fossil Beach cement works, Mornington, Victoria : an essay in industrial archaeology Refulgence Publishers, Deception Bay, Qld research at Port Essington, Northern Territory by Jim Allen at the Australian National University in 1966-1968Allen, Jim 2008, Port Essington : the historical archaeology of a north Australian nineteenth century military outpost, Sydney University Press in association with the Australasian Society for Historical Archaeology and Judy Birmingham (from the University of Sydney) working at Irrawang Pottery in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales from 1967 to 1975. In 1973, Birmingham and historian Ian Jack proposed a course in historical archaeology at the University of Sydney. As detailed by Jack, the proposal was fought by conservative members of the archaeology department; however, it was accepted and the first course in historical archaeology in Australia was taught in 1974 by Birmingham and Jack with contributions from geographer Dennis Jeans and historian Ken Cable. The course had a significant fieldwork component, to give students practical training. As noted by Jack, a number students from the first years of the course went on to contribute in their own right as archaeological consultants or in government.Jack, Ian 2006 ‚ÄúHistorical Archaeology, Heritage and the University of Sydney‚Äù, Australasian Historical Archaeology 24:19-24  References  Category:Archaeology of Australia Category:Historiography of Australia ","title":"Historical archaeology in Australia"},{"id":"29590145","text":"Mickey's Warriors is a 1930 short film in Larry Darmour's Mickey McGuire series starring a young Mickey Rooney.

He attended the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts from 1863 to 1868 and studied privately with P. C. Skovgaard (1817‚Äì1875). He made his debut as a painter in 1866. In 1869, he received the Neuhausens Prize. In 1875, he received the Royal Academy's travel scholarship and traveled to Italy, where he lived from 1875 to 1878. He became acquainted with but remained relatively unaffected by the latest Realist tendencies in European painting. In 1880, alongside Laurits Tuxen (1853‚Äì1927) and Frans Schwartz (1850‚Äì1917), he was a co-founder of a painting academy at S√∏kv√¶sthuset on Christianshavn in Copenhagen which served as a precursor of Kunstnernes Frie Studieskoler which were founded two years later. He received the Thorvaldsen Medal in 1884 and became a professor at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in 1891. Paintings Jerndorff started his career as a landscape painter under the influence of Skovgaard, but soon turned to portrait painting and Biblical subjects. He is best known for a number of monumental portraits which were painted for the Danish museum of National History at Frederiksborg Castle. His religious paintings include 12 Apostles for Jesus Church in Copenhagen, altar pieces for Saint Peter's Church and the church in Nyk√∏bing Mors, and landscapes. =Decorative arts= Together with Thorvald Bindesb√∏ll, Otto Haslund, and Joakim Skovgaard, Jerndorff also worked with ceramics in the mid-1880s, a collaboration that led to the foundation of the Dekorationsforeningen society in 1887. With the same collaborators he illustrated Holger Drachmann's Troldh√∏j. Personal life In 1875, he married Betty Marie Matthison-Hansen (1856-1940).

Believing that he was only opposed by the Austrian VIII Armeekorps, Eug√®ne launched his right wing in a heavy attack against it. In the morning, the Austrians successfully held off Franco-Italian assaults on their left flank as Eug√®ne reinforced the attack with troops from his left wing. Later in the day, John counterattacked Eug√®ne's weakened left wing with the IX Armeekorps, forcing the Franco-Italian army to withdraw from the battlefield. The battle at Sacile was preceded by the action of Pordenone on 15 April in which the Austrian advance guard mauled the French rear guard. The Austrian victory compelled Eug√®ne to retreat to the Adige River at Verona where he gathered reinforcements and planned a counteroffensive.Schneid, Frederick C.

Released in the UK in 2010, and by Lyons Press in the US in 2011, it is a profile of President of the United States John F. Kennedy's 1963 visit to Ireland. A spokesperson for Eason & Son was reported to have called it \\"one of the most highly anticipated literary events of the year\\". Tubridy was exempted from paying income tax on his work, leading to criticism from politicians and the media. The broadcaster said he would send copies of the book to both the Kennedy family and the White House. The book contains photographs of Kennedy's visit. A documentary, JFK: A Homecoming, by Ryan Tubridy was broadcast on RT√â One prior to the book's release. Bernice Harrison, reviewing the week's television in The Irish Times, commented: \\"The timing of this history documentary ‚Äì not the usual bank-holiday viewing, not an anniversary of the visit, no new revelations ‚Äì was peculiar until you noted that RT√â's star presenter has a book coming out this week about the JFK visit. Nice publicity if you can get it\\". Background For more than ‚Ç¨100,000 HarperCollins signed Tubridy as part of a two-book deal. They wanted an autobiography but he persuaded them otherwise. The broadcaster said he had thought about going back to college before taking on the task of writing this book. Overview JFK in Ireland serves as a profile of John F. Kennedy's 1963 visit to Ireland while he was President of the United States. Kennedy referred to this visit as \\"the best 'four days of his life' and it occurred five months before his assassination. Tubridy's book discusses how Kennedy's visit affected the country, wondering if it was an inspirational one and featuring rare photographs and personal documents. Research While researching the book, Tubridy discovered that √âamon de Valera (then President of Ireland) had part of Kennedy's speech to D√°il √âireann erased from all records after finding its content offensive. Intended as a joke, the comment \\"Leinster House does not inspire the brightest ideas\\" led to a \\"dressing down\\" for Kennedy and Taoiseach Se√°n Lemass to question this \\"utter suppression\\" by de Valera. Contrary to Tubridy's claim, however, the full text of the speech can be found on the Oireachtas website. Launch JFK in Ireland was launched at the Mansion House, Dublin on 27 October 2010. There was some speculation beforehand over whether Aoibhinn N√≠ Sh√∫illeabh√°in would make an appearance. She did and Tubridy posed for photographs alongside her. He described her as \\"my date for the evening\\" and would not confirm if there was any romance involved. Tubridy praised his family and requested applause be given for his friend and colleague Gerry Ryan who had died earlier that year. The Irish Independent newspaper published two supplements based on Tubridy's research alongside input from historians Tim Pat Coogan and Diarmaid Ferriter on the day of the launch and the following day. Tubridy signed copies of his book at Shop Street in Galway on 3 November 2010. Reception Tubridy thought critics would give the book \\"a bit of a kicking\\" due to his own popularity. Miss N√≠ Sh√∫illeabh√°in commented: \\"The book looks brilliant - he [Tubridy] put an awful lot of work into it. It is a great product, and he is very proud of it. Even though I am not very interested in history myself, it is easy to see it is a wonderful book\\". Deagl√°n de Br√©ad√∫n of The Irish Times praised the photographs, describing them as \\"like going through a family album\\", but was less keen on Tubridy's writing skills: \\"Tubridy is a good writer, not a great writer, but it is the photographs that form the primary merit of this beautifully produced volume\\", he wrote. Dubray Books reported that thousands of copies of JFK in Ireland were ordered in advance of the launch. The book entered the Eason bestseller list at number two but fell to number four in the second week, being beaten by sales of Paul Howard's latest Ross O'Carroll- Kelly book, a Jamie Oliver cookbook and Johnny Giles's autobiography. By 10 November, JFK in Ireland had sold 1,116 books. In March 2012, Tubridy made his American television debut on MSNBC's Morning Joe, during which he discussed the book. His debut was received positively by industry professionals. Willie Geist, one of the presenters of the show, said Tubridy was ‚Äùthe biggest star in Ireland and perhaps in that nation's history‚Äù. Tax controversy JFK in Ireland was granted tax-free status, meaning that Tubridy did not have to pay any income tax on the estimated ‚Ç¨480,000 he earned from the book. This decision was criticised due to Tubridy's perceived wealth and the large salary he receives from RT√â. The Revenue granted it a \\"favourable determination\\". MEP Joe Higgins said: \\"The fact that Ryan Tubridy is claiming the exemption is ridiculous, there is no question about that. The rule should be changed, full stop.\\" References External links * Book launch photos * More launch photos (archive) * Another one * JFK in Ireland: Four Days That Changed a President Category:2010 non-fiction books Category:Irish non-fiction books Category:Books about John F.

He also convened the First and Second International Lonergan Conferences at Rome (2001) and Toronto (2004), and the Third and Fourth International Lonergan Conferences at Mainz and Jerusalem (2013) respectively. Lawrence was a student of Bernard Lonergan at the Gregorian University, Rome, and is today one of the foremost interpreters of Lonergan's thought and an acknowledged hermeneutic philosopher in his own right. He did his PhD on the \\"unlikely topic\\" of the hermeneutical circle in the thought of Gadamer and Lonergan. The thesis had the unique distinction of being appreciated by both thinkers.B.

He is a graduate of Texas A&M; University with a Bachelor of Environmental Design and master's degree in Architecture. Upon completion of graduate school he received the American Institute of Architects Medal and Certificate for the Outstanding Graduate for the 1975-76 school year. He is a registered architect in the state of Texas. Since 1975 Mark has pursued dual careers, one in art and the other in architecture. Mark and his family currently reside in Houston, Texas. Mark began drawing as a means of expression and exploration as a small child, but did not begin painting until after graduation from college. For the most part, he is self-taught, drawing experience from careful studies of the works of realist painters like Winslow Homer, Andrew Wyeth, Edward Hopper, and impressionist and abstract painters like Wolf Kahn and Cy Twombly. Concerning his subject matter, he likes to emphasize simpler things which suggest use by people, a time or an atmosphere. Finding and expressing mystery in everyday life has always been Mark's artistic credo...the patternless life and color of a crazy quilt, the silent invitation of a canoe waiting to cross the open water, the poignance of a child's abandoned tea party. Mark prefers realism, breaking from the current trends in American art toward abstraction and expressionism. His deep personal faith forms a basis from which to verify and depict reality. Not wanting to slavishly copy nature, he strives to observe and create an interpretation consistent with reality and his personal experience. Since 1980, when Mark began commercially exhibiting his watercolors, he has had many one man exhibitions of his work and has been represented by galleries around the United States. The quality of his work has been recognized over the years in numerous art magazine articles, gallery shows and museum exhibits. While being featured twice in SouthWest Art magazine, his work appeared on the cover of the September 1987 issue. He has illustrated two book covers, and in 1988 New York Graphic Society began printing a selection of his work for worldwide distribution and in 2002 Bruce McGaw Graphics also began printing Mark's work.

Early life Randolph was born in Charles City County, Virginia. He was the youngest son of William Randolph and Mary (n√©e Isham) Randolph. He was a grand-uncle of U.S. President Thomas Jefferson. Randolph later reflected, \\"I should have been an atheist if it had not been for one recollection‚Äîand that was the memory of the time when my departed mother used to take my little hand in hers and cause me on my knees to say, 'Our Father who art in heaven.'\\" He attended the College of William & Mary and completed his studies in 1711. Career In 1712, the Lieutenant Governor of Virginia, Alexander Spotswood, appointed Randolph as Deputy Attorney General for Charles City County, Prince George County, and Henrico County. On May 17, 1715, Randolph was admitted to Gray's Inn at the Inns of Court, then called to the bar on November 25, 1717. Randolph was the only native of Colonial Virginia to receive a knighthood.

After she lands in Saudi Arabia, she is forced to wear a burqa at all times, due to the strict dress code of the country. She is subsequently exposed to a slavery-like vocation and is taken up under a sponsor to work for him as a maid. Aswathi had to face numerous troubles - sexual abuse and battery in the sponsor's house. Aswathi is accompanied by Usman, who actually brought her to all the miseries. However, he indulges in a sexual affair with the Indonesian maid there and gets caught and is kicked out of the sponsor's house. Aswathi helps the other maid to escape the premises and in turn is tortured as punishment. The story follows Razak, who tries to trace Aswathi who had disappeared during while escaping torture. On the parallel, we see Aswathi running into some good and bad people, eventually culminating in a deportation. After entering into much more troubles, she reaches Razak, who was actually in a search for her. He inquires her about the complete story. He eventually helps Aswathi leave for home back in Kerala.

Iqbal wrote an article which was published in Bhashaposhini Varshika Pathippu 2010. The report was based on the abuse and mistreatments of Khaddamas (\\"housemaids\\") in Saudi Arabia and was particularly inspired by the true life incidents of a maid servant named Subaida. It was a small news item published in Malayalam News (a Malayalam daily published in the Persian Gulf area) in 2002 ‚Äî Subaida Vilikkunnu, which forms the seed of the reportage. Iqbal says he is used to getting calls from Indians in deportation camps on a daily basis, but somehow it was the call from Subaida which struck a chord in him and he followed it up. Years later the Bhashaposhini editor-in-charge, K. C. Narayanan, asked Iqbal to do an article for its anniversary edition. Iqbal narrated several of his Gulf stories to him but it was the story of Subaida which appealed to the editor. Kamal, who was inspired by the thematic significance and dramatic value of the story, immediately picked it up for his next film. He had already directed the Gulf-centric Perumazhakkalam, which depicted the story of a young man facing death penalty in the Gulf. Kamal said: \\"The series that appeared in Bhashaposhini caught my attention and I thought the theme had immense potential for a feature film. Although Malayalam cinema has handled Gulf- centric themes before, this had a unique perspective as it is centred on a woman. Our previous Gulf narratives mostly revolve around men, money and memories of homeland. This, I thought, was a marked deviation from that. Hence the decision to make it into a film\\" Kamal hired K. Girishkumar to co-write the screenplay. Girishkumar's earlier works were mostly family dramas, such as Veruthe Oru Bharya, Kana Kanmani and Amrutham. Kamal and Girishkumar have included several real-life characters and incidents as Girishkumar says: \\"Many of the incidents captured in the film are taken from real-life incidents. Only the structure of the story is fictional, the rest of it has been picked up from various individual experiences.\\" According to Kamal, more than 90 per cent of the film is captured from real life. =Casting and principal photography= The central character Aswathi is played by Kavya Madhavan. Her previous association with Kamal was in Perumazhakkalam, which won her a Kerala State Film Award for Best Actress, public appreciations and critical praise. She was also introduced to films by Kamal as a child artist in Pookkalam Varavayi and Azhakiya Ravanan. Khaddama also marks her comeback to Malayalam cinema after she took a break from films for sometime, only recently returning. The film also marks her first screen appearance after the official divorce from Nishal. According to Girishkumar, Kamal had no other choice for the protagonist of the film. He says: \\"Kavya was the first and obvious choice for the film. Even before the idea germinated into the story, she was decided as the protagonist.\\" Kavya signed the project after soon after completing Priyanandanan's Bhakthajanangalude Sradhakku. According to Kavya, it is one of the best characters she has ever got. She says: \\"I was really moved when Kamal sir narrated the story, which will be an eye-opener to many women in south India with dreams of living in the Persian Gulf. Aswathi is one of the best characters that I've ever done.\\" The other roles are played by Sreenivasan, Biju Menon, Suraj Venjaramood, Jaffer Idukki, Murali Gopy, Lena, K. P. A. C. Lalitha and Sukumari. Sreenivasan's character of a social worker (named Razak Kottekkad) has been heavily influenced by the real-life character named Shihab. Suraj Venjaramoodu, known for his comic roles, plays a negative character in the film. Several theatre artists from Indonesia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Egypt are featured in the film. Shine Tom, who plays Basheer, has also served as an assistant director for the film. The film was launched in October 2010 with its pre-shooting blessing held in Kochi, filming began on 20 October in Dubai. Almost 90% of the film was shot in Dubai and other parts of United Arab Emirates, while the remaining parts were filmed in Ottappalam, Kerala. Though the film is set in Saudi Arabia it was not filmed there. Kamal had visited several labour camps in Saudi Arabia and had gathered information from a jail personnel to know more about the life of the people there. He also spoke to many Khaddamas who returned to Kerala. Kamal argues that his research made the film more realistic and convincing. Manoj Pillai, who has been an assistant of Santosh Sivan, an independent cinematographer for a few Malayalam films was the cameraman. Manoj Pillai says: \\"The desert is a difficult terrain to work on. It was stressful, but we managed it. And the footage looks nice. It is a testimony of the fantastic crew that we add\\" The central character, Aswathi, appears in a black Pardah in major parts of the film. The costumes have been designed by Anil Kumar, while Pandiyan did the make up. Shafeer Sait, who has a longtime association with Kamal, is the production controller.\\"About me: Shafeer Sait\\" . Shafeersait.com. Retrieved 2011-02-04. Suresh Kollam is the art director. Tapas Nayak, who was an assistant of H. Sridhar, completed the sound design. =Post-production= The film retains the title of K. U. Iqbal's feature published in Bhashaposhini. \\"Khaddama\\" (often spelt \\"Gaddama\\" or \\"Gadhama\\") is a colloquial version of the Arabic word Khadima ( \\"servant\\"). The name is generally used to address domestic workers in Arabian countries who come from other countries. Most of them are from North African countries, the Philippines and Sri Lanka. Indians are comparatively few, but most are from the Malabar region. Kamal organised a special screening of the film in the first week of January. The screening was attended by several industry people including actresses Manju Warrier and Samyuktha Varma. The preview was held at D.L.S. theatre, Kakkanad, Kochi. The film received positive responses among those who attended the preview. After the show it was reported that, \\"Kavya was brilliant as the harassed Indian maid working in an Arab household\\". Release and reception The film was distributed by Murali Films. It had a limited release in about thirty theatres in Kerala on 4 February 2011. The film was anticipated among both critics and cinema-goers, not only because of its theme but also due to the wide marketing strategy. It was the only Malayalam film released on the date and hence had no significant competition. The film was to be released in the Middle East on the same day, a big market for Malayalam films, but it was banned across the Middle East as the Censor Board rejected the film. Even though the film had a limited release it to become a box office winner. The film's fiftieth day celebration was held at the Avenue Centre, Kochi on 27 March. The function was attended by film directors Joshiy and Sibi Malayil, producers Siyad Koker, Swargachitra Appachan and Vyshakh Rajan, writer P. Sukumar, and politician V. M. Sudheeran, along with the cast and crew of the film. During the function V. M. Sudheeran opined that Khaddama was one of the best films of recent times and that he had congratulated Kamal for the bold movie soon after watching it. =Critical response= The film received generally favorable critical reviews and some applauded Khaddama as a realistic film. Kavya Madhavan's lead performance has been rated as one of the best in her career. M. Ashitha of Deccan Herald said, \\"Director Kamal makes convincing depiction of the obscure fate of poor Indian women in an alien land. Kavya excels in her role. Manoj Pillai's outstanding camerawork makes the film realistic.\\" S. Anandan of The Hindu commented, \\"Kamal's movie, on its part, attempts to catalogue the society's brutality meted out to Gulf Malayalees. The movie is a decent depiction of lives in exile in the Middle East. However, going by the accounts of Gulf deportees, what is shown is just the tip of the iceberg insofar as the agonies of the diasporic workers in the Persian Gulf are concerned. Khaddama would have evoked a better response had its narrative been a little nuanced and punctuated with dark humour.\\" Paresh C. Palicha of Rediff.com gave the film three out of five stars, saying \\"Khaddama is one example where he [Kamal] deals with a subject that requires realistic treatment and he has come up on top.\\" The reviewer of Sify.com gave the film a verdict of 'Above Average' and stated, \\"Khaddama handles a different issue and it is indeed one that needs grave attention as well.\\" Nikhil Narayanan of Oneindia.in stated, \\"If you are unhappy with the lack of women-centric themes in Malayalam cinema, here's a reprieve. This movie belongs to Kavya Madhavan, who has brilliantly delivered the role portraying the hardships of a Malayalee maid in a Sheikh's house in Saudi Arabia.\\" The reviewer of Asianet said, \\"All in all, 'Khaddama' is a quality offering from the master director, with a genuine upsetting story. The movie has plenty of faces that continue to haunt you even after the film has ended. This is a film for the discerning viewer who likes to go a little beyond the regular masala stereotype.\\" =Accolades= The film has received various awards and nominations. In the 2011 Kerala Film Critics Awards it became the biggest winner, with three awards for Best Film, Best Director and Best Actress. The film was selected as one of the six Malayalam films to compete for the National Film Awards. Kavya Madhavan was in the final round in the Best Actress category, but she lost to Mitalee Jagtap Varadkar and Saranya Ponvannan. She won the Best Actress Award at the 2011 Kerala State Film Awards and Amrita-FEFKA Film Awards. Gaddhama was screened in the Malayalam Cinema Today section at the 16th International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK), in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala in 2011. ;1st South Indian International Movie Awards * Best Actress - Kavya Madhavan ; Thikkurissy Foundation Awards (2012) * Best Actress - Kavya Madhavan * Best Female Playback Singer - K.

Salim says he had written the story while he was working in the Gulf and alleges that though he had written to Kamal on the issue in the initial stages of film making itself, Kamal had not replied. \\"It became clear after I saw the film\\", he says.\\" Music and soundtrack The film's background score has been composed by M. Jayachandran, collaborating with Kamal for the first time after Perumazhakkalam. The songs are composed by the duo Bennet Veetraag and feature lyrics by noted poet Rafeeque Ahammed. The soundtrack album, released on Satyam Audios, contains five songs. Out of the five songs only two, \\"Naattuvazhiyorathe\\" and \\"Vidhuramee\\", are featured in the film as the track \\"Ariyumo\\" was a promotional song. The soundtrack received critical praise, particularly for the melody in the tracks.

The men were killed after betraying their trust with members of the gang. The Purple Gang's name rang on Detroit's streets and they also ruled the underworld. All would avoid crossing them for fear for their and their families' lives. The gang had a reputation as killers and were not afraid to keep that status. This is an example of what the gang was willing to do to keep their reputation and their territory. Background Gambling, the local wire service, drug distribution, bootlegging, certain trade unions, as well as the extortion rackets were all operated by the Purple Gang. In 1927, the Purple Gang was on top of their game running Detroit's underworld. When Three Chicago gunmen, Joseph \\"Nigger Joe\\" Lebovitz, Herman \\"Hymie\\" Paul, and Isadore \\"Izzy the Rat\\" Sutker, fled to Detroit, the Purple Gang's status was put to the test. The men shook down Chicago speakeasy operators for protection money. Unknown to them, the victims were under Al Capone's syndicate for purchasing liquor from his suppliers. After finding that out, Capone gave the men an ultimatum. They could leave Chicago willingly or in a box. Willingly, the men fled to Detroit. After arriving in the city the men soon became affiliated with a smaller faction of the Purple Gang, the \\"Little Jewish Navy.\\" They would use member owned speedboats to run liquor from Canada to Detroit. Trust would soon be lost between the men and the Purple Gang. Lebowitz, Paul, and Sutker hijacked members of the gang and preyed on other local gang members, disregarding their territories. Trying to establish themselves as an independent power, they became known as the \\"Third Avenue Terrors.\\" Trying to take over Detroit's underworld, which was controlled mainly by the Purple Gang, was going to be a hard task, which the Gang was not going to let happen easily. Massacre After failing to pay back past due debts to the Purple Gang, Ray Bernstein, one of the founders of the gang, developed a plan to kill Joseph \\"Nigger Joe\\" Lebovitz, Herman \\"Hymie\\" Paul, and Isadore \\"Izzy the Rat\\" Sutker. Bernstein would use Sol Levine as an unknown accomplice to the crime. Levine was a good friend of both groups. The plan started off by buying an apartment at the Collingwood Manor Apartments. Bernstein then convinced Levine that the Purples decided to let Lebowitz, Paul, and Sutker be their agents in the liquor business. A meeting was then set up to meet with Levine and the other men later. The meeting was called on September 16, 1931, Levine and the men met up at 1740 Collingwood Avenue. After engaging in quick conversation, Bernstein left to go start the getaway car. He waited for the sound of backfiring and honking the horn to cue the men left in the apartment to carry out the plan. Fleisher stood to his feet, pulled out a .38 caliber revolver, and shot Joseph \\"Nigger Joe\\" Lebovitz at point-blank range. Irving Milberg and Harry Keywell jumped up and began to shoot. That is not the only major massacre of Keywell, who also took part in the St. Valentine\\"s Day Massacre, along with other Purple Gang members. Keywell emptied his revolver into Isadore \\"Izzy the Rat\\" Sutker, and Milberg emptied his into Herman \\"Hymie\\" Paul. While all of that was happening, Sol Levine watched helplessly, as the men scrambled to save their lives. Aftermath After the crime, Bernstein, Keywell, Milberg and Fleisher fled the scene. One eyewitness to the whole scene was Sol Levine. The police took him into their headquarters, and after long interrogation, Levine finally confessed to seeing the murders take place and to who did it. The guns used in the crime had their serial numbers scratched off and were thrown into paint to try to rid any evidence back to the members of the Purple Gang. A ballistics test, taken shortly afterward, proved that the guns had been used in the murders of Joseph \\"Nigger Joe\\" Lebovitz, Herman \\"Hymie\\" Paul, and Isadore \\"Izzy the Rat\\" Sutker. After the confession, an anonymous call was received by the detectives office. The message stated, \\"Two of the men you want for the Collingwood Murder are at 2649 Calvert. They will be out of town within the hour.\\" Heavily armed, the police went to the location, which was owned by Charles Aurbach, an underworld consultant and Purple Gang member. Ray Bernstein and Harry Keywell were arrested in their pajamas. While preparing to skip town, Irving Milberg was arrested the following night, but Fleisher disappeared.The Purple Gang: Organized Crime in Detroit Trial The examination for the Collingwood Manor Massacre began on September 30, 1931. Sol Levine appeared at the pretrial but was frightened to testify against the men. Levine pointed to Bernstein, Keywell, and Milberg as the men who killed Joseph \\"Nigger Joe\\" Lebovitz, Herman \\"Hymie\\" Paul, and Isadore \\"Izzy the Rat\\" Sutker. He said that Harry Fleisher also took part in the shooting, but Fleisher was not present at the time. During his testimony, Levine focused solely on the prosecutor and did not once look at the accused men. In contrast, Bernstein, Keywell, and Milberg focused mainly on Levine, glaring at him during the trial. On October 2, 1931, the men were arraigned before Judge Donald Van Zile after a motion for dismissal of Levine's claim was denied. An order was issued for the men to be held without bond. Testimony for the case began on November 2, 1931. Levine began his account of what happened on the day of the massacre. Eight detectives constantly guarded him, and ten stood guard during the trial, with four on point as he testified, as he feared he would be killed during the case. Witness after witness went to the stand and testified against the gang members, claiming to have seen them run from the building after hearing gunshots. After an hour and 37 minutes, the jury returned with the verdict, finding the men guilty of the charge of first- degree murder. The members of the Purple Gang were convicted and sentenced to life in prison without parole and were sent to Marquette Prison. Chief Detectives James E. McCarty made a statement to the press: \\"This conviction is the greatest accomplishment in years. Not only does it break the back of the Purple Gang but it serves notice on other mobs that murder doesn't go anymore in Detroit.\\" It was the beginning of the end for the notorious Purple Gang. On June 9, 1932, Harry Fleisher surprised the prosecutor by strolling into the prosecutor's office with attorneys to turn himself in on the warrant for the Collingwood Manor Massacre. During the nine months that he was missing, he had been a suspect in many major crimes, including the kidnapping of Lindbergh's baby.https://archive.org/stream/LindberghBabyKidnappingFBIFiles/lindsum1c_djvu.txt By July 25, 1932, the prosecutor, Harry Toy, was forced to admit that eyewitness Solly Levine could not be found. The case against Harry Fleisher was eventually dismissed, and the judgement against Bernstein, Keywell & Milberg held. There was the option to reopen the case if new evidence was ever discovered.The Purple Gang: Organized Crime in Detroit See also *Abe Bernstein *List of Jewish American mobsters *Joseph Zerilli References * Kavieff, Paul R. \\"Collingwood Manor Massacre-The Era of Decline.\\" The Purple Gang: Organized Crime in Detroit, 1910-1945.

At the request of Judy O'Bannon, the governor's wife, the artist specifically included O'Bannon's true-to-life crooked nose and his broad smile. Historical information After O'Bannon's death in 2003, the Indiana State Legislature formed the Frank O'Bannon Memorial Commission to create a bust to honor the memory of the late governor. The committee was co-chaired by Senator James Merritt and Representative Paul Robertson. Kenneth G. Ryden was chosen from a pool of six artists to create the memorial. The choice was based on recommendations of artists from the Indiana Arts Commission and the Indiana Historical Society. The artist was paid $20,000 in private funds for the work. The bronze bust was cast at the Anderson University Art Foundry in December 2005. The completed work was unveiled in the Statehouse on February 13, 2006. In 2009, the creative process behind the making of this bust, as well as a memorial statue in O'Bannon's hometown, was featured in Indianapolis PBS station WFYI's special presentation, Cast in Bronze. =Location history= Frank O'Bannon can be found on the third floor of the Indiana Statehouse. It sits across from the entrance to the Senate chambers where Frank O'Bannon served as both state senator and Lieutenant Governor. At the recommendation of The Commission to Recommend a State House Memorial for Governor O'Bannon, this bust replaced that of Calvin Fletcher, which was moved to the fourth floor of the Indiana Statehouse. Artist Kenneth G. Ryden was born in Chicago and lives in Yorktown, Indiana. The artist works primarily in bronze, creating both abstract and figural sculptures using the lost-wax casting technique. On sculpting people, Ryden says, \\"I use the human form as a vehicle for the communication I am trying to establish.\\" Ryden has created a number of memorial statues and busts, including those honoring pitcher Carl Erskine and Martin Luther King, Jr. His work in Anderson, Indiana, includes Crucible of Peace, The Beloved, and The Graces. The artist also has done outdoor sculpture work in Springfield, Illinois, and other cities around the Midwest. =The artist and the memorial= At the time of commission, Ryden was artist-in- residence at Anderson University. Speaking of O'Bannon, the artist has said that he was impressed by the late governor's down-to-earth personality and hoped this memorial would inspire visitors to the Statehouse to learn more about O'Bannon. \\"I felt he made the high office of governor seem accessible. My big challenge is to show this in the work that I do.\\" The artist gathered many photographs and worked closely with O'Bannon's wife and daughter to achieve this. At the official unveiling ceremony, Ryden dedicated the work to the O'Bannon family and to the state.

Although both universities were founding members of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) in December 1932, the Gators and Tigers did not meet on the gridiron until 1937, and have been annual opponents only since 1971. When the SEC instituted divisional play in 1992, Florida was placed in the SEC Eastern Division and LSU in the Western Division, and Florida and LSU were selected as permanent cross-division rivals. The Gators and Tigers have combined to win five national championships and eleven SEC titles over the past two decades.  Game results  Florida leads the series 33‚Äì30‚Äì3. The longest winning streak in the series is held by Florida, with nine victories from 1988‚Äì96. LSU's longest winning streak is four, from 1977‚Äì80. The road team in the series has been unusually successful in recent years. Since the 2001 game inclusive, the home team in the series has posted a record of 9‚Äì9. Florida has won two and LSU has won three national titles during that time period and have boasted impressive home records against other opponents. Notable games =1937: First meeting= The first game in the series was a 19‚Äì0 victory for LSU at Tiger Stadium on September 25, 1937. It was the opening game of the season and played in front of a crowd of 15,000. LSU was the defending SEC champion, while Florida was coming off a 4‚Äì6 season in 1936. Both teams were coached by men who were later inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame: Bernie Moore for LSU and Josh Cody for Florida. Tigers sophomore quarterback Young Bussey provided most of the team's offense, scoring two touchdowns and kicking the only successful extra point. One of LSU's three pass completions in the game was a 40-yard strike from Bussey to future Hall of Fame end Ken Kavanaugh that put them at the Florida 2-yard line. Two other pass attempts were intercepted by Florida's Walter \\"Tiger\\" Mayberry, a star on both offense and defense. LSU out-gained Florida in rushing yards 273‚Äì51, passing yards 73‚Äì0 (Florida attempted only one pass in the game, which fell incomplete), and converted 18 first downs to Florida's 3. Retrieved October 7, 2017 ‚Äì via Newspapers.com. =1960: Wristband robbery= The Tigers were favored in 1960 in Baton Rouge. On the first play from scrimmage, Florida quarterback Larry Libertore ran for a 66-yard touchdown. Throughout the rest of the first half, Florida's offense stalled and LSU quarterback Jimmy Field effectively moved the ball, using plays from his wristband. But in the second quarter, with LSU up 10‚Äì7, the Gators sent a nine-man blitz against Field. He never saw it coming, and a sea of Gators piled on top of him. When he came out of the mass of bodies, his play-calling wristband was gone. The Gators then held Field to just 12 yards passing in the second half, with a lone first down. The Gators came back to win 13‚Äì10, Billy Cash kicking two field goals, and after the game a Gator coach gave the wristband to an official, saying one of his players had found it on the field. =1964: Hurricane delay I= During the buildup to the 1964 game in Baton Rouge, LSU was a Sugar Bowl favorite. Florida, though unranked, was led by an up-and-coming young player (and future Heisman Trophy winner) named Steve Spurrier. Then, after being delayed several weeks to the season finale due to Hurricane Hilda, the game ended up being anti-climactic with the Gators rolling to a 20‚Äì6 win over the No. 7 Tigers. Particularly noteworthy is the fact that it was Spurrier's first win over LSU ‚Äì the first of a long win streak that he would have over the Tigers as a player and head coach. =1989: College football's first \\"overtime\\" game= This game was jokingly referred to as an \\"overtime\\" game in Steve Harvey's nationally syndicated \\"Bottom Ten\\" column. After LSU hit a field goal to tie it at 13 with 1:19 left, Florida drove from their 20 to LSU's 27. Emmitt Smith was tackled at the LSU 24 inbounds with 18 seconds left. Florida scrambled to get back to the line of scrimmage to snap the ball, which they did with 3 seconds left. Kyle Morris managed to throw it out of bounds with 1 second left, but the clock still ran out, almost exactly like what happened at the end of the 2009 Big 12 Championship Game between #3 Texas and #22 Nebraska. Fireworks were set off over Tiger Stadium in celebration for holding off a late Gator comeback, even though it was right as Florida was sending its special teams unit onto the field. The second was added back to the clock, allowing Arden Czyzewski to attempt, and hit, a 41-yard field goal as time expired to win it 16‚Äì13. The unexpected setback sent LSU into a losing streak and its first losing season since they went 4‚Äì7 as well in 1983. The manner in which LSU lost the game helped push them into the top spot of that week's Bottom Ten. =1997: LSU's revenge= The previous season, the Gators won the national championship and thrashed LSU 56‚Äì13, and they came into the game favored. But it was LSU who jumped out to a big early lead, scoring two touchdowns in the first 8 minutes on runs by Herb Tyler and Tommy Banks. The Gators came right back with two touchdown runs by Fred Taylor, each of which capped off an 80-yard drive. Then, Doug Johnson threw an ill-advised pass, and Cedric Donaldson picked it off and returned it for a touchdown to give LSU a 21‚Äì14 lead. The Gators' frustration mounted when another Johnson pass was picked off, this time by Mark Roman, and when Herb Tyler scored another touchdown to give LSU a 28‚Äì14 lead with 11:40 to go, the Gators appeared to be in big trouble. Undaunted, Johnson responded with a 13-play, 78-yard drive that ended with Fred Taylor getting into the end zone to make it 28‚Äì21. LSU did nothing with their next possession, and Doug Johnson began moving the ball downfield again. He then faced a rush on a third and two and threw up a Hail Mary which was intercepted by Raion Hill. The Tigers held on for the 28‚Äì21 upset. Kevin Faulk appeared on the next week's cover of Sports Illustrated. =2003: LSU's only loss = The beleaguered Gators, under second year coach Ron Zook, took on #6 LSU and Nick Saban with freshman Chris Leak making his third start at quarterback for Florida. The Gators were off to their worst start since 1979, with a 3‚Äì3 record to begin the year. The previous week, Florida lost to Ole Miss at home and Coach Ron Zook was already on the hot seat. However, Florida's freshman quarterback Chris Leak would help the Gators turn their season around. Leak shrugged off six sacks, the Tiger Stadium noise and a pressing defense to lead the Gators to a 19‚Äì7 victory over LSU with two separate touchdown passes to running backs Ran Carthon and Ciatrick Fason out of the backfield. Florida also got a massive game out of their defense, including cornerback Keiwan Ratliff, who had two interceptions and shut LSU down. This shocking loss in Death Valley would be the Tigers' only defeat of the season, as Nick Saban would go on to win his first BCS National Championship and his only title with LSU. =2006: Tebow's series debut= The 9th ranked Tigers visited the 5th ranked Gators favored by a point and a half. Early in the first quarter, JaMarcus Russell connected with Jacob Hester for a touchdown. However, Florida's freshman quarterback Tim Tebow would help the Gators turn the tide. While the Gators' starting QB was senior Chris Leak, coach Urban Meyer had been rotating Tebow, a highly touted recruit, into the huddle for a few series every game. Tebow made the most of his opportunities against LSU, accounting for three touchdowns, including his first career passing touchdown on \\"the jump pass\\" to tight end Tate Casey. The Gators won 23‚Äì10 and went on to win the BCS National Championship. =2007: 5-for-5 on 4th down= The 9th-ranked Gators traveled to Baton Rouge to take on the top-ranked Tigers. Early on, it appeared that Florida was heading for a big win when they raced out to a 10‚Äì0 lead. The two teams then traded scores, scoring two touchdowns each to make it 24‚Äì14 late in the third quarter. LSU rallied behind Matt Flynn to score a touchdown to cut it to 24‚Äì21. Then they stopped Tebow and got the ball back with just a few minutes left. They faced a fourth and two in their own territory, and got the first down. Not even a minute later, they faced another fourth and two and again converted. From the Florida 12-yard line, once again, the Tigers faced a fourth and 1. But rather than kick the game-tying field goal, Les Miles ordered a dive play. And for the fifth time in the game, the Tigers converted. Soon after, LSU took the lead when running back Jacob Hester bulled across the end zone with 1:09 left and LSU hung on, 28‚Äì24. The Tigers, though they would finish the season with two losses, went on to win the BCS National Championship. =2010: The fake field goal= In a back-and-forth game, LSU pulled ahead 26‚Äì14 early in the 4th quarter. But Andre Debose answered with a kickoff return for a touchdown, and following a defensive stand by the Gators, Florida got the ball with 7 minutes left and trailing 26‚Äì21. A long drive ended when running back Mike Gillislee ran into the end zone with three minutes left. Quarterback John Brantley completed the two- point conversion to Omarious Hines to increase the Gator lead to 29‚Äì26 with just under 3 minutes left. LSU's Jarrett Lee then led a drive that found LSU at the Gator 36-yard line with 34 seconds to go. LSU coach Les Miles ordered a 53-yard field goal attempt by Josh Jasper. Holder Derek Helton blindly pitched the ball over his head on a fake field goal. It hit the ground, but took a perfect bounce right into the arms of Jasper, who picked it up and crossed the first down line. Lee then threw a 28-yard pass to Terrence Toliver to the Florida 3-yard line with 18 seconds left. After spiking the ball, then an incomplete pass, Lee tossed the game winner to Toliver with 6 seconds left; LSU won 33‚Äì29. =2016: Hurricane delay II= This game was originally scheduled to be played in Gainesville on October 8, but due to Hurricane Matthew, the game was canceled. After much deliberation between Florida Athletic Director Jeremy Foley, LSU Athletic Director Joe Alleva and SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey, both schools agreed to play the game on November 19 in Baton Rouge, with Florida hosting the 2017 (originally scheduled to play in Baton Rouge) and 2018 matchups in Gainesville. The first half was a defensive battle, with LSU leading 7‚Äì3. The Tigers drove the ball inside the Florida 5-yard line to start the second half but came away with zero points after a fumbled snap on a short field goal attempt resulted in a desperation throw by the holder that fell incomplete in the endzone. The Gators immediately took advantage of that LSU miscue on the very next play by scoring a 98-yard touchdown pass on first down from graduate transfer quarterback Austin Appleby to freshman receiver Tyrie Cleveland, who shook off an LSU defender while speeding to the endzone to take a 10‚Äì7 lead. After an exchange of punts, LSU scored a field goal to tie the game at 10. Florida kicker Eddy Pineiro then made a pair of field goals to give the Gators a 16‚Äì10 lead late in the fourth quarter, the second field goal being set up by an LSU lost fumble on a kickoff return. After driving down the field with less than a minute left, LSU had first-and-goal at UF's 6‚Äìyard line with :38 left. The Tigers picked up 5 yards on the first two plays, both handoffs to running back Derrius Guice but were stuffed at the 1-yard line on third-and-goal on a full back handoff. With its final timeout, LSU stopped the clock with :03 remaining in the game. On the final play of the game, LSU lined up in the goal-line formation. From the snap, the play looked broken, with transfer quarterback Danny Etling spinning to the right on what appeared to be a handoff. However, running back Derrius Guice was late off of the snap, forcing Etling to pitch the ball backwards to the 6-yard line. Guice attempted to find a hole, starting to run right but cutting back left and diving through the air from the two yard line, but was met by Gators defensive back Marcell Harris and defensive linemen Cece Jefferson and Jordan Sherit, who wrapped up his legs, stopping him at the goal line. While coming down, Guice fumbled the ball but it was recovered by Gators cornerback Quincy Wilson at the half yard line. Florida players and staff stormed the field in celebration after pulling off what would be considered the biggest upset of its season. Linebacker Rayshad Jackson and wide receiver Antonio Callaway celebrated by running through the end zone with a Florida Gators flag in hand. Florida head coach Jim McElwain became the first coach in conference history to lead his team to the conference championship game in his first two seasons.

Along the east coast is a complex of Palaezoic to Cainozoic rocks while much of the rest of the state is covered by Cretaceous and Cainozoic rocks. A Precambrian basement is found in the north west and Cape York regions. The Thomson Orogen occurs in the central and southern parts of Queensland, but is mostly covered by younger basins. The North Queensland Orogen is along the coast from Charters Towers to Princess Charlotte Bay. The Bowen Gunndedah Sydney basin can be considered as one system that extends into Queensland. The New England Orogen is on the coastal parts from the border with New South Wales north to Ayr. Devonian The Drummond Basin is a geological basin in central and northern Queensland which consists of Late Devonian to early Carboniferous shallow-marine and continental sediments. Precambrian The Precambrian basement in Queensland is west of the Tasman Line. It includes elements such as the Mount Isa Orogen and the Georgetown Inlier. The Mount Isa Orogen started with sediments, volcanics and intrusive rocks, and was deformed and metamorphosed during the Barramundi Orogeny 1870 Mya. Sedimentary layers formed on top, firstly felsic volcanic rocks from 1870 to 1850 Mya. Shallow water sediments formed from 1790 to 1705 Mya. Fine grained sediments and carbonate rocks formed from 1675 to 1590. Then this was folded in the Isan Orogeny 1620 to 1520 Mya, overlapping with sedimentation. At 1620 Mya the compressive force was north-south, but this changed to east-west at 1520 Mya The Kalkadoon Botholith and Ewn intruded the central Kalkadoon-Ewen Province between 180 and 1850 Mya. The Sybella Batholith intruded the Western Fold Belt around 1670 Mya. Other batholiths are the Wonga, Williams, Naraku ranging from 1750 to 1490 Mya. The Murphy Province crosses over into the Northern Territory, consisting of the Murphy Metamorphics, the Nicholson Granite and Cliffdale Volcanics. It is from 1820 to 1730 Mya. North of the Murphy Province is the McArthur Basin, also crossing the Northern Territory border. It consists of the Tawallah Group of sediments and volcanics from 1725 Mya and the McArthur Group tuff at 1740 Mya. The South Nicholson Basin is a basin straddling the Queensland-Northern Territory border, south of the above provinces. The Savannah Province on Cape York initially formed around 1585 to 1550 Mya as sediments, but are now converted to slate, phyllite, schist, gneiss and quartzite. They were intruded bydolerite and amphibolite. The Etheridge Province lies to the east. It started as a rift in the continent, between 1700 and 1650 Mya. This was deformed and intruded with granite and metamorphosed at 1550 Mya. The Croydon Province contains the Croydon Volcanic Group of acid volcanids, the Esmeralda Supersuite granite, and quartz rich sediments of the Inorunie Group. Cretaceous The relatively shallow Eromanga Sea was an inland sea that covered large parts of Queensland and Central Australia at least four times during the early Cretaceous. The Winton Formation represent remnants of the river plains that filled the basin left by the Eromanga Sea. The formation is a major source of dinosaur fossils. The Toolebuc Formation which contains strata dating back to the early Cretaceous and is partly located in Queensland and the Northern Territory. Bowen- Gunnedah-Sydney Basin System Stretching of the continental crust of the New England Orogen in the Permian period formed the Bowen-Gunnedah-Sydney Basin System. This was a foreland basin from Permian into the Triassic. Granites from this time also intruded. From middle to Late Triassic an ocean arc collided. This folded and trusted the surface contents of the basin starting in the east extending to the west. North Queensland Orogen The North Queensland Orogen is also denotated by the North Lachlan Orogen. The northernmost part is called the Hodgekinson Fold Belt. =North Queensland Highlands= The North Queensland Highlands is a physiographic region in northern Queensland. It includes the Chillagoe Belt, Normanby Platform, Atherton Tableland, Mount Emu Lava Plains and the Cairns Littoral. Basins =Bowen= The Bowen Basin is partly overlaid by the Surat Basin. The basin contains the largest coal reserves in Australia. Open cut and underground coal mines are located in the north of the basin. Ports at Hay Point, Queensland and Gladstone provide access for coal to export markets. In the Denison Trough in the west of the basin contraction has generated a range of geometries. =Clarence-Moreton = The Jurassic to Cretaceous Clarence Moreton Basin is found in South East Queensland across the border to New South Wales. =Eromanga = The Eromanga and Surat Basins are superimposed on the older rocks of the Lachlan Orogen. They are components of the Great Artesian Basin. Beneath the Eromanga basin in the mantle below 200 km is a region of fast seismic wave transmission. The Surat Basin is made up of Jurassic through to Cretaceous aged sediments derived from Triassic and Permian arc rocks of the Hunter-Bowen orogeny. =Galilee= The Galilee Basin is a permian geological basin in the western Queensland region of Australia. =Cooper= The Cooper Basin is located in South West Queensland and is partly overlain by the Eromanga Basin. It contains some most important on-shore petroleum and natural gas deposits in Australia. Government Architectural drawing of the Geological Survey Office and Museum, Townsville, c 1887 The Queensland Government appointed its first geologist Christopher D'Oyly Hale Aplin on 1 April 1868, and the second one Richard Daintree on 12 May 1868 to explore the northern regions. Their job was to look for gold. The jobs only lasted for one to two years as the parliament cut off funding for the Geological Survey. Daintree produced the first geological map of Queensland in 1872. In 1875 Augustus Charles Gregory was appointed as the geologist for the southern part of Queensland, and Robert Logan Jack started work in 1877 in Townsville. The focus extended beyond gold to coal as well. In 1892 the Geological Survey moved from Townsville to Brisbane, establishing a museum. In 1893 the office was flooded and it moved to the intersection of George and Queen Streets. Mining Mary Kathleen, 2011 Queensland has significant coal, coal seam gas and bauxite deposits and some oil shale and natural gas reserves. Other minerals mined in the state include copper, lead, silver, zinc, gold, phosphate rock, magnesite and silica sand. Gemstones such as sapphire, opal and chrysoprase are also mined in commercial quantities. Opal fields extend from the Koroit opal field in South West Queensland into New South Wales. Fossils Significant fossil finds have been discovered at Riversleigh and Murgon fossil site.

Milner Library is the flagship branch of the Edmonton Public Library. It is located on the southern side of Sir Winston Churchill Square in downtown Edmonton, near City Hall, Edmonton City Centre mall, the Francis Winspear Centre for Music, and the Citadel Theatre. In January 2017, the library closed its doors for a major renovation, as all but the basic structure was be removed to be rebuilt with an architectural design similar to that of the Art Gallery of Alberta located a few blocks away. Its services were relocated to a temporary space on Jasper Avenue in Enterprise Square. The new Stanley A. Milner Library, along with the new Shelley Milner Children's Library opened on September 17th 2020 The building is directly connected to the underground pedway network and to Edmonton's LRT. A number of ETS bus routes also serve the library along Harbin Road (102 Avenue) and 100 Street. Underground parking, run by the city, is also available. The Stanley A. Milner Library is also a centre for assistive services. Specialized magnifiers, projection reading rooms, large print books, braille material, voice dictation stations, and specialized computers are available as part of the library's mission to provide information access to all. History Stanley A. Milner Library in 1989 The Stanley A. Milner Library was opened in 1967 on the southern edge of Churchill Square. The site of the library was originally home to Market Square, Edmonton's main square and city market from 1900 to 1965. Although the square and market were considered a hub of Edmonton's community, the city wished to create a more dedicated civic centre.Merrett, 117 The city had already built and relocated city hall to its current location in 1956 and, in conjunction with the new art gallery completed in 1969, the library was designed to form part of this new centre. The library replaced the original downtown library, which was located two blocks south on Macdonald Drive. The original downtown library was funded by a donation from Andrew Carnegie and completed in 1923 (a temporary downtown library had existed prior to this). The building was small though, and the city's growth boom in the post-WWII years fueled demand for a larger building. The new building was designed in the Brutalist style, common for many public buildings constructed in Edmonton in the 1960s, and would cost approximately CA$4-million. It features a cantilevered second level above a smaller lower level, exposed concreted, plate glass window walls, podium pillars, and a four-story tower atop it. It opened on May 27, 1967, and was originally named the \\"Centennial Library\\" in honour of the Canadian Centennial that year. The small public square on the south side of the library building was also named \\"Centennial Square\\". The original downtown library was sold and demolished in 1968, to make room for the Alberta Government Telephones Tower (today Telus Plaza). Direct connection to Edmonton's underground pedway system was added in 1978 when construction was completed on the original LRT line downtown. The library is connected to Churchill LRT Station, and can also reach most of the nearby arts and civic centre buildings through the pedway. In 1996 the library was officially renamed the \\"Stanley A. Milner Library,\\" in honour of petroleum business leader, philanthropist, former city councilor, and former Library Board Chairman Dr. Stanley A. Milner. The first major renovation project to the library was completed in 1998, which saw the addition of a new front entrance facing Churchill Square, along with many interior upgrades. In 2010, the newly renovated children's library was reopened and named in honour of Dr. Milner's late daughter, Shelley Milner. The Stanley A. Milner Library had a number of meeting rooms and a small theater in the lower level, that were used for library programs and would also be rented out by the public. The library temporarily closed in January 2017 for major revitalization of the building.The building reopened on September 17 2020. Future The Stanley A. Milner Library in 2017 The Stanley A. Milner Library is the largest and one of the busiest Edmonton Public Library locations. It was still very up to date with assistive services, accessibility, and information technologies. However, The building was now over 50 years old and was beginning to show its age. As is common with many of Edmonton's Brutalist buildings of the era, the exposed concrete and other materials in the library were beginning to fail from years of weathering. Aging mechanical system designs have also led to ventilation concerns and wasted energy costs. In addition, there have been safety concerns regarding the front entrance of the library facing Churchill Square. The narrow sidewalk and busy bus stop just outside the entrance on 102 Avenue, has led to many congestion and safety problems. The library's renovation and expansion in 2018 In response to these concerns, the increasing cost and inefficiencies of the aging building, and a general misfit with the other, now more modern buildings in the civic and arts area, the city commissioned the architectural firm of Manasc Isaac to look into a \\"re-imagination\\" of the current building. The proposal would involve removal and replacement of the exterior walls, a new front entrance, and revamped interior with updated mechanical systems. The primary structure and layout of the building, however, would not be changed. This would provide significant cost-savings in comparison to completely replacing the building, while still transforming it into a modern, energy efficient space. Construction started in January 2017, and the library was expected to reopen on February 14, 2020; however, this target was not met. The library already has access to the two lines on the LRT system from Churchill station, and the Valley Line, scheduled to be completed in 2021, will run past the library on 102 Avenue. The library officially opened on September 17, 2020. Future developments at the newly reopened Milner Branch include a Second Cup location, a renewed Muttart Theatre and the EPL Kitchen, a 2,100 square foot culinary centre that will provide creative and educational opportunities relating to health, nutrition and food literacy.

Early life and education Born in Nuremberg to a hops merchant and a professional singer, he studied at the Conservatory at the Nuremberg Gymnasium but also took an interest in medicine. Trying to determine which path to take, after an indifferent reception from Richard Strauss and being inspired by Arrowsmith, he went into medicine, earning a degree at the University of Munich in 1934. His family--who were Jewish--left Nazi Germany shortly thereafter, and he studied further at the University of Bern, and was awarded another medical degree in 1935. Career as cardiologist Bing then took a fellowship in Copenhagen at the Carlsberg Biological Institute. There he was visited by the Nobel prize-winning surgeon Alexis Carrel and aviator Charles Lindbergh. From that meeting came an invitation to work at the Rockefeller Institute in New York on the early development of machine perfusion. Following his work at the Rockefeller Institute, he took a position in physiology at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, where he worked under Allen Whipple. He took an assistant residency at Johns Hopkins University in order to allow him to join the Medical Corps. After two years in the Corps, he returned to Hopkins as a junior faculty member. There, he did pioneering research into cardiac metabolism, enabling the accurate measurement of the effects of drugs and drug candidates on the heart. After stints at Washington University and Wayne State University, he moved to California, and joined the Huntington Medical Research Institutes. There, he continued research, studying the chemistry of heart attacks, developing techniques for high-speed photography of the coronary vessels, and measurement of blood flow using nitric oxide. Bing was life president of the International Society for Heart Research, having helped establish the group that evolved into that organization. He continued work into his 90s, and published more than 500 academic papers and books. Continuing his interest in music, he also wrote 300 works of music and five works of fiction. Personal life/death Bing married Mary Whipple, the daughter of his supervisor at Columbia, in 1938 (died in 1990), and had two sons and two daughters; His daughter Barbara Bing died in 1999.

Indian Basket Trick (or Hindu Basket Trick) is a trick with a wicker basket in which an assistant is put into the basket and the performer then puts swords through it. The trick ends while the child or assistant either climbs out of the basket or reappears from behind the crowd unharmed. The Indian Basket trick has been used in an adapted form by Western magicians for a long time. It is one of the oldest illusions. It started off being performed in the streets; later, Colonel Stodare adapted it to stage magic. In the old version of the Indian Basket Trick, the magician used a real basket for the trick. Nowadays magicians use a box to accomplish this trick. The secret to the trick was revealed by the magician Samri Baldwin as early as 1895. Baldwin described the trick as a very simple illusion. The boy whilst inside the basket \\"coils himself around in the bulge or protruding sides of the basket, so that when the Fakeer tramples in the middle or center, he does not trample on the boy... The sword is only put through the basket at certain prearranged places and passes between the boy's legs, between his arms and the body, between the shoulders and the body, or between the shoulders and the neck.\\" As for the boy reappearing outside of the basket behind the crowd, it is not the same boy but a confederate.Baldwin, Samuel.

He was a member of the United Church of Canada and a freemason. He has owned several businesses in Peterborough, including a car dealership and a property development company. He and his wife Marjorie raised three daughters. Politics Brown was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1959 general election, winning by a significant margin in Peterborough. He was re-elected in 1963. He did not run in 1967 citing business pressure. The Progressive Conservatives held a majority government in the legislature throughout this period, and Brown served as a backbench supporter of the Leslie Frost and John Robarts administrations. Brown served as Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House (i.e., Deputy Speaker) for a period in the 1960s. On one occasion, he was the target of a motion of non-confidence by the opposition. He was later the campaign manager for Sam Murphy in the 1967 election. Murphy was defeated by New Democratic Party candidate Walter Pitman. During the 1967 election, a controversy arose over property that Brown had purchased for $85,000 in 1964 and sold for $210,000 in early 1967. The Ontario Housing Corporation (OHC) expressed interest in the land shortly thereafter, and some reports suggested the possibility of an improper relationship between Brown, the subsequent landowners, and the OHC. Brown dismissed this, saying that he was uninvolved in the OHC proposal and that in light of later developments his selling price had been too low. Trade and Development Minister Stanley Randall later confirmed that Brown had not been involved in the OHC's discussions and described the accusations against him as \\"wholly unreasonable and completely unwarranted.\\" Later life Brown's automobile firm gave financial support to Chris Stockwell in his bid to succeed Mike Harris as leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario in the party's 2002 leadership election.

History Trout Creek was an important fall camp for the Washo people who caught Mountain whitefish (Prosopium williamsoni, formerly Coregonus williamsoni (Girard, 1856)) there. The Washo name Mathocahuw O'tha means \\"river of the whitefish\\". George and Adeline Fountain built a log cabin near the headwaters in 1860 and the area is referred to as \\"Fountain Place\\". Watershed Trout Creek originates south of Freel Peak in the Carson Range of the Sierra Nevada. It is joined by Saxon Creek in Lake Valley, then meets Cold Creek at Lake Christopher which was created by damming the creek, then after being joined by Heavenly Valley Creek, it enters Truckee Marsh and south Lake Tahoe. The fourth main tributary is Hidden Valley Creek. The only lake in the Trout Creek watershed is Star Lake. Trout Creek has a drainage area of 106 square kilometers, and the main channel length is approximately 19.5 km long. The Cold Creek sub-basin drains a watershed area of and originates at at Freel Peak. Ecology The Trout Creek Stream Restoration and Wildlife Enhancement Project in South Lake Tahoe was completed in 2001. Over 3000 m of channel were reconstructed with enhanced sinuosity, a raised channel elevation, reduced slope, and an overall increase in channel length. The purpose was to improve stream habitat, raise the water table and to allow for increased hydrologic connectivity between the stream channel and the floodplain. Trout Creek is being studied by the U. S. Forest Service for the effectiveness of the stream restoration effectiveness, particularly total and fine sediment load reductions with a final report due in 2012. North American beaver (Castor canadensis) inhabit multiple reaches of Trout Creek and Cold Creek. Beaver were re-introduced to the Tahoe Basin by the CDFG and the U. S. Forest Service between 1934 and 1949 in order to prevent stream degradation and to promote wetland restoration. The presence of beaver dams has also been shown to either increase the number of fish, their size, or both, in a study of brook, rainbow and brown trout in Sagehen Creek, which flows into the Little Truckee River at an altitude of and is a stream typical of the eastern slope of the northern Sierra Nevada. Not only have aspen and cottonwood survived ongoing beaver colonization but a recent study of ten Tahoe streams, including Trout Creek and Cold Creek, utilizing aerial multispectral videography has shown that deciduous, thick herbaceous, and thin herbaceous vegetation are more highly concentrated near beaver dams, whereas coniferous trees are decreased. Benefits of beaver dams include removal of sediment and excessive pollutants travelling downstream, which improves lake clarity, which was shown to worsen recently when beaver dams were removed in nearby Taylor Creek and Ward Creek.

An annotation (irrespective of the context) is a note added by way of explanation or commentary. Once a genome is sequenced, it needs to be annotated to make sense of it. For DNA annotation, a previously unknown sequence representation of genetic material is enriched with information relating genomic position to intron-exon boundaries, regulatory sequences, repeats, gene names and protein products. This annotation is stored in genomic databases such as Mouse Genome Informatics, FlyBase, and WormBase. Educational materials on some aspects of biological annotation from the 2006 Gene Ontology annotation camp and similar events are available at the Gene Ontology website. The National Center for Biomedical Ontology (www.bioontology.org) develops tools for automated annotationhttp://bioontology.stanford.edu/annotator-service of database records based on the textual descriptions of those records. As a general method, dcGO has an automated procedure for statistically inferring associations between ontology terms and protein domains or combinations of domains from the existing gene/protein-level annotations. Process Genome annotation consists of three main steps:. # identifying portions of the genome that do not code for proteins # identifying elements on the genome, a process called gene prediction # attaching biological information to these elements Automatic annotation tools attempt to perform these steps via computer analysis, as opposed to manual annotation (a.k.a. curation) which involves human expertise. Ideally, these approaches co-exist and complement each other in the same annotation pipeline. A simple method of gene annotation relies on homology based search tools, like BLAST, to search for homologous genes in specific databases, the resulting information is then used to annotate genes and genomes. However, as information is added to the annotation platform, manual annotators become capable of deconvoluting discrepancies between genes that are given the same annotation. Some databases use genome context information, similarity scores, experimental data, and integrations of other resources to provide genome annotations through their Subsystems approach. Other databases (e.g. Ensembl) rely on curated data sources as well as a range of different software tools in their automated genome annotation pipeline. Structural annotation consists of the identification of genomic elements. * ORFs and their localization * gene structure * coding regions * location of regulatory motifs Functional annotation consists of attaching biological information to genomic elements. * biochemical function * biological function * involved regulation and interactions * expression These steps may involve both biological experiments and in silico analysis. Proteogenomics based approaches utilize information from expressed proteins, often derived from mass spectrometry, to improve genomics annotations. A variety of software tools have been developed to permit scientists to view and share genome annotations; for example, MAKER. Genome annotation remains a major challenge for scientists investigating the human genome, now that the genome sequences of more than a thousand human individuals (The 100,000 Genomes Project, UK) and several model organisms are largely complete. Identifying the locations of genes and other genetic control elements is often described as defining the biological \\"parts list\\" for the assembly and normal operation of an organism. Scientists are still at an early stage in the process of delineating this parts list and in understanding how all the parts \\"fit together\\". Genome annotation is an active area of investigation and involves a number of different organizations in the life science community which publish the results of their efforts in publicly available biological databases accessible via the web and other electronic means. Here is an alphabetical listing of on- going projects relevant to genome annotation: * Encyclopedia of DNA elements (ENCODE) * Entrez Gene * Ensembl * GENCODE * Gene Ontology Consortium * GeneRIF * RefSeq * Uniprot * Vertebrate and Genome Annotation Project (Vega) At Wikipedia, genome annotation has started to become automated under the auspices of the Gene Wiki portal which operates a bot that harvests gene data from research databases and creates gene stubs on that basis.

It is found in the eastern Atlantic of Europe and Africa as well as the Mediterranean, and is of minor interest to fisheries. Description The Mediterranean scaldfish is a small flatfish with a slender oval body, a small head with large eyes placed on the left side of the head. It has an oblique mouth which is moderately sized. The dorsal fin has its origin in front of its upper eye, the first dozen or so dorsal fin rays are partially fee from the fin membrane, although they are not elongated. The pelvic fin on the eyed side has a long bas and is larger than its equivalent on its blind side. It has 87-93 rays in its dorsal fin and 65-74 rays in the anal fin. Its scales are thin and fragile and there are usually very few on its body. It is pale brownish grey in colour with dark spots on its body and fins, with a dusky spot on the pelvic fins. The lateral line has 50-56 scales. It is a sexually dimorphic species in which the males are distinguished by having an unusual appearance with of certain fin rays being elongated. This species grows up to 25 cm in total length. Distribution The Mediterranean scaldfish has a wide distribution which extends from Trondheim in the north southwards along the eastern Atlantic Ocean to Angola. It also extends into the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea, as well as Madeira. Habitat and biology The Mediterranean scaldfish is found on the upper part of the continental shelf where it has a benthic habit on mixed or muddy substrates down to about 200m and feeds on small fishes and invertebrates. Their breeding season is from May to August. It metamorphoses into an adult from a larva when it is between 16mm and 23mm in length and off the coast of Brittany it may live for up to eight years. Fisheries The Mediterranean scaldfish is of minor commercial importance and the catch tends to be sold in local markets. In the northeastern Mediterraean it is normally discarded from bottom trawl catches. It is caught in commercial trawlers as by-catch in the eastern central Atlantic but again it is usually discarded. Some of this by-catch by industrial fisheries is utilized by artisanal fisheries and is consumed in fresh or dried form.

He is chiefly remembered for his friendship with Jonathan Swift. Family and early career He was born in Cavan, Ireland, the son of James Sheridan, and grandson of the Reverend Dennis Sheridan. Two of his uncles were William Sheridan, Bishop of Kilmore and Ardagh and Patrick Sheridan, Cloyne, the Bishop of Cloyne. After graduating from Trinity College, Dublin, he married Elizabeth MacFadden and the couple first lived in Dublin in King James's Mint. He inherited from his father-in- law a substantial property at Quilca in County Cavan. He ran a school in Capel Street, Dublin in the 1720s, whose pupils included children of many prominent families such as Anthony Foster, the future Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer, and Philip Tisdall, the future Attorney General for Ireland. He was the father of Thomas Sheridan, a celebrated actor and elocutionist, who was in his turn the father of the celebrated playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan; he had two other sons and one daughter. In 1725 he was appointed a royal chaplain, but preached a sermon which was considered by some to be politically suspect, and his appointment was cancelled. In compensation he was given a living at Drumlane in Cavan and in 1735 became headmaster of the Cavan Royal School where he remained for three years. Other appointments he is reputed to have applied for were the position of Dean of Kilmore and the position of headmaster of the Royal School in Armagh, but neither was successful. Friendship with Swift He was friends with Jonathan Swift, and had a room permanently reserved for him in the Deanery; he was his principal collaborator and wrote his biography. Swift often stayed at Sheridan's country house and wrote part of Gulliver's Travels there On the much debated question of whether Swift was secretly married to Esther Johnson (\\"Stella\\"), Sheridan was a strong if not conclusive witness that the marriage did take place; according to friends his source was Stella herself. Like so many of Swift's friends, he was ultimately fated to quarrel with him irrevocably: in 1738 Swift told him that he was no longer welcome at the Deanery. Apart from Swift's increasing eccentricity, the cause of the quarrel is obscure: by one account Sheridan rebuked Swift for his growing avarice, which Swift thought unforgivable. Death and reputation Sheridan collapsed and died suddenly while having dinner at a friend's house in Rathfarnham, County Dublin.DNB entry Swift before their final quarrel called him the best scholar in Ireland; Sir Walter Scott in his Life of Swift calls him \\"good- natured and light- hearted.\\" References Category:1687 births Category:1738 deaths Category:17th-century Irish poets Category:18th-century Irish poets Category:18th-century male writers Category:People from County Cavan Category:Irish essayists Category:18th-century Irish dramatists and playwrights Category:Irish male poets Category:Irish male dramatists and playwrights Category:Irish educators Category:Irish Christian theologians Category:Irish translators ","title":"Thomas Sheridan (divine)"},{"id":"29591325","text":"Tethya is a genus of sea sponges belonging to the family Tethyidae.http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=132077 accessed 15 April 2019 Members of this genus all have a spherical body formBranch, G.M., Branch, M.L, Griffiths, C.L. and Beckley, L.E. 2010.
