It includes the highlands of Sulawesi. Geography Sulawesi, with an area of 180,681 km¬≤, is the fourth-largest island in Indonesia, and the eleventh-largest in the world. The landmass of Sulawesi includes four peninsulas: the northern Minahasa Peninsula, the East Peninsula, the South Peninsula, and the Southeast Peninsula. The island is mountainous, and the highest peak is Mount Latimojong at 3,478 meters. Approximately 40% of Sulawesi's land area is in the montane rain forests ecoregion; the surrounding lowlands are in the Sulawesi lowland rain forests ecoregion. The islands that make up the ecoregion are part of Wallacea, a group of islands that are part of the Australasian realm, but were never joined to either the Australian or Asian continents. The islands of Wallacea are home to a mix of plants and animals from both terrestrial realms, and have many unique species that evolved in isolation.Wikramanayake, Eric; Eric Dinerstein; Colby J. Loucks; et al. (2002). Terrestrial Ecoregions of the Indo-Pacific: a Conservation Assessment. Washington, DC: Island Press. The Makassar Strait separates Sulawesi from Borneo to the west; the strait is part of the Wallace Line, which demarcates the western boundary of Wallacea. Borneo and the other Indonesian islands west of Sulawesi are part of Sundaland, and were connected to the Asian continent when sea levels were lower during the ice ages. Climate The ecoregion has a wet tropical montane climate. Flora The main plant communities are lower montane rain forest, upper montane rain forest, and sub-alpine forests. The forests generally form a closed canopy, and height decreases with elevation. Lower montane rain forest, or sub-montane forest, ranges from 1000 to 1500 meters elevation. Trees in the beech family (Fagaceae) are predominant, including four species of Lithocarpus and two species of Castanopsis (Castanopsis acuminatissima and C. buruana). Other trees include Eugenia, along with trees in the myrtle family (Myrtaceae), laurel family (Lauraceae), and tea family (Theaceae) and the conifers Agathis dammara and Phyllocladus. Epiphytes including orchids are common. In the mid- montane forests (1500-2000 meters elevation) Fagaceae, especially Lithocarpus menadoensis and L. celebicus, Myrtaceae, and Agathis are predominant.Culmsee, H., Pitopang, R., Mangopo, H. et al.

Biodivers Conserv 20, 1103‚Äì1123 (2011). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-011-0019-y Upper montane forests are characterized by conifers, including species of Agathis, Podocarpus, Dacrycarpus, Dacrydium, and Phyllocladus, together with Myrtaceae and the shrubs Rhododendron, Vaccinium, Gaultheria, and Tasmannia piperita. Fagaceae are less common than in the lower-elevation forests. Mosses become abundant over 2000 meters elevation.Culmsee, H., Pitopang, R., Mangopo, H. et al.

Sub- alpine communities form above 3200 meters elevation, with low trees and shrubs, principally Rhododendron, Decaspermum, and Hedyotis, along with the lower shrubs Gaultheria and Styphelia suaveolens. The trees and shrubs are festooned with lichens. Herbs include the daisy Keysseria, the ginger Alpinia, Potentilla leuconata and P. parvus, and the grasses Poa and Agrostis.Wikramanayake, Eric; Eric Dinerstein; Colby J. Loucks; et al. (2002). Terrestrial Ecoregions of the Indo-Pacific: a Conservation Assessment. Washington, DC: Island Press.Tony Whitten, Greg S. Henderson (2012) Ecology of Sulawesi. Tuttle Publishing, Jun 19, 2012. Fauna The ecoregion is home to 102 mammal species, a third of which are endemic or near-endemic. 24 mammal species are endemic to the ecoregion, and 10 are near-endemic.Wikramanayake, Eric; Eric Dinerstein; Colby J. Loucks; et al. (2002). Terrestrial Ecoregions of the Indo-Pacific: a Conservation Assessment. Washington, DC: Island Press. Larger mammals include two pigs, the Celebes warty pig (Sus celebensis) and North Sulawesi babirusa (Babyrousa celebensis). The Celebes warty pig lives in the lower montane and lowland rain forests of Sulawesi and other islands of Wallacea. The North Sulawesi babirusa lives in both the montane and lowland rain forests of northern and central Sulawesi. The endemic Mountain anoa (Bubalus quarlesi) is a dwarf buffalo which stands only 70 cm (28 in) high. The Celebes rusa deer (Rusa timorensis macassaricus) is a subspecies of the Javan rusa, which may have been introduced from Sundaland to Sulawesi by humans in ancient times. There are two endemic arboreal primates, Dian's tarsier (Tarsius dentatus) and the Pygmy tarsier (Tarsius pumilus). The majority of endemic species are rodents, including three squirrels and 17 Murid rodents: * montane long-nosed squirrel (Hyosciurus heinrichi) * secretive dwarf squirrel (Prosciurillus abstrusus) * Weber's dwarf squirrel (Prosciurillus weberi) * little soft-furred rat (Rattus mollicomulus) * opossum rat (Rattus marmosurus) * Dollman's spiny rat (Maxomys dollmani) * Watts's spiny rat (Maxomys wattsi) * Celebes shrew-rat (Crunomys celebensis) * long-headed hill rat (Bunomys prolatus) * fraternal hill rat (Bunomys fratrorum) * Heinrich's hill rat (Bunomys heinrichi) * inland hill rat (Bunomys penitus) * Sulawesi soft-furred rat (Eropeplus canus) * elegant margareta rat (Margaretamys elegans) * little margareta rat (Margaretamys parvus) * Salokko rat) (Taeromys arcuatus) * Sulawesi montane rat (Taeromys hamatus) * Sulawesian shrew rat (Melasmothrix naso) * Tate's shrew rat (Tateomys rhinogradoides) * long-tailed shrew rat (Tateomys macrocercus) Another ten species are Sulawesi endemics, which live in both the montane and lowland rain forests ecoregions: * Sulawesi palm civet (Macrogalidia musschenbroekii) * Elongated shrew (Crocidura elongata) * Sulawesi shrew (Crocidura lea) * Sulawesi tiny shrew (Crocidura levicula) * Crested roundleaf bat (Hipposideros inexpectatus) * Minahassa pipistrelle (Pipistrellus minahassae) * Gaskell's false serotine (Hesperoptenus gaskelli) * Yellow- tailed rat (Rattus xanthurus) * Celebes crested macaque (Macaca nigra) * North Sulawesi babirusa (Babyrousa celebensis) The Bola Batu babirusa (Babyrousa bolabatuensis), known only from bones, is recognized as a separate species. No living individuals have been recorded, and the species may be extinct. The ecoregion is home to 168 bird species. 19 species are endemic to the ecoregion, and another 23 are near-endemic.Wikramanayake, Eric; Eric Dinerstein; Colby J. Loucks; et al. (2002).

He is most known for being an aide to the Kennedy Family, during which he helped launch the Peace Corps with R. Sargent Shriver, worked in the 1960 presidential campaign of John F. Kennedy and the 1968 presidential campaign of Robert F. Kennedy. He also assisted prominent Democratic Party figures such as Mario Cuomo and Estes Kefauver and led the fight for affordable medicine as a lobbyist and businessman.  Early Life and Education  Haddad was born on July 25, 1928, in Charlotte, North Carolina to Esther (Nowack) Haddad, a Jewish immigrant from Russia, and Charles Haddad, an Egyptian Jew.He graduated from St. Petersburg Junior College in Florida and received a bachelor‚Äôs degree from Columbia College in 1954. He also studied at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism.  Career  After finishing college, Haddad began a career moving back and forth between business, journalism, and politics. He first worked for Senator Estes Kefauver (D-NY) from 1954 to 1956 and helped secure his nomination as Adlai Stevenson‚Äôs vice- presidential running mate, beating out John F. Kennedy at the 1956 Democratic National Convention. He later worked for the New York Post and helped expose the corruption of Robert Moses, which led to his eventual downfall. He won a Polk Award in 1958 and shared another in 1959 for his investigate reporting. He then took a break from his journalism career and served as special assistant to John F. Kennedy during his presidential campaign. He also served as an aide to Sargent Shriver, with whom he helped found the Peace Corps and served as its as first associate director and inspector general from 1961 to 1963. After his stint at the Peace Corps, Haddad returned to work for the New York Herald Tribune, whose publisher, John Hay Whitney, was his father-in- law.He resigned from the newspaper after spending a few months on the investigative team and unsuccessfully challenged Democratic Congressman Leonard Farbstein for his seat in New York's 19th congressional district. After losing the primary, he served as the inspector general for the Office of Economic Opportunity from 1964 to 1966. He advised Robert F. Kennedy during his presidential campaign in 1968, served on the Board of Education of New York, and enlisted prominent activist Roy Innis in a newspaper called The Manhattan Tribune to provide a biracial perspective. The paper ceased publications in 1972. His business career was also prolific. He joined a venture with John DeLorean in the newly founded DeLorean Motor Company in 1979 and served as its marketing director. He left the company after discovering its financial management and published a book, Hard Driving: My Years With John DeLorean, chronicling the rise and fall of their joint venture. He then served as Mario Cuomo's campaign manager and helped his election as Governor of New York in 1982.Afterwards, he began to lobby to reduce the prices of prescription drugs and served as the chairman of the Generic Pharmaceutical Industry Association that was merged into the Association for Accessible Medicines.His lobbying was instrumental in the passing of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act in 1984, which helped launch the generic drug industry in the United States. He also worked with Indian scientist Yusuf Hamied of Cipla to distribute low-cost medicine to combat AIDS in Africa and India.  Personal Life  In 1959, Haddad married Kate Roosevelt, daughter of Congressman James Roosevelt and Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney, granddaughter of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and pioneering neurosurgeon Harvey Cushing. Her mother divorced James Roosevelt and was remarried to John Hay Whitney, the American Ambassador to the United Kingdom, who adopted Roosevelt as his daughter. The marriage ended in divorce and his second marriage to Noreen Walsh also ended in divorce. He died on April 30, 2020 due to congestive heart failure. He is survived by Lulie Haddad, Laura Whitney-Thomas and Andrea Haddad, children from his first marriage, Amanda Reina and Robert Haddad from his second marriage, a stepson, 13 grandchildren, and two great-grandsons.

Life  Chang grew up in mostly in San Francisco and Davis, California. She graduated from UC Berkeley and received her MFA from Syracuse University in 2018. She currently lives in Ithaca, NY with her husband, and their dog and cat. Chang used to write about technology for Wired. In an interview for BOMB Magazine, Chang said of that time: \\"When I started as a tech reporter, I felt like I made it. It was a thrill to cover these companies and start-ups that were becoming a huge part of all our lives...Over time, I started to feel disillusioned with the job...I wanted to capture how it can be for a young woman of color in these predominantly white spaces, where the system is working against her in small and large ways, and how that affects her psyche and ability to continue contributing to those spaces.\\"  Career  Days of Distraction follows a 24-year-old narrator, a staff writer at a tech publication who is continuously undervalued at her company. When her longtime boyfriend, J, gets into Cornell for graduate school, she decides to move to Ithaca with him. But instead of the fresh new start she hoped for, she finds herself with misgivings about her role in an interracial relationship. She turns to Asian American history to try and rediscover her sense of self, confronting the question: What does it mean to exist in a society that does not notice or understand you? USA Today said Days of Distraction is \\"Gripping‚Ä¶. Pointed, witty, and free of easy resolutions. And Chang‚Äôs deadpan style offers up moments of absurd humor‚Ä¶. Chang shows the challenge of trying to raise issues about racism that even those closest to her wish to avoid. Struggling to spark a conversation nobody wants to have, she conducts an engrossing one with herself.\\" O, The Oprah Magazine said Chang \\"transmutes millennial malaise into an astute meditation on identity in the age of algorithms with this deadpan novel of an Asian American journalist fighting to be truly seen‚Äîby both her employer and her white boyfriend.\\" Chang previously worked as a technology reporter for WIRED and Macworld. In Vanity Fair, Chang said that at the time she was writing her novel, ‚ÄúI was drawn to books that played with both nonfiction, memoir elements and ultimately inhabit the space of fiction because of the way they‚Äôre written, or the way the character functions, or the ways that the author has moved away from any sort of ‚Äòrules‚Äô of memoir.‚Äù George Saunders called the novel a \\"startlingly original and deeply moving debut‚Äîkaleidoscopic, funny, heart-rending, beautifully observed, and formally daring.\\" The Washington Post said \\"The story is fractured, like our attention, our nation, our relationships; the information looks like the snippets we consume: Facebook posts, tweets, Google results. But for all its formal interplay and textual shifts, the novel is also, somehow, a cohesive, thoroughly absorbing read. It‚Äôs a mixed marriage of new forms and old that captures modern life then shapes it into something artistically abiding.\\" The New York Times called it \\"a winning novel from a writer to watch.\\" Days of Distraction includes a fragment from Maxine Hong Kingston's The Woman Warrior, of which Chang says: \\"I read Woman Warrior when I was an undergraduate, in my sophomore or junior year. Before that, I had never read a memoir by a Chinese American woman‚Ä¶ It was a foundational text to me.\\" Chang has a short story collection named Tomb Sweeping that is forthcoming from Ecco Books.

It have several characters unusual for a pycnogonid, such as swimming legs with alternating size, medially-arranged eyes, and most significantly, a long, segmented abdomen, which were highly reduced in modern counterparts.  Morphology  Palaeoisopus is a large sea spider, with a body length (excluding proboscis and chelifores) of at least 12.5 cm and leg spans of about 32 cm, comparable to those of a modern Colossendeis (giant sea spider). The margins of each of its body parts were covered by tubercles, the cephalon (head section that bore eyes, proboscis, chelifores, palps, ovigers and 1st leg pair) and 3 trunk somites (section that bore the remaining leg pairs) are well-defined by ring-like segmentation. The abdomen apparently compose of 4 abdominal somites and a styliform telson, but based on the medial position of anus (which, in telson-bearing chelicerates, always located at the ventral boundary of abdomen and telson), the latter was also suggest to be a fusion of 5th abdominal somite and the original telson. File:Palaeoisopus (7992699932).jpgFossil of Palaeoisopus, showing the long, fully-extended 1st leg pair. File:Palaeoisopus problematicus 4343.JPGVentral fossil, showing full set of appendages. File:Palaeoisopus problematicus Naturalis.JPGFossil compose of 3 individuals, showing dorsal morphology. Medial to the anterodorsal margin of cephalon was an eye-bearing ocular tubercle. Unlike the paired 4-eyed arrangement of most pycnogonids, it compose of a pair of large eyes and 2 smaller eyes that arranged anteroposteriorly in a midline. The anteriormost appendages were a pair of robust, pincer-like chelifores, which compose of 5 podomeres (3 for scape and 2 for pincer) instead of 3 or 4 (1 or 2 for scape and 2 for pincer) like those of the other pycnogonids. Below the chelifores was a cylinderal proboscis that always tucked underneath the cephalon, making it almost invisible in dorsal view. The palps and ovigers have similar morphology, the former terminated with a subchelate structures and the latter was apparently absent in some specimens, which may represent sexual dimorphism as seen in some modern pycnogonid taxa such as Pycnogonidae and Phoxichilidiidae (female lacking ovigers). Each of the leg base was surrounded by flexible, ring-like structure. Among the 4 leg pairs the first one is significantly elongated, and its detail morphology slightly differ from the posterior counterparts as well (e.g. shorter basal segments, different setae arrangement, 4 flatten distal podomeres instead of 5).  Paleoecology  The large eyes, robust chelifores and oar-like legs suggest that Paleoisopus was a nektonic (swimming) visual predators, with associated stalked crinoid (sea lily) as a possible prey item.  Phylogeny  While some analysis placing Palaeoisopus within a derived position, most studies suggest that Paleosiopus is a basal sea spider, as the well-developed abdomen most likely represent a plesiomorphic condition of total-group Pycnogonida.

He competed during the 1980s to 2000s in the World Marathon Majors. He won the 1988 Chicago Marathon with a time of 2:08:57. At the age of twenty, Cruz's 1988 win made him the youngest man and first Mexican to win the Chicago Marathon. In later Chicago Marathons, Cruz placed fourth in 1994 and did not finish the 1998 edition. Cruz also finished 4th at the 1991 Boston Marathon and 23rd at the 1993 New York City Marathon. At other marathon events, Cruz placed 5th at the 1995 Summer Universiade and 42nd at the 1999 World Championships in Athletics. In overall points, Cruz was first in the 1993 Runner's World men's rankings based on his 1992 race finishes. Cruz continued to run primarily in North America until his last marathon in 2009. Biography Cruz was born in Mexico City, Mexico, on February 10, 1968. As a child, he played association football before becoming a runner at the age of seventeen. For his races, Cruz competed in multiple disciplines ranging from 10 km to the marathon. Cruz started his marathon career in Mexico before entering his first American marathons in 1988. During an Olympic trial for Mexico in 1988, Cruz finished sixth at the Los Angeles Marathon. Later that year, Cruz was chosen to join the six-runner Mexican contingent as an emergency backup for Mauricio Gonzalez when Gonz√°lez could not compete at the 1988 Chicago Marathon due to injury. At the time, Cruz was studying at the University of Mexico for a civil engineering degree. Cruz won the 1988 Chicago Marathon with a time of 2:08:57. He became the youngest man to win the Chicago Marathon, and also set the fastest time for a twenty-year old in any marathon. He was also the first-ever person from Mexico to win the Chicago Marathon. Cruz later reappeared at Chicago in 1994 and finished in 4th place. He also entered the 1998 edition but did not finish the event. In other World Marathon Majors, Cruz competed at the Boston Marathon and New York City Marathon between 1991 and 2000. His best results were a 4th-place finish at the 1991 Boston Marathon and 23rd at the 1993 New York City Marathon. Outside of the World Marathon Majors, Cruz was 5th at the marathon event in the 1995 Summer Universiade. Cruz also ran in the marathon at the 1999 World Championships in Athletics and finished the race in 42nd place. While primarily running in North America, Cruz travelled to various places for his races including Puerto Rico, Japan, and Guatemala. Cruz continued to run in marathons until 2009. Overall, Cruz was first in points for the 1993 Runner's World men's open rankings based on his 1992 race results.

A large number of devotees visit here and all Manglik works are also done. This temple is known as Shyama Mai's temple. Shyama Mai's temple is built on the pyre of Maharaja Rameshwar Singh at the crematorium Ghat and is an unusual occurrence in itself. Maharaja Rameshwar Singh was one of the seeker kings of the Darbhanga royal family. Due to the name of the king, this temple is known as Rameshwari Shyama Mai. The temple was founded by Maharaj Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga in 1933. Festivals In the sanctum sanctorum, a huge statue of Maa Kali is installed on the right side of Mahakal and Ganapati and Batukabhairava Dev on the left. The Mund Mala around the neck of the mother has the equivalent of the letters of the Hindi alphabet. Devotees believe that this is because the Hindi alphabet is a symbol of creation. Aarti held in the temple has special significance. Devotees who come here wait for hours to join the temple aarti. During Navratri, the number of devotees increases and a fair is held here. History The statue of mother was brought from Paris - Historians say that this statue came from Paris. Visiting the feet of Mother Shyama Kali fulfills every wish of the devotees. On the part of the mother, there is a delectable Raktim or yellow cloth. This idol of Maa Kali is of four arms. The right hand always blesses the visiting refugees. The entire temple complex is always in a bustling mood and the atmosphere is vibrant with Jai Shyama Mai's Jayghosh. Legends In this temple, mother Kali is worshiped with both Vedic and Tantric methods. Usually in Hinduism the couple does not go to the cremation ground until after 1 year of marriage. But in this temple built in the cremation ground, not only newlyweds come to seek blessings, but weddings are also done in this temple. Experts say that Shyama Mai Mata is the form of Sita. Laldas, who was a servant of King Rameshwar Singh, has explained this in the Rameshwar Charit Mithila Ramayana. It is derived from the Ramayana composed by Valmiki. It is told that after Ravana was killed, Mother-Sita told Lord Rama that whoever slays Sahatrananda will be the real hero. On this, Lord Rama went out to kill him. During the war, Lord Rama got an arrow from Sahasranand. Mother Sita became very angry on this and killed Sahastranand. Mother's color turned black with anger. Even after the slaughter, his anger did not calm down, so Lord Shiva himself had to come to stop him. As soon as the feet were placed on the Lord's chest, the mother was very ashamed and the tongue came out of her mouth. This form of Mother is worshiped and she is called here as Kali not Shyama.

Leo was born in the first half of the twelfth century in Pisa. He was the younger brother of Hugo Etherianus. Nothing about his early life or education is known, nor where he and his brother acquired Greek. He probably arrived in Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire, with his brother around 1160. They were certainly there when the controversy around Demetrius of Lampe broke out in 1166. They were not the first Pisan translators with knowledge of Greek to live in Constantinople; Burgundio of Pisa had gone before. Leo is attested between 1171 and 1182 as a translator and interpreter in the Byzantine chancery. He bore the Latin title imperialis aule interpres (translator of the imperial court) or imperalium epistolarum interpres (translator of imperial letters). He accompanied Manuel II on his campaign against the Sultanate of Rum in 1173‚Äì1176, culminating in his defeat in the Battle of Myriokephalon. He used his influence at court in 1177 to secure his brother's freedom after the latter was imprisoned by the tax collector Astaforte. In 1176, Leo sent his brother a translation of the Oneirocriticon of Achmet, a treatise on oneiromancy. For this work he acknowledged the assistance of his nephew Fabrizio. He was not the only westerner interested in magic and the occult in Constantinople at the time. Pascalis Romanus wrote his Liber thesauri occulti in 1165 based on the ancient Greek Oneirocritica and in 1169 made a translation of the Cyranides. One copy of the Liber thesauri occulti was even expanded with material from Leo's Oneirocriticon. Leo's translation circulated widely in manuscript and was translated and pritned in Italian (1546) and French (1552). In the latter half of the 1070s, Leo wrote a treatise on the heresies and prevarications of the Greeks, De haeresibus et praevaricationibus Graecorum, related in content to his brother's theological writings. The first part, which details the errors of the Greek church, was used by the anonymous Dominican author of the Tractatus contra Graecos (1252). The second part, which lists twelve reasons for the East‚ÄìWest Schism, was summarized by the Dominican Humbert of Romans (died 1277). In 1177 or 1178, Leo translated the liturgy of John Chrysostom at the request of the Aragonese ambassador Ramon de Montcada, who was in Constantinople to negotiate the marriage of Count Ramon Berenguer III of Provence and Manuel's daughter, Eudokia Komnene. A copy of Leo's translation was acquired by William of Aversa, archbishop of Otranto, and brought to Italy before 1198. His interest piqued, William then asked Nicholas of Otranto to translate for him the liturgy of Saint Basil. Leo survived the Massacre of the Latins in April 1182. On 7 December 1182, Pope Lucius III wrote a letter informing him of his brother's death in Italy. He sent the letter with Fabrizio and asked Leo to give him details of the massacre. There is no further information about Leo (who must have received the letter in early 1183) and it is unknown if he died in Constantinople or if he ever returned to Italy.

Education and professional positions Cohendet graduated in 1991 from the Jean Moulin University Lyon 3 with a doctorate in political science. She wrote her doctoral dissertation on the period between 1986 and 1988 when the President of France faced an antagonistic majority in the French Parliament, with a particular focus on the unprecedented strain that this situation put on French political and legal institutions. Cohendet's thesis was called L'√©preuve de la cohabitation : mars 1986‚Äìmai 1988, and was supervised by Pierre Vialle. It was successful in the public law agr√©gation of 1992. In September of 1992, Cohendet was appointed to the faculty of Jean Moulin University Lyon 3. She was subsequently a professor at Lumi√®re University Lyon 2 and at Institut d'√©tudes politiques de Lyon. She was then appointed to The University of Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne.

Keneu is a golden eagle and Oshadagea carries a lake of dew on its back, which it will sprinkle as rain after fire spirits attack the land. H√©-no is armed with bow and arrows, and carries with him a pouch of thunderbolts. When travelling in the skies, he also carries a basket of chert boulders on his back, which he hurls at evil spirits. The boulders that miss fall to earth in the form of lightning.

H√©-no was described as peaceful and benevolent, being the enemy of witches and evil persons, and the friend of corn, beans and squashes. Apart from being associated with thunders, H√©-no was also thought to form clouds and give water to the earth. In Iroquois mythology, H√©-no descended to earth twice.

History In 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev became the new general secretary of the CPSU, implementing a planned reform of the Soviet Union. The two reforms were known as perestroika and glasnost, the latter of which granted the freedom for Soviet citizens to express any grievances whereas the former allowed economic reform in the Soviet system. This came at a time when support for the integration of Nagorno Karabakh into the Armenian SSR was high, with the movement for this change dating back to a petition in 1963. Capitalizing on Gorbachev's policies, the leaders of the regional Supreme Soviet of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast voted in favor of separating itself from the Azerbaijan SSR and unifying with Soviet Armenia on 20 February 1988. A couple days later, Boris Kevorkov, who served as the unpopular First Secretary of the Nagorno-Karabakh Regional Committee of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan, was fired by the Supreme Soviet. The actions of the soviet saw the events at Sumgait to occur as well as marked beginning of the Nagorno-Karabakh War. Significance The date became an official holiday in 1992. Official greetings are extended from the President of Armenia, the Prime Minister of Armenia and the President of Artsakh among other major leaders. Former leaders such as Robert Kocharyan have also extended greetings on the holiday. In 2020, Artsakh President Bako Sahakyan described it as \\"the symbol of our people‚Äôs courage, determination and love for freedom, our nation-wide solidarity\\".

Early life  Telaumbanua was born on 30 September 1919, as the son of a clergy named Kar√∂r√∂wa Telaumbanua who was married to Otilie. He was born in the city of Gunungsitoli, the capital of Nias. He began to study at the Hollandsch-Inlandsche School (Dutch school for indigenous people) in Tarutung, graduating from the school in 1936, and continued to study at the Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs (extended elementary school), and graduated in 1940. Since then, he moved to Surakarta, and continued his studies at the Hollandsche Indische Kweekschool (Teachers' School). He only reached the fifth class and did not graduate from the school. He returned to Nias, where he entered the Priest School and graduated from the school in 1943 with the title of Pandita.  Career  After his graduation from the Priest School, Telaumbanua returned to Nias, and began his career as a priest, and began his service in the BNKP (Banua Niha Keriso Protestan, Protestant Christian Church of Nias). He began his political career after the independence career, when he was elected as the First Chairman of the Indonesian National Committee of Nias on 13 October 1945.  As the Head of Luhak of Nias  Roos Telaumbanua as the Head of Luhak of Nias. A year later, on November 1946, the Head of Luhak (regency) of Nias, Daliziduhu Marunduri, handed over his power to Telaumbanua. Telaumbanua still held the position of the Chairman of the Indonesian National Committee of Nias. = Sumatra Conference  Regional Money of Republic Indonesia for Nias = Due to the inaccessibility of Nias from the Sumatran mainland, the Regional Money of Republic Indonesia (ORIPDA) that was printed in Bukittinggi for Sumatra could not be distributed to Nias. Naval blockades that was imposed by the Dutch Navy in the West Sumatran coastline caused the scarcity of official ORIPDA banknotes and caused riots in Nias society. To cope this problem, Telaumbanua asked the Government of Sumatra for the Nias government to print their own banknotes. The Governor of Sumatra, Teuku Muhammad Hasan, approved Telaumbanua's idea, and from 1947 and 1949, the Government of Nias began to print their own banknotes. The banknotes were named ORIPDA-Nias. The first emission of the banknotes was printed on 25 September 1947. The second and third emission was printed on 20 December 1948 and 5 January 1949. All of the banknotes was signed by Telaumbanua himself to ensure the authenticity of the banknotes. = People's Representative Council of Nias = On 19 November 1949, Yunan Nasution from the People's Representative Council of Sumatra,was sent to Nias to form the People's Representative Council of Nias, in accordance with the Law No. 22 of 1948. The committee was dissolved, and the position of Speaker was given ex officio to Telaumbanua.  As the Regent of Nias  Telaumbanua as the Regent of Nias. On 1 July 1950, the position of Head of Luhak was abolished. Telaumbanua was given the title of Regent, and the Luhak of Nias was transformed into the Nias Regency. At the end of March 1950, the governor of the province of Tapanuli and East Sumatra, Ferdinand Lumbantobing, went to Nias. He stated that although there has been a People's Representative Council in Nias, the position of the Speaker of the People's Representative Council was still held by the regent. Lumbantobing thus requested that both positions should be separated in order to comply with the law. Since 31 January 1954, Telaumbanua resigned from his position as the Regent of Nias, and was replaced by Humala Frederick Situmorang.  Career (1954‚Äì1964)  After his resignation from his office, Telaumbanua seated several offices in North Sumatra. From 1954 until 1958, he was employed as the regent for decentralization and autonomy affairs in the office of the Governor of North Sumatra; 1958 until 1961 he was appointed as the Chairman of the North Sumatra Regional Development Coordinating Board; 1961 until 1962, he was appointed as the Resident of East Sumatra. He also participated in the formation of the Indonesian Red Cross Society of North Sumatra as its first chairman. In 1962, he studied at the Indonesian Army Command and General Staff College, and was given the titular rank of major.  Acting Mayor of Medan  Roos Telaumbanua as the Mayor of Medan. On 10 October 1964, Telaumbanua was appointed by the Governor of North Sumatra as the acting Mayor of Medan, replacing Basyrah Lubis. According to the Nefo magazine, Telaumbanua was appointed due to the lack of ethics and morality of the previous mayors of Medan. He resigned from the position on 27 August 1965.  Acting Governor of North Sumatra  On 16 November 1965, Telaumbanua was appointed as the acting governor of North Sumatra, who replaced the previous governor Ulung Sitepu that was imprisoned for 24 years due to his alleged involvement in the 30 September Movement. He was tasked by the President to \\"carry out the politics of the New Order government, implementing the 1945 Constitution and Pancasila in a pure and consistent manner.\\" As acting governor, Telaumbanua began his term by \\"cleaning\\" the remainings of the 30 September Movement. He began dismissing and arresting civil employees who were alleged to be involved in subversive activities relating to the movement. = Pematangsiantar Mayor problem = On 29 December 1966, Telaumbanua appointed a new acting mayor, Mulatua Pardede, for the city of Pematangsiantar. His decision was disregarded by the acting mayor at the time, Tarip Siregar. This problem caused Medan to de facto having two mayors. Siregar was supported by the popular youth movement in Pematangsiantar, such as the Pancasila Front and the Anti 30 September Movement Committee of Pematangsiantar, while Pardede was supported by Telaumbanua. The groups that supported Siregar sent a protest to the Interior Minister demanding to remove Pardede out of office. Telaumbanua defended himself by stating that he removed Siregar from his office as instructed by the military area commander of North Sumatra, on which the commander argued that Pematangsiantar has experienced lack of development during Siregar's term, and Siregar himself was in ill health. The dualism of mayor in Pematangsiantar caused confusion to the civil employees working in the city, as both claimed that they were the legitimate mayor. Tarip Siregar insisted to remain in his office, forcing Pardede to held office in the former Siantar Mayor's residence. Siregar brought this problem to Colonel Selamat Gintings, the Regional Military Commander, but he received empty response. In response to this problem, Arnold Baramuli from the Ministry of Internal Affairs was given full mandate by Telaumbanua to solve this problem. Baramuli decided that Pardede was the rightful acting mayor of Pematangsiantar. Thus, on 28 January 1967, a ceremony was planned to transfer the mayor position from Siregar to Pardede. Even though the ceremony was officially recognized, both Baramuli and Siregar did not attend the ceremony. Siregar was reported to be abducted by a group of unidentified youths. = Corruption and bribery allegations = Telaumbanua as the Acting Governor of North Sumatra. At the end of his term, Telaumbanua was accused of accepting bribes amounting to 16 million rupiah (around $13,000) for giving a permit for building booths ‚Äî which had been intended for building 16 public toilets ‚Äî during his term as the acting Mayor, and several other accusations during his term as the acting Governor, such as abusing his power, manipulating copra shipments, and supply of rice. Further investigations also stated that he issued an order to form Barisan Sukarno (Sukarno Brigade) and that he was responsible for the escape of a prisoner. Christian groups, such as the Sinar Harapan newspaper (newspaper owned by the Indonesian Christian Party), and the KESPEKRI, denied the allegations. Sinar Harapan stated that the allegations were fabricated by Chinese groups to foil Telaumbanua's nomination as the definitive Governor of North Sumatra, while KESPEKRI demonstrated its support to Telaumbanua over the case. The Chief Prosecutor of North Sumatra, Djuang Harahap, summoned Telaumbanua over the corruption accusations, but after two occasions, Telaumbanua failed to show up to his trial. A delegation under E.M.L. Tobing attempted to stop the trial of Telaumbanua. The delegation threatened that pushing ahead with the trial could cause a \\"physical clash\\" that would endanger the safety of officials of the Chief Prosecutor's Office. Harahap replied to Tobing that he would not \\"bow down to such terrorism\\". Harahap's stance towards the threat was supported by the Sumatra NU Students' Union, and stating that the organization is prepared to face anybody who threatens the Chief Prosecutor's safety. = Nomination as Governor of North Sumatra = On 20 January 1967, the newspaper Angkatan Bersendjata (Armed Forces) reported that Telaumbanua was mentioned as possible candidates, among other 12 candidates. Soon, the number of candidates shrunk down. By January 24, Christian Lumbangaol, the regional secretary of North Sumatra, stated that there was only three possible candidates, namely Telaumbanua, Marah Halim Harahap, and Tumpal Dorianus Pardede. Telaumbanua and Pardede's candidacy was questioned by various groups, such as the Peasants' Action Committee and Central Indonesian Labor Action Front, due to Telaumbanua's corruption and bribery allegations, and Pardede's participation in the Dwikora cabinets. The three candidates were officially nominated to the Regional People's Representative Council of North Sumatra. Harahap was nominated by Golkar, Telaumbanua by the Indonesian Christian Party, and Pardede by the Indonesian National Party. In an unofficial polling of the 39 members of the council, Harahap was supported by 15 members, Telaumbanua by 11 members, and Pardede by 4 members. Eleven members of the council did not support any of the candidates but stated they would take part in the upcoming elections. The election was held on 6 February 1967. Harahap won the elections by 24 votes, while Telaumbanua only obtained 14 votes. One member abstained from the election, and the Indonesian National Party withdrawn Pardede's candidacy. As Telaumbanua lost the elections, the Indonesian Christian Party nominated Telaumbanua as the Deputy Governor instead. His nomination as the Deputy Governor was not approved by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and sparked protests from various organizations in North Sumatra.  Later life  After the inauguration of Marah Halim Harahap on 30 March 1967, Telaumbanua moved to Jakarta, and became an expert staff in the Ministry of Internal Affairs. During this period, he became the member of the Executive Council of the Indonesian Christian Party. In 1970, he moved to Golkar, and was nominated on 1971 for the People's Representative Council from the organization for the 1971 Indonesian legislative election. He was elected as the member of the People's Representative Council, representing Nias. After his term ended on 1 October 1977, he returned to Nias in 1981. He died on 16 February 1987 in Medan.  Personal  He was married to Ramina Barasi Zebua. The marriage resulted in twelve children.  Legacy  By the people of Nias, Telaumbanua was given the title of Balugu Sofut√∂ngah√∂n√∂. His name was proposed for the name of a street in Medan.

Health issues Around the age of 20, Soranno went from being healthy to becoming chronically ill and was diagnosed with POTS at age 20. After seeing 14 different specialists in Canada, she sought help in the US. She was diagnosed in November 2013 with Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS). She has also been diagnosed with Lyme disease and Sj√∂gren syndrome. At one point she was confined to her bed 90% of the time. Her family created a documentary about her case to raise awareness, releasing it in May 2015, to coincide with Lyme Disease Awareness Month. They established a fundraising campaign for her medical expenses on GoFundMe. On July 20, 2019, while giving a headline speech, Soranno suddenly sat down on a chair. Soranno then briefly explained that she was ‚Äúsick\\" and suffers from a heart condition, nerve disorder, connective tissue disease, and significant allergy responses. Soranno stated \\"my suffering is insignificant in comparison\\" and then focused the remaining 45 minutes of her speech on animal rights activism. Activism Soranno has been part of an animal rights movement called \\"Meat The Victims\\", which originated in Australia. She engaged in the first \\"Meat the Victims\\" action in Canada on April 28, 2019. During that action, approx 65 activists entered, without authorization, Excelsior Hog Farm in Abbotsford, British Columbia.The group obtained video of the animals and refused to leave until members of the media were allowed inside the facility. Outside the farm more than 100 additional activists lined the street. The protest was sparked by a video released by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Negotiations with the police lasted for seven hours and then, after all demands were met, Soranno was the only one arrested and taken to the police station. Soranno has also been an organizer for \\"Okanagan Animal Save\\", part of the global Animal Save Movement, in which she coordinated protests and vigils for animals at various farms, abattoirs and events.

During the summer of 2019, she, along with other DxE protestors, entered a Maple Leaf Foods Slaughterhouse in Toronto, Canada. Once inside, they had their arms affixed to a bin filled with cement. On June 3, 2019 Soranno \\"stormed police lines\\" in Sonoma County, California to assist leading approximately 600 activists to protest at a lock-down, which was already in effect, outside the Reichardt Duck Farm. At the Interior Savings Credit Union headquarters in downtown Kelowna, BC, on November 18, 2019, Soranno, along with others, chained herself to the doors.Her group was protesting the ISC's sponsorship of Ribfest, which they claimed promoted cruelty to animals.They were arrested for mischief as a result.

Georgiana Fane was an English heiress, daughter of John Fane, 10th Earl of Westmorland and his second wife the former Jane Huck-Saunders. Her mother bore four other children before separating from her father, after ten years of marriage. Georgiana is known for two things, a much commented upon portrait of her, when she was five or six years old, dressed as a peasant girl, and for her apparent stalking of the Duke of Wellington. She met Wellington in 1815, shortly after his final victory over Napoleon Bonaparte, at the Battle of Waterloo, when she was fourteen years old, and he was 47. Lord Palmerston, who was carrying on an affair with her married half-sister, Sarah Villiers, Countess of Jersey, proposed to Georgiana, twice, in 1823, but she turned him down. The existence of suggestive letters, from Wellington, seems to confirm they did have a sexual relationship in the 1820s. After his wife, the former Kitty Pakenham, died in 1830, Georgiana, and several other women intensified their interest in Wellington, hoping to become his second wife. She could not accept his rejection of her, and harassed him for the rest of his life.

It is known particularly for developing the approach of mindfulness-based pain management (MBPM), which shares many elements with mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) but is adapted specifically for those living with chronic pain and illness, and incorporates a distinctive emphasis on the practice of 'loving-kindness'. Breathworks is a registered Community Interest Company (CIC) in the United Kingdom, and has nearly 500 accredited teachers working in 35 countries.  History  Breathworks was founded in 2004 by Vidyamala Burch, Sona Fricker, and Gary Hennessey, growing out of a 2001 pilot scheme funded by a grant from the UK's Millennium Commission. This grant supported Burch to receive training from Jon Kabat-Zinn in mindfulness-based stress reduction, and enabled her to begin a \\"Peace of Mind\\" course in Manchester that used mindfulness and loving-kindness meditations to help those suffering from chronic pain. Drawing on her own experience of severe long-term back pain and partial paraplegia, Burch emphasized the need to turn towards difficult experiences with acceptance and kindness rather than continually struggling to defeat or overcome them. The pilot course received a positive response from participants, and was inundated with inquiries. An ordained member of the Triratna Buddhist Order, Burch worked with other members of the Order to found Breathworks, and initially focused the organization on creating a community of trainers who could share the \\"Peace of Mind\\" program more widely.  Current work  Subsequent to its foundation in 2004 Breathworks has grown rapidly, playing an active role in the UK mindfulness teaching community and establishing an international presence. In 2005 Breathworks was a founding member of the UK Network of Mindfulness-Based Teacher Training Organisations (later renamed the British Association of Mindfulness-based Approaches, or BAMBA), and since then has adhered to this organization's Good Practice Guidelines for training mindfulness teachers and delivering courses. The majority of Breathworks trainers and teachers now come from a very wide range of professions and backgrounds and Breathworks is clear that, while drawing on contemplative training derived from Buddhism, it offers a secular mindfulness pathway appropriate to a wide range of applications. Breathworks established its Teacher Training Pathway in 2005, and by 2019 there were almost 500 accredited Breathworks teachers working in 35 countries, reaching 11,000 people. Breathworks is a registered Community Interest Company in the UK, meaning that its profits are used to provide bursaries and scholarships for its programs through the Breathworks Foundation charity. Breathworks now offers a range of mindfulness programs catering to people with varied needs and circumstances. The \\"Peace of Mind\\" program evolved into the 8-week Mindfulness for Health course, which in 2015 was delivered to over 800 people in the UK. This course is aimed primarily at those suffering from chronic pain and illness, and is the main vehicle through which Breathworks delivers mindfulness-based pain management (MBPM). A parallel 8-week course for those suffering primarily from stress - the Mindfulness for Stress course - was developed by Gary Hennessey, and in 2015 was delivered to over 1000 people in the UK. Breathworks also offers bespoke Mindfulness in the Workplace programs. In 2020 Breathworks began offering live online versions of its Teacher Training, Mindfulness for Health, Mindfulness for Stress, and Mindfulness in the Workplace programs, allowing it to continue to reach significant numbers during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Mindfulness-Based Pain Management (MBPM)  Breathworks is known particularly for developing the approach of mindfulness-based pain management (MBPM). Drawing on the experience of Breathworks co-founder Vidyamala Burch, MBPM adapts the core concepts and practices of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) to create a program specifically tailored to those living with chronic pain and illness. In addition to using shorter meditations and integrating a pacing program into the course, MBPM includes a distinctive emphasis on the concepts of \\"primary\\" and \\"secondary\\" suffering, and on the practice of \\"loving-kindness\\". Utilizing a \\"six-step process\\" oriented towards the cultivation of qualities such as awareness, acceptance, sympathetic joy, equanimity, loving-kindness, and choice, MBPM has been seen as sensitive to concerns about the dangers of removing mindfulness teaching from its original ethical framework, while also providing a secular evidence-based approach appropriate for people of all faiths, and none. MBPM is delivered primarily through the Breathworks Mindfulness for Health course, but has also been adapted to those suffering from stress in the Mindfulness for Stress course. A 2018 literature review found that research on the Mindfulness for Health and Stress courses has shown them \\"to be very helpful for people with severe chronic pain and illness\\", but also noted that further randomized controlled trials were needed.

Son of William Rainey Harper, Samuel N. Harper was an important figure for the establishment and continuation of Russian studies at The University of Chicago.  Early life and education  Harper was born on April 9th, 1882 in the Morgan Park neighborhood of Chicago, the eldest son of William Rainey Harper and Ella Paul Harper. His early years were shaped by the founding of the University that would later house him as lecturer. His father became the University of Chicago's first President in 1891. In 1900, Wiliam Rainey visited Russia in the company of Charles R. Crane, a wealthy Chicago businessman particularly interested in Eastern Europe. Among others, William Rainey Harper met tsar Nicholas II and Leo Tolstoy on this trip (the latter was disturbed that the President spent much of his time trying to secure funds for the University). William Rainey Harper returned to Chicago determined to eventually start a program for the study of Russia and also to send his own son abroad to learn a new language. The same year, Samuel N. Harper worked as a guard at the Paris Exposition while it was announced that he was to become the first American expert on Russia. Harper received a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Chicago in 1902. He received the Diploma from the School of Oriental Languages (Dipl√¥me de l'Ecole des Langues Orientales Vivantes) in Paris in 1905, studying under Paul Jean Marie Boyer, a known specialist in Russian language training.  Career  Samuel N. Harper spent the bulk of Russia's pre-revolutionary years among the intelligentsia of St. Petersburg and Moscow while funded by Charles Crane to teach Russian at the University of Chicago for half of the year, often collaborating on his studies with Bernard Pares. After his father's death, he was assisted by his mother Ella Paul in sorting and archiving his and his father's work - hence meticulous records of the founding of the University, the Russian program, and early 20th-century Russian materials remain in the University's archives. Harper briefly attended Columbia University between 1909 and 1911. He fell short of finishing his PhD dissertation when Pares suggested for him to come to University of Liverpool to teach Russian while closer to the country itself. The arrangement was short-lived - it became clear that Pares and Harper found themselves on opposing political sides with regard to Russia, Harper later supporting the more moderate reforms of the February Revolution and Pares eventually becoming a public supporter of Stalin. Harper abandoned the post in 1913. He returned to teaching at the University of Chicago as an Assistant Professor on Russian Language and Institutions in 1914. He briefly served as Special Assistant to the U.S. State Department, Russian Division from 1918 to 1922, and on the committee that concerned itself with the authenticity of the Sisson Documents.

The British Pain Society has recognized her \\"outstanding contribution to the alleviation of pain\\", and in 2019 she was named on the Shaw Trust Power 100 list of the most influential disabled people in the UK. Burch's book Mindfulness for Health won the British Medical Association's 2014 Medical Books Award in the Popular Medicine category.  Early life  Born Prudence Burch in Wellington, New Zealand in 1959, Burch enjoyed walking and mountaineering as a child and teenager, especially in New Zealand's Southern Alps. At the age of 16, she fractured a vertebra in her spine while lifting someone from a swimming pool, and due to a congenital spine condition suffered severe long-term consequences. Within six months she required major surgery, which itself caused complications requiring further surgery. Burch's life \\"changed overnight\\", and ever since she has suffered from chronic back pain and varying levels of disability. At the age of 23 Burch was involved in a major car accident which fractured another of her vertebrae, significantly worsening her pain and debility. After working for two years as a film and sound editor (including for Vincent Ward's film Vigil), Burch's health suffered a complete collapse, and in 1985 she was hospitalized in an intensive care ward. During her time in hospital, Burch had a number of experiences that profoundly shaped her future life. The most important, which she has described as \\"the axis on which my life has turned\\", occurred after having a procedure after which she was required her to sit upright for 24 hours to avoid complications, causing her almost unbearable pain. She writes: Burch suddenly \\"saw that the present moment is always bearable\\", and that \\"much of my torment had grown from fear of the future\\". She felt \\"the tension torturing me open into expansiveness\\", and knew that \\"something extraordinary had broken through\\". According to Burch, this experience showed her \\"a completely different way of being\\", which \\"it has taken me many years... to integrate... into my daily experience in a way that's sustainable and practical\\". The way that Burch eventually integrated these insights into her life was meditation and mindfulness practice, which she was also introduced to during her 1985 hospital stay. A hospital chaplain guided her through a visualization meditation which she experienced as transformative, showing her that \\"although my body was broken to some extent... my mind could be a tool for healing and well-being\\". After leaving hospital, she spent several years experimenting in \\"do it yourself\\" meditation and yoga, and investigating Hindu philosophy. She eventually discovered Buddhism, and \\"started attending Buddhism and meditation classes in Auckland with the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order (FWBO), now renamed the Triratna Buddhist Community.\\" She quickly became a committed Buddhist, and in 1990, at the age of 30, she moved from New Zealand to the UK to live at Taraloka, a rural residential Buddhist retreat center for women. She lived there for 5 years, and during this time trained intensively in meditation and mindfulness - particularly mindfulness of breathing and loving-kindness meditation. She has described her time at Taraloka as \\"very intense, but I knew I needed this kind of strong medicine if I was to transform my mind in any lasting and meaningful way.\\" In 1995 she was ordained into the Triratna Buddhist Order and took the name \\"Vidyamala\\", meaning \\"garland of wisdom\\". In 1997, at the age of 37, Burch suffered another major deterioration in her health, becoming paralyzed in her bowel and bladder and partially paralyzed in her legs, meaning she had to use a wheelchair. For around five years, until she had a further surgery in 2002, she was largely housebound, and was forced to spent many months lying flat on her back. She has described this time as a \\"dark voyage\\", during which \\"I had to face my deepest and most destructive habits, especially my tendency to overdo things and then 'crash and burn'\\". In particular, Burch realized that she had been using meditation as a way of escaping her pain, meaning that when her pain worsened \\"I felt as if I‚Äôd failed and that I needed to try even harder, only to become even more confused and despondent when the pain persisted. And so the cycle continued, leaving me emotionally barren and desperate.\\" Influenced by the work of Stephen Levine (in particular his work with the dying, as described in his book Who Dies?) and Jon Kabat-Zinn (in particular his work with the chronically ill, as described in Full Catastrophe Living), as well as by the lessons of her own experience, Burch realized that she needed to \\"turn toward the difficult, rather than try to escape it.\\" She also realized that she had to bring mindfulness more fully into her daily life, and was helped in this by pain management practices of \\"pacing\\" and \\"activity management\\". Gradually, Burch's daily life and meditation practice shifted into a mode of \\"acceptance\\", in which, This acceptance helped Burch to experience what she describes as \\"healing towards the human condition\\", with her experience in its wholeness, including her pain and her joys, becoming a point of connection with others, and an opportunity for kindness and empathy.  Breathworks  During the period she was largely housebound, Burch decided to begin teaching others mindful approaches to living with pain and illness, and in 2001 she received a grant from the UK's Millennium Commission to engage in training and begin a pilot class. Burch attended a five-day training event in mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) with Jon Kabat-Zinn at the University of Bangor, and began a weekly \\"Peace of Mind\\" class in Manchester, teaching mindfulness and metta meditations to those suffering from chronic pain. Burch recalls: Those attending the \\"Peace of Mind\\" classes responded positively to them, finding the practices Burch was teaching extremely helpful. In 2002 Burch required major surgery involving the reconstruction of her lower spine, meaning that she was unable to work for around a year. During this time a friend of Burch's called Gary Hennessey (also known by his Buddhist name Ratnaguna) became involved in the \\"Peace of Mind\\" program, as did Burch's partner Sona Fricker. All were members of the Triratna Buddhist Order, and saw Burch's program as a way to help those in need while also providing a means of \\"right livelihood\\". They saw a \\"huge potential\\" in what Burch was doing, but realized that \\"we needed to be more strategic and that the process had to be a lot more rigorous.\\" They decided that in addition to running \\"Peace of Mind\\" courses they would \\"train others to run the courses, eventually creating a community of trainers.\\" In 2004, they co-founded Breathworks and ran their first teacher training retreat, and from this point their work \\"really started to take off\\". After its foundation in 2004 Breathworks grew rapidly, playing a significant part in the development of the UK mindfulness teaching community, and establishing a range of programs and an international presence. Burch's 2002 surgery, along with the new meditation and lifestyle habits she adopted during her time of confinement, improved her health significantly, allowing her to take an active role in steering Breathworks forward, to write, and to travel nationally and internationally to teach. In 2005 Breathworks was a founding member of the UK Network of Mindfulness-Based Teacher Training Organisations (later renamed the British Association of Mindfulness-based Approaches, or BAMBA), and since then has adhered to this organization's Good Practice Guidelines for training mindfulness teachers and delivering courses. (The majority of Breathworks trainers and teachers now come from a very wide range of professions and backgrounds and Breathworks is clear that, while drawing on contemplative training derived from Buddhism, it offers a secular mindfulness pathway appropriate to a wide range of applications.) By 2019 there were almost 500 accredited Breathworks teachers working in 35 countries, and Breathworks had developed programs not only for those with chronic pain and illness (now renamed the Mindfulness for Health course) and for teacher training, but also for those suffering from stress, for people within the workplace, and for those who wish to receive mindfulness training online. Burch is particularly committed to making Breathworks courses available to all regardless of financial hardship, and to this end formed the Breathworks Foundation in 2009. Burch has formalized the Breathworks approach to mindfulness for those with pain and illness, as taught in the Mindfulness for Health course, under the name mindfulness-based pain management (MBPM). Adapting the core concepts and practices of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), MBPM integrates a pacing program into the course, and includes a distinctive emphasis on the concepts of \\"primary\\" and \\"secondary\\" suffering, and on the practice of \\"loving-kindness\\". Utilizing a \\"six-step process\\" oriented towards the cultivation of qualities such as awareness, acceptance, sympathetic joy, equanimity, loving-kindness, and choice, MBPM has been seen as sensitive to concerns about the dangers of removing mindfulness teaching from its original ethical framework within Buddhism, while also providing a secular evidence- based approach appropriate for people of all faiths, and none. Burch has published on MBPM in academic forums, and the approach has been subject to a range of clinical studies demonstrating its effectiveness.  Other activities  Other than for her work with Breathworks, Burch is probably best known for her writings, and in particular for the three books she has published. Burch's first book - Living Well with Pain and Illness: the Mindful Way to Free Yourself from Suffering - was published in 2008, and presented the Breathworks program in a way that aimed to be accessible but was also theoretically subtle, laying out the philosophical underpinnings of the program and the ways that it related to Buddhism. The book also narrated Burch's own story and the stories of others who had benefited from the Breathworks program. Burch's second book - Mindfulness for Health: A Practical Guide to Relieving Pain, Reducing Stress and Restoring Wellbeing (2013) - was aimed at a broader audience than Living Well with Pain and Illness, including those with a lower level of literacy. Written with the journalist Danny Penman, it presented the Breathworks program in a clear, easy-to-follow way. Both books have been translated into more than a dozen languages, and Mindfulness for Health won the British Medical Association's 2014 Medical Books Award in the Popular Medicine category. In 2016, Burch published Mindfulness for Women: Declutter Your Mind, Simplify Your Life, Find Time to ‚ÄòBe‚Äô with the magazine editor Claire Irvin, which addressed how mindfulness can be helpful in the context of the pressures affecting many modern women. Burch has also taken an active role in promoting mindfulness and meditation both within the UK and internationally. She participated in the UK Parliament's All-Party Parliamentary Group on Mindfulness, which produced the 2015 \\"Mindful Nation UK\\" report recommending increased provision of mindfulness-based treatments for physical and mental health conditions.

She was the daughter of Adolph Ochs, wife of Arthur Hays Sulzberger, mother of Arthur Ochs \\"Punch\\" Sulzberger, paternal grandmother of Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., and patrilineal great-grandmother of A. G. Sulzberger, who all served as publishers of the paper.  Biography  Iphigene Bertha Ochs was born on September 19, 1892 as the only child of Adolph Simon Ochs and Iphigenia (Wise) Ochs. Her father was then the publisher of The Chattanooga Times, and her mother was a daughter of Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise, founder of Reform Judaism. When Adolph purchased The New York Times in 1896, she moved with her parents to New York City. After being educated at private schools, including Sachs's School for Girls (that later became the Dwight School), she entered Barnard College in 1910 and graduated in 1914 with majors in economics and American and European history. At Barnard, she met briefly with Arthur Hays Sulzberger, son of cotton merchant Cyrus Leopold Sulzberger. After college, she was reintroduced to him by her cousin, Julius Ochs Adler, who trained with Sulzberger in the military in Plattsburgh, New York. The two fell in love and were married on Nov. 17, 1917. Her husband joined The New York Times in 1918, while she spent the early years rearing her family. She gave birth to Marian Sulzberger Heiskell in 1918, Ruth Sulzberger Holmberg in 1921, Judith Sulzberger in 1923, and Arthur Ochs \\"Punch\\" Sulzberger in 1926. Following her father's death in 1935, she became a trustee of The New York Times under his will as well as one of the three trustees of his estate that had a controlling stake in it. However, she was deemed ineligible to inherit the newspaper because of her gender. Her husband was elected publisher the same year. As the publisher's wife, her role in the operations of the newspaper was described as one that often remained offstage but nonetheless vital, because as the family matriarch and the only offspring of Adolph Ochs, she exerted maintain the familial unity necessary to jointly run a business and avoid any feuds. Under her stewardship, the newspaper survived many challenges to the industry and remained one of the most prestigious and respected news organizations as well as a leading source of international news. She played a role in helping her husband manage the newspaper after he was enfeebled by a stroke in his later years. Her son-in- law, Orvil Dryfoos, succeeded him from 1961 to 1963, until he died of heart failure at 50. He was succeeded by his brother-in-law and Sulzberger's only son Punch, who served as publisher from 1963 to 1992. Sulzberger served as a director of The New York Times from 1917 to 1973, when she became director emeritus.  Philanthropy  Sulzberger was known for her philanthropic activities. She was the president of the New York Park Association from 1928 to 1950. She was also a founding member of the Central Park Conservancy and helped to preserve and restore Central Park. She also became a benefactor to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, of which her son served as trustee since 1968, and chairman from 1987 to 1998. Sulzberger served on the board of trustees of Barnard College from 1937 to 1968 and helped with fundraising of the women's college. A dormitory building and a parlor in Barnard College are named in her honor. She was also a trustee of the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion and the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga.  Family and Personal Life  Sulzberger passed away in her sleep at age ninety-seven on February 26, 1990. At the time of her death, she was survived by four children, 13 grandchildren, and 24 great-grandchildren. Her funeral at Congregation Emanu-El of New York was attended by well over a thousand people, including New York City mayor David Dinkins and former mayors Ed Koch and John Lindsay, Senators Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Abraham Ribicoff, former United States Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, Brown University president Vartan Gregorian, Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham, and President of Museum of Modern Art William Luers. Her first daughter, Marian, a director of the newspaper, married Andrew Heiskell, chairman of Time Inc. after her husband Orvil Dryfoos passed away. Her second daughter, Ruth, was a publisher of Chattanooga Times Free Press. Ruth's son, Arthur Golden, is a novelist who wrote bestselling novel Memoirs of a Geisha. Her other son, Michael Golden, is currently vice chairman of The New York Times Company and former publisher of the International herald Tribune. Holmberg's son-in-law, Edward Dolnick is a novelist as is her grandson, Ben Dolnick. Her other grandson, Sam Dolnick, is an assistant managing editor of The New York Times and was one of the candidates to succeed Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr. as the next publisher. Her third daughter, Judith, became a physician. Her only son, Punch, served as publisher of the newspaper from 1963 to 1992. His son, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr. remains the Chairman of The New York Times Company, a post he assumed in 1997. Arthur Jr.'s son A. G. Sulzberger became the publisher on January 1, 2018. Punch's other grandson, David Perpich, served as a senior vice president in the company and oversees its standalone products. He was another one of the candidates to be the next publisher of the newspaper, along with A. G. Sulzberger and Sam Dolnick.

The league's inaugural season debuted on June 1, 2019, and included a 14-week tour-based schedule taking place in 12 major-market cities. NBC Sports (2019‚Äìpresent) In October 2018, the PLL and NBC jointly announced that the NBC Sports Group got exclusive rights to broadcast the league's 14-week season on its broadcast and cable networks, including 10 regular-season weekends, an All-Star weekend and two playoff weekends concluding with the title game on September 21. More specifically, NBC's broadcast network would air three PLL games, with NBCSN airing 16 more and the other 20 available through an NBC Sports Gold package. In May 2019, NBC announced that pre-game, halftime, and postgame host Paul Burmeister, play-by-play voice Brendan Burke, and analyst Ryan Boyle would be their first-ever commentators during the PLL's inaugural season. Joining them would be Chantel McCabe, who would serve as a reporter at various times throughout the season. Production innovations that NBC would bring included in-game player-to-commentator communication, SMT Shot Speed tracking technology, Skycam on multiple games, miked-up players and coaches ‚Äî and the use of players as commentators throughout the season. As for player- to-commentator communication, this means that the two players on the field, focusing on the goalie and attack positions, would be able to communicate with the NBC Sports PLL broadcast team. Meanwhile, NBC Sports installed an array of sensors at each end of the field for each PLL game to track shot speed from a variety of angles, using SMT's lacrosse intelligence engine to provide real- time speed tracking. On May 6, 2020, the PLL announced a two-week quarantined and fanless tournament called the PLL Championship Series to be scheduled to run from July 25-August 9.

Topics An introductory chapter classifies tables broadly according to whether they are intended as aids to calculation (based on mathematical formulas) or as analyses and records of data, and further subdivides them according to how they were compiled. Following this, the contributions to the book include articles on the following topics: *Tables of data in Babylonian mathematics, administration, and astronomy, by Eleanor Robson *Early tables of logarithms, by Graham Jagger *Life tables in actuarial science, by Christopher Lewin and Margaret de Valois *The work of Gaspard de Prony constructing mathematical tables in revolutionary France, by Ivor Grattan-Guinness *Difference engines, by Michael Williams *The uses and advantages of machines in table-making, and error correction in mechanical tables, by Doron Swade *Astronomical tables, by Arthur Norberg *The data processing and statistical analyses used to produce tables of census data from punched cards, by Edward Higgs *British table- making committees, and the transition from calculators to computers, by Mary Croarken *The Mathematical Tables Project of the Works Progress Administration, in New York during the Great Depression of the 1930s and early 1940s, by David Alan Grier *The work of the British Nautical Almanac Office, by George A.

The work is presented on VIII + 361 pages in a unified format with illustrations throughout, and with the historical and biographical context of the material set aside in separate text boxes. Audience and reception Reviewer Paul J. Campbell finds it ironic that, unlike the works it discusses, \\"there are no tables in the back of the book\\". Reviewer Sandy L. Zabell calls the book \\"interesting and highly readable\\". Both Peggy A. Kidwell and Fernando Q. Gouv√™a note several topics that would have been worthwhile to include, including tables in mathematics in medieval Islam or other non-Western cultures, the book printing industry that provided inexpensive books of tables in the 19th century, and the development of mathematical tables in Germany. As Kidwell writes, \\"like most good books, this one not only tells good stories, but leaves the reader hoping to learn more\\". Gouv√™a evaluates the book as being useful in its coverage of a topic often missed in broader surveys of the history of mathematics, of interest both to historians of mathematics and to a more general audience interested in the development of these topics, and \\"a must-have for libraries\\".

It is also called as ‡§Æ‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Æ. More information and importance of Madhyama The following is the information about Madhyama and its importance in Indian classical music: * Madhyama is the fourth svara in an octave or Saptak. * Ma is the immediate next svara of GƒÅndhƒÅra (Ga). * The svara of Madhyama is Tivra and Shuddha. In fact Madhyama is the only Tivra svara in the Saptak. * It is said that Sadja is the basic svara from which all the other 6 svaras are produced. When we break the word Sadja then we get, Shad And Ja. It means that Shad is 6 and ja is 'giving birth' in Marathi.https://saxonianfolkways.wordpress.com/2013/01/30/the-7-shadows-of- shadja So basically the translation is : ‡§∑‡§°‡•ç - 6, ‡§ú -‡§ú‡§®‡•ç‡§Æ . Therefore, it collectively means giving birth to the other 6 notes of the music. So the svara Ma is formed from Sadja. * The frequency of Madhyama is 320 Hz. The frequencies of the 7 svaras are also given below: Sa 240 Hz, Re 270 Hz, Ga 300 Hz, Ma 320 Hz, Pa 360 Hz, Dha 400 Hz, and Ni 450 Hz, Sa 480 Hz (Taar Saptak) ........ (and so on). Consequently, the Ma after the Ga of 600 Hz (Taar Saptak) has a frequency of 640 Hz i.e. the double of the Lower octave Ma. * There are 4 Shruti's of Madhyama. Previously the main Shruti not only for Ma but for all the other svaras was on the last Shruti but now it is considered to be on the 1st Shurti. For example if these are the 4 Shruti's of Ma then, Previously this was the position of the main Shruti of Ma. ^ 1 2 3 4 ^ But now this position has become the main Shruti of Ma. * All the other svaras except Sadja(Sa) and Pancham (Pa) can be Komal or Tivra svaras but Sa and Pa are always Shuddha svaras. And hence svaras Sa and Pa are called Achal Svaras , since these svaras don't move from their original position. Svaras Ra, Ga, Ma, Dha, Ni are called Chal Svaras, since these svaras move from their original position. Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni - Shuddha Svaras Re, Ga, Dha, Ni - Komal Svaras Ma - Tivra Svaras Ma is a Shuddha Svara as well as a Tivra Svara. But Ma is the only Tivra Svara. This is denoted as ‡§Æ‡•ì . * Ragas from Kalyan Thaat, Poorvi Thaat, Marwa Thaat, Todi Thaat have Tivra Madhyama. * Ragas where Ma is the Vadi svara - Raga Kedar, etc. Ragas where Ma is the Samvadi svara - Raga Malkauns. * Hypothetically speaking, Ma is said to be the Mahipal - Lord Indra, Mahipal as in, the three main gods, Bhrama, Vishnu and Shiva were first created i.e. Sakar Bhrama (Sa) and then these three gods created Rishimuni i.e. Re and then Gandharvas were created for singing and then lord Indra or Raja Indra i.e. Mahipal was created.

Tansey is an American Physiologist and Neuroscientist as well as the Director of the Center for Translational Research in Neurodegenerative Disease at the University of Florida. Tansey holds the titles of Evelyn F. and William L. McKnight Brain Investigator and Norman Fixel Institute for Neurological Diseases Investigator. As the principal investigator of the Tansey Lab, Tansey guides a research program centered around investigating the role of neuroimmune interactions in the development and progression of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disease. Tansey's work is primarily focused on exploring the cellular and molecular basis of peripheral and central inflammation in the pathology of age-related neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's DIsease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  Early life and education  In 1980, Tansey pursued her undergraduate education at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. She completed her Bachelors in Biological Sciences and then stayed at Stanford to complete her Master's in Biological Sciences as well. After graduating in 1985, Tansey pursued her graduate studies in Physiology and Cell Cycle Regulation at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Under the mentorship of James T. Stull, Tansey explored the role of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) phosphorylation in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction. Tansey found, early on in her PhD, that cellular mechanisms other than myosin light chain phosphorylation regulate contractile tension in smooth muscle cells. She later found that calcium dependent phosphorylation of MLCK in smooth muscle lead to decreased calcium sensitivity of phosphorylated myosin light chains. Tansey also proposed a model to understand the regulation of myosin light chain kinase phosphorylation by limited calmodulin availability. Following the completion of her graduate studies in 1992, Tansey moved to Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, where she worked under the mentorship of Eugene M. Johnson in the Department of Molecular Pharmacology. Tansey first explored the mechanisms of neuronal survival in cerebellar granule cells. She and her team knew that depolarizing concentrations of potassium promoted survival, so they asked whether the downstream effects of potassium influx on survival were mediated by MAP kinase or PI-3-K. They found that survival was dependent on depolarization induced PI-3-K activity. Tansey then collaborated with Jeff Milbrandt's lab in the Department of Genetics at WashU to explore the GDNF family of ligands and the biology of their intracellular signalling. The GDNF family of ligands (GFL) are neurotrophic factors found to be important in neuron survival, so Tansey and her colleagues probed the critical intracellular signalling component of the GFL receptor system, the receptor tyrosine kinase RET. They found that in order for proper RET function and thus proper GFL signalling, RET needed to be interacting with a GPI-linked co- receptor associated with a lipid raft in order for proper functioning. They further found that RET associates with members of the Src family kinases and that interaction and signalling through Src is instrumental in mediating the downstream effects of GFLs.  Career and research  After completing her postdoctoral work, Tansey then moved to California to work in industry for a few years as the group leader of Chemical Genetics at Zencor Inc. in Monrovia. Her work focused on developing tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors. Tansey then returned to academia in 2002 and became an assistant professor of physiology at the University of Texas Southwestern. At UT Southwestern, Tansey continued to study the role of the cytokine TNF in CNS signalling and disease. In 2008, Tansey was recruited to become an associate professor at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. Tansey became a tenured professor at Emory University, a member of the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease, and the Senior Director of Graduate Studies in Neuroscience. As a Hispanic-American, Tansey worked to increase diversity and inclusion at Emory through her role as the Director of the Emory Initiative for Maximizing Student Development. In 2019, Tansey was recruited to the University of Florida to become the director of the Center for Translational Research in Neurodegenerative Disease. Tansey also holds the titles of Evelyn F, and William L McKnight Brain Investigator and Norman Fixel Institute for Neurological Diseases Investigator. In addition to her leadership roles at UF, Tansey is also on the Board of Directors for the World Parkinson's Coalition. The Tansey Lab explores the interactions between the nervous and immune systems in the context of health and disease. Tansey specifically focuses on the role of TNF in neuroinflammation and the context of Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease. Tansey also explores the roles of microglia and brain macrophages in neurological disease pathogenesis as well as how gene-environment interactions interface with chronic inflammatory states to predispose and perpetuate diseases of the central nervous system. = Tumor necrosis factor signalling in disease = Tansey has been dedicated to exploring the role of TNF in disease and following the potential to inhibit its actions to ameliorate pathological inflammation in disease. Since TNF had been implicated in pathology, Tansey explored a method to sequester TNF in vivo to act as an inhibitor of TNF function. Tansey and her team developed a variant TNF protein that formed heterodimers with TNF in vivo rendering TNF unable to signal through TNF receptors. They found that this appeared to abrogate TNF pathology in animal models. Using this innovative TNF variant, Tansey and her team were able to probe the role of TNF in Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease. They found that when they blocked TNF signalling using the variant TNF technology, they were able to attenuate progressive pathology and even reduce microglial activation, which was associated with the loss of dopamine neurons in PD. These findings suggested that targeting TNF might be a promising strategy to prevent the loss of dopamine neurons in PD and also prevent prevent neuronal pathology on AD. = Chronic inflammation and neurodegeneration = Tansey is a pioneer in the exploration of how chronic inflammation predisposes and perpetuates neurological disease. Contrary to previous reports, the immune system does exist in the central nervous system, and the major orchestrators of this immune response are the innate immune cells of the brain called microglia. Short term activation of inflammation in the brain is present in disease, injury, or infection, and is useful in response to disease states, but if this inflammation is prolonged, it can lead to neuronal death. Tansey has helped to educate the field on the concept of acute versus chronic brain inflammation, the purposes and roles of this inflammation, and its relation to chronic neurological diseases. She emphasizes that microglia lie at a convergence point where stimuli can impact microglial activation and thus lead to aberrant brain inflammation and neuronal death in this way. Tansey showed that the microglial GTPase RGS10 might play a protective role in a chronic inflammatory environment. When RGS10 was knocked out in mice with chronic systemic inflammation, it led to overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines by microglia and death of dopaminergic neurons. Since removal of RGS10 in dopaminergic neurons also made them more sensitive to the proinflammatory cytokines released by microglia, Tansey proposed RGS10 as a therapeutic target for PD. Tansey also explores the role of gene-environment interactions, or epigenetic mechanisms in neurodegenerative disease pathology and chronic inflammation. She probed how diet effects immune infiltration into the brain since previous studies had showed that it might lead to compromised blood brain barrier function and increased immune cell infiltration into the CNS. Conversely, her findings showed that high fat high fructose diets did not increase peripheral trafficking of immune cells into the CNS. Tansey also explored the sex-specific effects of stress on neuro-immune reactivity and found that early life chronic stress led to increased neuro-immune reactivity but via different mechanisms in male versus female rats.

He was Bolivia's Minister of the Interior from August 6, 1989 to March 15, 1991 during the government of President Jaime Paz Zamora and was also Bolivia's Minister of Housing and Urban Development from April 13, 1984 to January 10, 1985 during the second government of President Hern√°n Siles Suazo.  Biography  He was born on June 6, 1945 in the town of Concepci√≥n, which is located in the Province √ëuflo de Chaves in the Department of Santa Cruz. Ribera graduated in 1963 from Colegio Florida in the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra. He continued with his higher studies, entering to study law at the Universidad Aut√≥noma Gabriel Ren√© Moreno (UAGRM), graduating as a lawyer. During his university years he was the executive secretary of the Local University Federation (FUL). He began his youth leadership in Christian democracy in the late 1960s, starting his militancy in the ranks of the party of the Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR). While the MIR was being founded, he was studying communication in Europe at the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium. He returned to Bolivia in the late 1970s where he became the main leader of the MIR in the Department of Santa Cruz, which at the time was a less than left-wing department.3 He died on 12 May 2020 at the age of seventy- four.  1978 National Elections  He entered the country's political life at the age of thirty-three in 1978. That year he participated as a candidate for deputy in the national elections, but those elections were annulled due to proven fraud.  Member of Parliament of Bolivia from 1979-1980  The following year, in 1979, he again participated as a candidate for the post of deputy for the Department of Santa Cruz representing the Unidad Democr√°tica y Popular (UDP). But the quagmire of those elections in Congress forced the government of President Lidia Gueiler Tejada to call new general elections to be held in June 1980.  Deputy of Bolivia 1980-1985  He returned to participate in the 1980 election where he managed to get elected as a deputy by the UDP, but was imprisoned by the government of Luis Garc√≠a Meza and exiled abroad. He returned to Bolivia with the recovery of democracy in 1982 and took up his position as a parliamentarian.  Minister of Housing and Urban Development of Bolivia (1984-1985)  On April 13, 1984, he was sworn in as Bolivia's Minister of Housing and Urban Development to replace Walter Delgadillo Terceros, who had resigned. He remained in office until January 10, 1985, when he was replaced by Emilio Ascarrunz Paredes.4  Member of Parliament of Bolivia 1985-1989  He again ran for re-election as a deputy for the Department of Santa Cruz, but this time he did so representing the party of the Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR). He managed to win the parliamentary seat by remaining in office from August 6, 1985 to August 6, 1989.  1987 Municipal Elections  He also participated in the 1987 municipal elections, running for mayor of Santa Cruz de la Sierra on behalf of the MIR, but was unsuccessful after coming in second place.  1989 National Elections  In 1989, he again participated in the national elections of that same year, as a senator for the Department of Santa Cruz for the MIR, but this time he was not successful either.  Minister of the Interior of Bolivia (1989-1991)  On August 6, 1989, Bolivian President Jaime Paz Zamora appointed Guillermo Capobianco as the new Minister of the Interior of Bolivia to replace Eduardo P√©rez Beltr√°n, who was in the previous government of V√≠ctor Paz Estenssoro. During his term as minister, he managed to dismantle the terrorist group Comisi√≥n N√©stor Paz Zamora (CNPZ) and the Tupac Katari Guerrilla Army (EGTK), which at the time was made up of Felipe Quispe \\"El Mallku\\" (1942) and Alvaro Garcia Linera (1962).  Lonsdale case  In June 1990, private businessman Jorge Lonsdale (1930-1990) was kidnapped by the terrorist group Nestor Paz Zamora Commission (CNP) led by Miguel Northuster (1961-1990), an Italian originally from South Tyrol. On December 5 of that same year, the Bolivian police stormed the house where Jorge Lonsdale was kidnapped. The result of the police operation ended with the death of the kidnapping terrorists and the kidnapped businessman. Public opinion in the country described the police operation as a failure and the Ministry of the Interior was accused of having used unnecessary violence in addition to the murder of all the kidnappers. In 1991, Ribera appointed former Army General Faustino Rico Toro to the post of anti-narcotics director. This decision caused discomfort at the U.S. Embassy in Bolivia, which asked for his resignation as interior minister, so he was forced to resign his post on March 15, 1991, and was replaced by Carlos Saavedra Buno.

Biography Hecht was born in Ansbach, Bavaria. He studied the art of wood engraving with the printmaker D√∂ring in Nuremberg from 1857 to 1859, continued his education in larger studios in Leipzig, Berlin and Stuttgart, and in 1868 opened his own studio in Munich. In 1885 he was called to Vienna to head the newly founded xylographic department of the k.u.k. Hof- und Staatsdruckerei (Imperial and Royal State Printing Office). At the same time, he was made professor for wood engraving at the School for Applied Arts (Kunstgewerbeschule), now the Universit√§t f√ºr angewandte Kunst Wien (University of Applied Arts Vienna). He retired to Graz, then to Munich, and in 1912 to Linz, where he died. Hecht applied his talent and skills particularly to copy-engraving. He was assigned by the Society for Reproducing Art (Gesellschaft f√ºr vervielf√§ltigende Kunst) in Vienna to execute several woodcuts of paintings in the Schack Gallery in Munich, leading him to devote his talents to etching, which thereafter became the almost sole focus of his artistic production. He completed etchings of works by Schwind, B√∂cklin, Lenbach, Rottmann, Schleich, van Dyck und Jan van Schorel ‚Äì works of art in their own right - and produced two original etchings (Emperor Wilhelm I and King Ludwig of Bavaria in the regalia of the Order of St. George, the latter in an unusual format size).

History  The formation of the Gotse Delchev Brigade started in Sofia after the pro-Soviet coup on September 9, 1944. Then the Bulgarian participation in the war switched against the Third Reich. Its official beginning dates back to September 14, when a decree of the Council of Ministers of the new Fatherland Front Government was adopted for this purpose. According to the order of the General Command, the brigade must act together with the Bulgarian Army. It was urgently equipped, armed and involved in hostilities, and was constantly supplemented with new additions. Petar Traykov was appointed commander. After negotiations with the Yugoslav partisans, it was decided the brigade to be turned over to their command.Michael Palairet, Macedonia: A Voyage through History, Volume 2, Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2016; , p. 212. Initially, it consisted of 4,600 people and was composed of soldiers from Vardar Macedonia who served in the Bulgarian Army during 1941-1944, when the area was under Bulgarian control. Its first battalion was sent to the front in Vardar Macedonia on September 30, and the second on October 7. The Bigade set up and equipped by the Bulgarian government provided the basis for the deployment of considerable troops in Vardar Macedonia. By order of the General Staff of the Macedonian Partisans, the brigade was assigned to the newly formed partisan Bregalnica-Strumica Corps. The only more substantial changes other than renaming were the joining of few hundred guerrillas. At that time some hostilities continued between the Bulgarian army and the Yugoslav partisans. They arose from previous period when Bulgaria had occupied parts from Yugoslavia. As result by order of Svetozar Vukmanovic-Tempo, the initial composition of the Brigade's Headquarters was changed to local people without military education. The Montenegrin Serb Tempo was Josip Broz Tito's personal envoy in Vardar Macedonia. The name of the Brigade Gotse Delchev had also been removed. The Bulgarian epaulets of the officers were removed too, but without being replaced by other distinctive signs. This suppressed the officers who received their ranks in the Bulgarian Army.–ü–µ—Ç—ä—Ä –®–∞–Ω–¥–∞–Ω–æ–≤, ‚Äû–ë–æ–≥–∞—Ç—Å—Ç–≤–æ—Ç–æ –º–∏ –µ —Å–≤–æ–±–æ–¥–∞—Ç–∞‚Äú, –ò–ö –ì—É—Ç–µ–Ω–±–µ—Ä–≥, 2010, , —Å—Ç—Ä. 326-330.

The mountain is situated in Glacier Peak Wilderness of the North Cascades, on land managed by Wenatchee National Forest. Fred Beckey's Cascade Alpine Guide has the elevation of the highest pinnacle as 8,402 feet. Pinnacle Mountain ranks as the fourth-highest peak in the Chelan Mountains, and 75th-highest summit in Washington state. Its nearest higher neighbor is Saska Peak, to the southeast, and Emerald Peak is positioned to the east-southeast. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into the Entiat River and Chelan River drainage basins. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Geology West aspect, from Mt. Maude Pinnacle Mountain is composed primarily of granodiorite and hornblende quartz diorite, minerals of the Cardinal Peak pluton. The North Cascades feature some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences.The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. Glacier Peak, a stratovolcano that is west of Saska Peak, began forming in the mid- Pleistocene.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago.During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

The Bolsheviks had stolen his church funds, including a fund he held for British people who were destitute in Moscow, and also his silver. Finally, they had stolen Mrs. North's jewels. The other Britons travelling with him had come safely home, determined to overcome any obstacle rather than endure any longer the misgovernment of the Soviets. On 24 May 1920, The Times published an interview with North, in which he continued his critique of the situation in Russia and his views on the Bolsheviks.Gleanings and Memoranda, Volume 52 (National Unionist Association, 1920), p. 52 The Spectator of 29 May 1920 also carried a story about North's experiences in Russia.The Spectator, 29 May 1920, p. 2 In June 1920, North poured scorn on George Lansbury, who had returned from Moscow with some favourable views of the Bolsheviks. North said that in Moscow Lansbury had been dependent on a Commissar called Joseph Fineberg, of whom he was also very critical.Patrick Wright, Iron Curtain: From Stage to Cold War (2007, ), p. 421 (note 83) The Morning Post reported North's disagreement with Lansbury and his experience in a Bolshevik jail, of which it said \\"The facts are too revolting for reproduction\\".\\"Mr. Lansbury given the Lie Direct\\", in Morning Post, 14 June 1920, p. 7 At the time of the voyage of the Dongola, Margaret North was pregnant, and she gave birth to a daughter, Geraldine, on 22 September 1920.National Registration Act 1939, Register for Hampstead, Belsize Park, October 1939, at ancestry.co.uk : \\"North, Margaret C., F., 30 Sept 1879, W., No occupation; North, Geraldine F., F., 22 Sept 1920, S., Librarian\\" Within a few months, North and family returned to Finland and settled there, and he was appointed as Anglican Chaplain to Helsingfors.

Except during the First World War, the ship's main use was as a passenger liner on the routes from England through the Suez Canal to India and the Far East, and she was fast enough to carry mail. P & O sold the ship in June 1926 to be broken up for scrap.

The ship's dimensions were: length 470 feet; beam 56 feet 3 inches; draught 27 feet 8 inches; gross tonnage 8038; net tonnage 4723.

Dongola had a twin-screw steam- powered quadruple-expansion engine, also built by Barclay, Curle and Co., generating 1,252 nominal horsepower and giving the ship a top speed of 15.5 knots. As built, she had accommodation for 243 passengers, 163 in First Class cabins and 80 in Second Class, and had a cargo capacity of 13,189 cubic yards. The ship was designed to be crewed by 236 officers and men, 61 on deck, 91 in the engine room, and 84 in the purser's department.

Company.\\" In 1907, she made a record speed from Southampton to Bombay, completing the voyage in eighteen days and seven hours. Seasonal trooping work was repeated every year until 1910, and in June 1911 the ship took part in King George V's Coronation Review of the Fleet, carrying Admiralty guests. Also in 1911, Dongola was used for Indian famine relief. Trooping charter work was repeated every summer from 1912 to 1914. Wartime hospital and troop ship The ship was under charter and carrying troops when the British Empire declared war on Germany on 4 August 1914. Espagne, rammed by Dongola in 1915 At 10.47 pm on 4 March 1915, Dongola sailed from Avonmouth, and at 00.17 on 5 March she collided with the Belgian steamer Espagne, which was lying at anchor in the Bristol Channel. With a hole below the waterline, on the starboard side at the bow, Dongola was taking in water and was beached near Barry, South Wales, for the hole to be patched. At 4.48 am, the rising tide began to lift the ship, and she was winched into Barry Docks at about 8 am. On 17 March, she steamed back to sea, after repairs. In 1915, Dongola was requisitioned until further notice and served as a temporary hospital ship in the Dardanelles during the Gallipoli campaign of 1915 to 1916. She then returned to use as a troop transport, largely along the coast of East Africa. Baltic voyages In 1919, Dongola remained requisitioned. The fighting with Germany had been ended by the Armistice of 11 November 1918, but throughout 1919 the Russian Civil War continued to rage, with some British (and Allied) intervention on behalf of the Whites. There was a state of undeclared war between Britain and the Bolsheviks, but in November 1919 Lloyd George began a process of coming to terms with the Soviet Union, and negotiations began in Copenhagen between the British and the Soviets. One of the issues was an exchange of prisoners and others wishing to return home, and an Agreement to this end was signed on 12 February 1920.Nikolai Tolstoy, The Tolstoys (Hamish Hamilton, 1983), p. 338 Dongola was used to repatriate Russians from Great Britain to Reval in the Baltic, some of whom were being deported, and on 14 May 1920 she went on to Helsingfors in Finland to bring back people escaping from the Russian Civil War. On 18 May, the ship arrived in Copenhagen, and the British press reported that she had on board 356 passengers released from Russia, some two hundred of them British subjects, including fifteen officers, together with 117 French civilians and 27 Danes.\\"BRITISH SUBJECTS RETURNING FROM RUSSIA\\" in Aberdeen Press and Journal, Tuesday 18 May 1920, p. 5: \\"The steamer Dongola arrived Copenhagen this morning from Finland with 356 persons on board, released from Russia.

Those on board included the Rev. F. W. North, Anglican Chaplain in Moscow and his wife, the Russian jeweller Alexander Julius Faberg√©, the eight-year-old half-British Dimitry Tolstoy, accompanied by his nurse, Lucy Stark, and Elijah Egmore, a butler. At Copenhagen, Dongola had taken on board several new passengers. Return to P & O After her Baltic journeys, Dongola was returned to P & O and was refitted for commercial work. In October 1920 she made her first such voyage from the Port of London to Bombay. On 20 May 1922, the ship had a severe collision at speed in fog off Woosung, China with the Japanese ship Kumana Manu , whose officers were blamed for the incident. Dongola was beached but Kumana Maru continued her voyage. Both vessels had to go into dock for repairs.

Griffin RNR, later reported to P & O in London: Yokohama after the earthquake A large ship, the Lyons Maru, passed Dongola heading for open water and touched her bow plates, but did no damage. A burning lighter then hit the ship and sank, and about twelve of the crew were hauled on board, with another twelve drowning. By 5 p.m. the wind had died away and three boats were sent out to rescue survivors. They made several trips until after midnight, picking up more than 250 people, some badly injured. At daylight the boats were sent off again and more survivors rescued. By 9.40 a.m. on 2 September Griffin was worried by \\"large quantities of floating oil blazing furiously and drifting in various parts of the harbor\\", so he took his ship outside the breakwater. A steam launch then came out with more survivors. By 7 p.m. about 600 were on board, mainly Japanese, Russians, and Chinese. Some were transferred to other ships, and Dongola then steamed to Kobe with 505 passengers on board. One woman and one child died on the voyage and were buried at sea. The larger and newer Canadian Pacific liner RMS Empress of Australia had also been in Yokohama harbour at the time of the earthquake, and her captain recorded in the ship's log: \\"The vessel shook all over in a most terrifying fashion, and also rocked very quickly and violently until it seemed as though the masts and funnels must carry away.\\" A long wharf beside the ship simply vanished. Empress of Australia also rescued many survivors.Anne Park Shannon, \\"Our History: Empress a witness to disaster\\" in Times Colonist, 8 March 2015, at timescolonist.com, accessed 10 May 2020 On 5 September, the British press reported that Dongola and all of her crew were safe and had taken aboard many injured and homeless. On 28 December 1923, Commander Griffin was appointed OBE, and the master of the Empress of Australia, already an OBE, was promoted to CBE.The London Gazette, Issue 32892, 28 December 1923, p. 9105 Griffin also received a Japanese decoration. Final years Farm Cove, NSW, Australia, 1925 In 1924, Dongola was providing a passenger service between Aden and Bombay, and in 1925 made a round trip from England to Australia and back. On 28 June 1926, P & O sold the ship to T. W. Ward Ltd. for demolition at Barrow- in-Furness, the price paid being ¬£15,500.

His special field was anti-Semitic public relations, especially in connection with trials abroad, which could be exploited for propaganda purposes. He also played an essential role in the preparation of a show trial against Herschel Grynszpan, whose assassination attempt on a German embassy employee in Paris had been used by the Nazis as a trigger for the November pogroms in 1938. In 1941, his pamphlets on the so- called Kaufman Plan and the Soviet Union were published in print runs of millions. After the war, Diewerge managed to re-enter politics via the FDP North Rhine-Westphalia. However, the intervention of the British occupation authorities and a commission of the FDP's Federal Executive Committee put an abrupt end to this intermezzo. In 1966 Diewerge was convicted of perjury for his statements made under oath about the Grynszpan trial planned by the National Socialists. After all, he was involved in the Flick donations affair as managing director of two associations.  Origin and early years  Diewerge's father was Wilhelm Diewerge, a Stettin secondary school teacher and later school principal in Stargard in Pomerania; his mother's name was Hedwig, n√©e Grell. Wolfgang Diewerge had a three years younger brother, Heinz Diewerge, who during the Nazi regime made a career as a folklorist, teacher trainer and member of the party's official examination commission for the protection of Nazi literature; Heinz Diewerge died in 1939 from a war injury he sustained during the Polish campaign.Otto Hofmann, Hinrich Siuts (ed.): Das Gr√∂ningsche Gymnasium zu Stargard in Pommern. Eine Schulgeschichte. Essen 1981, S. 131. Stargard ILO2 Wolfgang Diewerge attended the traditional Gr√∂ning grammar school in Stargard and passed his school-leaving examination there in 1924 Afterwards he studied law in Jena and Berlin. He passed the first state examination in law in 1929, followed by a legal clerkship at the Kammergericht in Berlin, with a stay abroad of several months as a court clerk at the German consular court in Cairo and with the German lawyer Felix Dahm, who was admitted to the Mixed Court there. In spring 1933 Diewerge applied for an abbreviation of the state examination in law, and in November of the same year he finally passed his assessor examination.Information on legal training according to Fuhrer 2012, p. 82 f., which uses files from documents on Diewerge in the Berlin Document Center. Politically orientated, Diewergs early on aligned themselves with ethnic and Nazi groups. According to his own statements, he became a member of the Schlageter-Ged√§chtnisbund (Schlageter Memorial Association) in October 1923, i.e. while still a schoolboy, and joined the Black Army in August 1924 in Leipzig. Since 1927, he occasionally wrote for Nazi newspapers and magazines, such as the Angriff, the V√∂lkischer Beobachter, the Westdeutsche Beobachter, the National Socialist Monatshefte and the anti-Semitic satirical magazine Die Brennessel. August 1930 he joined the NSDAP (membership number 278.234); he is said to have been a member of the NSDAP earlier under the alias Diege. Even before 1933 Diewerge held various party offices in Berlin, from district propaganda officer to training officer to deputy local group leader. In addition, he made his legal knowledge available to various Nazi organizations, such as the Gaurechtsstelle Berlin of the NSDAP and the prisoner care of the SA, and appeared as a Gauredner.Fuhrer 2012, p. 82 f., with reference to information provided by Diewerge in his application to shorten the state examination.  Nazi propagandist  In 1933 Diewerge became the Reich's managing director of the German Gymnastics Association and celebrated the Stuttgart Gymnastics Festival, which took place at the end of July, as a \\"folk festival in the National Socialist sense\\" in which \\"true national and destiny community\\" manifested itself In this year he also became head of the legal department of the \\"National Socialist Fighting League for Small and Medium-Sized Businesses - Gau Gro√ü-Berlin\\". Diewerge was also a department head in the NSDAP foreign organization. In early 1934 he made his first public appearance. The occasion was a highly politicized trial in Cairo - the Egyptian capital was already familiar to him from his traineeship.Horkenbach 1935, p. 931 The biographical information there goes back to Diewerge's own communications, as can be seen from Horkenbach's preface; cf. ibid., p. 4. = Profiling in anti-Semitic public relations: The Cairo Process = Wilhelm van Meeteren, the head of the Siemens Cairo branch and president of the German Association in Cairo, had published an anti- Semitic brochure there in mid-1933 entitled \\"The Jewish Question in Germany\\". Thereupon, the Jewish businessman Umberto Jab√®s, with the support of the Ligue Internationale Contre l'Antis√©mitisme (LICA, i.e. the International League against Anti-Semitism), had sued van Meeteren for damages for insult. The trial was to take place before a so-called Mixed Court, an Egyptian body for the settlement of legal disputes involving foreigners. On August 30, 1933, a discussion of the upcoming trial took place at the Foreign Office in Berlin's Wilhelmstra√üe, to which representatives of the Ministry of Propaganda were also invited. The young lawyer Diewerge was commissioned by this ministry to \\"prepare the ground\\" for the legal dispute.Cf. Albrecht Fuess: Between Internment and Propaganda. The German Community in Egypt 1919-1939, in: Journal of the German Oriental Society, Supplement XI. XXVI German Orientalist Day, 25-29 September in Leipzig. Franz Steiner, Stuttgart, 1998, pp. 334-343, here: S. 341 Disturbed by the news that Jab√®s had won the internationally renowned Parisian lawyer Henri Torr√©s as his legal representative, the German Foreign Ministry initially pursued a cautious strategy and tried to keep the subject out of public debate in particular. Diewerge, on the other hand, sent a ten-page report to the Foreign Office on 29 September 1933 entitled \\"Press Support for the Cairo Trial\\", which, on the contrary, aimed to exploit the trial as publicly as possible. Diewerge drafted a detailed public relations strategy for this. He named media, target groups and costs and proposed a uniform label under which the trial would appear in the Nazi press: \\"Cairo Jewish Trial\\". According to him, the entire plan was coordinated in detail with the national group leader of the NSDAP in Egypt, Alfred Hess (Rudolf Hess' brother). The aim of the projected press work was clear from an enclosed sample text entitled \\"International Jewish Conspiracy against Germany in Egypt Revealed\\". Diewerge also immediately made public use of this sample text: for a lecture on October 5, 1933 on the radio and an article in the V√∂lkischer Beobachter, which was largely identical to the text and appeared on October 6.Kassim 2000, pp. 364-367 The article in the V√∂lkischer Beobachter was entitled: A New Edition of the London Jewish Theatre in Cairo, Again an Anti- German Hate Trial of International Jewry; cf. Kassim 2000, pp. 367. Furthermore, he sent the text via the lawyer of confidence of the German legation in Cairo to selected Arabic and French-language newspapers in Cairo in order to generate the desired press response in Egypt as well. Among other things, he arranged for the newspaper La Libert√©, which is close to the Egyptian King Fu'ad I., to publish an interview with Goebbels on the day of the trial.Fuess 1996, p. 104. Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1993-020-32A, Berlin, Wilhelmplatz, Propagandaministerium Diewerge succeeded in asserting himself with his ideas. At the beginning of 1934 he was appointed commissioner for the preparation and conduct of the trial. He travelled to Cairo as Special Rapporteur of the V√∂lkischer Beobachter. He wrote newspaper reports, gave an interview to the Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram and, after Jab√®s' complaint had been dismissed, on 31 January 1934 he gave a radio speech from Cairo on all German stations celebrating the \\"German victory over world Jewry\\". In 1935, after Jab√®s had also failed in the appeals court, Diewerge wrote a propagandistically designed report with the subtitle \\"Court-certified material on the Jewish question\\" in the party publishing house of the NSDAP. In this court case, a division of labour had been established for the first time, which was continued in further proceedings: The internationally renowned international law expert Friedrich Grimm took over the legal side of the proceedings and appeared in the main hearing, while Diewerge took care of the journalistic and political planning in the sense of the Ministry of Propaganda. In March 1934 Diewerge was employed as a government assessor in Goebbels' Reich Ministry of Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda.Fuhrer 2012, p. 81. In mid-1935, he was listed in various constellations for Cuno Horkenbach's yearbooks as \\"Referent\\" in Department VII of this ministry, which is titled \\"Defense\\" or \\"Defense against lies.Horkenbach 1935, who notes in the preface that the status of the information on the organizations is that of the middle of 1935; see also Cuno Horkenbach: Handbuch der Reichs- und Staatsbeh√∂rden, K√∂rperschaften und Organisationen, 1935/1936, Wirtschaftsverlag Berlin. For Diewerge this marked the beginning of a continuous rise. In 1936 he was promoted to the government council, in 1939 to the upper government council. In 1941 he reached the career level of a ministerial councilor. In 1936 he married, by 1941 the couple already had three children. An undated assessment of the ministry about Diewerge was very positive, in particular his attitude to the Nazi world view was acknowledged as \\"unconditional\\".Fuhrer 2012, p. 84. His duties included propaganda lectures abroad, among other things in connection with a three-month trip to Africa in 1937.Cf. Elke Fr√∂hlich (Ed.): Die Tageb√ºcher von Joseph Goebbels. K. G. Saur, Munich. Part I: Records 1923-1941. 1997-2005. volume 3, II, p. 382. Time and again his activities revolved around incidents, trials and publications abroad that gave rise to anti-Semitic campaigns against so-called world Jewry. = The Gustloff case: Anti-Semitic politicization of a murder trial = In 1936, Diewerge's responsibilities in Department VII of the Propaganda Ministry, now called \\"Foreign Countries\\", extended to France, the French possessions in North Africa (Algeria, Tunisia), Morocco, Egypt, Monaco, and Switzerland.Hans- Adolf Jacobsen: National Socialist foreign policy 1933-1938; Frankfurt/Berlin: Alfred Metzner, 1968, p. 714. When David Frankfurter shot the NS regional group leader Wilhelm Gustloff in Davos on February 4, 1936, Diewerge was given a new opportunity to demonstrate his abilities in anti-Semitic propaganda. As early as February 18, he asked the Foreign Office for material on the assassination and the situation of the Nazi regional group in Switzerland in order to produce a brochure on the subject. In April, he had completed this brochure, again in cooperation with the foreign organization of the NSDAP. It was published under the title Der Fall Gustloff: Vorgeschichte und Hintergr√ºnde der Bluttat von Davos by the NSDAP's in-house publishing house, Franz-Eher-Verlag. As in the Cairo affair, tensions arose between the Ministry of Propaganda and the Foreign Office, which in this case was supported by the Reich Ministry of Economics. However, this did not concern the content of the brochure, but only the official date of publication. With reference to important economic negotiations with Switzerland and the occupation of the Rhineland, the foreign and economic policy-makers demanded that the distribution of the booklet be waited until the summer. They were thus able to assert themselves. The aim of the pamphlet was to blame Swiss politics and the critical reporting of the Swiss press on the one hand, and a Jewish-Bolshevik conspiracy, whose agent was allegedly Frankfurter, on the other. Since a large part of the brochure consisted of - tendentiously selected - press quotes, which Diewerge then commented in each case from a Nazi perspective, Nazi propaganda could hope that the distribution of the work in Switzerland would not be banned. In fact, there was never a state ban. Only the Swiss Federal Railways prohibited distribution via station kiosks, which resulted in a - unsuccessful - official protest by the German legation councillor Carl Werner Dankwort. Diewerge's Machwerk was particularly aggressive against 125 Swiss parliamentarians who had spoken out in favor of awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to Carl von Ossietzky, who was imprisoned in a Nazi concentration camp:After Gillabert 2008, pp. 57-60, and Chotjewitz 1986, p. 128; on the protest of Dankwort see Stephan Schwarz: Ernst Freiherr von Weizs√§cker's Relations with Switzerland (1933-1945). Bern: Peter Lang, 2007, p. 236. > \\"And these shepherd boys take pleasure in attacking and insulting the > government of Germany because of a notorious criminal\\"Quoted after > Chotjewitz 1986, p. 159; in Diewerges brochure p. 25. When the trial of David Frankfurter took place in Chur in December 1936, Diewerge and Friedrich Grimm shared the work again. Diewerge directed and organized the press work, Grimm created a role for himself as a representative of Gustloff's widow in the accompanying civil suit, which enabled him to make at least a brief appearance in Chur. Together they searched for and found a Swiss lawyer (Werner Ursprung) for the criminal case against Frankfurter.Fuhrer 2012, p. 81 and 95 ff. Diewerge gave instructions to the German newspapers and wrote there himself, again as special reporter for the V√∂lkischer Beobachter, launched press releases in Switzerland and led the German press delegation in Chur.Gillabert 2008, pp. 92 and 97-99; Chotjewitz 1986, especially pp. 165 ff. Even before the trial, he came up with the idea of inviting selected Swiss journalists on an \\"information trip\\" to a German concentration camp and also offering them an interview with Roland Freisler (then State Secretary in the Reich Ministry of Justice). This plan worked: On 22 November 1936, four journalists set off for B√∂rgermoor concentration camp at the expense of the Ministry of Propaganda, accompanied by members of the Ministry's press department. The Freisler interview also came off. And indeed, on November 29, the Basler Nachrichten published an article about the camp that was entirely in keeping with German intentions, praising among other things the \\"surprisingly low percentage of sick people\\" and \\"pretty red farmhouses\\".Fuhrer 2012, p. 108 ff. In Chur, as in Cairo, the Diewerge/Grimm duo was on a \\"paradoxical mission\\":Gillabert 2008, p. 83. on the one hand, it was to prevent the trial from developing into a tribunal on German anti- Semitism; on the other hand, it was to use the trial as a starting point for anti-Semitic propaganda at home and abroad. Goebbels was, according to his diary, of the opinion that they had completed this undertaking \\"excellently\\" and \\"brilliantly\\".Diary entry of 22 January 1937, see Elke Fr√∂hlich (eds.): Die Tageb√ºcher von Joseph Goebbels. K. G. Saur, Munich. Part I: Records 1923-1941. 1997-2005. Volume 3, II, p. 338. In 1937 Diewerge published a second propaganda brochure about the trial under a title borrowed from Friedrich Sieburg: \\"A Jew shot ... In doing so, he was able to rely on the complete trial files that were available to him about Grimm and Ursprung, and among other things quote for pages from the letters that Frankfurter had received in prison.Chotjewitz 1986, p. 157. Here Diewerge emphatically advocated the thesis of the Jewish world conspiracy, whereby he particularly attacked the German emigrant and Swiss citizen Emil Ludwig, who had published a book on the deed of Frankfurter: Ludwig's book, which Diewerge consistently referred to as \\"Ludwig-Cohn\\" to emphasize his Judaism, was \\"one of the most valuable and best pieces of evidence for the correctness of the Nazi racial legislation and the necessity of the eradication of Judaism from German cultural life.\\"Quoted after Chotjewitz 1986, p. 160 f.; with Diewerge p. 26 f. Frankfurters' defense counsel and the psychiatric expert also appeared in Diewerge's book as agents of Judaism with the Star of David, although they had no Jewish background whatsoever. Diewerge's insulting attacks on Swiss citizens, journalists, lawyers and politicians were not forgotten in Switzerland; the Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung in particular repeatedly referred to the experiences of 1936 and 1937 in detailed reports on Diewerge's activities in the Federal Republic of Germany after the Second World War.Cf. above all: B. S.: A perjury trial in Essen. Condemnation of the former Reich speaker Diewerge. In: Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung of 20 February 1966. = The case of Herschel Grynszpan: propaganda and trial planning = On November 7, 1938, the day of Herschel Grynszpan's assassination of Ernst Eduard vom Rath, the Legation Secretary of the German Embassy in Paris, the German News Bureau issued instructions that this incident should be highlighted in all German newspapers \\"in the greatest form\\". Special emphasis was placed on the political evaluation: \\"In their own comments it should be pointed out that the assassination must have the most serious consequences for the Jews in Germany ...\\". Wolfgang Diewerge was given as the contact for information, and was available to journalists from now on in his office in the Reich Ministry of Propaganda; background literature was also recommended to the reporters: Diewerge's anti-Semitic brochures on the assassination attempt on Gustloff. On the very same day Diewerge must have written a model for such a commentary because the following day, November 8, the V√∂lkischer Beobachter appeared with an editorial he had drawn. Under the headline \\"Criminals at the Peace of Europe\\" Diewerge wrote > \\"It is clear that the German people will draw their conclusions from this > new crime. It is an impossible state of affairs that within our borders > hundreds of thousands of Jews still dominate entire shopping streets, > populate places of amusement and, as 'foreign' homeowners, pocket the money > of German tenants, while their racial comrades outside call for war against > Germany and shoot down German officials. The line from David Frankfurter to > Herschel Gr√ºnspan is clearly drawn. [...] We will remember the names of > those who confess to this cowardly murder [...] They are the same forces as > in Cairo and Davos, they are Jews and not French. The shots fired at the > German Embassy in Paris will not only mark the beginning of a new attitude > on the Jewish question, but will hopefully also be a signal to those > foreigners who have not yet realized that in the end only the international > Jew stands between the understanding of peoples\\". On November 8, Diewerge himself then appeared at the Reich press conference and gave more precise instructions on reporting, especially on her anti- Semitic tendencies (for example, Emil Ludwig was to be identified as one of the intellectual originators of the assassination; as already practiced in 1937, always with the epithet \\"Cohn\\") In retrospect, Diewerge's activities can be understood as a way of getting the population in the mood for the November pogroms, which took place during the so-called Reichskristallnacht from November 9 to 10, 1938. When the trial of Grynszpan was being prepared in France, Friedrich Grimm was again to take part in it as a lawyer for the German Reich, while Diewerge was to provide journalistic support. And Diewerge's propaganda writings again came down to the already familiar tenor: the accused had performed the act as an instrument of world Jewry, Diewerge said in his writing on \\"Gr√ºnspan and his accomplices\\", which appeared in 1939. Admittedly, there was no longer a trial, since the French public prosecutor's charge was not brought until 8 June 1940, a few days before the Germans invaded Paris. When Grynszpan was caught in unoccupied France, Grimm successfully demanded the Vichy regime's extradition and Grynszpan was brought to Berlin. There Joseph Goebbels intended to hold a large show trial, to which, among others, the former French Foreign Minister Georges Bonnet was to be invited as a witness. Diewerge was commissioned to plan this trial: \\"Ministerial Councillor Diewerge of the Ministry of Propaganda has the special task of handling the trial of the murderer Grynszpan from a propaganda point of view.\\"Heiber 1957, p. 147, citing an internal letter from the Foreign Office. In fact Diewerge pushed the plans far ahead, there was already a detailed time and appearance plan for the court trial to be staged, in which Diewerge himself also had a role to play, namely as a speaker \\"on the preparation of world Jewry for the war against the Reich, in particular through the deed of Gr√ºnspan\\"Heiber 1957, p. 159. But in May 1942 the project was stopped, apparently for two reasons: The Nazi leadership feared that Grynszpan would publicly present his act as an act in the hustler milieu, thus thwarting the propagandistic intention of the show trial; and the concept of suggesting credibility with the appearance of a French politician was rejected as politically inappropriate.Cf. Heiber 1957, p. 166 = Jewish plutocracy, Jewish Bolshevism: Anti-Semitic propaganda in millions = Diewerge continued to receive prestigious commissions in the Ministry of Propaganda, for example, he prepared the radio broadcast for Hitler's 50th birthday on 20 April 1939Fuhrer 2012, p. 87. In August 1939, one month before the invasion of Poland, he was appointed director of the Danzig radio station on the grounds that a \\"politician\\" was now needed at the head of the institution in this area of tension. Under his directorship, the station reported for the first time as \\"Reichssender Danzig\\", on the occasion of Hitler's speech on the attack on Poland on September 1.Ansgar Diller: Broadcasting Policy in the Third Reich. DTV, Munich 1980, p. 260 f. Diewerge's successor as director was Carl-Heinz Boese, while he himself took over as head of the Reich Propaganda Office Danzig in September 1939. There Diewerge organized the establishment of a network of Reich, Gau and district speakers for the NSDAP.Buchna 2010, p. 85. With a brief interruption due to a deployment at the front as war correspondent in the summer of 1940, Diewerge remained in Danzig until February 1941. Then Goebbels brought him back to Berlin and appointed him head of the radio department in the Ministry of Propaganda. With this Diewerge had reached the peak of his career: He was now responsible for the entire political department of radio, especially for news and propaganda broadcasts. The historian and Goebbels biographer Peter Longerich judges that Diewerge, as \\"one of the most distinguished propagandists in the ministry\\", was entrusted by Goebbels not only with the management of the broadcasting department, but also with \\"overall responsibility for the political-propagandistic broadcasts of the Gro√üdeutscher Rundfunk\\". In addition to this activity, Diewerge worked on the construction of a Jewish world danger with two high-volume publications for the Nazi regime: He wrote a 32-page pamphlet Das Kriegsziel der Weltplutokratie, which, according to Goebbels' diary, was distributed in no less than five million copies.Cf. Jeffrey Herf: The Jewish Enemy. Nazi Propaganda During World War II and the Holocaust. Harvard University Press, 2006, p. 112; see also: Elke Fr√∂hlich (eds.): Die Tageb√ºcher von Joseph Goebbels. K. G. Saur, Munich. Part II: Dictations 1941-1945. 1993-1996. Volume 1, p. 328. In it, he used quotes from a small edition of a brochure by the American Theodore Newman Kaufman, published by himself and otherwise hardly noticed, which, among other things, called for the sterilization of all Germans in the event of an American-German war. He dramatized this booklet on the demonic Kaufman plan, in which Judaism prescribed the destruction of Germanity for the Americans, and incorrectly gave the Jewish name Nathan as Kaufman's middle name. Diewerge's commentary contained this undisguised threat under the heading \\"Who shall die - the Germans or the Jews? > \\"How would it be if, instead of the 80 million Germans, these 20 million > Jews were treated according to the recipe of their race comrade Kaufman? > Then peace would be secured in any case. For the troublemaker, the disturber > of the peace, all over the world is the Jew\\".Diewerge: War Goal of the World > Plutocracy, p. 14, quoted here after Benz 1981, p. 623. Goebbels expressed his satisfaction and said that the pamphlet would \\"finally do away with the last rudiments of a possible pliability, for even the most stupid can see from this pamphlet what threatens us if we should ever become weak\\".Elke Fr√∂hlich (Ed.): The Diaries of Joseph Goebbels. K. G. Saur, Munich. Part II: Dictations 1941-1945. 1993-1996. Volume 1, p. 328. In the same year, Diewerge published an alleged collection of field mail letters from German soldiers under the title German Soldiers See the Soviet Union, which served to conjure up a Jewish-Bolshevik world danger on the basis of carefully selected and edited or even inventedSee Michaela Kipp: \\"Big Cleanup East.\\" Enemy Images in German Field Post Letters in the Second World War. Campus, Frankfurt/New York 2014, p. 73. Kipp concludes that although the individual statements in Diewerge's letter collection seemed \\"conceivable\\", the \\"density of National Socialist propaganda formulas\\" rather speaks for a falsification. At least Diewerge's edition of letters represents a \\"very specific selection\\". Cf. also with a similar tenor ibid., p. 43. Especially anti-Semitic slogans are found here in a far greater density than in the collection of private field mail that Kipp examined, cf. ibid., p. 247. eyewitness accounts. In the texts contained therein, pogroms and genocide against the Jews were greeted with enthusiastic words: > \\"What happened in Lviv was repeated in the smallest villages. Everywhere > [i.e. the 'Bolsheviks'] exterminated Ukrainians and Poles, but never a Jew. > This is characteristic of the true perpetrators. But the people's rage was > directed against this criminal people. They were beaten to death like dogs, > as they deserved it.\\"From an alleged eyewitness report of a captain to a > NSDAP district leader under the date July 14, 1941, printed in Diewerge, > German soldiers see the Soviet Union.

Berlin: Limpert, 1941, p. 43. This brochure, too, was distributed in millions of copies and was recommended to all journalists of the German Reich via instructions from the Reich Press Conference.Cf. Thilo Stenzel: The Russia image of the 'little man'. Mitteilungen des Osteuropa-Instituts M√ºnchen, No. 27, June 1998, here p. 20; cf. also Elke Fr√∂hlich (Ed.): Die Tageb√ºcher von Joseph Goebbels. K. G. Saur, Munich. Part II: Dictations 1941-1945. 1993-1996. Volume 2, p. 319. In his position as Head of the Broadcasting Department, Diewerge had permanent conflicts of competence with Heinrich Glasmeier, the Reichsintendant of the German Broadcasting Corporation. The mutual intrigues were repeatedly reflected in Goebbels' diary, who wished for greater assertiveness on the part of his head of department, but on the other hand did not want to comply with Diewerge's wish to drop Glasmeier.Cf. Elke Fr√∂hlich (Ed.): Die Tageb√ºcher von Joseph Goebbels. K. G. Saur, Munich. Part I, volume 9, p. 372 (14 June 1941); Part II, volume 3, p. 298 (13 February 1942), p. 406 (3 March 1942), p. 451 (5 June 1942). Ultimately, Diewerge was only able to hold on to this position until October 1942; at that time Hans Fritzsche replaced him as \\"Goebbels' man at the radio\\". This was apparently also related to the fact that in the course of the war, the entertainment component of the radio program grew significantly in comparison to the direct political propaganda.Cf. Callis 2005, especially p. 57 ff. A member of the SS since September 1936, Diewerge then volunteered for frontal service in the Waffen-SS divisions Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler and Wiking.Buchna 2010, p. 83. As a war correspondent, he wrote and spoke about 30 radio reports from the Caucasus under titles such as \\"Husarenstreich auf Volkswagen\\". After a stay in a military hospital in Krakow, Goebbels had him declared indispensable; his deployment on the front was thus over.Fuhrer 2012, p. 86 f. In the following years, the Ministry of Propaganda employed Diewerge for a number of tasks, including lecture tours in and reports from occupied and neutral foreign countries. Among other things, he traveled to Turkey with propaganda speeches and then reported to Goebbels on the mood there. In the last year of the war he was again commissioned to go to Danzig. In the course of his propaganda activities Diewerge received a number of other functions and awards: Since 1935 he was a Reich orator, later also a foreign orator for the NSDAP. On September 19, 1939, he received the NSDAP's Golden Party Badge on an honorary basis, wore the SS's honorary dagger and ring of honour and had held the rank of SS-Standartenf√ºhrer since 1943. He is often referred to in literature as the bearer of the Blood Order of the NSDAP, but this cannot be regarded as certain.Kristian Buchna could not find any confirmation of this in a recent study. See Buchna 2010, p. 83, footnote 302. Diewerge is said to have belonged to the inner circle of those who were present at Goebbels' farewell ceremony in Berlin's 'F√ºhrer Bunker' on April 30, 1945. On May 1, according to his own statement, he \\"managed to make his way west\\".  In the Federal Republic of Germany  After the war Diewerge would have fallen under the automatic arrest of the Allies because of his state and SS functions. He went into hiding and is said to have initially worked as an office manager for a lawyer in Hesse,Cf. Buchna 2010, p. 85, which quotes a memo for information by Franz Bl√ºcher: Bundesarchiv, N 1080/260, p. 87; cf. also the report by Fritz Neumayer, Thomas Dehler and Alfred Onnen for the Federal Executive Committee of the FDP, Chapter II, Section 2, Archive Link (Memento of 22 August 2004 on the Internet Archive) and Norbert Frei: Vergangenheitspolitik. The Beginnings of the Federal Republic and the Nazi Past. Munich: Beck, 1996, p. 366. until a new career opportunity with the FDP North Rhine-Westphalia arose through the mediation of his old colleague Friedrich Grimm. = The National Collection of the North Rhine-Westphalian FDP and the Naumann district = In 1951 Grimm introduced Diewerge to Ernst Achenbach, who during the Nazi era was head of the political department of the embassy in Paris and was now the foreign policy spokesman for the FDP. On Achenbach's recommendation, Diewerge obtained the position of personal secretary to Friedrich Middelhauve, the regional chairman of the North Rhine-Westphalian FDP. This personnel decision was not an isolated case, but a component of Middelhauve's attempt to establish a \\"National Collection\\" to the right of the CDU and SPD, which was to include Nazi officials in particularCf. Buchna 2010, in particular the chapters Die nordrhein- westf√§lische FDP auf dem Weg zur Nationalen Sammlung and Nationale Sammlung in der Praxis, pp. 35-126; see also J√∂rg Friedrich, Die kalte Amnestie. NS- perpetrators in the Federal Republic of Germany, Piper, Munich 1994, pp. 317-333. According to Middelhauve's later statements, it was made in full knowledge of Diewerge's activities during the Nazi era; the decisive factor was his \\"professional qualification\\".Buchna 2010, p. 82 and 85. Historian Kristian Buchna comments: \\"Not of all people, but especially the experienced former Goebbels employee seemed predestined to train 'systematically new and additional speakers' in courses lasting several days, who were to be used in future as multipliers for the national collection course\\".Buchna, 2010, p. 85; the quotation in the quote is taken from the minutes of the meeting of the managing state executive of the FDP of 23 April 1952. In his new position, Diewerge published, among other things, central training materials for election speakers (\\"Rednerschnellbrief\\"); from September to December 1952, at Middelhauve's suggestion, he was even entrusted with speaker training for the federal FDPBuchna 2010, p. 163 f. He also designed speech manuscripts for Middelhauve. Diewerge also wrote articles for the North Rhine-Westphalian FDP magazine Die Deutsche Zukunft and was instrumental in editorial work on a \\"German Program\\" that was to make the planned \\"national collection\\" binding for the federal FDP; according to Lutz Hachmeister, he was even the main author of this program.[60] Speaker seminars organized by Diewerge served, for example, to train officials of the FDP youth organization, the Young Democrats, in the contents of the German Program. To such seminars he invited Paul Hausser, among others; Middelhauve also offered him to use Diewerge's expertise for the \\"press-related preparation\\" of an event organized by Hausser's mutual aid association for members of the former Waffen-SS.Buchna 2010, p. 119, 132. At the same time Diewerge - at least partly with Middelhauve's knowledgeCf. Buchna 2010, p. 129 f. \\\\- acted as a liaison of the Naumann circle. This group of former Nazi functionaries led by Diewerge's former superior, the former state secretary in the Propaganda Ministry Werner Naumann, attempted to transform the FDP in the Nazi sense: \\"Whether a liberal party can ultimately be transformed into a Nazi combat group [...] I would like to doubt, but we must give it a try,\\" said a speech manuscript by Naumann from 18th January 2008.Quoted from Norbert Frei: Vergangenheitspolitik. Munich 1996, p. 361. The manuscript was later confiscated by the British High Commissioner's Office when Naumann was arrested. Norbert Frei quotes from copies from the archives of liberalism. Diewerge kept Naumann permanently informed by telephone conversations - tapped by the British secret service - and made numerous FDP materials available to him (including the \\"Rednerschnellbrief\\"). When the FDP provided him with a car for the speaker training, Diewerge told Naumann by telephone that he could now visit all the \\"Gauhauptst√§dte\\" (regional capitals) to refresh his contacts from the Nazi era. Diewerge also presented Naumann and Hans Fritzsche with the draft of the \\"German Programme\\" for review.Buchna 2010, S. 113-118 and 131; Christof Brauers: The FDP in Hamburg 1945 to 1953, Munich: Martin Meidenbauer Verlag, 2007, p. 581; see also: J√∂rg Friedrich, Die kalte Amnestie. NS-perpetrators in the Federal Republic of Germany, Piper, Munich 1994, S. 322. On 14-15 January 1953, several members of the Naumann Circle, then also known as the Gauleiter conspiracy, were arrested by the authority of the British High Commissioner in accordance with his Allied reservation rights. Thereupon, a commission of the Federal Executive Committee of the FDP under the leadership of Thomas Dehler began to investigate the personnel policy of the North Rhine-Westphalian FDP and the connections between the FDP and the Naumann district. In particular the Diewerge personnel policy was now increasingly discussed both within the party and in public, in the FDP Diewerge was chosen as a victim and demands for his dismissal became more frequent.J√∂rg Friedrich, Die kalte Amnestie. NS- T√§ter in der Bundesrepublik, Piper, M√ºnchen 1994, p. 322. The latter then offered Middelhauve to give up his position of his own accord, but Middelhauve at first tenaciously held on to his employee. Only when it turned out that Diewerge was in fact politically untenable in the FDP, Middelhauve finally accepted his application for dismissal on April 1, 1953.Buchna 2010, p. 163-166. Diewerge himself spoke of \\"mutual agreement\\" in a reader's letter to Der Spiegel.Cf. Diewerge's letter to the editor in Spiegel of 27 May 1953. The preliminary report of the FDP federal executive committee also called for Diewerge's party expulsion. Only when this was discussed in the executive committee on June 7, 1953, did it turn out that Diewerge was \\"certainly not\\" a member of the FDP, which a number of members of the executive committee noted with great astonishment. Thomas Dehler stated that this information had \\"taken his breath away\\" and connected this with bitter reproaches to the address of Middelhauve: \\"Do you really want to say, Dr. Middelhauve, that you do not bear any responsibility for the fact that such a man who was not a member of the party was presented to us by you as a trainer for the whole party? This is outrageous!\\"Udo Wengst (Ed.): Freie Demokratische Partei. Sitzungsprotokolle. Teil 1: Die Liberalen unter dem Vorsitz von Theodor Heuss und Franz Bl√ºcher: 1949‚Äì1954. 2nd half volume. Droste, D√ºsseldorf 1990, p. 1046 and 1048 f. Diewerge felt unjustly treated by the FDP and the public, as he wrote in several letters to Thomas Dehler. He demanded understanding for the fact \\"that 20 years ago a young assessor full of zest for action and ambition threw himself on his first big assignment\\" and complained that due to the scandalization in the public his behavior in the FDP now appeared \\"negative\\", although it would have been \\"considered as harmless, if not appropriate in case of normal development\\".Both quotations are taken from a letter from Diewerge to Dehler dated 14 February 1953; reproduced here after Buchna 2010, p. 165. Still in 1956 he demanded a rehabilitation from Dehler, because he had had professional disadvantages due to the affair. He had been forced to \\"familiarize himself with a completely foreign industry without any possibility to use my education and my previous knowledge\\".Letter from Diewerge to Dehler of December 15, 1956, quoted in Ralph Schleimer (1998): Demokratiegr√ºndung und Parteipolitik.

In: Geschichte im Westen, 13th volume, S. 7-39, here: S. 35. reproduced here after Buchna 2010, S. 200 Apparently the advertising industry was meant, because in the following years Diewerge worked as advertising manager in Essen.Cf. Der Tote lebt, in: Der Spiegel of 31 August 1960; see also the information on the person in the Soltikow trial 1955, online. = Caught up in the past: The Essen perjury trial = In 1966 his Nazi past caught up with him once again: The Regional Court in Essen instituted a perjury trial against Diewerge. The reason for this was Diewerge's testimony in 1959 in a trial against the author Michael Graf Soltikow, who had claimed in various publications that the assassination attempt by Herschel Grynszpan was demonstrably due to homosexual relations between Grynszpan and vom Rath - a brother of vom Raths had sued Soltikow for this. The charges against Diewerge were essentially based on two points: Firstly, Diewerge had declared under oath in the Soltikow trial that he had only heard about an alleged homosexual motive for the crime at a late stage and that he was not aware that such a statement had contributed to the termination of the Grynszpan trial. Secondly, he had \\"categorically\\" denied that he had known anything about propagandistic \\"secondary intentions\\" in 1941 and 1942, especially that the trial was intended to justify \\"anti-Jewish measures\\".Cf. Wolfgang Kuballa: Herschel Gr√ºnspan's motive remains unexplained. The murder of the Rath diplomat will be reopened in the trial against the Nazi official Diewerge. In: S√ºddeutsche Zeitung of January 26, 1966; Gerhard Mauz: Whatever one might say about Dr. Goebbels ... Spiegel reporter Gerhard Mauz on the trial against Wolfgang Diewerge. In: Der Spiegel, January 17, 1966; B. S.: A perjury trial in Essen. Condemnation of the former Reich Speaker Diewerge. In: Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung, February 20, 1966. The literal quotations are taken from the most detailed description, the NZZ article. See also the copy of Diewerge's testimony in the Diewerge witness journal of the IfZ, online. Kristian Buchna summarizes in retrospect Diewerge had presented himself in the 1959 interrogation as an \\"ignorant, by no means anti-Semitic recipient of orders\\".Buchna 2010, p. 199. Landgericht Essen In the Essen trial Diewerge stuck to his claims and stated that he had first heard about the Final Solution from an English newspaper in Stockholm in 1944. After a series of testimonies from high-ranking Nazi officials, including Ernst Lautz, Leopold Gutterer, Heinrich Hunke, Walter Jagusch, Ewald Kr√ºmmer and Franz Schlegelberger, the court came to the conclusion that Diewerge's testimony was not false with regard to the alleged homosexual motive for the crime. On the other hand, Diewerge had deliberately told the untruth with his assurance that he had no idea that the show trial against Grynszpan was intended to justify measures against Jews. In a judgment of 17 February 1966, Diewerge was sentenced to one year's imprisonment for perjury, which was later suspended on probation.B. S.: A perjury trial in Essen. Condemnation of the former Reich speaker Diewerge. In: Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung of 20 February 1966. In the same year, the Wiesbaden public prosecutor's office received another criminal complaint against Diewerge. It also referred to the show trial against Grynszpan prepared by Diewerge. Although the investigations were quickly discontinued, Hesse's Attorney General Fritz Bauer ordered his office to take over the proceedings. However, processing was slow; it was not until 1969 that the General Prosecutor's Office finally took over the investigations. It sought a conviction for accessory to murder: Diewerge had encouraged the mass murder of the Jews by planning and propagandistically using the show trial. Since the Grynszpan trial did not take place and therefore remained an unsuccessful attempt at aiding and abetting, the authorities discontinued the proceedings on 20 November 1969.gl. Matthias Meusch: From dictatorship to democracy. Fritz Bauer und die Aufarbeitung der NS-Verbrechen in Hessen (1956-1968), Wiesbaden, 2001, pp. 208-209. = Involvement in the Flick affair = Diewerge's connections to the FDP were not broken off during this time. This became apparent when he took over the management of two newly founded associations in 1968: the Gesellschaft f√ºr Europ√§ische Wirtschaftspolitik e.V. (GfEW), according to its statutes a tax- exempt professional association, and the International Business Club e.V. (IWC), which was recognised as a non-profit organisation and therefore also tax-exempt. Otto Graf Lambsdorff was vice-chairman of the GfEW, another high- ranking FDP politician, Wolfram Dorn, was vice-chairman of the IWC. As the Regional Court of Bonn stated in 1987, years after Diewerge's death, in the judgement against Eberhard von Brauchitsch, Hans Friderichs and Lambsdorff in the so-called Flick affair, these associations only pursued their statutory goals in appearance: In reality they served to receive tax-exempt industrial donations and to channel them indirectly to the FDP, i.e. they aided and abetted tax evasion. Diewerge retained the management of both associations for five years and, according to the findings of the Regional Court, was actively involved in disguising their true purposes. For example, on 27 January 1971 he wrote to the Neuwied tax office, which was planning an audit, \\"contrary to the truth\\",Leyendecker 1988, p. 120, who here quotes the judgment verbatim that the GfEW had started its activities as a professional association as planned, and drew up a list of corresponding activities. In 1973, at the age of 67, he resigned as managing director of both associations and was replaced by Joachim Friedrich von Stojentin, later by Friedrich Karl Patterson. He died in 1977, four years before the public prosecutor's investigations into the Flick affair began. Still in the week before his death, on 26/27 November 1977, he had been scheduled as an external speaker for an event of the HIAG to train the members of this traditional organization of the Waffen-SS in \\"public relations\\", but had had to cancel at short notice.Karsten Wilke: The \\"Mutual Assistance Association\\" (HIAG) 1950-1990: veterans of the Waffen-SS in the Federal Republic of Germany. Sch√∂ningh, Paderborn et al. 2011, (also: Bielefeld, Univ., Diss., 2010), p. 118.  Afterlife  Some of Diewerge's propaganda writings were digitalised in the Internet age and can be found on various radical right-wing or revisionist websites. In particular, the contents of the brochures on the \\"Gustloff case\\" and the \\"Kaufman plan\\" are still frequently used as propaganda material in the neo-Nazi scene. This situation is the starting point for G√ºnter Grass's novella Im Krebsgang (In the Crabwalk), published in 2002. On the right-hand website \\"www.blutzeuge.de\\", the first- person narrator finds himself in a chat room dealing with Wilhelm Gustloff and the fate of the ship of the same name. There he meets a chatterer who repeatedly cites the \\"party comrade and Reich orator Wolfgang Diewerge\\" as a source. Other chatters briefly touch upon Diewerge's connection with the Naumann circle and the Flick affair.G√ºnter Grass: Im Krebsgang, Munich: dtv, 2004 (paperback edition), especially pp. 14-15, but also in various other places. See also Paul A. Youngman: The realization of a virtual past in Gunter Grass's Crabwalk. In: Studies in Twentieth and Twenty-First Century Literature, Vol. 32 (2008), No. 1, pp. 179-201, online.  Research and literature situation  There is no comprehensive biography of Diewerge. In addition to the short, not detailed outlines in Ernst Klee's Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich and Wolfgang Benz' Handbuch des Antisemitismus, a relatively extensive account of Diewerge's biography can be found in Kristian Buchna's 2010 study. In contrast, there are already detailed research reports on the political activities in which Diewerge was involved, some of which at least marginally address Diewerge's actions. The Cairo Trial is dealt with from different perspectives in the studies by Gudrun Kr√§mer, Albrecht Fue√ü and Mahmoud Kassim, whereby the latter two in particular offer material on Diewerge's propaganda activities and also deal with his cooperation with the Nazi foreign organization and the differences to the line of the German Foreign Office. The Gustloff affair is dealt with in Peter O. Chotjewitz's extensive essay Murder as Catharsis and a study by Mathieu Gillabert. Here, too, the relationship between the Ministry of Propaganda, the foreign organization of the NSDAP and the Foreign Office plays a significant role. In 2012, Armin Fuhrer has presented a book which, based on archive research, especially in Swiss newspaper archives, provides new information about Diewerge's activities in the Gustloff case. Helmut Heiber's study of 1957 is still essential for Diewerge's role in the planned Grynszpan trial, while Alan E. Steinweis's book on Kristallnacht 1938 provides additional information. In 1981 Wolfgang Benz analysed Diewerge's booklet on the Kaufman Plan in the Quarterly Magazines for Contemporary History. In his book of 2010 Kristian Buchna has evaluated numerous archive sources on the \\"National Collection\\" of the FDP North Rhine-Westphalia and can therefore present Diewerges' activities in this context in great detail. The book by journalist Hans Leyendecker remains an important source for Diewerge's role in the Flick affair. Contemporary reports such as Cuno Horkenbach's handbook The German Reich from 1918 to the present day from 1935 or the press reports, especially those of the Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung on the Essen perjury trial, provide material for the phases of life that are not or hardly touched by these scientific publications. The Institute for Contemporary History has a collection of files on Diewerge. A collection containing notes of a conversation between Helmut Heiber and Diewerge and his testimony in the Soltikow trial is accessible online. A further collection containing the estate of the Essen public prosecutor Hans-Ulrich Behm, the prosecuting attorney in the Essen trial, has not yet been evaluated.Cf. the Hans-Ulrich Behm collection in the IfZ archive, finding aids online (PDF; 127 kB)  Fonts (selection)  * Als Sonderberichterstatter zum Kairoer Judenproze√ü.

Biography  Biel was born in Annaberg, Saxony in Germany. After a short stay in Lisbon he settled in Porto in 1860, at the age of 22, where he dedicated himself to commerce, industry, photography and publishing, being considered one of the introducers in Portugal of phototyping, a photo-mechanical printing process that allows many proofs to be printed from the same matrix and with the appearance of real photographs. He had the representation in Portugal of firms such as Coats & Clark, Benz, Schuckert & Co. (a Nuremberg electrical machinery company), among others. Between 1862 and 1864 he had a button factory in Rua da Alegria. In 1874, he bought the Fritz House (later known as Casa Biel) in Calle de Almada, a commercial house dedicated to photography, thus beginning his career in the world of photography. Later, to \\"Y. Biel & Cia\\" moved to the Count of Bolh√£o Palace, at 342 Rua Hermosa. As an editor, he published in 1880, on the third centenary of Cam√µes' death, a luxurious edition of Los lusiadas printed in Leipzig, Germany, which is now considered a masterpiece. He published important works richly illustrated with photographs, such as Manuel Monteiro's Douro: Principales Quintas, Navega√ß√£o, Culturas, Paisamentos e Cua√ß√µes (Porto: Emilio Biel & C¬™, 1911). He had a long collaboration with the historian and art critic Joaquim de Vasconcelos, with whom he edited, in Porto, and in partnership with the photographers Jos√© Augusto da Cunha Moraes and Fernando Br√ºtt, a work of eight volumes, published in instalments, entitled Art and Nature in Portugal (Porto, Em√≠lio Biel & C¬™ Editores, 1902-1908), which had the collaboration of a large group of writers and scholars. Among them were Joaquim Vasconcelos, Carolina Micha√´lis de Vasconcelos, Manuel Monteiro, Augusto Fuschini, Visconde de Vilarinho de S√£o Rom√£o (3rd), J√∫lio de Castilho, Ramalho Ortig√£o, Lu√≠s de Magalh√£es, Brito Rebelo, Gabriel Pereira, Lu√≠s Figueiredo da Guerra. Emilio also worked on landscape photography and large engineering works. In 1885, he began to document and photograph the construction of the railway in Portugal as well as the Port of Leix√µes in Matosinhos between 1884 and 1892. In the time of King D. Fernando de Saxe-Coburg-Gota, also of German nationality, he was a photographer of the Royal House. He was a photographic collaborator in the magazine Illustra√ß√£o Portugueza (1884-1890), in the weekly magazine Branco e Negro (1896-1898) and in the magazine Tiro e Sport(1904-1913). He installed the electric light in Vila Real, he was the administrator of the Empresa das √Åguas do Ger√™s, he drove the first tram that ran from Battle Square in the Port to Devesas (inaugurated on 28th October 1905), he introduced the first electric light installation in the Port and the first telephone. Following this interest in technological innovation, Biel devoted himself to horticulture and flower growing, as well as butterfly collecting. His collection is now housed in the Zoology Museum of the University of Porto and is considered one of the largest in the world. With Portugal's entry into World War I in 1916, the German colony was forced to leave the country in five days and its assets were confiscated. The Y. Biel & C.¬™ was also confiscated and its goods subsequently sold at public auction. As Em√≠lio Biel died on September 14, 1915, he was spared this disaster, which would however lead to the irretrievable loss of a large part of his photographic work (thousands of glass plates, phototypes and paper documents) and the dispersal of the remainder by various collectors and archives. Part of the plundered material of the Em√≠lio Biel & C¬™ company is in the possession of the Porto Municipal Historical Archive.

Life  Born in Vienna, Knepler, son of the composer and librettist and nephew of the music publisher and impresario , studied piano with Eduard Steuermann from 1926, conducting with Hans G√°l and musicology with Guido Adler, Wilhelm Fischer, Egon Wellesz, and Robert Lach at the University of Vienna. In 1931 he received his doctorate with the dissertation Die Form in den Instrumentalwerken Johannes Brahms as Dr. phil.. At the same time he accompanied Karl Kraus at the piano from 1928 to 1931, who performed Jacques Offenbach's operettas in Vienna, Berlin, Prague, Munich and other cities. In the same period he worked as Kapellmeister, Korrepetitor and conductor at the Wiener Volksoper and at the , from 1930 to 1931 in Mannheim and with Karl Rankl in Wiesbaden as well as leader of workers' choirs. The years 1932/33 are marked by the collaboration with Bertolt Brecht and Hanns Eisler. He was the piano accompanist of Helene Weigel, who sang Eisler's Wiegenlieder einer proletarischen Mutte (Lullabies of a Proletarian Mother) at workers' meetings. From 1933 onwards, the Jew and communist Knepler was forbidden any activity and he returned to Austria. Since he had joined the banned Communist Party of Austria in Vienna in April 1933 and distributed Communist newspapers, he was arrested in January 1934, but was able to emigrate to England the same year. There he turned more and more intensively to the teachings of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, adopted their world view and dialectics and developed his own research work on this basis. Parallel to his musicological and journalistic work, he was active as an opera conductor as well as musical director of the emigrant theatre \\"Laterndl\\" and secretary of the \\"Austrian Centre\\". In 1946 he went back to Vienna and took over the function of cultural adviser of the KP√ñ. From 1949 Knepler worked in East-Berlin, where the GDR was founded in the same year. He retained his Austrian citizenship. In 1957 he was transferred from the KP√ñ to the SED. = Teaching activity in Berlin = In 1950 Knepler founded the German Academy of Music Berlin, of which he became Rector, and which he directed until 1959. In 1964 it was given the name Hochschule f√ºr Musik \\"Hanns Eisler\\" in Berlin. His concept was aimed at the education of musicians and singers of \\"new type\\", who, in addition to their professional qualifications, should also actively participate in social life. From 1959 to 1970, he headed the Musicological Institute of the Humboldt University of Berlin, where he concentrated on the development of Marxist-oriented teaching and research in response to bourgeois musicology. In 1964 Knepler became a full member of the German Academy of Sciences at Berlin. Knepler died on 14 January 2003 in the hospital of K√∂penick at age 96, leaving behind his wife Florence Knepler (1910-2011), n√©e Wiles.

The visits served as cover to exchange letters between the countries' foreign offices making key defensive agreements. The French Navy visited Kronstadt on the Gulf of Finland on 23 July 1891 and the Russian Navy visited Toulon on 13 October 1893. Both visits were received by crowds of people, speeches from dignitaries and the singing of anthems. During the Toulon visit the Russians attempted to secure naval bases on the French Mediterranean coast but were unsuccessful. The Franco-Russian Alliance later, with the addition of Britain, developed into the Triple Entente that opposed Austria and Germany during the First World War.  Background  Germany entered into the Triple Alliance with Austria and Italy in 1882, forming a powerful bloc of Central European military power. In 1890 Germany allowed the Reinsurance Treaty with Russia to lapse. This treaty guaranteed the neutrality of either power in certain instances of war in Europe. The loss of the treaty left Russia concerned about an invasion from Austria at a time when France, diplomatically isolated in Europe since the loss of the 1870-71 Franco- Prussian War, was worried about another war with Germany. The Germans had presumed that Tsarist Russia was too ideologically different from Republican France for any formal alliance to be agreed. However the two countries' shared concerns over the Triple Alliance led to increasingly friendly relations. Russia at this time was reliant on French investment since Bismarck had banned German nationals from lending to Russia in 1887. Russia was less in favour of a formal defence agreement than the French were but wanted to guarantee a few years of peace to allow it to prepare for war; both parties therefore planned to enter into a series of secret agreements. Writing in 1893 Russian foreign minister Nikolay Girs said that the actions of \\"Bismarck drove us into the arms of France\\".  Kronstadt  Emperor Alexander III raises his hat during the singing of the Marseillaise A French Navy squadron visited the Russian port of Kronstadt on the Gulf of Finland on 23 July 1891. The squadron remained in the port for ten days during which it was granted an enthusiastic reception by the Russian populace. The French national anthem, La Marseillaise - previously banned in Russia as an anthem of republicanism, was sung by the Dmitri Slaviansky D'Agreneff choir. The Russian Emperor Alexander III, though known to be unenthusiastic about closer relationships with France, agreed to stand to attention during the singing of the anthem. Many notable people travelled to visit the port from the national capital, Saint Petersburg, just away and crowds on the quayside cheered \\"Vive la France\\". On 2 August the French officers were hosted at a meal in the capital. Some 600 guests attended and entertainment included the singing of both countries' national anthems and the performance of the second act of the French-language opera La fille du r√©giment. During the visit an agreement was reached, via an exchange of letters from the countries' foreign ministers, that if war was threatened in Europe then the two nations would agree on a joint response. There was also an agreement that if any of the Triple Alliance powers mobilised then France and Russia would both respond in kind. The agreement was kept secret but the naval visit served as a public indication of closer ties between the two nations and was viewed as an indication that a formal alliance was all but guaranteed to follow. The 1891 agreement was followed by more detailed arrangements including an 1892 mutual defence pact that the countries would come to one another's defence if either was attacked by Germany. In the wake of the agreement France made large loans to Russia and increased investment in its industrial development campaign. The British prime minister, Lord Salisbury, responded to the Kronstadt visit by inviting the French squadron to call at Portsmouth on its return journey to demonstrate that \\"England has no antipathy to France\\".  Toulon  battleship Imperator Nikolai I as depicted in Le Petit Journal, 7 October 1893 On 13 October 1893 the Russian Navy repaid the Kronstadt visit with a visit by a squadron under Rear Admiral Theodor Avellan to the French naval base at Toulon. The Russian battleship Imperator Nikolai I from the Baltic was joined by the cruiser Pamiat Azova from Cadiz and the cruisers Admiral Nakhimov and Rynda travelling from the United States. The gunboat Terets later joined the squadron in port, from the Mediterranean. The strength of the squadron sent was an indication of the political importance of the visit, which served to seal the mutual defence pact signed by the countries. In France the visit was viewed as more serious than that at Kronstadt and was perceived to formally end the period of French diplomatic isolation. The response of the French public was enthusiastic, by some estimates 300,000 people travelled to the town to welcome the squadron with some 165,000 railway tickets sold. This overwhelmed the town, which had only 70,000 residents, and led to food and water shortages. Many thousands were forced to sleep in the open, on boats or in carriages. The town's sewerage provision was inadequate and a writer in the British medical journal The Lancet raised concerns about a possible epidemic. The huge crowds lined the harbour, part of which was renamed \\"Kronstadt Quay\\", and sang the Russian national anthem. Numerous speeches were given by admirals, ministers and diplomats, commemorative plates were produced, celebratory songs performed and poems read by schoolchildren. Avellan was presented with jewellery including 2,300 bracelets embossed with \\"Cronstadt et Toulon\\" and the dates of the two visits, as presents for officers' wives and daughters. Avellan's officers afterwards toured France and visited Paris. Russia was keen to increase its influence in the Mediterranean and during the visit entered discussions with the French government over the leasing of naval bases on the Mediterranean coast. Despite some enthusiasm, there was even a suggestion that the countries could maintain a joint Mediterranean Fleet, no agreement was reached. After the Toulon visit Avellan took his squadron to the Eastern Mediterranean in an attempt to pressure Greece and Turkey into granting Russia a naval base on their territory. Avellan's ships lay off Piraeus for three months, keen to secure a coaling station on the isles of Poros where the Russian government owned land. British diplomatic pressure prevented this from happening and afterwards the Russian Navy, distracted by the 1894 outbreak of the First Sino-Japanese War, shifted its focus to the Pacific and Arctic. Britain responded to the Toulon visit by dispatching a squadron to visit the Italian naval base at La Spezia, keen to maintain Italian friendship against a possible Franco-Russian threat in the Mediterranean. Leo Tolstoy was critical of the naval visits in his 1894 essay Christianity and Patriotism. He considered the demonstrations of patriotism and friendship as contrived and regarded the sentiments shown during speeches as absurd.  Impact  French President √âmile Loubet and Russian Emperor Nicholas II review sailors at Kronstadt in 1902 In the year following the Toulon visit France and Russia negotiated the terms of the Franco-Russian Alliance. The alliance marked a significant shift in the balance of power in Europe with the Franco-Russian bloc standing as a counter to the dominance of the Triple Alliance. The French, keen to keep the alliance secret, chose not to discuss the matter in parliament and it was instead concluded by an exchange of letters in 1894. The Italians learned of the alliance and it caused them to reconsider their obligations to the Triple Alliance. This worried Austria who feared fighting on two fronts: against Russia and Italy. These fears were not unfounded, as after the 1915 Treaty of London the Italians declared war on Austria in the hope of gaining territory in the Alps and on the Adriatic Coast. The Franco- Russian alliance was renewed and strengthened in 1899 and 1912. The alliance was supplemented by the Anglo-French Entente Cordiale of 1904 and the Anglo- Russian Convention of 1907 and developed into the Triple Entente which opposed Germany and Austria during the First World War.

Its origins are medieval, but it was largely rebuilt in the very early 18th century by Elizabeth Wilbraham of Weston Park, and restored in the 19th century, firstly by George Edmund Street and then by Ewan Christian. It remains a functioning parish church in the Diocese of Lichfield. History Historic England records the foundation of the church as medieval. Pevsner describes the church as \\"an enterprise of Lady Wilbraham...[of] 1700‚Äì1\\". This was Elizabeth Mytton, heiress of the Weston estate, who married Sir Thomas Wilbraham in 1651. A 2010 article in the Architects' Journal by the historian John Millar, describes Elizabeth Wilbraham as \\"the first woman architect\\", and suggests that she may have undertaken designs for over 350 buildings, as well as tutoring and collaborating with Christopher Wren. Prevented by the conventions of the time for identifying as an architect, and from taking any public role in construction, Millar suggests that buildings attributed to architects such as Hugh May, Roger Pratt and William Winde, were in fact designed by Wilbraham, with the named architects acting as surveyors to carry out her plans. Millar's views are not universally accepted, and his planned book on Wilbraham has yet to be published. It is generally accepted that Wilbraham undertook designs for a number of buildings for family and friends, including her own home, Weston Park, and the estate Church of St Andrew. St Andrew's continues as a functioning church in the Diocese of Lichfield. Architecture and description Pevsner records that \\"only the east wall with a 14th century window\\" remained of the medieval church when Elizabeth Wilbraham begun her reconstruction in 1700. The tower and nave are her work. The tower is of five stages, with a castellated final stage. Historic England describes the nave as \\"provincial Baroque\\". George Edmund Street undertook a restoration in around 1869, and the font is his. Further work, including the construction of a family chapel, was done by Ewan Christian in 1876‚Äì1877. The chapel, and the church, contain monuments to the Earls of Bradford and their families, who owned Weston Park until 1986.

According to the decision, the proposed national security law seeks to prevent external interference in Hong Kong's affairs, criminalise acts that threaten national security such as subversion and secession, allow the Central People's Government (State Council) of China to establish a national security agency in Hong Kong when necessary and require the Chief Executive to send the central government periodic reports on national security. The pan-democratic camp, legal professionals, human rights organisations and politicians abroad have criticised the decision as a threat to the \\"one country, two systems\\" principle, the rule of law and civil liberties. An editorial in state-run China Daily opined that the \\"urgent need for such legislation\\" had become clear in view of the \\"overreactions of those rioters and their foreign backers\\". In late May 2020, Chinese diplomat Xie Feng said that the laws would only target a minority of \\"troublemakers\\" who had endangered Chinese national security. Around the same time, Hong Kong Secretary for Security John Lee said regarding the Hong Kong situation that ‚Äúterrorism is growing‚Äù and calls for Hong Kong independence had become more frequent, which necessitated the bill. Several Hong Kong government officials strove to reassure investors, with Financial Secretary Paul Chan writing on his blog that any harm to investor confidence was due to \\"misunderstanding\\" of the law.  Background and legal authority  The Hong Kong government in 2003 attempted to enact the National Security (Legislative Provisions) Bill 2003 to comply with the requirement under Article 23 of the Basic Law that it should enact national security legislation \\"on its own\\". However, the bill was abandoned after mass demonstrations. An extradition law amendment bill proposing to allow extradition to China was proposed in 2019, sparking the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests, later to be withdrawn. The South China Morning Post reported that the central government of the People's Republic of China was of the view that the political climate in Hong Kong would preclude the passage of a bill under Article 23, and so resorted to enactment through the National People's Congress instead. Unlike the National Security (Legislative Provisions) Bill 2003, an ordinary piece of legislation submitted to the Legislative Council (LegCo) to comply with the constitutional requirements of Article 23 of the Basic Law to enact laws in that connection, the law whose enactment is authorised by the decision would be enacted by inclusion in Annex III, which does not require a vote in the LegCo. The constitutionality of the inclusion of such laws in Annex III, whilst defended in a press release by the Department of Justice and by some members of the legal community, has been disputed by the Hong Kong Bar Association (HKBA). The dispute concerns what authority Article 18(3) of the Basic Law provides to the Standing Committee (NPCSC) of the National People's Congress. Article 18(3) provides for such enactments in cases concerning defence and foreign affairs, as well as other matters outside the limits of the autonomy of the Region. The Department of Justice's press release, however, stated that \\"national security is outside the limits of the autonomy of the HKSAR\\". The HKBA responded that in view of Article 23 of the Basic Law, which requires Hong Kong inter alia to enact laws on its own to prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedition, national security is \\"within\\" the limits of Hong Kong's autonomy. The Department of Justice maintained nevertheless that Article 23 authorises national security legislation but \\"does not preclude\\" additional legislation by the Central Authorities. Decision details  The decision, that may be translated from Chinese language as \\"Decision of the National People's Congress on Establishing and Perfecting the Legal System and Enforcement Mechanism of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to Maintain National Security\\" (ÂÖ®ÂõΩ‰∫∫Ê∞ë‰ª£Ë°®Â§ß‰ºöÂÖ≥‰∫éÂª∫Á´ãÂÅ•ÂÖ®È¶ôÊ∏ØÁâπÂà´Ë°åÊîøÂå∫Áª¥Êä§ÂõΩÂÆ∂ÂÆâÂÖ®ÁöÑÊ≥ïÂæãÂà∂Â∫¶ÂíåÊâßË°åÊú∫Âà∂ÁöÑÂÜ≥ÂÆö), comprises 7 articles, the Chinese text was published by state papers on 28 May 2020. Article 1 restates the importance of one country, two systems and the rule of law, and states that the \\"state\\" will \\"complete\\" legal and enforcement mechanisms to preserve national security. Article 2 says that the state will stop and punish \\"overseas forces' use of Hong Kong\\" for separatist, subversive or destructive activities. Article 3 states that maintaining China's sovereignty is Hong Kong's constitutional responsibility. It further requires Hong Kong to enact national security legislation \\"as soon as possible\\", and its executive, legislature and judiciary to \\"stop and punish conduct endangering national security\\". Article 4 requires Hong Kong to establish institutions to protect national security, and provides for a central government presence in Hong Kong to maintain national security. Article 5 requires regular reports from the Chief Executive of Hong Kong on national security. Article 6 authorises the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to draft a national security law, and then to include it in Annex III of the Basic Law. Article 7 provides that the decision as a whole shall take effect on promulgation. ChronologyDecision= The decision to impose the new law was approved on 28 May 2020 by a vote of 2878 to 1, with 6 abstentions. The NPCSC was therefore authorised to draft the official text of a national security law, and to enact it by including it in the Annex III of the Hong Kong Basic Law; Beijing has said the process will be completed by an \\"early date\\". A draft law was submitted to the NPCSC and reviewed on its 19th session from 18 June 2020 to 20 June 2020, details of which were released by state-run Xinhua news agency on 20 June. =Published draft details of the preparing law= On 20 June 2020, after a three-day meeting of the Standing Committee ‚Äì which had been tasked with preparing the new legislation ‚Äì, Xinhua newspaper published draft details that the Standing Committee had elaborated: presumed settling China's security office in Hong Kong to monitor security, as well as rules about monitoring education regarding national security aspects, prime importance of China's government decisions above Hong Kong government: \\"If the local laws... are inconsistent with this Law, the provisions of this Law shall apply. The power to interpret this law belongs to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.\\" =Enactment= On 30 June 2020, the NPCSC unanimously passed the Hong Kong national security law, which was subsequently gazetted on the same day and officially came into force. =Official text of the security law published = The details of the new legislation were kept in secret, even Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam did not see it, until the new law was published only in Chinese language at 11 o'clock in the evening Beijing time on 30 June 2020. The new law in the Chinese language took effect immediately after publishing, the China's State paper Xinhua also supplied text, translated in English \\"for reference only\\" under title \\"The Law of the People‚Äôs Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\\". The main articles of the new law can be paraphrased as follows: * Chinese government has to set up security office in Hong Kong with its own personnel; * The Hong Kong Chief Executive can establish judges; * Foreign news media and organisations are to be closely monitored; * The Chinese government has the right to conduct trials behind closed doors in serious cases; * Article 29 must be in effect to prevent inciting hatred against the Chinese or local government; * Secession, subversion, terrorism and colluding with foreign countries is to be punished with imprisonment from 3 years to life; * Serious interruption or sabotage of electronic control systems for providing and managing public services such as water, electric power, gas, transport, may be considered as terrorism. Added details about Article 43 emerged after the meeting of the Committee for Safeguarding National Security of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), headed by Carrie Lam, and were published on 6 July 2020; the added details state that: * Police can search a suspect's home without a warrant in case of urgency; * Police can ban a suspect from leaving Hong Kong; * Government can freeze assets of a suspect; * Government can monitor the web and ask internet providers to remove information. The same day, 6 July 2020, Facebook and WhatsApp said they suspended requests from Hong Kong Government about user data.  Domestic responses  Protests = Hundreds took to the street to demonstrate against the proposed national security law on 24 May 2020. Protesters marched in Mong Kok to protest against the proposed national security law and the national anthem bill on 27 May 2020. On 24 May 2020 a rally occurred to protest against the proposed security law. It was the biggest protest in Hong Kong since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. For the first time in two months, the police deployed tear gas in an attempt to disperse the protesters. On 27 May 2020, protesters gathered again on the streets to protest against the proposed national security law and the national anthem bill, which underwent its second reading on that day. Demonstrations of varying scale occurred in different districts including Causeway Bay, Central, and Mong Kok. Tear gas and pepper balls were fired and 360 people were arrested that day for unauthorised assembly and other charges. Analysis of the change in Hong Kong protests The Guardian's China specialists Tania Branigan and Lily Kuo wrote that the protest movement in Hong Kong changed after the NPC announcement of the law, with the mood shifting to one where many Hong Kong protestors are willing and prepared to die for the cause of keeping Mainland Chinese influence out, and with calls to find an impactful and permanent solution to Mainland Chinese interference, rather than small- scale measures. A rare slogan, calling for complete independence rather than more control, became the unifying chant of the protests, while the concept of \\"laam chau\\" gained momentum. This is the ideology of taking Hong Kong down and dragging Mainland China with it. One protestor said: \\"If the Chinese army comes out, we will celebrate. The entire Hong Kong business environment will collapse. If they call the military here, it would ruin Hong Kong and also mainland China's economy\\". = Economy and stock market = Losses of about 5% were recorded in on the Hang Seng Index (the worst day since 2015), and some Japanese stocks also fell. Carrie Lam denied that the losses were due to the decision, attributing them to usual \\"ups and downs\\" in the market. China has sought to assure international investors that they will not be affected. Hang Seng Index regained lost ground a week later. =Migration= Some Hong Kong citizens began looking for ways to emigrate and leave Hong Kong, feeling that the law would fundamentally damage their rights of expression and freedom. 10 times the usual number of web searches about emigration were recorded after the decision was announced. The Taiwanese government said that they would help anyone leaving Hong Kong find passage away; China threatened \\"all means\\" against Taiwan but also said violence would be a last resort. SCMP reported that after the decision on the law, the number of Hong Kong residents speaking to estate agents about properties in the United Kingdom (UK) rose rapidly. One article compared it to the mass exodus seen before the 1997 handover, also saying that local estate agents were cutting the asking prices for Hong Kong properties to keep business. Another SCMP article noted that the British announcement of BNO extension plans likely contributed to the rise in searches for UK homes specifically, with properties in London, Birmingham and Manchester being especially desirable. It quoted an estate agent who said that the demand for UK properties had, over a few days, reached where it was at its peak during the 2019 protests and before the pandemic. Immigration agencies in Hong Kong also saw a jump in inquiries, with one company seeing \\"a four to fivefold increase in cases\\", citing a new urgency, with people asking for the visa that will be approved the fastest. Estate agencies report an increase in interest in Singapore for high net worth individuals, with families increasingly asking about the UK, Australia, and Canada. = Statements = Supporters  Chief Executive Carrie Lam said that the Hong Kong government would fully cooperate with Beijing. Andrew Leung, the President of the LegCo, and Martin Liao, pro-establishment LegCo convener, also expressed support. Lam said that any national security law enacted would not affect the \\"legitimate rights and freedoms\\" of Hong Kong people, and said that its enactment by inclusion in Annex III of the Basic Law (see above) was entirely legitimate. Paul Kwong the Archbishop and Primate of the Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui (the Anglican province of Hong Kong), and , the president of the Hong Kong Buddhist Association, called the decision a necessary move. Chen Daoxiang, the PLA commander in Hong Kong, said that his garrison would safeguard \\"national sovereignty and development interests\\", and that the national security law to be drafted and enacted under the decision was \\"conducive to deter separatist forces and external intervention\\". The New York Times reported that state media painted laws proposed by the decision as \\"necessary to protect the rule of the Communist Party\\" and were strongly supportive of the law.  Opponents  District Councils joint meeting on 6 June 2020, councillors displayed signboards demanding the withdrawal of the national security law. The Hong Kong Bar Association issued a statement raising two concerns as to the nature of the law proposed by the decision. First, the association suggested that consultation was inadequate and that there was no guarantee that any eventual law would comply with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which is \\"entrenched in the Basic Law\\". Second, the presence of mainland Chinese security organs mooted by Article 4 of the Decision did not make clear whether their agents would be required to comply with Hong Kong law, or how their deployment could be compatible with Article 22(1) of the Basic Law, which proscribes interference in affairs administered by the HKSAR 'on its own'. On 6 June 2020, 17 out 18 District Councils unprecedentedly held a joint meeting to discuss the legislation of the national security law, with 329 out of 458 councillors attending. All 17 District Councils passed the motion to demand the withdrawal of the national security law. The convener Clarisse Yeung, who is also the chairwoman of the Wan Chai District Council, stated that the result of the meeting reflects the real public opinion in Hong Kong. Several members of the pan-democratic camp expressed concern. Lee Cheuk-yan said that the law could be used as an arbitrary \\"one-size-fits-all\\" charge against activists, citing Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo's prison sentence of 11 years for \\"inciting subversion\\". Tanya Chan, the convener of pro-democratic camp, commented that the drafted decision confirmed that Hong Kong is changing from \\"One country, Two systems\\" to \\"One country, One system\\", saying that the Chinese government is intervening in Hong Kong matters in all aspects. Social activist Joshua Wong said that China was trying to sever the connections of Hong Kong with the international community. Jimmy Sham, convener of the Civil Human Rights Front, also attacked the law, comparing it to a \\"nuclear weapon\\".  International responses  Among other responses, the United States prominently announced that it would revoke Hong Kong's special trade status on 27 May. Pompeo called the NPCSC decision the \\"latest in a series of actions that fundamentally undermine Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms\\". On 19 June 2020, the European Parliament adopted a resolution condemning Beijing‚Äôs unilateral introduction of the national security legislation in Hong Kong, and called for the finalization of the EU Global Human Rights Sanctions Mechanism, which could be used to impose Magnitsky-style sanctions, for example assets freezing, on Chinese officials responsible for the national security legislation.

Biography  El√≠sio de Moura is notable for the teaching and research of psychiatry and neurology, having contributed, in the beginning of the Republic, to the maintenance of the teaching of Medicine at the University of Coimbra, which was at risk of moving to the new University of Lisbon and University of Porto. El√≠sio de Moura was the son of Jos√© Alves de Moura, who studied theology, and subsequently became a professor and rector of the Liceu de Braga (currently Escola Secund√°ria S√° de Miranda, and his wife Em√≠lia da Costa Pereira de Azevedo. He was the only one of his parents' ten children to pursue medicine. On October 15, 1892, at the age of fifteen, he enrolled at the University of Coimbra, as a student at the Faculties of Mathematics and Philosophy. On July 10, 1895, he obtained a Bachelor's degree in philosophy. He then enrolled at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Coimbra, attending the course of medicine from 1895 to 1901. On March 1, 1901 he completed the degree. After graduating with distinction, he was appointed substitute professor at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Coimbra in 1902. Later, as a full professor, he taught internal pathology, medical propaedeutics, obstetrics, and pediatrics. It was the conducting of the courses in internal pathology and Internal Medicine that motivated El√≠sio de Moura to study Neurology and Psychiatry. In 1907, he began teaching neurology and psychiatry at the University of Coimbra. Along with research and teaching, the doctor also devoted part of his time to the foundation and direction of what is today known as Casa da Inf√¢ncia Dr El√≠sio de Moura in Coimbra. In 1939, his colleagues elected him to become first President of the Portuguese Medical Association. On 5 June 1947, he was made Grand Officer of the Military Order of Sant'Iago da Espada.

The episode was written and directed by Alec Berg and originally aired on HBO on December 8, 2019. In the episode, the Pied Piper team attempts to sabotage the company's million-dollar launch in order to prevent the decentralized system from potentially abolishing internet privacy. Plot After their surprising success at RussFest, Pied Piper strikes a $100 million dollar deal with AT&T; to build their decentralized internet on their platform. As the team celebrates, Monica (Amanda Crew) gives Richard (Thomas Middleditch) a framed screenshot of their text conversation as a gift. However, Richard discovers that one of the text messages he sent containing a punctual error was auto- corrected, although messages between Monica and him were encrypted. Richard spends the night trying to find out how the correction was made and tells the team about it the next morning. The team realizes that PiperNet's AI compression abilities have become so advanced that it can bypass numerous advanced encryptions, potentially eradicating all privacy measures. Realizing the severity of its potential, Gilfoyle (Martin Starr) proposes that the only way to prevent PiperNet from abolishing privacy is to sabotage it at its launch. After initial opposition, Richard reluctantly agrees to sabotage PiperNet. But Dinesh (Kumail Nanjiani) recuses himself from the effort, thinking that his pride would prevent the sabotage from going through. On the day of the launch at Salesforce Tower, Gilfoyle sets up faulty code that will sabotage the launch through widespread disruption of satellite signals. But back at Pied Piper headquarters, staff member Gabe discovers the faulty code and reverts it. He notifies Dinesh, who is outside the launch event and is given the hard drive containing the faulty code by Gabe. Dinesh is forced to physically head to the top of the Tower through stairs and manages to upload the faulty code after a last-minute grant of access by Gilfoyle. The faulty code does not disrupt satellite signals but instead causes thousands of rats to emerge onto the streets of major cities across the country. Soon afterwards, Richard shuts down Pied Piper permanently in shame. In a documentary produced 10 years after the PiperNet launch, the fates of the characters are shown: Richard has become a professor at Stanford University, where Big Head (Josh Brener) serves as President, Dinesh and Gilfoyle are running a large cybersecurity firm together, Monica is working for the NSA, Jared (Zach Woods) works at a nursing home, Russ Hanneman (Chris Diamantopoulos) has made his fortune back, Laurie Bream (Suzanne Cryer) is serving time in prison, and Gavin Belson (Matt Ross) is a bestselling romance novelist. Jian-Yang (Jimmy O. Yang) has also fully assumed the identity of Erlich and has faked his own death in order to hide with his fortune in a foreign country. The Pied Piper team reunites at the Hacker Hostel, now occupied by another family, and sits around the old dining table where they used to work to play a game of \\"always blue\\" together. The episode ends with Richard attempting to show the documentary crew the hard drive containing the Pied Piper compression algorithm but fails to find it as the credits roll. Production The episode was written and directed by Alec Berg, one of the show's executive producers. Berg also plays the documentarian interviewing the characters ten years after the initial PiperNet launch. An extended version of the documentary showing the fate of the Pied Piper team ten years afterward can be viewed on YouTube. Reception Les Chappell of The A.V. Club gave the episode an \\"A\\" rating, calling it \\"one of the darkest and most far-reaching episodes the series has ever put together\\" and \\"an episode that‚Äôs fully aware of its place in the series, winks and nods to the canon that lead it to a feeling of closure.\\" Brian Lowry of CNN also gave the episode a positive review, calling the episode a fitting send-off that \\"carried with it an unexpectedly sobering cautionary tale about the dangers of technology run amok, and ‚Äî in a timely hook ‚Äî the moral responsibilities that go with operating in this lucrative playground.\\" Writing for Slate, Josephine Wolff criticized the episode for being too cynical in \\"dismissing tech ethics and the related academic field as a big, useless joke.\\" References Category:2019 American television episodes Category:American television series finales Category:Silicon Valley (TV series) ","title":"Exit Event"},{"id":"64032286","text":"Soccer on NBC Sports is a number of television programs that have aired Association football matches in the United States on NBC and NBCSN. These matches are from International, European, and American competitions. On August 10, 2011, NBC Sports announced a new three-year broadcasting contract with Major League Soccer to produce games for the 2012 season on NBC and the NBC Sports Network. This included the broadcast of two regular season games, two playoff games, and two national team matches on NBC and 38 regular season games, three playoff games, and two national team matches on NBC Sports Network. On October 28, 2012, NBC Sports also announced a three-year, $250 million deal to televise Premier League soccer in English (primarily on NBCSN) and Spanish (on Telemundo and mun2) beginning with the 2013‚Äì14 season, replacing ESPN and Fox Soccer as the league's U.S. broadcasters. FIFA World Cup The first American coverage of the World Cup consisted only of a previously filmed telecast of the 1966 Final on NBC. The Final was aired before their coverage of the Saturday Major League Baseball Game of the Week. NBC used the black & white BBC feed and aired it on a two-hour film delay. This was the first time soccer had been shown in the United States as a stand- alone broadcast. 1986 marked the first time that the World Cup had extensive live cable and network television coverage in the United States. ESPN carried most of the weekday matches while NBC did weekend games. To be more specific, NBC aired seven matches, including the \\"Hand of God\\" quarterfinal, with broadcasters on-site. NBC's theme music for their 1986 coverage was Herb Alpert's \\"1980\\", from his 1979 album Rise. Major League Soccer On January 5, 2012, NBC Sports signed a three-year contract with Major League Soccer to nationally televise 40 matches per year, which would primarily air on the NBC Sports Network (now NBCSN), beginning with the 2012 season. All NBC telecasts included pre-game and post-game coverage, with the network intending to promote its games during broadcasts of its other major sports properties, such as the Olympics. More specifically as part of the new deal, NBC would carry three regular season and two playoff matches (the first time since 2002 that that many MLS games were to be broadcast on English-language network television), as well as 38 regular season and three playoff matches on sister channel NBCSN; both networks also aired matches featuring the United States men's national soccer team (with two games airing on each network). NBC and NBCSN's MLS telecasts during the 2013 season averaged 115,000 viewers per game, a steep drop from 2012. Looking to capitalize on further soccer opportunities, NBC Sports acquired the rights to the Premier League from Fox Soccer in 2012, in time for the 2013‚Äì14 Premier League season. Speculation abounded on if MLS was to be treated by the sports division secondarily to the Premier League, which has a greater U.S. audience than the domestic league, placing MLS' future with NBC in doubt. In 2014, negotiations broke down between NBC and MLS on a new television contract. The league instead signed an agreement with Fox Sports to serve as its U.S. broadcast partner, beginning with the 2015 season in a shared rights deal with ESPN. Premier League NBC acquired rights to the Premier League in 2013, replacing Fox Sports and ESPN. NBC's studio programming for the league includes the pre-match show Premier League Live, and the highlights shows Premier League Goal Zone and Match of the Day (modeled upon the similar BBC series). NBC Sports president of programming Jon Miller explained that their main goal was to not \\"Americanize\\" their coverage (besides providing explanations of terminology unfamiliar to U.S. viewers, such as derbies), citing their decision to employ talent (such as former ESPN UK and BBC Sport presenter Rebecca Lowe, who became NBC's lead host) who \\"know the Premier League and can talk about it intelligently\\". In 2014, NBC also hired the duo of Michael Davies and Roger Bennett‚Äîthe \\"Men in Blazers\\"‚Äîto provide soccer-oriented content across NBC Sports' platforms.  FA Women's Super League  In September 2020, NBC agreed to a season-long partnership with Atalanta Media to broadcast up to 50 FA Women's Super League matches during 2020-21 season. The plan is for 12 matches to be broadcast on NBCSN, while other matches will be available via the NBC Sports website and app. ReferencesExternal links * Category:NBC original programming Category:NBC Sports Category:NBCSN shows NBC Sports Category:American live television series NBC NBC Sports Category:Sportsworld (American TV series) ","title":"Soccer on NBC Sports"},{"id":"64032291","text":"Manuel R.

It is the national flower of Bhutan. Description Meconopsis gakyidiana is a loose tuft forming plant with short rhizomes and tall stems. Leaves are more or less alternate on the main stem and they are yellowish-green in color. Flowers are bowl shaped and they usually change color from purple to blue, often pale blue-tinged with purple. Sometimes dark red but rare. It is similar to Meconopsis baileyi but differs from it with bowl-shaped flower with the distinctly concave petals, orange- coloured thecae and longer style. Range Meconopsis gakyidiana is currently distributed across the eastern Bhutan, western Arunachal Pradesh of India, southern Xizang (Tibet) of China from 3,700‚Äì4,300m in elevation. Habitat Meconopsis gakyidiana grows in the open shrubberies, lush pastures, beside rubble walls in grazing grounds, rarely on the sunny edge of sub-alpine forests, gregariously growing together with shrubs and other tall herbs. Etymology The Meconopsis gakyidiana was earlier known widely as Meconopsis grandis. Scientifically it was classified as Meconopsis grandis subsp. orientalis in the past. This infraspecific epithet was upgraded to the current full species in 2017. The species name was derived from 'Gakyi' which is a Dzongkha word for happiness.

The 64-gun ship of the line was a type of two-decker warship defined during the 18th century, named after the number of their guns. 64-guns had a lower battery of 24-pounders, and an upper battery of 12-pounders. Heavier variants with 18-pounder on the upper deck also existed.  History  The French Navy used \\"64-gun\\" as a typology for its ships. In the British Royal Navy, such lighter two-deckers were considered to be Third-rates, like 74-guns and 80-guns. During the reign of Louis XIV, numerous ships carried 60 or 62 guns, with a lower battery pierced for 12 guns on each side. During the reign of Louis XV, standardisation efforts were undertaken to rationalise the design and construction of these ships, with a common armament of 24-pounder, 12-pounder and 8-pounder long guns. The first 64-gun in this sense was Bor√©e, launched in 1734 and pierced with 13 gun ports on each side of her lower battery.The British started copying these ships from 1764 with HMS Asia, and also stopped building 60-gun ships. British ships had a slightly heavier broadside, as they typically carried 18-pounders on their upper gundeck, while the French would usually have 12-pounders. 64-guns were no match for 74-guns, which had a 36-pounders (in France) or 32-pounders (in England) lower battery and 18-pounders on the upper gundeck (some later units even experimented with 24-pounders in the upper deck), and were usually slower than frigates. Their main advantage were their cheaper cost, and lower draft. This would be especially important for operations in India. The French built 61 of these 64-gun ships, the last one being Jason in 1779. Three were razeed, turning them into frigates capable of carrying a 24-pounder main armament, although these ships typically fell back to 18-pounders like most heavy frigates of their time.

He is the founder of Salvation Proclaimers Anointed Church (SPAC Nation), a Pentecostal Church based in London, England. He is a Yoruba by tribe and is cousin to Star Wars sequel trilogy actor, John Boyega. Early Life Tobi Adegboyega moved to London from Lagos, Nigeria in 2005. On arrival in London, he shared a room with his cousin John Boyega. Career Pastor Tobi Adegboyega started SPAC Nation in 2008. The church was started with three members. The church is based in Croydon, South London. As Pastor, he encourages criminals to drop their weapons at the altar of his church during services, an act that received both praise and criticism from the public. On 20 May 2020, Tobi Adegboyega stepped down as Lead Pastor of SPAC Nation and handed over to Samuel Akokhia and Damy Balogun. The announcement was made via the church's official Twitter handle. Controversies A BBC Panorama investigation accused SPAC Nation, Pastor Tobi Adegboyega, and other leaders of the church of financially exploiting members of the church. In the investigation, they interviewed some members of the church who accused the church and suggested Pastor Tobi be held accountable. Panorama later released a video of Pastor Tobi, quoted to say he believed it was ‚Äúno big deal‚Äù for members of the church to give at least ¬£1,000 a month to the church, and that he needed to make ¬£1million monthly. A member of the church, Nino claimed he was asked for ¬£20,000 by Pastor Tobi, who said he needed it for an investment. While the church denied these allegations, Pastor Tobi declined an interview with BBC Panorama. In January 2020, his church was accused of financial exploitation and fraud by Croydon North MP Steve Reed, but as at February 2020, the police said they would not launch a criminal enquiry. Many other allegations of financial misappropriation, fraud, domestic abuse, sexual abuse have been raised up against his church, SPAC Nation and pastors of the church. Philanthropy In 2018, Victoria Derbyshire did a piece on SPAC Nation and found out that Pastor Tobi Adegboyega had 14 ex-criminals living with him at that time. At the release of these convicts from prison, he takes them in with the aim of making sure they don't fall back to crime. He encourages former gang members to drop their weapons at the altar during services and gives them new means of life. In 2019, he announced his readiness to alleviate poverty among youths in Lagos State with creation of jobs through the waste management business. In March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, he sent relief materials to the less deprived, most populated communities and villages in Nigeria, Ghana and Tanzania. The same gesture was replicated in some states of the UK and Europe. He hosted a breakfast with the Financial Times with other leaders present to discuss opportunities available to Nigerian youths.

The town hall is named after Mangaldas Girdhardas, a textile industrialist.  History  The town hall was constructed in 1930s as a memorial to Mangaldas Girdhardas, a noted textile industrialist in the 20th century, with funds donated by the citizens. It is owned by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. It was renovated in the 1960s under B. V. Doshi. He had opted for a false ceiling for better acoustics. Extensive renovation was carried out in 1997-98 under architect Kamal Mangaldas, a grandson of Mangaldas Girdhardas. He removed the false ceiling and added a podium around the original building.  Architecture  The town hall was designed by British architect Claude Batley in 1939, who also designed the M. J. Library next to it. It is an example of an Art Deco building. The plan of the building is designed by using two rotating squares placed at 45 degrees forming a star-shape. The resulting octagonal space is designed as a seating area. Rectangles are added to the front and rear of the central square which formed a vestibule and a stage respectively. The star- shaped building is capped by a dome on an octagonal space. The whole plan takes inspiration from the mandapas of Gujarati Hindu temples. The exterior has exposed bricks with stepped back corners invoking the complex exterior of Hindu temples. The thick walls were constructed from bricks and an octagonal concrete dome was constructed over it. The Chajja and ornate grills in the structure show influence of Gujarati architectural heritage.

He was known as one of the most prolific hunters of Amur tigers and wrote a book on tiger hunting in 1940 called –ü–æ–ª–≤–µ–∫–∞ –æ—Ö–æ—Ç—ã –Ω–∞ —Ç–∏–≥—Ä–æ–≤ [Half a Century of Tiger Hunting]. The family moved from Sidemi, in Primorsky Krai across the border into northern Korea following in 1922. After the Soviets entered northern Korea, he was arrested in 1945 and sent to the Siberian Gulags where he died. His life became better known to the English speaking world after a biography, The Tiger's Claw, written by English actress in Korea, Mary Linley Taylor, was published in 1956.  Biography  left Yuri was born on Askold Island to the Polish settler Micha≈Ç Jankowski and Olga Kuzniecowa. At the age of twenty Yuri went to America along with his half- brother Alexander. He studied horse breeding in Texas, volunteered at the Agricultural University of Champaign, Illinois, and brought English purebreds by ship from San Francisco to his father's estate in Sidemi. Like the rest of the family, he was a keen hunter and became famous for shooting tigers that often came to prey on their horses. The Koreans in the Sidemi area called Yuri as ‚ÄúNenuni Ateri‚Äù (the son of the four-eyed) as his father was called nenuni for his keen eyesight. Yuri married Margarita, the oldest daughter of the shipping entrepreneur Mikhail G. Shevelev in 1907 and they had three sons and two daughters. All the children learned to ride horses and George helped establish a race track in Vladivostok. In 1919, their daughter Muza raced in Vladivostok and won. Following the Russian revolution, the Jankowski family had to leave their home in Sidimi, Primorsky Krai in 1922 and moved not far away from the border to northern Korea where the George sold nearly all his belongings in Harbin. Some years later they established an estate called Novina. The family made this a resort, mainly for exiled Russians. As a young boy, Yul Brynner spent his summers at the resort. They also earned a living raising deer and horses as they had done before. When the Japanese moved into the Korean region, the family supplied meat to the army. His wife died in 1936 and he married again in 1941 to Olga Petrovna Archegova from Shanghai. In 1945, the Soviet army entered northern Korea and since they had been supporting the enemy, the Japanese troops. Yuri was arrested and sent to the Gulags. Some of the family including son Arseny, and daughters Victoria and Muza escaped through the south of Korea and then emigrated to the United States of America. Arseny, with his knowledge of Japanese, Korean, Russian and English, was recruited by the CIA on the recommendation of David Murphy and went under the name of Andy Brown handling a network of Korean operatives including No Kum-sok. When many of his operatives were captured, a molehunt began within the CIA and several operatives were dismissed. This included a CIA officer Edgar Snow who was married to Anastasia \\"Nata\\" Sokolovskaya, daughter of Arseny's wife Olga Sokolovskaya from her earlier marriage. Another CIA operative who was dismissed was Vivian L. Parker, who had married a cousin of Arseny, Marianne. As \\"White Russians\\" with no love for communism, the family held that Arseny's dismissal was unfair. George's son Valery was arrested by the Soviets and he managed to contact his father while in the Gulags. He survived and after rehabilitation, wrote several books on the life of the family. George died just two months before his release was due. George was posthumously rehabilitated on June 22, 1990. = Hunting and outdoor life = George's first experience with tigers was when he was taken by his father at the age of 11 to track a tiger that had killed one of their horses. In 1894 he went on a collecting expedition for butterflies to northern Korea along with his brother Alexander. This had been on the request of Grand Duke Nikolai Mikhailovich to his father. They had to put out sheets and lights to trap insects and one of the brothers had to stand on guard with a gun at the ready. His first tiger hunt was on their Yankovsky Peninsula with his brother and one of their workers Plato was injured when the wounded tiger attacked. He wrote of narrow escapes from leopards and tigers. In the fall of 1920 Yuri recorded that many bears from Manchuria entered the Sidemi area. Yuri wrote about his hunting in his 1940 book and had hoped to write more but the manuscripts which he kept while in labour camp which weighed two pounds are thought to have been burned after his death. His son Valery also wrote about his father's hunting. A biography of George was published by Mary Linley Taylor in English as The Tiger's Claw: The Life-Story of George Yankovsky East Asia's Mighty Hunter in 1956.

In 2012, he was hired by Yahoo news as its first White House correspondent and later became its chief Washington correspondent. He also hosted a weekly political round-table show on P.O.T.U.S. for three years on behalf of Yahoo News. In 2018, he was named the new chief Washington correspondent for SiriusXM. He returned to the P.O.T.U.S. channel and is now hosting a radio talk show called \\"The Big Picture\\". He was elected president of the White House Correspondents' Association from 2018 to 2019, beating Major Garrett of CBS News, 121 to 90 votes. During the White House Correspondents Dinner of 2019, he announced an annual prize of $25,000 for the best piece of investigative political journalism focused on accountability in state government. In preparation of the dinner that year, Knox broke with tradition by making a departure from the lighthearted and star-studded atmosphere of previous years' dinners and giving it a more serious tone with the invitation of historian and biographer Ron Chernow, instead of a professional comedian, as the featured speaker. The dinner also saw reduced attendance of Hollywood celebrities from previous years. Knox welcomed those changes, saying that he wanted to return the event to its original roots and do away with the \\"celebrification\\" of the dinner.  Personal life  Knox lives in Bethesda, Maryland with his wife, Jennifer Lewis, and their son. He is the son of Middlebury College professors Edward C. Knox and the late Huguette-Laure Knox, both of whom taught in the French Department. His father is American and his mother is French. He was born in Vermont, but grew up in both France and the United States.

The Leiths acquired the property. The house was remodelled in 1785, and about 1900, to a design by Sydney Mitchell. Structure The rebuilt building, Glenkindie House, is a U-plan house, with the opening to the south. The oldest wing, which may date from the 16th century, is the east wing, and it has two storeys and an attic. A matching wing was built in the 17th century, but the main house, on the site of the original castle, dates from the 19th century.

It operates safe rooms in courts and free legal advocacy and support services to women seeking protection orders in relation to domestic violence. WDVCAS is a key front line domestic violence support service.  History  The Women's Domestic Violence Court Assistance Scheme (WDVCAS) was originally established by Redfern Legal Centre in March 1990 to provide a range of specialist legal and support services to women at court seeking Apprehended Violence Orders (AVOs). The Principles and Guidelines of the Scheme required that it be operated by paid staff, who were to be women wherever practicable, and would provide a holistic service including court advocacy to those who were otherwise unrepresented. The model was firmly based on a feminist philosophy. The scheme initially operated once a week on summons day (Wednesdays) at Redfern Local Court and involved a solicitor and two support workers providing service exclusively to women seeking AVOs. In addition to legal representation, WDVCAS staff assisted women with a range of needs: financial, housing, emotional support and counselling and other legal problems. The scheme co-ordinated assistance from a variety of services to provide women with the holistic support needed for them to attempt change. The scheme had the support of the local magistrate, Lillian Horler, and the court provided exclusive use of a room to minimise the risk of threats or intimidation within the environs of the court. With the assistance of the Chamber Magistrate Service, the WDVCAS were able to assist women bring many successful applications for their protection in circumstances where police had failed to act. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted and launched by Justice Elizabeth Evatt in August 1991 and recorded the considerable success of the scheme in increasing the numbers of orders secured for the protection of women. The model, including the concept of a safe room, was subsequently expanded and adapted to the conditions and resources available at other local courts, not only in NSW but in other parts of Australia. By 1993 there were 21 community-based organisations participating in the scheme and WDVCASs were spreading quickly. There was also an increase in the use of the Chamber Magistrate Service to assist in drafting private applications in relation to domestic or personal violence, accounting for 25% of their work. This level of service was subsequently discontinued. The original WDVCAS service at Redfern Local Court was also brought to an end in 2004 with the winding down and closure of that courthouse, despite widespread protest. In 1996 the Legal Aid Commission of NSW provided funding to the Women's Legal Resources Centre (now Women's Legal Service NSW) to provide training, resources and administrative support to the growing numbers of WDVCASs. However, administration of the WDVCAS scheme was subsequently taken over by Legal Aid NSW and the scheme renamed the Women's Domestic Violence Court Advocacy Service, still with the acronym WDVCAS. Demand for the service continued to grow but there was an ongoing struggle to secure adequate funding to meet the demand. By 2018, Legal Aid NSW was administering funding to 29 WDVCAS across the State of NSW operated by a variety of locally-based, incorporated, not-for-profit, NGOs. Service was being provided to women attending 117 Local Courts, with solicitors supplied through Legal Aid's Domestic Violence Practitioner Service. A peak body, WDVCAS Inc. was established with funding from Legal Aid in 2011 (subsequently renamed Women's Safety NSW) and began to engage more closely with government agencies including the Department of the Attorney- General and Justice, NSW Victims Services, FACS and NSW Police. In 2015 the Safer Pathways program was introduced which involved WDVCAS working with a team of workers from NSW Police and other government agencies to hold regular Safety Action Meetings (SAM), chaired by police, with the purpose of sharing information and making plans in relation to women identified as being at \\"serious risk\\". A Domestic Violence Safety Assessment Tool (DVSAT) was developed for, and administered by police to identify the level of threat to domestic and family violence victims. A system was also introduced for police to refer every domestic violence incident to WDVCAS to provide a response within one working day. However, funding was not increased to meet the increased demand for WDVCAS services generated by this change. Research conducted by BOCSAR subsequently demonstrated that the DVSAT and the Safer Pathway program were ineffective. An evaluation commissioned by government also documented a reluctance to engage in the Safer Pathways program, particularly within the Aboriginal community, due to the involvement of the police. Legal Aid NSW and others have documented that inadequate responses by NSW Police, including an increasing number of women being inappropriately identified as defendants in relation to domestic violence matters, continues to act as a deterrent for women seeking help. In 2018 the WDVCASs around the State of NSW were put out to tender by the NSW Attorney General, Mark Speakman, in a manner similar to that used to dismantle the underpinnings of the NSW Women's Refuge Movement. This move by government caused concern throughout the sector and saw Redfern Legal Centre bow out of the process. The tender process was abruptly cancelled part way but was re-instituted for many of the services in 2020 following re-election of the NSW Liberal Government.

Such a law is required under Article 23 of the Hong Kong Basic Law, which came into force in 1997 and stipulates that the law should be enacted by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. In June 2020, a partially equivalent law was enacted by the Chinese Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, rather than by the Hong Kong Legislative Council. During British rule, the colonial government had attempted to pass security legislation. An attempt made in 2003 by Hong Kong to fulfill legislation under Article 23 did not succeed after mass demonstrations. Both the 2003 and 2020 attempts at legislation occurred during coronavirus outbreaks (SARS and COVID-19, respectively), with each exacerbating the negative response to the proposals. The text of the law has drawn strong criticism from Western countries and others such as Japan, prompting measures to accept Hong Kong migrants in increasing numbers by the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Taiwan. Cuba and 52 other countries expressed their support for the law at the United Nations Human Rights Council, with 27 countries expressing their opposition. The controversial law has also garnered particular attention to its Article 38, which states that that the law is applicable also to those who are not permanent residents of Hong Kong, and to those who do not reside there; these formulations have been interpreted by some as saying that it is applicable to every individual in the world. Background Article 23 of Hong Kong's Basic Law provides that Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will \\"enact laws on its own\\" for the Region's security and to prevent political bodies outside the Region from \\"conducting political activities in the Region\\" or otherwise interfering with Hong Kong's independent security: A national security law would relate to three ordinances that make up Hong Kong's penal law, the Official Secrets Ordinance, Crimes Ordinance and Societies Ordinance. The Societies Ordinance in particular covers elements of security, as it was intended to prevent the creation of criminal secret societies and triads. In 1949, with the influx of migrants from China, it was reintroduced and amended to specifically mention \\"foreign political organisations\\". The Crimes Ordinance covers the handling of dissent within the region. In place since 1971, and never amended, the ordinance sets a legal standard allowing people to be imprisoned simply for handling material deemed to be against the government, without need for evidence. The Hong Kong Bill of Rights ensures freedom of speech, but Hong Kong barrister Wilson Leung has said that China may find a way to override this in legislation they introduce. Leung cites the fact a law imposed by China would be considered national law ‚Äì while the Hong Kong Bill of Rights is \\"local\\" and so would be deemed subordinate by Beijing ‚Äì and that the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) is the highest authority on interpreting the Basic Law, and so could \\"say that the new security law cannot be restrained by the Bill of Rights\\" if they want. National security legislation in Mainland China is controversial outside the country. First implemented in 1993, China's national security law became more restrictive under Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping, who set up a National Security Commission (that he heads himself) shortly after he came to power. Past legislation attempts1992‚Äì1997= Lord Patten of Barnes, who had been appointed Governor of Hong Kong in 1992 to oversee the last years of British rule and the handover. Under his leadership, social and democratic reforms were introduced to the territory. Societies Ordinance After the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, with Hong Kong residents concerned over their civil liberties, the Societies Ordinance was reviewed; it was amended in 1992, relaxing some of the restrictions against being able to register some societies, but this was repealed after the handover in 1997. According to the Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor (HRM), China amended the ordinance in 1997 \\"as part of a package of China's effort to emasculate the Hong Kong Bill of Rights\\". The 1997 amendments include the proviso that should the relevant officials \\"reasonably believe\\" that prohibiting a society \\"is necessary in the interests of national security or public safety, public order (ordre public) or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others\\", it can be banned without evidence. HRM said that: The international response to this 'national security law' was to invoke the Siracusa Principles, which says that national security \\"cannot be invoked as a reason for imposing limitations to prevent merely local or relatively isolated threats to law and order\\", only against outside threats. International jurists declared that including 'national security' in the ordinance dealing with local societies was unwarranted and inappropriate because \\"it is difficult to suggest that a society or a demonstration in Hong Kong will threaten the existence of China\\", and any local threat can be handled with normal public order laws. Despite this, the 'national security' ground was introduced. While \\"national security\\" was defined as \\"safeguarding of the territorial integrity and the independence of the People's Republic of China\\", there was no explanation of what constituted a threat to this, nor how it should be implemented. Crimes Ordinance In December 1996, the Hong Kong Legislative Council (as part of the British colonial government) introduced the Crimes (Amendment)(No.2) Bill 1996. The catalyst for introduction was the forthcoming handover, with the initial amendments being mostly technical and removing reference to the monarchy. In turn, it sought proposals to change the articles on treasonable offences. This bill would have amended the Crimes Ordinance, changing sedition legislation that had existed since 1971 and was described by Hong Kong as \\"archaic\\". Specifically, the bill proposed legalising dissent of the government, with the council declaring that the existing ordinance \\"[was] contrary to the development of democracy [as it] criminalizes speech or writing and may be used as a weapon against legitimate criticism of the government\\". The bill failed as it was strongly opposed by Beijing, leaving a gap in national security legislation. A \\"scaled-down\\" version of the Crimes Ordinance amendment was pushed through. It gave a more limited definition of \\"sedition\\" and increased territorial defences; it was signed by Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten days before the 1997 handover, but was quickly discarded by the Chinese before it could ever come into effect. =2003= Tung Chee-hwa was responsible for Hong Kong's failed legislation attempt. Protests in June and July 2003 were in part due to the economic downturn after, and mishandling of, the 2002‚Äì2004 SARS outbreak. In September 2002, the Hong Kong government released its \\"Proposals to Implement Article 23 of the Basic Law\\" Consultation Document. Consultation lasted until December 2002, being concluded early after protests drew tens of thousands of people against the proposal; concessions were made, but the proposals did not return to public consultation. The National Security (Legislative Provisions) Bill 2003 was introduced in February 2003, aiming to comply with the requirement under Article 23 that the Hong Kong government should enact national security legislation \\"on its own\\". However, the bill was abandoned due to overwhelming opposition, noting the unprecedented number of protesters. The 2003 bill would introduce sedition legislation, as well as offer amendments to the ordinances. While the Region was being encouraged to create legislation in line with the Johannesburg Principles, it did not, and the 2003 provisions would have been more restrictive of civil liberties. The changes were: to narrow the definition of \\"sedition\\", requiring someone to deliberately commit acts against the government; to add a 'likelihood' clause, requiring a burden of proof; and to add subversion and secession offences. This last addition was the most problematic part of the bill, with the others seen as steps towards protection. The subversion and secession legislation would make it illegal to threaten the presence and stability of the People's Republic of China (PRC) under laws handling treason and war, and also used vague and undefined terms that left the legal threshold for prosecution unclear. Though the bill had been introduced in February 2003, Asia was experiencing the SARS epidemic, and major protest towards it did not happen until Hong Kong recovered at the start of June. In June 2003, the pro-democracy camp mobilised the public to oppose the bill, and on 1 July, the sixth anniversary of the handover, more than a half million Hong Kong residents took to the streets against Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa and Secretary for Security Regina Ip, who was in charge of the bill. In the evening of 6 July, Liberal Party chairman James Tien decided to withdraw from the \\"governing coalition\\" by resigning from the Executive Council in protest. Knowing that the bill would not be passed without the Liberal Party, the government finally decided to postpone it, before it was shelved indefinitely. =2010s= Pro-Beijing Hong Kong politicians have spoken about the proposed law since independence movements grew in Hong Kong. When China announced that \\"[Beijing] will absolutely neither permit anyone advocating secession in Hong Kong nor allow any pro-independence activists to enter a government institution\\", Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying said Hong Kong would enact a security law targeting pro-independence movement in Hong Kong. In 2018 Wang Zhimin, director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in Hong Kong, urged the Hong Kong government to enact national security legislation as he said \\"Hong Kong is the only place in the world without a national security legislation ‚Äì it's a major weakness in the nation's overall security, and it has a direct impact on residents\\". Prelude to legislation In 2019, the Hong Kong government introduced an extradition law amendment bill proposing to allow extradition to countries and territories that have no formal extradition agreements with Hong Kong, including Taiwan and Mainland China, in certain circumstances. The bill sparked continuing protests, and was later withdrawn. The South China Morning Post reported that the Chinese central government believed that the political climate in Hong Kong, due to the protests, precludes the passage of national security legislation under Article 23, while Chief Executive Carrie Lam added that the protests made the law more necessary than before, and so China resorted to enactment of security measures through the National People's Congress (NPC) instead. On 15 April, the head of the liaison office in Hong Kong, Luo Huining, called for the rapid passing of a national security law for the city. On 18 June 2020, the Chinese government introduced a draft to the NPC, aiming for the session to take three days. This is a much more rapid process than bills in the NPC, which go through three different rounds of approval. =NPCSC decision= On 22 May 2020, the NPC approved a decision to authorise the NPCSC to enact a national security law for Hong Kong if Hong Kong did not \\"legislate national security law according to the Basic Law as soon as possible\\".Article 3 of the National People's Congress Decision on Hong Kong national security legislation The decision authorises the NPCSC to enact laws for \\"a sound legal system\\" in the territory. An NPCSC deputy claims that the Article 23 legislative provisions still have to be passed by August 2021. =Detentions under the national security law= The first documented political detention happened on July 29 when 19-year-old Tony Chung was arrested, suspected of inciting secession. Up to the end of September 2020, a total of 26 individuals had been arrested under the law. Initial responses and analysesAnalysis of Chinese government involvement= Liu He meeting with US president Donald Trump in May 2018. The two nations' deteriorating relations have been suggested as a cause for the Chinese government imposing more restrictions on Hong Kong. Brian Fong, a political analyst in Hong Kong-Mainland Chinese relations, explains that the move is a dramatic change in Chinese policy, and a risky one that could lead to Beijing \\"losing access to foreign capital and technology through Hong Kong\\". The American diplomat of Asian affairs Daniel R. Russel wrote in The Diplomat on 3 June 2020 that China was \\"fully aware of both the local and the international reaction it could expect\\" when the NPC passed its decision about the legislation. Russel explained that the reaction in 2003, the 2019 protests, and some US sanctions favouring Hong Kong over Mainland China set the baseline for response to the decision. He also noted that China's reputation was already low internationally because of the COVID-19 pandemic (noting that, \\"ironically\\", it was in the same position as in 2003 with SARS and the legislation), especially in the US where \\"public attitudes toward the other nation have taken a sharp turn for the worse\\" because of the pandemic that originated in China. However, he added that Beijing had at the time an \\"increased level of resolve [and] tolerance for negative consequences\\"; he wrote that forceful economic action from the US may prompt the Chinese government to retaliate with military action in Hong Kong, suggesting that both nations have a disregard for the territory if it can be used for benefit in their trade war and warning that \\"Hong Kong may be martyred in the process\\". Sir Malcolm Rifkind, British Foreign Secretary at the time of the handover, said in June 2020: \\"China does have an Achilles' heel when it comes to Hong Kong. If China pushes too far with what they are seeking to do, they will not absorb a prosperous significant financially important Hong Kong into the body of China. They will be left with a hollow shell\\". On 9 June 2020, The Guardian's China specialists Tania Branigan and Lily Kuo published a report titled \\"How Hong Kong caught fire: the story of a radical uprising\\". In it, they wrote that \\"the nature of [Chinese government involvement] is as alarming as its content: it sets a precedent of Beijing forcing unpopular legislation on Hong Kong\\", in open defiance of the handover terms. They also look at the approach of the law, explaining that Beijing has given \\"material security in place of political freedoms\\" to its people in Mainland China, and plans to do the same in Hong Kong because it sees all issues as purely economical and protests only escalating because of \\"troublemakers and hostile foreign powers\\". In terms of how it is being executed, the pair assert that in 2020, \\"Beijing has abandoned any pretence of winning hearts and minds\\", instead using force to prevent democracy politicians and activists from having platforms, which Branigan and Kuo say is a plan to use fear to suppress Hong Kong, as \\"persuasion\\" has not worked. The Chinese government's legal basis for involvement comes from the Chinese constitution declaring Hong Kong part of China, and Article 18 of the Hong Kong Basic Law allowing for Chinese laws to be valid in Hong Kong if they are included in Annex III. Deutsche Welle expects that the NPCSC national security law will stand as a Chinese national law that applies to Hong Kong, as it will be added to Annex III; Dang Yuan wrote for Deutsche Welle that \\"Beijing wants to maintain the appearance of Hong Kong's autonomy and continues to insist that Hong Kong pass its 'own' corresponding law\\" in alignment with the NPCSC legislation. Deutsche Welle wrote that China chose mid-2020 as the time to intervene with a restrictive law because of the likelihood of a democratic majority winning in the Hong Kong elections in September, meaning another Hong Kong attempt at a national security law would be unlikely. =Hong Kong= Signs protesting the law held up by Hong Kong lawmakers at a joint meeting held by seventeen Hong Kong District Councils on 6 June 2020. Three prominent pro-democracy activists Nathan Law (left), Agnes Chow (middle), and Joshua Wong (right) left their party Demosist≈ç on 30 June. Later that day, the party announced that it would disband with immediate effect. A large number of Hong Kong residents opposed the Chinese government proposals. The prospect of any national security law has always been unpopular, but protesters in 2020 said that the new proposals \\"strikes at the heart of Hong Kong's civic political identity, its success as an international hub. But most of all it strikes at people's sense of belonging\\". Some Hong Kong opponents of the law hope it will cause other countries to revoke their special treatment toward Hong Kong, which will in turn damage China's economy, using the Cantonese slang term lam chau to describe this. The Hong Kong Bar Association, the city's professional body representing its barristers, issued a statement saying that it was \\"gravely concerned with both the contents of the [national security law] and the manner of its introduction.\\" The statement noted that the law was enacted in a way that prevented the city's lawyers, judges, police and residents from understanding its contents in any way prior to its coming into force. The Hong Kong politician Margaret Ng believes that the Chinese government has wanted to implement a national security law in Hong Kong under their terms for years, and are using the 2019 protests as an excuse, saying that \\"China has always found it difficult to accept the kind of freedom and restraint to power that Hong Kong has under a separate system\\". Man-Kei Tam, the Hong Kong director of Amnesty International, described the Chinese legislation as \\"Orwellian\\". In light of the passing of the national security law on 30 June, prominent democracy activists Joshua Wong, Nathan Law, Agnes Chow, and Jeffrey Ngo announced that they would be leaving Demosist≈ç, which had been involved in lobbying in the US for the passing of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act and the suspension of the city's special trade status. Shortly afterward, Demosist≈ç was disbanded and all operations were ceased. Two other pro-independent groups announced that they had ended their operations in Hong Kong, fearing that they would be the targets of the new law. Nathan Law fled the country shortly afterwards. Adrian Brown from Al Jazeera observed the passing of the law created a chilling effect in the city. According to him, when his team began interviewing ordinary people about their opinions on the passing of the law, many of them declined to comment, a phenomenon which he perceived to be \\"unusual\\". Though the law was not retroactive, many Hong Kong people deleted pro-democracy social media posts and accounts, and asked journalists to destroy evidence of previous conversations.Hong Kongers scrub social media history in face of security law Businesses participating in the yellow economy removed pro- democracy posters, Lennon Walls, and pro-democracy social media posts. Already after the passage of the NPCSC decision on 22 May, Hong Kong citizens began looking for ways to emigrate and leave Hong Kong, feeling that the law would fundamentally damage their rights of expression and freedom. Ten times the usual number of web searches about emigration were recorded after the decision was announced. Following the British announcement that it would open a route to British citizenship for Hong Kongers born under British rule, a spike in interest in properties in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada occurred. Reuters held a poll of local opinion towards the law, in June before it was implemented. The result showed that a majority of Hong Kongers opposed the law, with 49% strongly opposing it and 7% somewhat opposing it. About a third of Hong Kongers said they supported the law, with 27% strongly supporting it and 7% somewhat supporting it. The Hong Kong Research Association interviewed 1,097 adult citizens by telephone on July 2-5. 66% of the respondents support the National People‚Äôs Congress Standing Committee‚Äôs enactment of the \\"Hong Kong National Security Law\\" and its implementation in Hong Kong in Annex III of the Basic Law, while 31% do not support it; the survey also shows that 47% of the respondents believe The \\"Hong Kong National Security Law\\" has a positive impact on Hong Kong's prospects, 32% of the respondents have no impact, and 17% think it has a negative impact. The One Country, Two Systems Research Center also conducted a telephone sampling survey at the end of May and successfully interviewed 963 adult Hong Kong citizens living in Hong Kong, with an error of no more than plus or minus 3.2%. The first question is: \\"Do you think Hong Kong is responsible for safeguarding the country's security?\\" 74% of those who answered \\"Responsible\\", 16.6% of \\"No responsibility\\", and 9.5% of \\"Don't know/difficult to tell\\". =Taiwan= Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen expressed her disappointment with the controversial law and announced that a special office for coordinating humanitarian assistance to the Hong Kong people would officially open on the first of July in response to the law's passage. The Democratic Progressive Party warned that this was the end of the \\"one country, two systems\\" policy for Hong Kong and that Taiwanese people travelling to Hong Kong should take care. The head of the Mainland Affairs Council Chen Ming-tong described the law as \\"a decree issued by the Celestial Empire to the people of the world\\" due to its impacts on people worldwide not just in Hong Kong. =United Kingdom= The UK, of which Hong Kong is a former colony, encouraged China to back down on the security law per the provisions of the Sino-British Joint Declaration: terms of the UK handing sovereignty of Hong Kong to China included allowing Hong Kong to maintain autonomy and its British-based form of governance. British First Secretary and Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary Dominic Raab stated that China was violating the Joint Declaration in their attempts to pursue the law. On 3 June, the Chinese government announced that they consider the Joint Declaration to have become void as soon as power was transferred in 1997. At the start of June 2020, Raab and former Foreign Secretaries expressed the need to form a large international alliance to exert pressure on Beijing. The biannual 11 June 2019 UK Report on Hong Kong (covering the last six months of 2019) had Raab more firmly warn China against interference, as well as reiterating the UK's right to comment on Hong Kong. The report requests that China abstain from interfering in the September elections in Hong Kong, and accuses the Chinese government of torturing a former employee of the British Consulate in Hong Kong, Simon Cheng, who visited the Mainland when working at the British Consulate in Hong Kong. Six days later, the UK said that a new human rights law, which has been stalled in Whitehall for several months, could be used to \\"sanction Chinese officials if Beijing presses ahead\\" with the national security law. The British law is to be a form of Magnitsky legislation, for the government to sanction those who commit acts repressing human rights. Extending Hong Kong British national rights Hong Kong protesters flying both the Union Jack and the colonial Dragon and Lion flag in 2019. In late May and early June 2020, members of the British Cabinet also announced measures to provide a route to British citizenship for 3 million Hong Kong residents. On 3 June, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that if China were to continue pursuing the law, he would allow Hong Kong residents to claim a British National (Overseas) passport (BNO) and open a path to British citizenship for them. Raab said that the UK would sacrifice trade deals with China to support Hong Kong. Raab delivered a proposal on right of abode legislation to the House of Commons on 2 June. His measure plans to allow BNO passport holders to apply for a visa, remain in the UK for an initial period of twelve months instead of six as previously, allow them to apply to study and work, and thereby provide them a path to citizenship. Further to this proposal, Johnson's 3 June announcement would cover all of the approximately 3 million Hong Kong residents born before 1997. The extent of the scheme was clarified on 12 June 2020 by Home Secretary Priti Patel in correspondence with Johnson. All people eligible for BNO status, as well as their dependents, will be allowed to enter the UK under the scheme. This is still criticised for leaving a gap of young adults born after 1997 and who are older than 18 (no longer dependents) who will not be able to access the scheme. She added that Hong Kong residents could start to come to the UK without restrictions while the scheme is still being set up, if the national security law is passed. On 1 July, Johnson announced the full plans, extending the visa-free period. He said that all BNO passport holders and their dependents would be granted the right to remain in the UK for five years, including being free to work and study. After five years they can, under normal British nationality law, apply for settled status and then, a year later, for citizenship. =Other countries= The UK held a teleconference with its allies in the Five Eyes alliance (the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand) in the first few days of June, where they discussed the Hong Kong situation and requested that should the BNO extension go ahead, the other countries would share the burden of taking in Hong Kongers in the resulting exodus. Foreign ministers from the Five Eyes members and Commonwealth realms of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the UK jointly wrote a letter to the United Nations requesting \\"a new special envoy to monitor the impact of the law on Hong Kong\\", especially noting the Chinese security law proposal came in the week of the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. Following persuasion from the UK, all members of the G7, notably including Japan, signed an official statement both urging China to reconsider the national security law and expressing concerns about human rights in Hong Kong on 17 June 2020. Australia Australia, with strong ties to Hong Kong, notably delayed action until 9 July, when the country announced new visa and permit schemes for Hong Kongers to match the UK's offer. That same day, the Australian Government suspended Australia's extradition agreement with Hong Kong. In retaliation, China suspended its extradition agreement with Australia. Beijing also suspended its extradition agreements with the United Kingdom and Canada, which had suspended their extradition agreements with Hong Kong in response to the national security law. New Zealand On 9 July, New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced that New Zealand would review \\"the setting of its relationship\\" with Hong Kong in response to the introduction of the national security law. On 28 July, New Zealand suspended its extradition treaty with Hong Kong on the grounds that it \\"eroded rule-of-law principles\\" and undermined the \\"one country, two systems\\" rule. In retaliation, China severed its extradition agreement with New Zealand on 3 August. Japan In Japan, Gen Nakatani, of the Liberal Democratic Party, and Shiori Yamao set up a nonpartisan group, on July 29, with the aim of easing visa requirements for any Hong Kong citizens leaving the city due to the National Security Law, and making it easier for Hong Kongers to work and immigrate to Japan. It also urges the Japanese Government to not extradite any potential offenders of the National Security Law. Under the provisions of the Extradition Act, the general framework for extradition by Japanese Law, political prisoners cannot be extradited to foreign countries, and offenders of the National Security Law are considered to fall under such status. United States United States President Donald J. Trump declared that the administrative principle of One country, Two systems, which acted to guide Hong Kong policy as separate from Mainland China, was no longer in affect, and issued Executive Order 13936, which terminated Hong Kong's special trade status with the United States. US Congress passed the Hong Kong Autonomy Act, which issued sanctions on several Hong Kong officials deemed responsible for undermining the autonomy of Hong Kong, via the National Security Law. Citing human rights concerns, it cancelled its extradition treaty and suspended cooperation on training police and military. =Companies= On 3 June, the banks HSBC and Standard Chartered gave their backing to the law. HSBC made a post stating the company \\"respects and supports all laws that stabilise Hong Kong‚Äôs social order\\". Standard Chartered stated they believe the law can \\"help maintain the long term economic and social stability of Hong Kong\\". In response, British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab criticised HSBC's statements, saying \\"ultimately businesses will make their own judgement calls, but let me just put it this way, we will not sacrifice the people of Hong Kong over the altar of banker bonuses\\". =Political analysis of British and international responses= Boris Johnson's stance on Hong Kong is considered firm. Hong Kong Free Press notes that Johnson was once an editor for The Spectator, a British politics magazine that \\"has for decades campaigned in favour of standing up for Hong Kong and making its citizens British\\". Johnson had previously voiced support for Hong Kong autonomy against the proposed extradition bill that incited the protests in 2019. Johnson is seen as taking a more forceful approach to Hong Kong autonomy than former Prime Minister David Cameron; The Guardian's diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour wrote on 3 June 2020 that Cameron had been scared of the public perception of an influx of Hong Kong nationals to the UK in 2015 (when he encouraged China to allow Hong Kong to elect its leader without Beijing interference but went no further), while Johnson's hard stance to allow such mass migration is seen as a risk worth taking because it would also fundamentally undermine China's economy. Wintour and Guardian journalist Helen Davidson suggested that the ambiguity and possible conflicting statements on the number of Hong Kong residents the BNO measures will be extended to could reflect several things. One reason may be differences in opinion within the Cabinet, but Wintour and Davidson also write that it may be a tactic \\"to leave China guessing about the potential scale of a British- enabled brain drain from Hong Kong, if Beijing seeks to suppress human rights in the territory\\". The director of Hong Kong Watch, a human rights NGO, Johnny Patterson, felt that Johnson's announcement was \\"a watershed moment in Sino- British relations [because] no sitting PM has made a statement as bold as this on Hong Kong since the handover\\". Patterson added that it shows \\"the severity of the situation on the ground [and] the fact that the British government genuinely, and rightly, feel a sense of duty to citizens of Hong Kong and are going to do all they can to stop them becoming the collateral damage of escalating geopolitical tensions\\". Davidson and Guardian Australia journalist Daniel Hurst note that despite powerful political calls in the country, and a precedent of good relations with Hong Kong and helping evacuate Chinese people in times of emergency, Morrison had a detached approach to the issue of welcoming fleeing Hong Kongers. They said Australia was \\"issuing statements of concern jointly with likeminded countries including the US, the UK and Canada, rather than speaking out on its own\\", and said this was because Australia had recently strained its relations with China when it was early to call for an inquiry related to the spread of COVID-19. Japan, which signed a statement with the G7 condemning China in relation to imposition of the law on 17 June, is typically neutral to Chinese politics. Wintour suggested that Japan decided to add their voice to the international dissent because of \\"a growing Japanese perception of the technological threat to Japanese security posed by China\\". Shinzo Abe said that he wanted Japan to take the lead on the G7's statement, an announcement that drew criticism from China. In the wake of the new security law implemented in Hong Kong by China, the United Kingdom suspended its extradition treaty with Hong Kong on 20 July, 2020. The UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab suggested that the revocation of extradition treaty will prevent its misuse. On October 14, 2020, the United States Department of State released a report on 10 individuals who materially contribute to the failure of the China to meet its obligations under the Sino‚ÄìBritish Joint Declaration and Hong Kong's Basic Law. Xia Baolong, Zhang Xiaoming, Luo Huining, Carrie Lam, Teresa Cheng, Erick Tsang, Zheng Yanxiong, Eric Chan, John Lee, Chris Tang were on the list. LegislationInitial plans= Chinese plans for the legislation included most prominently criminalising \\"separatism, subversion, terrorism and foreign interference\\", which many interpreted as a crackdown on civil liberties, government critics, and the independence movement. China also planned to implement an intelligence service in Hong Kong under the law, using the PRC's own Ministry of Public Security police force that previously had no power or influence in Hong Kong. Various national governments expressed concern that the Chinese plans would undermine Hong Kong autonomy and the \\"one country, two systems\\" policy. The NPC approved the Chinese plans on 29 May 2020, with state media outlet People's Daily declaring that the approval \\"sends a strong signal [...] to anti-China forces in Hong Kong desperately fighting like a cornered wild beast: your defeat has already been decided\\". After gatherings marking the one-year anniversary of the extradition law protest movement on 8 June 2020, Zhang Xiaoming, deputy director of China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office who had been demoted from the director position in February 2020, said that the national security law would only give Hong Kong residents more freedom, saying: \\"They can be free from the fear of violence. They can ride the train and go shopping freely. They can speak the truth on the street without the fear of being beaten up. In particular, they no longer have to worry about young people being brainwashed.\\" Carrie Lam refused to rule out that the law could be applied retroactively. The Global Times, controlled by the People's Daily, suggested that past tweets from the pro-democracy Hong Kong businessman Jimmy Lai may be used as evidence to prosecute Lai under the law. Former Chief Executive CY Leung also suspected it may be used to ban Tiananmen Square vigils. On 10 June 2020, Hong Kong police began \\"establishing dedicated unit to enforce the new law\\", which had not been formally announced at that point; the next day, the British government revealed that an outline of the Chinese legislation \\"includes provision for the authorities in Hong Kong to report back to Beijing on progress in pursuing national security education of its people\\". While Hong Kong's public universities publicly supported the law and said it will not affect academia and research, scientists in the territory feared that China's censorship of COVID-19 research publication would be extended to Hong Kong under the law. They also expressed concern that Hong Kong will likely be stripped of international funding within academia. A further worry within the field was the growth of self-censorship as a defensive response to fear of being punished for \\"publishing research that could upset the central government\\", citing unsuccessful trials as something that could harm market prospects, making scientists fear continuing to work at all. One dean, speaking to Nature in June 2020, insisted the law would not affect publishing, but did acknowledge that access to US data would become restricted. On 15 June 2020, the 30th anniversary of the Basic Law being officially enacted, Beijing announced that the Chinese government reserves the right to deal with cases under the national security law, expecting the number to be low and in \\"very special circumstances\\", and that a mainland security office must be opened in Hong Kong as a demand of the government. The government refused to qualify what the exceptional circumstances may be, leading to fears that the law will be used to arrest critics of Beijing and then have them extradited to the mainland for prosecution. As well as the new mainland security office, Hong Kong must allow Chinese security agencies to operate in the region when needed, and accept that Chinese agencies \\"will supervise and guide the Hong Kong government\\". Controversy had already erupted the day before, after police arrested a teenage schoolgirl for protesting by using a knee to pin her neck to the ground, with another officer pinning her at the waist. This drew comparisons to the killing of George Floyd and prompted questions about the use of force on a non-violent minor. The first concrete details of the legislation were announced on 15 June 2020, but by the time lawmakers in Beijing were approving final drafts on 29 June 2020, Carrie Lam had still not seen a draft of the law. =Provisions= Hong Kong National Security Law (English translation ‚Äì pdf) The NPCSC passed the law unanimously on 30 June 2020 and listed it under Annex III of the Basic Law, bypassing Hong Kong approval. According to media reports, the final law would criminalise secession of Hong Kong, subversion against the Chinese government, terrorism, and colluding with foreign forces. The law is broader than China's own criminal law. The law came into effect at 2300 local time (1500 UTC) on 30 June and the full text of the law was only published at the time it became effective. BBC noted the significance of the law coming into effect just before the 23rd anniversary of the 1 July 1997 handover, an event that annually draws large pro-democracy protests. Despite this, political leader Wu Chi-wai (of the Hong Kong Democratic Party) said that he will still attend a march on 1 July. Al Jazeera's Katrina Yu said \\"It's very symbolic that this law has been passed just a day before the anniversary of Hong Kong's handover from Britain back to mainland China\\", saying it was a power play by China. The law applies to Hong Kong permanent residents as well as non-residents, and those outside Hong Kong who violate the law. It has six chapters and a total of 66 articles, published in the Hong Kong Government Gazette solely in Chinese. These cover the four crimes (secession, subversion, terrorism, collusion), which are all punishable with a maximum sentence of life in prison. The minimum sentence for \\"active participants\\" is set at 3 years, and under 3 years of detention or restriction for other participants or those that voluntarily surrender. The areas of treason, sedition and theft of state secrets are not covered by the new law, and remain to be implemented by the Hong Kong legislature. China announced that they will administer the law, and that it can also be used to prosecute people from other countries. Reviews of the content proved troubling to legal scholars and observers, as it is deemed to be \\"stronger than many feared, both in scope and penalties\\". While not carrying life sentences, peaceful protesters could see 10 years in prison if it is judged the protest movement has foreign links, and freedoms will be limited as all \\"foreign groups, organisations and media\\" will be subject to oversight from the Chinese government. Chinese intelligence agencies will be present in Hong Kong, and have powers that go above all Hong Kong laws, with Chinese agents in Hong Kong having immunity from criminal liability. Any decisions made by the new Chinese national security commission will also be immune from facing legal challenge. Still, Reuters positively noted that the law explains it cannot be retroactively applied to actions that occurred before it was implemented. Other specific offences are laid out in the law, such as the damage of transport facilities being considered a terrorism offence. Article 29 of the law criminalises \\"inciting hatred of the central government and Hong Kong's regional government\\". This also seems to cover written works: on 5 July, at least nine books about democracy were made unavailable in Hong Kong as they were removed or reviewed for violating the law. Article 38 details how foreign nationals committing acts outside of Hong Kong and China are criminally liable under the law, and that such foreigners could be arrested upon arrival in Hong Kong. Anyone found guilty under the law will be barred from public office for life. In respect to China taking control and extraditing suspects, Al Jazeera reported that: \\"The full text of the law gave three scenarios when China might take over a prosecution: complicated foreign interference cases, 'very serious' cases and when national security faces 'serious and realistic threats'.\\" The law further explains that the action does not need to be violent, and that the minimum sentence in such cases will be 10 years. Emily Feng wrote for NPR that, because of this power, China was effectively installing \\"an extreme version\\" of the failed 2019 Hong Kong extradition bill. As part of the Chinese security presence in Hong Kong, the law provides for the establishment of the Office for Safeguarding National Security of the CPG in the HKSAR, a bureau exempt from Hong Kong jurisdiction that can, if the Central People's Government of the PRC chooses to grant it jurisdiction, prosecute cases under the Criminal Procedure Law of the People's Republic of China. On 3 July 2020, Zheng Yanxiong was appointed head of the bureau. Zheng is considered to have strong nationalist views on national security, including a dislike for media. On 6 July 2020 the Hong Kong government published the Implementation Rules for Article 43. The rules enable Hong Kong police officers to conduct searches at private properties without a warrant, restrict suspects' movements, freeze their assets and intercept communications. The police can also require publishers, hosting providers and internet service providers to remove, or block or restrict access to, content that the police think is likely to constitute an offence under the national security law. If the providers do not co-operate immediately the police can seize equipment and remove the content themselves. People prosecuted under the law will face different judges to the Hong Kong judiciary; BBC China correspondent Stephen McDonell wrote on 30 June that Hong Kong's judges are independent and can appropriately interpret the law, which the Chinese government will not accept, and so judges will be appointed for this matter by the Chief Executive directly. McDonell writes that this is \\"effectively installed by Beijing\\". This brought into question the role of Commonwealth of Nations, including many British, justices that hear cases in Hong Kong, though Chief Justice of Hong Kong Geoffrey Ma spoke up on 2 July to say that judges will be chosen by merit rather than political affiliation, and foreign judges will be permitted. Some cases in Hong Kong can be held without juries if it is deemed they contain state secrets; similarly, the press and public will not be allowed to observe some court proceedings for some cases. The Guardian pointed out that closed-door trials are often used in mainland China in cases involving political dissidents. The law does not presume bail will be granted for those arrested under it, and there is no limit to how long these people may be held. International reactions On 1 July 2020, the day after implementation of the security law, tens of thousands of Hong Kong people gathered on the streets in Causeway Bay to march. On 2 July, the Hong Kong government declared the 'Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time' slogan depicted on a banner here ‚Äì \\"the most resonant slogan of its protest movement\\" ‚Äì to be subversive and in violation of the law. More countries and groups responded after the law was enacted on 30 June 2020. The UK, the President of the European Council, and NATO responded with statements that China was destroying the rule of law in Hong Kong, and the UK, Taiwan and Canada warned their citizens against visiting Hong Kong. Presidents Ursula von der Leyen of the European Commission and Charles Michel of the European Council announced that they would discuss within Europe whether to discredit China as a trading partner. Speaking in the UK House of Commons, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab announced that the British National Overseas offer still stands, and saying that the UK may take further action if the full text of the law shows further breaches of the Joint Declaration. Germany also called for the postponed European Union-China summit to be rescheduled as soon as possible, while Japan spoke forcefully against China. France began more fervently reaching out to national leaders to create an international \\"anti-Chinese alliance\\". A 30 June meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Council saw a majority of countries express support for the law. The British ambassador to the UN presented a statement on behalf of 27 other countries to the UN, criticising the law. The Cuban ambassador responded with a statement on behalf of 52 other countries, 50 of which are listed as either unfree or partly free by Freedom in the World, in support of the law, stating that \\"Hong Kong affairs are China's internal affairs that brook no interference by foreign forces.\\" The statement criticised the discussion of the law in the UNHRC itself, reasoning that \\"non- interference in internal affairs of sovereign states is an essential principle enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and a basic norm of international relations.\\" Support and opposition to the law at the UNHRC on 30 June 2020 Tom Cheshire, Sky News's Asia correspondent, wrote on 30 June 2020 that the law and its strength was evidence that the Chinese government does not care what the world thinks of its behaviour, that Xi Jinping could not wait until 2047 to take over Hong Kong, and that the timing suggests China felt the distraction of the COVID-19 pandemic on the rest of the world made it an easier moment to impose the law. The same view was expressed by the BBC's diplomatic correspondent on 2 July, who wrote that \\"the Covid-19 crisis gave Beijing the opportunity to bring the Hong Kong crisis to a head\\", while CNN expressed that the pandemic as well as \\"the antics of the Trump administration\\" were used as distraction, noting that the situation of world politics at the time was \\"discombobulated\\". Both political parties in the US created bills to provide refugee status for Hong Kong residents, for those \\"at risk of persecution\\" because of the law, and a bill passed in the House of Representatives on 2 July to sanction US banks that deal with China. Titled the Hong Kong Autonomy Act, it will now pass to the US president. British journalist Simon Jenkins wrote an opinion piece on the law and its response, expressing pride at the democracy still shown in Hong Kong but also affirming that even these local democracy activists have long felt Hong Kong would end up a Chinese enclave. Jenkins suggested the law was damaging and inevitable, and the only appropriate response is to help the Hong Kongers who believe in democracy to leave. On 3 July, Canada announced that it would stop extraditing people to Hong Kong, stop exporting certain goods including weapons to the Region, and would consider introducing new Hong Kong immigration measures, and Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council issued a formal warning which advised Taiwanese citizens against visiting China, Hong Kong, or Macao in light of the new security law so that they do not become a \\"second Lee Ming-che\\". On 9 July, Australia matched Canada in retracting its extradition deal, and matched the UK by establishing a path to permanent residency for Hong Kongers. After being granted asylum by the UK, Simon Cheng suggested that he and other Hong Kong democracy activists may start a Hong Kong parliament-in-exile that would reflect the real and free views of the people of Hong Kong. Critics say the law marks Beijing's full takeover of Hong Kong, which was promised 50 years of a \\"high degree of autonomy\\" after the handover. Alvin Cheung, a legal scholar focusing on Hong Kong issues at New York University's US-Asia Law Institute, opined: \\"A national security law was imposed on Hong Kong through a process nobody in Hong Kong had any control over, with content nobody in Hong Kong was privy to. That should put an end to the notion that Hong Kong remains autonomous in any meaningful way\\". Rights advocates and legal scholars believe the law will be used broadly to stifle dissent. Joshua Rosenzweig, the head of Amnesty International's China Team, said, \\"The passing of the national security law is a painful moment for the people of Hong Kong and represents the greatest threat to human rights in the city's recent history. From now on, China will have the power to impose its own laws on any criminal suspect it chooses\\". CNN also expressed concern for the freedom of speech of foreign media, as several companies ‚Äì including itself, Bloomberg, and the Agence France-Presse ‚Äì have their Asian headquarters in Hong Kong. = Article 38 controversy = Concerns have been raised that Article 38 of the law exerts extraterritorial jurisdiction over all non-Chinese citizens, which some consider to be criminalising any criticism of the CCP or Chinese government by anyone anywhere in the world. The introduction of the law, and particularly Article 38, caused individuals and international organizations to scramble to adapt to China‚Äôs increasing extraterritorial reach. A number of organizations closed down entirely and the exodus of refugees from Hong Kong has increased. Taiwanese outlets reported that a Hong Kong legal scholar, Eric Cheung, sarcastically said \\"there are 8 billion people who will have to read the national security law\\" so that they do not break it, and asserted that they have the legal right to enforce it on anyone. A US-based China correspondent for the media outlet Axios, Bethany Allen-Ebrahimian, suggested that the inclusion of Article 38 was primarily targeting the Hong Kong diaspora and aiming to prevent dissident organisation within Hong Konger communities abroad.  Enforcement  On 1 July 2020, many protesters took to the streets despite the official 1 July march being banned by the police. Ten people were arrested for breaking the new law. Police have been taking DNA samples of suspects arrested on a suspicion of breaking the NSL. On 29 July, 19-year-old Tony Chung and three other former members of \\"Studentlocalism\\" was arrested on suspicion of inciting secession, becoming the first political figures to be so arrested under the national security law. Chung said the men who abducted him took him to a shopping centre where his telephone was forcibly unlocked, and then went to search his home in Yuen Long. The three were later released on bail. On 10 August, Apple Daily founder Jimmy Lai was arrested under the \\"collusion with foreign powers\\" charge, alongside six others associated with his enterprise Next Media. Over 200 police forces raided the Next Media headquarters in Tseung Kwan O. On the same day, activists Agnes Chow, Andy Li, and Wilson Li were also arrested on various national security charges. The raid on Apple Daily triggered mass outpouring of support for the newspaper, with share prices of Next Media soaring by 300% as supporters of the newspaper bought up shares of the company to show their support. Other independent local media companies that have reported on government misconduct over the past year, such as TVMost and i-Cable Communications, also saw significant share price rises as citizens flocked to invest in media companies to express their support for the freedom of the press. Teachers have been investigated for being overly critical of the police, and some courses that might violate the new law have been cancelled. Opposition legislators fear if they vote in a way not aligned with the Beijing government, they may be prosecuted.Beijing Attempts To Remake Hong Kong In Its Image As National Security Law Takes Hold = International warrants = According to Chinese state media, the Hong Kong police issued arrest warrants for six activists outside of Hong Kong citing suspected violations of the law. These are Nathan Law, who left Hong Kong prior to the NSL coming into effect; Simon Cheng, a former employee by the British consulate in Hong Kong who was detained by the PSB and allegedly tortured, and who was granted asylum in the United Kingdom; Ray Wong, who skipped bail and was granted asylum in Germany in May 2018; and pro- independence activists Wayne Chan and Honcques Laus. Also on the wanted list is Samuel Chu, son of Reverend Chu Yiu-ming, a naturalised American citizen who runs the Hong Kong Democracy Council in Washington. He reacted by ridiculing Hong Kong police for targeting a US citizen of 25 years for lobbying his own government, warning that although the first, he would not be the last non-Chinese citizen to be intimidated in this way.

He took over the management of Wilhelm Karmann GmbH based in Osnabr√ºck in 1952 and led the company to become a recognized partner of the automotive industry as a contract manufacturer of complete vehicles and as a supplier of pressed parts, production systems and roof modules for convertibles. He was also involved in numerous vehicle developments. Wilhelm Karmann Jr. (1989) It was the VW Karmann-Ghia that made the name Karmann known worldwide. In 1955, Karmann presented the coup√© version of the VW 1200, designed by Luigi Segre, the owner of the Italian Ghia bodywork plant in Turin, to the General Director of the Volkswagen plant, Heinrich Nordhoff. Volkswagen liked the soft lines of the coup√© and this was the beginning of the worldwide success story of the Karmann-Ghia. The love for open cars accompanied Karmann throughout his life; not only the VW Beetle and then the Golf Cabriolet came from Osnabr√ºck, but also convertibles from Audi, Ford and Mercedes as well as a variety of roof systems as component deliveries. A total of around 3 million vehicles rolled off the assembly lines under Karmann's management; not only convertibles and coupes, but also other vehicles produced in small series. In 1990, Karmann handed over the management of the company to younger hands, but accompanied and steered the company until his death in 1998 in his role as chairman of the shareholders' meeting and honorary chairman of the supervisory board of Wilhelm Karmann GmbH.  Early life and education  Wilhelm Karmann was born in Krefeld, the son and third of the five children of Wilhelm Karmann Sr., who had taken over the respected Osnabr√ºck wagon manufacturing company from Christian Klages on 1 August 1901. Karmann Sr. soon made a name for himself in the still young automotive industry through innovative measures, such as the transition from wooden to semi-steel and then to all-steel bodywork. He also introduced the quick-drying nitro spray paint in 1925. Both were prerequisites for the series production of cars. He also equipped his plant with large presses and began manufacturing his own press tools. In the 1930s, Karmann sr. thus became a pioneer in the German mass production of convertibles and limousines for customers such as the Adler factories in Frankfurt/Main or Hanomag in Hanover.  Personal life  In 1947, during a visit to the island of Borkum, Karmann met Christiane Kemper from Minden, who was on holiday with her brothers on the North Sea island. The Karmann couple married on 24 May 1949 and had three children, Wilhelm-Dietrich (born 1951), Christiane (born 1952) and Stephanie (born 1957). Karmann was the holder of numerous orders and decorations * On 29 April 1977, the Federal Republic of Germany awarded him the Grand Cross of Merit of the Order of Merit * On 10 September 1984 Karmann was awarded the Grand Cross of Merit of the Order of Merit of Lower Saxony. * On 2 January 1985 the city of Osnabr√ºck awarded him the Justus M√∂ser Medal. * On 17 December 1993 Karmann was appointed honorary senator at the University of Osnabr√ºck. Karmann died on 25 October 1998, in Osnabr√ºck. On the occasion of the 100th birthday of the company founder, Karmann and his co-partners established the Wilhelm Karmann Foundation on 14 February 1971 with initial capital of one million DM. The foundation supported projects at the Museum of Cultural History, the Osnabr√ºck Zoo Society, the Museum of Industrial Culture, the Osnabr√ºck University of Applied Sciences and the University of Osnabr√ºck. https://sundoc.bibliothek.uni-halle.de/diss-online/02/02H210/t4.pdf The amount of the foundation increased continuously and amounted to about 3.9 million Euro in 2019. Karmann held honorary positions in numerous professional organisations and business associations. For example, he was Vice-President of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce Osnabr√ºck-Emsland for many years, and also Vice-President of the regional Industrial Employers' Association. He was also involved in the Osnabr√ºck Industrial Club, which was founded by his father and which sees itself as a mediator between industry, politics and society and also serves to promote the exchange of common interests within the Osnabr√ºck business community. Karmann was very interested in the well-being of his employees. All too often, he helped families in socially precarious situations with material resources and money, true to the motto that quick help is double help. Life Wilhelm Karmann Jr. joined the company at the age of 19. After an orientation phase, he started an apprenticeship at a Southern German car body company and at Deutsche Fiat. From 1935 to 1937, he studied at the Berlin Technical School for Car Body and Vehicle Construction. Following his exams, he worked as a design engineer in the production- engineering department of Ambi-Budd. At the age of 25, he returned to Osnabr√ºck to work for his own company. In 1941 he was drafted as a soldier, served in Russia, the Netherlands and Italy and only returned from American captivity in Naples in 1945. After World War II, Karmann and his father rebuilt the Karmann factory. When his father died of pneumonia on 28 September 1952, Karmann Jr. assumed overall responsibility.  Reconstruction and partnership with Volkswagen  In 1945, Karmann and his father set about resuming operations with the remaining production resources. For the British Army, for example, more than 100,000 forks and spoons were produced, and Karmann produced 10,000 tin tubs for wheelbarrows for the Harburg Tempo works. More important, however, was cooperation with the Ford Company, with whom Karmann had already worked well before the war. Karmann bundled the remaining stocks of tools still available in East Berlin, restored and modernized them in Osnabr√ºck and delivered them to Cologne. Ford was very satisfied with how Karmann had repaired the tools and commissioned the Osnabr√ºck Company to supply 2,000 sets of pressed parts. This was followed by the first major order. Now Karmann was to supply 800 platform bodies for Ford trucks. And in spring 1946, Karmann was commissioned to produce 1,000 cabs for the Hanomag road tractor. Karmann and his father sought to build car bodies again. Their company cooperated with the new Auto Union GmbH, on whose order the first prototypes of the all-steel sedan and the 4-seater convertible were delivered from August 1949 on. This order was followed by the production of over 1,000 series vehicles for Auto Union. VW Beetle Convertible At the beginning of 1948, Karmann succeeded in purchasing a Volkswagen saloon, the VW Type 1,which he transformed into a convertible with the help of his father. Together they presented the convertible in Wolfsburg to Heinrich Nordhoff, who had been General Director of Volkswagen Company since 1 January 1948. In May 1949, Karmann delivered 25 Volkswagen Cabriolets to the VW test department. And on 1 August 1949, the time had come: Volkswagen ordered \\"1,000 four-seater, four- winged Type 15 Cabriolets\\" from Karmann at a unit price per bodywork of Deutsche Mark 1,900 net ex works. The foundation stone for a lasting partnership with Volkswagen was laid. At that time Karmann employed 642 people; after the death of the company founder and the takeover of the business, the workforce had already grown to over 1,400. In addition to vehicle construction and the press shop, Karmann committed to the further development of tool making. The production of complicated large tools, with which body parts such as mudguards, roofs or doors were formed from the steel sheets, cost a lot of money and also led to controversial discussions with his father. But Karmann's strategy worked. At the beginning of the 60s, there were only a few car models in Europe for which Karmann had not supplied pressing tools or pressed parts.  Creation of the Karmann-Ghia  One year after taking over his father's bodywork company in Osnabr√ºck, Karmann devised what would become the Karmann-Ghia. Karmann wanted to produce a sporty and open two-seater based on the VW Beetle. Volkswagen, too, was interested in a sporty roadster that would be loved by American soldiers stationed in Europe and would be taken to the USA. Luigi Segre, the owner of Carrozzeria Ghia in Turin, was included in the plan at the Geneva Motor Show. He got a chassis of a Beetle from Osnabr√ºck and put a self-designed body on the chassis. To Karmann's amazement, Luigi Segre then presented him with not a roadster but a coup√© that could also be turned into a roadster at the Paris Motor Show. At an appointment arranged at short notice in Osnabr√ºck on 16 November 1953, VW boss Heinrich Nordhoff liked the coup√© with its flowing lines and rounded forms so much that he commissioned the construction of the car on the same day. VW Karmann-Ghia Despite many suggestions, neither Wolfsburg nor Osnabr√ºck had a brilliant idea for what the car would be named. Karmann came up with its name, the Karmann-Ghia. Volkswagen was able to adorn itself with the world-famous name Ghia, and for the bodywork plant in Turin, too, this name was the best reference to Italian design. Throughout the long history of the company the car has carried the name Karmann around the world. On 14 July 1955, Karmann presented the new coup√© from Volkswagen in the Casino Hotel of Georgsmarienh√ºtte, the neighbouring city of Osnabr√ºck. In the first year of production alone, a total of 10,000 coup√©s were delivered instead of the planned 3,000 units. Johannes Beeskow, who headed technical development from 1956 to 1976, carried out further work on this and many other vehicles at Karmann. The VW Karmann-Ghia became a sales success with more than 362,000 units, even though the performance of the car with only 30 hp and a top speed of 115 km/h did not match the sporty appearance. The Karmann-Ghia convertible followed in 1957 and in 1961 the larger Type 34, the VW Karmann-Ghia Type 34, whose design also came from the Carrozzeria Ghia. VW Golf Cabriolet and VW Karmann Ghia were built by Karmann With the Karmann-Ghia, but also with the Beetle Cabriolet, Wilhelm Karmann helped to make the salesrooms of Volkswagen dealers more attractive and appealing. Although both vehicle types were niche products, their appeal led to a boost in sales of the VW Beetle as a mass product. In terms of numbers produced at Karmann, the Karmann-Ghia Coup√©s and Cabriolets were later slightly surpassed by both the VW Golf Cabriolet and the VW Scirocco I. If on the other hand, the first Karmann-Ghia types were added together via Coup√© and Cabrio, the Karmann-Ghia was Karmann's most successful vehicle.  Years of growth  In addition to the Beetle Cabriolet and the Karmann Ghia, Karmann also produced all the Golf cabriolets and the VW Scirocco and VW Corrado sports coup√©s for Volkswagen. Karmann built further vehicle plants, in 1960 in S√£o Bernardo do Campo (Brazil) and in 1965 in Rheine. From 1965 onwards, Karmann produced complete vehicles and bodies of the BMW Coup√© 2000 C/CS (four-cylinder), later also the larger BMW E9 six- cylinder coup√©s (2.5 CS, 2.8 CS, 3.0 CS/CSi) at the Rheine plant in Westphalia. From 1976 to the 1980s, Karmann first took over the series production and then the body shell of the BMW 6-series coup√© (628 CSi, 633CSi, 635 CSi). All convertible models of the Ford Escort were delivered in Rheine as complete vehicles. VW Golf Cabriolet Karmann also produced motorhomes under the name Karmann-Mobil from 1977 onwards. Karmann got the idea for his first motorhome during a trip in South Africa. The first vehicles were built on the basis of a Volkswagen T2, followed by the T3 and LT as well as the Mercedes- Benz T1. Parallel to this, the Postilion 4500 and 5000 caravan models were developed and built in Brazil and launched on the market in 1982. This was followed by many other motorhomes with the type designations Gipsy, Davis and Distance. A special highlight in Karmann's life was the production anniversary with the Volkswagen plant. On 23 June 1981 the 1.5 millionth car with the Volkswagen emblem produced in Osnabr√ºck left the assembly lines. It was a white Scirocco GTI. Ford Escort Cabriolet Karmann was chairman of the Board of Management until his 75th birthday in 1989. That year marked a number of anniversaries. Karmann Rheine had existed for 25 years. The Golf Cabriolet was 10 years old and Karmann could not only look back on 40 years of cooperation with Volkswagen, but also celebrate his company‚Äôs 50th year in operation. His successor to the board of management was Rainer Thieme, who previously managed Keiper Recaro, a company that produced seats for the automotive and aircraft industries. After retiring from operational management, Karmann continued to steer the company in his roles as chairman of the shareholders' meeting and as liable general partner of the holding company Wilhelm Karmann KG. When Karmann took over the company in 1952, 1,415 employees generated a turnover of 24 million DM. In 1998, the year of his death, the turnover of the group of companies with about 7,000 employees had increased to over 1.1 billion DM.

She did not race until the autumn of her three-year-old season when she won a minor race on her debut and then finished second in the Severals Stakes. In the following year she showed top-class form to win the Middleton Stakes and Prix de l'Op√©ra as well as being placed in the Pretty Polly Stakes and Nassau Stakes. As a broodmare she produced Izzi Top and Jazzi Top (winner of the Prix de la Nonette). Background Zee Zee Top is a dark bay mare with no white markings bred in England by the Hampshire-based Meon Valley Stud She was sent into training with Michael Stoute at Newmarket, Suffolk. She was sired by Zafonic, the best European two-year-old of 1992 who went on to win the 2000 Guineas in the following year. The best of Zafonic's other offspring included Xaar, and Zafeen. Her dam Colorspin won the Irish Oaks in 1986 and went on to become an outstanding broodmare whose other foals included Opera House and Kayf Tara. Racing career2002: three-year-old season= On 7 October 2002 at Pontefract Racecourse, Zee Zee Top made her track debut in a maiden race over one mile on firm ground and started the 4/6 favourite in a six-runner field. Ridden by Kieren Fallon she took the lead approaching the final furlong and quickly drew away from her opponents to win by seven lengths. Fallon was again in the saddle ten days later when the filly was stepped up in class for the Listed Severals Stakes on softer ground at Newmarket Racecourse and was matched against older fillies and mares. Starting at 12/1 she was restrained in the early stages before making steady progress to take second place, two lengths behind the four-year-old Salim Toto. =2003: four-year-old season= Zee Zee Top began her second campaign in the Listed Middleton Stakes over ten furlongs at York Racecourse on 14 May and started the 11/10 favourite against five opponents including Chorist and Golden Silca (second in the Irish 1,000 Guineas and Coronation Stakes). After settling behind the leaders she was sent into the lead by Fallon at half way and kept on well to win by a length from Chorist, from whom she was receiving three pounds in weight. Brett Doyle took the ride when Zee Zee Top was sent to Ireland and started favourite for the Group 2 Pretty Polly Stakes at the Curragh on 28 June. She was beaten a neck into second place by the three-year- old Hanami but was relegated one place for hampering the third-placed finisher Snippets as she switched left to obtain a clear run inside the last quarter mile. She was then stepped up to the highest class for the Group 1 Nassau Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse on 2 August in which she was ridden by Johnny Murtagh and came home third behind Russian Rhythm and the French filly Ana Marie. Later that month she was tried over one and a half miles in the Yorkshire Oaks but never looked likely to win and finished sixth of the eight runners behind Islington, beaten six and a half lengths by the winner. Fallon and Zee Zee Top were reunited when the filly was sent to France and went off a 14/1 outsider for the Prix de l'Op√©ra over 2000 metres on holding ground at Longchamp Racecourse on 5 October. Bright Sky started favourite, while the other nine runners included Yesterday, Ana Marie, Next Gina (Preis der Diana), Trumbaka (Prix Corrida), Sweet Folly (Prix Cl√©op√¢tre) and Comercante (Prix de Psych√©). Zee Zee Top raced towards the rear and turned into the straight in tenth place before launching a strong late run in the last 300 metres. She took the lead in the final strides and prevailed in a \\"blanket finish\\", beating Yesterday by a head, with Bright Sky and Trumbaka a neck and a head away in third and fourth. Breeding record At the end of her racing career Zee Zee Top was retired to become a broodmare for the Meon Valley Sud. She produced at least eleven foals and four winners: *Zee Zee Gee, a bay filly, foaled in 2005, sired by Galileo. Unraced. *Green Top, bay filly, 2006, by Green Desert.

The Council's CEO is Colin Jensen, supported by EO Ainsley Gold.  Strategy  Brisbane City Council is guided by two core future planning documents: Brisbane's Future Blueprint (infrastructure, cultural, and capital works projects), and Brisbane Vision 2031 (corporate and city planning). Council also does more frequent but smaller scale community consultations through the Your City Your Say platform. = Brisbane Future Blueprint = Brisbane's Future Blueprint is a community-developed document, released in June 2018, outlining what the City Council's goals should be. One in five households in Brisbane, representing every suburb, responded to the community consultation, totalling over 100,000 responses. More than 15,000 unique suggestions to improve Brisbane were put forward. The Blueprint provides for eight principles and 40 specific actions to make Brisbane a \\"friendly and liveable city\\": # Create a city of neighbourhoods # Protect and create greenspace # Create more to see and do # Protect the Brisbane backyard and our unique character # Ensure best practice design that complements the character of Brisbane # Empower and engage residents # Get people home quicker and safer with more travel options # Give people more choice when it comes to housing = Brisbane Vision 2031 = Brisbane Vision 2031 is the City Council's long- term plan for developing Brisbane City.

It is composed of the Chairs of Council's seven other standing committees: * City Planning and Economic Development Committee (Krista Adams - Deputy Mayor of Brisbane) * Finance, Administration and Small Business Committee (Adam Allen) * Environment, Parks and Sustainability Committee (Fiona Cummingham) * Community, Arts and Nighttime Economy Committee (Vicki Howard) * City Standards, Community Health and Safety Committee (Kim Marx) * Infrastructure Committee (David MacLachlan) * Public and Active Transport Committee (Ryan Murphy) Generally, the Lord Mayor is also the Chair of the Establishment and Coordination Committee, and as a result, is the Chair and member of the Civic Cabinet as well. Each Committee works alongside its relevant organisational divisions to \\"consider Council policy, provide advice to Council and delivers results for the people of Brisbane.\\" = Organisational divisions = Within BCC, there are six different organisational divisions representing the core tasks of the Council. Each division had its own Divisional Manager, who is accountable to the Council of Brisbane, the Civil Cabinet, and the CEO/EO.

Since arriving in the UK, he has worked in TV and film production, and has also worked doing marketing for a refugee charity. Akkad filmed his journey to the UK, and this footage was used in the BBC documentary, Exodus: Our Journey to Europe which won the BAFTA award for Best Factual Series or Strand in 2017. Akkad raised the issue of how many refugees had died trying to enter Europe when invited to join director James Bluemel at his acceptance speech. In July 2020, he worked with Marc Quinn in creating and installing the statue A Surge of Power (Jen Reid) 2020 to replace the one of Edward Colston in Bristol. =Coronavirus= Following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, he started working as a cleaner for the NHS at Whipps Cross Hospital in East London. While working in the hospital, he took photos of his colleagues, which were published on the Politico website. Akkad stated that \\"everyone [he worked with] felt completely betrayed, [and] stabbed in the back\\" in response to the government announcing that NHS cleaners and porters wouldn't be included in an NHS bereavement scheme if they die due to coronavirus, and that immigrant NHS workers would still have to pay a ¬£400 immigration health surcharge. In response, he filmed a message to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, which he published on Twitter, explaining that he was \\"shocked to find out that your Government decided to exclude myself and my colleagues who work as cleaners and porters and social care workers [from the scheme] ... so if I die from coronavirus my partner isn‚Äôt allowed indefinite leave to remain\\". Following this video, the government made a U-turn, and included these workers in the bereavement scheme. The Observer argued that this video was \\"directly instrumental in another of the prime minister‚Äôs mumbled U-turns the following day\\", and British Vogue described how he then appeared on Good Morning Britain, and on newspaper front pages, due to this video. Akkad stated that although he appreciates the Clap for Our Carers events, as they have made communities closer, he \\"cringe[s]\\" when he sees government members clapping, due to their handling of the pandemic. In an interview in August 2020, he explained that having experienced authoritarianism in Syria, he was becoming worried about \\"the creeping authoritarianism [which] is quite vivid here now\\", pointing out the \\"contracts going to government cronies; politicians breaking the rules and not facing consequences; this delusional democracy where people are lied to, and vote for the liars\\". He has started writing a memoir, which will be published in 2021 by Pan Macmillan. Personal life He is engaged to a Syrian woman he met in the UK, who was here as a student and whose home in Damascus was bombed. They were meant to get married in July 2020 in Leytonstone. His family also left Syria: his parents now live in the UAE, and his brother works for the World Food Programme in Yemen.

Prior campaigns  In 1989 the Derbyshire Direct Action Now Network (DDANN) was formed by local disabled people to protest against the pedestrianisation of Chesterfield. These protests resulted in police arrests and court hearings, where disabled people refused to plead guilty, all reading out the same defence to the court. One of the DDANN protesters was Alan Holdsworth, employed by the Derbyshire Coalition of Disabled People (DCDP) as a community link worker, along with many DCDP members including Ken Davis. Between 1990 and 1993 the London-based Campaign for Accessible Transport (CAT) held street demonstrations including Oxford Street. Its organisers included Tracey Proudlock, Sue Elsegood, and Alan Sutherland as the press officer. [source: GMCDP archive, Manchester] On 22 November 1991 in Leeds a protest by 150 disabled people and allies outside the BBC studios picketed the Children in Need live broadcasting under the banner of Rights Not Charity Group. Eight people were arrested, four were disabled people. On 18 July 1992 in London, over a thousand disabled people hold a protest outside the ITV studios (London Weekend TV) picketing the Telethon live broadcasting under the banner of Block Telethon. ITV later abandon this approach and create Comic Relief in consultation with disabled people and other oppressed groups. The main organisers were Barbara Lisicki and Alan Holdsworth, who had organised a smaller, similar protest against the Telethon broadcast in 1990 and had done further development work preparing for the 1992 protest.  Early years  The idea was to build on and sustain the campaigning energy from the Block Telethon protest, and in 1993 a weekend residential conference was held by about 15 interested disabled people using the guest rooms in the grounds of the Disabled Drivers Association at Ashwellthorpe Hall near Norwich. The debate was essentially between creating a general civil rights campaign or creating a campaign based on specific target issues, starting with inaccessible public transport. The eventual vote was in favour of specific targets, the argument being that it would visibly engage more disabled people. The first public action by DAN was in July 1993 in Christchurch when a Parliamentary by-election was unexpectedly called, and the Conservative candidate, tipped to win, had previously taken a hostile position in the House of Commons by opposing new legislation which would have given civil rights to disabled people to legally challenge discrimination. He lost the election, and it showed that DAN had political clout and skills at a national level. [source: GMCDP archive, Manchester]  Structure and Methods  DAN was a network of individual disabled people and allies. The network maintained coverage across the UK through a team of regional organisers. A national committee of disabled people existed for most of DAN's active years, including many of the regional organisers. A newsletter was produced, especially in the build-up and winding-down from a major action.  National Actions  Over the years DAN organised around 60 actions [listed in GMCDP archive, Manchester] of which around 15 were national actions. Typically a local action took place on a single day, whereas national actions developed into three-day long events, usually from Friday to Sunday. The Christchurch protest was the first national action, followed by Trafalgar Square, Westminster Central Hall (both 1994), Cardiff, Birmingham (1995), Nottingham, Derby (1996), London, Bristol (1997), London, Newcastle, Hull (1998), Bournemouth, London (1999) and London (2001). [source: GMCDP archive, Manchester]  Legacy  In the UK in May 1997 there was a change of government with the Labour party winning and with Tony Blair MP as the new Prime Minister. However, many disabled people had misgivings about the unclear proposals coming from the New Labour government ministers on what was called by some, welfare reform, and called cuts by others. On 22 December 1997 DAN and other organisations had organised a one-day protest against these forthcoming cuts, held in Trafalgar Square. A group of \\"Danners\\" broke away from this rally and headed down Whitehall towards the gates of Downing Street. They had red paint hidden inside paper coffee cups, and throwing the paint on themselves they protested on the floor in front of the gates for the TV news crews that were stationed there for any sudden political news reasons. The protest was named after one of the banners, \\"Blair's Blood\\". As well as being shown on UK national news, the protest details and images went around the world, including the front page of the New York Times. Although there were cuts in welfare benefits for disabled people, and especially after 2010 and the austerity programme of the Coalition government, it can be argued that the 1997 protest at least paused these cuts for some years. This campaigning has continued in the UK with Disabled People Against Cuts, DPAC. On 20 November 2001, supported by DAN in the UK and disabled people's campaigns across all the European Union countries, and coordinated by the European Disability Forum and the Buses for All campaign, all new buses used anywhere in the EU had to be fully accessible by EU law, with a timetable. Double deckers were the last bus type to become fully accessible.  Television  In 1995 the TV documentary Desperate DAN was broadcast as part of the Over the Edge series of BBC disability programming. It focused on national actions by DAN members in London and Cardiff. [citation needed] On 19 May 2020 the BBC announced it had commissioned Dragonfly Film and TV Productions and One Shoe Productions to make a dramatised account of aspects of DAN for future broadcasting on BBC2 TV channel in the UK. The basis of the programme will centre on two DAN members and on the political debates within the disabled people's movement leading up to the passing of the Disability Discrimination Act in 1995, regarded by many disabled people as a compromised and inadequate law for their civil rights. The rationale for the programme is to mark the 25th anniversary of the creation of that law (which was later absorbed into the Equality Act 2010).

The anniversary in Hong Kong took place despite a ban by the government under pretext of restrictions owing to the COVID-19 pandemic; future anniversaries are under threat of national security legislation for Hong Kong enacted by the National People's Congress in Beijing in May 2020, but it is claimed by law experts that gatherings and mournings alone would not constitute a breach of the law.  Background  Since 1989, Hong Kong has been the only place on Chinese soil where the Tiananmen Square massacre is publicly commemorated. The 31st anniversary is set against the world-wide Covid-19 pandemic and intense political conflict and civil unrest since June 2019. Furthermore, the National People's Congress voted to impose a national security law on Hong Kong which would outlaw subversion and has cemented fears that the concept of \\"one country, two systems\\" ‚Äì which buffers Hong Kong from mainland China ‚Äì was being seriously undermined. Pro- establishment member of the Basic Law committee, Maria Tam, warned participants at future rallies that it would be wise to leave any demonstration if they heard others shouting slogans opposing ‚Äúone-party dictatorship‚Äù. In 2020, the Hong Kong government invoked Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance, imposing a 4-person limit for public gatherings, and many observers believe that the coronavirus pandemic provided cover for an increase of arrests related to the protests.  Online  A US-based NGO led by Zhou Fengsuo, former student leader of the Tiananmen protests, hosted a 3-hour online commemoration on 31 May which was attended by 250 participants. The event had to be kept under wraps until the last minute due to the reuniting of many high-profile figures with direct ties to the pro-democracy movement.https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/3088520/zoom-closes-account- us-based-chinese-dissidents-after-tiananmen Tiananmen Mothers had been invited to address the meeting. On 7 June the organisation's paid Zoom account was shut down. No reply was forthcoming despite repeated email requests for an explanation. Zoom Video Communications issued a press statement confirming that the account had been shut, citing the need \\"to comply with local law\\", but said it had since been re- activated.https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/zoom-censors- video-talks-on-hong-kong-and-tiananmen-drawing- criticism/2020/06/11/0197dc94-ab90-11ea-a43b-be9f6494a87d_story.html  Mainland China  Tiananmen Square in Beijing was reportedly empty and quiet on the day. Pedestrians' identification documents were checked at security checkpoints upon entry to the square, and nationwide mass surveillance was tightened to prevent any commemoration of the event. Human rights groups reported that, as in recent years, dissidents had been sent away or placed under house arrest and their communications cut off.  Hong Kong  Following the emergence of three cases of local transmission, the government extended its coronavirus social distancing measures by 14 days, to 4 June, affecting the annual vigil in Victoria Park. The government denied suggestions that the extension was aimed at interfering with the commemoration, saying the decision was made in accordance with its extension policy. Whilst announcing that it would relax restrictions on religious gatherings and that high school students would restart school the next Wednesday (3 June), the Hong Kong government decreed that public gatherings of more than eight people would remain prohibited. Concerned that the vigil will not be permitted, Lee Cheuk-yan, chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China (ASPDM) which organises the annual vigil pointed to the contradiction between a possible ban and a relaxation of health measures. He accused the government of political interference. He invited Hongkongers to \\"blossom everywhere\\" and turn the vigil into a tribute across the entire city. Finally, the police issued a letter of objection to the organisers, citing health restrictions on gatherings of more than eight people. The Alliance announced that, in the absence of an official vigil, 60 booths would be set up across the city on 4 June to distribute candles starting in the afternoon. Lee said that members would still be allowed to enter Victoria Park that night, but called on the public to light candles across the city and join an online gathering. In response to the government ban, the memorial activities have become more diffuse throughout Hong Kong. The ASPDM organised a long-distance running event on the preceding Sunday starting at 8.45 am, with Victoria Park as the end point; participants ran in groups of eight. Literary groups PEN Hong Kong and Cha: An Asian Literary Journal held English-language book readings on 3 June \\"To honour the struggle of the democracy protesters, mourn their defeat, and take stock of the last three decades and more\\"; citizens organised commemorations of the massacre in districts throughout Hong Kong. After issuing a letter of objection to the organisers, the police announced that some 3,000 riot police would be deployed to enforce the ban. Police warned that even if participants split into smaller groups, they would still be in breach of the law. Notwithstanding, tens of thousands gathered at Victoria Park to attend the vigil, afraid that time was running out on the anniversary in Hong Kong. In various districts across Hong Kong, thousands remembered the brutal suppression by the communist party. There were significant crowds in Kwun Tong and Mong Kok. While no violence was reported in or around Victoria Park, scuffles were reported in Mong Kok where hundreds had gathered. As part of the continuing civil unrest, protesters who blocked roads with various objects were met with police officers who used pepper spray to disperse them. Security was tight around the Liaison Office, and activists were blocked from the site. On the day of the anniversary, the Legislative Council of Hong Kong passed a bill to outlaw the insulting of the Chinese national anthem, where those convicted of intentionally abusing it could face up to three years in prison and a fine of HK$50,000 ($6,450). The bill was supported by 41 lawmakers, all from pro-Beijing factions, and just one legislator opposed. Most of the pro-democracy lawmakers boycotted the vote in protest. Lee Cheuk-yan, Albert Ho and Jimmy Lai have since been told by the police to expect a court summons for incitement to illegal assembly on 4 June. Lee stated in response that \\"police are abusing their power to arrest, the Department of Justice is abusing its power to prosecute and trying to [intimidate] the people of Hong Kong when they exercise our right to assembly‚Äù. A group of 24 activists were charged on 6 August who had taken part in the vigil marking the anniversary with ‚Äúknowingly taking part in an unauthorised assembly‚Äù. These included the now exiled Nathan Law, disqualified pro-democracy candidates for the aborted 2020 Hong Kong legislative election Joshua Wong, Lester Shum, Tiffany Yuen, Gwyneth Ho.https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3096343/hong-kong- activists-joshua-wong-nathan-law-among-24-charged  Macau  In Macau, where anniversary is remembered in a considerably more low key manner, the government revoked permission to hold an annual photographic exhibition themed on the massacre in 1989, on the pretext of the \\"standardisation of use of public spaces\\", drawing criticism from democratic advocates.  Czech Republic  Hong Kong artist Loretta Lau, who is in Prague pursuing a masters degree in visual arts, held a vigil in Wenceslas Square where she presented a new work: Back to the Spring of Tiananmen. During the ceremony, she aimed to light 64 candles, followed by collective meditation with the other participants.

Raised in February 1952 it was disbanded on 1 May 1996. The unit's role was to conduct geodetic surveys, topographic surveys, compile and cartographically complete topographic maps, acquire aerial mapping photography and to distribute topographic products for land combat operations. The unit's primary area of responsibility was South Australia and Northern Territory but the squadron was tasked for operations in Queensland, Victoria, Papua New Guinea (1972-1974) and nations in the south west Pacific area (1986-1994).

Early field surveys and mapping were concentrated around capital cities and important port facilities. In the late-1920s a sub-section of the Survey Section - Royal Australian Engineers (Permanent) moved from Brisbane QLD to Adelaide SA to commence work there. During the Second World War there were no Army survey units based in South Australia but military survey maps were produced as part of the emergency mapping program in collaboration with the State Lands Department. In the Northern Territory 7th Field Survey Section was relieved in April 1943 by 1 Section 6th Army Topographic Survey Company after serving for two years in that theatre. 1 Section remained in Northern Australia until war's end. From 1946 to 1951 Army Headquarters (AHQ) Field Survey Section (Melbourne VIC) and a detachment from 5th Field Survey Company (Sydney NSW) conducted surveys in South Australia for nationally important projects such as the Woomera Rocket Range and industrial development around the upper Spencer Gulf areas of Whyalla, Port Augusta and Port Pirie. AHQ Field Survey Section (Central Command Detachment) with an establishment of three officers and twenty-two other ranks was formed in Adelaide at Largs Bay in February 1952 to take responsibility for mapping of Woomera and military mapping in all parts of the state. The section was redesignated Central Command Field Survey Section in 1953 moving into Hampstead Barracks and then moving to Keswick Barracks in 1954. The unit was redesignated Central Command Field Survey Unit in 1961 moving to the old cavalry stables in what became a part of a purpose built facility occupied in 1973. In 1970 the unit was redesignated 4th Field Survey Squadron with an increased establishment of five officers and seventy-five other ranks until that was reduced in the mid-1970s to five officers and forty-seven other ranks. In 1973 command of the unit moved from the regional command (HQ 4th Military District - Keswick Barracks, Adelaide SA) to the functional command structure under HQ Field Force Command - Victoria Barracks, Sydney NSW. This organisation remained until the major Corps restructure in 1989/90 when the unit was the only remaining Corps field survey unit in Australia and was moved under command Army Survey Regiment. At this time it was increased in strength to nine officers and sixty-eight other ranks. Command changed again in 1993 when 4 Fd Svy Sqn was again a direct command unit of Land Command until it was disbanded in 1996. On disbandment the personnel establishment was transferred to augment 1st Topographic Survey Squadron to enhance the field deployable survey capability. Operations All four Australian based field survey squadrons (1,2,4 and 5 Fd Svy Sqns) had the capability to conduct geodetic and topographic surveys, compile maps to the pre-cartographic draughting stage from aerial photography using photogrammetric methods, field check preliminary maps and acquire aerial photography to identify survey stations. From the late-1970s field survey units could cartographically complete maps to the pre-press stage. From 1990, 4 Fd Svy Sqn had the capability to acquire large-block mapping quality aerial photography. From 1981 to 1994 personnel from the squadron co-operated the joint Aust/US permanent fixed Global Positioning System (GPS) station at Smithfield SA. In addition to standard survey and mapping operations, the squadron was responsible for surveys and mapping of military training areas and defence installations and was routinely tasked with a miscellany of survey work.

The mythical origins date back to the Roman general Placidus, who lived at the time of Trajan (II century) and later became Saint Eustace, but the family is historically documented from the IX century, when Leone d'Afflitto was appointed Duke of Amalfi. The family fiefdoms were scattered throughout Southern Italy: Sicily, Apulia, Calabria, Basilicata and the Abruzzi. There are records of 5 principalities, 5 dukedoms, 5 marquisates, 6 earldoms, 49 baronies, in addition to the current title of Marquis (male-line primogeniture), Patrician of Amalfi (male-line). Alongside the nobles of Scala, Amalfi and Naples, the family expressed royal officials for the Angevin, Bourbon, Habsburg and Savoy dynasties, as well as jurists, clericals and military commanders. The d'Afflitto family is regarded as one of the founding families of the Order of Malta, with Landolfo and his son Jacopo travelling and fighting alongside Blessed Gerard in the Crusades in the Holy Land. Father and son are mentioned in Torquato Tasso's Jerusalem Conquered. Don Camponello, Lord of Rodegaldo, was instead Grand Master of the Knights Templar in 1235. The family is related to several illustrious aristocratic families of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and Southern, and Northern Italy.  The origins: from Castrum Pini to Scala (XI and XII century)  Genealogists have considered that the different forms of the surname d'Afflitto, that is d'Africto, de Fricto, de Flicto, de Afflicto, de Afflictis, and their variants, are attributable to the same family. With regard to the original form de or da Filicto, in particular, it has been more recently proposed to be derived from the term afflictus, as a variant of affictus, with the meaning of tax or income. One of the first documentary evidence of the family dates back to March 7, 1041. They instead arrived in Scala in the Norman age (1131‚Äì1194); the family became domini, that is, members of the town's aristocracy. Some bishops from the same city, established as diocese around 1069, also belonged to the family: Orso (ca. 1144), Alessandro II (1171‚Äì1191 ca.), Costantino (1207‚Äì1220 ca.), Matteo (1227‚Äì1269 ca). Later there were Natale Mastini d‚ÄôAfflitto (1418‚Äì1450) and Francesco (1583‚Äì1593). In 1280‚Äì1282, the d'Afflitto were several times judges of Scala. In 1144, Bishop Orso donated to the church of St. Stephanie in the same town two silver deer bearing the insignia of the d'Afflitto. The gift would suggest the spread at this time of the tradition about the family's lineage from St. Eustace, a Roman general under Emperor Trajan. An episode in the legend of the Saint is centred on a deer that, during a hunting trip, would have appeared to the Roman general Placidus, who then went down in history as Saint Eustace, carrying the Cross and the figure of Christ between his horns. From the wills of the members, it emerges, between the XI and XII centuries, the existence of a conspicuous estate comprising palaces and properties in Benevento, as well as properties in Scala and throughout the Duchy of Amalfi.  The family spreads to southern Italy  The family moved to Amalfi in the XII century. In 1157, therefore, Pietro lived at Capo di Croce, while in 1181, Judge Riccardo lived in a Domus located near the cathedral, which still preserves the family tombs. The presence of the family in Monopoli is documented in 1187, while in Ravello it is attested in 1195. The d'Afflitto from Scala also had marital relations with the most important families of Ravello. In this city, the d'Afflitto family built several palaces, the first in front of the church of Saints John the Baptist and Evangelist. Palazzo d'Afflitto in Ravello houses a renowned hotel. Villa Rufolo was also owned by the family for a short period during the Middle Ages. They probably came to Naples in the early Swabian age. In the year 1245, under the reign of Emperor Frederick II, Enrico di Scala and his son Federico, probably from Ravello, were among the nobles of the Seat of Nido. Especially in the Angevin era, in fact, merchants, but also crown officials, belonging to the families of Amalfi, were ennobled and admitted into the ranks of the chivalry. This branch of the family, settled in Naples, became extinct in the mid-XV century. The d'Afflitto enjoyed nobility in Naples also in the Seats of Porto and Portanova, but their merchant activity is also well documented. From Antonio, Regent of the Vicariate Curia at the beginning of the XV century, descended Michele, Treasurer of the Kingdom of Naples (1485‚Äì1499), in 1496 feudal lord in Gaeta and Abruzzi, Lieutenant of the Sommaria (from 1504 onwards), Grand Chamberlain and first Count of Trivento in 1505. Girolamo (1617‚Äì1662), Duke of Barrea, Count of Trivento and Prince of Scanno from 1646. The members of the family, in the XV and XVI centuries, were engaged in public office, ecclesiastical career and military service, while continuing to carry out mercantile, banking and insurance activities for a long time. The Family also settled in Tropea, Brindisi and Cosenza.  Main family branches  The family split into several branches, in particular: # Branch of the Counts of Trivento, then Dukes of Barrea and Princes of Scanno, ascribed in Naples to the Seat of Porto, extinct in the Caracciolo di Melissano; # Branch of the Counts of Loreto, extinct into the previous branch; # Branch of the Princes of Belmonte, descended from the aforementioned Bartolomeo (died 1240) in Sicily and extinct into the Ventimiglia family; # Branch of the Barons of Monteroduni and Macchia, also extinct into the Imperiali family; # Branch of the Dukes of Campomele and Castropignano, Marquises of Frignano Maggiore, Montefalcone and Agropoli, extinct into the Nunziante family.

While there is proven research and data that shows that the quality and completeness of an audit improves drastically from newer automated tools, many audit firms continue to use their out-dated programs due to their risk-averse attitudes. Audit technology has been evolving drastically in recent years, and the implementation of the technology is a heavily debated subject among auditors, but ultimately it leads to more educated professional judgement decisions.  Background  The history of information technology in auditing has a pretty short timeline, as information technology has really only begun to improve in the last 20 years. Prior to that, audit opinions were made with much less reliable evidence as testing accounts manually is much more tedious and time-consuming. With rapid improvements in the last two decades of both firm technology and client technology, audits have become much more substantive and reliable. Technology not only improves the quality of the audit, but it also helps an audit get completed in a more timely manner. Firms that have the best levels of technology can charge the highest wages as they can conduct a quality and efficient audit. In addition, firms that have the best technology systems reduce their costs, allowing them to edge competition out in obtaining clients by offering lower wages.  Decision-Making Processes Affected by Technology  There are different ways in which technology affects the decision-making of auditors. Some decisions that have been researched are in relation to the implementation of audit technology and auditor professional judgement. Other research has gone deeper into the psychological effects of having improved audit technology. = Technology Implementation = Decision- making behind whether or not to implement newer audit technologies has been researched and examined closely. There are several environmental and personal characteristics that affect the decision-making on the implementation of upgraded audit tools. Two environmental factors that affect the outcome of the decision is the budget length of the audit, as well as the availability to consistently talk to the auditors' superiors. It turns out that the longer the budget length of audit engagement, the better chance an auditor would implement a brand new technology. The same goes for if the superior is less available, this also makes the auditor feel more comfortable in implementing a new technology. Ceteris paribus, if these environmental factors were already set before the opportunity to make a decision on the implementation of a new technology, then the auditors individual characteristics would be the driving cause for the decision to implement. It comes down to whether the auditor is risk-seeking or risk-adverse in nature. The decision to implement technology can also depend on the size of the firm. Some smaller audit firms don't deal with large clients, therefore, its not seen as worth it to upgrade their technologies. A study was conducted in the United Kingdom in order to see how many smaller firms had implemented a relatively new accounting system called Generalized Audit Software (GAS), and the results showed almost 3 out of every 4 firms did not use GAS due to little perceived benefit. The decision to implement audit technology is rarely in one individual auditors hands. Many times its a firm-wide decision to use a new audit tool, as firms like to keep their audits relatively consistent from client to client. Therefore, it is more likely that large firms with large amounts of resources will implement the most up-to-date technologies. This gives them an advantage in terms of the quality of their audits and the speed in which they can conduct their audits. This allows the large firms to offer a higher price for their services and allows them to compete with other large firms to acquire new clients. All in all, the progression in technology is going to continue to put pressure on smaller firms to compete with firms like the Big 4.Louis-Philippe Sirois, Sophie Marmousez, Dan Simunic. Big 4 and non-Big 4 Audit Production Costs: Office Level Audit Technology and the Impact on Audit Fees. Comptabilit√©s et innovation, May 2012, Grenoble, France. pp.cd-rom. ffhal-00691147 Technology implementation, regardless of if it is on an individual auditor basis or firm- wide basis, is something the audit practice has recently been exposed to that forces these parties into tough decision-making positions. = Professional Judgement = An auditor's professional judgement is to be used throughout the audit and is expected to be used based on the information given and the evidence obtained. Through the improvement of audit technology and the accounting systems at a firm's clients, the ability to see where red flags are in a companies financial records is much easier. On top of that, once something seemingly off is identified, its much easier for an auditor to trace or vouch the numbers through the use of the improved technologies, making the use of professional judgement simpler and more effective as more and more information is available to the auditor. Professional judgement is a key component of an auditors job, and with the assistance of computer-assisted audit tools, many manual task are no longer necessary and can allow auditors to focus more on their professional judgement calls.Rosli, K., Yeow, P., & Siew, E. (2012). Factors Influencing Audit Technology Acceptance by Audit Firms: A New I-TOE Adoption Framework. Journal of Accounting and Auditing: Research & Practice, 1-11. doi:10.5171/2012.876814 Other research concluded that as information technology continues to improve, decision-making will continue to get simpler, ultimately leading to less stress for the auditor.Umar, M., Sitorus, S. M., Surya, R. L., Shauki, E. R., & Diyanti, V. (2017). Pressure, Dysfunctional Behavior, Fraud Detection and Role of Information Technology in the Audit Process. Australasian Accounting, Business and Finance Journal, 11(4), 102-115. doi:10.14453/aabfj.v11i4.8 The psychological aspect of being an auditor is important. Many studies have supported that auditors get burnt-out during \\"busy season\\" and they in turn have increased stress levels limiting their abilities to perform at their highest level. Less stress auditors are able to better use their professional judgement, improving the quality of their audits, ultimately leading to the overall conclusion that audit technology is an improvement for the practice as a whole and for business in general.  Future of Audit Technology  The future of audit is going to be driven by the technological advancements that will continue occur over the next couple decades. As data continues to get processed at faster rates, audits will only get done with higher quality and enhanced efficiency. The Big 4 public accounting firms spend large sums of money on the innovation of audit tools, hoping it will give them an edge in the competitive industry. The competitive nature of the industry forces these firms to innovate quicker, continuously changing the way the world conducts audits.

Two closely related terms, Low Frequency Analyzer and Recorder and Low Frequency Analysis and Recording bearing the acronym LOFAR, deal with the equipment and process respectively for presenting a visual spectrum representation of low frequency sounds in a time‚Äìfrequency analysis. The process was originally applied to fixed surveillance passive antisubmarine sonar systems and later to sonobuoy and other systems. Originally the analysis was electromechanical and the display was produced on electrostatic recording paper, a Lofargram, with stronger frequencies presented as lines against background noise. The analysis migrated to digital and both analysis and display were digital after a major system consolidation into centralized processing centers during the 1990s. Both the equipment and process had specific and classified application to fixed surveillance sonar systems and was the basis for the United States Navy's ocean wide Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) established in the early 1950s. The research and development of systems utilizing LOFAR was given the code name Project Jezebel. The installation and maintenance of SOSUS was under the unclassified code name Project Caesar. The principle was later applied to air, surface and submarine tactical sonar systems with some incorporating the name \\"Jezebel\\". Origin In 1949 when the US Navy approached the Committee for Undersea Warfare, an academic advisory group formed in 1946 under the National Academy of Science, to research antisubmarine warfare. As a result, the Navy formed a study group designated Project Hartwell under Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) leadership. The Hartwell panel recommended that spending of annually to develop systems to counter the Soviet submarine threat consisting primarily of a large fleet of diesel submarines. One recommendation was a system to monitor low-frequency sound in the SOFAR channel using multiple listening sites equipped with hydrophones and a processing facility that could calculate submarine positions over hundreds of miles.The cited Project HARTWELL report first links arrays with fleet type submarines towing such an array in the GIUK then refers to potential exploitation of the deep sound channel low frequency sounds. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) then contracted with American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T;), with its Bell Laboratories research and Western Electric manufacturing elements, to develop a long range, passive detection system, based on bottom arrays of hydrophones. The proposed development was based on AT&T;'s sound spectrograph, which converted sound into a visual spectrogram representing a time‚Äìfrequency analysis of sound that was developed for speech analysis and modified to analyze low-frequency underwater sounds. The proposed system offered such promise of long-range submarine detection that the Navy ordered immediate moves for implementation. Application to undersea surveillance A working model of the Low Frequency Analyzer and Recorder was delivered in May 1951 which operated with real time analysis of a frequency band of 1 to 1/2 Hz. Along with the working model was a proposal for hydrophones, cables, processing systems and beamforming so that a hydrophone array could present multiple azimuthal beams to be displayed. Lofargram writers, one for each array beam, on a NAVFAC watch floor. Each system, from shore facility to the transducer array was a sonar set with the signal processing beginning as the array's signals were amplified, processed into beams by time delay and each beam processed by an electromechanical spectrum analyzer with the display being a sweep of the frequency spectrum's intensity burned across electrostatic recording paper moving on the time axis. The sweeps of the stylus recording the intensity of sound along the frequency axis formed a time record of background noise and specific frequency receptions that formed lines. When representing frequencies generated by propeller blades or machinery those could form a submarine or surface ship signature that could be recognized and used to locate and identify the source. The frequency against time line can show frequency variations from a specific source and thus changes in behavior of the source. With regard to vessels that could be speed or other changes, including a Doppler shift indicating direction changes, having an effect of frequencies received.The lofargram illustration at the top illustrates such a distinctive frequency shift in a line. After successful tests with a U.S. submarine using a test array at Eleuthera the Navy ordered six LOFAR systems for installation. The shore stations where the operational array and cable, composing a surveillance sonar set, terminated, were given the generic and non revealing term Naval Facilitity (NAVFAC). The watch floor of a NAVFAC had banks of displays, one for each beam of the array. The first phase of installations was largely complete during the years 1954 and 1958. A system wide signal processing upgrade began in September of 1963 in which the electromechinacal analyzer was replaced by digital spectrum analysis with an upgrade of the display recorders. the spectrum analysis system was further upgraded with systems retrofitted between 1966 and 1967. A new system installed in 1973 began a general upgrade to full digital signal analysis that continued into 1981. That system, using a high capacity digital computer, fully digitized the spectrum analysis and had some automatic detection of acoustic signatures. The system of electrostatic displays was not replaced by digital displays until the 1990s consolidation of the array systems terminating at individual Naval Facilities being routed into central processing facilities. Other antisubmarine warfare applications A parallel research and development effort to explore applications was given the name Project Jezebel. The origin of the project name was explained by Dr. Robert Frosch to Senator Stennis during a 1968 hearing. It was because of the low frequencies, \\"about the A below middle C on the piano\\" (about 100-150 cycles) and \\"Jezebel\\" being chosen because \\"she was of low character.\\" Jezebel and LOFAR branched into the localization of submarines with the AN/SSQ-28 passive omnidirectional Jezebel-LOFAR sonobuoy introduced in 1956 for use by the air antisubmarine forces. That sonobuoy gave the aircraft cued by SOSUS access to the same low frequency and LOFAR capability as SOSUS. Bell Telephone Laboratories time delay correlation was used to fix target position with two or more sonobuoys in a technique named COrrelation Detection And Ranging (CODAR). This, and later specialized, sonobuoys equipped with a small explosive charge could be used in an active mode to detect the echo off the target. The active mode was named by engineers developing the technique \\"Julie\\" after a burlesque dancer whose \\"performance could turn passive buoys active.\\"  Footnotes References Category:Anti-submarine warfare Category:Military sonar equipment of the United States Category:Signal processing Category:Time‚Äìfrequency analysis ","title":"Low Frequency Analyzer and Recorder (LOFAR)"},{"id":"64034226","text":"Levon Abrahamian at Cultural Heritage & Armenia‚Äôs Revolution Levon H.

She took the organisation of six volunteers to organise hospitals and nursing stations in France and Belgium in the First World War. In 1916 the British Army agreed that it too could use the FANY's support and Franklin was the first driver and in command. She left the FANY in 1932. Life Franklin's birth day is not known but she lived for a time at Hook, Surrey. Her parents were William and Louisa and she had a brother. The FANY was formed to both rescue the wounded and to administer first aid from horseback. Their founder felt that a single rider could get to a wounded soldier faster than a horse- drawn ambulance. Each woman was trained not only in first aid but signalling and drilling in cavalry movements. The organisation was troubled and Mabel St Clair Stobart formed the rival Women's Sick and Wounded Convoy Corps in 1910. Only six women were to remain in the FANY and Lilian Franklin was one of them. At the start of 1912 she was a second lieutenant, and she and Sergeant-Major Ashley-Smith won a power struggle with the FANY founder Edward Baker and his daughter, Katie. In 1912 the FANY uniform became a khaki tunic, khaki riding skirt and later a khaki soft cap. Franklin and Ashley-Smith were in charge; before the First World War started in 1914, Franklin and Ashley-Smith are credited with reinventing the FANY after the disagreement with the founders had been settled. First World War Franklin with the FANY in Calais in 1917 In 1914, the FANY offered their service to the War Office, but they were ignored despite a recommendation from the surgeon-general. They could have stood back but they were determined and they offered their service to the French and the Belgians and they would run casualty stations and hospitals for them. In 1916, the British Army changed its mind and they decided that they could use the FANY. On New Year's Day, Franklin was in command and she was the first woman driver in the British army as a convoy was formed at Calais. After the war Mary Baxter Ellis was leading the Northumberland section in 1928 and she took over from Franklin in 1932. Franklin died in Horsham. Honours In 1917 Franklin was mentioned in dispatches.

He was the director of surveys and excavations at the Israel Antiquities Authority (1999‚Äì2001) and the curator of the Patriarchal Museum in Jerusalem (1984‚Äì2004).  Early life and ecclesiastic career  Tzaferis was born on 1 April 1936 on the Greek island of Samos. He began studying theology at the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem in 1950. He took monastic vows and was ordained a deacon in 1956 and a priest in 1958. Considering leaving the priesthood to study in Athens, he instead obtained permission from Benedict I of Jerusalem to study history and archaeology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem whilst retaining his monastic habit. Tzaferis left the church in 1964, in order to marry. Now required to perform mandatory military service in Greece, he also renounced his Greek citizenship in order to remain in Israel. He continued his studies at the Hebrew University and began working as a field archaeologist for the Israel Department of Antiquities (now known as the Israel Antiquities Authority).  Archaeological career  Tzaferis went on to obtain an MA and PhD in classical archaeology from the Hebrew University. He was awarded his PhD in 1971, with a dissertation on the \\"development of the cross as a Christian symbol\\". He continued working at the Department of Antiquities for the rest of his career, being appointed first deputy director (1971) and then director (1999) of its Division for Surveys and Excavations, and retiring in 2001. He also served as the curator of the Patriarchal Museum in Jerusalem from 1984 to 2002 and was a member of the Supreme Archaeological Council of Israel. Tzaferis excavated at various sites in Jerusalem, as well as at Ashkelon, Beth She'an, Caesarea Philippi, Capernaum, Kursi, and Tel Dan. He made his best known discovery in 1968 at Givat HaMivtar: the remains of a crucified man named Yehohanan bar Hagkol, the only physical evidence of Roman crucifixion known to date. He also published research on Byzantine monasticism. Tzaferis died on 1 January 2015.

He served in the Navy during the First World War, and spent the interwar period writing books on naval history, and agitating at the Far-Right. During the Second World War, he eagerly collaborated with the Nazi, presiding a so-called \\"Comit√© d'action antibolch√©vique\\" (\\"committee for anti-Bolshevik action\\"). At the Liberation, he was arrested, tried to treason, and executed by firing squad.  Biography  Chack was born to Marie-Louise Chack, also known as \\"Marie Scalini\\" (1852‚Äì1931), and of Lord Fingall, who refused to marry her but still purchased a house for her and paid her a pension. Chack joined the √âcole navale in October 1893, the 50th of the 75 students of the class of that year. He graduated in 1896. He served on the battleship Hoche, then on Mass√©na in the North sea, and was promoted to Ensign first class in October 1898. He then served on Mouette at Constantinople, where he earned a Turkish medal by fighting a fire. Chack was promoted to lieutenant de vaisseau in May 1906, and given command of the submarine Grondin. In 1908, he was appointed as aid to the general governor of Indochina. He served on Jaur√©guiberry in 1912 as gunnery officer, and was promoted to the fire direction of the battleship Courbet in 1914. In June 1915, he was given command of the destroyer Massue, taking part in the Gallipoli campaign. On 27 November 1916, he attacked a German submarine, earning an Army-level mention in dispatches. Check was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander in July 1917, and to Commander in June 1920. He captained the battleship Provence in the Mediterranean before transferring to the Service historique de la marine as Direction 1921. In 1927, he was received as a member of the Acad√©mie de marine. He was promoted to Captain in July 1929, and retired from the Navy in November 1934 with the rank of Captain. From the 1920. Chack started writing numerous works about the Navy and naval history. Chack started mixing with Far-Right elements infiltrating the veteran associations of the time. He was vice-pr√©sident of the l'Association nationale des officiers combattants (ANOC), under Right-Wing personalities such as Colonel Jean Ferrandi and Charles Trochu. Chack was also president of the Club de l'Effort, an organisation founded by reserve officers, many of whom were members of the far-right Ligues. In 1937, he was among the Right-wing and Far-Right personalities in honouring Charles Maurras when he was freed from prison. He joined Jacques Doriot's Parti populaire fran√ßais (PPF) in 1937.L'Emancipation nationale du PPF le cite comme adh√©rent en janvier 1938: Jean-Paul Brunet, Jacques Doriot, du communisme au fascisme, Balland, 1986, Meeting of the Front r√©volutionnaire national at V√©l'd'Hiv on 11 April 1943.

Also present outside the frame: Henri Barb√©, Francis Desphelippon, Lucien Rebatet, Dr. Andr√© Rainsart, Georges Soul√®s, Kl√©ber Legay. During the Nazi Occupation, Chack supported Collaboration with the Third Reich. He also displayed a virulent antisemitism. He notably inaugurated the Institut d'√©tude des questions juives in May 1941, and wrote antisemitic editorials in journals. Chack was president of the Comit√© d‚Äôaction antibolch√©vique (1941‚Äì1944), an anticommunist and antisemitic propaganda outlet used as a recruitment organ for the L√©gion des volontaires fran√ßais contre le bolch√©visme. Chack inaugurated the exhibit Le Bolchevisme contre l'Europe, along with French and German fascists such as Paul Marion, Fernand de Brinon or Georges Claude. On 22 August 1944, after the Lib√©ration, Chack was arrested and imprisoned at Drancy, and then at Fresnes. He was trialed by the Cour de justice of Seine, sentenced to death on 18 December 1944 and shot on 9 January 1945, at fort de Montrouge, near Paris.

Fossil, Inc., 590 U.S. ___ (2020), was a United States Supreme Court case related to trademark law under the Lanham Act. In the 9-0 decision on judgement, the Court ruled that a plaintiff in a trademark infringement lawsuit is not required to demonstrate that the defendant willfully infringed on their trademark to claim lost profit damages.. Case background Part of the American Fossil Group's business is their line of clothing accessories including handbags. In 2002, Fossil signed a deal with Romag fasteners to use their magnetic fasteners for their handbags, which were both under Romag's patent and had trademarked elements. Around 2010, Fossil's leadership discovered that their subcontracted Chinese manufacturer had stopped purchasing the Romag fasteners and instead were using imitation ones in Fossil's products. On notifying Romag, Romag sought and obtained a preliminary injunction from Fossil from selling the affected line of handbags just prior to \\"Black Friday\\" in November 2010 as they proceeded to file patent and trademark infringement charges against Fossil in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, as well as against Macy's, whom Fossil exclusively sold their handbags through. A jury trial was held and a verdict reached by April 2014 in which Fossil was found to have infringed on both patent and trademark rights. Damages were initially awarded by the jury for patent royalties, and separate awards of for unjust enrichment and for deterrence for trademark infringement, with the latter based on the profits Fossil had earned from sales of their handbags. On review by the district court, Judge Janet Bond Arterton determined that while the jury correctly found Fossil had violated Romag's trademarks, they had not willfully disregarded the trademark, and precising case law within the Second Circuit Court of Appeals required willful violation for awards on profit to be justified, and thus vacated that part of the jury's award. Romag appealed to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing that the language of the Lanham Act did not require them to have shown Fossil to be willful of the trademark violation to obtain damages based on profits. This has been the subject of a number of cases in the federal court circuit since the Lanham Act had passed, and had created a body of split decisions. The Second Circuit reviewed both their own body of case law as well as from other Circuits and, in their decision in April 2016, upheld the District Court's ruling. Their decide came to interpretation of the provisions of the Lanham Act codified at of when \\"willful violation\\" of trademark, as codified at , could be subject to recovery by damages, considering amendments added to the law in 1999. While Romag had asserted that the 1999 amendments meant that both trademark infringement and trademark dilution were both covered by ¬ß 1117 and that they did not have to show any willful violation based on decisions from other Circuits, the Second Circuit relied on their own case history to determine that ¬ß 1117 only covered trademark dilution. Supreme Court Romag petitioned their case to the Supreme Court in March 2019, asking them to review the question of whether demonstrating willful trademark infringement was a prerequisite for an award of profit under the Lanham Act. The Court granted certiorari in June 2019. Oral arguments were held on January 14, 2020. Court observers saw that most of the Justices appeared to favor Romag's arguments to the structure and intent of the current state of the Lanham Act, following the \\"principles of equity\\" that Congress would expect one to be able to recover damages from profit without having to show intent for trademark infringement just as they had intended for trademark dilution despite how the structure of the act was written to potentially exclude that. Due to this, these observers felt that the Court would reverse the lower courts ruling. The Court's decision was issued on April 23, 2020, with all nine Justices concurring on the judgement to vacate the Second Circuit's decision and remand the case. The majority opinion was written by Justice Neil Gorsuch and joined by all but Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who wrote her own opinion that concurred with the judgement. Gorsuch's opinion focused on the \\"principles of equity\\" that Romag had presented in their case, that the law's intent and structure, including the articulation of mens rea (mental states) standards related to willfulness in trademark violations, gave weight that Congress intended for trademark infringement to be treated equally as trademark dilution. Justice Samuel Alito wrote a concurring opinion joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Elana Kagan that agreed with the majority's conclusion but caused that willfulness is \\"not an absolute precondition\\" for a profits award. In her own opinion, Justice Sotomayor cautioned on the reliance on the majority's use of the mens rea standards, as their decision could cause those truly unaware of infringement of trademark to be deemed willful, though agreed with the application in the specific case for Romag and Fossil.

It ceased its work in December 2011.  Origins 1989-1995  In 1981 the British Council of Organisations of Disabled People (BCODP) was created. In later years BCODP went through a number of changes in its name and structure, first in 1997 becoming the British Council of Disabled People, and in 2006 the United Kingdom's Disabled People's Council, finally closing in 2017 (BCODP/UKDPC 1981-2017). NCIL was part of a growing network of local CILs - in her book No Limits, Judy Hunt in chapter eight looks at the broad history of local CILs in England in contrast with those in the USA, including four case studies - Derbyshire, Hampshire, Greenwich, and Lambeth. In 1989 the European Network on Independent Living was formed to campaign for the right to independent living. The creation of ENIL led in the UK to the establishment of an Independent Living Committee of BCODP. The detailed history and policy background of independent living campaigns in the UK is discussed by John Evans in 2003.  Creation 1996  In 1996 BCODP decided to move from having a committee, and it created a staffed project called the National Centre for independent Living to consolidate and co-ordinate all the policy and campaigning work that was being done around independent living and, in particular, to pursue the campaign for direct payments.  Community Care (Direct Payments) Act 1996  One of the early achievements of the BCODP Independent Living Committee / NCIL was in persuading the government to bring in legislation to make direct payments for social care lawful. The Community Care (Direct Payments) Act was passed in 1996. Before this law, local authorities with social services departments were using ad-hoc arrangements to make payments via third parties and trust funds to be passed on to disabled people who employed their own personal assistants to pay their wages.  Creating Independent Futures 2001  On 6 December 2001 a national conference was held at the Old Trafford cricket grounds in Greater Manchester on Creating Independent Futures. The conference had a range of disabled campaigners as speakers, and it was written up by a funded project run by the Centre for Disability Studies (CDS) at the University of Leeds in collaboration with NCIL. The research arose from the work of the BCODP Research Committee, chaired by Professor Mike Oliver. This research was guided by a steering group consisting of Peter Beresford, Jane Campbell, John Evans, and Frances Hasler. In 2006 this work was included in a wider book on independent living by Colin Barnes and Geof Mercer, CDS staff members, with Hannah Morgan, the principal researcher.  Spin-out 2003  In 2003 NCIL became a spin-out independent organisation from BCODP and it was registered as a non-profit company, and later as a charity in 2006. This was an acrimonious change at times, not least because the NCIL project had attracted a substantial proportion of BCODP's total resources. The NCIL board membership was required to be 75% or more of disabled people, and affiliating organisations had to be promoting at least two of the four principles of: * independent living, * direct payments, * the social model of disability, and * personal assistants (PAs) users support.  Right to Control  In 2011 NCIL ran an event with the Greater Manchester Coalition of Disabled People (GMCDP) with the Trailblazer projects being run by DPOs (disabled people's organisations) across England as part of the Right to Control initiative.  Merger 2011  By October 2010 NCIL was informing its members that it was unlikely to be able to continue as a sustainable organisation, which had started with an exploratory meeting on 9 September 2009, and later reinforced with a new Conservative government in the UK in May 2010 committed to a policy of austerity which impacted especially hard on disabled people of working age. It was decided to agree to merge with two other organisations, RADAR and Disability Alliance. This happened on 1 January 2012, creating Disability Rights UK. The last CEO of NCIL was Sue Bott.

It ran from Hamilton to Port Dover, about , providing trans-shipping service between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, and with connections, to Lake Huron at Georgian Bay. Formed in 1834 as the Hamilton and Port Dover Railway, it rechartered in 1853 and purchased the Hamilton and Southwestern Railway in 1855. Nothing came of any of these companies. When the charter was renewed in December 1869, it was purchased by the newly formed H&LE.; Construction began in 1873, but the $1 million cost of driving up the Hamilton Mountain and building a bridge at the Grand River at Caledonia was too much too bear. The company ran out of cash after reaching Jarvis in January 1875, only a few miles short of Port Dover. The company was purchased by the well-financed Hamilton and North-Western Railway (H&NW;) in 1877. Through this merger, the H&NW; controlled a network that connected Lake Erie, Ontario, Simcoe and Huron. The line was finally completed to Port Dover the next year. In 1881, the Grand Trunk Railway purchased both the H&NW; and the competing Port Dover and Lake Huron Railway. The operations were merged over the next several years with a new station being built in GT style. GT's 1918 bankruptcy and subsequent formation of the Canadian National Railway (CNR) in 1923 led to the line becoming part of the Hagersville Subdivision. CN lifted the line between Jarvis and Port Dover in 1935. In 1969 they constructed a new line running to the Nanticoke industrial area on Lake Erie. The remaining spur from Garnet to Jarvis was lifted in the 1970s. The Southern Ontario Railway purchased several lines in the area in 1997, forming an extended route from Brantford to Nanticoke as their newly reformed Hagersville Sub. The section from Hamilton to Caledonia, including the run up Hamilton Mountain, was abandoned in 1997 as part of this purchase. Of the original line, only the section from Caledonia to Garnet remains in use. History Through the early 19th century, Toronto and Hamilton were locked in a battle to become Ontario's primary industrial center. With most of the banking power of the province located in Toronto, that city continued to win new businesses, especially railway lines, and by the 1850s began to dominate shipping in the province. Looking to address this problem, businessmen in Hamilton began planning a network of new rail lines that would provide more convenient shipping than Toronto due to their location at the very western tip of Lake Ontario. On 22 April 1853, the Hamilton and Port Dover Railway was created to connect the two cities, providing transshipment between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, as well as connections to the Great Western Railway for shipment east and west. Two years later, it purchased the assets of the moribund Hamilton and Southwestern Railway, which had been chartered in 1834 but never raised capital for construction. The H&PD; did no better than the H&SW; in fundraising and no construction was carried out. After 15 years the charter came up for renewal, and on 24 December 1869 a new company was charted to buy the rights of the H&PD.; The new Hamilton and Lake Erie Railway (H&LER;) was more successful in fundraising, and finally began construction of the route in 1873. This was, unfortunately, also the year the Panic of 1873 which started the Long Depression, making further fundraising extremely difficult. By January 1875 the line was complete for to Jarvis, only short of its goal in Port Dover. However, the $1 million cost of running the line up Mount Hamilton and building a bridge across the Grand River at Caledonia had eaten up the company's funding, and further construction was abandoned. On 5 August 1877 the company was purchased by the Hamilton and North-Western Railway (H&NW;), who were in the process of completing the last leg of their route to Collingwood. Through the purchase, the H&NW; now had a route that connected Lake Erie, Ontario and Georgian Bay on Lake Huron. They began surveying the final section south of Jarvis in May, finally reaching Port Dover in June 1878. By this time, the Port Dover and Lake Huron Railway (PD&LH;), chartered in 1875, had already reached the town in 1875 and had subsequently built up an extensive dockyard area on the west side of the Lynn River that precluded further construction on the shore. Instead, the H&NW; built the terminal slightly up the Lynn River. In June 1879, the H&NW; merged with its former nemesis, the Northern Railway of Canada, and began consolidating its routes. They arranged an agreement with the PD&LH; to share the docks and grain silo downtown, and built a bridge over the Lynn. In 1887, the entire group of lines was purchased by the rapidly expanding Grand Trunk Railway (GTR), completing the takeover on 24 January 1888. As part of the GTRs bankruptcy in 1918, the lines eventually became part of the Canadian National Railway on 31 January 1923. The portion from Jarvis to Port Dover was abandoned on 13 July in 1935 and lifted shortly thereafter, along with the bridge over the Lynn River, as the company also controlled the PD&LH;'s more convenient route into town. The last passenger train to Port Dover ran in 1957. In 1969, CNR constructed a new branch line south from Garnet into the newly built industrial area at Nanticoke, leaving the short section between Garnet and Jarvis as a spur. The spur was lifted some time in the 1970s. Many of the lines in the area were purchased by the Southern Ontario Railway in 1997. As part of the purchase, they reorganized the route to run primarily on the Buffalo, Brantford and Goderich Railway, which crossed the H&LE; at Caledonia, and this became the main route for shipments ultimately going to Nanticoke. The section from Hamilton to Garnet was lifted that year. This leaves only the section from Caledonia to Garnet in use today, part of the reorganized Hagersville Subdivision. Route :From the Ontario Railway Map Collection, unless otherwise noted. Starting in Hamilton, the H&LE; starts at the dockyard areas in what is today known as Industrial Sector A. The line ran for a short distance in the dockyards before starting to run southwest parallel Ferguson Avenue. The first station was on Ferguson at Main Street. A short distance beyond the station the line bends 90 degrees to run southeastward upward along the edge of the Niagara Escarpment. It runs about to the area near modern Kenilworth Avenue, where it turned southwest again, now on top of Hamilton Mountain. After another was Rymal station. From Rymal the line runs almost perfectly straight to Caledonia, bending slightly westward to meet the Buffalo, Brantford and Goderich in a large wye on the southeast side of town. It follows that line only a few hundred meters before bending southwest again to cross the Grand River, running almost straight to Hagersville and then Jarvis where it bends westward for a short distance before returning to its original route for the final run to Port Dover. It turns only slightly in Port Dover, running more westward into town, before turning sharply southward for its final approach to the dock area. Principle stations on the route were Hamilton, Caledonia, Hagersville, Jarvis and Port Dover. Smaller stations were located in Rymal, Glanford and Garnet. Three of these stations survive. Caledonia station, the third to be built in the town, remains in use as a Grand Trunk Railway Museum and various local offices. Jarvis station, built in 1906 taking over both the Canada Air Line Railway station and the original H&NW; station, is now a commercial space. Garnet was moved and is now used as a storage shed. Like many railways that were abandoned in the late 20th century, the eastern sections of the line are now used for rail trail use as the Escarpment Rail Trail, part of the Trans-Canada Trail. The western sections, abandoned much earlier, have largely disappeared under modern agricultural fields, while some sections form the basis for modern roads in Port Dover, like Donjon Road and Grand Street. Its final terminus in town is now a marina and any trace of the connection at Bridge Street is gone.

He had a long career in the film industry, including many James Bond films, and was part of the sound team that won the Academy Award for Best Sound and the BAFTA Award for Best Sound for Star Wars. Career Ken Nightingall was born in 1928. Over his career, he worked on over 47 films. Among these are the James Bond films For Your Eyes Only (1981), Octopussy (1983), A View to a Kill (1985) and The Living Daylights (1987), as well as other popular films like Alfie (1966), Funeral in Berlin (1966), The Boys from Brazil (1978) and Supergirl (1984). He also worked in television, for shows such as Top Secret. His career began in generally low-budget British films, including The Deadly Bees, which went on to become a classic Mystery Science Theater 3000 parody. In his early works he was normally uncredited, but built a steady reputation for being a consistently high-quality boom operator. The A.V. Club says this reputation is likely how he was noticed by director George Lucas when Lucas was forming his Star Wars crew. He recorded sound on set for Star Wars (1977), which won the Academy Award for Best Sound and BAFTA Award for Best Sound; he was not named in the award citations and his work was uncredited. However, he was included when the Academy Award winners were invited to a celebratory lunch with the British royal family at Buckingham Palace. His first film was Paranoiac in 1963, and his last credited work was Lost in Space in 1998. He retired in the early 2000s. =Pink Shorts Boom Guy= Nightingall (center right in pink shorts) on the set of Star Wars in Tunisia. The original Reddit caption was: \\"Next time you watch Star Wars, I need you to remind yourself that all the dialogue you hear was recorded by a man in pink short shorts\\". The nickname \\"Pink Shorts Boom Guy\\" was applied to Nightingall in 2015. A photograph that had been taken during the filming of Star Wars in 1976 was published on Reddit and subsequently became popular on the internet due to its depiction of Nightingall, working as a boom operator, dressed only in pink shorts. The photograph was taken in Tunisia where the crew was shooting scenes of Tatooine with actors Alec Guinness and Mark Hamill. Nightingall explained that Tunisia was very hot and so he chose to dress in only shorts. Roger Christian, who worked on the film's production design, agreed that \\"the heat was more than enough to warrant pink shorts\\". He developed cult status among Star Wars and film fans because of the unusual choice. The outfit quickly inspired comic con costumes, as well as receiving merchandise based on Nightingall in custom Star Wars action figures and Lego minifigures. A guide to making a Pink Shorts Boom Guy costume was created by 2019, indicating that the pink shorts should be made of terry towelling, with a Facebook group also set up for ideas on alternatives to a real boom pole. Death Nightingall died at his home near London on 19 May 2020 at the age of 92. He is survived by his wife and two children. His son, Terence, also works in the film industry. His death was announced on 21 May by the Association of Motion Picture Sound, and came in the same week as the death of Star Wars publicist Charles Lippincott and the 40th anniversary of the release of The Empire Strikes Back. Clayton Sandell, who interviewed Nightingall and his son in 2019, tweeted that he had died of COVID-19. Multi-Oscar-winning sound engineer Chris Munro led the tributes to Nightingall; he wrote: \\"I first met Ken when I entered the industry over 50 years ago. He was immensely supportive of me as I carved my early career as a young sound mixer. 'Legend' is the word that springs to mind when I try to describe him. He will be sadly missed by our film community but his is a life and career that should be celebrated.\\" NotesReferencesExternal links * *Ken Nightingall at BFI Category:1928 births Category:2020 deaths Category:British audio engineers Category:Deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic in England Category:Date of birth missing ","title":"Ken Nightingall"},{"id":"64035002","text":"Batovka () is a rural locality (a khutor) in Pervomayskoye Rural Settlement, Bogucharsky District, Voronezh Oblast, Russia.

It is based on children's book of the same name by Yuri Yakovlev, who also wrote the screenplay for the film. Umka means \\"polar bear\\" in Chukchi language. The film is famous for its song \\"She-bear's Lullaby\\" (Russian: –ö–æ–ª—ã–±–µ–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –º–µ–¥–≤–µ–¥–∏—Ü—ã), written by Yevgeny Krylatov and performed by Aida Vedishcheva.  Plot  One night, a female polar bear teaches her cub Umka how to build a den in the snow. When she puts him to sleep, he asks her to tell a tale about the fish. The tale is about a sad Fish-Sun who cannot escape from shark's teeth. After the tale, Umka asks if their Sun was eaten by a shark too, which mother denies, since the Sun is not a fish and swims above them. She puts him to sleep, telling him that when he'll wake up, the Sun will appear. She then sings him a lullaby to help him fall asleep. The next morning, Umka notices a small camp of human reindeer herders, and when he asks about them, the mother explains that they're \\"bears who constantly walk on hind legs and can take off their skin\\". When Umka tries to walk on hind legs too, she tells him that they smell of smoke, sending him instead to catch a fish from an ice hole. When he tries to, he can't find any fish. Mother explains that it's because of his nose: while he's white, his nose is black, and that's what's blowing his cover. She advises him to cover it with his paw. Umka then wonders if the two-legged bears cover their noses too. One day, Umka encounters a small Chukchi boy who has just fallen off a reindeer while riding. When he sniffs him, he finds out that he smells like milk instead of smoke. When he asks him about his absence of tail, the amused boy puts a snowball on Umka's snout for fun, before running off, throwing his cap into the air. This causes Umka to think that he has two heads. Another day, as Umka runs after some reindeer, he meets the same boy again. After asking him about his \\"second head\\" and other missing bear features, they then decide to go to the sea. While Umka dives in, the boy stays on land, since the water is too cold for him. Suddenly, the mother calls for Umka, approaching them. To avoid trouble, Umka tells the boy to lie down in snow and cover his nose with his paw, although the boy crawls away right as mother arrives. When she senses the smell of smoke, Umka distracts her by pretending to spot a fish in a far ice hole, prompting mother to go and catch it. As Umka returns, he discovers that the boy has disappeared, leaving behind his cap. Umka takes the cap and runs to find his friend, only to discover people leaving along with the boy. Umka, sad that his friend is gone, asks his mother to relocate somewhere else; she complies. As they set off on an ice floe, the mother sings the second part of the lullaby. Later that night, someplace else, the boy gazes at the stars and sees Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, with latter imagining as his friend Umka waving at him. The film ends as the boy calls out for Umka.

He was one of the first players from his country to have enjoyed success on the international circuit and was known as the \\"father of Brazilian golf\\". As an amateur, Gonzalez has a great deal of success and built a reputation around the world. He won the Brazil Amateur Championship nine times, the Brazil Open twice, the Argentine Open in 1941, and the Spanish Open in 1947. He also played in several tournaments and matches in the United States; in 1941 he finished in a tie for sixth place in Chicago Open and tied a match with Bobby Jones. He had one other top-ten finish in a PGA Tour event, which came at the 1946 Pensacola Open. In the 1948 Open Championship he was near the top of the leaderboard before a poor final round saw him finish 11th, which was still enough to tie for low amateur honours. After turning professional in 1949, he became the head professional at G√°vea Golf and Country Club in Rio de Janeiro, where he remained until 1984. Although he did not pursue a playing career, he won many more tournaments including the Brazil Open a further 6 times and a second Argentine Open in 1953. He also represented Brazil in the Canada Cup, on sixteen occasions. In 1961 he was asked to appear in the first edition of Shell's Wonderful World of Golf; in the match held at G√°vea, he beat Billy Casper by three strokes. Gonzalez played in few international tournaments as a professional. However he did occasionally play in the major championships, recording best finishes of tied for 33rd in the 1956 Open Championship and tied for 48th in the 1962 Masters Tournament. In 2006 he was recognised by being awarded the honour of Officer of the Order of Rio Branco. Personal Gonzalez was born in Santana do Livramento. His father Jos√© Maria, was a teaching professional and course designer. His younger brother Jos√© Maria Gonzalez Filho was also an accomplished golfer, winning the Brazilian Amateur four times, and his son Jaime Gonzalez has enjoyed a successful career playing on both the European Tour and PGA Tour.

Early life  Hanomag's emergency money (Notgeld) from 1916 with signatures of father Gustav ter Meer, and railway engineer Erich Metzeltin Ilse ter Meer was born on 14 October 1899 in Hanover. Her parents were engineer Gustav ter Meer (b. July 15, 1860 one of 12 children of Edmund and Marie ter Meer) and Paula (n√©e Behrens), daughter of a canvas manufacturer from Einbeck. Her paternal grandparents owned a jam factory in Klein-Heubach. Ilse had two younger sibilings, a sister, Anneliese, and a brother, Hans. Through her father, engineer Gustav ter Meer, Ilse ter Meer developed an interest in steam engines, cars and technology. He gave her a steam engine to play with as a child.  Education  She completed her Abitur (secondary school education) at the Realgymnasium in Hanover (usually only attended by boys) and then studied mechanical engineering from 1919 to 1922 at the Technical University of Hanover and from 1922 to 1924 at the Technical University of Munich. Many male students objected to a woman student in the lecture halls and made their displeasure clear by stomping and whistling. But there were also fellow students who protected her against verbal harassment. In 1924 Ilse ter Meer (with one other female student, Wilhelmine Vogler) completed her mechanical engineering degree at the Technical University of Munich. She wrote an article for the VDI News on road testing a Hanomag car with her sister, probably the Hanomag 2/10 PS.  Career  In 1925 Ilse ter Meer married the electrical engineer Carl Knott, becoming known as Ilse Knott- ter Meer and the couple moved to Aachen, where she ran her own office. She represented the patents on centrifugal wastewater treatment machines that her engineer father, Gustav ter Meer, had developed as a director at Hanomag. The same year Knott-ter Meer became the first female member of the Verein Deutscher Ingenieure (VDI), the Association of German Engineers. During this time she worked as a freelancer and accompanied her husband on trips. In 1929 she joined the British Women's Engineering Society (WES), at the time the only women's engineering organisation in the world. The next year she wrote an article on Sanitary Engineering and the part it plays in maintaining heath in towns and cities for The Woman Engineer journal. In 1930, she was elected to the WES Council to represent German women engineers, at the same time that Elsa Gardner became the representative for America. In the 1930s, Knott-ter Meer worked at Siemens & Halske in Berlin, and gave birth to two sons (one in 1932 and the second in 1935). During the World Power Conference in Berlin in 1930, she organised the first ever formal meeting of German female engineers in conjunction with fellow engineer K√§the B√∂hm at which Caroline Haslett spoke about the Women's Engineering Society and the Electrical Association for Women, British organisations keen to build international links to benefit women through engineering and technology. Leading American engineer Kate Gleeson also attended the meeting. By 1933, there were as many as 618 female mechanics and engineers registered in Germany. For some women engineers, such as fellow WES members Asta Hampe and Ira Rischowski, the changes in the political landscape as the Nazi party came to power meant that their careers were badly affected, as some women and those with Jewish heritage were sacked from their jobs. During this period the VDI became heavily Nazified. Knott-ter Meer continued to work at Siemens & Halske through the Nazi era. Details about her work during this time are sketchy. In 1950, Knott-ter Meer was living in Nurenburg. From 1956 she was a member of the advisory board of the VDI specialist group VDI-Fachgruppe Haustechnik (a committee on domestic technology) and headed the office of the general agency of a US electrical appliance manufacturer. In 1960 she was one of the six founders of Frauen im Ingenieurberuf, the women's arm of the VDI. In 1964, she represented the Federal Republic of Germany in the first International Conference of Women Engineers (ICWES) in New York, and attended the second conference in held in Cambridge in 1967. At the VDI, she gave lectures on household technology and worked on the REFA (the Association for Work Studies and Business) committee on housekeeping.  Awards  In 1975, Knott-ter Meer was awarded the VDI gold medal for 50 years‚Äô of membership, alongside her husband Carl Knott. They were the first married couple to receive the awards. In June 1983, She attended the Women's Engineering Society's AGM and was awarded Honorary Membership of the organisation, alongside aeronautical engineer Beatrice Shilling and metallurgist Sir Monty Finneston.  Retirement and death  In 1987 her husband Carl Knott died after 62 years of marriage. She spent her last years in the Rupertihof residential complex in Rottach-Egern, where in her nineties she kept up to date on electrical engineering and electronics through specialist magazines. She died in Rottach-Egern on 3 November 1996. Her urn was buried alongside her husband on 18 November 1996.

As a direct consequence, it is now widely considered that linear congruential generators are weak for the purpose of generating random numbers. Particularly, it is inadvisable to use them for simulations with the Monte Carlo method or in cryptographic settings, such as issuing a public key certificate, unless specific numerical requirements are satisfied. Poorly chosen values for the modulus and multiplier in a Lehmer random number generator will lead to a short period for the sequence of random numbers. Marsaglia's result may be further extended to a mixed linear congruential generator. Main statement Consider a Lehmer random number generator with : r_{i+1} \\\\equiv kr_i\\\\mod m for any modulus m and multiplier k where each 0< r_i < m , and define a sequence : u_1 = \\\\frac{r_1} m, u_2 = \\\\frac{r_2} m, u_3 = \\\\frac{r_3} m , \\\\ldots Define the points : \\\\pi_1 = (u_1, \\\\ldots, u_n), \\\\pi_2 = (u_2, \\\\ldots, u_{n+1}), \\\\pi_3 = (u_3, \\\\ldots, u_{n+2}), \\\\ldots on a unit n-cube formed from successive terms of the sequence of u. With such a multiplicative number generator, all n-tuples of resulting random numbers lie in at most (n!m)^{1/n} hyperplanes. Additionally, for a choice of constants c_1,c_2, \\\\ldots, c_n which satisfy the congruence : c_1 + c_2k+c_3k^2 + \\\\cdots + c_n k^{n-1} \\\\equiv 0 \\\\mod m, there are at most c_1 + c_2 + \\\\cdots + c_n parallel hyperplanes which contain all n-tuples produced by the generator. Proofs for these claims may be found in Marsaglia's original paper.

Her parents were Walter and Jane MacLellan. She joined in FANY in 1929 which was a volunteer organisation principally active in wartime. The FANY was led by Mary Baxter Ellis from 1932 who had led the FANY in Northumberland taking over from Lilian Franklin OBE.

This was a role that Mary Baxter Ellis had turned down, but she agreed however to supply 1500 women to serve with the ATS as long as they could be independent. This was agreed, but Gwynne-Vaughan broke the agreement, and forced the FANY staff to be absorbed. Gwynne-Vaughan held the role to 1941. MacLellan was placed in a difficult position but she opted to join the ATS and lead the 4th Scottish motor company from November 1938.

Early life and education  Mohabir was born in London. Soon after, his family moved to Toronto, and then to Chuluota, Florida, where he spent most of his formative years. In Queens, New York, he taught ESL as community empowerment for immigrants. \\"It was also disheartening to know all the obstacles they had to deal with in order to make something of themselves,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI had been there myself.‚Äù When he lived in New York, he produced the nationally broadcast radio show KAVIhouse on JusPunjabi.

Mohabir received his MFA in Poetry and Translation from Queens College, CUNY. He has a PhD in English from the University of Hawai\`i. He was formerly an Assistant Professor of Poetry at Auburn University. About his bevy of learned disciplines, Mohabir said in an interview with Kundiman, > \\"I have never thought of these things as disconnected‚Äîin fact the music I > came to poetry from was religious/cultural. I wonder if it‚Äôs the academy > that tries to separate them. I see a connection in things poetic as far as > my community is concerned.

The Rumpus said: \\"Mohabir‚Äôs The Taxidermist‚Äôs Cut is a collection of destruction and reconstruction, and we the readers are left among the moonlit ruins, with a strange ache of recognition.\\" Publisher's Weekly said: \\"In his excellent debut, Mohabir exposes desire and inner turmoil through the measured incantations of a queer, Indian-American voice that refuses the burdens of a homophobic and racist world.\\" In a starred review for The Cowherd's Son, Publisher's Weekly said: \\"Mohabir continues to demonstrate an uncanny ability to compose exacting, tactile poems that musically leap off the page...Mohabir offers much to appreciate, and even among the strife he records, there is a yearning for and pursuit of joy.\\" The Los Angeles Review of Books said, \\"The Cowherd‚Äôs Son is an impressive collection marked by honest vulnerability. It humbly displays a harrowed family history and the ensuing feeling of being an outlier. Struggles with homophobia, racism, violence, and xenophobia all serve to help the speaker achieve a deeper sense of self-acceptance. Ultimately, The Cowherd‚Äôs Son enlists darkness to empower the potential for goodness.\\" Gulf Stream said, \\"Throughout the collection there are profound scenes where Mohabir lets us into the speaker‚Äôs mouth, the speaker‚Äôs bed, where we can see how much the weight of heritage affects his intimate life. This tension between epic gesture and private stillness pushes the collection forward and transcends setting, making The Cowherd‚Äôs Son an incredible symphony of movement and place, where identity is constantly redefined and reimagined in the context of historical memory.\\" Mohabir often includes Bhojpuri or Hindi in his poems. In an interview with The Rumpus, he said: > \\"When I was an MFA student, a classmate suggested I remove all Hindi words, > place names, and familial relationships because he (a cis white man) could > not understand the poem. Sunu Chandy, another classmate, spoke up and said, > 'These are real people and real places.

Description Dave Arneson created a new type of game in 1970, something he called \\"Blackmoor\\". After he demonstrated his game to Gary Gygax in 1972, Gygax proposed that the two of them work together to codify a set of rules for a new game, which subsequently became Dungeons & Dragons. Gygax also founded TSR in order to publish the original set of rules in 1974. The following year, TSR published Blackmoor, which outlined supplemental rules for D&D; and included Arneson's sample adventure \\"Temple of the Frog\\"; however, despite its title, Blackmoor contained very little information about Arneson's Blackmoor campaign world. Arneson came to work at TSR in 1976 as Director of Research, but he and Gygax had very different visions of role-playing, and the creative differences between the two proved irreconcilable. Arneson left TSR at the end of 1976, and immediately started working to produce role-playing material. One was the self-published Dungeonmaster‚Äôs Index (1977); the other was The First Fantasy Campaign, a book published by Judges Guild in which Arneson described details of his world of Blackmoor. Despite the cover, which stated the book was 88 pages, it was actually a 96-page book, with illustrations by Pixie Bledsaw, Ken Simpson and Arneson, and two large maps drawn by Arneson. The book includes: * A listing of the various armies in Blackmoor, and summaries of kingdom management, including road construction, building ships, the costs of exploration, farming, etc. As game historian James Maliszewksi noted, the book is \\"a fascinating reminder that D&D;'s roots are in wargaming and not just in a vague 'it's about killing bad guys and taking their stuff' sort of way. As presented in this book, Blackmoor was at least in part an honest-to-goodness exercise in strategy and tactics by the players, as the armies of good and evil contended to determine the fate of the northern provinces of the Great Kingdom.\\" * \\"Blackmoor's More Infamous Characters\\", both heroes and villains * Details and a map of the village of Blackmoor, including the home of Mello the Halfling and the tower of Svenson's Freehold * The baronies and villages of the surrounding region * The upper works of Blackmoor Castle, as well as the first ten levels of the dungeons beneath the castle. (The book states there are at least 15 more levels, although these were never published) * Four levels of dungeons under a ruin called Glendower. * A collection of various unrelated pieces, including ** a list of magic swords ** the use of magic in Blackmoor ** earning experience points ** several more maps ** expanded rules for other monster such as dragons and vampires. ** alternate rules and guidelines for play with miniatures. In his 2014 book Designers & Dragons, Shannon Appelcline commented, \\"Amidst rules and army listings, readers learned some facts about the Kingdom, received information on some notable personalities, and got a look at Blackmoor Town, Blackmoor Castle, and Blackmoor Dungeon. There were also some maps of more distant lands, which would have to be enough to keep players content for several years.\\" James Maliszewksi pointed out that there's no actual set of rules for how to play in Blackmoor, saying, \\"for all this information, it's unclear what rules set Dave and his players used to adjudicate these battles. One assumes Chainmail but that's not a certainty.\\" Publication history The book was published by Judges Guild in 1977, and went through three printings. However, this was the last work by Arneson that Judges Guild produced. Reception In the October- November 1977 issue of White Dwarf (Issue #3), Don Turnbull gave a strong recommendation to this book, saying, \\"To designers of outdoor adventure universes, this is a must. Time has not permitted me to study every detail, but the booklet is brimful of ideas ranging from farm management to the cost and labour of building roads.\\" Shannon Appelcline commented that \\"The First Fantasy Campaign (1977) was written by none other than Dave Arneson. It was written as part of his attempt to get back into the RPG business following his departure from TSR ‚Äî a brief renaissance where he also worked with Heritage Models to produce the Dungeonmaster‚Äôs Index (1977). Not only did The First Fantasy Campaign offer a new fantasy campaign setting, but the setting was Dave Arneson's Blackmoor. Unfortunately, Blackmoor wasn't quite presented as its own world, because it connected to the Wilderlands along one map edge ‚Äî a theme that would continue through all of Blackmoor's appearances for the next 25 years. Sadly, Arneson and Judges Guild never released anything beyond this first book.\\" RPG Geek notes that \\"Although fascinating for anyone with an interest in the history of the RPG hobby, the First Fantasy Campaign supplement is very loosely organized and may disappoint readers who are hoping for a fully fleshed out campaign setting.\\" References Category:Judges Guild fantasy role-playing game supplements ","title":"The First Fantasy Campaign"},{"id":"64035858","text":"Drumheller-Gleichen was a provincial electoral district in Alberta, Canada, mandated to return a single member to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta using the first-past-the-post method of voting from 1963 to 1971.

She has been featured in various photoshoots. She made her film debut in Chaudhry, directed by Azeem Sajjad. She was one of the passengers who died aboard PIA Flight 8303, which crashed in Karachi, Pakistan, on 22 May 2020. Personal life Zara Abid was born on 4 April in Lahore, Punjab. She grew up and resided in Karachi with her family and completed her schooling at St. Patrick's Girls High School, before graduating with a bachelor's degree and going into show business. Modeling career As a fashion icon, she was known for her tall height and tanned complexion, which made her stand out in an industry dominated by lighter-skin models. According to Abid, when she started modeling, she faced discrimination in being hired, allegedly due to her looks and skin colour. However, she stated she worked her way up and received opportunities on the basis of her professional skills and talent. She was described as \\"stunning and utterly unapologetic\\" about her color. According to a makeup artist who worked with her, Abid embodied the \\"dusky skin colour\\" of the majority of Pakistani women, and one of her makeup campaigns became a bestseller because it captured that. One of her photoshoots by a salon for the magazine Hello Mag in 2019,; in which she was styled with a skin tone many shades darker than her own, evoked controversy for allegedly promoting \\"blackface\\" and cultural misappropriation, and was perceived by critics as racist. Abid had shared the pictures on her personal Instagram account. The posts were noted to have received backlash and trolling. Abid defended her photoshoot, stating the point was to empower darker-skinned women and send a message on their lack of representation; she also called out the \\"colourism\\" that allegedly existed in society, questioning why she was being criticised for adopting a dark profile when in numerous other photoshoots, she had been purposefully presented in lighter tones. The designer brands for which she had modeled include Sana Safinaz, Wajahat Mansoor, Annus Abrar, Zaheer Abbas, Deepak and Fahad, Payal Keyal, Alkaram, Gul Ahmed, Kayseria, Dhanak, Rang Ja, Generation, Republic Women's Wear, and Hussain Rehar. She appeared in television commercials, such as for Zong 4G. Film and television Abid began her acting career with her debut role in the upcoming film Chaudhry, directed by Azeem Sajjad and written by Zeeshan Junaid. The film is a biopic about slain police officer Chaudhry Aslam Khan, in which Abid plays a college student. Talking about her role in an interview, Abid said it was very much relatable to her real-life persona, adding that \\"the character is really strong and I didn‚Äôt think twice before saying yes. The script was narrated to me over the phone and I immediately agreed.\\" She began shooting for the film in December 2018. The film is expected to be released in 2020. On 16 January 2019, she appeared as a guest on the late night television comedy show Mazaaq Raat. On 24 May 2020, her first and only short film Sikka was uploaded to YouTube two days after her death as a tribute. Abid portrays two female characters whose lives are polar opposites in terms of wealth and social status; yet, despite never crossing paths and living very differently, they share similar trials and struggles as women in society. The film does not have dialogue and is narrated in third person by Saba Qamar. Death On 22 May 2020, Abid was amongst the passengers of the PIA Flight 8303, which crashed while on final approach for landing near the Jinnah International Airport in Karachi; she was said to be returning to the city after attending her uncle's funeral in Lahore. A flight manifest released by PIA showed her name on the list of passengers. Ninety-seven deaths were reported from the 99 people on board, and she was not reported as one of the survivors. She had been modeling for clothing brand Sana Safinaz at the time when she had to reportedly leave for Lahore. Some initial reports claimed she had survived the accident. After the crash, Abid's brother told the media that her family were still looking for her at the hospital where the injured were admitted, and that they were waiting for an update from authorities. Her brother appealed to stop the spread of fake news regarding the matter. Tributes started to appear on social media as soon as news of the plane accident broke.; Many celebrities from the fashion and entertainment industries expressed their condolences when her death was confirmed. Abid was also the target of online abuse from many people for what she used to wear and her lifestyle choices, leading to her accounts on social media platforms being deactivated. Awards and nominations In January 2020, Abid won an award in the category of \\"Best Female Model\\" at the 4th Hum Style Awards. She was also named in the \\"Top 100 People\\" list by Hello! magazine's Pakistan edition.

Cover art, 1976 Setting An evil wizard has stolen an important talisman, and has hidden it somewhere in his six-level stronghold, the Citadel, which is guarded by minions. The Forces of Good send heroes into the Citadel to try and find the Talisman and escape with it. Citadel was one of the first board games with modular play areas. Description Citadel is a two-player board game designed by Roy Goodman and published by Fantasy Games Unlimited. The entire game is enclosed in a 14-page rulebook, which includes * six double-sided 11\\" x 8\\" cardboard map sheets. Each map is marked with a 5 x 5 grid with pre-printed corridors and rooms * several cardboard sheets of counters The game is divided into three phases: Set-up, Search, and Escape. Set-up One player chooses to be the Evil Wizard, and the other player represents the Forces of Good. The two players first agree on how many points they can spend on their respective sides. Reviewer Mike Westhead suggested that 350‚Äì450 points results in a two-hour game. =Evil set-up= Maps: The player playing the Evil Wizard first chooses six of the mapsheets ‚Äî either the front or back of each of the six map sheets ‚Äî which will represent the six levels of the Citadel. Talisman: On one of the maps, the player places the Talisman counter face-down. Monsters: The player then allocates the agreed-upon points to his minions, choosing from a pool of 25-point humans, 35-point near-humans, 40-point monsters, and if desired, a single 50-point monster. Each one starts with 6 wound points, except the 50-point monster, which has 8 wound points. The chosen monsters are also placed on various places in the Citadel facedown. Traps: The player can also place up to two sinkholes (10 points each), and up to three pitfalls (5 points each). The player cannot place the Talisman behind an impassable sinkhole, and must place minions and obstacles so that they are accessible from every square on that level without having to pass through another marker. Doorways: The player must also place at least two entrance doorways and two exit doorways on each level. Doorways can be either one-way or two-way. On one of the levels, the player places the Main Entrance, where the Heroes will enter the Citadel. All markers except for the Main Entrance are placed facedown. =Good set- up= The player playing the Forces of Good must choose a group of heroes from counters that vary from 25‚Äì40 points. The player can also have one 50-point hero. Each hero starts with 6 wound points, except the 50-point hero, which has 8 wound points. Search In the second phase, the Good player sends up to three Heroes into the Main Entrance of the Citadel. If a hero ends their turn adjacent to a marker, and the Good player wants to search that square, the Evil player turns over the marker to reveal what it is, unless it is a one-way Exit marker leading into that level, in which case it remains facedown. * Exit doorway allowing access to another level: The hero moves to the corresponding Entrance marker on the new level. * Sinkhole or pitfall: The hero takes damage from the trap * Monster: Combat ensues On subsequent turns, the Good player can send more heroes in through the Main Entrance to bolster the original three or to replace heroes who died in traps or via combat, but there can never be more than five heroes in the Citadel at a time. =Combat= The attacker adds the target's strength to 60, then subtracts the attacker's combat strength, resulting in a target sum. The attacker then rolls percentile dice. For every 20 points the die roll exceeds the target sum, the target suffers a loss of one wound point. If the target loses half of its original wound points, its combat strength is reduced to half. A counter reduced to zero wound points is killed Escape Once a hero discovers the Talisman, the Forces of Good must then successfully retrace their steps to the Main Entrance and escape. Victory Conditions If the Good player succeeds in moving the Talisman through the main entrance, Good prevails. If the Good player runs out of heroes before the Talisman reaches the Main Entrance, then the Evil player wins. Reception In the October-November 1977 edition of White Dwarf (Issue #3), Mike Westhead found the game to be original, a good value, and was impressed by the new combat system. However, Westhead thought the game was skewed in favour of the Evil player. He also was not impressed that the game did not supply the required ten-sided dice or any miniature figures, and thought that there was too much math needed for combat. He concluded, \\"But all in all, Citadel is a simple, well-presented and enjoyable fantasy game\\" and gave it an average rating of 7 out of 10.

Organized on 17 June 1861 as Company G, 19th Illinois Infantry Regiment, it was detached as an independent artillery battery on 14 January 1863. The battery fought in the Tullahoma campaign, at the battles of Chickamauga and Missionary Ridge, and in the Knoxville campaign in 1863. Bridges' Battery participated in the Atlanta campaign in 1864, fighting at Rocky Face Ridge, Resaca, Adairsville, Pickett's Mill, Kennesaw Mountain, Peachtree Creek, Atlanta, and Jonesboro. The unit fought at Franklin and Nashville shortly before it was renamed Battery \\"B\\", 1st Illinois Light Artillery Regiment on 21 December 1864. It spent the rest of the war with the Nashville garrison and was mustered out in July 1865. History1863 Formation= The unit which became Bridges' Battery Illinois Light Artillery mustered into Federal service as Company G, 19th Illinois Infantry Regiment on 17 June 1861. Company G shared in the experiences of the 19th Illinois Infantry until September 1862, when it was fitted out as an artillery battery at Nashville, Tennessee. The unit was at Nashville from 12 September through 7 November 1862, when it marched to Gallatin, Tennessee. On 20 November, the company turned in its artillery equipment and returned to Nashville. Company G marched from Nashville to join its parent regiment at Murfreesboro, Tennessee on 2 January 1863. It is not clear whether it went into action at the Battle of Stones River on that date. On 14 January 1863, Company G was permanently detached as Bridges' Battery Illinois Light Artillery and equipped at Nashville. By 20 February, the new artillery battery returned to the Army of the Cumberland at Murfreesboro and was attached to the Pioneer Brigade. It remained at Murfreesboro until June 1863. At that time the battery was reassigned to the 1st Brigade, 2nd Division, XIV Corps. Captain Lyman Bridges of Chicago assumed command of the battery. William Bishop of Springfield and Morris D. Temple of Chicago were first lieutenants, while Lyman A. White and Franklin Seborn of Chicago were second lieutenants. On 1 July 1863, White was promoted first lieutenant. The battery participated in the Tullahoma campaign from 23 June to 7 July 1863. When Bridges' Battery reported from Manchester, Tennessee, its armament consisted of two M1841 6-pounder field guns, two M1841 12-pounder howitzers, and two 3-inch Ordnance rifles. The unit reported having the following smoothbore ammunition: 195 round shot, 266 spherical case shot, and 122 canister shot for 6-pounder guns, and 50 common shell and 350 spherical case shot for 12-pounder howitzers. It also reported having 100 round shot, 250 spherical case shot, and 50 canister for 12-pounder field guns, but this may be an error. The battery also reported having the following 3-inch rifled ammunition: 105 bullet shell, 65 percussion shell, 250 fuse shell, and 84 canister shot. =1863 Chickamauga= At the Battle of Chickamauga on 19‚Äì20 September 1863, Bridges' Battery was attached to John Beatty's 1st Brigade, James S. Negley's 2nd Division, in the XIV Corps under George Henry Thomas. By this date, the battery had been rearmed with two 12-pounder Napoleons and four 3-inch Ordnance rifles. On 20 September, Thomas, commanding the Union left wing, asked for Negley's division to fill a gap on his extreme left flank. There was some confusion and only John Beatty's brigade could be sent at first. When Beatty arrived at 8:00 am, Thomas directed him to form on the left of Absalom Baird's division. Beatty deployed his brigade across the Lafayette Road, facing north, on Baird's left, with Bridges' Battery near the road. Soon afterward, a staff officer directed Beatty to move his brigade north. Beatty argued against the move to no avail; the staff officer insisted that the order was imperative. Baird watched with dismay as his flank support marched away, just as a Confederate attack seemed imminent. As Beatty's brigade moved north, it was struck by two and a half Confederate brigades. Captain Bridges split his battery into two 3-gun sections with Lieutenant Bishop in charge of the right section on the east side of the road and Bridges leading the left section on the west side. At first, Bridges' section moved north, but it soon returned to its original location. Bridges reported opening fire on Confederate infantry at 9:30 am with case shot at and canister as the range decreased. As Union infantry fled through the battery, Beatty ordered Bridges to retreat. By this time, so many horses and men were casualties, that two of the guns had to be abandoned. Bishop was killed while trying to save his guns from capture. Some men from the 104th Illinois Infantry Regiment helped save one of Bishop's guns but the other two were lost. Confederate Lieutenant Lot Young of the 4th Kentucky Infantry watched in astonishment as Captain Bridges rode his horse into full view and lifted his hat to his enemies. Despite being the target of 50 riflemen, Bridges trotted away unscathed. As Thomas, Beatty, and other officers tried to save the left from collapse, Bridges sent his four remaining guns back to Snodgrass Hill under Lieutenant Temple. Negley placed the battery facing southeast toward the Dyer field alongside Battery M, 1st Ohio Light Artillery. Later, Negley ordered all of his batteries off the field, though the battle still raged. Bridges' Battery lost six killed, 20 wounded, and four missing out of 126 officers and men at Chickamauga. The battery also lost 46 horses, one Napoleon, one Ordnance rifle, three limbers, and one caisson. Bridges' Battery dragged four abandoned guns from other batteries off the field. In its 3rd Quarter 1863 report, Bridges' Battery reported having the following 12-pounder Napoleon ammunition: four solid shot, 148 common shell, 34 case shot, and no canister shot. For the 3-inch Ordnance rifles there were 130 percussion shell, 186 fuse shell, 163 bullet shell, and 66 canister shot. The battery's small arms included 10 Remington Army revolvers, 15 cavalry sabers, and five horse artillery sabers. After the death of Lieutenant Bishop, Seborn was promoted first lieutenant and William R. Bise of Canton, Missouri was promoted second lieutenant. =1863 Chattanooga= During the Chattanooga campaign, Bridges' Battery was attached to Thomas J. Wood's 3rd Division of Gordon Granger's IV Corps. After Wood's division captured Orchard Knob on 23 November 1863, General Thomas immediately ordered Bridges' Battery forward to occupy the seized hill. In the Battle of Missionary Ridge on 25 November, Ulysses S. Grant ordered Thomas to attack the Confederate rifle pits at the base of the ridge. Thomas relayed the order to Granger, who was totally absorbed in aiming the guns of Bridges' Battery. After Grant repeated the order, Granger came to his senses and instructed his division commanders Wood and Philip Sheridan to attack when a battery fired six shots in rapid succession. As noted on the historical marker at the Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park, Bridges' Battery fired the six signal shots to begin the attack about 3:30 pm. The battery was armed with two 12-pounder Napoleons and four 3-inch Ordnance rifles. After the soldiers stepped off, the battery \\"continued a rapid and annoying fire over the heads of the assaulting line of Union troops till the ridge was carried\\". The marker states that the battery reported no casualties. After pursuing as far as Graysville, Georgia, Bridges' Battery served in the Knoxville campaign. From 28 November to 8 December 1863, it marched to the relief of Knoxville. The battery participated in operations in East Tennessee through April 1864. This included a reconnaissance from Maryville, Tennessee on 1‚Äì2 February. In its 4th Quarter 1863 report, Bridges' Battery had two 12-pounder Napoleons and six 3-inch Ordnance rifles. The unit reported having the following 12-pounder Napoleon ammunition: 32 common shell and 17 canister shot. The 3-inch Ordnance rifle ammunition included 240 percussion shell, 262 fuse shell, 240 case shot, and 160 canister shot. =1864 Atlanta= Wash drawing by Alfred Waud shows Union artillery firing near Kennesaw Mountain. At the start of the Atlanta campaign, Bridges' Battery was assigned to Wood's 3rd Division in Oliver Otis Howard's IV Corps. In the report of Bridges' Battery at the end of the campaign, Lieutenant Lyman A. White noted that Bridges' Battery started the campaign on 5 May 1864 with six 3-inch Ordnance rifles under the command of Captain Bridges. The battery shelled the Confederate positions on 10 and 12 May during the Battle of Rocky Face Ridge. The battery was present but not engaged in the Battle of Resaca on 13 May. During the Battle of Adairsville the unit shelled the enemy at 5:00 pm on 17 May. At 6:00 pm on 18 May its raking fire helped disperse Confederate formations. On 22 May, General Howard appointed Captain Bridges the acting chief-of-artillery for IV Corps and Lieutenant Temple assumed command of Bridges' Battery. On 27 May 1864, Bridges' Battery fought in the Battle of Pickett's Mill while emplaced in field works. That day and on 28‚Äì30 May, the battery engaged two Confederate batteries that were distant. During the bombardment, the field works were completely smashed and had to be rebuilt by the artillerists. One of the opposing batteries was silenced. During the four days of fighting, the battery lost five men wounded (two severely), four horses killed, and two caisson wheels damaged. On 8 June, two enlisted men were captured by Confederate cavalry while foraging. Also on 8 June, Lieutenants Temple and Bise and 28 soldiers were ordered to return to Chicago because their enlistments expired. Lieutenant White assumed command of the battery. From 17 June to 3 July 1864, Bridges' Battery was continuously involved in the fighting leading up to and after the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain. The section led by Sergeant Luman C. Lawrence silenced a Confederate battery on 17‚Äì18 June. During an especially fierce bombardment on 21 June, Lieutenant Seborn and an enlisted man were wounded, and two horses killed and one wounded. On 22 June, one gun was disabled after being hit by a 12-pounder solid shot. On 6 July, fire from the battery prevented Confederates from removing a pontoon bridge spanning the Chattahoochee River. On 9 July an enlisted man was killed by a musket ball. The battery crossed the Chattahoochee with the IV Corps on 12 July. The unit took position on the north bank of Peachtree Creek on 19 July and the section led by Sergeant Clark E. Dodge received the compliments of General Thomas for its good shooting. The Battle of Peachtree Creek occurred on 20 July; on the following day the battery fired on the outer defenses of Atlanta and drove off some enemy skirmishers. During the Battle of Atlanta on 22 July 1864, Bridges' Battery unlimbered north-northeast of Atlanta and began shelling the Confederate defenses at 3:00 pm. Starting at 6:00 pm on 23 July and continuing for 26 hours, the battery bombarded the Atlanta defenses. For 12 hours, one gun was fired every three minutes, while the firing interval was increased to every five minutes for the next 14 hours. The guns fired almost every day until 12 August when the battery moved to a new position. From then until 25 August, firing was occasional. On 2 August Sergeants Dodge and Lawrence were both promoted to second lieutenant. The unit participated in the flank march from 25‚Äì30 August, ending in the Battle of Jonesborough on 1 September. During the campaign, the battery sustained personnel losses of two killed, six wounded, and four captured. Captain Bridges submitted a report on 9 September 1864 in his capacity as IV Corps chief-of-artillery. He listed the armament of Bridges' Battery as five 3-inch Ordnance rifles and noted that the battery expended 130 solid shot, 1,815 percussion shell, 1,212 fuse shell, 2,092 case shot, and 14 canister shot in the campaign. =1864 Franklin= Bridges' Battery is shown near Strickland's brigade in this Battle of Franklin map. Bridges' Battery participated in operations against John Bell Hood's Confederate army in northern Georgia from 29 September to 3 November 1864. The battery took part in the Franklin‚ÄìNashville Campaign starting on 24 November. In the Battle of Franklin on 30 November, Bridges' Battery was commanded by Lieutenant White and formed part of the IV Corps artillery reserve under Captain Bridges. The IV Corps was led by David S. Stanley. At first, the battery was placed in reserve of the center near the Columbia Pike. The center was threatened when Confederate attackers closely followed routed Union soldiers from George D. Wagner's division and seized the outer breastworks. Bridges' Battery and two others briefly held off the attackers until Emerson Opdycke's brigade plugged the gap. At first, Bridges' Battery tried to unlimber near the Carter house garden, but it quickly shifted position to the northwest of the Carter house. In this location, its guns helped the 111th Ohio Infantry defend its earthworks. Bridges' Battery and 1st Kentucky Battery were among the last artillery units to pull out, around midnight. After the battle, Captain Bridges reported that the battery sustained casualties of seven men wounded. Its four guns fired the following 3-inch ammunition: 113 percussion shell, 26 fuse shell, 171 case shot, and no canister shot. During the Battle of Nashville on 15‚Äì16 December 1864, Bridges' Battery led by Lieutenant White was assigned to the Post of Nashville under John F. Miller. No casualties were reported. On 21 December 1864, Bridges' Battery was renamed Battery \\"B\\", 1st Illinois Light Artillery Regiment. The battery spent the rest of the war with the Nashville garrison and mustered out of service on 6 July 1865. During its existence, Bridges' Battery suffered casualties of two officers and seven enlisted men killed, while 20 enlisted men died of disease. In 1869‚Äì1870, a monument to Bridges' Battery was erected at Rosehill Cemetery in Chicago and 26 soldiers were buried there.

Biography  Rachel Blodgett was born in Woburn, Massachusetts, the oldest of three children of Mabel Edith Owen (b. 1874) and William Edward Blodgett (b. 1864); neither of whom attended college.Green, Judy, and Jeanne LaDuke. Supplementary Material for Pioneering Women in American Mathematics: The Pre-1940 PhD's. American Mathematical Society, 2009. After graduating from Woburn High School in 1912, she entered Wellesley College and majored in mathematics and Latin. In addition to her studies, she joined the school's Shakespeare Society and performed cornet in the symphony orchestra. Academically, she was gifted and was named a Wellesley scholar in 1914 and a Durant scholar in 1915. She graduated with her bachelor's degree (B.A.) in 1916, after which Blodgett moved to Montreal, Quebec, Canada to teach math at Miss Edgar‚Äôs and Miss Cramp‚Äôs School until 1918 when she returned to Massachusetts. = Research = For the next three years, Blodgett pursued advanced analysis at Radcliffe College, where she received an Edward Austin scholarship for at least two years and a Mary E. Horton fellowship for her final year. She earned her master's degree (M.A.) in 1919, and continued on to acquire her Ph.D. in mathematics in 1921. The following fall term, Dr. Blodgett took a teaching position at Wellesley. Rachel Blodgett married Harvard-trained mathematician Clarence Raymond Adams (1898‚Äì1965) on August 17, 1922, in Eden Park, in Providence, Rhode Island. (He was widely known as \\"C.R. Adams.\\") At the time, C. R. Adams was a Sheldon traveling fellow from Harvard, which allowed the newly married couple to travel extensively overseas with stops in Rome and G√∂ttingen, Germany. Upon their return to the U.S. in 1923, the two mathematicians settled down in Providence, Rhode Island, where C. R. established his career at Brown University and eventually headed the math department there. Blodgett, now known as Dr. Rachel Adams, moved forward with her research for a few years, according to mathematician Judy Green, > \\"At least through the 1920s Adams continued her interest in integral > equations. G. C. Evans of Rice Institute used information from her > dissertation in an extensive review of a book on linear integral equations > for the Monthly in 1927. She presented her results to the AMS in 1926 and > published them in the American Journal in 1929.\\" Adams also spent many years tutoring math students at her Alma Mater Radcliffe College from 1926 to 1941, with her friend and colleague Mary Graustein, Ph.D., with the goal of encouraging young female students. During World War II, Adams registered with the National Roster of Scientific and Specialized Personnel in Washington, D.C. to help with the war effort, but confirmation of any contribution she may have made as part of that program has not yet been found. = Later years = During their marriage Rachel and C. R. Adams traveled extensively by automobile in the United States and Europe. The couple never had children. He died in 1965 at the age of 67. She was 87 when she died in Providence, January 22, 1982. She is buried at Swan Point Cemetery there.  Legacy  In her estate plans, Rachel bequeathed to Wellesley College the Blodgett Fund, and stipulated that the fund's income be used for scholarships.

It is found in submontane and montane regions within the Cameroon volcanic line (Mount Manengouba, Bamboutos Mountains, Mount Lefo, and Mount Oku) as well as the adjacent Obudu Plateau in the southeast of Nigeria. It is named after James (Jim) Zimkus by his wife, Breda Zimkus, the first author of the species description. Common name Jim Zimkus' puddle frog has been proposed for this species. Description Adult males measure and adult females in snout‚Äìvent length. The body shape is compact and the hind limbs are strong. The tympanum is indistinct or only scarcely visible; supratympanic fold is present. Fingers lack webbing and have small but distinct discs. Toes are moderately to extensively webbed and have small discs. Dorsal coloration varies from medium to dark brown. Coloration may appear uniform but typically includes some lighter and darker spots. Some individuals have a thick, light brown mid-dorsal stripe. Ventral coloration is similarly mottled in the pectoral and abdominal regions. Habitat and conservation Phrynobatrachus jimzimkusi occurs in calm, pool-like passages of rapid streams in montane forests, including stream-fringing forests in montane savanna, at elevations of above sea level. Furthermore, it can sometimes be found along streams in open grassland, especially at higher elevations, and can persist in very degraded habitats, even in those without canopy cover. Females attach clutches of eggs in small groups to root hairs or vegetation floating in the water column. The tadpoles live in pools in streams. This species seems to be diurnal. Once locally abundant, this species has declined in recent years. Although conclusive evidence is lacking, the decline is similar to that caused by chytridiomycosis for other montane amphibians. It is also highly threatened by agricultural pressure including cattle grazing, use of herbicides and pesticides, burning of montane grasslands, and harvesting for firewood, as well as by expanding human settlements. It is present in the Cross River National Park in Nigeria.

He was one of those credited with the initial development of the tank during the early part of the First World War. Although his design for an enormous wheeled vehicle proved to be impractical, it earned him a seat on the Landship Committee and he participated in early experiments with tracked vehicles. Early career Educated at Harrow School, Hetherington's interest in mechanics led him to a three year apprenticeship with the Maudslay Motor Company.Smithers 1987, p. 21 Commissioned into the 18th Hussars, Hetherington had represented both the army and Great Britain in equestrian competitions, until an accident left him unable to ride, whereupon he took up flying. Having earned the Royal Aero Club Aviator's Certificate No. 105 at Brooklands in July 1911, he transferred to No. 1 Company Air Battalion Royal Engineers which specialised in flying airships and was renamed No. 1 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps in May of the following year. In July 1914, he was seconded to the Royal Naval Air Service as an airship instructor. Following the outbreak of war, on 1 September Hetherington was appointed to No.3 Wing RNAS in Dunkirk as Transport Officer. The wing was commanded by the unconventional and aggressive Charles Rumney Samson, who had built from scratch a fleet of armoured cars which he used to harry the cavalry patrols of the German Army which was advancing into Belgium. Following the arrival of purpose-built armoured vehicles from the Admiralty, on 2 October Hetherington was given command of a section of five Wolseley armoured cars, representing one third of Samson's RNAS Armoured Car Section.Glanfield 2006, p. 43 Landship Committee By December 1914, Hetherington had moved to Wormwood Scrubs Naval Air Station in London, as Divisional Transport Officer for the armoured car formation which was being assembled there.Smithers 1987, p. 21 One of his engineer officers, Robert Francis Macfie, had been investigating the use of Holt tractors which ran on continuous tracks. When Macfie suggested that they be used to cross trenches on the battlefield, Hetherington joked that it would be better to \\"take a thing like the gasometer at the Oval, put on a couple of wheels like the Earl's Court Wheel, put your mechanism inside and put in some decent guns like 12-inch naval guns, then you can cross the Rhine\\". Although initially suggested in jest, Hetherington began work on a detailed design aided by his subordinates, which he submitted to his commanding officer, Murray Sueter, and became known as the \\"Hetherington Proposal\\". The three huge wheels were intended to be driven by electric motors using the power generated by submarine-type diesel engines. Including the 12-inch gun armament which weighed 47 tons, the total weight was calculated at 800 tons. Sueter persuaded Hetherington that this would be impossibly large, so a second design was produced, the \\"Revised Hetherington Proposal\\", this time of 300 tons, with three 40 foot diameter wheels and an armament of three twin turrets for 4-inch guns.Glanfield 2006, pp. 52-53 At the end of January 1915, Sueter forwarded this design to Winston Churchill, the First Lord of the Admiralty who was desperate to find a way to overcome the static trench warfare which had developed, despite the fact that this was not really naval business. Churchill forwarded the plan to Jackie Fisher, the first Sea Lord, who passed them on to his gunnery expert, Percy Scott, whose opinion was that it would be too easily targeted by enemy artillery before it could be used.Glanfield 2006, p. 58 However, that was not the end of the line for the Revised Hetherington Proposal, because in early February, Hetherington attended a dinner at Murray's Cabaret Club in Soho hosted by Duke of Westminster, who had aggressively commanded an armoured car section in Samson's Dunkirk wing. Also present were Albert Gerald Stern, a former banker and one of Hetherington's officers, and James Radley, the racing driver. The duke was enthused by Hetherington's account of his machine and invited Churchill to a dinner party on 17 February where Hetherington was able to explain his proposal in detail.Smithers 1987, pp. 21-23 As a direct result, Churchill established of the Landship Committee, which was chaired by Eustace d'Eyncourt, the Director of Naval Construction, Stern was the secretary and Hetherington was joined by Colonel Wilfred Dumble of the Royal Naval Division who had previously managed the London General Omnibus Company.Harris 2015, p. 21 Although Hetherington's proposal was quickly found to be impracticable,Harris 2015, p. 22 William Tritton did construct a much smaller machine on the \\"Big Wheel\\" principle for the committee, but after numerous problems, it was abandoned on 8 June. The committee also followed several other lines of inquiry. This included a trip to Paris by Hetherington in April to investigate a new type of gel-filled laminate armour which proved to be useless.Smithers 1987, p. 31 On 30 June 1915, Hetherington himself drove a Killen-Strait tracked vehicle across broken ground and barbed wire in a demonstration at Wormwood Scrubs, attended by Churchill and David Lloyd George, the new Minister of Munitions.Hobbs 2017, pp. 157-158 Although the Killen-Strait tractor was too small to be useful, the trial would lead to the adoption of tracked propulsion for Little Willie, the first prototype tank.Harris 2015, p. 26 In January 1918, Major Hetherington was created a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for \\"services in connection with the origination of the Tanks\\". In November 1919, the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors concluded that \\"great credit\\" was due to Major Hetherington for his part in the development of the tank, but no monetary reward was due because his work had been within the scope of his duty. =Revised Hetherington Proposal Specifications= * Armament: 3 twin 4-inch gun turrets with 300 rounds per gun * Horse power: 800 h.p.

The area is home to some 900 acres (364 hectares) of vines in 27 vineyards, and was officially established as an AVA by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) in October 2013. Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, Viognier and Riesling are the principal white grape varieties within Kelsey Bench and its neighbor the Big Valley District AVA. The Zinfandel, Merlot and Cabernet Franc varieties make up the majority of red grape plantings in the area. The name ‚ÄúKelsey Bench‚Äù is a combination of ‚ÄúKelsey,‚Äù the surname of several early settlers in the area, and ‚Äúbench,‚Äù a term used to describe the terraces that rise above the lower elevations of the valley to the north. The AVA boundaries cover a series of tectonically- uplifted terraces in the southern half of a valley on the banks of Clear Lake. The Mayacamas mountains in the south and west separate the area from the southern end of Mendocino County, and the dormant Mount Konocti volcano lies to the east. The Red Hills Lake County AVA is on the south-eastern border of Kelsey Bench and when the appellation was formalized, the Red Hills boundaries were modified slightly to meet the Kelsey Bench boundaries. Kelsey Bench shares both the valley and the TTB's AVA ruling with the Big Valley District AVA to the north. The region's growers submitted the two petitions together, drawing a line between the valley floor and the higher elevations in the south. The higher elevations of Kelsey Bench mean that the climate here is warmer than in Big Valley District, although not so warm as Red Hills Lake County in the east. Cold air from the mountains drains off the benches into the valley below, extending the growing season by lessening the risk of frost in the early spring and fall. Vines are stressed by the strong winds that buffet the area, and photosynthesis, therefore ripening, is slowed as a result. This gives the grapes ample time to develop rich fruit complexity alongside vital acidity, leading to well-balanced wines. Kelsey Bench has predominantly rich, red, volcanic soils. Rosa d'Oro is the only winery located within the boundaries of the AVA.

Initiation  Paturi Nagabhushanam initiated boat libraries to inculcate reading interest, books, and libraries among the public. He started the Boat Library service in 1935 in addition to the other regular activities of the Andhra Pradesh Library Movement and conducted this service for about seven years for the Padapalem \\"Sevasrama Vani Mandir\\". In those days, all people of the Guntur district villages in Andhra Pradesh were relying on 'Boats' to travel and transport goods. Villagers were idling their boat travel time in chit-chatting. With the introduction of boat library services, people were availing the facility reading books, magazines, and learning about them. https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/he-kept- library-movement-afloat/article5916193.ece Boat Library Service  Opening Ceremony  The first boat library service launched on 1935 October 25 between the \\"Pedavadlapudi - Kollur\\" on the Krishna Bank canal with the patronage of the \\"Aryabala Society (Samajam)\\" and the \\"Sevashrama Vani Mandir\\". The opening ceremony was organised by Paturi Nagabhushanam at a grand scale at \\"Sevashrama Vani Mandir\\" in the presence of villagers, village heads, Mandal presidents and service members of \\"Seva Ashram\\". The event was formally inaugurated by 'Saranu Ramaswamy Chowdhary', the then President of the Guntur Mandala Library on 1935 October 25. The inauguration was ceremoniously organised on October 28 by the \\"Aryabala community\\" at their premises, from where the boat library boxes were picked up in big procession. The ceremony was attended by village dignitaries, senior citizens, and people from neighbouring villages. After conducting a meeting at the canal premises and lectures of dignitaries, book containers (boxes) were arranged on the boat. On this occasion \\"Vasireddi Annapurnamma of Chinapalem\\" has gifted a box for keeping books on the boat.Narasimha Sarma, Sannidhaanam (2014). Paturi Nagabhushanam: Jeevita Charitra.

Services  The boat library was run on the Krishna Bank Canal from \\"Pedavadlapudi to Kollur\\", pausing at docks on the way facilitating readers with books. As the boat library services became popular among the public, Paturi Nagabhushanam opened a second boat library in another twenty days, on 1935 November 17 to run between the villages of \\"Pedavadlapudi - Pidaparru\\". These libraries included literary journals such as \\"Bharathi\\", \\"Krishna Patrika\\", \\"Grandhalaya Sarvaswam\\", \\"Arogya Patrika\\", \\"Prakruti\\" and books. Some publishers, magazines and other contributors were donating books to these libraries. The services were temporarily suspended during the summer since there was less water in these canals.

The electoral district would be renamed Nanton-Claresholm prior to the 1930 Alberta general election. Malcolm McKenzie was elected the first MLA for Claresholm in the 1909 election, McKenzie was the incumbent, having been elected to the Macleod electoral district in 1905.

In keeping with the era's custom, McKenzie responded to the cabinet appointment by resigning his seat in the legislature to contest it in a by-election. Despite his previous wide margins, in 1912 he carried Claresholm by only 14 votes. McKenzie's tenure as treasurer was not to last long: he caught a chill while attending the convention that nominated him as the Liberals' Claresholm candidate in the 1913 election, and by the time he returned to Edmonton on March 10, 1913, he was sufficiently ill to confine himself to bed.

Hotten had opened a small bookshop at London at 151b Piccadilly the year before Chatto joined the firm. as Hotten diversified into publishing and Chatto learned the trade as Hotten did. Private life Chatto is generally regarded as having four children by Catherine (Katharine) Wallace Heard (c. 183911 October 1905), the daughter of military tailor Frederick Augustus Heard (1809second quarter of 1883) and Amelia Hollis Emmett (1809) who had married at St. Giles, Camberwell, London on 37 October 1829. Catherine married Joshua Carby Radway (c. 183627 December 1892) in the second quarter of 1858 in St. James's district in London. Census information suggests that Catherine had seven children: Frederick Augustus Radway, Michael John Radway, Joshua Carby Radway, Thomas Emmett Patrick Radway (later Thomas Chatto), Andrew Chatto Radway (later Andrew Chatto), Isabel Chatto, and Dorothea Chatto. Chatto identified four people as his children in his Last Will and Testament, namely Thomas, Andrew, Isabel, and Dorothea. The 1871 census found Chatto living in the same house as Katharine, her husband, and her two youngest children: Joshua and Thomas. Thomas had been registered as Thomas Emmett Patrick Radway. When Andrew was born later in the year, he was registered as Andrew Chatto Radway. The 1881 census found Chatto living with Katharine as his wife, Thomas, the three children born to Katharine since the last census, her father, and a cousin at Dartmouth Park Hill Road, in the London Borough of Camden. Thomas had now taken Chatto's surname as had Andrew. Chatto always treated them as his sons and brought them into the business with him. Katharine's husband died on 27 December 1892, and she married Chatto in the first quarter of 1899 at Holborn in London. Chatto & Windus When Hotten died suddenly in 1873, Chatto bought the firm from Hotten's widow for ¬£25,000 with money from the Poet William Edward Windus (18281910) who became his partner in Chatto & Windus. While Windus provide the finance, he was not an active partner, living for some of the time on the Isle of Man. Windus probably knew Chatto from when Hotten had published his first volume of verse in 1871. At the time, there were five ways in which books might be published: There were: *Outright sale of copyright. The publisher took the whole risk, but could make large profits. Jane Austen for example sold the rights of Pride and Prejudice for ¬£110 and saw the publisher make a profit of ¬£450 on the first two editions alone. Sometimes the sale of copyright was limited to a number of copies or a number of years. *Profit sharing. The publisher runs the risk, although sometimes the author is asked to contribute a fixed amount, and shared the profits with the author. This is subject to the risk that the publisher inflates the costs, to reduce the apparent profit. *Royalties. The publisher takes the risk and agrees to pay royalties on every copy, on every copy over a certain number, on every copy after production costs are met (subject to the risk of inflated costs). Sometimes the royalties could increase after a particular number of copies. *Publishing on commission. The author takes the risk, pays the costs of publishing, and the publisher takes a commission on each book sold (again subject to the risk of inflated costs). This is nowadays frowned upon as vanity publishing, but it was regarded as a legitimate form of publishing in the 19th century - this was the system that Jane Austen and many other authors of the time used. *Publishing on subscription, used more in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, where a number of subscribers agree to buy a copy and the money is used to pay for publication. The publisher might be paid a commission on sales. This was the way in which the Record of the Ripon Millenary Festival was published in 1892. Conflicts arose between publishers and authors because of: *Disagreement over the value of the copyright, or the failure to publish. Jane Austen bought back the copyright for Susan after the publisher whom she had sold it to had not published it. *The unwillingness of publishers to accept books on a royalty basis, and even if they did, disagreements on the rates of royalties. *Disagreements on amounts of the publishers costs. *Delays in payments to authors. The poet John Campbell (1777-1844) is said, during the height of the Napoleonic Wars to have induced a group of authors to drink to the health of Napoleon on the basis that he had once shot a publisher. Mark Twain told the Authors' Club in London in 1899 that It is of service to an author to have a lawyer, there is something so disagreeable in having a personal contact with a publisher. It is better to have a lawyerand lose your case Clearly relations between authors and their publishers were often fraught, and the risk of bad relations increased when publishers were less than honest in their dealings. Despite his speech, Chatto enjoyed very good relations with Mark Twain. When Chatto took over from Hotten, there were a number of legacy problems, resulting in part from Hotten's somewhat shady business practices. In particular, Hotten had alienated the poet Algernon Charles Swinburne by paying him little if any of the profits from the publication of his Poems and Ballads which had sold well. Chatto mended fences by sending Swinburn a cheque for ¬£50 and a formal request to publish his work. Chatto subsequently published Swinburn's Bothwell. Peters contrasted Chatto who was not only an active and successful publisher, but an honest one, compared with Hotten, who was something of a rogue. Hotten had spent years in the United States and knew more about American literature than any other publisher in London. He made ruthless use of this knowledge to pirate works by American authors, as few had taken any steps to copyright their work in England. One of the Hotten's victims was Mark Twain, but Chatto managed to establish good relations with him and they became good friends. Chatto worked his charm with other authors also, and Robert Louis Stevenson said: If you don't know that you have a good author, I know I have a good publisher. Your fair, open and handsome dealings are a good point in my life, and do more for my crazy health than has yet been done by any doctor.'' In 1876 Chatto brought in Percy Spalding (third quarter of 185413 August 1930) to help him manage the firm. Spalding was much more of a financial manager than a literary man, so Chatto was left to decide editorial matters himself. During the 1880's Chatto was determined to make Chatto & Windus the leading publisher of novels in London, and set out to dramatically increase their list. Chatto invested in expanding the list, buying the rights to the existing works of popular novelists such as Ouida, Wilkie Collins and others. He then reprinted them in cheap editions. He bought the remaining stock and copyrights of henry George Bohn's for ¬£20,000. His strategy was to dramatically increase the firm's share of the novel market, and be the first choice for novelists. He certainly won the good will of writers. The purchase of Bohn's stock also expanded the range and type of books that he published. Chatto saw periodicals as another possible outlet for the firm's authors (and for the intellectual property that the firm had bought.) He bought The Belgravia and its associated annual. He published The Idler from 1882 to 1911, and he also handled The Gentleman's Magazine. Swinnerton, who worked at the firm, recalls Chatto as: a gentle elderly man with a rolling walk, genially sweet in manner to every member of his staff, and much loved. Andrew Chatto and Rujub the Juggler The story of Rujub the Juggler illustrates two facets of Chatto's character, his support and encouragement for authors, the reason why Sutherland referred to the firm as the \\"hustlers\\" of the book trade. Chatto recognised and encouraged G. A. Henty's ability as a writer for adults. Chatto published four of Henty's eleven adult novels. Of these, Rujub, the Juggler was the biggest success, selling 11,000 copies, with most of these shortly after initial publication.Arnold said that the book had a period charm which he found surprising. and suggested that Henty's adult novels, which sold less than his juvenile titles, had been generally underrated. Rujub was first published in book form as a three-decker, or three-volume novel, without illustrations on 23 February 1893. The initial print run was for 500 copies. Chatto recognised that juveniles were also reading the Henty novels, and he published a single volume edition with eight illustrations by Stanley L. Wood in time for the Christmas market in 1893. Chatto had tremendous belief in Henty, and he ordered a print run of 3,000 for the illustrated edition (he had already printed 500 of the three-volume edition, and 2,000 of a single volume unillustrated colonial edition.) Chatto's actions sailed close to the wind on two accounts: *Chatto has agreed to the condition, set by the two largest circulating libraries, Smith's and Mudie, in their simultaneous circulars on 27 June 1894, that, among other things, publishers could not issue a cheaper edition in the UK within twelve months of its first acceptance by the libraries. The cheaper illustrated one-volume edition was published within nine months of the three-volume library edition. *Henty was under an exclusive contract for juvenile fiction with Blackie and Son. While an unillustrated three-volume novel was unquestionably for the adult market, the same could not be said of an illustrated single volume. Henty was concerned, and grew even more so in 1899 when Chatto released the book as a presentation edition.

The 1911 census found Chatto living with his daughter Isobel and her family in Larkrise, Aldenham Road, Radlett, Hertfordshire, England. Chatto retired from publishing in 1912. He died the following year, on 15 March 1913, at his daughters home. He was cremated at Golders Green on 18 March 1913. His estate was valued at just over ¬£14,000, and probate was granted to his sons Thomas and Andrew. His daughter Isobel retained possession of his papers and sold Chatto's papers, which included handwritten letters, manuscripts and a few book, at Sotheby's in 1916. In dying the year after he retired, Chatto was following the example of Windus, who retired from the firm in 1909 and died on 7 June of the following year (1910).

Publication history American miniature sculptor Duke Seifried founded his own company, Der Kriegspielers (\\"The Wargamers\\") in the 1950s to make Napoleonic figures for retail sale. In the late 1960s, Seifried corresponded briefly with J.R.R. Tolkien; later, when he was in England on business, he arranged to meet with the author. During his visit, Seifried offered to sculpt \\"some pewter Hobbits, Dwarves and Goblins\\" for Tolkien. Tolkien apparently liked the idea, and he and Seifried made some rough sketches on the spot. When Siefried returned to the United States, he had Tim Kirk, a young artist with the American Greeting Card Company, create some professional renderings of the sketches from which Siefried could then sculpt 25 mm miniatures. Tolkien died before Seifried was finished, but Seifried forged ahead with the project. In 1972, he formed the company Custom Cast in Dayton, Ohio. In late 1974, Custom Cast released a new line of 25 mm figures called Der Kriegspielers Fantastiques (\\"The Fantasy Wargamers\\"), and the first product was a set of miniatures based on characters from Tolkien's The Fellowship of the Ring. Coinciding with both the publication of the first fantasy role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons in 1974, and the continuing popularity of The Lord of the Rings in the United States, Der Kriegspielers Fantastiques proved to be very popular, and the Fellowship of the Ring line sold 10,000 units very quickly. Seifried quickly followed up with other Tolkienesque figures before branching off into more generic fantasy figures. Although Der Kriegspielers Fantastiques was the first very successful fantasy miniature line in the United States, it was not the first to be sold in the United States. As historian Shannon Applecline noted in the 2014 book Designers and Dragons, \\"US miniatures maker Jack Scruby beat Seifried to the fantasy punch with a 30mm line that he sold at Gen Con VII (1974).\\" Custom Cast later merged with Heritage Models, which continued to produce figures for the Fantastique line, even after Siefried left the company to work at TSR. Reception In the February‚ÄìMarch 1978 edition of White Dwarf (Issue #5), John Norris thought that the Tolkienesque figures of the Fantastiques line \\"should be of particular interest to Tolkien addicts, because they are by far the most suitable range currently available for wargames set in his Middle Earth.\\" He also thought the figures would be of use to other fantasy role-players not using a Middle Earth setting, saying they would \\"find that the personality figures, and indeed many of the ordinary ones, make excellent character figures, while dungeon owners will find the range a prolific source of 'monsters' with which to populate the dungeon and the surrounding wilderness.\\" Norris thought the quality of the small 25 mm figures was \\"generally good, except for the few very large ones, which are nearly all poor. The strongest point of the range is its variety. Not only does it cover all the major types, but it also provides an excellent selection of figures for each one.\\" Reviews * Campaign (Issue No. 83, Jan‚ÄìFeb 1978, Don Lowry) * The Journal Times (Racine, Ohio): June 26, 2004, p.14 References Category:Miniature figures ","title":"Der Kriegspielers Fantastiques"},{"id":"64036568","text":"William Marsey (born 29 September 1989) is a British composer.

Felmley wanted the school to focus on pedagogy and professional teacher preparation, and was thus unconcerned with faculty credentials. = Fight for normal schools = One of Felmley's main concerns, as well as his main point of conflict with the University of Illinois, was the position and existence of normal schools in Illinois. They suffered from persistent underfunding and were at risk of being relegated due to other state universities and private colleges offering teaching degrees. Felmley argued that the teachers colleges and normal schools, which often recruited and educated students from less privileged backgrounds, were the best institutions for training secondary school teachers. Felmley led the charge to turn normal schools in Illinois into four year baccalaureate institutions. = Political influence = Felmley‚Äôs political affiliation and influence defined his time at ISNU. He was the first Democrat to hold the office of president at the university and supported the right of the faculty to hold and express their individual political beliefs. It was also suspected by former president John W. Cook that Felmley‚Äôs vocal support of William Jennings Bryan in 1896 led to the delay in his presidency after Cook‚Äôs resignation. His political beliefs also influenced his hiring of faculty. In 1927, Felmley hired John A. Kinneman to join the university faculty despite the controversy that surrounded Kinneman‚Äôs outspoken support of the West Chester State Normal School‚Äôs Liberal Club and his defense of their meetings that led to him being fired. = Changes implemented = In 1907, ISNU was converted into a four-year baccalaureate institution, issuing bachelors of education degrees to its graduates. The university also began to offer more specialized curriculums for teachers in agriculture, manual arts, domestic science, and commerce, along with adding new programs to home economics and industrial arts. New buildings were also constructed on the campus, known today as Edwards Hall, Fell Hall, McCormick Hall, and Moulton Hall. Felmley supported the adoption of the metric system, reform of the university calendar, and the use of simplified spelling in all university publications. = Faculty = Felmley oversaw the beginnings of a more diverse faculty, hiring several Latino instructors to teach Spanish and potentially the first Jewish faculty member as well. He also fought for increasing the salaries of faculty at the university after World War I due to post-war inflation and the disparity in salary between ISNU and the University of Illinois. = Students = One of the main issues Felmley confronted was enrollment. The enrollment rate of the university was a consistent issue, especially after more normal schools opened in DeKalb, Macomb, and Charleston. Enrollment was also strongly affected by World War I, which saw low numbers of men in the normal department and extracurricular activities replaced by civilian war service, such as volunteering with the Red Cross. After ISNU became a four-year institution, Felmley only intended four year programs to have men enrolled in them. Felmley did not see the point of offering elementary school teachers more than two years of education at ISNU, as the vast majority of them were younger women who he believed would ‚Äúnot remain in the work longer than five years.\\"  Death  Shortly before his death, Felmley submitted his resignation as president of ISNU to the Normal School Board due to his physical health. Felmley had been dealing with prolonged illness for about fourteen months prior to his death. His condition had been considered critical in the week before his death, and in the hours before his death he was unconscious. Felmley died on January 24, 1930 in his home in Normal. After his death, ISNU students volunteered to guard his body as it lay in repose on campus prior to burial. He was buried in Carrollton City Cemetery in Carrollton, Illinois.  Legacy  To this day, Felmley is the longest- serving president of Illinois State University. There is a building named after him on campus, the Felmley Hall of Science.

It tells the story of a young girl, Monica, who wants to play with the Moon. Like The Very Hungry Caterpillar (1969), merchandise has been based on this story and it has been adapted to animation. Papa, Please Get the Moon for Me uses a distinctive collage style, typical of Carle's work by 1986, achieved by painting tissue paper, cutting it into pieces, and assembling it. The book's aim is to educate children about the phases of the Moon. Description Papa, Please Get the Moon for Me tells the story of Monica, a young girl who dreams of playing with the Moon. She cannot reach it and asks her father to bring it to her. He gets a ladder and, placing it atop a huge mountain, ascends to the Moon only to discover it is too big to carry down. The Moon agrees to shrink, becoming a waning crescent, and Monica plays with it until it shrinks so small that it vanishes. As the nights go by, she watches the Moon gradually reappear in the sky, going from waxing crescent to full Moon. The book introduces children to the lunar phases, showing the Moon \\"shrinking\\" and \\"growing\\" in the sky every night. The story also tackles concepts of wish-fulfillment and imagination.

The county was one of four counties comprising the Chickasaw Nation. Following statehood its territory was divided among several present-day Oklahoma counties. Map of Pickens County, Chickasaw Nation (1850-1907).  History  Chickasaw Indians, after emigrating from the southeastern United States to the Indian Territory (now Oklahoma) in the 1830s, were assigned to live within the boundaries of the Choctaw Nation. In 1855 the Chickasaw Nation was established as a separate entity. The boundaries and political subdivisions of the Chickasaw Nation may be traced to Choctaw laws and legislation. Until the Chickasaws‚Äô separation from the Choctaw Nation in 1855, the Choctaws divided their territory into four major administrative and judicial regions, or districts. Although Chickasaws were free to live anywhere within the Choctaw Nation they chose, most lived in its western region, known as the Chickasaw District. A constitutional change for the Choctaw Nation in 1850 enabled each of its four constituent districts to be divided into counties. The Chickasaw District was divided into Panola County in the southeast, Wichita County in the southwest, Caddo County in the northwest, and Perry County in the northeast.Arrell M. Gibson. The Chickasaws. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1974. Page 241. The precise date of the county's creation is unclear, but it had assumed its name and functions by at least November 1851, according to judicial proceedings published by the Bryan County Heritage Association in 1977.For information see Chickasaw National Records: Picks and Wichita Counties, 1849-1881.

Constables, or deputies, assisted the sheriff keep public order, particularly in Pickens County, which was much larger than most.Joseph B. Thoburn. Oklahoma: A History of the State and its People. Vol. 1. New York: Lewis Historical Publishing Co., 1929, p. 231. A federal law designed to prepare the Five Civilized Tribes for eventual statehood, known as the Curtis Act, stripped the Chickasaw government of meaningful powers after 1906. During the period following the Act's passage in 1898 the Chickasaw government became, according to one historian, an ‚Äúempty shell.‚Äù Even though the Chickasaw constitution and laws were still in effect, all significant powers had transferred to the federal government.Gibson, The Chickasaws, p. 308.  Geography  Pickens County lay in the southwestern part of the Chickasaw Nation between the Washita and Red rivers. The Washita River formed its eastern/northern boundaries, and its western boundary was the western edge of the Chickasaw Nation, also known as the 98th Meridian. Pickens County was unusually large and sprawling. It included the present-day cities of Ardmore, Duncan, Madill, Marietta, and Sulphur, extending almost as far as Chickasha. Rush Creek, Wild Horse Creek, and Caddo Creek were the largest streams traversing the county.Charles Goins, Historical Atlas of Oklahoma, 2006, p. 105. The county was defined by the Arbuckle Mountains, which formed a considerable barrier to movement and commerce in the center of the county. Pickens County's location on the western edge of the Five Civilized Tribes‚Äô domains left it exposed in its early years to external threats. Depredations and threats from the Kiowa, Comanche and Apache Indians, whose reservations lay to the west, caused the U.S. Army to bolster frontier defenses. A site on the Washita River was chosen, in 1850, as the location of Fort Arbuckle. The fort ceased to be strategically significant after the construction of Fort Sill to the west in 1869, and was abandoned in 1870. Despite its sprawl and size, the county was never home to a well-developed transportation network, with trails linking the settlements. A stagecoach route passed east‚Äìwest through the county, linking Fort Sill with Fort Arbuckle, entering the county on the west at Rush Springs Stage Station. The Chisholm Trail ran through the western part of Pickens County, passing through the settlements of Fleetwood, Duncan Store (now Duncan) and Parr (southeast of present-day Rush Springs). It was used first by Indian hunting and raiding parties, and, after 1867, by cattlemen driving livestock north. One railroad traversed the county: the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railroad, which passed north-to-south through Ardmore and Marietta. A singular point of geographic significance was established in Pickens County in 1870. General Land Office surveyors established Initial Point, or \\"point of beginning,\\" at 34¬∞ 30' 24\\" N latitude and 97¬∞ 14' 49\\" W longitude. From this point all land in Indian Territory and Oklahoma Territory, and later the State of Oklahoma except for its Panhandle, would be surveyed and described. The site was west of Davis, Indian Territory (now Davis, Oklahoma). It is considered one of the notable initial points in the United States.Entry for \\"Initial Point.\\" Oklahoma Encyclopedia of History and Culture, downloaded on May 22, 2020. https://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=IN037.  Statehood  As Oklahoma's statehood approached, its leading citizens, who were gathered for the Oklahoma Constitutional Convention, realized in laying out the future state's counties that the Chickasaw Nation's counties were not designed to support the requirements of a modern state. Three of the four counties were unusually large and geographically sprawling, possibly due to the relatively sparse population living there. Pontotoc County, as example, spanned the countryside in a northwestern-to-southeastern arc from north of Chickasha to west of Wapanucka. Pickens County posed similar challenges, stretching from the Chickasha area in the northwest to Madill in the southeast. Following statehood the influx of settlers from the United States allowed for the region to be broken into smaller counties. But first the historic Chickasaw counties had to be disestablished. This conundrum was recognized by the framers of the proposed State of Sequoyah, who met in 1905 to propose statehood for Indian Territory. The Sequoyah Constitutional Convention also proposed a county structure that abolished the Chickasaw counties. Pickens County was divided principally into the proposed counties of Bonaparte, Byrd, Curtis, Garvin, Gilbert, Guy, Harris, Jefferson, McLish, Overton, and Washington.Amos Maxwell, Sequoyah Constitutional Convention. Although the map carried in Wikipedia's article on the State of Sequoyah speaks to the matter of borders, Maxwell's book offers further insight. Much of this proposition was borrowed two years later by Oklahoma's framers, who adopted certain of these concepts for the future counties of Carter, Garvin, Grady, Jefferson, Love, Marshall, Murray, and Stephens counties. Pickens County ceased to exist upon Oklahoma's statehood on November 16, 1907.

At Ohio University he graduated with a bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1943 and a master's degree in zoology in 1944. For two years from 1944 to 1946 he served in the U.S. Navy as a hospital corpsman. In 1945 he served aboard the USS Rescue. In 1950 he received a Ph.D. in bacteriology from Harvard University. His doctoral thesis, supervised by J. Howard Mueller, is entitled Studies on the Interactions Involved in the Biosynthetic Mechanisms of Isoleucine and Valine in Escherichia Coli. From 1950 to 1959 Umbarger did research at Harvard. From 1957 to 1960 he was an assistant professor of bacteriology and Immunology at Harvard Medical School, but he was untenured. For the academic year 1959-1960, on leave of absence from Harvard, he worked at several laboratories in England. From 1960 to 1964 he held the appointment of Staff Investigator at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. At Purdue University he was appointed in 1964 a full professor and in 1970 Wright Distinguished Professor of Biological Sciences. He held that professorship until his retirement. Umbarger was a leading expert on biosynthesis of amino acids in bacteria. He is perhaps best known as the co-discoverer, with Edward A. Adelberg in 1953, of feedback inhibition in enzymology. While he was still a student, Umbarger married Merle Gladys Abele (1922‚Äì1993). They had three daughters. In 1995 he married his second wife.

O'Brien spent 42 years covering sports for the Montreal Standard, the Montreal Star, and Weekend Magazine, during which he covered 12 Olympic Games, six Commonwealth Games, 45 Stanley Cups, and 31 Grey Cups. Early life O'Brien was born in Renfrew, Ontario, on February 11, 1910, to a major league hockey trainer father. When his family moved to Montreal for his father's job, he worked as a stick boy for the Montreal Maroons during their 1926 Stanley Cup run and the Montreal Maroons Professional Lacrosse Club. O'Brien attended Loyola College, where he played on the football and heavyweight boxing teams. When he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1931, Canada was in the midst of the Great Depression and the only work he could find was at Eaton's selling hats. Career While working at Eaton's department store, O'Brien came in contact with sports editor Jimmy McDonagh, who hired him to cover amateur baseball games for the Montreal Standard. During his first game, a riot broke out over an umpire's call, and O'Brien's coverage of the event appeared on the front page of the paper the following day. As a result, the Montreal Standard hired O'Brien as one of their full- time reporters by the following week. As a sports editor for the Standard, covering hockey, O'Brien was sued by Detroit Red Wings defenceman Jack Stewart for libel after calling him a \\"ruffian\\". While working for the Montreal Star, O'Brien was sent to cover the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, specifically the \\"Miracle Mile\\" between Roger Bannister and John Landy. Prior to the event, Landy cut the sole of his right foot stepping on a broken beer bottle while showering, or stepping on and breaking a discarded photographer's glass flash bulb leaving the shower or while walking outdoors, but kept the injury hidden. O'Brien discovered the injury and subsequent stitches after the athlete admitted him to his guarded room, before he competed. O'Brien saw blood where Landy, lying covered with a blanket on a cot, had walked. Landy swore him to secrecy for fear of it coming off as an alibi, and then showed O'Brien the stitched wound. After Landy's loss to Bannister, O'Brien broke the story while also apologizing to Landy for spreading the news. His story was later confirmed by the doctor who had treated Landy, but the manager of the Australian team called the reports \\"pure bunk\\". Landy refused to communicate with O'Brien when the two met again at the Melbourne 1956 Olympic Games, although Landy later invited O'Brien and his wife to dinner in 1976 during the Montreal Olympic Games. Neither discussed the 1954 incident at the meal. O'Brien spent 42 years covering sports for the Montreal Standard, the Montreal Star, and Weekend Magazine, during which he covered 12 Olympic Games, six Commonwealth Games, 45 Stanley Cups, and 31 Grey Cups. In 1985, he was awarded the Hockey Hall of Fame's Elmer Ferguson Memorial Award, given \\"in recognition of distinguished members of the newspaper profession whose words have brought honour to journalism and to hockey.\\" He eventually died on April 19, 1987, due to illness.

The site is located along the Scioto Mile recreation area and historically was directly on the banks of the Scioto River. The civic center includes Columbus City Hall, the Ohio Judicial Center, Central High School (now the COSI science museum), the Joseph P. Kinneary United States Courthouse, and the former Columbus Division of Police headquarters. It also included the Broad Street, Main Street, and Town Street Bridges, which were replaced by the Discovery Bridge, a new Main Street Bridge, and Rich Street Bridge. Also sometimes included in the civic center are LeVeque Tower, the buildings immediately north and south of the Ohio Judicial Center, the new Michael B. Coleman Government Center, the current Columbus Division of Police headquarters, as well as the further Ohio Statehouse and Downtown YMCA. Following a local version of the City Beautiful movement, the Columbus Plan first envisioned a riverfront civic center in 1908. The Great Flood of 1913 destroyed many riverfront structures, allowing the opportunity to redevelop according to the 1908 plan. Columbus's most prominent architect, Frank Packard, spearheaded the project until his unexpected death in 1923. The Neoclassical, Renaissance Revival, and Art Deco buildings, bridges, and retaining wall were built from 1917 to 1934. In 1988, the area was nominated to the National Register of Historic Places as the Columbus Civic Center Historic District. Historic district The Columbus Civic Center Historic District is a historic district comprising most of the civic center. It includes Central High School (NRHP- listed, 1924), Columbus City Hall (built 1928), the former Central Police Station (1928), the Ohio Judicial Center (NRHP-listed, 1933), and the Joseph P. Kinneary United States Courthouse (NRHP-listed, 1934). It also includes the riverfront retaining wall, spanning from Broad to Town Streets. The c. 1921 Broad Street, Town Street, and Main Street Bridges were listed, though they were replaced on recent decades by the Discovery Bridge, the Rich Street Bridge, and a new Main Street Bridge. The buildings immediately north and south of the Ohio Judicial Center were included as non-contributing buildings. The historic district's nomination to the National Register of Historic Places was prepared in the late 1980s by the City of Columbus's Economic Development Division. The district was determined to be eligible for the National Register on September 14, 1988, due to its association with community planning, engineering, government, and transportation in the city, and for its Art Deco, Neoclassical, and Renaissance Revival architecture. Even though its suitability was confirmed, the district was never listed. History When Columbus was founded, the only planned green spaces downtown were around the Ohio Statehouse and in front of the Carnegie Library. The 1908 Columbus Plan recommended more green spaces, public promenades, and beautification. The plan urged the removal of the numerous factories, coal yards, boarding houses, and tenements stretching along the riverfront downtown. The city's prison, storage facilities, and a junk shop were also located on the riverfront there. Overall, about two dozen buildings deposited untreated sewage directly into the Scioto and Olentangy rivers between Clintonville and the South Side. The cleanup was urged to present a positive view of the city for travelers on the National Road entering Columbus from the west. Following a local version of the City Beautiful movement, the Columbus Plan first envisioned a riverfront civic center in 1908. The plan aimed to visually unite both banks of the river along with the nearby Capitol Square, and build classically-inspired yet simple buildings, surrounded by open spaces, parks, and parkways. Development was slow, though the Great Flood of 1913 in Columbus dramatically affected the area, destroying many riverfront buildings and both of its bridges. It gave the city the opportunity to redevelop the riverfront into its planned civic center, though with added flood control - a retaining wall and low head dam. The civic center layout was expanded to two to three times its original size. From 1917 to 1922, the Broad Street and Town Street Bridges, parallel Neoclassical structures, were built, along with the still-intact retaining wall between the bridges. In the early 1920s, the plan included a Masonic temple at the current site of the federal courthouse, and a park for World War I veterans at the site of the Judicial Center. The old Columbus City Hall was destroyed in a fire in 1921, allowing a new city hall to be built within the new civic center. In 1923, architect Frank Packard began a new civic center plan. He was Columbus's most prominent architect at the time, and organized the Allied Architects Association of Columbus to work on the civic center plan. Packard died later that year while working on the plan, before any of its buildings were built. The bridges, and other riverfront structures were already under construction or complete, but it led to the city planning its police station there, as well as an office building for state departments, and later the federal government moving its post office and courthouse from its former Capitol Square location to the new civic center. In 1924, Central High School opened, the first building built along the river since the 1908 plan was published. The school was designed following the plan, and its stone facade and scale acted as a link between the planned government buildings on the east bank with the school on the west. The site's government buildings were built next, between 1926 and 1934. Other government buildings, offices, and museums have been built in the civic center in years since.

Fred Beckey's Cascade Alpine Guide has the elevation of the mountain as 8,281 feet. Tenpeak is situated on the crest of the Cascade Range, on the shared border of Snohomish County and Chelan County, also straddling the boundary between the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest and the Wenatchee National Forest. Its nearest higher neighbor is Luahna Peak, to the southeast. Topographic relief is significant since the northern aspect of the mountain rises 4,200 feet above the Suiattle Valley in approximately . This mountain has small, unnamed, hanging glaciers in cirques surrounding the summit, and the terminus of the Honeycomb Glacier lies below the western base of the mountain. Precipitation runoff from the mountain and meltwater from the glaciers drains south into White River; or north into the Suiattle River. This mountain's descriptive name was suggested by The Mountaineers, and was officially adopted in 1918 by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. The first ascent was made September 21, 1940, by Lloyd Anderson and Tom Campbell. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences. Tenpeak Mtn from Glacier Peak The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured and shaped the landscape. Glaciation was most prevalent approximately , and most valleys were ice-free by .Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. Subduction and tectonic activity in the area began during the late cretaceous period, about . Extensive volcanic activity began to take place in the oligocene, about 35 million years ago. Glacier Peak, a stratovolcano that is northwest of Tenpeak Mountain, began forming in the mid-Pleistocene.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Due to Glacier Peak's proximity to Tenpeak Mountain, volcanic ash is common in the area. Climate Tenpeak Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger.

Early life and education  Legido-Quigley is one of five daughters. She grew up in Barcelona. Legido-Quigley started her undergraduate studies in the Department of Sociology at the University of Barcelona. She moved to the United Kingdom and continued her bachelor's degree at the University of Reading. After graduating, Legido-Quigley started a master's course in social policy at the University of Edinburgh. In the early 2000s Legido-Quigley volunteered in South Africa, where she worked to support maternal health. She has said that this experience inspired her to work in global health. On her return to the United Kingdom, Legido-Quigley started a doctoral degree at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine under the supervision of Martin McKee. As part of her research, she analysed the impact of austerity on the health of people in Spain. At the LSHTM she worked with Peter Piot, then Director of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, to understand the policy impacts of public health research.  Research and career  In 2002 Legido-Quigley joined the University of Manchester Institute for Development Policy and Management. She returned to the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine in 2004, where she worked as a research fellow in the Department of Health Services. In 2012 she was appointed a Lecturer in Global Health. Legido-Quigley joined the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health in Singapore as an Associate Professor. Legido-Quigley is a member of the Council of the World Economic Forum. She has argued that the barriers that migrants face to accessing healthcare are detrimental to their host countries, and called for governments to enhance their healthcare systems rather than turning people in need away. In 2019 Legido-Quigley analysed the gender and ethnic diversity of public health universities. As part of her analysis, she found that whilst across all levels of academic positions the proportion of men and women were equal, men were overrepresented in senior positions and women overrepresented in junior positions. She found that ethnic minorities were considerably less likely to progress through an academic career than their white counterparts. = Leadership on coronavirus disease = During the COVID-19 pandemic, Legido-Quigley contributed to and analysed the global public health response to coronavirus disease , and made use of social media to share information with the public. She has said that she was impressed by how quickly Singapore responded to SARS-CoV-2, which was likely informed by their experiences with the SARS epidemic years before. Unfortunately, Singapore's healthcare inequality was highlighted when a second wave of infections hit the island, spread by migrant workers. Legido-Quigley worked to analyse the public health responses of different countries, looking to establish best practise and better inform future strategies. She has said that austerity and long-term underinvestment in health services has drained the ability of healthcare systems to respond to SARS-CoV-2. Writing in The Lancet, Legido-Quigley analysed the building blocks of effective healthcare systems; and said that they included governance, financing, delivery, health workers and information. She said that to contain outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2, governments would have to invest in testing, hospitals and their health workers. She called for more clear guidance from the European Union on how to count the number of people who unfortunately pass away from coronavirus disease, as not all nations were using the same methodology, making comparisons of the public health response difficult.Legido-Quigley was also involved with analysis of the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in Asia and Europe.

According to Deneen \\"we should rightly wonder whether America is not in the early days of its eternal life but rather approaching the end of the natural cycle of corruption and decay that limits the lifespan of all human creations.\\" The book argues that liberalism has exhausted itself, leading to income inequality, cultural decline, the erosion of freedoms, and the growth of powerful, centralized bureaucracies. Reviews In a review for The New York Review of Books, Robert Kuttner described the book as \\"convenient for conservatives looking to blame all ills on liberals\\", to oppose globalization and market fundamentalism, perceiving liberalism as \\"a dangerous betrayal of deeper sources of culture and civilization such as the family, the tribe, the nation, and the church\\". Writing in The Week, Damon Linker described it as \\"the most electrifying book of cultural criticism published in some time\\", adding that Deneen argues that liberalism failed because it succeeded. However, Linker wrote that he did not find \\"especially persuasive\\" the claim made in the book that the Western liberal world was nearing its end.Damon Linker, An ominous prophecy for liberalism, The Week, January 22, 2018. Jennifer Szalai for The New York Times wrote that it \\"speaks to a profound discontent with the political establishment\\" and that Deneen echoes the popular 2016 election sentiment that both parties were the same. She adds that the book doesn't only attribute liberalism to one side but mostly to political elites orthodoxy dating to 500 years ago. She describes the book as \\"a deeply exasperating volume that nevertheless articulates something important in this age of disillusionment\\". Deneen proposes a more traditional society where \\"preferably religious communities tend to the land and look after their own\\" and is critical of a women's liberation that pushed them into capitalism.New York Times, 'If Liberalism is Dead, What Comes Next?, January 17, 2018 Park MacDougald wrote for New York that Deneen from a right-wing point of view criticizes liberalism not because of its materialist failures but from a philosophical standpoint and \\"what he sees as a liberal redefinition of the ancient and medieval concept of freedom, or libertas\\", that \\"liberalism's big innovation was to reject this classical understanding as unrealistic, unscientific, and oppressive\\". He concludes that \\"Why Liberalism Failed is a polemic, if an elegantly argued one, and it contains some of the drawbacks of the genre\\".New York Magazine, Has the Operating System for the Western World Crashed?, February 27, 2018 The conservative political journal American Affairs has published commentaries on the book by Polish philosopher Ryszard Legutko and Harvard University Law professor Adrian Vermeule.Ryszard Legutko, Can Democracy Save Us?, American Affairs Journal, February 2018Adrian Vermeule, Integration from Within, American Affairs Journal, February 2018.

Early life and education Hillier was born and raised in Seattle, where she attended the University of Washington for her Bachelor of Science and doctoral degrees. Career While finishing her doctoral degree at Washington State University, Hillier studied the bubonic plague and began to specialize in sexually transmitted diseases. This led her to join the HIV movement led by Polly Harrison and formed the Alliance for Microbicide Development. She co-published a study in 1991 titled Reliability of diagnosing bacterial vaginosis is improved by a standardized method of gram stain interpretation and attended the first White House Conference on HIV and AIDS in 1995 but was met with resistance. Hillier began teaching at the University of Washington as a research associate professor of obstetrics, gynecology and microbiology, before joining the faculty at the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) in 1995. While at Pitt, Hillier continued her study into HIV and Aids and founded the Microbiocide Trials Network (MTN), an international research program which studies ways to stop transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. After a failed study conducted in 2001 showed nonoxynol did not prevent HIV infections, her project tried studies on spermicides and substances designed to block the entry of viruses into cells, both of which failed. During this time, she was appointed president of the Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology and sat on the board of the International Society for Sexually Transmitted Disease Research. In 2009, it was announced that Hillier would lead a National Institutes of Health funded project to identify novel bacteria that might play a role in the development of pelvic inflammatory diseases. She also received the American Sexually Transmitted Diseases Association's Thomas Parran Award during the International Society for Sexually Transmitted Diseases Research (ISSTDR) meeting \\"for her distinguished contributions to the field of STD research and prevention.\\" The following year, Hillier led a study in five countries of sub- Saharan Africa regarding the effectiveness of topical microbicides and prophylactic use of antiretroviral drugs in preventing the sexual transmission of HIV. One of the studies proved tenofovir gel was successful in preventing HIV infections although it was unable to be reproduced by outside labs. By 2013, the MTN conducted 13 trials and was granted $70 million to develop and test HIV prevention products. The research was specifically focused on individuals who are having sex with men as they are at the highest risk. During this time, she also served as chair of the NIH Office of AIDS Research Advisory Council. In 2015, Hillier and Lisa Rohan conducted and concluded the first human clinical trials for antiretroviral containing vaginal film products intended to prevent HIV infection. She also sat on the editorial boards of Infectious Diseases in Obstetrics and Gynecology, Reviews in Contemporary Pharmacotherapy, Sexually Transmitted Diseases and Anaerobe. In 2019, Hillier was the recipient of the Pittsburgh Women who Rock Award from the UPMC Health Plan and UPMC Magee-Women's Hospital. Personal life Hillier and her husband Butch have two children together.

He was chief of laboratory at the Faculty of Medicine of Paris. Gouraud's best known work on dietetics was Que Faut-Il Manger?. It was translated as What Shall I Eat? in 1911. Armand Gautier wrote a preface for the book. It was positively reviewed in medical journals. The book is an impartial survey of important dietary questions and the reasons why specific foods should be consumed or rejected according to normal or pathological conditions. It was described in a review as a \\"scientifically correct discussion of nutrition and diet, from the common food standpoint.\\" The book is notable for its chapters on alcohol, vegetarianism and white bread. Gouraud concluded that a strict vegetarian diet is inadvisable for most people but a modified version with eggs and milk (ovo-lacto vegetarianism) is more rational. He favoured an omnivorous (mixed diet) as the most suitable diet for mankind. A review for the original French version in the British Medical Journal commented that \\"the book will be found useful by any practitioner who wishes to construct a dietary for any purpose, and the cautions and recommendations contained in it are sound\\".

Description Lakefront liberals are described as geographically residing along the lakefront of Chicago in neighborhoods such as Lake View and Lincoln Park. Some included the South Side lakefront neighborhood Hyde Park as another area of Chicago where they occupied. They are predominantly white professionals. Many of the members of the coalition were born during the baby boom. Their beliefs included \\"good government\\" and racial equality. Electoral impact Lakefront liberals were credited with the two-term election of 44th Ward alderman Dick Simpson in the 1970. Another alderman considered a lakefront liberal was William Singer. Yet another alderman considered one was David Orr, who later became a long-serving Cook County Clerk. Lakefront liberals were credited with contributing to the elections of Harold Washington in 1983 and 1987. Modern status Some analysts believed that Lakefront liberals supported Rahm Emanuel in his 2011 election. Some writers believed that Lori Lightfoot was the beneficiary of lakefront liberals' support in the 2019 Chicago mayoral election. In the initial round the election, Bill Ruthhart of the Chicago Tribune wrote that her, \\"base proved to be in the liberal lakefront wards on the North Side.\\" In the initial round, Lightfoot saw particularly strong performances in far north lakefront neighborhoods. Lightfoot also carried the endorsement of former lakefront liberals-supported alderman Dick Simpson. =Possible extinction= Lakefront liberals are considered by some political writers to be largely extinct. Edward McClell wrote this in a late-2019 Chicago magazine article. McClell argued that Lakefront neighborhoods on the North Side of Chicago have become among of the wealthiest neighborhoods in Chicago, and have also become some of the most conservative-leaning neighborhoods. North side lakefront communities were among the most supportive areas for Mayor Rahm Emanuel (who was regarded as an \\"establishment\\" politician) in his elections. McClell wrote that it is theorized that much of the former lakefront liberals voting base left the geographic where the coalition once occupied, after being priced-out, moving to neighborhoods such as Wicker Park, Logan Square, and Avondale, making up part of what is now known as the \\"Milwaukee Avenue Progressives\\".

Roche was granted a monopoly to mine metals in Scotland, and work salt on the shore near Edinburgh, but his contract was terminated in 1592. His surname was sometimes written \\"Roghe\\", or Rogghe\\", or \\"Roogh\\". He lived in Leith. He had a contract for lead mining in 1580.William Boyd, Calendar of State Papers Scotland: 1574-1581, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1907), p. 563. In August 1583 James VI granted Eustachius Roche a contract with monopoly rights to mine for gold, silver, copper, and lead in Scotland. He was described as a \\"mediciner\\", a physician.David Masson, Register of the Privy Council of Scotland: 1578-1585, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1880), pp. 601-2: Acts of Parliaments, vol. 3, pp. 368-371. There were other miners at this period including George Douglas of Parkhead and Thomas Foulis. A note made in September 1584 about his work at Wanlockhead reports that Roche had worked lead and copper, and searched for copper on Langcleuch burn, but not the gold at the old mines. One of his men was called John Gibson.Robert William Cochran-Patrick, Early Records Relating to Mining in Scotland (Edinburgh, 1878), pp. 50-1. He seems also to have worked for Francis Walsingham, and wrote to him in April 1583 about an opportunity to serve England involving the French ambassador which he had taken.William Boyd, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1581-1583, vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1914), pp. 416-7. On 25 September 1588 Eustachius wrote from Edinburgh to a colleague Geoffrey le Broman. He discussed their alchemical practices. He had also been making salt from sea water, and claimed to have a new method that would undercut the price of French salt. He had made a contract with James VI that would make him rich, and Robert Sidney, who had recently been English ambassador in Edinburgh, had begun to discuss a similar privilege for him in England. Sidney left Edinburgh sooner than planned because of the death of his uncle, the Earl of Leicester.Edmund Lodge, Illustrations of British History, vol. 2 (London, 1791), p. 378. Roche thought Geoffrey could forward his schemes by reminding Sidney, preferably by approaching an acquaintance, Stephen Lesieur, Sidney's secretary. Geoffrey might also speak to Francis Walsingham. He enclosed a sample of salt and some Scottish flax that might interest a Master Martin.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 9 (Edinburgh, 1915), pp. 618-9. Eustachius sent a copy of his salt contract, to work salt pans at Newhaven on the west side of Leith, as a model.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 9 (Edinburgh, 1915), p. 610, TNA SP52/42 f.113: David Masson, Register of the Privy Seal of Scotland: 1585-1592, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1881), pp. 319-320. Roche had these privileges for his trade secret, \\"the form of his furnaces and making of his great salt, which he will he not be content be communicated to others\\".Robert William Cochran-Patrick, Early Records Relating to Mining in Scotland (Edinburgh, 1878), p. 81. In April 1588 the Privy Council, impressed with his estimates to improve revenue, made an act that Roche's heirs would inherit his 10% share. The council also declared it would seek justice for the murder of his workman Nicholas Wanraust or Van Raust.David Masson, Register of the Privy Council of Scotland: 1585-1592, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1881), pp. 270-1. On 27 December 1588 Edinburgh council allowed Roche the same lease or \\"tack\\" of lands at Newhaven, as the Englishmen had before, meaning the works previously set to Cornelius de Vos and his partners. The works were at the shore of the Wester Links of Leith between Wardie Brow and St Nicolas Chapel.John Marwick, Extracts from the Burgh Records of Edinburgh: 1573-1589 (Edinburgh, 1882), pp. 534, 538. In July 1590 he was asked to pay three years arrears of rent for the Newhaven holding. He gave up his lease on 12 May 1592.Marguerite Wood, Extracts from the Burgh Records of Edinburgh: 1589-1603, vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1927), pp. 23, 64. In 1592 David Lindsay of Edzell complained to the Privy Council about Roche and his contract for metals. Lindsay had discovered copper on his lands of Glen Esk and Edzell. But Roche had a monopoly on mining in Scotland, so Lindsay offered to form a partnership. He wanted the Privy Council to summon Roche and make him form a partnership or allow Lindsay to manage his own mines. Accordingly, Roche and Lindsay formed a partnership, and Roche was to pay his share of Lindsay's costs to date. This was a manouevre to wrongfoot Roche.Robert William Cochran-Patrick, Early Records Relating to Mining in Scotland (Edinburgh, 1878), pp. lxii, 37-39. Soon after, in June 1592, the Parliament of Scotland created a new office, the Master of Metals to be in charge of mines and refining. John Lindsay of Menmuir, the brother of David Lindsay, was appointed. In order to ensure Roche resigned his rights, information damaging his reputation was collected from the Dutch Republic and Flanders by the means of the diplomat Adrian van Damman, the Conservator of Scottish Privileges at Veere, and a Scottish merchant in Antwerp, Jacques Barron, and it was said he was of \\"evil fame.\\" The murder of one of his workmen, Nicholas van Raust, at the lead mine by a man called Gibson was deemed irrelevant to mining issues.Robert William Cochran-Patrick, Early Records Relating to Mining in Scotland (Edinburgh, 1878), pp. 48-50. Robert Jousie, whose business partner Thomas Foulis had a copper mine, wrote to the Conservator of Privileges, Robert Dennistoun, about an old legal case concerning Roche, who confirmed \\"It imports no small dishonour and interest to his Majesty and the country so long to suffer an infamous person to have charge of the mines.\\"Robert William Cochran-Patrick, Early Records Relating to Mining in Scotland (Edinburgh, 1878), pp. 50-1. Archibald Napier of Merchiston Castle responded to the act appointing Lindsay and advised on the \\"reduction\\", the legal challenge, to Roche's contract.Robert William Cochran-Patrick, Early Records Relating to Mining in Scotland (Edinburgh, 1878), pp. 52. While interested parties were submitting their views to the Privy Council, Marion Douglas, the wife of George Douglas of Parkhead, was trying to manage their lead and silver mines in August 1592. She wrote to Menmuir about the uncertain status of their contract in the new legislative framework. She had to put the workmen to other tasks, or lay them off.Robert William Cochran-Patrick, Early Records Relating to Mining in Scotland (Edinburgh, 1878), p. 92. Eustachius Roche's mining rights were removed, and he may have left Scotland. However in 1599 his monopolies and patents for improved kilns and stoves, chimneys and furnaces were ratified by the Parliament of Scotland.David Masson, Register of the Privy Council of Scotland: 1599-1604, vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1884), p. 18: Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland, vol. 4, p. 187.

Biography Glimpses at the Plant world illustration Bergen was born Frances Dickerson in Mansfield, Ohio on 4 February 1846, to Thomas Dickerson and Rachel Gault of Richland County. Bergen worked as a teacher in old Woodville school then, Cleveland, Chicago and eventually at her alma mater Antioch College. Bergan attended Mansfield High school followed by Antioch College, Ohio graduating in 1975. During her time there her husband botanist Joseph Young Bergen had also attended, completing his master's while she was there. They married in 1876. Bergen was a folklorist who worked on superstitions and customs. She had a specific interest in horticultural superstitions. As a result of her work documenting American immigrant animal and plant lore Bergen is regarded as being an early female pioneer of ethnobiology. She also worked with her husband on a number of botanical books. In 1879 Bergen became ill with a spinal disease which invalided her. She was also a contributor to Popular Science Monthly and Journal of American Folklore. She was considered an authority on folklore despite her inability to go into the field. Her grandmother told her stories from her life in Lake George, New York and talked about quilts.

It consists of a courtyard with a fountain nestled between two academic buildings with an illuminated canopy framing the sky above. Background James Turrell graduated from Pomona College in 1965. Starting in the 1970s, he created a series of skyspaces that framed the sky. He was approached by the college when it was designing the Lincoln Hall and Edmunds Hall academic buildings and asked to create an installation for the Draper Courtyard located between them. Description Interior courtyard Red granite benches line a partially-enclosed courtyard with a shallow black granite infinity pool. A thin brightly-colored steel canopy covers the installation, with a nearly cutout or aperture, that contains an LED lighting array. At night, the hidden LED lights illuminate the canopy. Every hour between sunset and sunrise, they \\"chime\\", rotating through a series of colors over three minutes, and longer light shows take place daily at sunrise and sunset. The shows slightly vary with each day to match changing conditions over the course of a year. Short trees and other landscaping surround the exterior. Construction The work is Turrell's first public installation in Southern California. It cost to complete. It was constructed in consultation with Marmol Radziner, AIA, and Amazing Steel. It underwent maintenance work in 2018. Reception Illuminated pink at dusk The installation received critical praise. A Los Angeles Times review called it \\"one of the best works of public art in recent memory\\", lauding \\"Turrell's capacity to pull experiences of sensual refinement out of the heavens\\". Other critics noted its easy accessibility. It is associated with the Light and Space movement that originated in Southern California in the 1960s, and of which Turrell is a prominent member.

It is available as an periodically-updated webpage. It is available in pdf format. __TOC__ Numbers The CPIP document describes at least two pandemic situations: *A pandemic of \\"mild to moderate\\" severity could sicken 10.6 million Canadians, send 138,000 to hospital, and kill up to 58,000. *A \\"severe\\" pandemic would be catastrophic, killing up to two per cent of the population, or 700,000 Canadians. History CPIP dates from February 2004. The province of British Columbia had a Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Plan as early as October 2005. A March 2006 press release by Minister of Health Tony Clement references CPIP extensively. Clement pointed at the then-new www.pandemicinfluenza.gc.ca website. Both the Canadian Medical Association and Canadian Pharmacists Association, with a combined membership of approximately 63,000 health care professionals, were pleased to participate in the publicity. In 2006, Dr Theresa Tam, who was later to become the CPHO, was a lead author for the CPIP document. The report advises that there be a 16-week stockpile of medical supplies to cover two pandemic waves. In 2007, because CPIP had suggested in 2004 the use of antivirals as prophylaxis, a public consultation was held by PHAC to gauge the public's reaction. CPIP Doctrine 2009 was for hospitals to cancel \\"non-emergency procedures\\", and antechambers would contain no toys or reading material. Doctrine 2009 \\"also cautions against the kind of knee-jerk reactions that do absolutely nothing to protect public health: the distribution of masks, the installation of extra hand-sanitizer dispensers in public places, the recruitment of increased number of cleaners at office buildings. Doctrine 2009 held that \\"an all-out travel ban does little else but stoke public anxiety and hammer local economies. If anything, your flight will be cancelled because so few people bought a ticket - not because the government said so.\\" As early as 2009, CPIP pointed out that improved flu screening was needed at airports. In 2010, a Senate committee evaluated Canada's response to the recent H1N1 pandemic, and referenced the CPIP extensively. Even then it was understood that CPIP was to be updated regularly. In 2011, the Harper government signed a deal with a Canadian pharmaceutical manufacturer to provide vaccine for 32 million Canadians because this course of action had been suggested by CPIP. The so-called \\"CPIP Task Group\\" wrote in 2017 that \\"The contract stipulates that the (domestic) manufacturer fulfill their commitment to Canada before selling the vaccine to other countries, ensuring an adequate supply for every person residing in Canada\\"; it also pointed out that the first contract with a vaccine manufacturer was placed in 2001, under the Chretien government. In 2017 Canada Communicable Disease Report, a scientific publication which is mandated by the IHR as part of its communication strategy, published Canada‚Äôs pandemic vaccine strategy, and that article focuses on CPIP and its consequences.

The AERA invited Lee to discuss the significance of her 2019 study, ‚ÄúAligning English Language Proficiency Standards with Content Standards: Shared Opportunity and Responsibility Across English Learner Education and Content Areas,‚Äù in a published video. At present her research: # addresses diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM, including computational thinking, that is grounded in contemporary theoretical perspectives; # integrates multiple education disciplines on behalf of all students, especially English learners; and # connects to educational policy and practice at the national level. Lee‚Äôs first two decades of research, starting in the early 1990s, established her as a leader in science education and equity. With funding from the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Education, her research grew to large- scale intervention research to promote science learning for English learners across the four largest school districts in Florida. Lee was named to the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) writing team and was leader of the NGSS Diversity and Equity Team from 2011 to 2013. At the same time, she was a member of the steering committee for the Understanding Language Initiative at Stanford University. With Helen Quinn and Guadalupe Vald√©s, Lee produced a study on science and language for English language learners in relation to NGSS. The AERA invited Lee to discuss the significance of her 2013 study, ‚ÄúScience and Language for English Language Learners in Relation to Next Generation Science Standards and with Implications for Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts and Mathematics,‚Äù co-authored with Quinn and Vald√©s, in a published video.

He notably served during the War of American Independence.  Biography  La Cardonnie joined the Navy as a volunteer in 1744, and became a Garde-Marine in 1746. He served on Alcyon in the Caribbean and in Canada, and was promoted to Ensign on 17 May 1751. In 1753, he was accepted as a member of the Acad√©mie de Marine. He was promoted to Lieutenant on 17 April 1757, and to Captain in February 1772. In 1767, La Cardonnie was captain of Berg√®re. He surveyed the coast of Saint-Domingue. In 1769, he sailed Berg√®re to Havana, Rochefort, Bordeaux and Saint-Domingue. La Cardonnie captained the 74-gun Diad√®me at the Battle of Ushant on 27 July 1778. She was nominally in the rear-guard of the French fleet, but since the Orvilliers' line was in reverse order, her position at the lead ship of the Third Division of the Blue Squadron made her the first ship of the battle line. After the battle, he was subject of an inquiry for his failure to engage the British. He wrote a memorandum in his defence, but was relieved of command. In 1779, La Cardonnie had a duel in Paris with his former first officer, Schantz. Schantz was exiled to Sweden as punishment. In 1780, La Cardonnie captained the 74-gun Actif and cruised off Cadiz and Saint-Vincent. He captured the British Hercule, Wright, master, off Saint-Vincent. La Cardonnie proposed to use Actif for commerce raiding in addition to her usual duties of convoy escort.

The formation of this society was at least partially in response to a National Research Committee (NRC) on Exposure Assessment that held a series of meetings and workshops beginning in 1987 that formed the foundation of exposure science and defined basic principles. The expertise of members in ISES is interdisciplinary and draws upon a broad array of disciplines, including: exposure assessment; biochemistry; risk assessment; bioinformatics; physiology; toxicology; epidemiology; ecology; environmental chemistry; and environmental engineering. The Society‚Äôs membership is professionally diverse and includes academic, governmental, and private sector scientists, as well as policy makers who have a common interest in exposure science. ISES has operated with a President, President-elect, Treasurer, and Secretary as well as Councilors. Councilors are elected from the membership and are allocated from the various professional categories that represent Society membership (academia, government, private sector, and students). The first set of Bylaws was approved by the membership in 1991. ISES hosts an annual conference and is associated with a scientific journal (the Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology, JESEE). The society often partners with other international societies when hosting an annual conference. In 2018, the annual conference was held in Ottawa, Canada with the International Society for Environmental Epidemiology (ISEE) and received attention from NIEHS for the broad range of topics to be highlighted at the conference from E-waste to natural disasters. In 2019, ISES partnered with the International Society for Indoor Air Quality (ISIAQ), and the conference was held in Lithuania focusing on air pollution and associated impacts on the built, natural, and social environments.  Awards  In past years, ISES has developed several awards within the organization. These include the Jerome J. Wesolowski Award for contributions to the knowledge and practice of human exposure assessment, the Joan M. Daisey Outstanding Young Scientist Award, which recognizes a young scientist in exposure science whose degree was conferred within the past 10 years, and the Constance L. Mehlman Award which recognizes contributions in exposure analysis that helped shape a national or state policy or that provided new approaches for reduction or prevention of exposures. Lastly, the Distinguished Lecturer Award was developed in recognition of an individual within the field who promotes the mission and goals of the ISES organization.

Life  Victoria Barr was born in New York, NY, in 1937 to the curator and art historian Alfred H. Barr, Jr. and art historian Margaret Scolari Barr. As a child, she spent summers in Greensboro, Vermont, with her parents, as well as attended a number of residential camps focusing on the arts. Barr often traveled to Europe with her parents from the age of 14 onwards, meeting influential artists like Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, and Marc Chagall and collectors like Peggy Guggenheim. For high school, she went to Milton Academy in Milton, Massachusetts. After high school, she briefly attended Radcliffe College (1955‚Äì1956). Then she studied at the Parsons School of Design, focused on graphics and advertising. There she took classes in art history from Leo Steinberg and in color theory from Si Sillman, who was Josef Albers' studio assistant at Yale. Afterward meeting Sillman, Barr decided to attend the Yale Art School, graduating in 1961. She started at Yale working to be a commercial artist in graphics then started taking painting classes from Neil Welliver, then with Albers, another one of his assistants Cy Twombly, as well as Bernard Chaet and William Bailey. She lived and worked in Aspen for some time in the early 1960s. Back in New York, she worked for a time as a secretary to the art dealer Steven Spector. Then in 1964, she traveled to Paris, France on a Fulbright scholarship, along with fellow artist and Fulbright scholars Nancy Graces, who would later married Richard Serra whom joined their group in Paris, and Philip Glass. After two years in Paris, she returned to the US in 1966 and got a job at the Museum of Natural History in the exhibition's department for a year. Barr later taught courses at Hunter College and at Barnard. She still lives in New York, NY.  Artwork  Barr is most well known for her abstract landscapes, which come out of a tradition of post-war American Abstract Expressionism, Lyrical Abstraction, and Color Field painting. Her early works she described as \\"filmstrip-type\\" paintings and later \\"stained paintings.\\" She also connected her work to an interest in landscape to Chinese landscape painting in terms of different layers of gradation. Her work often deals with her interest in understanding the world, outside of the European Christianity. Her extensive travels throughout Europe, South and East Asia, and the Pacific were part of this research project. In 1970, Barr's work was shown at the John B Meyer's Gallery with work in acrylic and watercolor and a series of \\"stained paintings\\" at Larry Aldrich. In 1981, she had a show at the Haber Theodore gallery in New York. She has works in a number of important collections, including Surfacing (1971) in the Whitney Museum collection and the University of North Dakota's collection.

It was originally just planned as a 6-page story, but was expanded as Yoshitomi saw potential to develop the setting further, and was serialized by Sh≈çnen Gah≈çsha in 2010‚Äì2014 in their magazine Change H; it has since been collected in two tank≈çbon volumes. A one-shot finale, , was published in 2016, and was collected in a volume together with Yoshitomi's series Lily System in 2019. The story is set in the near future in Japan after birth rates have declined significantly, and follows Kenji, who has been chosen to be part of a government initiative to counteract this, where men are put through a feminization procedure that makes them able to give birth. Critics called the story emotionally resonant, but considered its premise of forcibly having one's body altered questionable. Plot Balance Policy is set in Japan in a near future after birth rates have declined dramatically worldwide, particularly of girls. To counteract this, the government has invested large amounts of money into enacting policies and procedures to feminize men, making them able to give birth, and has over the course of ten years done this with 934 people. Kenji, one of the main characters, is chosen as one of those to undergo this, and returns home after a year looking like a woman, and catches up with his best friend Masaomi; the story depicts the psychology of the characters following the change, and Masaomi's confusion. Although the series is billed as a transgender manga, Kenji is portrayed as still identifying as male, with the changes only applying to his body. Production and release Balance Policy was written and illustrated by Akihito Yoshitomi, who initially intended to finish the story in just six pages, but continued as he thought there was room to continue developing the setting. The series was serialized by Sh≈çnen Gah≈çsha in their magazine Change H, a manga anthology featuring stories with transgender or cross-dressing themes, starting with issue 3 on April 26, 2010. It stayed on the magazine through its title change to Trans Switch in 2013, until the magazine's final issue on February 28, 2014. Sh≈çnen Gah≈çsha later collected the series in two tank≈çbon volumes under TS Comics, their imprint for transgender-themed manga, and released them from November 19, 2012 to May 31, 2014. At release, the tank≈çbon volumes came bundled with art prints of Balance Policy illustrations at some book stores. A one-shot finale, Tokyo Shoujo, was published by Sh≈çnen Gah≈çsha in Young Comic July 2016 issue on June 10, 2016, and was included in the tank≈çbon release of Yoshitomi's series Lily System, which was released on March 11, 2019 under Sh≈çnen Gah≈çsha's YK Comics imprint. =Volumes=Reception IT Media included Balance Policy in a feature on recommended manga with transgender themes. They called it charming, describing its straight-forward narrative tone as gripping, and saying that the careful depiction of the characters' psychology made for an emotionally resonant story. Da Vinci called the premise ridiculous, and questioned whether the need to raise the birth rate could conceivably be dire enough for people to be forced into a feminization procedure the cost of a jet fighter, without being able to protest. Similarly, according to pop culture news site Akiba Blog, readers considered the premise \\"surreal\\", but still found it interesting. Kono Manga ga Sugoi! included the series in a feature on the history of LGBT manga as an example of a transgender manga with a strong social focus. The first volume of the series was among the highest selling manga of its debut week.

The proposal, drafted by Jacobs Engineering Group in coordination with Central Atlanta Progress, was first proposed in August 2016 and would cover an area of approximately .  History  Part of the Downtown Connector, facing north from Downtown Atlanta The proposal was first put forward by Central Atlanta Progress (CAP) in August 2016 as a way to reclaim land area taken by the Downtown Connector, a section of Interstate 75 and Interstate 85 that runs through downtown and midtown Atlanta. Similar discussions had been held at CAP as early as 2003 and have included similar proposals for the area near the Georgia State Capitol. The study, prepared for CAP by Jacobs Engineering Group at a cost of $100,000, called for a stretch of reclaimed land covering a stretch of the Downtown Connector from Spring Street to Piedmont Avenue in downtown. The study, which compared the project to the Klyde Warren Park in Dallas, said the project would cost approximately $300 million and stimulate approximately $1.1 billion in land development and increased property value. Unlike Klyde Warren Park, The Stitch would involve the creation of multiple parks. The reclaimed land would also allow for the reconnection of Atlanta's street grid, which was interrupted by the construction of the Connector. Between 2017 and 2018, CAP conducted a year- long viability study on the project that involved Jacobs and John Portman and Associates. In March 2019, the Urban Land Institute (ULI) published a feasibility study on the project, while that same month the estimated cost for the project was stated at $452 million. Advisors from the ULI estimated that the project could take four years of planning and pre-development and six years of construction.

They were made of wood or tin and were in use from the ninth or tenth century until at least the fourteenth. There are over a hundred known Arabic blockprints on paper, parchment and possibly papyrus. They are mostly small strips intended for use in amulets. They have mainly been identified in public and private collections, but a few prints have been recovered archaeologically at Fus·π≠ƒÅ·π≠ in Egypt. No ·π≠arsh itself has yet been found. The origin of ·π≠arsh, whether borrowed along with paper from China or invented independently in the Islamic world, is disputed. Richard Bulliet suggests that the contrast between the rapid adoption of paper and the marginalization of printing suggests a separate origin for each and thus the indigenous development of ·π≠arsh. The origin of the word ·π≠arsh is uncertain. The Semitic root ·π≠.r.sh is related to deafness and ·π≠.r.s to writing (including the word for palimpsest), but an Egyptian origin has also been mooted. The amulet texts printed from ·π≠arsh contain texts from the Qur æƒÅn and lists of the names of God. They were rolled up and placed in metal cylinders that were worn around the neck. There are examples of calligraphy and at least one example of a Qur æƒÅnic print that looks like the page of a book. Texts were often printed from more than one block. The longest known text is 107 lines, printed from two blocks on a 2\\" x 11\\" strip of paper. Medieval Arabic blockprinting had been completely forgotten by the time Joseph Karabacek identified some prints in 1894. To date, only two medieval references to printing are known from the Islamic world, both in passages about the Ban≈´ SƒÅsƒÅn, the informal guild of beggars, thieves and confidence men. According to Ab≈´ Dulaf al-Khazrajƒ´, writing in Persia in the tenth century: > The engraver of ·π≠arsh is he who engraves moulds for amulets. People who are > illiterate and cannot write buy them from him. The seller keeps back the > design which is on it so that he exhausts his supply of amulets on the > common people and makes them believe that he wrote them. The mould is called > the ·π≠arsh. There is physical evidence in some prints that ·π≠arsh were at times made by pouring molten tin in clay moulds. According to ·π¢afƒ´ al-Dƒ´n al-·∏§illƒ´, an Iraqi poet of the fourteenth century: \\"And in making moulds [·π≠arsh] from tin for turning out amulets and charms, how often has my hand written on the mould in the script of Syriac and then that of phylactery-writing!\\" That ·π≠arsh were sometimes carved or cast in Syriac and Hebrew (\\"phylactery-writing\\") is evidence that the prints were intended to impress illiterate people with their magical power rather than to be read.

It was derived from the Ababil-50 MLRS. Development During August 1991 Iraq started a program to develop the J-1 SSMs based on the S-75 Dvina SAM, later on structural similarities would be observed between the Fahad missiles that would later be released and the J-1 missiles. Iraq would then commence another program to develop a missile that could deleiver a 300 kg payload with a range of 150 km and a CEP of 150 m for guided Al-Fat'h and 750 m for unguided Al-Fat'h. By 1994 however the guided missiles programs would split and the solid-propellant one would retain its name of Ababil-100 however the liquid propelled version would later on become the Al-Samoud. The Ababil-100 would inherit many properties from the Ababil-50 MLRS developed in collaboration with Yugoslavia during the 1980s. Iraq had lacked the required material for the motor case as well as the airframe and thus encountered difficulties in forming and aligning cylindrical shapes required for motor cases resulting in decreased accuracy. Iraq also lacked mixers and bowls required for mixing the propellant as they had already been used for the Badr-2000 cruise missile project and thus frequency of motor accidents increased. Iraq had reportedly imported gyroscopes and accelerometers from Belarus for its guided version, it was estimated that the Inertial guidance system for the guided version would allow the missile to achieve a CEP of 150 m at 150 km range. Characteristics The Al Fat'h was a solid-propellant ballistic missile having a length of 6.7 m and a diameter of 0..5 m yet a 1.4 m diameter with fins. It weighed 1200 kg and utilized a motor weighing 770-856 kg and carried a payload mass of 260-300 kg with a 160-170 kg HE warhead and carried propellant weighing up to 828 kg. In the words of a UN inspector it was a \\"Badr-2000 Junior\\". The missile probably used the rocket engine of Condor-I (Alacran). The airframe was made of 4 mm thick 30CrMoV9 steel sheet. The Al-Fat'h missile was designed to be launched from the S-75 Dvina TEL and was mounted in a storage box with an integrated rail launcher. The unguided version was simply Fin stabilized however the guided version would use a complex system of Actuators and Canards with indigenous computers yet imported gyroscopes and accelerometers composing its INS. Although the HE warhead of this missile was the same as that used in the Al-Samoud missile however the submunition warhead was the KB-1 submunition which was used in Ababil-50, it operated a barometric fuze. The Unguided missile would carry 850-900 submunitions, each submunition weighing 30 g and the submunitions would be dispersed at the height of 2¬±0.5 km. The missiles range was greater than 150 km. The Al-Fat'h system had a high failure rate with 30% ending in failure and 10% of motors experiencing catastrophic failure during firing. Operational History Aftermath of the Ababil-100 missile attack on 7 April The guided version was ready for testing just before the Iraq war however it could not be tested, the Iraqis also had a plan to extend the range of this missile to 200 km however this could not be achieved. 50 individual test firings took place between 2000 and 2002 in which 17 were static motor tests and 33 were flight tests. The unguided version failed to achieve the desired CEP of 750 m. During the Iraq War Iraq fired 12 to 16 of these missiles. The Maximum tested range of the missile was 161 km yet sources suggest that the real range was greater had the Coalition forces not intercepted the missile. The Headquarters of the 2nd Brigade, US 3rd Infantry Division, were struck by an Ababil-100 missile on April 7, while the Brigade's main force was conducting an incursion 15 km north, well inside Baghdad. Three soldiers and two foreign reporters were killed in the blast.

As Farhat would do in all the programmes, before this programme too she had informed the local police station. Her journalist friends picked the news and soon ‚ÄòMuslim women entering the mosque‚Äô was all over the media. Around 100 women who had finished the training programme were ready to offer namaz in the mosque. The mosque authorities then allowed only 5 women, which Farhat politely refused as they were more in number, hence the women offered namaz under the shamiana itself. Farhat told the media that they were not offering namaz inside the mosque because the mosque was too small to accommodate all the women who had come for the programme. When the journalists met the mosque head, the mosque authority developed a cold feet and backed out saying that they did not give permission to anyone for offering namaz inside the mosque or in the shamiana and that Farhat and her team had forcibly entered the Masjid. This became a huge issue and a fatwa was passed against her. Anjuman-Islamia Ahle Sunnat-o-Jammat, the apex body of the Muslim community in the city issued a fatwa to all the 33 mosques in the city to stop women from praying at public places, in spite of the fact that Muslim women are not barred from praying in public by the Shariat. However the practice is generally discouraged in India. But in big mosques, there are separate enclosures for women which again are seldom used. In 2020, 13 years after this incident had taken place in Cuttack, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, the leading body of Muslim opinion in India declared that women can enter mosques, stating that Islam allows it's women to pray in mosques.

Surviving remains include two churches, olive presses, and likely dwellings, all probably constructed in the 5th and 6th centuries CE. In 2011, the village was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of the Dead Cities.  Location  Ksejbe sits on a hilltop at the northeastern edge of the Jebel Barisha. The hilltop used to be flat, but archeological ruin has left the ground uneven. Ksejbe is visible from the large Plain of Sermeda. To the north of Ksejbe lies the village of Sergible (ÿ≥ÿ±ÿ¨ÿ®ŸÑÿß‚Äé), in Jebel Halaqa, and to the east stands the dome of Jebel Sheikh Berekat. Ksegbe lies near the large road between Antioch and Qinnasrin, near present-day Aleppo.  Archaeological remains  What remains in Ksejbe include a large and small church, on the east and west edges of town, respectively, as well as olive presses and unidentified buildings. The large church is located at the top of the village‚Äôs eastern slope. The church‚Äôs south fa√ßade still stands, including its two ornate entrances, but the north, east, and west ends have fallen. It was constructed in 414 CE, as inscribed on the lintel above the church‚Äôs southeastern entrance. The inscription also includes the name of the architect, Markianos Kyrillas, and is surrounding by moldings designed with elaborate geometric and foliage motifs. The church has a standard basilica plan consisting of a nave with a five-column-long arcade on either side separating the two side aisles. The interior columns and arches have all fallen and now lie in the nave. Each capital of the arcade is unique and is paired with a matching capital across the nave in the other arcade. The capital designs vary from Corinthian to inverted fillets with discs, vertical grooves, or beaded basket-work. Between the southeastern column and its neighboring pillar are two reliquaries, one single and one double. On the eastern side of the south aisle, there is a baptistery, post-dating the church‚Äôs original construction), and a funerary chamber containing a tomb. An atrium frames the south side of the church. On the east side of the atrium is a two-story baptistery, and a small chamber with an entrance. The south side of the atrium has an open stoa of plain piers, which leads southward to a doorway. The west side of the atrium only has one entrance, whose doorway does not remain. The small church lies atop the western slope, southwest of the main group of village buildings. It was constructed in the 6th century. The church is square in plan, with entrances on the south and west sides. Today, the south, west, and part of the eastern fa√ßade remain. The church‚Äôs east end is rectangular and is flanked by square chambers. The nave has four narrow arches on each side, its columns topped with Corinthian capitals.

Monnet is a brand of cognac associated with the Monnet family. The latter's most famous member, Jean Monnet, worked for the family firm in his youth before the outbreak of World War I, and again briefly in the mid-1920s after resigning from the League of Nations in December 1923. Throughout his life he often made references to the formative role of the cognac industry, which involves patience (since the product must age for years before being marketed) and addresses a global clientele, in shaping his beliefs and world view. Advertisement for Monnet Cognac by Leonetto Cappiello, 1927 History The firm's origin go back to 1838 and the creation that year of the Soci√©t√© des Propri√©taires Vinicoles de Cognac (SPVC), a cooperative endeavor of independent Cognac producers aiming at marketing their product directly to international clients and bypassing the dominant market power of established houses such as Hennessy or Martell. The Soci√©t√© soon sold the brandy under the SPVC brand, and prospered during much of the 19th century. For nearly six decades the SPVC was led by members of the Salignac family, but in 1897 it dismissed them and chose as its new head Jean-Gabriel Monnet, a former employee of the rival Pellisson cognac producer and Jean Monnet's father. J.-G. Monnet subsequently appeared as a brand alongside SPVC in 1901. The brand's symbol from inception in 1838 was a salamander. This echoed both the cognac production process (as that animal is reputed to survive in fire, evoking the heating phase of distillation) and the local history, since the salamander was also on the arms of the royal house of Valois-Angoul√™me and of its most famous scion Francis I, born in Cognac in 1494. During the 1950s Monnet became the official cognac supplier of the royal court of Sweden, and one of the top 10 cognacs in the United States. Control of the company remained in the Monnet family until 1962, when it was sold to the Rhineland- based winery. It was then acquired by brandy producer Asbach in 1987, which in turn sold it to Hennessy in 1991. Hennessy then sold Monnet in 1992-93 to another of its brands, Hine, and in 2003 sold Hine (and thus also Monnet) to Angostura while retaining ownership of the original production facility. Today, Monnet cognac is sold mostly in Asia, Russia, and the Nordic countries. Former production facility chai-cath√©drale\\" in Cognac, 2006 The Monnet cognac production facilities were initially built from 1838 to 1848 by the SPVC and covered more than 50,000 square meters, including the chais, cooper's workshop, production workshop, and office. There were still 30 employees working there in 1986. Production stopped in 2004, and in 2006 LVMH sold it to the Cognac municipality. After a decade of neglect, British businessman Javad Marandi purchased the site in July 2016 and redeveloped it as a luxury hotel, designed by Paris-based architect Didier Poignant and opened in 2018 as Hotel Chais Monnet.

Each oral history is complimented by a portrait in which the Vietnam veteran holds an object of some significance such as a newspaper clipping, a legal document, a book, or photograph. The large black and white photographs allow readers to see the veteran while reading the brief but moving oral histories to learn why they turned against the Vietnam War. The veterans' stories and portraits were collected over a five year period and have been exhibited throughout the United States, Vietnam, Japan and Australia. A number of them were also included in the book Waging Peace in Vietnam: U.S. Soldiers and Veterans Who Opposed the War edited by Ron Carver, David Cortright, and Barbara Doherty. It was published in September 2019 by New Village Press. Contents A Matter of Conscience Installation at the Addison Gallery of American Art 1992 The book contains 27 interviews collected from 1987 to 1992 with accompanying black and white photographs of each Vietnam veteran. A number of the subjects in the book were well known GI resisters during the war, including Carl Dix, one of six GIs who in June 1970 refused orders to Vietnam in the largest mass refusal of direct orders to Southeast Asia who became known as the Fort Lewis Six; Donald W. Duncan, a U.S. Army Special Forces (Green Beret) Master Sergeant who became one of the earliest opponents of the war and one of the antiwar movement leading public figures; Captain Howard Levy, an Army doctor who was court-martialed for refusing an order to train Green Beret medics on their way to Vietnam; Susan Schnall who in 1968, while a U.S. Navy Lieutenant, dropped antiwar leaflets over military bases and an aircraft carrier from a small plane and then, while in uniform, held a press conference and lead a mass peace march; Andy Stapp, known for organizing the American Servicemen's Union, an unofficial union for the U.S. military, in opposition to the Vietnam War; Keith Mather and Randy Rowland, two of the GIs involved in the Presidio mutiny, and Roger Broomfield, one of Presidio mutineers' guards in the military stockade. While many of the others in the book are lesser know, all together the well known and those known mainly by their friends and family represent a much larger demographic of GIs in the Vietnam era who resisted the war. The authors say they \\"represent only a fraction of the stories of GI resistance that might be told\\" and quote Defense Department figures that \\"as many as 503,926 incidents of desertion occurred between July 1, 1966 and December 31, 1973; compared with 191,840 reported cases of men refusing draft induction between 1963 and 1973.\\" The stories and images come from every branch of the U.S. military, most during the Vietnam era and a few from the Gulf War era. =Marines= We hear from Marines like Paul Atwood who expressed a deep fear of where he saw patriotism lead \\"into mindless, unquestioning, uncritical acceptance of policy by governmental leaders\\". He bluntly concluded, \\"A more fucked up war couldn't be imagined.\\" Atwood's photo shows him holding his ribbons and dog tags which he once felt stood for something good and now were \\"a symbol of its opposite.\\" Howard Levy photo by William Short from A Matter of Conscience And Steve Fournier who witnessed \\"Marines cutting ears and penises off enemy bodies and displaying them proudly.\\" He \\"saw an eight-year-old boy shot in the leg for saying, 'Fuck you Marine,' and an 80-year-old woman beaten by a marine with his rifle butt.\\" He describes coming home and going to his first antiwar demonstration where he apologized to the crowd for previously disparaging them. He told them he thought they were doing \\"something wonderful\\" and said he was proud to be with them. He received a \\"wonderful ovation\\" and felt \\"God, I'm home, I'm finally home.\\" Clarence Fitch recalled being influenced by the black \\"consciousness\\" and \\"black power movement\\" of the times. He said the black Marines segregated themselves in Vietnam, \\"we didn't want to integrate into what we considered the white man's war.\\" He started looking at the enemy, \\"not so much as the enemy, but as another minority, brown people.\\" In his photo he is wearing his Vietnam Veterans Against the War t-shirt. =Army= Donald Duncan photo by William Short from A Matter of Conscience Captain Howard Levy became one of the most well known GI resisters during the Vietnam War when he refused to train combat medics. His photo radiates this defiance as we see him, arms crossed with a determined look on his face. During his court-martial he recalls trying \\"to put the war on trial, but the military court said the truth is no defense.\\" John Tuma was assigned to military intelligence and soon realized he was expected to participate in torturing the prisoners. When he refused and reported the use of a torture device he was transferred and then almost killed twice by his own side. His photo reveals a wiser and sadder man. Andy Stapp, who burned his draft card while a student at Penn State, may seem like an unlikely Army enlistee. And he was he agreed to be drafted in order to organize soldiers against the war. He gave the Army so much trouble they tried court-martialing and transferring him numerous times. In late 1967, he met with dissident GIs from nine different bases and started the American Servicemen's Union, which had ten demands, including an end to racism in the Army and the right to refuse illegal orders. His portrait shows him holding his autobiography Up Against the Brass and an Esquire magazine cover story about the Union. Carl Dix photo by William Short from A Matter of Conscience Carl Dix, a black man from Baltimore, recalls arriving at Fort Bragg in North Carolina and seeing a big sign outside the base \\"Welcome to KKK Country\\". He was influenced by the \\"developing black consciousness\\" and especially Malcolm X who spoke against black Americans going to oppress the Vietnamese when they were being oppressed at home. He also read about police murdering Black Panther members in Chicago and Los Angeles and realized there was a war in the U.S. too. He knew he had to decide what side he was on. \\"I decided I couldn't be a part of the war in Vietnam. I couldn't go fight for America.\\" In his photo he holds The Autobiography of Malcolm X in one hand and Mao Zedong's Little Red Book in the other while he wears a t-shirt with a large image of Mao on the front. Green Beret Master Sergeant Donald Duncan spent 10 1/2 years in the U.S. Army before publicly announcing \\"I quit\\" on the cover of Ramparts Magazine. \\"The administration and the Generals were deceiving the American people and betraying its troops.\\" His photo shows him holding that fateful issue of Ramparts along with his autobiography The New Legions. Dave Cline recalls reading Donald Duncan autobiography The New Legions while recovering from an NVA bullet through his knee. Duncan \\"basically wrote we're fighting on the wrong side\\" \\"it made a lot of sense to me\\". He returned home to organize other GIs against the war and join Vietnam Veterans Against the War. He is pictured holding the Fort Hood GI underground newspaper Fatigue Press. Returning from Vietnam, Skip Delano was \\"very committed to fighting this whole machine that sent us there\\". He co-founded Left Face, the GI underground newspaper at Fort McClellan in Alabama and was one of 1,366 active-duty servicemen who signed an antiwar petition printed in The New York Times on November 9, 1969. In his photo he wears a button saying \\"To Hell with Rambo and all He Represents\\" and holds copies of Left Face. Dave Blalock's photo shows him holding the full page in NY Times petition which Skip Delano had signed. He tells how seeing this led him, with several other guys in the 1st Cav, to organize the other GIs in their unit in Vietnam to wear black armbands. At the next morning's formation all the enlisted men and some of the doctors and helicopter pilots were wearing armbands - the commanding officer was so shocked he gave the whole unit the day off. The picture of Terry Irvin shows him holding a GI underground newspaper called Free Press and a copy of the U.S. Declaration of Independence. And therein lies his story. He and other GIs had been trying unsuccessfully to get approval to distribute Free Press on Fort Lewis and McChord Air Base. In protest, about a dozen soldiers and some civilian supporters went to the base on the Forth of July 1971 and distributed copies of the Declaration of Independence. Soon the military police showed up and arrested all the GIs. When it made national news that soldiers had been arrested for passing out he Declaration on the Fourth, all their charges were quietly dropped. =Navy and Air Force= Susan Schnall photo by William Short from A Matter of Conscience Susan Schnall signed on as a Navy nurse to provide good care for the young kids being \\"sent overseas and shot\\". She soon realized she was no longer just \\"patching up people\\" she was \\"promoting the war machine.\\" She had read about B-52 bombers dropping leaflets on the Vietnamese and decided to do the same at home. Her portrait shows her holding some of the leaflets she dropped over San Francisco military bases from an airplane. She knew Navy regulations prohibited speaking politically while in uniform, but reasoned, \\"if General Westmoreland can wear his uniform before Congress asking for money for Vietnam, I can wear mine...speaking out against the war. I had as much right to freedom of speech as he does.\\" Charlie Clements graduated 2nd in his class in 1967 at the Air Force Academy. He flew more than 50 C-130 missions over Southeast Asia until the U.S. began covert military operations in Cambodia. While on a secret mission over Cambodia he looked out his plane and saw \\"vast areas that looked like the moon.\\" He realized the U.S. was \\"conducting massive bombing operations there\\" and refused to fly anymore. =Gulf War= The portraits of three GI resisters from the Gulf War are included in the book. There stories are not told in detail but are described as similar to \\"those given by veterans who opposed the Vietnam War.\\" Reception The American Book Review described the photos as having \\"a powerful cumulative effect\\", one that emphasizes \\"the vulnerability and dignity of a class of people who are often stereotyped as mere servants of our nation's war machine.\\" The University of Washington Press commented that dissent \\"within the military's own ranks is a powerful chapter in the history of war\\" and felt the book, \\"by examining it may help us better understand why the Vietnam War continues to haunt our nation.\\" The On Guard reviewer says the book is \\"a spare but amazingly complete 'look' at the GI resistance movement, presented in a beautiful, dignified way.\\" In 1992 the book was awarded First Place in the American Association of Museums annual Publications Design Competition. The touring exhibit of the photos and histories has also garnered positive reviews. A reviewer for The Boston Globe noted the \\"haunting atmosphere of the work\\" and said it was \\"almost palpable.\\" The Boston Globe also selected the exhibit for its \\"Critic's Tip\\" and called it \\"remarkable\\". Z Magazine said, \\"The black-and-white portraits stare unflinchingly out at the viewer...the viewer is being interrogated by the power of the witnesses' gaze the notorious thousand-mile stare.\\" See also * Carl Dix * Concerned Officers Movement * Court-martial of Howard Levy * Court-martial of Susan Schnall * Donald W.

Development The design was initiated at the request of a friend of Bob Barrows, who was looking for a Barrows Bearhawk, but with greater capacity. Barrows completed the drawings and the builder started construction of the design, until health issues caused him to abandon the project. A year later, Mark Goldberg, president of Avipro/Bearhawk Aircraft, described the incomplete project to Collin Campbell of Bolivar, Missouri, who was looking for a new building project, after having built several Bearhawk designs in the past. Campbell agreed to complete the prototype and it first flew on 3 May 2020. By 21 May 2020 the prototype had completed five hours of test flying. Design Based on the Barrows Bearhawk, the new design is wider, with a cabin longer and an overall length longer. The stretched cabin permits the installation of a fifth and sixth seat or additional baggage. The aircraft features a strut-braced high-wing, a five or six seat enclosed cabin accessed by doors that is wide, fixed conventional landing gear and a single engine in tractor configuration. The aircraft fuselage is made from welded steel tubing covered in doped aircraft fabric, with the wings of aluminum construction. The wings are identical to the original Bearhawk design. Its span wing employs a Riblett airfoil, has an area of and mounts flaps.

Her father, Algernon Borthwick, 1st Baron Glenesk, had owned the paper and revived its fortunes. He died in 1908, and control of the paper passed to Lady Bathurst. She led the paper as the only female owner of a major newspaper in the world, reorienting it to focus on political and diplomatic affairs. The paper continued to be highly successful and respected under her ownership; it was considered an organ of the Conservative Party and contributed to the fall of Arthur Balfour and David Lloyd George from power. Lord Northcliffe, one of Lady Bathurst's competitors and the owner of The Times, wrote that she was \\"the most powerful woman in England, without exception other than royalty\\". She sold the paper in 1924 and lived in relative obscurity before dying in 1965 at the age of 94.  Personal life  Lilias Margaret Frances Borthwick was born on 12 October 1871 to Algernon Borthwick, 1st Baron Glenesk, and Alice Beatrice, the daughter of Thomas Lister, on Eaton Place in London. She married Seymour Bathurst, 7th Earl Bathurst on 15 November 1893. They had four children; three sons and a daughter. She lived with her husband on Saint Helena during the Boer War as he was in command of the garrison on the island. She wanted to purchase Longwood House, where Napoleon had lived in exile, but never did. When her father died, she inherited his house in Piccadilly but sold it and moved to Bruton Street.  The Morning Post  Early experience = Her father, Lord Glenesk, was the owner of The Morning Post and had restored the paper. He trained her brother Oliver Borthwick to take over the paper, but her brother died in 1905. Upon his death, Lady Bathurst became involved in the paper in 1905. That same year Fabian Ware became editor of The Morning Post. Shortly after beginning work, Ware came into conflict with Glenesk, who thought he should promote tariff reform less, and Ware wrote asking Lady Bathurst to intervene and threatening to resign. When Glenesk died in November 1908, she became the owner of the paper. Although Spenser Wilkinson, the paper's lead writer, attempted to turn her against Ware, Ware eventually became Lady Bathurst's favorite editor. When Lady Bathurst took ownership of the newspaper, it was reported that she was the only woman newspaper owner at the time in London, and by some papers that she was the only woman in the world to own a major newspaper. She heavily focused The Morning Post on political and diplomatic affairs and was a serious Catholic and Conservative. Borthwick played a large role in dictating the paper's policies. In 1922, it was written that \\"no line of importance is admitted to the columns without her 'O.K. The Dictionary of National Biography (DNB) wrote that Borthwick considered her main principles to be \\"loyalty to the crown, to the church, and to every cause which was honourable and right\\". Under her ownership, the paper was imperialist, protectionist, militaristic, anti-semitic, and opposed Home Rule for Ireland, socialism, women's suffrage and communism. The DNB concludes the paper was \\"general die-hard\\". The paper served as the organ of the Conservative party and was considered refined and aristocratic under her ownership. In 2014 Harry Defries wrote that \\"The Morning Post represented the extreme right of Conservatism and its hostility towards Jews was extreme\\". In response to the perceived military deficiency of the United Kingdom and Germany's successful test of a Zeppelin, The Morning Post announced the creation of a National Airship Fund on 21 June 1909. The aim of the fund was to raise ¬£20,000 through public subscription to purchase the United Kingdom an airship. Lady Bathurst contributed an initial ¬£2,000 to the fund. In July, Ware travelled to Paris and commissioned Lebaudy Fr√®res to build the Lebaudy Morning Post. In August, it was revealed that the Daily Mail had offered to pay for a hangar while an airship from Cl√©ment-Bayard was shipped to England. Ware rushed to ensure the Morning Posts airship arrived first, and by May 1910 he began helping plan the airship's route to England. However, on 16 October 1910, the Cl√©ment-Bayard No.2, sponsored by The Daily Mail, arrived in England. The War Office purchased the airship and the National Airship Fund was left out of negotiations. The airship commissioned by The Morning Post was damaged when it arrived in England ten days after the Cl√©ment-Bayard No.2, its hangar was too small, and it crashed on its first test flight. Ware was accused of financial mismanagement and poorly managing the paper. After threatening to sue L. J. Bathurst, the paper's manager and Lady Bathurst's brother-in-law, over libel, he was given ¬£3,000 and agreed to retire. His retirement was announced on 14 June 1911. = Later experience = Upon the recommendation of Rudyard Kipling, she appointed H. A. Gwynne editor of the paper in 1911. She stayed informed about important matters of the paper and generally supported Gwynne. Her father had been very successful running the paper; he developed a system to accept payment for coverage in social columns; was earning an estimated $500,000 per year for the paper by 1914. That year, The New York Times described the Morning Post under his control as \\"a capably conducted newspaper in all respects, conservative in its methods, and retaining possibly more editorial influence than any other London newspaper\\". The New York Times considered that Lady Bathurst ran the paper \\"with a success equal to her fathers\\". In May 1914 Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe, the owner of The Times, reduced the price of his newspapers to one penny, beginning a 'newspaper war' with The Morning Post, The Telegraph, and The Standard, which all published at that price. It was thought that The Morning Post had the weakest hold on circulation, and would be targeted by Lord Northcliffe. He wrote that the Post was \\"a paper which has the unique distinction of voicing the views of a very gifted lady\\". The war began with advertisements published in the papers. Borthwick refused to allow The Times to advertise their price reduction in The Morning Post. She continued to fight the Northcliffe for years. Borthwick was briefly a nurse in France during the First World War and helped various war charities. In 1918 Gwynne and Charles √† Court Repington, the war correspondent for The Morning Post during the conflict, were fined $500 dollars each for publishing an article that criticised the Lloyd George ministry. Lady Bathurst supported Repington and Gwynne for publishing the story. In July 1920, The Morning Post published The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a fabricated antisemitic text purporting to describe a Jewish plan for global domination, with no commenting. H. A. Gwynne had sent the document to Lady Bathurst before publication. In 1920, she founded the British League of Help for the Devastated Areas of France and Belgium.British League of Help and Worcester's Adoption of Gouzeaucourt In a 1922 article, The Outlook called her \\"the world's greatest woman newspaper owner\\". Lord Northcliffe called her \\"the most powerful woman in England, without exception other than royalty\\". In 1922, Lord Midleton was offended by a story he read in the newspaper. He accosted Lady Bathurst, and she refused to apologise. When David Lloyd George fell from power in late 1922, Hayden Church for the McClure Newspaper Syndicate wrote that \\"with the exception of Andrew Bonar Law himself, and perhaps not even excepting the present Prime Minister, no single individual played a greater part in precipitating the crisis that drove David Lloyd George from office than did Lady Bathurst through her famous journal, the 'Morning Post'\\". She was also credited with helping decrease the power of Arthur Balfour through creating a 'Balfour Must Go' movement. After circulation had fallen dramatically, in December 1922 she decided to sell the paper, assigning her son Allen Bathurst, Lord Apsley, to handle the negotiations. Negotiations with Rupert E. Beckett of The Yorkshire Post began in 1923, but were unsuccessful. On 7 April 1924 the paper was sold to Alan Percy, 8th Duke of Northumberland, and a consortium of prominent Conservatives for ¬£500,000 (¬£ in ). After selling the paper she lived in relative obscurity, helping her son politically. Allen Bathurst died in 1942 and Seymour Bathurst the following year. She died on 30 December 1965 at the age of 94 in Chesterton, Gloucestershire.

It was the first soap opera produced in the Kazakhstan. It became the most popular TV program in Central Asia, reportedly reaching 60 million homes in four countries: Russia, Uzbekistan, China and Kazakhstan. It is still unmatched in viewership and duration among Kazakhstani TV shows. The show was funded by a British government program to transfer knowledge to countries in the former Soviet Union and to promote the transition to a market economy. The story line revolves around two families, the working-class Kazakh Umarovs and the professional-class Russian Platonovs. Their families are joined through marriage of the Umarovs' daughter to the Platonovs' son. It was recognized as the best series of 1998 at the CIS media forum. A sequel to the series titled Crossroads in Astana started in 2015 on Khabar TV, the same station that aired the original.

The Fund's charter was to aid command-driven socialist societies' transition to free-market economies after the fall of the Soviet Union. In November 1992, the organization created the Marshall Plan for the Mind (MPM), named after the American plan to aid Western Europe rebuild after World War II. Crossroads was one of dozens of radio and TV programs the MPM funded in the former Soviet Union. It was conceived as an elaboration of an MPM radio soap opera in Russia, Dom Sem‚Äô Pod‚Äôezd Chetyre (Apartment 7, Entrance 4). That show was based on the long-running British TV radio soap The Archers, which had been an enormous success. Portobello Media, a private London-based production company, was chosen to co-produce the series with KazakhFilm at the latter's studios in Almaty. The show was intended to be a British-style social realist soap opera modeled on EastEnders, an extremely successful British soap about a working-class family in the East End of London. The Know-How Fund spent $2.25 million to produce the first 12 episodes. (Several British brands such as Lucky Strike, Wrigley's Gum, and Smirnoff vodka also paid for product placement.) The funds paid for both Kazakhstani staff and experienced British soap opera consultants to train them. The consultants were set builders, set designers, scriptwriters, and editors, among others. The scripts were to depict the goings-on of a market economy, \\"incorporating issues such as privatization, banking, entrepreneurship, and market reform into the story lines\\". Most of the scripts were to be filmed in privately owned enterprises and one of the main characters ran a small cafe. At the outset, the project attracted the attention of Almaty's writers, actors, and artists. It promised prestige and high wages in the post-Soviet era, when jobs were hard to come by. After joining, the Kazakhstanis were \\"trained in costumes, makeup, props, sound, production, lighting, directing, film editing, acting, assisting, and cost accounting\\". The writers were introduced to staples of British soap opera such as the \\"cliff-hanger, story-lining, narrative, [and] open-endedness\\". After a few months, the British chose who they thought were the best writers and let the rest of them go. Those who did not make the cut were often resentful, with at least one writer penning a scathing indictment of the production in a magazine, alleging corruption and incompetence. During the training period, the writers and their trainers conflicted over the representation of Kazakh characters (the Kazakh writers resented that the Russian Platonovs were doctors, representing respectability, whereas the Kazakh Umarovs were working- class and folksy); whether intermarriage between Kazakhs and Russians could work (the British arranged several inter-marriages between characters to promote inter-ethnic harmony, but the Kazakhstani writers ensured the mixed marriages had extensive marital problems, believing that such marriages could not work); choice of characters (the Kazakh writers added a detective character after the British left); the content appropriate for a soap opera (some writers resented writing for a soap opera, which they considered to be a lowly form, and one writer even tried to put in a character reading Nietzsche); and how much historical consistency mattered (the Kazakh writers thought the viewers would not notice inconsistencies). Some Kazakhstani actors were frustrated by the open-ended nature of soap opera scripts and demanded to know \\"the ending\\". In later years, the show was increasingly influenced by government policy and censors.

Believing that circulating air was bad, women were shut up in rooms were a fire was burned to heat the room, regardless of the weather, and any opportunity for circulating air was blocked off. Women were prohibited from drinking water or milk if they developed puerperal sepsis, out of concern for a purulent discharge.

They considered their emirate as the last remnant of the Ayyubid state. The rulers were called melik and continued to lead the emirate from 1232 to 1524 despite invasions and different sovereigns. Rock caves near Hasankeyf which the locals fled towards during the Timurid invasion. The period from the 13th century to the 16th century witnessed the construction of various architectural structures, mostly pertaining to Islamic architecture. Topographer Izz al-Din ibn Shaddad noted, arguably before 1259, that the emirate had three madrasas, four hammams, mausolea, bazaars, caravanserais, mosques and citadels. Around the citadel, there was a town square and fields for wheat, barley and grain growth. However, the living standard took a turn for the worse with the Timurid invasion with most of the local inhabitants fleeing towards the rock caves for safety. Even the Tigris bridge was unusable in this period. Only after a peace agreement was signed between Al-Nasir Muhammad and Abu Sa'id Bahadur Khan in the first part of the 14th century did the emirate prosper again and construction resumed. The emirate had established several charities which supported educational matters and scholars from the fields of music, poetry and literacy settled in the emirate. Several emirs also collected scholarly works and established libraries for research. History When Timur reached Hasankeyf, the melik of the emirate was Ashraf who submitted himself fully to the Timurid Empire. Melik Ashraf's rule is described as long and quiet. He was succeeded by his son Khalil who had the unanimous support from all tribes of Hasankeyf and he also pleaded his loyalty to the Timurid Empire who was now led by Timur's son Shah Rukh. When Shah Rukh was fighting the Qara Qoyunlu in Van, Melik Khalil also went to pay homage to the Timurid ruler. Melik Khalil's rule is described as a period of happiness and peace. When Melik Khalil died, he was succeeded by his nephew Khalf who went to war against the Kurdish tribes of Cizre. The rule of Melik Khalf would come to an end when Uzun Hasan of the Aq Qoyunlu besieged Hasankeyf. During this besiege, Melik Khalf was assassinated by a nephew who afterwards opened the gates to the invaders. The nephew did not get to rule the emirate which was handed over to a Turkish chieftain. The brother of Melik Khalf, Khalil, who had fled to Syria during the events, returned to Hasankeyf with the assistance of the Shirwi tribe whose chiefs worked as viziers for the emirate. Various tribes joined Khalil and they triumphed in taking over not only Hasankeyf but also Siirt from the Aq Qoyunlu. The new Melik Khalil now maintained full independence and he was incomparable with other rulers in Kurdistan. Nonetheless, he was taking prisoner and during a visit to the Safavid Shah Ismail I. The Qizilbash then took control over the emirate and handed over the area to Bejnewi tribe. However, Melik Khalil managed to escape during the Battle of Chaldiran in 1514 and united the people of Hasankeyf as he retook Siirt with Hasankeyf. The Bejnewi tribe was not persecuted but received a village in compensation for the killing of the father of their chieftain. The hereditary rule of the Emirate of Hasankeyf would come to an end with the death of Melik Khalil. The rivalry among his four sons dovetailed with tribal anger resulted in the hand-over of the emirate to Deli Husrev Pasha, the Ottoman governor of Diyarbakir. The Ottomans ultimately dissolved the emirate.

Severianus' life is known mainly from the writings of Damascius, including what was incorporated into the Suda and the Epitome of Photius. He was born into a prominent family of Damascus descended from Roman colonists who had once settled in Alexandria. His father was Auxentius and his grandfather Callinicus. His father wanted him to become a lawyer and to this end he specialised in Roman law while also studying poetry and rhetoric. His father refused his request to study philosophy under Proclus at the Athenian Academy, but after his father's death he went. Too ambitious for the professional philosophical life, Severianus entered politics. He rose to high office‚ÄîDamascius calls him an archon‚Äîbut he feuded with his superiors and was draconian in meting out justice. He blamed the short duration of his success in politics to a few unjustifiable death sentences. The office he held, unspecified by Damascius, was probably that of a provincial governor. He feuded with Aspar and Ardabur and these were probably the superiors mentioned elsewhere. Ardabur was magister militum for the East from 453 to 466. This suggests that his tenure fell within this period and lay in the East. After the abrupt end of his political career, Severianus returned to Athens. There Damascius met him in 469. He was offered a high post‚Äîprobably the praetorian prefecture of the East‚Äîby the emperor Zeno (474‚Äì491) on the condition that he become a Christian, but he refused. He had already gotten the worst of his dispute with the Christians Aspar and Ardabur because of his devout paganism. He showed the letter he received from Zeno to Damascius. He joined a plot to assassinate Zeno and restore paganism, but was betrayed by his co- conspirators, among whom was Aspar's youngest son, Herminericus. These events probably took place before 478, since Damascius left Athens for Alexandria that year and would have lost personal contact with Severianus. Severianus wrote numerous letters. He encouraged Damascius' brother Julian to study literature. He delivered commentaries on the speeches of Isocrates, praised by Damascius as true philosophy rather than sophistry.

The battery was mustered into Confederate service on December 28, 1861; many of the members of the battery had previously served in the Missouri State Guard. Assigned to the First Missouri Brigade, the battery saw action at the Battle of Pea Ridge and the Second Battle of Corinth in 1862. In 1863, the battery fought at the Battle of Grand Gulf, where Captain William Wade, first commander of the battery, was killed. The battery later saw action at the Battle of Champion Hill, Battle of Big Black River Bridge, and the Siege of Vicksburg. When the Confederates surrendered at the end of the Siege of Vicksburg, the men of the battery became prisoners of war. After a prisoner exchange, the men of the battery were combined with Landis's Battery and Guibor's Battery on October 3, 1863, and Wade's Battery ceased to exist as a separate unit. Service historyOrganization= Captain William Wade organized the battery in December 1861. Many of the batterymen had served in the Missouri State Guard before joining the battle; recruiting activities occurred at Osceola, Missouri and Springfield, Missouri. On December 28, the battery officially joined the Confederate States Army while at Springfield. After joining the army, the battery was assigned to the First Missouri Brigade and equipped with two 6-pounder guns and four 12-pounder howitzers. =1862=Pea Ridge Battle of Pea Ridge In early 1862, the battery was assigned to the forces of Major General Sterling Price; while under Price, the battery took part in a skirmish near Flat Creek, Missouri on February 15. On March 7 and 8, the battery was engaged at the Battle of Pea Ridge. At Pea Ridge, the battery was in Colonel Lewis Henry Little's brigade (the First Missouri Brigade) of Price's division of Major General Earl Van Dorn's Army of the West; also in Little's brigade were the 2nd Missouri Infantry, 3rd Missouri Infantry, 1st Missouri Cavalry, and Clark's Battery. Early on March 7, Wade's Battery, along with Clark's Battery and Guibor's Battery, engaged in an artillery duel with the 1st Iowa Battery. The Confederate cannons were able to silence the 1st Iowa Battery, which had several of its ammunition chests exploded. Early on March 8, Wade's Battery and Good's Texas Battery began firing at ranks of Union infantry which were preparing for a counterattack; however, this fire was not effective. In contrast, Union artillery began firing at the two Confederate batteries, inflicting casualties. Wade's Battery retreated in what historians William Shea and Earl J. Hess described as a \\"wild disorder.\\" When the Confederate position on the end of the battlefield where Wade's Battery was engaged collapsed, Wade's Battery was one of the last units to leave the field. Wade's Battery suffered nine casualties at Pea Ridge. Corinth In April, Wade's Battery was ordered across the Mississippi River. The battery was then moved to Corinth, Mississippi; a May 5 muster of the battery counted 107 men. Wade's Battery did not see action at either the May 9 Battle of Farmington or the Battle of Iuka on September 19. At the Second Battle of Corinth on October 3 and 4, Wade's Battery was assigned to Colonel Elijah Gates' brigade of Brigadier General Louis H√©bert's division of Price's corps of Van Dorn's Army of West Tennessee; Gates' brigade also included the 16th Arkansas Infantry, 2nd Missouri Infantry, 3rd Missouri Infantry, 5th Missouri Infantry, and the 1st Missouri Cavalry. On the first day at Corinth (October 3), Wade's Battery was positioned in front of the Confederate main line to shell Union infantry defending the outer defenses around Corinth; heavy Union fire quickly forced the battery to withdraw. The battery also participated in an artillery duel that also included Landis's Battery, Guibor's Battery, and Hiram Bledsoe's Battery. The combined Confederate cannons drove off Union artillery, allowing a Confederate infantry charge to occur. Later that day, a Union infantry force threatened Landis's Battery and Guibor's Battery; Wade's Battery helped repulse the threat. At Corinth, Wade's Battery suffered 20 casualties. In December, Captain Wade was promoted to the command of the artillery in Major General John S. Bowen's division; 1st Lieutenant Richard Walsh replaced Wade as commander of the battery. =1863= Battle of Grand Gulf In early 1863, the battery was transferred to the Vicksburg, Mississippi area, where it occupied a fortification known as Fort Wade. While at Fort Wade, the battery shelled passing ships of the Union Navy. The earlier guns of the battery had been replaced by 10-pounder Parrott rifles; one of these weapons burst on March 31, inflicting 10 casualties in the battery. Guibor's Battery was also stationed in Fort Wade. At the Battle of Grand Gulf on April 29, seven ironclad warships of the Union Navy bombarded Fort Wade and the nearby Fort Coburn. The guns of Fort Wade were silenced, but Fort Coburn continued firing. Towards the end of the fighting, Wade was killed. The battery suffered seven casualties in the battle. After Grand Gulf, the battery was temporarily placed on detached service, and missed the Battle of Port Gibson on May 1. Wade's Battery was attached to Francis Cockrell's brigade in John S. Bowen's division. On the morning of May 16, as part of the Battle of Champion Hill, the battery fought an artillery duel, destroying a Union artillery caisson. Later that day, Wade's Battery provided supporting fire for an attack by the First Missouri Brigade; when the attackers were forced to retreat, the battery helped provide covering fire. Wade's Battery lost five men at Champion Hill. On May 17, Wade's Battery formed part of a Confederate line guarding the crossing of the Big Black River. The horses assigned to the battery had been positioned on the other side of the river; when the Confederate line broke, the men of Wade's Battery were unable to withdraw their guns. They were forced to spike their cannons before joining the retreat. After reaching the defenses of Vicksburg, the men of the battery were assigned a new weapona 32-pounder rifled cannon. During the Siege of Vicksburg, many of the men of Wade's Battery engaged in sharpshooting. Beginning in late June, they began digging a tunnel for the purpose of detonating a charge of gunpowder under the Union line, but the Confederate garrison surrendered before this could be completed. The battery lost seven men during the siege; by the time of the surrender on July 4, only 52 men were left. They were paroled and reported to Demopolis, Alabama. After being exchanged, the battery was combined with Landis's Battery and Guibor's Battery on October 3; Wade's Battery ceased to exist as a separate unit.

The route serves a total of 13 railway stations. History The Djerring Trail was built as a part of the Level Crossing Removal Project, that removed all level crossings between Caufield and Dandenong by raising the rail. 12 kilometres of the new shared path was built, along with existing paths merged into the new ones to form the Djerring Trail. In early 2018, a community vote was held to determine the name of the new path, some alternative options being Kerrboo onool Trail, Urban Parkland Trail, and Eucalyptus Trail. Over 1800 votes were counted. On 26 September 2018, it was revealed that the name 'Djerring trail' had a clear win, taking 30% of the total vote, and its counterpart 'Djerring Rail Trail' came in second, which meant that the name 'Djerring' was clearly preferred. While consultations of naming were taking place, construction began on the trail in early 2018 as well, alongside the removal of 9 level crossings across the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines.

De Biase is an American neuroscientist and glial biologist as well as an Assistant Professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles. De Biase explores the diversity of microglia that exist within the basal ganglia circuitry to one day target regional or circuit-specific microglia in disease. De Biase‚Äôs graduate work highlighted the existence and roles of neuron-OPC synapses in development and her postdoctoral work was critical in showing that microglia are not homogenous within the brain parenchyma.  Early life and education  De Biase pursued her undergraduate degree at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. De Biase majored in Cellular, Molecular, and Developmental Biology and received her Bachelors of Science in 2003. After completing her degree at Yale, De Biase worked as a research technician in the lab of Eric Hoffman at the Children‚Äôs National Medical Center in Washington, D.C. De Biase explored gene expression changes in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in addition to characterizing various immune cell states. Along with the Hoffman Lab, De Biase explored the gene expression of T helper cells. She found that TH2 cells express the NKG2A and CD56 upon activation while TH1 cells do not. Following her time as a researcher technician, in 2005 De Biase pursued her graduate degree at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. De Biase completed her graduate training in neuroscience under the mentorship of Dwight Bergles. She explored the synapses and signaling between neurons and oligodendrocyte precursor cells. De Biase first characterized the expression patterns and roles of NG2+ oligodendrocyte progenitors in the mouse brain. She found that these NG2+ cells, which go on to form oligodendrocytes later in development, have a unique early expression of voltage gated sodium channels, ionotropic glutamate receptors, and they form synapses with glutamatergic neurons. She further found that these cells exhibited low amplitude spikes, but not action potentials and that later in their development, this spiking ability was lost as well as their synaptic input and glutamate receptors. Overall her early results showed that oligodendrocyte progenitors, through their glutamatergic synapses with neurons, are able to monitor neural activity early in development before transitioning into their oligodendrocyte identities. Next, De Biase explored the role of NMDARs on oligodendrocyte precursors (OPCs) in oligodendrocyte differentiation. When she knocked out NMDARs in OPCs, De Biase did not observe effects on differentiation or cell survival, but she did find significant changes in AMPAR expression, suggesting that NMDARs help to regulate AMPAR signalling with neighbouring axons in development. Overall, De Biase‚Äôs graduate work highlighted the novel roles and functions of previously unknown OPC-neuron synapses in development.  Career and research  De Biase completed her graduate training in 2011 and then pursued her postdoctoral work under the mentorship of Antonello Bonci at the National Institute on Drug Abuse. De Biase explored the diversity of microglial phenotypes across basal ganglia nuclei, which called into question prior hypotheses about the homogeneity of microglia in the central nervous system. Her discoveries in the Bonci Lab laid the foundation for her independent career and research program. In 2018, De Biase joined the faculty at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles. De Biase is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Physiology and is the principal investigator of the De Biase Lab. The research focus of the De Biase Lab is the development and functions of the diversity of microglia within the basal ganglia circuitry. Based on De Biase‚Äôs postdoctoral work, microglia appear to be specialized to different brain regions and neural circuits, which allows for specific development of therapies for neurological and psychiatric diseases that target circuit specific microglia based on their unique gene expression, functions, and roles in disease. The De Biase Lab uses high resolution imaging techniques, electrophysiological recordings of microglia, and gene expression analyses to probe microglia in their different circuits and states in the basal ganglia. = Diversity of microglia phenotypes = Since microglia originate from the same yolk sac progenitors, it has been thought that microglia are homogenous within the brain parenchyma. In probing the roles of microglia in the basal ganglia, De Biase called this hypothesis into question. She found that the anatomical features, lysosomal content, membrane properties, and transcriptomes of microglia differ across the basal ganglia nuclei. These regional differences in microglia phenotype were established within the second postnatal week and are reinforced by local environmental cues. Her findings suggest a critical role for circuit specific microglia contributing to the unique functions and roles of specific neural circuits in the brain. Following up this work in her own lab at UCLA, De Biase and her team explored the time course of microglia specialization and dynamics of microglia maturation across the mesolimbic neural circuits. They found that by the second postnatal week, microglia population numbers peak in nucleus accumbens (NAc) and by the third postnatal week they peak in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). The surge of microglia population expansion occurs on postnatal day 8, only once the microglia have tiled the brain in an even fashion. Microglia then undergo cell death to reach adult brain levels of microglia expression. Lastly, De Biase and her group observed that the regional differences in microglia expression begin around postnatal day 8. Overall, their results showed that during this time of divergence in microglial identity, microglia may play a highly active role in shaping neural circuits.

The unit, at times designated Commander of Reserve Troops XII/II (), 182nd Division (), Division No. 182 (), 182nd Replacement Division (), Division Nancy (), Division G√ºmbel, Division Karl, and 182nd Reserve Division (), was active between 1939 and 1945. The division was destroyed in the Caen area in early August 1944, then deployed in Slovakia in November of the same year.  History  A second command staff for Wehrkreis XII (Wiesbaden), designated Kommandeur der Ersatztruppen XII/II, was formed on 20 October 1939. This staff was redesignated 182. Division on 7 November 1939, then located in Litzmannstadt, and renamed again to become Division Nr. 182 on 23 December 1939. The division's initial commander was Friedrich Bayer, appointed on 19 October 1939. = Division Nr. 182 = The division consisted of the following elements in March 1940: * Infantry Replacement Regiment 79 (Battalions: 208, 212, 226), Litzmannstadt. * Infantry Replacement Regiment 246 (Battalions: 313, 352, 404), Pleschen. * Infantry Replacement Regiment 263 (Battalions: 463, 483, 485), Sieradz. * Artillery Replacement Regiment 34 (Detachments: 179, 246, 263), Ostrowo. * Pioneer Replacement Battalion 34, Leslau. On 24 April 1940, Bayer was replaced as divisional commander by Hans von Basse. On 10 August 1940, the division was deployed back to Koblenz in Wehrkreis XII. The divisional structure remained largely the same, with only one additional unit in the form of Marchine Gun Replacement Battalion 14 at Bitburg. Regiment 79 was moved to Koblenz, Regiment 246 to Trier, and Regiment 263 to Idar-Oberstein. The Artillery Replacement Regiment 34 and the Pioneer Replacement Battalion 34 were moved to Koblenz. On 30 May 1941, Basse was replaced as divisional commander by Franz Karl. On 15 July 1941, the division was moved from the Koblenz area to the vicinity Nancy in occupied France. Division No. 182 consisted of the following elements at that point: * Infantry Replacement Regiment 79 (Battalions: 208, 212, 226), Nancy. * Infantry Replacement Regiment 246 (Battalions: 313, 352, 404), Luxembourg City. * Infantry Replacement Regiment 263 (Battalions: 463, 483, 485), Commercy. * Infantry Replacement Regiment 342 (Battalions: 321, 697, 698), Verdun. * Artillery Replacement Regiment 34 (Detachments: 15, 179, 246, 263), Nancy. On 5 June 1942, Karl was replaced as divisional commander by Karl G√ºmbel. On 13 June 1942, the division was joined by Infantry Replacement Regiment 112 (Battalions: 110, 256, 437, 438), which had been redeployed from Darmstadt to Chalons. In exchange, the division passed Regiment 246 in Luxembourg City to Division No. 172. = 182nd Replacement Division (Division Karl, Division G√ºmbel) = On 10 July 1942, the alert units of the 182nd Division were called up and moved towards Draveil starting on 13 July. The resulting force was still officially designated Division Nr. 182, but concurrently also carried the titles 182. Ersatz-Division, and was further nicknamed Division G√ºmbel or Division Karl after the divisional commander at that time. Franz Karl returned to once again replace Karl G√ºmbel as divisional commander on 3 August 1942. In August 1942, the 182nd Division was put under the supervision of the XXV Army Corps, which was in turn under the 7th Army. = 182nd Reserve Division (Division Nancy) = Those parts of the division that had remained in the Nancy sector instead of deploying to Draveil were once again put under a staff titled Division No. 182 on 11 July 1942. That staff was renamed Division Nanzig on 1 September 1942 and again redesignated Division No. 462 on 15 October 1942. Paul Lettow took divisional command from Karl on 27 September 1942. Division No. 462 was split on 26 November 1942 as part of the reorganization of the Replacement Army, and the replacement units stayed with the 462nd, whereas the training units came to the 182nd Reserve Division. In December 1942, the 182nd Division was put under the LXXXII Army Corps of the 15th Army. It remained there until February 1943, before moving to the reserves of Army Group D until January 1944. On 5 December 1942, Otto Schilling replaced Lettow as divisional commander. In December 1943, the 182nd Reserve Division consisted of the following elements: * Reserve Grenadier Regiment 79 (Battalions: 208, 212, 226), Chalons-Sur-Marne. * Reserve Grenadier Regiment 112 (Battalions:Battalion 256, previously part of Regiment 112, was disbanded before December 1943. 110, 437, 438), Senlis. * Reserve Grenadier Regiment 263 (Battalions: 463, 483, 485), Gisors. * Reserve Grenadier Regiment 342 (Battalions: 321, 697, 698), Mantes-Gassicourt. * Reserve Artillery Regiment 34 (Detachments: 70, 105, 179), Meaux. * Reserve Machine Gun Battalion 14, Langres. * Reserve Division Supply Commander 1082, Gisors. On 20 January 1944, Reserve Grenadier Regiment 263 was disbanded and its three battalions were used for formations of various new units. Battalion 463 joined the 988th Regiment under the 276th Infantry Division, whereas Battalions 483 and 485 joined Regiments 981 and 982 respectively, both of which were part of the 272nd Infantry Division. Furthermore, Battalions 226 and 697 were taken out of Regiments 79 and 342 to be used for the formation of Division Wahn following an order of 28 January 1944. On 23 January 1944, the 182nd Reserve Division was moved to the Pas-de-Calais area, with new headquarters set up at Helfaut. The division was taken out of the army group reserves and given to the reserves of the 15th Army instead. On 25 March 1944, Richard Baltzer took command of the division, a post he would hold until the end of the war. The 182nd Reserve Division consisted of the following elements on 1 March 1944: * Reserve Grenadier Regiment 79 (Battalions: 208, 212), Bailleul. * Reserve Grenadier Regiment 112 (Battalions: 110, 437, 438), Pihen- l√®s-Gu√Ænes. * Reserve Grenadier Regiment 342 (Battalions: 321, 698), Wizernes. * Cossack Battalion 570, Saint-Venant. * Reserve Artillery Regiment 34 (Detachments: 70, 105, 179), Chateau d'Alenthun. * Reserve Machine Gun Battalion 14, Cassel. * Reserve Division Supply Commander 1082, Arques. Following an order from 30 July 1944 (in response to Operation Overlord), the 182nd Reserve Division was mobilized into the field army and subsequently destroyed by Allied forces in the Caen area. A reorganization into a Shadow Division of the 24th Aufstellungswelle that was ordered by Oberbefehlshaber West did not come to pass. Another planned reorganization into a 182nd Field Training Division, ordered by OKH on 20 August 1944, also failed to materialize. A full redeployment of the 182nd Division was scheduled to be conducted in Wehrkreis X (Hamburg) starting in October 1944, but the division was called to Slovakia ahead of the deployment's completion on 20 November 1944. Here, the division was to complete deployment in the Nitra area in Wehrkreis XVII (Vienna), using recruits from Wehrkreis XII (Wiesbaden). The division's structure in late 1944 was as follows: * 182nd Division HQ, Nitra. * Reserve Grenadier Regiment 79 (Battalions: 208, 212), Topoƒæƒçany * Reserve Grenadier Regiment 112 (Battalions: 110, 438), Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica. * Reserve Grenadier Regiment 342 (Battalions: 321, 698), Pritwitz. * Reserve Artillery Detachment 1082 (three batteries), Nitrianske Pravno. * Reserve Pioneer Company 1082, Heiligenkreuz. * Commander Division Supply Troops 1082, Nitra. = 182nd Infantry Division = On 1 April 1945, just over a month before German surrender, the 182nd Reserve Division became the 182nd Infantry Division. The Reserve Grenadier Regiments 79, 112, and 342 became the Grenadier Regiments 663, 664, and 665, respectively. Each of these regiments retained the strength of two battalions each. The Reserve Artillery Regiment 1082, at only one battalion, became the Artillery Regiment 1082. The division was in Slovakia when the war ended, under the command of LXXII Army Corps of the 8th Army under Army Group South. Baltzer was still divisional commander.  Noteworthy individuals  * Friedrich Bayer, divisional commander starting 19 October 1939. * Hans von Basse, divisional commander starting 24 April 1940. * Franz Karl, divisional commander starting 30 May 1941 and again starting 3 August 1942. * Karl G√ºmbel, divisional commander starting 5 June 1942. * Paul Lettow, divisional commander starting 27 September 1942. * Otto Schilling, divisional commander starting 5 December 1942. * Richard Baltzer, final divisional commander starting 25 March 1944.

Marrazzo is an American microbiologist. She is the director of the University of Alabama School of Medicine Division of Infectious Diseases and focuses on prevention of HIV infection using biomedical interventions. Marrazzo is also a fellow of the American College of Physicians and Infectious Disease Society of America. Early life Growing up in Dunmore, Pennsylvania, Marrazzo chose to get into a career with medicine because her mother was a nurse and her role model. She earned her undergraduate degree in biology from Radcliffe College and her medical degree from Jefferson Medical College. Marrazzo later completed residency training and chief residency in internal medicine at Yale-New Haven Hospital. Career Marrazzo joined the faculty at the University of Washington School of Medicine in 1995. While there, she co-founded the Lesbian/Bisexual Women‚Äôs Health Study with nurse practitioner Kathleen Stine after noticing an unusual amount of middle-aged women had abnormal Pap smears. The results of their findings secured them funding from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) to investigate the prevalence and routes of transmission of various STDs among lesbian and bisexual women. This led to a co-authored study titled Pap Smear Screening and Prevalence of Genital Human Papillomavirus Infection in Women Who Have Sex with Women, which found that out of 300 women in the Seattle area, 13 percent tested positive for HPV and 4 percent had pre-cancerous changes on a Pap test. The following year, she was elected a Fellow of the American College of Physicians. In 2005, Marrazzo co-authored a study with David N. Fredricks and Tina L. Fiedler titled Molecular Identification of Bacteria Associated With Bacterial Vaginosis, which focused on the causes of bacterial vaginosis. In 2008, Marrazzo was appointed a member of the Subspecialty Board on Infectious Disease by the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM), and four years later was named its chair. During this time, Marrazzo was elected a Fellow of the Infectious Disease Society of America and Bennett Lorber Visiting Professor at Temple University. From 2009 until 2012, Marrazzo conducted the VOICE (Vaginal and Oral Interventions to Control the Epidemic) Study through the Microbicide Trials Network. The study was a randomized, placebo-controlled trial which examined the effects daily use of oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate had on over 5,000 women from 15 sites in South Africa, Uganda and Zimbabwe. The final published paper failed to prove that oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) or of a tenofovir-containing vaginal microbicide gel was effective in lowering the risk of HIV. Considered an expert in the field of HIV prevention, Marrazzo was appointed a co-chair of an interdisciplinary panel of experts to create a guideline in achieving an AIDS- free generation. The guidelines, which were later published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, integrated evidence-based behavioral interventions for people with HIV or at high risk for HIV infection. Her efforts in HIV prevention earned her the 2015 American Sexually Transmitted Diseases Association (ASTDA) Achievement Award and appointment to chair of the American Board of Internal Medicine Council. In 2016, Marrazzo succeeded Edward Hook as director of the University of Alabama School of Medicine Division of Infectious Diseases. After stepping down as president of the International Society for STD Research, she was named to the Infectious Diseases Society of America board of directors. On October 23, 2019, she was named principal investigator of a three-year $3.5 million grant study from NIAID to test the effectivness the Bexsero vaccine has on protecting vulnerable populations from gonorrhea. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Marrazzo studied whether blood clots could result in the spread of the virus through the human body.
