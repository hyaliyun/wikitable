Life Philips Augustijn Immenraet was born in Antwerp as the son of a German piano builder who had immigrated to Antwerp. He was the older brother of the successful landscape painter Philips Augustijn Immenraet.Michael Angelo Immenraet at the RKD It is not clear with whom he trained but on the basis of his style he is often regarded as a painter from the school of Peter Paul Rubens. The Baptism in the Jordan, Unionskirche Immenraet married Maria Vergouwen, the sister of the paintress Johanna Vergouwen on 8 February 1661. The couple had three daughters. His wife died in 1664 upon giving birth to the third child.Jaarboek, The Museum, 2000, p. 50 Immenraet and his sister-in-law Johanna Vergouwen engaged in extensive legislation regarding the inheritance of his deceased wife. On 26 November 1665 he married Margaretha Corthals and after her death he married a third time with Maria Brouwers. He had four daughters and two sons from the three marriages.Max Rooses, Franz von Reber, Geschichte der Malerschule Antwerpens, M√ºnchen, 1880, p. 333 Immenraet is documented in The Hague in 1661. Here he paints a chimney piece for the 'Hofje van Nieuwkoop', a housing project for poor widows funded from the inheritance of Johan de Bruijn van Buijtewech, a rich citizen of The Hague. The chimney piece represents the double portrait of Odila en Philippine van Wassenaer, the nieces of van Buijtewech and two first governesses of the project.Hofje van Nieuwkoop en de kunst at the RKD The two young governesses are depicted as shepherdesses.Alison McNeil Keetering, The Dutch Arcadia: pastoral art and its audience in the Golden Age, Allanheld and Schram, 1983, p. 176 He was registered in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1663. The Visitation, Unionskirche He worked in Germany for a period where between 1673 and 1678. He was responsible together with his pupil or assistant Johann Caspar Bencard for 38 of the oil on canvas paintings decorating the ceiling of the Unionskirche, Idstein. Little is known about his later years except that he died in Utrecht. Work Michel Angelo Immenraet painted allegorical, history, religious and genre scenes as well as portraits. Aside from the painting cycle in the Unionskirche, Idstein not many of his works are known. The earliest known work by him is the Double portrait of Odila en Phillipine van Wassenaer as Shepherdesses of 1661 ('Hofje van Nieuwkoop', The Hague). The portrait depicts the two young governesses of het 'Hofje van Nieuwkoop' as shepherdesses in an Arcadian landscape. This type of idealized representation was in vogue in the Dutch Republic at the time. The best-known works from his oeuvre are the series of 38 paintings, which the realized with the assistance of Johann Caspar Bencard for the ceiling of the Unionskirche, Idstein. The commission was given by Johann of Nassau-Idstein (1603‚Äì77) who wished to turn the existing church into a Baroque \\"Predigt- und Hofkirche\\" (sermon and court church) after the Thirty Years' War. The Dutch painters Joachim von Sandrart and his nephew Johann von Sandrart also created paintings for the church.Evangelische Pfarrkirche (Unionskirche) at Denkmalpflege Hessen The difficulty for the artists was to create a language that corresponded to Lutheran sensitivities. The programme of works all represent scenes from the Bible without any depictions of saints as would typically have been the case in a Catholic church. The works represented the stories from the Bible as ever present, living realities. The Biblical figures are dressed in courtly Baroque garments. The painting of the \\"Visitation\\" shows Mary arriving with a servant who carries her cases on his head. Saint Elisabeth‚Äôs residence with its formal garden in the background resembles the Idstein residential palace of Johann of Nassau-Idstein, the construction of which was commenced in 1646.Graf Johannes von Nassau-Idstein at nassau-info.de The subjects and the use of Baroque optical illusionism in the paintings in the center of the ceiling are intended to make the viewer look up, from altar to the back: The Transfiguration, the Elevation of the Holy Cross, The Resurrection, The Deposition, The Ascension and The Vision of St. John on Patmos. Double portrait of Odila en Philippine van Wassenaer as Shepherdesses A number of Immenraet‚Äôs compositions for the Unionskirche were based on well-known works by Rubens. For instance The Wedding at Cana on the south wall is largely inspired by Rubens' painting The Feast of Herod which is in the collection of the National Gallery of Scotland in Edinburgh.Anordnung der Wand- und Deckenbilder in der Unionskirche Idstein (Layout of the wall- and ceiling-paintings in the Union Church, Idstein) at Evangelische Kirchengemeinde Idstein Hessen The Feast of Herod at the National Galleries of Scotland Online Collections The series of works were at the time regarded as a remarkably unique Baroque contribution to church decoration in Protestant Germany.G√∂bel, Karl G., Die Bildzyklen in der Idsteiner Stadtkirche (Unionskirche) und ihre Bedeutung, in: NassA 118 (2007), pp. 341‚Äì384 References  External links  * * Paintings in the Unionskirche Category:Flemish Baroque painters Category:Flemish portrait painters Category:Flemish history painters Category:Artists from Antwerp Category:Members of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke Category:1621 births Category:1683 deaths ","title":"Michael Angelo Immenraet"},{"id":"44659721","text":"Nikolai Vasenin (5 December 1919 ‚Äì 7 December 2014) was a Russian World War II veteran who fought in the French Resistance during the early 1940s.

She has been described by art historian Karen Stevenson as one of the core members of a group of artists of Pasifika descent who brought contemporary Pacific art to 'national prominence and international acceptance'. Background and education In 2000 Hastings-McFall graduated from the Manukau Institute of Technology with a Bachelor of Visual Arts majoring in Jewellery. Much of her work references her Samoan heritage, which she began learning about when she first met her father in 1992. Work Hastings-McFall's work has been informed by her experience of growing up within Pakeha culture and later learning about her Samoan heritage. Among the issues that inform her work are 'the effects of Christianity and colonialism in the Pacific, loss of culture, the transplantation of Pacific Islanders to large cities and the shaping of traditional culture to fit contemporary urban culture'. Although she began making jewellery, Hastings-McFall found within a few years that she needed to extend beyond this: > 'I found it [jewellery] brought up other things I wanted to explore. I was > really interested in jewellery, researching and exploring, but that led to > other things I couldn't do with jewellery. I wanted to make objects without > the whole conversation about body adornment. Today there are definitely > elements of jewellery and jewellery-making in my work. I don't deny it or > repress it. I've always been inclined to making objects about ideas.' Hastings-McFall's work often references cultural stereotyping of the Pacific through the use of everyday material objects. She makes frequent use of the flower lei, either buying cheap nylon lei and using the 'petals' to cover furniture and lightboxes, or making lei from non-traditional materials, such as the nylon thread used in weedeaters, or the fish-shaped soy sauce bottles that come with take-away sushi packs, which 'carry on the tradition of Pacific adoption of modern materials like plastic in customary forms as well as commenting on the economic traditions of Pacific Island peoples in urban Aotearoa New Zealand'. Karen Stevenson writes of Hastings-McFall's lei works: > Hastings-McFall finds much to parody in the contemporary lives of Pacific > Islanders as they encounter the stereotypes of the Western gaze. Hastings- > McFall's humour is the basis and inspiration for her Urban Lei Series. Using > McDonald's throwaways (MacLei), curtain nets (Nosy Neighbour Lei), weedeater > nylon (Islanders) and soy sauce containers (Too Much Sushi Lei), Hastings- > McFall addresses the lived island and urban realities of New Zealand. Along with artist Sofia Tekela-Smith, Hastings-McFall has also revisited the kapkap (a pendant form found in the Solomon Islands and the Marquesas), traditionally made from mother of pearl and tortoiseshell, but in Hastings- McFall's versions made from materials such a gold and computer disks, or mother of pearl and stainless steel. Exhibitions Hastings-McFall has exhibited extensively since 1994 and has received support from Creative New Zealand to produce work. Major New Zealand exhibitions include In Flyte, a survey exhibition at Pataka Art + Museum, Porirua (2013), Home AKL at Auckland City Art Gallery (2012), Oceania: Imagining the Pacific at City Gallery Wellington (2011), and Bottled Ocean curated by Jim Viviaeare, which toured New Zealand in 1994-1995. Her work has also featured in international exhibitions including Niu Pasifik: Urban Art from the Pacific Rim, Gorman Museum, UC Davis, (2010); Pasifika Styles, University of Cambridge (2006); and Paradise Now?, Asia Society Museum, New York (2004). =1 Noble Savage, 2 Dusky Maidens= In 1999 Hastings-McFall collaborated with jewellers Chris Charteris and Tekala-Smith on the exhibition 1 Noble Savage, 2 Dusky Maidens at Judith Anderson Gallery in Auckland, which helped draw attention to a new generation of New Zealand artists of Pacific descent and showed \\"what contemporary jewellers might offer to contemporary Pacific identity ‚àí notably a sense of playful appropriation of Pacific adornment that is ironic and serious at the same time\\". The exhibition was accompanied by a publication titled 1 Noble Savage, 2 Dusky Maidens with reproductions of the three artists' work and essays by Mark Kirby, Lisa Taouma and Nicholas Thomas.The publication's catalogue featured a photograph of the three artists in a faux- ethnographic style, dressed in traditional manner and mimicking the conventions of photographs taken in Samoa in the 1890s for Western consumption, as a comment on stereotypical presentations of Pacific peoples. =Vahine Collective= Hastings-McFall has also worked collaboratively with artists Lily Laita and Lonnie Hutchinson as the 'Vahine Collective'. In 2002 the collective researched ancient rock platforms called tia seu lupe (pigeon snaring mounds) in Samoa, resulting in an exhibition titled Vahine. In 2012 the collective shared the Creative New Zealand and National University of Samoa Samoa Artist in Residence award, with each artist spending a month in Samoa to extend the research and work began a decade earlier.

Geography The area ranges in altitude from above mean sea level. It has a number of rocky hills, with moist grassy uplands and forested valleys. The region lies within the Barberton centre of endemism. The mean annual precipitation is , with wet summers and dry winters. Geology The mountains lie on the eastern edge of the Kaapvaal Craton. The range is best known for having some of the oldest exposed rocks on Earth, estimated to be between 3.2 and 3.6 billion years (Ga) old, dating from the Paleoarchean. The mountain range's extreme age and exceptional preservation have yielded some of the oldest undisputed signs of life on Earth and provide insight into the hostile nature of the Precambrian environment under which this life evolved. This has led to the area being otherwise known as the \\"Genesis of life\\". The range is also known for its gold deposits and a number of komatiites, an unusual type of ultramafic volcanic rock named after the Komati River that flows through the belt. In April 2014, scientists reported finding evidence of the largest terrestrial meteor impact event to date near the area. They estimated the impact occurred about 3.26 billion years ago and that the impactor was approximately between 37 and 58 kilometers (23 to 36 miles) wide. The crater from this event, if it still exists, has not yet been found. In May 2019, extraterrestrial organic materials in 3.3-billion-year-old volcanic rocks was found at Makhonjwa Mountains. History Swazis and other pastoral peoples probably grazed their livestock there, but not in large numbers, until the arrival of European settlers in the 1860s. Gold was discovered near Kaapsehoop in 1875, but it was the find by George Barber and his cousins Fred and Harry Barber that triggered a gold rush in 1884, leading to the founding of the town of Barberton. It was later overshadowed by the 1886 Witwatersrand Gold Rush. Economically speaking, mining is declining, and the main activities are now timber harvesting and grazing. Commercial plantations grow pine and eucalyptus. In 2009, a submission was made for the region's classification as a World Heritage Site. The location became a World Heritage Site in 2018.

Early life Boucher was born in Paris. He had an interest in music at an early age; he was a pupil of Navoigille l'A√Æn√©, and aged eight he played at les Concert Spirituels. In 1787 he went to Madrid, where he was solo violinist to King Charles IV of Spain. During his time in Madrid he met Luigi Boccherini with whom he played chamber music. He married C√©leste Gallyot, a harpist and pianist to the king. After his return to Paris he became successful.Boucher, Alexandre-Jean Dictionnaire de la conversation et de la lecture, Volume 7 (Belin-Mandar 1833), page 440. In 1808 Charles IV of Spain was forced to abdicate, and he was kept prisoner at Fontainbleu by Napoleon; Boucher visited him there, and directed a small group of musicians that played for the former king.Boucher and the Marseillaise. Peter Sheppard Sk√¶rved. Retrieved 26 January 2018. Performances in Europe From about 1820 he travelled through Europe. His talent as a violinist was acknowledged, but he was regarded as a musical charlatan. The violinist and composer Louis Spohr met him in Brussels in 1819; he wrote: \\"His face bore a remarkable likeness to Napoleon Bonaparte's, and he had evidently carefully studied the banished emperor's way of bearing himself, lifting his hat, taking 'snuff,' etc..... He played a Haydn quartet, but he added so many ornaments of bad taste, that it was impossible to derive any pleasure from it.\\" Boucher encouraged the idea that he was exiled from France because his likeness to Napoleon might arouse sympathies for the former emperor. In 1821 the composer Carl Maria von Weber conducted a concert in Berlin, in which Boucher was a performer, playing Weber's Variations on a Norwegian Air, to which he added his own cadenza: > At a wave from Boucher, Weber stopped; and he and the astounded public > suddenly heard tremolandos, pizzicatos and other coarser tricks... then a > whole firework display....

He is noted as the author of widely copied, and later printed, books intended to aid parish priests and other clergy in their work. The most famous of these, his Book of Festivals or Festial was probably the most frequently printed English book before the Reformation. Life =Biographical information= Pews at St Peter's Collegiate Church in Wolverhampton. These were originally Lilleshall Abbey choir stalls, where the canons sat during worship, and were donated to the church after the Dissolution of the monasteries. Nothing is known of Mirk's life apart from what can be gathered from his works.Powell (2004) Mirk was a canon of Lilleshall Abbey and later prior of the abbey. Until recently he was generally considered to have written mainly around 1400,Bateson but is now thought to have been active from rather earlier ‚Äì probably the 1380s. His use of language and his name suggest he may have originated in northern England, a region strongly influenced by Norse settlement and culture. He seems to have been deeply committed to pastoral work and his work was directly relevant to the situation of Shrewsbury and its environs in his period.Coulton, p.5 This has similarities to the work of lay catechesis pioneered under John of Thoresby, the Archbishop of York a generation earlier. =Historical context= The Dance of Death, carrying off cleric and layperson alike in a 15th-century depiction. The church of Shrewsbury Abbey, although now a much truncated parish church, remains a dominant feature of the western approach to the town. Richard II ‚Äì a Victorian depiction. While biographical information is scant, the religious and political background to Mirk's work is fairly well-known. The defining event in Mirk's background was the Black Death,Ford, p.2. which killed half the population and had major and protracted consequences for society and economy, as well as the spiritual life of the survivors. However, Shropshire's agrarian crisis started much earlier in the century, with a major cattle murrain and crop failures between 1315 and 1322Baugh and Elrington, section 1 Moreover, the prolonged recovery from the disasters was jeopardised by the disorder of the early years of Henry IV's reign, when Owain Glynd≈µr's revolt and the uprisings of discontented English nobles devastated many areas. Lilleshall Abbey, Mirk's home, was a 12th-century foundation, originally intended to follow the rigorist teachings and practices of the Abbey of Arrouaise in northern France. Richard de Belmeis, one of the founders, was dean of the collegiate church of St Alkmund in Shrewsbury and was able to have the college suppressed and its wealth turned over to the abbey. This meant that Lilleshall was closely involved in the town of Shrewsbury, as much of its property was close to, and some within, the town. Lilleshall was brought to a nadir in the early 14th century by the agrarian crisis and the mismanagement and criminality of some abbots, notably John of Chetwynd, but made a surprisingly good recovery, largely through a reorganisation imposed by William de Shareshull. By Mirk's time, the abbey had entered a period of stability, reflected in a relatively high standard of monastic life and liturgy. However the most powerful monastery locally was Shrewsbury Abbey, a Benedictine house which greatly prized the relics of Saint Winifred. In the late 14th century a new shrine was built to contain them. A group of monks and abbey servants then stole the relics of St Beuno, Winifred's uncle and confessor, from Rhewl and installed them in the abbey church. The beginning of the Gospel of John from a copy of John Wycliffe's translation. A vernacular presentation of the gospel was a key feature of Lollardy. Shropshire was dominated by the FitzAlan Earls of Arundel,Baugh and Elrington, section 2 who had a strong influence on all aspects of political life, including parliamentary representation, in ShropshireL. S. Woodger. Shropshire in Roskell, Clark, and Rawcliffe. and in ShrewsburyL. S. Woodger. Shrewsbury in Roskell, Clark, and Rawcliffe. Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel was one of the Lords Appellant, opposed to Richard II's policies and his reliance on favourites The Appellants dominated the kingdom from 1387 to 1397 and Richard's brother, Thomas Arundel, became Archbishop of Canterbury. However, in 1397 the king moved against the Arundels and their allies. Earl Richard was arrested on 12 July, attainted, and executed on 21 September, while Thomas went into exile. Shortly afterwards, King Richard and his uncle, John of Gaunt, both stayed at Lilleshall Abbey, in connection with a session of Parliament held from 27‚Äì31 January in Shrewsbury, which brought looting by members of the royal household. It is not surprising that the Archbishop and Thomas FitzAlan, 12th Earl of Arundel, his nephew, were closely involved from the outset in the new Lancastrian regime of Henry IV, who seized power in 1399. The Battle of Shrewsbury, decisively securing Henry's grip on power, was fought just to the north of the town in 1403, causing considerable damage to the surrounding area. After this, Arundel tightened his grip on Shropshire, operating through an affinity of local landowners pledged to his service. These retainers were confirmed in his circle and in mutual solidarity by participating in his religious benefactions. In 1407, for example, a group of Arundel's retainers, including Robert Corbet, his brother Roger together donated a house in Shrewsbury to the Abbey.L. S. Woodger. CORBET, Robert (1383‚Äì1420), of Moreton Corbet, Salop. in Roskell, Clark, and Rawcliffe. This outward piety did not stop them taking part in an armed raid directed against Wenlock Priory a few years later. It was also in 1407 that William Thorpe is thought to have preached a Lollard sermon from the pulpit of St Chad's Church, ShrewsburyCoulton, p.9 He proclaimed the centrality of the Word of God in preaching and Scripture against reliance on the sacraments and denounced the veneration of images and relics. He was particularly critical of pilgrimage, which he considered both futile in itself and surrounded by numerous social ills.Coulton, p.10 This all clashed with popular religion as practised locally, with its lucrative cult of St Winifred and its highly organised celebration of Corpus Christi, featuring procession of the town's many trades.Coulton, p.8 Thorpe was arrested, together with his associate, John Pollyrbach, and interviewed by Thomas Prestbury, the abbot of Shrewsbury, before being despatched to Archbishop Arundel. Thorpe's Testimony, purporting to recount these interviews, portrays the ensuing interchange as a victory for himself against Arundel, who was an enthusiastic persecutor of Lollards.Coulton, p.12 Whatever the truth of this, Arundel sent commissions to Shropshire in May 1407 to arrest suspected Lollards,Coulton, p.13 suggesting that the movement was perceived as a threat locally. Mirk's works are definitely orthodox and the Festial rejects Lollard teaching both implicitly and explicitly. It is possible that it was deliberately disseminated to combat Lollardy in the Midlands. Works Page from a Gough manuscript of John Mirk's Festial, which formed the basis of Erbe's 1905 edition. Corpus Christi procession, early 16th century. The feast was an important focus for popular piety, commercial display and civic pride in the late Middle Ages. =Festial= The Liber Festivalis (Book of Festivals) or Festial is a collection of homilies for the festivals of the liturgical year as it was celebrated in Mirk's time in Shropshire. He began with Advent Sunday and worked his way through to All Saints' Day, with a final sermon for the consecration of a church, although the order is disturbed to some extent in some manuscripts. Each sermon features one or more narrations, intended to illustrate the theme. His most important source was the Golden Legend, an immensely popular collection of hagiographies compiled by Jacobus de Voragine in the mid-13th century. However, Mirk chose to write in the vernacular, Middle English, a decision of ambiguous significance. It distinguished him from most other apologists for orthodoxy, as use of the vernacular was a key demand of the Lollards, although it was still not considered heretical in itself.Ford, p.113 Mirk was faced by the rise of a new class of literate laypeople,Ford, p.25 as well as by the sometimes unlettered parish clergy whom he acknowledges as his audience. His response was to present a compressed but comprehensive view of Christian teaching that privileges oral tradition above Biblical texts. Mirk's narrations have often seemed simplistic or \\"materialist\\" to later ages. Ford comments that \\"English sermon collections composed with a popular audience in mind almost invariably favor a story- telling style and have been almost invariably criticized by scholars.\\"Ford, p.18 The homily for Corpus Christi defends the doctrine of Transubstantiation, which the festival celebrates and the Lollards rejected, with just such a story, concerning Oda of Canterbury. Mirk goes on explicitly to reject Lollard teaching on images. Here Mirk is relatively sophisticated, arguing that the very traditional and popular religion that the Lollards rejected, properly interpreted, is not a distraction but actually a spur to a proper appreciation of Christian soteriology. Depiction of a carved stone, considered by Owen and Blakeway to have come from Shrewsbury Abbey and to depict St Winifred, flanked by John the Baptist and St Beuno.Owen and Blakeway, p.74 Part of the prologue of a life of St Winifred, allegedly written by Robert, a prior of Shrewsbury Abbey, in the mid-12th century. Bodleian Mss. Laud c.94 Mirk's responsiveness to local concerns is particularly evident in his homily for the feast of Saint Winifred. It retells the death and resurrection of the Welsh saint and of the translation of her thaumaturgic relics to Shrewsbury.Festial (ed. Erbe), p.177-82 The same emphasis on the miraculous and on the local continues in the homily for the feast of St Alkmund,Festial (ed. Erbe), p.240-44 hardly known outside the English Midlands, but especially important to Lilleshall Abbey, the successor institution to the college of St Alkmund in Shrewsbury. The opening remarks of the homily make clear that it was specifically written for St Alkmund's, now a parish church in Shrewsbury: In Mirk's telling of his legend, Alkmund was a King of Northumbria who had a wide hegemony. He intervened in a dispute between two vassal states. One side, the \\"duke of the March and Wales,\\" refused to come to an agreement, and knowing that the other side were guiltless and had little chance of resisting, Alkmund voluntarily joined them in battle and met his inevitable death. However, Mirk then twists the story to argue a much more general point. As with his Corpus Christi homily, Mirk seeks to outflank Lollard criticisms. Where they rejected the cult of saints as a distraction from the central salvific role of Christ, Mirk portrays the saint's sacrificial and altruistic death as imaging Christ's passion. Lollard concerns are not simply dismissed but countered by a reinterpretation of tradition. Over forty known manuscripts of the Festial are extant but about half diverge greatly from Mirk's original, with much of the local colour removed. It seems that there was a scholarly revision around the mid 15th century, intended to appeal to a more educated audience,Ford, p.9 and this was the basis of the printed editions. By the time William Caxton printed the Festial in 1483 it was well-established. It was printed in a further 22 editions, both in England and abroad, including a 1493 edition by Wynkyn de Worde, Caxton's associate and successor, who also printed the final edition in 1532. It was still widely read throughout the 16th century but then faded from view. Interest began to revive after the 1905, when the first volume of Theodore Erbe's edition, based primarily on a Gough manuscript in the Bodleian Library,Festial (ed. Erbe), p.x was published for the Early English Text Society. However, this contained only a text and glossary. Erbe's second volume, intended to contain most of the scholarly apparatus,Festial (ed. Erbe), p.v never appeared and he was killed in World War I. As a result, Ford could write in 2006 that it was \\"widely known and little studied in the modern academic community, in spite of its medieval popularity.\\"Ford, p.16 However, Susan Powell, now Emeritus Professor of Medieval Texts and Culture at Salford University, had long campaigned for the recognition of the historical importance of Mirk's work, and in 2009 brought out the first volume of a new edition, also for the Early English Text Society. This is based on a Cotton manuscript in the British Library. The second volume was released in 2011. Erbe's edition remains in print and, being long out of copyright, is available free of charge online. =Instructions for Parish Priests= The Works of Mercy, by the Master of Alkmaar, early 16th century. The works of mercy are shown in this order: feeding the hungry, giving drink to the thirsty, clothing the naked, burying the dead, sheltering the traveller, comforting the sick, and freeing the prisoner. Instructions for Parish Priests is in lively vernacular verse, using octosyllabic lines and rhyming couplets throughout,Coulton, p.6 and running to 1934 lines. The colophon runs: :Explicit tractatus qui dicitur pars oculi, de latino in anglicum translatus per fratrem Johannem myrcus, canonicum regularem Monasterii de Lylleshul, cuius anime propicietur deus! Amen.Instructions (ed. Peacock/Furnivall), p.vi Mirk maintains here that he had interpreted the work from a Latin manual called Pars oculi:Instructions (ed. Peacock/Furnivall), p.vi a title familiar from manuals for the clergy like the Oculus Sacerdotis of William of Pagula, which was widely available in Mirk's time in the form republished by John de Burgh as Pupilla oculi. However, this work is much larger than Mirk's. Another possible influence was the sacerdotal manual by Mirk himself but even this too is far too long to have been the original,Instructions (ed. Peacock/Furnivall), p.vii and seems moreover to be of later date. The underlying text behind his translation is not known, if it ever existed: it seems more likely that Mirk drew inspiration from the earlier manuals but did not directly translate. Notably, he is here described as a canon of Lilleshall, signifying that this work dates from the period before he became prior of the abbey. The medieval Catholic Church had expended considerable energy in systematising the basic teachings of its faith. In 1215, the first canon of the Fourth Council of the Lateran had defined conclusively the main points of Catholic dogma that needed to be communicated to all.Powell (2009), p.114 Archbishop John Peckham turned this into a clear list for his Archdiocese of Canterbury in the Lambeth Constitutions of 1281,Lay Folks' Catechism, ed. Simmons and Nolloth, p.x-xi which promulgated a manual known as the Ignorantia sacerdotum. John of Thoresby went further, largely reiterating Peckham's pronouncementsLay Folks' Catechism, ed. Simmons and Nolloth, p.xiv- xv but also having them adapted and expanded into a vernacular verse document, known as the Lay Folks' CatechismLay Folks' Catechism, ed. Simmons and Nolloth, p.xvii for his Archdiocese of York, in 1357. Both these catechetical manuals set out six key areas to cover: The Creed (condensed to a 14-point summary), the Ten Commandments, The Seven Sacraments, the Seven Deeds of Mercy, the Seven Virtues, the Seven Deadly Sins. Mid-15th century Seven Sacraments Altarpiece by Rogier van der Weyden Mirk's work falls well within this catechetical tradition. He was aware that many priests could draw on little learning in giving counsel to their flock. Initially, Mirk's themes are loosely connected but unsystematic. He gives the priests general instructions on leading a chaste and austere life.Instructions (ed. Peacock/Furnivall), p.2-3 He then moves suddenly from stressing a priest's preaching duties to a series of injunctions on baptism, childbirth, and the role of midwives, stressing the imperative need to deliver a child surgically from a dead mother so it can be baptised in case of emergency ‚Äì even if necessary to call on a man's help.Instructions (ed. Peacock/Furnivall), p.4 Consideration is then given to the role of godparents at baptism and confirmation, consanguinity and betrothal, lechery, avoidance of incest, pederasty and adultery. Then follows a diversion into the Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist and its consequences for Eucharistic practice.Instructions (ed. Peacock/Furnivall), p.8 Various injunctions are then delivered, e.g. games must not be played in churchyards; tithes are to paid scrupulously; witchcraft is evil; but usury is especially galling to Jesus, and exploitative pricing is usury by another name. The Seven deadly Sins and Four Last Things (1485) by Hieronymus Bosch Once this excursus is finished, however, Mirk essentially follows the six points of the Lay Folks' Catechism. He gives the text of the Lord's Prayer and the short form of the Hail Mary then in use, both in English.Instructions (ed. Peacock/Furnivall), p.13-4 Then comes consideration of the Apostles' Creed, which is then versified and divided into fourteen articles;Instructions (ed. Peacock/Furnivall), p.14-6 a summary of the seven sacraments, followed by detailed consideration of baptism,Instructions (ed. Peacock/Furnivall), p.17-21 confirmation and confession.Instructions (ed. Peacock/Furnivall), p.21-26 This provided a narrative thread as the theme of confession leads naturally into questioning a penitent. The framework for this interrogation is provided by Ten Commandments,Instructions (ed. Peacock/Furnivall), p.27-30 the Seven Deadly Sins,Instructions (ed. Peacock/Furnivall), p.30-40 the Seven Deeds of Mercy,Instructions (ed. Peacock/Furnivall), p.42 and the Seven Virtues, each considered in relation to the corresponding sin.Instructions (ed. Peacock/Furnivall), p.48-50 Penance is then explained,Instructions (ed. Peacock/Furnivall), p.50-53 followed by the Last rites, of which it forms a part.Instructions (ed. Peacock/Furnivall), p.53-4 After a series of instructions for those that are \\"mene of lore,\\" the least learned priests,Instructions (ed. Peacock/Furnivall), p.54-9 Mirk's conclusion asks that the reader pray for the author.Instructions (ed. Peacock/Furnivall), p.59 Only seven manuscripts of the Instructions survive, although the fact that it was a manual intended for regular use suggests that many may have been lost through wear and tear. An edition, prepared for the Early English Text Society by Edward Peacock, was published in 1868 and revised in 1902 by Frederick James Furnivall. As these are out of copyright, both versions are now freely available online. A modern critical edition was produced in Sweden in 1974 by Gillis Kristensson of Lund University. =Manuale Sacerdotis= Manuscript of The Imitation of Christ by Thomas √† Kempis, a German Augustinian, and dating from about 1418. Imitation of Christ and an intense focus of the Eucharist were common threads in Augustinian theology and spirituality of the period. The Manuale Sacerdotis or Priest's Handbook seems to date from about 1400 ‚Äì rather later than Mirk's other works, and when he was prior of Lilleshall.Powell (2009), p.112 Like the Instructions, it seems to draw on William of Pagula's work, but it has an entirely different agenda from Mirk's earlier work. Instead of providing simple instruction in doctrine and practice, it aims to provide an understanding of the meaning and role of the priesthood. This accounts for Mirk's decision to write in Latin prose, as the audience is assumed to be better-educated. It is addressed to a friend of Mirk, named as \\"John, vicar of A.\\" It has been conjectured that he was John Sotton, who was vicar of St Alkmund's from 1414, and he is called \\"John de S\\" in some manuscripts.Powell (2009), p.114-5 This is not simply a preliminary dedication: John is continually addressed throughout the book.Powell (2009), p.122 Mirk begins by contrasting the good priest with the modern priest, who is distracted by the vanities of secular life.Powell (2009), p.115-6 He proceeds to a detailed account of the priest's activities, including the canonical hours and celebration of the Eucharist.Powell (2009), p.118-20 Here, as he considers the focus of the priestly office, he explicitly responds to Lollardy, explaining in detail the doctrine of Transubstantiation. He re-uses the story of St Oda that he employed in his homily for Corpus Christi.Powell (2009), p.121 Mirk's underlying purpose seems to be to make clear the correlation between the external activity to the inner life, which for Mirk, involves the following of a rule: ‚Äúlife without a rule is nothing less than dying.‚Äù While Mirk follows a written rule, he commends to the priest the principles inherent in Christ's own life. The Manuale has been overshadowed by the Festial and the Instructions, not least because it is in Latin and probably never had the wide readership of the vernacular works. Thirteen extant manuscripts are known. It has not yet been printed, although a critical edition by Susan Powell and James Girsch, based on Bodleian Library MS Bodley 632, is planned.

His 1976 book of London graffiti photography The Writing on The Wall was one of the first extensive surveys of the city's burgeoning 'scene'.  Life and work  Perry studied at Harrow School of Art after deciding to become a professional photographer. Around this time he became friends with Tony Elliott who was studying at Keele University, editing a student magazine that Perry contributed to. When Elliott went on to found Time Out, he employed Perry as house photographer. Working alongside designer Pearce Marchbank, Perry created hundreds of iconic covers for the London listings magazine. One cover that Perry photographed, working with Marchbank, came third in the Professional Publishers Association Cover of the Century award. It depicted Winston Churchill's trademark V sign, with Marchbank's studio cleaner acting as 'hand-double' for the shoot. The 1980s saw Perry moving into photojournalism, particularly for the colour supplements of the Sunday newspapers such as The Sunday Times, where he regularly worked on the \\"Life in the Day\\" feature. Due to severe rheumatoid arthritis, Perry retired to Suffolk where he began trading and restoring classic Lancia cars. He was known to use his Lancia Stratos as an everyday runaround car. He died in Cambridge in 1991, with large obituaries published in many of the publications he used to contribute to, with Ian Jack writing an extensive one for The Independent. In 2014 Perry's graffiti book The Writing on The Wall was republished after a Kickstarter campaign was started by George Stewart-Lockhart. The new edition is expanded to include more photographs, with an extensive new foreword, as well as a short essay by Bill Drummond. The original introduction by George Melly was also included, as well as numerous recollections about Perry from friends and colleagues such as Tony Elliott, Neil Lyndon and Simon Park, amongst others.

In parallel, she was a member of the private circle of the Empress, who reportedly refused to let the affair affect their relationship. When she began the affair with the Emperor, Marie-Anne Walewska openly stated to the Empress that it would no longer be seen proper for her to be invited to the private functions of the Empress because rumours had put it about that she was the mistress of the Emperor, and that she refused to allow it to affect their friendship.Seward, Desmond: Eug√©nie.

An empress and her empire. (2004) The relationship with the Emperor was not exclusive.

(2004) In November 1861, the relationship was noted to be discontinued. Her husband was reportedly displeased about it, because he had come to rely upon it as a valuable channel of influence to the Emperor which could be of use to him.Seward, Desmond: Eug√©nie.

Agreement forests first arose when studying combinatorial problems related to computational phylogenetics, in particular tree rearrangements.  Preliminaries  Recall that a tree (or a forest) is irreductible when it lacks any internal node of degree 2. In the case of a rooted tree (or a rooted forest), the root(s) are of course allowed to have degree 2, since they are not internal nodes. Any tree (or forest) can be made irreductible by applying a sequence of edge contractions. An irreductible (rooted or unrooted) tree whose leaves are bijectively labeled by elements of a set is called a (rooted or unrooted) -tree. Such a -tree usually model a phylogenetic tree, where the elements of (the taxon set) could represent species, individual organisms, DNA sequences, or other biological objects. Two -trees and are said to be isomorphic when there exists a graph isomorphism between them which preserves the leaf labels. In the case of rooted -trees, the isomorphism must also preserves the root. Given a -tree and a taxon subset , the minimal subtree of that connects all leaves in is denoted by . When is rooted, then is also rooted, with its root being the node closest to the original root of . This subtree needs not be a -tree, because it might not be irreductible. We therefore further define the restricted subtree , which is obtained from by suppressing all internal nodes of degree 2, yielding a proper -tree.  Agreement forests  An agreement forest for two unrooted -trees and is a partition } of the taxon set satisfying the following conditions: # and are isomorphic for every and # the subtrees in and are vertex-disjoint subtrees of and , respectively. The set partition } is identified with the forest of restricted subtrees }, with either or (the choice of it begin irrelevant because of condition 1). Therefore, an agreement forest can either be seen as a partition of the taxon set or as a forest (in the classical graph-theoretic sense) of restricted subtrees. The size of an agreement forest is simply its number of components. Intuitively, an agreement forest of size for two phylogenetic trees is a forest which can be obtained from both trees by removing edges in each tree and subsequently suppressing internal nodes of degree . = Rooted case = = Acyclic agreement forests = A raffinement on the above definition can be made, resulting in the concept of acyclic agreement forest. An agreement forest for two -trees and is said to be acyclic if each of its tree components can be numbered in such a way that if the root of one component is an ancestor of the root of another component in either or , then the number assigned to is lower than the number assigned to . Another characterization of acyclicity in agreement forest is to consider the directed graph that has vertex set and a directed edge if and only if and at least one of the two following conditions hold: # the root of is an ancestor of the root of in # the root of is an ancestor of the root of in The directed graph is called the inheritance graph associated with the agreement forest , and we call acyclic if has no directed cycle.  Optimization problems  A (rooted, unrooted, acyclic) agreement forest for and is said to be maximum if it contains the smallest possible number of elements (i.e. it has the smallest size). In this context, it is the agreement between the two trees which is maximized: it explains why computing a maximum agreement forest actually means minimizing its number of components. This leads to two different (but related) optimization problems. In both cases, we choose to minimize rather than , because the former corresponds to the number of cuts to be done in each tree in order to obtain . * maximal ‚â† maximum * unrooted MAF corresponds to TBR * rooted MAF corresponds to rSPR * acyclic MAF corresponds to HYB * AFs can be defined on non-binary trees * AFs can be defined on more than two trees * acyclic agreement forests have a role to play in the computation of HYB on 3 or more trees, but the relationship is much weaker than in the case of 2 trees * Complexity * FPT algorithms * Approximation algorithms * Exponential time algorithms  Notes  Category:Trees (graph theory) ","title":"Agreement forest"},{"id":"44659943","text":"John Mask Peace House, also known as Bambro Plantation, is a historic plantation house located near Fairport, Granville County, North Carolina.

It is preceded by Peter's Room and succeeded by The Ready-Made Family. Plot introduction The Thuggery Affair is unusual in terms of the wider Marlow saga, in being a boy-dominated story. The main characters are Peter and Lawrie Marlow and their friend and neighbour Patrick Merrick. Nicola, the usual heroine of the series, is visiting her friend Miranda in London and Ginty is visiting her French grandmother. The action is set mainly in Colebridge, the nearest town to the Marlow family's home at Trennels, during spring half-term. Plot summary Miss Maudie Culver, a local landowner, employs a gang of juvenile delinquents to help her look after her pigeons. Patrick Merrick incurs her wrath when his falcon kills two of the birds. Peter notices that one of the pigeons is carrying a drug capsule. Patrick sneaks into Miss Culver's dovecote (a huge stone edifice) but is apprehended by the thugs. A scuffle breaks out, a gang member is stabbed to death and the thugs flee. Jukie, the gang leader, requisitions Miss Culver's car and attempts to escape, taking Patrick with him. They discuss Catholicism, Jukie's childhood and the H-bomb. The car swerves as Patrick attempts to stop them hitting a police roadblock. Jukie is killed when the car hits a tree but Patrick is thrown clear. Reception The Thuggery Affair was relatively unsuccessful compared to other books in the series, being printed in only one hardback and one paperback edition during Forest's lifetime; it was finally reprinted by Girls Gone By in 2005.

He is generally counted as the eleventh in the list of 63 Nayanars. Life Kungiliya Kalaya Nayanar is regarded as a historical figure, evident from accounts where he played host to the Nayanar saints Appar (Tirunavukkarasar, 7th century), Sambandar (7th century), Siruthondar (Paranjothi, the army general of the Pallava king Narasimhavarman I, who ruled between 630‚Äì668 CE) and Nilanakkar (Tiruneelanakka). The life of Kungiliya Kalaya Nayanar is described in the Periya Puranam by Sekkizhar (12th century), which is a hagiography of the 63 Nayanars. Kalaya was born in Tirukadavur (Katavur), presently known as Thirukkadaiyur, Nagapattinam district of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It was then part of the Chola kingdom. Thirukkadaiyur is famous for Amritaghateswarar Abhirami Temple dedicated to the god Shiva, the patron god of Shaivism and of Kalaya. Kalaya was a Brahmin, member of the priest caste and worked as a temple priest. Kalaya served Shiva by offering Him incense called Kungiliya, giving him the name Kungiliya Kalaya. Shiva is said to be pleased with Kungiliya Kalaya's service, but decided to test his devotion. Over course of time, Kungiliya Kalaya's wealth diminished. He lost his money and possessions. He had to sell his properties to feed his starving family. However, he continued to burn incense sticks in Shiva's temple. When all valuables were sold, only his wife's gold thali (a necklace given by a groom to a bride in a Hindu wedding, which she wears as a sign of her marital status) remained. The wife removed her thali and gave it for Kalaya to sell and bring some rice for the family, even though it was considered inauspicious for a married woman to remove it. However, Shiva disguised as a Kungiliya merchant or hawker and asked if he wanted to buy the incense. Unmindful of his family's condition, Kungiliya Kalaya traded the thali for a bag of incense and went to the temple to burn it. The wife waited patiently and finally put the children to bed and prayed to Shiva. Shiva was pleased with the devotion of the couple and appeared in the dream of the wife and promised to restore their wealth. When she woke the next day, the house was filled with valuable objects. She sang a panegyric in honour of the Lord and prepared the meal and waited for Kalaya. Shiva then appears before Kungiliya Kalaya - who had lost his senses and was immersed in devotion till then - in the temple and blesses him. He instructs him to return to his home and wife. Kungiliya Kalaya returned home to find his house transformed into a mansion with all wealth. Several devotees of Shiva gathered there. Kungiliya Kalaya served the devotees and distributed money amongst them. Another tale associates Kungiliya Kalaya Nayanar with the Aruna Jadeswarar Temple, a Shiva temple in Thiruppanandal. The Nayanar wanted to visit the Thiruppanandal temple. The lingam (Shiva's aniconic symbol, generally worshipped as his form in the sanctum sanatorium of the temple) of this temple was bent. It was said that a female devotee called Thadaga was garlanding the lingam where her upper part of the sari slipped; she tried to garland the lingam with one hand while holding her sari by the other. Shiva bent his neck (shaft of the lingam), making it easier for her to garland the lingam. The lingam remained in the leaning posture since that day. Many tried to straighten the lingam, but failed. The Chola king, who was renovating the temple, was upset. The saint offered to help the king. He sang the Panchakshara mantra and offered Kungiliya incense to Shiva. He tied one end of the rope around his neck and other bend around the shaft of the stone lingam, at the risk being suffocated by the noose. He pulled gently and Shiva complied by making the lingam straight. The king became happy and rewarded Kungiliya Kalaya Nayanar with many gifts. The hagiography says that after serving Shaivas for many years, Kungiliya Kalaya Nayanar attained Kailash, Shiva's abode on his death. Remembrance The images of the Nayanars are found in many Shiva temples in Tamil Nadu. One of the most prominent Nayanars, Sundarar (8th century) mentions Kungiliya Kalaya Nayanar (called Kalayan of Katavur) in hymn to various Nayanar saints. When Sambandar met Kungiliya Kalaya Nayanar at Tirukadavur, he composed a hymn singing the glories of the latter. Kungiliya Kalaya Nayanar is depicted wearing a crown, with folded hands (see Anjali mudra) and holding a club in the crook of his arm.

CHCs are formed at the village level. The concept was developed and popularized by Africa AHEAD, a Zimbabwe NGO.  History  The idea of CHCs originated in Kenya, where Juliet Waterkeyn developed illustrations for training materials to be used for the Kenya Water for Health Organisation (KWAHO). She observed the living conditions and habits of rural Kenyan communities. She claimed that a lack of ownership was the cause for slow community development. The concept of CHC was developed to gather communities and communally discuss hygiene to improve the health of children.  Operation  Community Health Workers (CHW) and Environmental Health Technicians (EHT) often help run the clubs. They receive one week of training; they are given the training materials and taught how to use them. The two types of CHCs are Classic and Lite. The difference is the length of the training of the CHWs and the number of dialogue sessions that they are trained to offer. CHCs attract an average of 75 members, which includes an elected six member committee, a chairperson, a secretary and a Community Health Worker (CHW) facilitator. The facilitator is responsible for leading dialogue sessions and motivating club members to adopt better hygiene. Classic CHCs have a training session of 6 months where the club meets weekly to discuss one of the 20 - 24 dialogue sessions on health and hygiene. Lite CHCs have a training period of 3 months and discuss a total of 8 dialogue sessions concentrating only on WASH topics. After each session, members are given homework and are encouraged to complete it before the next session. Each member is given a membership card when they join the club, and the CHW is responsible for signing off the dialogue sessions attended by each member. A certificate of completion is awarded to club members that complete all dialogue sessions. Process The four main CHC stages: = Health Promotion = Members meet weekly for a two-hour session. During these sessions cards are used to engage members in discussions and debates on topics promoting health and hygiene. Various participatory activities take place that entertain and encourage members to get involved in the decision-making process on improving daily hygiene habits. Members are encouraged to make small changes in their own homes each week. These recommended practices rarely require financial expenditure and are solely habit changing. = Safe Drinking Water and Sanitation = Once club members begin to understand the transmission of germs. When a majority of the members become convinced, peer pressure makes sanitation a priority and club members help each other meet their new hygiene standards. Latrines and wells are dug, hand washing facilities are built without outside funds. The maintenance of water facilities is the responsibility of the CHC committee. At the end of this stage, high-risk habits have been replaced by safe hygiene practices and basic safe water and sanitation facilities are available. = Food Agriculture and Nutrition (FAN) = Members focus on child survival and a balanced diet. Communal nutrition gardens are started by CHC members where produce is organised to maintain a balanced year-round diet. These gardens help to support vulnerable families. = Empowerment of Women = CHC meetings can result in the construction of a permanent meeting shelter, which can be used for day care for toddlers. Other clubs start income generating projects such as soap making, whilst others create saving and loan schemes to enable members to buy products needed to maintain hygiene standards. As most CHCs have more female members, the clubs end up becoming a safety net for mothers.

Biography  Crevasses on the Glacier du Geant, Mont Blanc Massif, John Mitchell Fine Paintings, London His father was a captain in the French Engineers and Lopp√©'s childhood was spent in many different towns in south-eastern France. At the age of twenty-one, Lopp√© climbed a small mountain in the Languedoc and found a group of painters sketching on the summit. He had found his calling and subsequently went off to Geneva where he met the reputed leading Swiss landscapist, Alexandre Calame (1810 -1864)Mitchell, William J, Gabriel Lopp√© Peintre-Alpiniste (2018), John Mitchell Fine Paintings, . Lopp√© took up mountaineering in Grindelwald in the 1850s and made friends easily with the many English climbers in France and Switzerland. Although he was frequently labelled as a pupil of Calame and his rival Francois Diday, Lopp√© was almost an entirely self-taught artist. He became the first painter to work at higher altitudes during climbing expeditions, earning the right to be considered the founder of the peintres- alpinistes school, which became established in the Savoie at the turn of the nineteenth century. Together with the first ascent of Mont Mallet in Chamonix‚Äôs Grandes Jorasses range, Lopp√© made over forty ascents of Mont Blanc during his climbing career, which lasted until the late 1890s. Lopp√© frequently made oil sketches from alpine summits, including a panorama of the view from the summit of Mont Blanc. His paintings became celebrated for their atmosphere and spontaneity, and he soon found himself taking part in many exhibitions in London and in Paris. By 1896 Lopp√© had spent over fifty seasons climbing and painting in ChamonixCatalogue raisonn√© of Gabriel Lopp√© - Gallery antiquity of Bourget-du-lac in France. As the valley‚Äôs unrivalled ‚ÄòCourt painter‚Äô his work was in constant demand, with the majority of his pictures going to English climbers and summer tourists. In his later years, Lopp√© became fascinated with photography and was quite an innovator in this field too. His long exposure photograph of the Eiffel Tower struck by lightning, now in the Mus√©e d'Orsay in Paris remains one of his iconic images.  Notes   References  * Schurr, G√©rald (1975).

Biography Bradley was born in Derry, Ireland where he attended a parochial school, later immigrating to the United States in 1850. He settled in Brooklyn, and became a tobacconist, and later a dealer in stoves and tinware. During the American Civil War, he was a captain in the 14th Regiment of the New York National Guard. After the war he also engaged in the real estate and insurance business. Bradley was elected to the New York State Assembly on a combined Democratic and Independent ticket in 1874. Bradley was a ‚ÄòSoft Shell,‚Äô against slavery and in the more liberal wing of the Democratic Party. His election opened a rift in the King‚Äôs County Democratic Party in Brooklyn, and He was placed on one of two rival Democratic committees, with ‚ÄòHard Shell‚Äô John J. Vanderbilt on the other. At the time, the Brooklyn Eagle commented that ‚ÄúThe contrast between the two men could hardly have been more manifest.‚Äù Bradley was twice re-elected, and became known as a fighter against graft and corruption. He earned the nickname ‚ÄúHonest Dan‚Äù for his personal incorruptibility. In 1893, he was elected to the New York State Senate as a ‚ÄúReform‚Äù Democrat, in another contentious election. His opponent, William Van Slooten, was a member of New York‚Äôs powerful Hugh McLaughlin machine, but was otherwise relatively unknown. Bradley used ‚ÄúWho is Van Slooten?‚Äù as his campaign slogan. He was sworn into the Senate in 1894 as that body‚Äôs youngest man, although he was then about sixty. One of Bradley‚Äôs first bills in the Senate was a proposal to establish fixed salaries for Senators. Prior to this, State Senators had taken graft from contractors and other special interest groups. Bradley‚Äôs bill was designed to stop this. In 1894, Daniel Bradley was active in the investigations of the Lexow Committee, which heard some 57,666 pages of testimony and served over 3,000 subpoenas. Bradley was a devout Catholic as a member of Church of the Assumption in Brooklyn. He was active in the Catholic Benevolent Legion, helping to establish new branches, and was a member of the Board of Managers of the Catholic Orphan Society. He and his wife, Julia Duane, had three daughters and two sons. Catherine married Thomas E. Murray, an Albany inventor and businessman. They raised eight children in Brooklyn. He died at the home of his son-in-law Thomas E. Murray Jr., at 783 St. Mark's Avenue in Brooklyn, after \\"suffering with grip for four weeks\\".

He played mainly at inside right, but also at inside left and right half. Football career Connaboy began his football career with junior club Arniston Rangers. After a successful trial with Arbroath in December 1934, in which he played at inside right in the Division Two match against Raith Rovers, he moved into senior football. He played infrequently, and failed to impress the commentators, who suggested his ability was not reflected in his performance. He assisted Arbroath to a second-place finish in his first season, and was retained for the 1935‚Äì36 Division One campaign. He was used less in the forward line than at right half: he was reported to have \\"put up a good show\\" in that position against Celtic, albeit in a 5‚Äì0 defeat, and \\"The Rover\\", writing in the Arbroath Herald after Connaboy had left the club, reported that \\"it looked to many towards last back-end as if he was going to blossom forth as a nifty right- half\\". His appearances continued sporadically: his first outing of the 1936‚Äì37 season was not until December, and in January, \\"The Rover\\" suggested that in light of only 24 matches spread over two years with the club, \\"it is scarcely to be expected that he can be a positive star whenever he is drafted into active service\\", but that his recent run of games had made a clear improvement. The club's decision to omit his name from their retained list at the end of the season was not entirely popular. After a trial with English club Wolverhampton Wanderers in August came to nothing, Connaboy played a few games for Leith Athletic in Division Two. It was reported that he had not actually signed for the club, but was considering offers from Airdrieonians and English club Hull City as well as from Leith. In October, he moved to England to join Third Division club Darlington. He played just once, against Halifax Town on 6 November, and was back in Scotland by December. After a spell in Division Two Alloa Athletic, during which he scored against Raith Rovers in a 6‚Äì3 loss, he moved into the Lancashire Combination with Bangor City ahead of the 1938‚Äì39 season.

Taxonomy Halystina umberlee belongs in the genus Halystina, a group of small-sized sea snails with a rounded shell profile, flat-sided whorls and finely granulate protoconch. It is considered to resemble species in the genus Halystes, differing only by its much smaller size. It was named after Umberlee, a fictional goddess from the Faer√ªnian pantheon of the Forgotten Realms campaign setting for the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game. Description Halystina umberlee is a very small species, barely reaching a shell height of 2 mm. It has a rounded, conic to turbinate shell, with relatively thick walls and up to 5 whorls. Its bulbous protoconch consists of a single whorl with a pitted surface, and the protoconch-teleoconch transition is marked by a thin line. The teleoconch has 4 convex whorls, sculptured by delicate spiral cordlets crossed by axial threads, forming a delicate net-like pattern. The axial threads form an overall continuous sigmoid pattern along the shell's longitudinal axis, and the spiral sculpture becomes gradually weaker toward the basal region of last whorl. The basal part of the shell is sculptured by 10-12 spiral cords, but the umbilical region is smooth, with a well-marked margin. The aperture is quadrangular, and bears three deep sinuses. The shell is colored glossy white, with a nacreous shade. Distribution This marine species occurs off southeastern Brazil, from Esp√≠rito Santo to Rio de Janeiro, at 950‚Äì1550 m depths.

Cortez, however, returned to reclaim the seat in the general election held on November 8, 2016. Cortez polled 29,319 votes (51.3 percent) to Galindo's 27,783 (48.6 percent). Background Reared on the Southside of San Antonio, Galindo is a son of Oscar Hernandez Galindo, a former civilian employee of the since-closed Kelly Air Force Base, and his mom Sylvia Tejeda former employee is southwestern Bell and USAA, and his wife, Valerie Galindo. He graduated from a parochial school, Central Catholic High School in downtown San Antonio. He subsequently received a degree in Finance and Risk Management from St. Mary's University in San Antonio.

It is the first township seen on entering Soweto from the frequently used New Canada Road. Noordgesig is a Coloured township. It is colloquially called \\"Bulte\\"(meaning Hills) by its residence and neighbors, as depicted by the Mine Dumps surrounding the Township. The name \\"Bulte\\" was coined as a form of endearment by the residence for the longest time. History The township is one of the oldest \\"Coloured\\" townships and one of multiple locations that make up greater Soweto. However, this is difficult to discern from historical works, which, if they mention Noordgesig at all, only name it, and predominantly focus on the establishment of Orlando in the mid-1930s, and then later in the 1950s, the construction of Meadowlands and Diepkloof, or the uprising of June 16, 1976. The historical analysis of Soweto largely ignores Noordgesig. Noordgesig was not administered as part of greater Orlando until after the end of apartheid, and is therefore not distinguished from it, which consequently might offer a reason why histories of Soweto never include its establishment in their analysis.P. Bonner & L. Segal, Soweto: A History (Cape Town: Maskew Miller Longman, 1998); E. Hellmann, Soweto: Johannesburg‚Äôs African City (Johannesburg: South African Institute of Race Relations, 1971). Because it was established for coloured occupation, government documents relating to Noordgesig are filed in the various departments dealing with coloured affairs and not those of Orlando or Soweto. Accordingly, a study of this township fills in this absence in historical literature. Because it was established for coloured occupation, government documents relating to Noordgesig are filed in the various departments dealing with coloured affairs and not those of Orlando or Soweto. Accordingly, a study of this township fills in this absence in historical literature. Noordgesig Township is one of the original townships established on the farms Diepkloof and Klipspruit purchased by the Johannesburg City Council (JCC) during the 1930s, which would only in 1963, become collectively known as Soweto. Township areas in the southwestern areas of Johannesburg established prior to the apartheid era include Kliptown in 1904, Orlando East 1932, Pimville 1934, and Noordgesig 1940/41.Johannesburg Development Agency (JDA): 2012; National Archives of South Africa: Pretoria (hereafter SAB), Johannesburg City Council, Sub- economic Housing Loan: Coloured Township Adjoining Orlando, 10 March 1939, Source TPB, Vol. # 2494, Ref. # 25/11057 ‚Äì 27/110057. Moroka, Orlando West and Jabavu are also established prior to apartheid. The name for this first township is unclear because Kliptown and Klipspruit seem to be used interchangeably by various sites. See http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/history-soweto accessed 14 April 2014 (who name Klipspruit); accessed 14 April 2014 (who name Kliptown). The layout of Noordgesig was approved by the JCC as early as 23 March 1937.SAB, Source TPB, Vol.# 2494, Ref.# 25/11057 ‚Äì 27/110057, 10 March 1939. This article uses 1940/41 as the establishment date because the actual construction and completion of houses is during this period. Therefore, the history of this township must be included not only in writing any history tracing the origins of the south western areas of Johannesburg just prior to World War II (WWII), but also in studies of early black township formations on the Witwatersrand. Building black housing became a priority for the JCC, the Transvaal provincial government, and the Union government particularly near the end of the 1930s up to the end of the 1940s. The war would however curtail housing construction. The substantially increased rates of urban migration into the cities particularly those on the Witwatersrand preceding and during World War II, caused by the increased manufacturing industries and employment opportunities, culminated in a shortage of accommodation for new arrivals. Squatter camps became common during the early to mid-1940s and spread rapidly throughout what today is Orlando West and Moroka townships in Soweto. By the end of the 1940s the National Party (NP) government was faced with the challenge, greater than before, of trying to house these people. Motivated by the Group Areas Act of 1950, large numbers of people were displaced and forcibly removed from urban areas resulting in an unprecedented growth in new townships allocated in Soweto by the state.A. Christopher, The Atlas of Changing South Africa (London and New York: Routledge, 2001); JDA 2012; Hellmann, Soweto. The coloured population is small compared to the black population of South Africa and one reason why fewer studies on coloured housing in the urban history of Johannesburg exist. Contextualizing a historically coloured township requires an analysis of this identity. Noordgesig, can be understood as a locality made up of people, present and in the past, who in the majority are considered coloured, whether self-ascribed, or imposed, by virtue of their race, identity, class and complex relationship to ‚Äòblack‚Äô Soweto.The Township itself was designated for coloured occupation in the original government documents dated to the late 1930s. While secondary source material directly related to Noordgesig are scarce the same is not true of primary source materials which while not abundant were adequately available. Both secondary and primary source materials discussing coloureds in South Africa are however abundantly available. Soweto for many inhabitants of Noordgesig means the ‚Äòother‚Äô, which is both denied and accepted.

Hotesur is a firm that administers the hotels in El Calafate that belong to Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner and her family. Initially, it was suspected of not paying taxes, but the investigation headed by judge Claudio Bonadio led to suspicions about a possible case of money laundering, involving the businessman L√°zaro B√°ez as well. As a result, the government attempted to force an impeachment of Bonadio. Investigation The scandal began with an investigation by Periodismo para todos, a TV program of investigative journalism led by Jorge Lanata, aired on November 9, 2014. Lanata revealed that Hotesur, a firm owned by the president Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner to manage her hotels in Alto Calafate, had not paid taxes to the IGJ, nor filed the required financial statements for years. The program checked as well the registered headquarters of Hotesur, which appeared to be empty. Deputy Margarita Stolbizer made a formal denouncement to the judiciary the following day about the information revealed in the program. She also pointed out that Valle Mitre S.A., a firm owned by L√°zaro B√°ez, rented more than 1,100 rooms per month at Alto Calafate, but such rooms stayed unoccupied. B√°ez has earned hundreds of millions with infrastructure contracts signed with the Kirchners, and is suspected of money laundering at The Route of the K-Money scandal. Stolbizer also accused Cristina Fern√°ndez of malfeasance in office. The judge Claudio Bonadio ordered a search and seizure at the registered headquarters on November 20, and confirmed that the place was abandoned. Hotesur confirmed later that they had not filed statements, but did not mention the unoccupied rentals. Although Hotesur is not state-owned, their message was delivered by both media aligned with the government (such as Telam and F√∫tbol para todos) and the official Facebook and Twitter accounts of the presidency of the nation. Actions against the denouncers The main strategy of the government against the scandal was to start a big number of collateral scandals, expecting that the public interest in the original case would decrease, or that it would turn into a public perception of the whole political world as corrupt, instead of just the specific politicians involved in cases of corruption. The Council of Magistracy of the Nation reduced Bonadio's wages by 30%, with the vote of the supporters of the government within the council. He was sanctioned because of delays in two old cases. Bonadio may be impeached if he gets three sanctions. The opposing votes considered that the Council had not ruled over the delays in three years, and that the case against Bonadio had expired because of the statute of limitations. The lawyer Santiago Mansilla accused Margarita Stolbizer of illicit enrichment, a few days after she denounced the case. The case was received by judge Marcelo Mart√≠nez de Giorgi, and the prosecutor Ramiro Gonz√°lez asked for her oath to the AFIP to decide if he should proceed with the case. Silvina Mart√≠nez, a witness in the case, has also been denounced of several crimes by the deputy Andrea Garc√≠a. The AFIP denounced the bank HSBC for 4040 secret illegal Swiss accounts, as part of the strategy to generate collateral scandals. Reactions The president accused Claudio Bonadio of a similar fault, claiming that he has a stake in a company that had not filed statements in due time either. Luis D'Elia proposed to place Bonadio's head on a pike, in front of the courthouse. Deputy Carlos Kunkel and the chief of cabinet Jorge Capitanich said that Bonadio was attempting a coup d'√©tat; such conspiracy theories are usual in the Kirchnerite speech. Luis Mar√≠a Cabral, president of a national judges association, supported Bonadio. Luis Barrionuevo, head of the gastronomic union, announced that he would donate money to Bonadio to compensate the reduction of 30% of his wages. He mentioned that there are employees in Alto Calafate that belong to his union, who may testify in the case if needed. He mentioned that the hotels were reported to be fully occupied even during the Patagonian crisis with volcanic ash.

Works = The Pont Albert-Louppe between Brest and Plougastel-Daoulas = The Albert Louppe bridge crosses the √âlorn estuary and joins Brest with the √éle de Plougastel. It is made from reinforced cement. The river separates la Cornouaille from L√©on and Quillivic's sculptures of couples from both districts decorate the bridge. The bridge had been opened in 1930 but was replaced in 1994 by the Pont de l‚ÄôIroise when it could no longer cope with the volume of traffic. The Albert Louppe bridge was retained but for pedestrians only and Quillivic's sculptures remain on view. = \\"La Bigoud√®ne\\" = Quillivic's statue \\"La Bigoud√®ne\\" at Pors-Poulhan marks the border between the areas of Pays Bigouden and Cap Sizun. =Statue in honour of Commandant Charcot = This statue depicting the explorer Charcot stands in St Malo's Jardin de Solidor in the Quai S√©bastopol. = \\"Le Groupe des sonneurs bretons\\" = In 1907, Quillivic won the Gold Medal at the Salon des Beaux-Arts for the composition \\"Le Groupe des sonneurs bretons\\" depicting two Breton Pipers. This is shown here. = \\"La Brodeuse de Pont-l'Abb√©\\" = With this work Quillivic won a bursary which provided funds for travel to North Africa and Italy to enable him study sculptures at first hand. It can be seen in the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Quimper. Several of Quillivic's works are preserved in this art museum, including his sculpture \\"L'appel de la mer\\" ('The call of the sea'), which was initially intended for the Breton pavilion at the 1939 Exposition des arts d√©coratifs in Paris. The semi naked female figure was considered too provocative and was replaced by a Madonna and Child by Jules- Charles Le Bozec. The gallery also holds other statues depicting the artist's mother and portraits of heads of children. = Monument to Ren√© Laennec = This work dates to 1942 and depicts the French inventor of the stethoscope. = Bust of Prosper Roux = The poet spent several years at Guerlesquin and this Quillivic monument was erected in his honour in 1919. = \\"Bretonne\\" = This work in granite can be seen in the Montbrison townhall. = Monument to Joseph Hall√©guen = Quillivic was commissioned to execute a bronze depicting a portrait of Hall√©guen, the politician and French Resistance member for his tomb in Quimper's St Joseph cemetery. = The Paris studio of Ren√© Quillivic = Quillivic had a studio in Paris' boulevard de Montmorency and the entrance to this studio is flanked by two statues representing women from Ploar√© and Audierne. The fa√ßade of the building is decorated with Quillivic ceramics and the door knocker is shaped in the head of a woman. = War memorials = Quillivic worked on many war memorials. Here are some details although the listing may not cover all such memorials.  Le m√©morial aux marins morts pour la France  Le m√©morial aux marins morts pour la France At the summit of a huge column, 17 metres in height, is the head of a Breton woman, modelled by Quillivic's mother, mourning the death of a loved one; a son or a husband, a \\"Mater Dolorosa\\". The four sides of the pillar are decorated with Quillivic bas-reliefs. The monument was inaugurated on 12 June 1927 and stands at the most westerly point of the Cap Saint Mathieu. The monument stands by the remains of an old fort and over the years the site of the monument has become a memorial dedicated to all the sailors who died for France in the 20th century, a cenotaph for those lost at sea and whose bodies were never recovered. There is a crypt with a permanent exhibition of photographs of men lost at sea  Coray War Memorial  It seems that it was Quillivic's habit to select a member of the family of one particular name listed on a commune's memorial and to catch their likeness in the sculpture on which he was working thus making it \\"special\\" for each community. For the Coray memorial, he chose a 20-year-old girl called Marie-Louise Maguet, whose father was one of the dead listed. She is dressed in an authentic local costume and hat. She carries in her hand a branch from an oak tree, a symbol of wisdom and power. She stands next to the pedestal on which stands Quillivic's sculpture of a standing soldier.  Bannalec War Memorial  For Bannalec's memorial, Quillivic sculpted the figure of a woman, this time the likeness being based on Marie Le Bourhis the sister of Jean Le Bourhis, an aviator who was killed in aerial combat in 1916. She wears traditional Breton dress. The work dates to 1921 and stands in the Place Charles de Gaulle by Bannalec's marie. There is also a bronze bas-relief which depicts a soldier and a cross.  Ch√¢teaulin War Memorial  Here Quillivic depicts a standing soldier in front of an artillery shell. The memorial dates to 1921. The memorial stands in Chateaulin's Place du 2e bataillon Stalingrad by the √âglise Saint Idunet.  Roscoff War Memorial  The war memorial stands in the old \\"cimeti√®re marin du Vil\\" in the avenue Tristan Corbi√®re and has two bronze plaques by Quillivic dating to 1920. One depicts a marine and the other an infantryman.  Fouesnant War Memorial  Fouesnant war memorial Here Quillivic modelled the woman featuring in his sculpture on Marie-Jeanne Kerangel who had lost three sons in the 1914-1918 war. Quillivic had shown the sculpture at the 1922 Salon de la Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts. It is carved from kersantite. In 1925 a reduction in pottery was made by Verlingue-Bollor√© as a limited edition. Two hundred and nineteen names are listed as victims of the 1914-1918 war and later the names of those killed in the Second World War and in Indochina and Algeria were added.  Plouhinec War Memorial  Quillivic was born and brought up in Plouhinec and used his own mother as the model for the Breton woman, the centre-piece of the memorial. His mother wears the traditional head-dress of Cap Sizun. = Other works in Plouhinec = Apart from the war memorial, the commune also has a bronze bust of Quillivic's mother in a traditional head-dress, this on public display near his family home. Also in Plouhinec are a sculpture of Saint Jacques, and an uncompleted Calvary, or carved cross. = War memorials (continued) =  Plouy√© War Memorial  This memorial stands at the entrance to Plouy√©'s cemetery. Quillivic carved the Breton woman wearing mourning clothes from an 8-ton block of kersantite.  Sca√´r War Memorial  On one side of a pedestal, Quillivic sculpted a soldier and on the opposite side a Sca√´r woman in the local dress. As a model for the woman, Quillivic used a local girl, Marguerite Belleguic, who ran a kiosk outside the church. The mairie have kept the two maquettes for the soldier and the woman.  Carhaix-Plouguer War Memorial  The Carhaix-Plouguer memorial in front of the √âglise Saint-Tremeur Quillivic worked on this memorial, which stands in Carhaix-Plouguer's Rue de l'√âglise in front of the √âglise Saint-Tremeur, in 1929. He sculpted a standing soldier using dark granite who is stood on a pedestal whilst below a second statue depicts a Breton woman her hand on her chest and clearly in mourning. The communes of Carhaix and Plouguer merged to form Carhaix-Plouguer in 1957 but they had their own war memorials and Quillivic worked on that in Carhaix.  Ploz√©vet War Memorial  Ploz√©vet For Ploz√©vet's 1922 memorial which is located in the Rue d'Audierne by the √âglise Saint-D√©met, Quillivic carved the figure of a Breton carrying a Bigouden hat in his hand, the man based on Ploz√©vet's S√©bastien Le Gouill who had lost his three sons and a son-in-law in the 1914-1918 war. He stands next to a menhir.  Pont-Croix War Memorial  Pont-Croix's war memorial is situated behind the Coll√©giale and dates to 1922. A woman in local dress is Quillivic's composition here and she stands, lost in thought, with a soldier's helmet laying at her feet. At the base of the pedestal is the inscription in the Breton language which translates as \\"Our blood for the motherland, our soul for God\\".  Saint-Pol-de-L√©on War Memorial  Saint-Pol-de-L√©on war memorial This was the first memorial to the dead of the 1914-1918 war erected in Finist√®re, Quillivic working with the architect Charles Chaussepied. It dates to 1919. The memorial was placed near an existing Calvary and a semi-circular wall to which were affixed the \\"Stations of the cross\\" by Yann Larhantec. They added their composition, a most imaginative one, depicting four women in Breton dress who support a slab on which lies a soldier. The four Breton women are placed at the corners of the slab They wear different headdresses and Quillivic endeavoured to embrace \\"all social groups and ages\\".  Guiclan War Memorial  This memorial dates to 1922 and bears two bas-reliefs. One depicts a man and a woman in mourning and above this the other depicts a soldier in profile. The implication is that the couple are the parents of the soldier who has lost his life.  Pleumeur-Bodou in Morbihan War Memorial  This 1922 memorial has two bas-reliefs by Quillivic, one depicts a soldier and the other a sailor.  Loud√©ac War Memorial  Here Quillivic features a soldier and a woman in Breton dress. It seems the woman's image was based on that of C√©cile Ollitrault a young woman from Loud√©ac who lived in Paris and came along to Quillivic's studio for the model to be made.  Pont-Scorff War Memorial  For this 1919 memorial Quillivic produced a work inspired by ancient Breton calvaries with a medallion depicting Henri de Polignac the ex-mayor of Pont-Scorff set into the cross as well as the names of those honoured and a text written in the Breton language. = Woodcuts = Quillivic was an accomplished engraver and his woodcuts are highly valued. = Ceramics = Quillivic's pottery figures are well regarded and he worked with several producers of \\"faience\\" Part of the Carhaix-Plouguer war memorial References Category:20th-century French sculptors Category:French male sculptors Category:Sculptors from Brittany ","title":"List of works by Ren√© Quillivic"},{"id":"44660722","title":"Vesna Tominac Mataƒçiƒá"},{"id":"44660728","text":"Str√¢mba may refer to the following rivers in Romania: * Str√¢mba, a village in the commune Josenii B√¢rgƒÉului, Bistri»õa-NƒÉsƒÉud County * Str√¢mba, tributary of the Amaradia in Gorj County * Str√¢mba, tributary of the Dorofei in Olt County * Str√¢mba, tributary of the Ili»ôua in Bistri»õa-NƒÉsƒÉud County * Str√¢mba, tributary of the Ilva in Bistri»õa-NƒÉsƒÉud County * Str√¢mba, tributary of the Lep»ôa in Vrancea County * Str√¢mba (Mure»ô), tributary of the Mure»ô in Harghita County * Str√¢mba, tributary of the Cornet in Timi»ô County * Str√¢mba, tributary of the Olt in Sibiu County * Str√¢mba, tributary of the Printre VƒÉi in SƒÉlaj County * Str√¢mba, tributary of the R√¢u»ôor in Arge»ô County * Str√¢mba, tributary of the SƒÉlƒÉu»õa in Bistri»õa-NƒÉsƒÉud County * Str√¢mba, tributary of the Sebe»ô in Sibiu County * Str√¢mba, tributary of the »òercaia in Bra»ôov County * Str√¢mba, tributary of the Suciu in Maramure»ô County * Str√¢mba, tributary of the TazlƒÉu in BacƒÉu County * Str√¢mba, tributary of the Tismana in Gorj County * Str√¢mba, tributary of the Tur in Satu Mare County  See also  * Str√¢mbu (disambiguation) * Valea Str√¢mbƒÉ (disambiguation) ","title":"Str√¢mba"},{"id":"44660758","text":"John Frederick Lewis, The Reception, 1873 This an incomplete list of artists who have produced works on Orientalist subjects, drawn from the Islamic world or other parts of Asia.This is a composite listing compiled from multiple sources including: Davies, K., Orientalists: Western Artists in Arabia, the Sahara, Persia and India, New York, Laynfaroh, 2005; Juler, C., Les Orientalistes de l'Ecole Italienne, Edicion Internationale, Paris, ACR,1994; Thornton, L., The Orientalists: Painter Travellers, [Edition en langue anglaise], Paris, ACR, 1994; Ackerman, G.M., American Orientalists, ACR, 1994; Meagher, J., \\"Orientalism in Nineteenth-Century Art,\\" [The Metropolitan Museum of Art Essay], Online: http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/euoAckerr/hd_euor.htm; Orientalist Painting http://www.visual‚Äìarts‚Äìcork.com/history‚Äìof‚Äìart/orientalist‚Äìpainting.htm; Pouillon, F., Dictionnaire des Orientalistes de Langue Fran√ßaise, KARTHALA, 2008; Hannavy, J.Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Photography, Routledge, 2013; Abykayeva-Tiesenhausen, A. and Hannavy, J.

For example, the Spanish artist, Joaqu√≠n Sorolla y Bastida, is listed under \\"S\\" for Sorolla, the paternal family name.

He took part in the preparation of the Sonderkommando uprising. Biography The father of Leon Cohen was a well-off, successful merchant, who imported goods from Germany and Austria and had commercial relations with small merchants in Brussels. Leon Cohen had two sisters, Agnes and Margot, and one brother, Robert. He went to the Leon Gatenyo business school, a French-German institution. He was given a strong French education and learned the finest French literature, because the teacher was the principal and founder of the Chevalier de la Liaison Francaise school. After he graduated, he first worked at the Thessaloniki international fair. Later on, he worked for Decca Records, an enterprise that sold records and radio sets. Before the occupation, he was an official supplier for the Greek Ministry of Defense. Later on, he was drafted into the Greek army. He was arrested in 1942, like thousands of young Jewish men, and was sent to the German prison in Thessaloniki, from which he escaped. On January 15, 1943, he married his first wife, Germaine Perahia, the daughter of Yehoshua Perahia, owner of the Bank Union (along with Joseph Nehama) in Thessaloniki. The Jews of Thessaloniki were sent into a ghetto from which he escaped with his wife. He arrived in Athens and was arrested by the Germans, while his wife and her parents hid themselves.Ya'akov Gabai: I'll Get Out of Here! in Gideon Greif, We wept without tears, Yale University Press, 2005, p. 209: One the men who was in the Sonderkommando, a Greek named Leon Cohen, is still alive. He was married to the daughter of a bank manager in Salonika. When Cohen was arrested and sent to Auschwitz, his wife fled with her father. He was sent to the Haidari concentration camp. =Experiences in Auschwitz= Ruin of Krematorium III in Birkenau Entrance to Krematorium III in Birkenau He was deported from Athens on April 2, 1944, and arrived at Auschwitz on April 11. His mother and his younger sister Margot, who was pregnant, were murdered upon their arrival. Cohen is one of the 320 Greek men selected for labor (serial numbers from 182,440 to 182,759). His number is 182,492. As he could speak German, it was a vital asset, considering that most of the Sephardic Jews from Thessaloniki could only speak Greek, Ladino, Italian, or French. They were isolated in the camp most of the time, in particular with regards to the other Jews who were speaking mostly in Yiddish.Shaul Chazan: Life Didn't Matter Anymore, Death Was Too Close in Gideon Greif, We wept without tears, Yale University Press, 2005, p. 263: I remember that Leon Cohen was the only one of us who spoke German.. After spending two days in the Zentral Sauna in Birkenau, he and the other Greek men lived in the Block 12 of the M√§nnerquarant√§ne Lager from April 13 to May 11. Then he was selected, along with 100 Greeks, to be part of the SonderkommandoSee Auschwitz by Tal Bruttmann : as early as 16 May 1944, four convoys, each carrying 3,000 Jews from Hungary in 45 wagons, had to leave Hungary daily for Auschwitz. After being removed from Auschwitz in November 1943 by order of Himmler, Rudolf H√∂ss was called back to the camp commandment to prepare the site for the scheduled mass arrival (Aktion H√∂ss). On 9 May, orders are given to increase the number of prisoners of the Sonderkommando and Kanada Kommando (see Auschwitz Chronicle by Danuta Czech). In mid-April, the number of Sonderkommando prisoners stood at 207. On May 15, a contingent of 100 men is taken from the quarantine camp among the Greek Jews selected on April 11. After a few days at the cremation pits of the Bunker 2 and at the Krematorium IV, he was permanently assigned to Krematorium III as \\"dentist\\" or Z√§hnekontrolle (i.e. examining the mouths of the people who have been murdered and ripping out their gold teeth).Shlomo Venezia & B√©atrice Prasquier, Inside the Gas Chambers: Eight Months in the Sonderkommando of Auschwitz , Polity, 2011.See The dentist by Chaim Marin and Razia Israeli, a play for an actress based on \\"We Wept without Tears\\" by Gideon Greif, with actress Razzia Israeli.

As with many witnesses, he remembered the cruelty of the Hauptscharf√ºhrer Otto Moll. At the Krematorium III, he met the French painter David Ol√®re and was very close with French industrialist Hersz Strasfogel.Leon Cohen : From Greece to Birkenau p. 53. Picture of Hersz Strasfogel in Sonderkommando Auschwitz channel's video : . Hersz Strasfogel on the Shoah Memorial in Paris : He took part in the preparation of the Sonderkommando uprising, alongside Yaacov Kaminski, Lemke Cha√Øm Pliszko, Dawid Kotchak, Giuseppe Baruch, Leibl Paul Katz, Marcel Nadjari and Alberto Errera. But when it happened on October 7, 1944, the prisoners of the Krematorium III could not take part in the rebellion and were quickly surrounded by the Germans. After the end of the extermination by gas at mid-November, Cohen and his comrades were drafted into the Abbruchkommando Krematorium, which means the unit in charge of the demolition of the Krematoriums (about 70 prisoners). On January 17, 1945, the SS begun to evacuate Auschwitz, and the few thousand inmates that could walk were filed out of the camp on a death march. Although the members of the Sonderkommando were not allowed to leave the camp, Cohen and other members of the Sonderkommando mingled with the crowd of prisoners (about a hundred members of the Sonderkommando escaped from the camp this way). He was sent to the Mauthausen concentration camp. He was deported to Melk, Linz, Gusen and Ebensee concentration camps from which he was liberated on May 6, 1945 by the 80th Infantry Division of the US Army. Almost dead, he was treated in hospital (between 40 and 50 former members of the Sonderkommando survived after the camps were freed). =After Auschwitz= He went back to Thessaloniki in August 1945.

He received no reparations from Germany, evidently due to bureaucratic foot dragging or negligence. His health deteriorated and he died in 1989 in Bat Yam.

Active for more than fifty years, he has been responsible for some of the most significant buildings in South East Asia, in the modern, postmodern, and deconstructivist styles. He is considered the father of Malaysian architecture of the second half of the twentieth century. Early life Hijjas was born in Singapore in 26 September 1936. His Chinese mother was raised in Indonesia and then married a Singaporean Javanese. He and went to Raffles Institute to continue his secondary education, and he was then granted a scholarship by the Australian Government to study at the University of Adelaide; he eventually graduated from the University of Melbourne. He moved to Malaysia in 1967 and founded the first professional degree program in Malaysia, The School of Art and Architecture at MARA Institute of Technology. In 1977, he founded his own practice, Hijjas Kasturi Associates Sdn (HKAS). Career Hijjas started as a Draughtsman with the Singapore Housing Trust in 1956, preparing the Master Plan for Queenstown, and lowcost flats for Singapore. After three years, he joined the South Australian Housing Trust as a Draughtsman preparing the Master Plan for Elizabeth Town,South Australia, and various housing schemes. In 1961, Hijjas became an Architectural Assistant with Brown & Davis, South Australia, working on hospital planning, commercial and religious buildings and housing. In 1965, he became an architect with Hume Proprietary Ltd., Melbourne, Australia planning the construction of factories, warehouses and district offices. In 1966, Hijjas returned to Singapore and became an Architect/Planner with Urban Renewal Department of the Housing and Development Board of Singapore, in charge of the central transportation terminus study, planning for Ministry of Internal Defence Headquarters and city Development. However, in 1967, he left Singapore for Malaysia and become the Team leader for feasibility study for the establishment of InstitutTeknoloji MARA. He was also the Founding Head of, School of Art and Architecture, Institut Teknologi MARA (ITM) and the Master Planner for ITM Complex at Shah Alam. He was also the architect for MARA Vocational Institute, Malacca. In 1969, he was the founding principal partner of AkitekBersekutu, subsequently AkitekBersekutu Malaysia. He was also the Founding principal of Hijjas Kasturi Associates Sdn., Architects and Planners. Notable buildings Hijjas was the architect of Wisma Equity one of the most prominent brutalist buildings constructed in Malaysia. Located at 150, Jalan Ampang, 50450, Kuala Lumpur, it is on a prominent site and was completed in 1982. It was officially opened in 1983 by Dato Elyasbin Omar. Wisma Equity is an 11 floors office building including a lower ground. It is made of exposed concrete, and the building appears to defy gravity and structure by becoming larger as it rises. In this regard, it bears a formal similarity to Marcel Breuer's Whitney Museum in New York City. Major buildings designed by Hijjas Kasturi Associates include the Menara Maybank (1989), Tabung Haji (1986), Telekom Tower (2001), Putrajaya International Convention Centre (2003) and the 4G11 Tower in Putrajaya (2008).

The circle candidates are produced by ‚Äúvoting‚Äù in the Hough parameter space and then selecting local maxima in an accumulator matrix. It is a specialization of Hough transform. Theory In a two-dimensional space, a circle can be described by: :\\\\left( x-a \\\\right)^2 + \\\\left( y-b \\\\right)^2 = r^2 \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ (1) where (a,b) is the center of the circle, and r is the radius. If a 2D point (x,y) is fixed, then the parameters can be found according to (1). The parameter space would be three dimensional, (a, b, r). And all the parameters that satisfy (x, y) would lie on the surface of an inverted right-angled cone whose apex is at (x, y, 0). In the 3D space, the circle parameters can be identified by the intersection of many conic surfaces that are defined by points on the 2D circle. This process can be divided into two stages. The first stage is fixing radius then find the optimal center of circles in a 2D parameter space. The second stage is to find the optimal radius in a one dimensional parameter space. =Find parameters with known radius R= If the radius is fixed, then the parameter space would be reduced to 2D (the position of the circle center). For each point (x, y) on the original circle, it can define a circle centered at (x, y) with radius R according to (1). The intersection point of all such circles in the parameter space would be corresponding to the center point of the original circle. 900px Consider 4 points on a circle in the original image (left). The circle Hough transform is shown in the right. Note that the radius is assumed to be known. For each (x,y) of the four points (white points) in the original image, it can define a circle in the Hough parameter space centered at (x, y) with radius r. An accumulator matrix is used for tracking the intersection point. In the parameter space, the voting number of points through which the circle passing would be increased by one. Then the local maxima point (the red point in the center in the right figure) can be found. The position (a, b) of the maxima would be the center of the original circle. =Multiple circles with known radius R= Multiple circles with same radius can be found with the same technique. 1000px Note that, in the accumulator matrix (right fig), there would be at least 3 local maxima points. =Accumulator matrix and voting= In practice, an accumulator matrix is introduced to find the intersection point in the parameter space. First, we need to divide the parameter space into ‚Äúbuckets‚Äù using a grid and produce an accumulator matrix according to the grid. The element in the accumulator matrix denotes the number of ‚Äúcircles‚Äù in the parameter space that passing through the corresponding grid cell in the parameter space. The number is also called ‚Äúvoting number‚Äù. Initially, every element in the matrix is zeros. Then for each ‚Äúedge‚Äù point in the original space, we can formulate a circle in the parameter space and increase the voting number of the grid cell which the circle passing through. This process is called ‚Äúvoting‚Äù. After voting, we can find local maxima in the accumulator matrix. The positions of the local maxima are corresponding to the circle centers in the original space. =Find circle parameter with unknown radius= Since the parameter space is 3D, the accumulator matrix would be 3D, too. We can iterate through possible radii; for each radius, we use the previous technique. Finally, find the local maxima in the 3D accumulator matrix. Accumulator array should be A[x,y,r] in the 3D space. Voting should be for each pixels, radius and theta A[x,y,r] += 1 The algorithm : # For each A[a,b,r] = 0; # Process the filtering algorithm on image Gaussian Blurring, convert the image to grayscale ( grayScaling), make Canny operator, The Canny operator gives the edges on image. # Vote the all possible circles in accumulator. # The local maximum voted circles of Accumulator A gives the circle Hough space. # The maximum voted circle of Accumulator gives the circle. The Incrementing for Best Candidate : For each A[a,b,r] = 0; // fill with zeroes initially, instantiate 3D matrix For each cell(x,y) For each theta t = 0 to 360 // the possible theta 0 to 360 b = y ‚Äì r * sin(t * PI / 180); //polar coordinate for center (convert to radians) a = x ‚Äì r * cos(t * PI / 180); //polar coordinate for center (convert to radians) A[a,b,r] +=1; //voting end end Examples =Find circles in a shoe-print= Find circles in a shoe-print The original picture (right) is first turned into a binary image (left) using a threshold and Gaussian filter. Then edges (mid) are found from it using canny edge detection. After this, all the edge points are used by the Circle Hough Transform to find underlying circle structure. Limitations Since the parameter space of the CHT is three dimensional, it may require lots of storage and computation. Choosing a bigger grid size can ameliorate this problem. However, choosing an appropriate grid size is difficult. Since too coarse a grid can lead to large values of the vote being obtained falsely because many quite different structures correspond to a single bucket. Too fine a grid can lead to structures not being found because votes resulting from tokens that are not exactly aligned end up in different buckets, and no bucket has a large vote. Also, the CHT is not very robust to noise. Extensions =Adaptive Hough Transform= J. Illingworth and J. Kittler J. Illingworth and J. Kittler, ‚ÄúThe Adaptive Hough Transform,‚Äù PAMI-9 , Issue: 5, 1987, pp 690-698 introduced this method for implementing Hough Transform efficiently. The AHT uses a small accumulator array and the idea of a flexible iterative \\"coarse to fine\\" accumulation and search strategy to identify significant peaks in the Hough parameter spaces. This method is substantially superior to the standard Hough Transform implementation in both storage and computational requirements. Application =People Counting= Since the head would be similar to a circle in an image, CHT can be used for detecting heads in a picture, so as to count the number of persons in the image.Hong Liu, Yueliang Qian and Shouxun Lin , ‚ÄúDETECTING PERSONS USING HOUGH CIRCLE TRANSFORM IN SURVEILLANCE VIDEO‚Äù =Brain Aneurysm Detection= Modified Hough Circle Transform (MHCT) is used on the image extracted from Digital Subtraction Angiogram (DSA) to detect and classify aneurysms type.

The film is a remake of the English film Unleashed. Plot Bangaram (Jagapati Babu) loses his memory in a childhood traumatic incident and is raised by the evil Rudra (Ashish Vidyarthi), who strictly keeps him in a cage in a cellar of his house and raises him into a ruthless fighter who is otherwise quite unkempt and uncivilized, cannot even speak properly, and eats just raw meat. Rudra uses him human bomb when he gets into problems to fight to kill. When Rudra takes off the holy Hindu wedding chain (Mangalsutra) tied to his right hand, off goes Bangaram like a raging bull, an unstoppable machine using the only ultimate weapon he knows: his body. He also uses him to make money by entering him in an underground fight club where the winner is the one who survives. But, when a turf war ends up in a bloody carnage, Bangaram escapes and is taken in by a kind family consisting of blind piano tuner Vasudev (Kalabhavan Mani) and his teenage stepdaughter Gayathri (Neha Oberoi). Slowly, they teach Bangaram how to be a real person. How to behave and act in the civil society. They also teach him the delineation between good and bad. They even give him a new name Guru. They also allow Bangaram to explore his love of the piano, where a specific tune haunts him, bringing back repressed memories from his long-ago past. In the process, both Guru and Gayathri fall in love. Gayathri is drawn towards Guru, attracted by his innocent and na√Øve ways of looking at life and things. Just when, Guru thinks he has escaped from his former life, he is pulled back in. But he is no longer the trained dog Rudra thinks he is.

Mayhew is one of the only four living knights of the very exclusive Military William Order, the highest honour of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Conscripted in 1939 Mayhew served as an officer of the 1st Battalion of the Suffolk Regiment. He commanded a company which landed in Normandy in 1944 and fought in the North West Europe Campaign. Mayhew was injured while fighting in the Netherlands. He resumed command of his company before being injured again and returning to the United Kingdom. In 1946 Mayhew was knighted by Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, receiving the Knight fourth class of the Military William Order. The chapter of the order lost contact with him in the 1980s until he was seen wearing his medal at a memorial service in 2011. He subsequently became an active member of the order. Early life Mayhew was born in Suffolk on 18 January 1917, as the son of a farmer. He attended Framlingham College. From 1936 to 1939 he played cricket for the Suffolk County Cricket Club. Military service Second Lieutenant Mayhew, 1940‚Äì41 At the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 Mayhew was conscripted. In January 1940, he entered the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and following completion of his training became a second lieutenant in the 1st Battalion of the Suffolk Regiment, 8th Infantry Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division. Originally scheduled to cross to Southern France in 1940 before the Fall of France, the battalion stayed in the United Kingdom, and from 1942 they began preparing for an invasion of France and simulating landings. On 6 June 1944 Mayhew commanded a company equipped with 13 armoured infantry carriers that landed at Sword Beach in Normandy, on D-Day. His unit captured the Hillman Battery, a 12-bunker complex defended by 150 men of the 736 Infantry Regiment, as part of the liberation of Colleville-sur-Orne. They then fought during the Battle for Caen, and on 28 June were part of Operation Charnwood, fighting a battle at Ch√¢teau de la Londe, which left 161 dead on the British side. His company liberated Flers and moved on towards Belgium and the Netherlands. The 1st Battalion were supposed to meet airlifted troops at Arnhem as part of Operation Market Garden, which failed however. During battles in the Netherlands Mayhew's company took part in the liberation of Weert (22 September), Venray and Overloon (16‚Äì19 October). In Weert, Captain Mayhew was assisted by local resistance fighters. To locate German positions they often had to expose themselves to enemy fire, which resulted in several injuries among the company. On 16 October 1944, during the Battle of Overloon, Mayhew was injured by shells while creating bridges for tanks across a stream at Venray. He was sent to a hospital in Brussels, but returned to his company, against the orders of his doctors, in fear that his command might be given away to someone else. On 25 February 1945 he was again injured while advancing towards the Rhine, and was evacuated back to the United Kingdom. Knighthood After the Second World War the government of the Netherlands wished to reward foreign soldiers for their services in liberating the country. They requested that foreign governments send recommendations for honours. In October 1945, the United Kingdom recommended Mayhew for the Order of the Bronze Lion or Medal of the Bronze Cross. The Dutch government however decided that a higher honour should be awarded. On 24 April 1946, by Royal Decree, Mayhew was knighted by Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, receiving the Knight fourth class of the Military William Order. The Order is the highest and oldest military honour of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, bestowed for \\"performing excellent acts of Bravery, Leadership and Loyalty in battle\\". In the words of the royal decree:Maalderink, p.282 Due to his injuries Mayhew was unable to travel to the Dutch embassy in London. Instead he received the honour by mail. As of August 2018, Mayhew is the oldest of only four knights still living. Later life Mayhew (second from the right) with fellow knights of the Military William Order in 2012 After the war Mayhew became a representative in artificial fertilizers. In 1965, in honour of the 150-year anniversary of the Military William Order, Mayhew was received by Queen Juliana of the Netherlands at Huis ten Bosch. In the 1980s contact with the chapter of the order was lost when Mayhew moved. The last contact with the order was in 1982, when he received a book about the Military William Order by mail. Mayhew was eventually presumed dead and went unnoticed when he attended the unveiling of a monument in honour of the Suffolk Regiment in Weert in 1994. While attending a memorial service at Venray in September 2011, Mayhew was seen by Dutch medal researcher Roel Rijks and Henny Meijer wearing the decoration of the Military William Order. Only seven knights were known to be alive at the time and held in the highest regard, with the knighting of Marco Kroon in 2009, the first new knight in over half a century, receiving broad national media attention. As such, the discovery of an eighth knight was widely published. The chapter of the order confirmed his membership and informed the Minister of Defence and Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, the grandmaster of the order. The Dutch embassy in London sent a representative to Mayhew's home to reestablish contact. In May 2012 Mayhew visited the Netherlands where he was received by Queen Beatrix. He met with the other Dutch knights, and was presented with an appreciation medal from the municipality of Venray.Door de Wapenbroeders herontdekte Ridder Militaire Willems-Orde door Venray gehuldigd (in Dutch). Nieuwsbrief Bond van Wapenbroeders. July 2012. p.4 Since 2012 Mayhew has visited the Netherlands several times and has been active as a member of the Military William Order. In May 2013 he was an honorary guest at the annual Liberation Day ceremony in Wageningen, and visited the Overloon War Museum. In May 2014 Mayhew opened the annual Liberation Day celebrations in Wageningen, attended by over 1800 veterans and 120,000 visitors. Later that month Mayhew baptised tulips in London, a gift from the Netherlands to mark the 70-year anniversary of Operation Market Garden, attended by representatives from the Dutch, British, Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, Polish and US armed forces. On 6 December 2014 he was an honorary guest at the knighting of Gijs Tuinman, one of only two knights present, out of only four alive at the time. The event, which was broadcast live on Dutch national television, saw Mayhew welcoming Tuinman as a new member of the order. In honour of his 100th birthday, king Willem- Alexander of the Netherlands sent Mayhew a congratulatory letter in January 2017, which was delivered by the Dutch ambassador to the United Kingdom. Mayhew was a guest at Buckingham Palace during the state visit of king Willem- Alexander of the Netherlands and queen M√°xima to the United Kingdom in October 2018. In 2018 a book was published about his life with an introduction by king Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands. As a D-Day veteran and member of Suffolk Regiment, Mayhew attended several memorial services in Normandy in 1994, 2004 and 2014. These services were organised by a local association called \\"Les Amis du Suffolk R√©giment\\" (French: Friends of the Suffolk Regiment) and the municipality of Colleville-Montgomery, which was liberated by the Suffolk Regiment in 1944. In 2014, Mayhew met with a former German defender of Hillman Battery and also with a grandson of Colonel Ludwig Krug, the commander of Hillman Battery.  Personal life  Mayhew and his wife in 2012 Mayhew is married and lives with his second wife Patricia in Norwich. Prior to this he was married to Rosalie Elizabeth \\"Betty\\" n√©e Howell, now deceased. He has three children from his marriage to Betty, a son Roger, born in 1940 and twin daughters, Susan and Gillian born in 1945. He has six grandchildren from his marriage with Betty and is a great-grandfather.

Name The Chinese name N√°nh«éi J√¨guƒ´ N√®if«é Zhu√°n literally means \\"An Account of the Inner Law Sent Home from the Southern Sea\\", in reference to Buddhism's idea of dharma as a cosmic law and the Chinese name for the South China Sea. The work has appeared in English under various translations of varying literalness, from Accounts of the Inner Law Sent Home from the South Sea to Takakusu's Record of the Buddhist Religion as Practised in India and the Malay Archipelago to Record of Buddhist Practices.. Content The book records Yijing's stay at Nalanda, a Buddhist MahƒÅvihƒÅra in North-eastern India, and describes the life and practices of the monks therein. It also provides geographical and religious information on countries in the South Sea area, of which there were more than ten, during the Tang dynasty. It recorded that, for example, Buddhism flourished in the countries of the South Sea, and most of these countries practiced Hinayana Buddhism, but Buddhism in Funan had been eliminated after it was conquered. The book is divided into forty sections. Unlike his predecessor Xuanzang's travelogue, which gives descriptions of the area he visited, Yijing prefers to restrict itself to descriptions of the customs, rules, and regulations of Buddhism as it was practised in its homeland. His detailed account of monastic rules and practices is valuable for the study of Buddhism and Buddhist literature of the period as many of the sources he cited are now lost.

The art market operates in an economic model that considers more than supply and demand: it is a hybrid type of prediction market where art is bought and sold for values based not only on a work's perceived cultural value, but on both its past monetary value as well as its predicted future value. The market has been described as one where producers don't make work primarily for sale, where buyers often have no idea of the value of what they buy, and where middlemen routinely claim reimbursement for sales of things they have never seen to buyers they have never dealt with.Plattner, Stuart, A Most Ingenious Paradox: The Market for Contemporary Fine Art, American Anthropologist 100(2):482-493, 1998.

Economics Unlike the volumes in the securities market where millions of people and firms participate in buying and selling financial interests, or the commodities market where measures of raw or primary products are exchanged using standardized contracts, art market activity largely follows the demands of a more limited array of private collectors, museums, and large corporate interests as the principal market participants. The art market sees itself as a microcosm: it lists its collectors in the hundreds, as opposed to the securities market which has millions of participants. ARTnews: The Top Ten , The ARTnews 200 Top Collectors . One art writer answered the question: \\"Do you see the art world as a microcosm of other broader, power communities?\\" with the following observation: \\"I'm not sure if it's a microcosm or the shape of things to come. Its manic internationalism.\\" Insider Art V Magazine, 2008-11-12, vmagazine.com. Accessed 20 June 2012. Corporate collectors, however, can have a disparately large market impact, for instance, Spear's reported in 2015 that British Rail began investing in art for its pension fund beginning in 1974 (prior to privatization), spending about ¬£40M or approximately 3% of its funds on art, before selling those assets between 1987-1999.Lindsay, Ivan, Go Figure, Spear's, spearswms.com, 21 January 2011; free archived version. Accessed 17 November 2015. British Rail Pension realized an annualized return of 11.3% because of a number of factors particular to the market at the time. British Rail's efforts realized profits, particularly due to the Impressionist portfolio, but the collection was liquidated because it came to be seen as an illegitimate investment area, particularly as alternative investments became available. Also, because original artworks are not fungible like stocks, they have valuation challenges not similarly affecting securities,Baumol, William J., Unnatural Value: Or Art Investment as Floating Crap Game , The American Economic Review, 76:2 (May 1986), pp. 10-14, Papers and Proceedings of the Ninety-Eighth Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association,; Journal of Arts Management and Law (now The Journal of Arts Management, Law, and Society), 15:3, 1985, pp. 47-60. . with dynamics of what Karpik calls singularities. Thus, because the art market's participants are far more limited in number than the securities or commodities markets, because artworks are not fungible, and because art valuation relies to a great extent on the advice and enthusiasm of a variety of specialized market analysts, these limitations each in turn dictate the size of the market and increase the risk that some items may be over or undervalued. The art market moves in cycles with activity generally peaking in the spring and autumn when the major auction houses traditionally schedule auctions, and results in the market being seasonal rather than ongoing.Art Market Cycles, artmarket.com, retrieved 20 November 2011. While private sales take place all year, those sales are often not publicized as auctions are and thus do not affect the market until they become known. Art valuations made for an autumn auction may be unrealistic for the following spring auction season because fortunes in the financial markets during one season can affect the art market in the following season, and equity markets do significantly impact the art market. Volatility in the financial markets often causes volatility in the art market as happened in the contraction of the art market during the 2008-2009 recession when sales at Sotheby's, Christie's, and Phillips de Pury & Company were less than half the previous year: November 2008, $803.3 million compared to November 2007, $1.75 billion; and between 2000 and 2003 when the annual volume of art works sold at auction dropped 36%.Esterow, How to Buy in 2009 , ARTnews, March 2009. In other instances, the art market can fare reasonably well despite volatility in the stock market such as happened from January 1997 through May 2004 when the average quarterly fluctuation in the Artprice Global Index was two to three times smaller than the same statistic for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P; 500. As art market participants' fortunes wax and wane in the financial markets, buying power evolves and affects participants' ability to afford highly valued works, resulting in new buyers and sellers entering, leaving, or re-entering the market, and an artwork sold to offset losses in the financial market might be sold for substantially more or substantially less than its last at auction.Gerber, Manuel, Primary Art Market Investments - A Safe Haven when All Else Suddenly Correlates? , Prime Art Management Ltd., published in Art Fund Tracker, Nov. 2008. In the late 1980s during the stock-market boom, the art market expanded in turn with prices soaring to new heights, and investment firms took a greater interest in the art market and began to study it in- depth.Campbell, The Art of Portfolio Diversification, Maastricht University, March 2004. (art as an asset class)Goetzmann, William N., Accounting for Taste: Art and the Financial Markets Over Three Centuries, The American Economic Review, 83(5), Dec. 1993, pp. 1370-1376. Concurrently, the previously non-transparent art market became more accessible via the increasing availability of indices and online data,Campbell, R.A.J., Art as a Financial Investment, Erasmus Univ., Rotterdam, Maastricht Univ., 2007. although researchers discovered biased price estimates in the auction houses.Mei, J. and Moses, M., Vested Interest and Biased Price Estimates: Evidence from an Auction Market, The Journal of Finance, 60(5), 2005, pp. 2409-2435. Art sometimes has transient fashionability that also can affect its value: what sells well for a time may be supplanted in the market by new styles and ideas in short order. For instance, in the spring of 2008 a collector offered over $80 million for Jeff Koons' stainless-steel Rabbit, and yet a year later, of four works in the fall auctions at Christie's and Sotheby's in New York, only two of his pieces sold well and one failed to sell entirely.Inflatable investments, The volatile art of Jeff Koons, The Economist, 28 November 2009. In 2011, Christie's sold Koons' Balloon Flower sculpture for $16.9 million.Christie's, Auction result, Sale 2355 / Lot 23, christies.com, retrieved 21 November 2011. Primary and secondary markets The art market as a whole is affected by its two main parts: the primary art market, where new art comes to the market for the first time, and the secondary market, for existing art that has been sold at least once before. Once a work is sold on the primary market it enters the secondary market, and the prices for which it sold in the primary market have a direct bearing on the work's value in the secondary market. Supply and demand affect the secondary market more than the primary market because works new to the market, mainly contemporary art, have no market history for predictive analysis and thus valuation of such work is more difficult, and more speculative.Gerard and Louis, On pricing the priceless: Comments on the economics of the visual art market, European Economic Review, Elsevier, vol. 39(3-4), April 1995, pp. 509-518. (membership required). Gallery, dealer, consultant, and agent promotion as well as collectors acting as alpha consumers (trend-setters) are the forces at work in valuing primary market works. =Market entry barriers = As with blue-chip stocks, works by \\"blue-chip\\" or well-known artists are generally valued more highly than works by unknown artists since it is hard to predict how an unknown artist's work will sell, or whether it will sell at all. High barriers to entry for artistsJeffri, Joan, Philanthropy and the American artist: A historical overview, The European Journal of Cultural Policy, 3(2), 2009, pp. 207-233.Jackson, M.R., et al, Investing in Creativity: A study of the support structure for US artists, The Journal of Arts Management, Law, and Society, 2004. PDF from Urban Institute, urban.org. create scarcity in the supply and demand of the market, in turn driving up prices and raising questions of efficiency.Bonus, H., Ronte, D., Credibility and economic value in the visual arts, Journal of Cultural Economics 21, 1997 103‚Äì118.Adler, M., Stardom and Talent, in Handbook of the Economics of Art and Culture, Vol. 1, Chap. 25, 2006, pp. 895-906. While a high market entry barrier may result in having a smaller pool of artwork producers in the auction-level portion of the market, and in greater market predictability by virtue of that smaller pool and thus more reliable valuation measures, its axiomatic effect is of lesser artistic diversity negatively impacting the size of the buyer pool.Sch√∂nfeld and Reinstaller, The effects of gallery and artist reputation on prices in the primary market for art, Working Paper, Department of Economics, Vienna University of Economics & B.A., May 2005. For this reason, gallerists and art dealers consider what types of works are currently in vogue before deciding to represent a new artist and are highly selective in those choices in order to maintain a level of quality that is saleable. All these concerns are in play when gallerists set prices for emerging artists at a much lower level than for established artists. This selectivity may also be practiced on the buy side, in terms of gallerists being selective about which buyers to sell to. As another form of gatekeeping, this is done primarily to protect price points from the potential dangers of speculation, or what Velthuis calls \\"control of the biography\\" of the artwork. =Market transparency= With the 2007‚Äì2012 global financial crisis, the art market faced criticism for its lack of transparency, its Byzantine valuation methods, and a perceived lack of ethical behavior enabled by structural inadequacies in the market itself. In response, a 2009 debate occurred between valuation-setting members of the art market on the proposition that \\"the art market is less ethical than the stock market\\". At the end of the debate, the audience determined that those debating in agreement with the proposition won the debate.Saltz, Jerry, Morality Play, artnet.com, 2009-03-06, discussing the debate and its outcome. Participants included art dealers Richard Feigen and Michael Hue-Williams, collector Adam Lindemann on the \\"pro\\" side, and artist Chuck Close, critic Jerry Saltz, and auctioneer Amy Cappellazzo opposing. The debate video is available on YouTube. Of particular note in the debate was the identification of \\"chandelier bidding\\" as a practice perceived as ethically questionable. The debaters described \\"chandelier bidding\\" as bids from the chandelier, or bids from an unknown source, meaning both the bidding by the auction houses on behalf of the sellers whose items the houses are auctioning (a conflict of interest), and bidding by unidentified bidders having no intention of buying but bidding in order to drive prices up, all practiced because the auction houses keep secret from bidders a seller's reserve price. In 2011, also in response to criticism on the lack of market transparency and counterarguments that more transparency would ruin the market,Art Dealers Association of America (ADAA), Art Industry Summit , Transparency in the market: can we have more of it?, 3 March 2011. The Art Newspaper in association with the Art Dealers Association of America convened an Art Industry Summit panel discussion between major art market decision makers, where panelists discussed whether there was a need for more transparency.ADAA and The Art Newspaper, Transparency in the market...can we have more of it?, videos Part 1 , Part 2 , and Part 3 , Host Anna Somers Cocks, The Art Newpapaper, 11 March 2011. The panelists argued over whether auction houses have built-in conflicts of interest by representing sellers with secret reserves, while at the same time representing to buyers initial valuations on those works at auction time. The debate also included the issue of first and third-party guaranteed bids, and whether sellers' reserve prices should be disclosed so that participants no longer bid on an object they have no chance of buying. In response to criticisms regarding chandelier bidding and unidentified third-party guaranteed bids, Christie's International chairman Edward Dolman countered that, without a secret reserve, illegal cartels of bidders would know in advance information that could facilitate their manipulation of the market and corruption of final valuation by selling price at auction.ADAA, video 3 at 22:05 min, et seq.. With the art market's weaknesses (especially lack of transparency and conflicts of interests) becoming better known, serious external conversations about market regulation have begun among major market players; for example, the Financial Times noted that in early 2015, participants at the January World Economic Forum meeting attended a lunch seminar where the speaker warned that the global art market needs to be regulated because of systemic weaknesses which enable inside information trading, tax evasion, and money laundering.Gapper, John, Art world‚Äôs shady dealings under scrutiny at Davos, Financial Times, 22 January 2015. Accessed 17 November 2015. In terms of academic research, there is work on the opacity of price formation in finance and economics, while critical accounting work highlights the extreme difficulties in calculating the current value of an artwork using the auction sales prices of comparable artworks.  Auction house market structure  The late 1980s were a boom period for art auction houses. However, in early 1990, the market collapsed. The US overtook the EU as the world's largest art market with a global share of 47 per cent by 2001. Ranking second, the UK's world market share hovers around 25 per cent. In continental Europe, France was the market leader while in Asia, Hong Kong continues its dominance. France‚Äôs share of the art market has been progressively eroded since the 1950s, when it was the dominant location and sales at Drouot surpassed those of Sotheby‚Äôs and Christie‚Äôs combined. In 2004, the global fine art market turnover was estimated at almost billion.Art market trends 2004 , Artprice, artprice.com, 2005. Art auction sales reached a record billion in 2007, fueled by speculative bidding for artists such as Damien Hirst, Jeff Koons, and Richard Prince. The recent rise of the Chinese art market, both in terms of the size of its domestic sales and the international significance of its buyers, has, combined with a rich cultural heritage of art and antiques, produced a huge domestic market and ended the duopoly held by London and New York for over 50 years.Clare McAndrew (March 14, 2013), US retakes top spot in art sales from China The Art Newspaper. = Competitors = Christie's and Sotheby's are the leading auction venues. In 2002, LVMH acquired Swiss art advisory firm de Pury & Luxembourg and merged it with Phillips to form Phillips de Pury & Company, with the aim of breaking the duopoly at the top of the market. = Segments = Fine art auctions are generally held separately for Impressionist and Modern art as well as for Post-war and Contemporary Art. Pablo Picasso's works remain highly coveted. In 2008 Damien Hirst set a world record for auction sales by a living artist; however in 2009, Hirst‚Äôs annual auction sales had shrunk by 93%. = Estimates = \\"Estimates\\" often reflect the consignor's ambitions as much as the auction specialist's considered opinion. They do not reflect commissions. To secure consignments, auction houses concede high estimates to suit the requirements of art owners.Souren Melikian, When Auction Estimates Go Haywire, The New York Times, nytimes.com, October 7, 2011. Before an auction, interested buyers typically turn for advice to the auction house specialist who quotes the estimate and often recommends going beyond in order to secure the item.Souren Melikian, Behind stellar sales of art market, a dangerous game, The New York Times, nytimes.com, January 18, 2008. = Commissions and buyer's premium = Auction houses operate contractually on behalf of sellers of goods, charging sellers a fixed commission (fee) amounting to a percentage of the ‚Äúhammer price‚Äù for which a lot is sold. Christie's published its commissions in September 1995, with its fees ranging from 20% on the least expensive lots to 2% on lots sold for over m; Sotheby's followed suit. For Phillips de Pury & Company, final prices include commission of 25% of the first 20% of the next to million, and 12% of the rest, with estimates not reflecting commissions.Carol Vogel, Phillips Sale Totals Less Than Half the Low Estimate The New York Times, nytimes.com, November 13, 2008. Objects sold are also subject to a further fee called the \\"buyer's premium\\", 15% being typical, with the term implying that by virtue of selling an object, the auction house performs a service for the buyer subject to remuneration. Thus, both the seller and the buyer of an object or lot sold by the major auction houses pay a fee. First implemented in 1975 by Christie's, the assessment of a buyer's premium is one of several auction-house practices to which art dealers object.Orley Ashenfelter & Kathryn Graddy, Anatomy of the Rise and Fall of a Pricefixing Conspiracy: Auctions At Sotheby‚Äôs And Christie‚Äôs, Journal of Competition Law and Economics, 1(1), 3‚Äì20, March 2005, . = Performance-based fees = Beginning in 2014, Christie's charged 2 percent of the hammer price of a work that meets or exceeds its high estimate. The fee does not apply to online only sales.Melanie Gerlis (September 26, 2014), Christie's takes another 2% The Art Newspaper. = Guarantees = An auction house may offer a guaranteed selling price, or \\"guaranteed minimum\\", a practice designed to give sellers confidence to consign works and to give potential bidders reassurance that there are others willing to buy an item.Sarah Thornton, Financial machinations at auctions, The Economist, economist.com, November 18, 2011. Auction houses have offered guarantees since the early 1970s to encourage collectors to sell their artworks: The Art Newspaper reported that guarantees were first introduced in 1971 at Sotheby‚Äôs, when 47 Kandinskys and other works from the Guggenheim Museum were offered with a guaranteed minimum; similar arrangements followed in 1972 and 1973 for the Ritter and Scull collections. A guaranteed amount is generally close to the lower estimate, with the seller and the auction house sharing any amount exceeding the guaranteed minimum. In autumn 2008 when the market turned sour, Christie's and Sotheby's had to pay out at least million on works for which they guaranteed a minimum price but which failed to sell. In order to reduce their exposure to such losses, boost the market, and reduce volatility, the main auction houses now prefer that third parties take on this financial risk via \\"third-party guarantees\\" or \\"irrevocable bids\\": using this practice the auction houses sell a work to a third party for a minimum price prior to the auction and this selling price then becomes the ‚Äúreserve‚Äù below which the artwork will not be sold. If bidding for specified works stops at the minimum price, which remains undisclosed, the \\"third party\\" acquires the lot; if bidding exceeds the reserve, the third party splits any profit from its sale with the consignor and with the auction house, the percentage going to each party varying with the deal. These proportions, never disclosed to the public, are negotiated before an auction and specified in the contract signed by the auction house and the third party.Souren Melikian, Picasso Sells at Record Auction Price, The New York Times, nytimes.com, May 5, 2010. = Online sales = A Screenshot of Teo Spiller's net.art net.art.trade In May 1999, Teo Spiller sold a web art project Megatronix to Ljubljana Municipal Museum, which was by the New York Times announced as the first sell of an Internet art net.art.Mirapaul, M \\"There May Be Money in Internet Art After All\\", The New York Times, 1999-05-13 In 2003, Sotheby's abandoned its partnership with eBay after it lost millions through its various attempts to sell fine art over the internet.Just the two of us - The duopoly in fine-art auctions is weakened but very much alive The Economist, economist.com, February 27, 2003. Black market In addition to upstanding practices, a black market exists for great art, which is closely tied to art theft and art forgery. No auction houses or dealers admit openly to participating in the black market because of its illegality, but expos√©s suggest widespread problems in the field. Because demand for art objects is high, and security in many parts of the world is low, a thriving trade in illicit antiquities acquired through looting also exists. Although the art community nearly universally condemns looting because it results in destruction of archeological sites, looted art paradoxically remains omnipresent. Warfare is correlated with such looting, as is demonstrated by the recent archaeological looting in Iraq.

Built c. 1810, this two-story structure is one of the town's least-altered and best-preserved Federal style houses. It was probably built by Henry Young Brown Osgood, and remained in the Osgood family until 1940. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. It presently houses a law office. Description and history The main block of the Osgood House is a two-story wood frame structure, five bays in width and depth, with a hip roof and a granite foundation. A two-story gable-roofed ell extends to the west, ending in a small shed which replicates an earlier, similar structure. The main entrance, facing east, is flanked by sidelight windows and topped by a louvered fan. A secondary entrance is centered on the south facade, framed by pilasters and a transom window and entablature. The interior follows a fairly typical Federal period central hall plan, with turned newel post and balusters, and applied sawn ornamentation. Federal style paneling, door and window molding, and chair rails decorate the public rooms. The house was probably built by Henry Young Brown Osgood, who was named for one Fryeburg's early proprietors, although the land was bought, and may have been settled by, his father before him. The house remained in the Osgood family until 1940. Unlike other late-18th and early-19th century houses in Fryeburg, the Osgood House has not had later stylistic alterations made. It underwent a restoration around the time of its listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.

It is located within the Information and Technology Building or Newman Library and Technology Center, at 151 East 25th Street in Rose Hill, Manhattan, New York City. The building was originally known as the Lexington Building or the 25th Street Power House. It was erected in 1895 as the main powerhouse for the Lexington Avenue cable car line, and was later used as an electrical substation when the line began operating streetcars. The upper floors were used as office and manufacturing space. In the late 1980s and 1990s, the building was purchased by Baruch College as part of its new campus and renovated for library and academic use, opening in 1994. Description =Original building design= The library is housed in what was formerly the Lexington Building, with entrances from East 25th Street to the south and East 26th Street to the north in the Rose Hill section of Manhattan. The building is located in the middle of the block between Third Avenue to the east and Lexington Avenue to the west. The block directly to the south is occupied by the Newman Vertical Campus. In between both buildings is the 25th Street Pedestrian Plaza. The building was designed by architect J. William Schickel in Italian Renaissance style. It is seven-stories tall with a basement. It has a brick outer facade with granite and terra cotta trim. The internal structure consists of cast iron. The ground floor of both the 25th and 26th Street facades feature numerous arches. The basement and ground floor of the building originally supported the infrastructure for the streetcar substation. The basement contained the boiler room, featuring eight Babcock and Wilcox boiler boilers. It also featured a coal and ash conveyor system built by the C.W. Hunt Company. The engine room was located above the boilers in what is now the second floor. It featured two steam engines, a Reynolds-Corliss engine and an Allis engine. The six upper floors were designed to be leased as offices, warehouse space, and manufacturing space. In the center of the upper floors was an open courtyard, with a lightwell that extended to the top of the building. The building was constructed with large freight and passenger elevators at the 26th Street side of the building. The building also had an elevator for trucks. =Newman Library modifications= The current Baruch College Technology Building occupies of space. The main entrance to the building is from the 25th Street Plaza at the south side of the building, via two revolving doors built into archways in the building. Located on the first floor is the \\"Media Center\\", along with the Wasserman Trading Floor and Subotnick Financial Services Center of Baruch's Zicklin School of Business. The Newman Library occupies the second through fifth floor, which have a combined seating for 1,450. The second floor was formerly the engine room of the power house. The sixth floor houses a computer lab called the Baruch Computing and Technology Center. On the seventh floor is the Newman Conference Center, featuring a large 200-person conference room and four smaller conference rooms, along with a kitchen and lounge. Several offices are also located on this floor, including the financial aid and international student offices. At least one additional partial floor above the seventh floor was added as part of the renovations. The indoor courtyard and lightwell of the Lexington Building have been converted into an atrium, with the addition of a glass roof atop the lightwell to create a skylight. The atrium extends from the second floor through the center of the building. The skylight is tall and wide. At the seventh floor, several indoor trees encircle the atrium. An elevator and stairs at the main entrance lead from the ground floor to the second floor. Two additional elevator banks at the west end of the building, and a staircase adjacent to the atrium run between the second and seventh floors. =Transportation= The Newman Library is served by the M101, M102, and M103 buses, which operate northbound along Third Avenue and southbound along Lexington and Third Avenues. The M23 Select Bus Service route operates crosstown along 23rd Street, two blocks south of the building. The closest New York City Subway stations are the 23rd Street and 28th Street stations on the at Park Avenue. History The atrium within the Newman Library The Lexington Avenue surface line originally began service in April 1895 as a horsecar route. On October 13, 1895, the line began operating as a cable railway. The 25th Street Power House, also known as the Lexington Building, was constructed so it could pull the cables. One of the first tenants of the upper portion of the Lexington Building was McClure's magazine. Their offices and printing plant were located on the sixth floor of the building, occupying of space. The company became Doubleday & McClure in 1897, but continued to occupy the Lexington Building. In 1901, the Lexington Avenue Line was converted from a cable car line into an electric streetcar line. At this time, the Lexington Building was downgraded from a power house into a substation, converting alternating current into direct current. After McClure's was sold to creditors in 1911, on May 1, 1913 the sixth floor facility was taken over by The Publishers' Weekly. With the opening of subway lines in the city including the Lexington Avenue subway, streetcar lines began losing patronage. On March 25, 1936, buses replaced the Lexington Avenue streetcars, rendering the Lexington Building useless as a power station. On September 10, 1986, the nearby Baruch College announced a $252 million plan for a new campus between Lexington Avenue and 3rd Avenue, from 24th to 26th Streets. The plans were developed along with the Davis, Brody and Associates architectural firm. The new campus would include the Lexington Building (referred to as \\"Site A\\"), which had been identified as a potential state or national landmark. The school planned to renovate the building for use as a library, computer center, and for offices and student groups, at the cost of $50 million. The renovations would be made within New York State historic preservation guidelines. The plan was controversial because of the building's historical status, as well as opposition from existing tenants in the building (including a carpentry school) who would have to relocate. In addition, since the building owners opposed sale of the building, the New York State Dormitory Authority planned to acquire the building via eminent domain. The renovations by Davis, Brody and Associates were completed in 1994, costing $153.5 million. The Newman Library was dedicated on May 19, 1994.
