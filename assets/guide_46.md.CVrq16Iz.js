The Kingdom includes Denmark proper, as well as the autonomous countries of the Faroe Islands and Greenland. The Kingdom of Denmark was already consolidated in the 8th century, whose rulers are consistently referred to in Frankish sources (and in some late Frisian sources) as \\"kings\\" (). Under the rule of King Gudfred in 803 the Kingdom may have included all the major provinces of medieval Denmark. The current unified Kingdom of Denmark was founded or re-united by the Viking kings Gorm the Old and Harald Bluetooth in the 10th century. Originally an elective monarchy, it became hereditary only in the 17th century during the reign of Frederick III. A decisive transition to a constitutional monarchy occurred in 1849 with the writing of the first Constitution. The current Royal House is a branch of the princely family of Gl√ºcksburg, originally from Schleswig-Holstein in modern-day Germany, the same royal house as the Norwegian and former Greek royal families. The Danish Monarchy is constitutional and as such, the role of the monarch is defined and limited by the Constitution of Denmark. According to the constitution, the ultimate executive authority over the government of Denmark is still by and through the monarch's royal reserve powers; in practice these powers are only used according to laws enacted in Parliament or within the constraints of convention. The monarch is, in practice, limited to non-partisan functions such as bestowing honours and appointing the prime minister. The monarch and his or her immediate family undertake various official, ceremonial, diplomatic and representational duties. Queen Margrethe II ascended the throne on the death of her father, King Frederick IX, on 14 January 1972. On her accession, Queen Margrethe II became the first female monarch of Denmark since Margrethe I, ruler of the Scandinavian countries in 1375‚Äí1412, during the Kalmar Union. Danish regnal names have traditionally (since 1513) alternated between \\"Frederick\\" (Frederik) and \\"Christian\\"; Margrethe has taken the place of a Christian, and accordingly her heir apparent is Crown Prince Frederik. HistoryEarly kingdom= One of the two Jelling stones, attesting to Harald Bluetooth's unification and Christianization of Denmark. The Danish monarchy is over 1200 years old, founded in the 8th century (or earlier). The line of kings of the modern kingdom of Denmark can be traced back to Harthacnut father of Gorm the Old (, ), who reigned in the early 10th century. The kingdom itself though is probably a couple of hundred years older than that. The Danes were united (or more likely reunited) and officially Christianized in 965 CE by Harald Bluetooth, the story of which is recorded on the Jelling stones. The exact extent of Harald's kingdom is unknown, although it is reasonable to believe that it stretched from the defensive line of Dannevirke, including the Viking city of Hedeby, across Jutland, the Danish isles and into southern present day Sweden; Scania and perhaps Halland. Furthermore, the Jelling stones attests that Harald had also \\"won\\" Norway. The son of Harald, Sweyn Forkbeard, mounted a series of wars of conquest against England, which was completed by Sweyn's son Cnut the Great by the middle of the eleventh century. The reign of Cnut represented the peak of the Danish Viking age; his North Sea Empire included England (1016), Denmark (1018), Norway (1028) and held strong influence over the north-eastern coast of Germany. The last monarch descended from Valdemar IV, Christopher III of Denmark, died in 1448. Count Christian of Oldenburg, descendant of Sophia, the daughter of Valdemar IV's aunt Richeza of Denmark, Lady of Werle, who was the daughter of Eric V of Denmark, was chosen as his successor and became the next monarch of Denmark, ruling under the name Christian I. Richeza thus was the female founder of the House of Oldenburg. =Absolutism= Memorial inside Christiansborg Palace. Depicted is Frederick III and the event commemorated is the failed Swedish attack on Copenhagen in 1659. Originally the Danish monarchy was elective, but in practice the eldest son of the reigning monarch was elected. Later a Coronation Charter was signed by the king to restrict the powers of the Danish monarch. In 1657, during the Second Northern War, King Frederick III launched a war of revenge against Sweden which turned into a complete disaster. The war became a disaster for two reasons: Primarily, because Denmark's new powerful ally, the Netherlands, remained neutral as Denmark was the aggressor and Sweden the defender. Secondly, the Belts froze over in a rare occurrence during the winter of 1657-1658, allowing King Charles X Gustav of Sweden to lead his armies across the ice to invade Zealand. In the following Treaty of Roskilde, Denmark‚ÄìNorway capitulated and gave up all of Eastern Denmark (i.e. Sk√•ne, Halland, Blekinge and Bornholm), in addition to the counties of Bohusl√§n and Tr√∏ndelag in Norway. But the Second Northern War was not yet over. Three months after the peace treaty was signed, Charles X Gustav held a council of war where he decided to simply wipe Denmark from the map and unite all of Scandinavia under his rule. Once again the Swedish army arrived outside Copenhagen. However, this time the Danes did not panic or surrender. Instead, they decided to fight and prepared to defend Copenhagen. Frederick III had stayed in his capital and now encouraged the citizens of Copenhagen to resist the Swedes, by saying he would \\"die in his nest\\", rather than to evacuate to safety in Norway. Furthermore, this unprovoked declaration of war by Sweden finally triggered the alliance that Denmark‚ÄìNorway had with the Netherlands, and a powerful Dutch fleet was sent to Copenhagen with vital supplies and reinforcements, which saved the city from being captured during the Swedish attack. Charles X Gustav suddenly died of an illness in early 1660, while planning an invasion of Norway. Following his death, Sweden made peace in the Treaty of Copenhagen. The Swedes returned Tr√∏ndelag to Norway and Bornholm to Denmark, but kept the other territories gained two years earlier. The Netherlands and other European powers accepted the settlement, not wanting both coasts of the √òresund strait controlled by Denmark. This treaty established the boundaries between Norway, Denmark, and Sweden that still exist today. Absolutism was introduced in 1660-1661 and the elective monarchy was de jure transformed into an hereditary monarchy. Male primogeniture succession was laid down in law in the Royal Decree of 1665. =Constitutional period= German occupation of World War II, King Christian X became a powerful symbol of national identity. This image dates from the King's birthday, 26 September 1940. When he succeeded to the throne in January 1848, King Frederick VII was almost at once met by the demands for a constitution and an end to absolutism. The Schleswig-Holsteiners wanted an independent state while the Danes wished to maintain South Jutland as a Danish area. Frederick VII soon yielded to the Danish demands, and in March he accepted the end of absolutism, which resulted in the June Constitution of 1849. During the First War of Schleswig against the German powers in 1848‚Äì51, Frederick appeared as ‚Äùthe national leader‚Äù and was regarded almost as a war hero, despite having never taken any active part in the struggles. On 5 June 1849 the constitution, known as the June Constitution, was altered to create the framework of a constitutional monarchy for Denmark. As King Frederick VII was without legitimate issue, Prince Christian of Gl√ºcksborg was chosen in 1853 as heir presumptive to the Danish throne, with the approval of the great powers of Europe, in light of the expected extinction of the senior line of the House of Oldenburg. A justification for this choice was his marriage to Louise of Hesse-Kassel, who as a niece of Christian VIII, was a more close relative to the incumbent king than her husband. Upon the death of King Frederick VII of Denmark in 1863, Christian IX acceded to the throne as the first Danish monarch of the House of Gl√ºcksburg. Christian IX eventually became known as Father-in-law of Europe due to his family ties with most other ruling dynasties of Europe: His daughter Princess Alexandra married Edward VII of the United Kingdom, another daughter Princess Dagmar married Alexander III of Russia and Princess Thyra married Crown Prince Ernst August of Hanover. His son Vilhelm went on to become George I of Greece. Further, his grandson Carl became Haakon VII of Norway. To this day the Danish Royal Family are related to most other reigning European dynasties. The Easter Crisis of 1920 was a constitutional crisis which began with the dismissal of the elected government by King Christian X, a reserve power which was granted to him by the Danish constitution. The immediate cause was a conflict between the king and the cabinet over the reunification with Denmark of Schleswig, a former Danish fiefdom which had been lost to Prussia during the Second War of Schleswig. According to the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, the disposition of Schleswig was to be determined by two Schleswig Plebiscites: one in Northern Schleswig (today Denmark's South Jutland County), the other in Central Schleswig (today part of the German state of Schleswig-Holstein). Many Danish nationalists felt that Central Schleswig should be returned to Denmark regardless of the plebiscite's results, generally motivated by a desire to see Germany permanently weakened in the future. Christian X agreed with these sentiments, and ordered Prime Minister Carl Theodor Zahle to include Central Schleswig in the re-unification process. As Denmark had been operating as a parliamentary democracy since the Cabinet of Deuntzer in 1901, Zahle felt he was under no obligation to comply. He refused the order and resigned several days later after a heated exchange with the king. Subsequently, Christian X dismissed the rest of the government and replaced it with a de facto conservative care-taker cabinet under Otto Liebe. The dismissal caused demonstrations and an almost revolutionary atmosphere in Denmark, and for several days the future of the monarchy seemed very much in doubt. In light of this, negotiations were opened between the king and members of the Social Democrats. Faced with the potential overthrow of the Danish monarchy, Christian X backed down and dismissed his own government. This was the most recent time that a sitting Danish monarch made an executive decision without the support of a cabinet accountable to the legislature; following the crisis, Christian X accepted his drastically reduced role as symbolic head of state. The Act of Succession of 27 March 1953 was promulgated after a 1953 referendum introduced the possibility of female succession and, in effect, made the current queen regnant, Margrethe II, the heir presumptive and eventual successor to her father, Frederick IX upon his death in 1972, rather than her uncle Prince Knud. Following a referendum in 2009, the Act of Succession was amended so that primogeniture no longer puts males over females. In other words, the first-born child would become heir to the throne regardless of gender. Constitutional and official role The Throne Room at Christiansborg Palace is where foreign ambassadors present their credentials to the Queen. According to the Danish Constitution, the Danish Monarch, as the de facto head of state, is the holder of executive and, jointly with the Folketing, legislative power.Constitutional Act of Denmark The Monarch has the ability to deny giving a bill royal assent as well as to choose and dismiss the Prime Minister or any Minister of Government with or without cause; however, no Monarch has exercised the latter powers since King Christian X dismissed the government on 28 March 1920, sparking the 1920 Easter Crisis. However, when reading the Danish Constitution of 1953, it is important to bear in mind that the usage of the word king, in the context of exercising acts of state, is understood by Danish jurists to be read as the Government (consisting of the Prime Minister and other ministers). This is a logical consequence of articles 12, 13 and 14, all of which in essence stipulate that the powers vested in the monarch can only be exercised through ministers, who are responsible for all acts, thus removing any political or legal liability from the Monarch. Today the Queen delegates much royal authority to Ministers in government, allowing the Queen to engage in the ceremonial role outlined by the Danish constitution. The Prime Minister and Cabinet attend the regular meetings of the Council of State, at which the Monarch presides and gives royal assent to laws. The Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs report regularly to the Queen to advise her of the latest political developments. The Queen hosts official visits by foreign Heads of State, pays state visits abroad, receives letters of credence from foreign ambassadors and signs those of Danish ambassadors. The convention for appointment of a new prime minister after a general election is that after consultation with representatives of the political parties, the Queen invites the party leader who has the support of the largest number of seats in the Folketing to form a government. Once it has been formed, the Queen formally appoints it. =Greenland and the Faroe Islands= Greenland and the Faroe Islands are part of the Kingdom of Denmark and thus their head of state is also the monarch of Denmark, in accordance with the Danish Constitution.Facts about Greenland After a referendum in Greenland in 2009, the Danish Parliament implemented a new Danish Law called Act on Greenlandic Self-rule, which, unlike any other case with the Indigenous Peoples around the world, acknowledges Greenlanders as a people in accordance to the International Law, and hereby giving the Greenlanders ability to obtain sovereignty. Succession Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark Denmark has had absolute primogeniture since 2009. The Danish Act of Succession adopted on 27 March 1953 restricts the throne to those descended from King Christian X and his wife, Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, through approved marriages. Dynasts lose their right to the throne if they marry without the permission of the monarch given in the Council of State. Individuals born to unmarried dynasts or to former dynasts that married without royal permission, and their descendants, are excluded from the throne. Further, when approving a marriage, the monarch can impose conditions that must be met in order for any resulting offspring to have succession rights. Part II, Section 9 of the Danish Constitution of 5 June 1953 provides that the parliament will elect a king and determine a new line of succession should a situation arise where there are no eligible descendants of King Christian X and Queen Alexandrine. The monarch of Denmark must be a member of the Danish National Church, or Evangelical Lutheran Church of Denmark (Danish Constitution, II,6). The National Church is by law the State Church, though the monarch is not its head. =Background= The first law governing the succession to the Danish throne as a hereditary monarchy was the Kongeloven (), enacted 14 November 1665, and published in 1709. It declared that the crown of Denmark shall descend by heredity to the legitimate descendants of King Frederick III, and that the order of succession shall follow semi-Salic primogeniture, according to which the crown is inherited by an heir, with preference among the Monarch's children to males over females; among siblings to the elder over the younger; and among Frederick III's remoter descendants by substitution, senior branches over junior branches. Female descendants were eligible to inherit the throne in the event there were no eligible surviving male dynasts born in the male line. As for the duchies, Holstein and Lauenburg where the King ruled as duke, these lands adhered to Salic law (meaning that only males could inherit the ducal throne), and by mutual agreement were permanently conjoined. The duchies of Schleswig (a Danish fief), Holstein and Lauenburg (German fiefs) were joined in personal union with the Crown of Denmark. This difference caused problems when Frederick VII of Denmark proved childless, making a change in dynasty imminent, and causing the lines of succession for the duchies on one hand and for Denmark on the other to diverge. That meant that the new King of Denmark would not also be the new Duke of Schleswig or Duke of Holstein. To ensure the continued adhesion of the Elbe duchies to the Danish Crown, the line of succession to the duchies was modified in the London Protocol of 1852, which designated Prince Christian IX of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl√ºcksburg, as the new heir apparent, although he was, strictly, the heir neither to the Crown of Denmark nor to the Duchies of Schleswig, Holstein or Lauenburg by primogeniture. Originally, the Danish prime minister Christian Albrecht Bluhme wanted to keep the separate hereditary principles, but in the end the government decided on a uniform agnatic primogeniture, which was accepted by the Parliament. This order of succession remained in effect for a hundred years, then the Salic law was changed to male-preference primogeniture in 1953, meaning that females could inherit, but only if they had no brothers. In 2009, the mode of inheritance of the throne was once more changed, this time into an absolute primogeniture. =Privileges and restrictions= Royal Standard of Denmark. Following the transformation of Denmark's monarchy from elective (at least theoretically, although it had generally descended to the eldest son of the House of Oldenburg since 1448) to hereditary in 1660, the so-called Kongelov () established the right to rule \\"by the grace of God\\" for King Frederick III and his posterity. Out of the articles in this law, all except for Article 21 and Article 25 have since been repealed. Article 21 states \\"No Prince of the Blood, who resides here in the Realm and in Our territory, shall marry, or leave the Country, or take service under foreign Masters, unless he receives Permission from the King\\". Under this provision, princes of Denmark who permanently reside in other realms by express permission of the Danish Crown (i.e. members of the dynasties of Greece, Norway and the United Kingdom) do not thereby forfeit their royalty in Denmark, nor are they bound to obtain prior permission to travel abroad or to marry from its sovereign, although since 1950 those not descended in male-line from King Christian IX are no longer in the line of succession to the Danish throne. However, those who do reside in Denmark or its territories continue to require the monarch's prior permission to travel abroad and to marry. Article 25 of the Kongelov stipulates, with respect to members of the Royal dynasty: \\"They should answer to no Magistrate Judges, but their first and last Judge shall be the King, or to whomsoever He decrees.\\" Although all other articles of the Kongelov have been repealed by amendments to the Constitution in 1849, 1853 and 1953, these two articles have thus far been left intact. Residences The royal palaces of Denmark became property of the state with the introduction of the constitutional monarchy in 1849. Since then, a varying number of these have been put at the disposal of the monarchy. The agreement on which is renewed at the accession of every new monarch. =Current residences=Amalienborg Palace Amalienborg Palace, the monarch's principal residence. The monarch has the use of the four palaces at Amalienborg in Copenhagen as a residence and work palace. Currently, the Queen herself resides in Christian IX's Palace and the Crown Prince in Frederik VIII's Palace. Christian VIII's Palace has apartments for other members of the royal family, whereas Christian VII's Palace is used for official events and to accommodate guests. Amalienborg was originally built in the 1750s by architect Nicolai Eigtved for four noble families; however, when Christiansborg Palace burned in 1794, the royal family bought the palaces and moved in. The state rooms of Christian VIII's Palace and Christian VII's Palace may be visited by the public on guided tours. Christiansborg Palace Christiansborg Palace, site of many official functions of the monarch.In addition, parts of Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen is also at the disposal of the monarch. It is the site of official functions such as banquets, state dinners, diplomatic accreditations, public audiences, meetings of the Council of State, receptions, royal christenings, lyings-in-state and other ceremonies. Also, the Royal Stables which provide the ceremonial transport by horse-drawn carriage for the royal family, is located here. The present building, the third with this name, is the last in a series of successive castles and palaces constructed on the same site since the erection of the first castle in 1167. The palace today bears witness to three eras of architecture, as the result of two serious fires in 1794 and in 1884. The main part of the current palace, finished in 1928, is in the historicist Neo- Baroque style. The chapel dates to 1826 and is in a Neoclassical style. The showgrounds were built 1738-46, in a Baroque style. The royal parts of the palace are open to the public when not in use. Fredensborg Palace Fredensborg Palace, Spring and Autumn residence of the monarch. Another residence is Fredensborg Palace north of Copenhagen which is used principally in Spring and Autumn. It is often the site of state visits and ceremonial events in the royal family. The palace may be visited by the public on guided tours when not in use. Graasten Palace In Jutland, Graasten Palace is at the disposal of the monarch. It was used as the summer residence of King Frederick IX and Queen Ingrid. Since the death of Queen Ingrid in 2000, the Queen has stayed at Graasten for a yearly vacation in summer. Hermitage Hunting Lodge The hunting lodge the Eremitage Palace in the Dyrehaven deer park north of Copenhagen is used during royal hunts in Dyrehaven. Sorgenfri Palace Finally, Sorgenfri Palace is at the disposal of the monarch. It was the residence of Hereditary Prince Knud and Hereditary Princess Caroline Mathilde and is not in official use at all at this time. Marselisborg Palace Apart from these state-owned palaces, Marselisborg Palace in Aarhus is privately owned by the Queen. It functions as the summer residence of the Queen, as well as during the Easter and Christmas holidays. Royal Family In the Kingdom of Denmark all members of the ruling dynasty that hold the title Prince or Princess of Denmark are said to be members of the Danish Royal Family. As with other European monarchies, distinguishing who is a member of the national Royal Family is difficult due to lack of strict legal or formal definition of who is or is not a member. The Queen and her siblings belong to the House of Gl√ºcksburg, a branch of the House of Oldenburg. The Queen's children and male-line descendants belong agnatically to the family de Laborde de Monpezat. =Main members= Royal Family of Denmark during Queen Margrethe II's 70th birthday, 16 April 2010. The Danish Royal Family includes: * The Queen ** The Crown Prince (Prince Frederik, The Queen's elder son) ** The Crown Princess (Princess Mary, The Crown Prince's wife) *** Prince Christian (The Crown Prince's elder son) *** Princess Isabella (The Crown Prince's elder daughter) *** Prince Vincent (The Crown Prince's younger son) *** Princess Josephine (The Crown Prince's younger daughter) ** Prince Joachim (The Queen's younger son) ** Princess Marie (Prince Joachim's second wife) *** Prince Nikolai (Prince Joachim's eldest son) *** Prince Felix (Prince Joachim's second son) *** Prince Henrik (Prince Joachim's youngest son) *** Princess Athena (Prince Joachim's daughter) * The Princess of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg (Princess Benedikte, The Queen's sister) * The Queen of the Hellenes (Queen Anne-Marie, The Queen's sister) =Extended members= The extended Danish Royal Family which includes people who do not hold the title of Prince or Princess of Denmark but have close connections to the Queen could be said to include: * The Prince of Sayn- Wittgenstein-Berleburg (Prince Gustav, Princess Benedikte's son) * Princess Alexandra of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg (Princess Benedikte's eldest daughter) * Count Jefferson von Pfeil und Klein-Ellguth (Princess Alexandra's husband) ** Count Richard von Pfeil und Klein-Ellguth (Princess Alexandra's son) ** Countess Ingrid von Pfeil und Klein-Ellguth (Princess Alexandra's daughter) * Princess Nathalie of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg (Princess Benedikte's youngest daughter) *Alexander Johannsmann (Princess Nathalie's husband) **Konstantin Johannsmann (Princess Nathalie's son) **Louisa Johannsmann (Princess Nathalie's daughter) * Count Ingolf of Rosenborg (cousin of the Queen) * Countess Sussie of Rosenborg (Count Ingolf's wife) * Alexandra, Countess of Frederiksborg (former daughter-in-law to the Queen, mother of Prince Nikolai & Prince Felix) =Greek Royal Family= Most members of the Greek Royal Family are members of the Danish Royal Family and bear the title of Prince or Princess of Greece and Denmark, as descendants of Christian IX of Denmark. Due to the morganatic status of her marriage, Marina, Consort of Prince Michael, and their children, Princesses Alexandra and Olga, are exceptions. Style The Danish Crown Regalia, all of which are on public display at Rosenborg Castle in Copenhagen: 1. Crown of Christian IV (1595); 2\\\\. Crown of Christian V (1665‚Äì70); 3. The Queen consort crown (1731); 4. Sceptre; 5. Sword of state; and, 6. Globus cruciger. The monarchs of Denmark have a long history of royal and noble titles. Historically Danish monarchs also used the titles 'King of the Wends' and 'King of the Goths'. Upon her accession to the throne in 1972 Queen Margrethe II abandoned all titles except the title 'Queen of Denmark'. The kings and queens of Denmark are addressed as 'Your Majesty', whereas princes and princesses are referred to as His or Her Royal Highness (Hans or Hendes Kongelige H√∏jhed), or His or Her Highness (Hans or Hendes H√∏jhed). * Eric of Pomerania: By the Grace of God, King of Denmark, Sweden and Norway, the Wends and the Goths, Duke of Pomerania. * Christopher of Bavaria: By the Grace of God, King of Denmark, Sweden and Norway, the Wends and the Goths, Count Palatine of the Rhine, Duke of Bavaria. * The full title of the Danish sovereigns from Christian I to Christian II was: By the Grace of God, King of Denmark, Sweden and Norway, the Wends and the Goths, Duke of Schleswig, Holstein, Stormarn and Dithmarschen, Count of Oldenburg and Delmenhorst. * Frederick I of Denmark: By the Grace of God, King of Denmark, the Wends and the Goths, Duke of Schleswig, Holstein, Stormarn and Dithmarschen, Count of Oldenburg and Delmenhorst, elected King of Norway..1 ‚Äì utdypning (Store norske leksikon) * The full title of the Danish sovereigns from Christian III to Christian VII was: By the Grace of God, King of Denmark and Norway, the Wends and the Goths, Duke of Schleswig, Holstein, Stormarn and Dithmarschen, Count of Oldenburg and Delmenhorst. * Oldenburg was elevated to a duchy during the reign of Christian VII, and the style was changed accordingly: By the Grace of God, King of Denmark and Norway, the Wends and the Goths, Duke of Schleswig, Holstein, Stormarn, Dithmarschen and Oldenburg. This style was used until his son, Frederick VI, lost control of the Kingdom of Norway by the 1814 Treaty of Kiel. * Frederick VI gained control over R√ºgen 1814-1815 leading to the style: By the Grace of God, King of Denmark, the Wends and the Goths, Prince of R√ºgen, Duke of Schleswig, Holstein, Stormarn, Dithmarschen and Oldenburg. * In 1815, Frederick VI relinquished R√ºgen in favour of the Prussian king, and instead gained the Duchy of Lauenburg from the British-Hanoveran king leading to the style: By the Grace of God, King of Denmark, the Wends and the Goths, Duke of Schleswig, Holstein, Stormarn, Dithmarschen, Lauenburg and Oldenburg. This style was used until 1918 when Iceland was elevated to an independent state in union with Denmark. * The full title of Christian X from 1918 to 1944: By the Grace of God, King of Denmark, Iceland, the Wends and the Goths, Duke of Schleswig, Holstein, Stormarn, Dithmarschen, Lauenburg and Oldenburg. * The full title of Christian X following the 1944 dissolution of the Dano-Icelandic union: By the Grace of God, King of Denmark, the Wends and the Goths, Duke of Schleswig, Holstein, Stormarn, Dithmarschen, Lauenburg and Oldenburg. The same style was used by his son, Frederick IX, until his death in 1972 * When ascending the throne in 1972, Margrethe II abandoned all the monarch's traditional titles except the title to Denmark, hence her style By the Grace of God, Queen of Denmark.

The firm which was founded by David Morgenthaler in 1968, is based in Cleveland with offices in Menlo Park, California, Boston, and Boulder, Colorado. History David Morgenthaler founded the firm in 1968 after a career as an operating executive. From 1957 until 1968, Morgenthaler was CEO of Foseco, Inc., a manufacturer of specialty chemicals owned by early venture capital firm J.H. Whitney & Co. After selling his venture-backed business to an international company, Morgenthaler decided to pursue venture capital investing on his own. Morgenthaler shifted from a family partnership and began raising institutional funds in the early 1980s. Since its inception, Morgenthaler has worked with entrepreneurs in approximately 300 companies. =David Morgenthaler= In addition to his role in building a nationally focused venture capital firm, Morgenthaler also took a leadership role in establishing the legitimacy and potential of the nascent venture capital industry. He served from 1977 to 1979 as the President and then Chairman of the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA). During Morgenthaler's tenure at NVCA, he was called to testify before Congress in support of the capital gains tax reduction enacted in 1978. He was also involved in changing the ERISA legislation in 1979, allowing for pension funds to invest in private equity for the first time. (See also: Early history of private equity: Regulatory and tax changes) Morgenthaler was awarded the first National Venture Capital Lifetime Achievement Award in 1998 for his role in the emergence of the venture capital industry. Morgenthaler was inducted into the Private Equity Analyst's Venture Capital Hall of Fame. Earlier in his career, Morgenthaler was a member of the management team of several young growth companies. He received both a BS and a MS degree in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1941. Morgenthaler died in June 2016, at the age of 96. He worked up until the very end, with his son noting that he was testing an app from his hospital bed. \\"At age 96, almost 97, who does that?\\" his son said.

DeLancey was known as a High Churchman, and served as the first bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Western New York. Family and education DeLancey was born at Mamaroneck, New York into a celebrated New York family descended from Caleb Heathcote. He was the son of John Peter DeLancey, a Revolutionary War soldier, and his wife, Elizabeth Floyd. His sister married James Fenimore Cooper. DeLancey graduated from Yale College in 1817 and later studied divinity with Bishop John Henry Hobart of New York. He served in several positions in New York before being ordained to the ministry in 1822. He married Frances Munro, daughter of Peter Munro, in 1820. They had five sons and three daughters. Their eldest son, Edward Floyd DeLancey, was president of the New York Genealogical and Biographical Society. Ministry After his ordination, DeLancey took a position in Philadelphia as general assistant to William White (Bishop of Pennsylvania). He held various clerical offices in Philadelphia and, in 1826, was elected a Trustee of the University of Pennsylvania. Delancey was elected provost of the University in 1828, continuing in that office until 1834. The next three years showed a distinct improvement in the number of students and in other areas. On November 2, 1838 DeLancey was elected first Bishop of the newly created Episcopal Diocese of Western New York. He was the 34th bishop of the ECUSA, and was consecrated by bishops Alexander Viets Griswold, Henry Ustick Onderdonk, and Benjamin Treadwell Onderdonk. DeLancey remained in that position for more than 25 years, residing in the town of Geneva. In 1852, he attended the fifteenth anniversary of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts as one of the two representatives of the American House of Bishops, being the first American Bishop to be recognized officially as one of their own body by the Anglican Bishops. DeLancey was active in matters of church organization and legislation, and was instrumental in placing Hobart College and several other educational institutions on a firm basis. He was also involved in the establishment of St. Peter's Episcopal Church (Geneva, New York), which was later dedicated as the DeLancey Memorial Church. He received the following honorary degrees: Doctor of Divinity from Yale in 1827, Doctor of Laws from Union College in 1849 and Doctor of Civil Laws from Oxford University, in 1852. He died in Geneva, New York on April 5, 1865, where his remains were interred in St. Peter's Episcopal Church.

Thomas Leavitt (1616‚Äì1696) was an English Puritan who was one of the earliest permanent settlers of the Province of New Hampshire. A farmer, Leavitt apparently followed Rev. John Wheelwright to his settlement of Exeter, New Hampshire. Later Leavitt moved on to Hampton. He was seldom involved in town business, and was described by one writer as \\"a quiet, useful citizen.\\"Thomas Levet of Exeter and Hampton, Victor Channing Sanborn, The New England Historical and Genealogical Register, Vol. LXVII, The New England Historic Genealogical Society, Published by the Society, Boston, 1913 He was not remarkable, except insofar as those who crossed the Atlantic, swept by storms startling to Englishmen, to settle an unknown continent, peopled by tribes with which they were unfamiliar, were unremarkable. Life in the new world Thomas Leavitt arrived in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1635,One of the most bizarre sidelights of early New Hampshire history was the early deed, signed in 1629, between the Native American chiefs in the locality of Exeter, New Hampshire, and John Wheelwright, Augustine Storer, William Wentworth, 'Thomas Levet,' and Thomas Wight. In the document, which was said to have been discovered years later in the files of York County, Maine, Wheelwright, Levet and the other early Exeter settlers were said to have bought their title from the Indians. The entire document was later adjusted to be a clever forgery. Thomas Leavitt almost certainly had no knowledge of it. and an early Boston record of 1636 shows him assessed a fine.Records Relating to the Early History of Boston, Second Report of the Record Commissioners of the City of Boston, Rockwell and Churchill, City Printers, Boston, Mass., 1881 Perhaps chafing at the discipline of early Puritan Boston, Leavitt departed in 1639 for Exeter, New Hampshire, where the Rev. John Wheelwright, a Puritan clergyman forced to flee England because of fears of persecution - and later forced to leave Massachusetts because of run-ins with ecclesiastical authorities - had settled and assembled a congregation.Early Settlers in Exeter, New Hampshire, The New England Historical and Genealogical Register, Vol. XXV, The New England Historic Genealogical Society, 1871, Reissued by Heritage Books Leavitt remained in Exeter only a few years before eventually settling at nearby Hampton, one of the four original New Hampshire townships chartered by the General Court of Massachusetts.The town of Leavittstown, New Hampshire, was later settled by descendants of Thomas Leavitt of Hampton. Leavittstown was subsequently rechristened Effingham, in honor of an absentee English lord. Thomas Leavitt was a farmer and perhaps a tanner, although one ancient deed called him 'planter.' In 1639, Leavitt was a signer of the Exeter Combination,The History of New Hampshire, Vol. I, Jeremy Belknap, John Farmer, S. C. Stevens and Ela and Wadleigh, Dover, 1831 but soon left Exeter for Hampton, where by 1644 he had married Isabella (Bland) Asten, daughter of John Bland (alias Smith) and Isabella Drake of Colchester, Essex, England - and later of Watertown, Massachusetts, and Martha's Vineyard - and widow of Francis Asten, who had died in the New World a couple of years prior. Leavitt and his new wife lived on the land granted to Asten in Hampton. Nothing is known of Leavitt's parentage or even place of birth in England, although some historians Thomas Leavitt and his Artist Friend James Akin, The Granite Monthly: A New Hampshire Magazine, Vol. XXV, Published by the Granite Monthly Company, Concord, N.H., 1898 speculate that Leavitt came from heavily Puritan Lincolnshire. His name appears in various permutations in early records, mostly as Levet, but also as Levit, Levitt and Levett - sometimes all in the same document.The corruption in the spelling of the name has flummoxed observers for centuries. In 1817, for instance, Rev. Dr. William Bentley, pastor of Salem's East Church, paid a visit to Beverly, Massachusetts, to attempt to sort out one Leavitt from another. His visit, like many before and since, was inconclusive. The manner of spelling was complicated by the fact that Leavitt apparently was not literate, and simply made his mark in early documents. When his name was written for him by someone else, as it was in his will and that of his wife, the orthography almost always appeared as Levet. But a copy of the Hampton Petition of 1643, filed in the Massachusetts Archives with the early settler's name appended to the list of signatories, records his name as \\"Livet\\".Thomas Levet of Exeter and Hampton, Victor Channing Sanborn, The New England Historical and Genealogical Register, Vol. LXVII, The New England Historic Genealogical Society, Published by the Society, Boston, 1913 Leavitt served as selectman for Hampton in 1657 and again a decade later, in 1667. In 1664 he served a year's term as constable. His name appeared on the list of several juries, and in 1678 he took the oath of allegiance to Massachusetts. By 1683 he, along with 18 other citizens, signed a petition asking that their poll taxes be cut as the signers were aged, \\"many about seventy, some above eighty, others near ninety, being past labour and work.\\" By 1691 Leavitt and his wife had delegated their power of attorney to son John to deal with his mother Isabel's share of the Bland family lands on Martha's Vineyard. Thomas Leavitt died at Hampton, New Hampshire, on November 28, 1696, while still residing on the land granted to his wife's first husband. His widow died three years later, in 1699. The couple had four sons,Genealogical and Family History of the State of New Hampshire, Vol. IV, Ezra S. Stearns, William F. Whitcher, Edward E. Parker, The Lewis Publishing Company, New York, 1908 all of whom lived nearby and who left descendants who still reside in the area today.History of the Town of Hampton, New Hampshire, From Its First Settlement in 1638, to the Autumn of 1892, Vol. II, Joseph Dow, Lucy Ellen Dow, Salem Press Publishing and Printing Co., Salem, Mass., 1893 In his will Leavitt had made provisions for his wife, leaving her land and \\"two cows, two swine, three sheep, my brass and puter [pewter], the thirds of all my corne.\\"The Will of Thomas Leavitt of Hampton, 1692, Lane Memorial Library, Hampton, New Hampshire Leavitt also carefully disposed of his tools, leaving his son Aretas \\"half the cross cut saw,\\" with son John receiving \\"the other half the tools mentioned with all carpenter tools and his house and ground.\\"The matter of dividing a cross-cut saw by half to satisfy the provisions of a will seems a treacherous endeavor. The will makes note of of land, including of swampland, owned by Leavitt which he left to his wife and children.Hampton's location near the salt marshes made it sought after by early settlers, who exploited the salt reserves for commercial purposes.

In 1978, he was appointed Executive Assistant to the Under Secretary of State for External Affairs, Allan Gotlieb. Starting in May 1980, he worked as Assistant Secretary to the Cabinet (Foreign and Defence Policy) in the Privy Council Office, a position from which he advised Prime Ministers Trudeau, Turner and Mulroney on foreign policy, defence, and development issues. In 1986, Fowler was appointed Assistant Deputy Minister for Policy in the Department of National Defence, and then as Deputy Minister of National Defence in May 1989. In January 1995, Fowler was appointed Canada's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, a position he retained until August 2000, making him Canada's longest-serving Ambassador and Permanent Representative. While at the UN, he represented Canada on the Security Council in 1999 and 2000 and issued two ground-breaking reports on sanctions-busting in Angola, which cut off UNITA's access to the arms bazaar and led to the end of the civil war which had ravaged Angola for 25 years. He was also Ambassador to Italy and the three Rome-based UN food agencies; Sherpa for the Kananaskis G8 Summit (for which he chaired the creation of the Africa Action Plan, a response to the New Partnership for Africa‚Äôs Development); and the personal representative for Africa of Prime Ministers Chr√©tien, Martin and Harper. Robert Fowler retired from the federal public service in the fall of 2006, and is now a Senior Fellow at the University of Ottawa's Graduate School of Public and International Affairs and sits on the Advisory Council of Canadian Defence and Foreign Affairs Institute. Fowler is also a member of the Research Steering Committee for the Will to Intervene (W2I) Project.Members of the Research Steering Committee for the Will to Intervene As ambassador and foreign policy adviser, he encouraged sophisticated sanctions regimes to discipline the global diamond markets. In 2000, he was responsible for producing the \\"Fowler Report\\", which led ultimately to the establishment of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme. He was also instrumental in bringing the 25-year-old war in Angola to an end. In a March 2010 meeting of the Liberal Party, Fowler was a guest speaker who took the opportunity to condemn the Liberals, saying, \\"I believe the Liberal party has, to a significant extent, lost its way, at least in policy terms, and of course I mean, in particular, my area of foreign policy terms, and is in danger of losing its soul...To this observer, it seems that Liberals today don't stand for much in the way of principles...I have the impression that they will endorse anything and everything which might return them to power and nothing which won't, whatever the merits of either. It's all about getting to power, and it shows...I believe Liberals seem prepared to embrace an infinite array of special interests in order to shill for votes rather than forging a broad- based principled alliance founded in deep Liberal traditions, one with a distinct social contract and an independent Canadian character, which would protect, project and defend core Liberal values at home and abroad...\\" and on the Conservatives, he said, \\"In a short period of time we've established unique credentials in Africa\\", Fowler said. \\"I fear, however, that we are in the process of squandering a hard-won and important asset.\\". Fowler did briefly praise the Harper government, \\"I owe a debt to Mr. Harper and I am all too aware that such criticism is a rather churlish way of repaying it....(however) after four consecutive Conservative budgets, it is clear that the current government has failed to live up to its 2006 election promise to move Canadian aid performance toward the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development) average donor spending levels.\\" Fowler stated that both major parties have been enticed by the allure of political gains within the Jewish community. He said it is a strategy that leads to an unproductive support for Israel and undermines Canada's reputation as a trusted mediator in the Middle East. \\"The scramble to lock up the Jewish vote in Canada meant selling out our widely admired and long-established reputation for fairness and justice\\", Fowler said. During an acceptance speech for an honorary doctorate, on 31 October 2010, from the University of Ottawa, Fowler called out young Canadians for being apathetic and stating that they lose their \\"bitching rights\\" and \\"Your age group's involvement in the political process, at all levels of government, stretches any reasonable definition of apathy.\\".  Disappearance  On 21 July 2008, the Secretary General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, appointed Fowler to be his Special Envoy to Niger, with the rank of Under-Secretary-General in the Secretariat of the UN. While acquitting his UN mission, Fowler and his colleague Louis Guay were captured by al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) on 14 December 2008, and held hostage in the Sahara Desert for 130 days. Fowler was reported missing along with Guay, deputy director of the Sudan task force in Ottawa, and their Niger- based driver, Soumana Moukaila, after their car was found on the evening of 14 December 2008 about northwest of Niamey, after visiting the Canadian-owned Samira Hill Gold Mine. On 16 December, the Front des Forces de Redressement (FFR) claimed on its website that its members kidnapped Fowler and three others, saying that they targeted diplomats who support the Niger government led by President Mamadou Tandja. However, Seydou Maiga Kaocen, speaking for the organization, stated that the \\"FFR formally denies any involvement in the abduction of Mr. Robert Fowler, UN envoy to Niger. ... We hope that Mr Fowler and his delegation will be released as soon as possible\\", he followed. In February 2009, Al-Qaeda Organization in the Islamic Maghreb claimed responsibility for Fowler's kidnapping.http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0219/p99s01-duts.html In 2003, 32 Europeans had been taken hostage in the Sahara in a series of abductions run by El Para, an agent of the Algerian intelligence service, the DRS. In February 2008 two Austrians were captured in Tunisia and taken via Algeria to Mali and freed later that year. All these kidnappings were attributed to Al- Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb previously known as the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC).\\"West's made-up terror links to blame for killing\\" The Independent, 2009Le Monde Diplomatique, February 2005 Release Moukaila was released in March 2009.

After it had been collecting waste since the 1960s, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) analyzed the property and creek in 1979, finding high levels of heavy metal, polychlorinated biphenyls, and some 140 other chemical substances. It is known as one of the primary motivations for the passage of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or Superfund Act of 1980. While the widely publicized Love Canal disaster is often credited as the reason the Superfund law was passed, Love Canal activist Lois Gibbs has said that Love Canal looked like a suburban community, while \\"Valley of the Drums became the visualization of the problem.\\" Officially, cleanup began at the site in 1983 and ended in 1990, though later problems have been reported and investigated.  History  Dumping and pollution = The Valley of the Drums is a 23-acre (9.3 hectare) toxic waste site in Brooks, Kentucky in northern Bullitt County, near Louisville. It became a collection point for toxic wastes starting sometime in the 1960s. It caught the attention of state officials when some of the drums caught fire and burned for more than a week in 1966. At that time there were no laws to address the storage or containment of toxic wastes, and the site continued to be unregulated for another decade. In 1977, the owner (also inferred to be the primary \\"dumper\\") of the site, A.L. Taylor, died. It is unclear who owned the property subsequently, and county tax records show that the property taxes have gone unpaid for several years. In 1978, a Kentucky Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection (KDNREP) investigation of the property revealed that over 100,000 drums of waste were delivered to the site, of which 27,000 drums were buried and the remaining containers were discharged directly into pits and trenches. Over a period of time, the conditions of many of the drums on site deteriorated and the contents spilled onto the ground where they were flushed into a nearby creek by storm water runoff. Frequent complaints about strong odors along the creek bed were received from adjacent property owners. = Cleanup and legislation = In 1979, large quantities of contaminants were carried into the creek by the spring snow melts, which caused the EPA to respond immediately. The EPA analyzed the property and creek, finding high levels of heavy metal, polychlorinated biphenyls, and some 140 other chemical substances. The same year, the EPA initiated an emergency clean-up of the worst of the leaking drums. Workers on the ground quickly realized that the scope of the problem was far beyond their abilities. After news of the problems there became public, the site was used by members of Congress as one of the reasons the proposed Superfund law was needed. While the widely publicized Love Canal disaster is often credited as the reason the Superfund law was passed, Love Canal activist Lois Gibbs has said that Love Canal looked like a suburban community, while \\"Valley of the Drums became the visualization of the problem.\\" Cleanup began at the site in 1983 and officially ended in 1990, although problems continued to be reported for many years. An environmental audit of the site in 2003 found PCBs in the sediment surrounding the area, and further testing was ordered. In December, 2008, EPA inspectors found about four dozen rusted metal drums on land just outside the part of the dump that it capped and fenced in the 1980s, including a portion of Jefferson Memorial Forest. New cleanup work was being considered at the site .

The game determined the 2000 football champion of the Big 12 Conference. The Oklahoma Sooners, winners of the South division of the Big 12, narrowly beat the Kansas State Wildcats, who won the North division, by a score of 27-24.Recap This was the first time the two teams met in the Big 12 Championship Game, as they would meet again in the 2003 edition. The Wildcats were coached by Bill Snyder. They came into the game with at 10-2 record, including a 6-2 record in Big 12 play. The Sooners were coached by Bob Stoops, in just his second year at the helm after serving as defensive coordinator at Florida (1996-98) and Kansas State (1991-95). Oklahoma came into the game with an 11-0 record including an 8-0 mark in conference play. Leading up to the game The Wildcats had already lost to the Sooners in mid-October, a game played in Manhattan. The Sooners won that contest, 41-31. The Wildcats had hoped to even up the score and earn a first- ever trip to the BCS, not to mention end Oklahoma's perfect season. Oklahoma had not lost a game coming into the championship game. After winning the game, they would go on to defeat Florida State in the 2001 Orange Bowl, which served as the BCS National Championship Game that year, earning the program's 7th claimed national championship. Game summary In a scene filled with national championship tension and with two teams very familiar with one another, No. 1 Oklahoma edged No. 7/8 Kansas State, 27-24, for the Sooners‚Äô first Big 12 football title. As OU won a school-record 12th game and advanced to the Bowl Championship Series, the battle royale was about as even as pre- billed for the first 30 minutes. The Sooners scored first in what would prove to be the decisive field goal in the three-point victory as Tim Duncan connected on a 33-yarder. K-State then rallied for 10 unanswered points, starting with a 10-yard scoring run by Jonathan Beasley on the first play of the second quarter. After an OU punt, KSU mounted a 12-play, 57-yard drive for a Jamie Rheem field goal from 22 yards. Oklahoma stormed back to block a Wildcats‚Äô punt as Josh Norman stepped in front of a KSU boot. Three plays later, quarterback Josh Heupel connected with tight end Trent Smith for one of Smith‚Äôs record eight championship receptions and the tying touchdown with 2:56 left in the half. In the second half, OU took a short-lived lead at 17-10 with 5:54 left in the third quarter as Heupel rushed over the goal line from seven yards. Less than two minutes later, Aaron Lockett cruised 58 yards on a punt runback for the first kick return for a touchdown in the Big 12 Championship. Late in the third quarter and early in the final period, OU made the critical drive of the game. Heupel found Andre Woolfolk with a pass to the back of the end zone, and Duncan‚Äôs kick made it 24-17 Sooners with 14:24 left in regulation. A calculated gamble by Bob Stoops and Sooners‚Äô special teams‚Äô coaches sent Duncan out to try his longest field goal of the season - a 46-yarder - with 1:25 on the clock. Duncan‚Äôs successful try was his longest of the year by six yards and gave Oklahoma just enough breathing room. The elusive Beasley drove the Wildcats 60 yards in six plays in a span of 1:19. Oklahoma scooped up the ensuing onside kick and ran the final six seconds off the clock. For the fifth year in succession, the designated home team was victorious in the Dr Pepper Championship. Scoring summary First Quarter OU (3-0) - Tim Duncan 33-yard field goal; 7:16 Second Quarter KSU (3-7) - Jonathan Beasley 10-yard run (Jamie Rheem kick); 14:54 KSU (3-10) - Rheem 22-yard field goal; 7:58 OU (10-10) - Trent Smith 1-yard pass from Josh Heupel (Duncan kick); 2:56 Third Quarter OU (17-10) - Josh Heupel 7-yard run (Duncan kick); 5:54 KSU (17-17) - Aaron Lockett 58-yard punt return (Rheem kick) Fourth Quarter OU (24-17) - Andre Woolfolk 17-yard pass from Heupel (Duncan kick); 14:24 OU (27-17) - Duncan 46-yard field goal; 1:25 KSU (27-24) - Quincy Morgan 16-yard pass from Beasley (Rheem kick); 0:06 After the game The Sooners went on to play in the 2001 Orange Bowl and won their 7th national championship against the Florida State Seminoles, 13-2.

It is the original manor house of Crawley, and was built in the early 15th century and rebuilt in the mid-16th century. It now has a modern exterior and is disused, but the old structure is still in place inside. Situated in a prominent position facing both the High Street and The Boulevard, two of Crawley town centre's main roads, its name commemorates an ancient elm tree which stood outside for hundreds of years and was one of Crawley's landmarks. History Although there was evidence of a small settlement by the 11th century, Crawley started to develop as a village in the 13th century when a charter was granted for a market. By the late 14th century, there was enough wealth in the area to justify the building of a manor house. Like other buildings of the era, it was timber-framed; many of these were demolished when the New Town was laid out after the Second World War, and Tree House is now the oldest such building on the High Street. In the mid-16th century, in the midst of a period of rapid construction in the village, the building was substantially extended. Around this time, brick started to replace timber as the predominant building material in the area; the extension used timber, but soon afterwards a brick \\"skin\\" was added around the exterior. This remains in place today. John Leech's residence By the 18th century, Tree House lost its original use and passed into private ownership as part of the Worth Park estate, a country estate which covered large parts of Crawley (which was by this time a small town). By 1780 the building had started its long association with the medical profession: it was home to a family of doctors for about 130 years, although it was rented from the estate landowner for the whole time. The caricaturist John Leech also lived at the house for several years from 1833, while training as a medical student. He worked on the magazine Punch, which at the time was edited by fellow Crawley resident Mark Lemon, and illustrated Charles Dickens's series of Christmas stories in the 1840s. Later, the parish council (which became Crawley Urban District Council in 1956 and Crawley Borough Council in 1974) bought Tree House and used it to house various council services. These have since been moved to new purpose-built accommodation, leaving the building's future uncertain. In particular, it lies within the area covered by the Crawley \\"Town Centre North\\" masterplan, which proposes major changes and redevelopment for that part of the town centre. The latest version of the masterplan, dated September 2008, recommends that Tree House should be kept, while allowing \\"justified\\" alterations or extensions to be made. solar wing (south front, facing The Boulevard). The blacked-out sign showed the services offered by the voluntary sector and Borough Council in the building until 2006 Until the late 20th century, a large barn-style hall stood in the gardens behind Tree House. It was built in the early 15th century as a moot hall‚Äîa mediaeval meeting place for villagers to discuss issues. The two-storey timber-framed building had four bays on the ground floor and a long room on the first floor. Threatened with demolition and replacement by an office block extension in the 1970s, it was instead dismantled, transported to the Weald and Downland Open Air Museum at Singleton and rebuilt there. At the museum, the building is now called the \\"Upper Hall\\". The building's name, which seems to have been used from early in its history, refers to one of Crawley's oldest and most longstanding landmarks. The \\"Crawley Elm\\" stood immediately opposite; an ancient, substantial tree, it predated the building. A historical work about the county of Sussex published in 1835 devoted almost all of its summary of Crawley to a discussion of the tree. Another 19th- century author of a work about trees described its \\"tall, straight stem which ascends to a height of 70 feet [21 m] ... [and] the fantastic ruggedness of its roots\\". At that time its trunk had been partly hollowed out to form a small room which was used for various purposes: as a temporary lodging place for travellers to stay overnight; as a meeting room; and as a billet. The room had a circumference of about , a door and some brickwork. Although the tree was already dying at this stage, parts of it remained until the New Town started to be built in the 1940s. Architecture The west face of the building in 2008 Externally, Tree House has no pre-19th century features, but the original hall house remains inside the external brickwork. It occupies an L-shaped corner plot and consists of a Great hall (south to north, facing High Street) and a solar (west to east, facing the Boulevard). There is a Sussex stone chimney breast at the corner. The solar is in better condition, and has three bays and substantial exposed roof trusses with king-posts and tie-beams. The roofline is lower than that of the Great hall section, which is partly covered with slabs of Horsham stone, a material used often in the area. The 18th-century work added a new wing on the west side; changes were made at the northern end in the following century; and the most recent remodelling in 1936 resulted in more changes on this side. The windows were, until recently, boarded up but most were modern. The building today Tree House was listed at Grade II by English Heritage on 21 June 1948, and is one of 100 listed buildings and structures in the Borough of Crawley. It is owned by Crawley Borough Council and was used until 2006 as a venue for various council-run services and voluntary-sector organisations, such as a Citizens Advice Bureau and a bereavement counselling service. However, it was considered unsuitable for this purpose, being cramped and unpleasant for staff and visitors, for example, there were no toilets on site. Also, space between the original walls and the more modern external brickwork had become a nesting site for vermin. These issues coincided with the building being designated as within the zone covered by the ¬£700m \\"Town Centre North\\" regeneration programme. In response to a request from the voluntary sector tenants, to provide better accommodation, the Council moved all of the functions previously undertaken in Tree House to a new building (the Orchard) elsewhere in the town centre in November 2006. The building remained empty for some years until, in March 2010, it was identified as a possible location for the town's museum. In May 2018 Crawley Museum opened at The Tree.

The Office The Office was in Chancery Lane, near the Holborn end. The business of the office was to enrol commissions, pardons, patents, warrants, etc., that had passed the Great Seal in addition to other business in Chancery. In the early history of the Court of Chancery, the Six Clerks and their under-clerks appear to have acted as the attorneys of the suitors. As business increased, these under-clerks became a distinct body, and were recognized by the court under the denomination of sworn clerks, or clerks in court. The advance of commerce, with its consequent accession of wealth, so multiplied the subjects requiring the judgment of a Court of Equity, that the limits of a public office were found wholly inadequate to supply a sufficient number of officers to conduct the business of the suitors. Hence originated the \\"Solicitors of the Court of Chancery\\".Wheatley (1893) fn to entry for 12 July 1660 The Office also facilitated Chancery claims by litigants in forma pauperis (impoverished), including children and those suffering from mental illness.

It is a triumphant song of the transformation undergone by Barcelona since the mid-19th century. Consisting of 46 quatrains of Alexandrine verses, and a re-editing process started in 1874 and completed in 1875, it is the fruit of a labour started in 1883. The author then lengthened and amended it three times, the last two shortly before its publication. Analysis The first three stanzas present the city protected by the mountain of Montju√Øc, identified with Alcides (Hercules), the mythic founder of Barcino according to a legend that Verdaguer had already picked up on in The Atl√†ntida (1878). Next are sixteen quatrains, in which the poet celebrates the demolition of the walls and the extension of the city (1859), with a prophecy of bursting growth, beyond the Collserola mountain range and the Besos and Llobregat rivers, as if \\"Paris of the Seine\\" had been transplanted to Catalonia. However, the three following stanzas, in the name of the homeland, reject any awe of the French capital, affirming instead the personality of Barcelona, which had been the Catalan center of a medieval Mediterranean empire and ¬´She shone on Spanish lands as eastern star¬ª. In the 23rd to 40th stanzas, the poet evokes the historical characters and the monuments that distinguish the city. The six final stanzas, written from the perspective of the Cathedral, imaginatively transfigured into King Jaume I, formulate the ideological conclusion, the providential perspective, in which Barcelona and Catalonia are exhorted to promote economic progress, based on their industries, but without ever renouncing the Catholic tradition, since in the end ¬´God alone brings down or lifts up peoples¬ª. Reception In spite of the rhetorical flourishes denounced by some critics, the poem, rewarded with an extraordinary prize in the Floral Games (Jocs florals) of 1883, expresses faithfully the expectations of the elite of the period. This is confirmed by the fact that the Ajuntament (city council) published a popular edition of the poem, with a print run of 100,000 copies. On the other hand, the poem has also provoked numerous imitations and responses, noteworthy of which are the \\"New Ode to Barcelona\\" by Joan Maragall and the \\"Ode to Barcelona\\" by Pere Quart.Diccionari de la Literatura Catalana, 2008 The full, annotated text of the poem is included in Selected Poems of Jacint Verdaguer: A Bilingual Edition, edited and translated by Ronald Puppo, with an introduction by Ramon Pinyol Torrents, University of Chicago Press, 2007.

Their strip is coloured navy Blue, Red and White. They currently play in Durham/Northumberland 1, the seventh tier of the English rugby union system, having been relegated from North 1 East as at the end of the 2017-18 season. Northern field three senior teams. These are the first team, Northern Wanderers (2nd team) and Northern Panthers (3rd team). Northern have a very large successful mini and youth rugby set-up.  History  Northern Football Club was founded in 1875 as Elswick Football Club but was renamed in its second season changing the team's colours to red white and blue, which have remained the team strip throughout its history and is the oldest Rugby Football Club in Newcastle upon Tyne. Northern originally played at Mill Inn, Westgate but were forced to alternate playing grounds and remained without a 'home ground' for over 60 years. In 1937, McCracken Park was purchased and was officially named after the then Club President Angus McCracken and has operated at McCracken Park ever since. In 1956, squash courts were added to the club, with further courts added in 1974. On 18 December 1994, the present clubhouse was opened at a cost of ¬£1 million. Northern Football Club was very successful during its early history, producing several international players. The first player to be capped directly from the club was England half back Mason Scott in 1890. In its 125-year history Northern has also supplied Presidents of the Rugby Football Union and the Scottish Rugby Union. In its early history the club would regularly put out six teams plus a Youth and a veterans side. During the late 19th century, William Cail, the Northern FC President, became the president of the RFU (1892‚Äì1894) during the time of the split between the RFU and the Northern Union. The last player capped at international level directly from Northern was Feidlim McLoughlin, who was selected to play for Ireland in 1977. Though many players have played for Northern who have later become international players and, including Jonathan Webb, Brian Keen, David Rees and Colin White for England, Scott Hastings and Jim Pollock for Scotland, Rory Best for Ireland and Hennie le Roux for South Africa. A past player of note is John Elders, who also coached the Senior XV also coached England in the 1970s. Elders was the first coach to take an England side to South Africa and win a test match. Northern's local rivals are Gosforth RFC. In season 1998‚Äì99 Northern were narrowly beaten by Doncaster R.F.C. for promotion to the National Leagues. Youth team Northern Football Club run youth teams for Under 6s to under 17s, playing fixtures primarily throughout the North East but also travelling further afield to compete in tournaments. The younger teams only play touch rugby, until they are old enough to tackle safely. Because there are so many mini and junior members at the club, training is split into three different locations. These are Northern's home - McCracken Park, Gosforth Academy and Druid Park.

On 2 December 2008, it was announced on the People Connection Blog that Ficlets would permanently be closed as of 15 January 2009. On 6 December 2008, a banner was placed at the header of Ficlets pages that announced the closure of the site and a pop-up window was added to the main page that read ‚ÄúFiclets is going away soon :(\\". Lawver attempted to save the site to no avail, so he began a \\"Ficlets Graveyard\\" to archive all the ficlets written prior to the closing of the site. Lawver announced on 10 January 2009 that, with the help of Ficlets.com programmer Jason Garber and design team Viget Labs, a replacement site entitled Ficly.com would be launched. At the time of the announcement, the Ficly front page consisted of a logo (subtitling the format \\"A better, shorter story\\"), a statement of not being active yet, and a form to sign up an e-mail address for notification of the official launch. Lawver stated that the Ficly.com team is \\"slowly making progress\\" in constructing the site, referencing the possible launch date as \\"maybe by ficlets' 2nd birthday at the beginning of March\\". All content on ficlets.com was licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.5 license and viewable to any patron of the site. Users who completed the free registration process could submit their own ficlets (either completely original, inspired by a Creative Commons-licensed Flickr image, or as a prequel or sequel to another's ficlet), host a draft of a ficlet in progress which was not viewable by others, maintain a user profile, comment on and rate other's stories, contact other users via private messages, and maintain a list of favorite ficlet authors and stories. There was also a Ficlets blog wherein Lawver and science fiction author John Scalzi posted entries in an assortment of categories, including Book Tour Diaries, a Ficlets Spotlight, and interviews with published authors. For registration, the site accepted OpenID and AOL/AIM screen names.  Creation  The site was created in late 2006 by AOL system architect and lead developer Kevin Lawver, who handled the back end website programming, as a repository for ficlets. The concept for the site originated with Lawver being a \\"frustrated writer\\", unable to find the time to complete a fictional work; as an alternative, he conceived ficlets ‚Äî a format that allowed a work to be written in \\"five or ten minutes at work during lunch or [during] a break\\" and the site was to provide \\"inspiration\\" via \\"pictures, phrases or other stories\\" as well as circumventing, through the prequel or sequel option, having \\"to start from scratch when I had time to write\\". The name of the site and fiction form were derived from a unison of words: fiction and chiclets, specifically the \\"lets\\" part of the later meant to indicate \\"a small version of\\". An additional four-person AOL developer team provided time and effort in the creation of the website: * Jason Garber, who handled the front end website programming. * Ari Kushimoto, who assisted with the user interface design and programming. * Cindy Li, who assisted with the user interface design and programming as well as aiding in the promotion of the site. * Jenna Marino, who handled the website and logo design. Science fiction author John Scalzi was a principal contributor to the site from its launch as a blogger, though he departed that position at the end of 2007.  Content  The site hosted \\"ficlets\\", not strictly linear very short stories between 64- and 1,024-bytes in length. Ficlets are modular in that each is intended, but not required, to be a stand-alone story but once posted any registered user could continue the narrative thread by writing an indefinite number of prequels or sequels to the ficlet. All ficlets are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.5 License. Mature Content was allowed within ficlet stories, but explicit pornography, obscenity and \\"hate speech\\" were banned. Ficlet stories with mature content were required to be designated as such, thus allowing only registered users who opted to view mature content the ability to read the stories. The use of the intellectual property of others, such as fan fiction allow, was likewise banned from Ficlets. The use of real people was also forbidden in ficlet stories, unless they were public figures, although slanderous or libelous remarks directed at those public figures were prohibited. As of 4 January 2009, the site hosted almost 49,000 ficlet stories, over 80,000 comments on those stories, and had in excess of 10,000 registered members. = Notable contributors = Several published authors, aside from blog contributor and science fiction author John Scalzi, participated on the site with original content. These included: * Science fiction and fantasy author Rachel Swirsky, who contributed four pieces (entitled: \\"Whistbone's Chase\\", \\"DNA Designs\\", \\"My Way Out\\", and \\"Falling Further In\\"). * Science fiction author Brian Francis Slattery, who contributed three pieces (entitled: \\"Asbestos\\", \\"Invisible Wars\\", and \\"Telescope\\") * Star Trek acting alumni Wil Wheaton, who contributed nine pieces (entitled: \\"The Fifteenth\\", \\"They Don't Come Out at Night\\", \\"Nevermore\\", \\"Snowfall\\", \\"A Godawful Small Affair\\", \\"Wallace\\", \\"Real Life\\", \\"An Unremarkable Factory\\", and \\"Hunter and Hunted\\").  Awards  In 2008, Ficlets was a Gold Award Winner in the category of Social/Networking from W3 Awards. In March 2008, Ficlets won the CSS category and was nominated for the Community category of the SxSW Web Awards.  Critical reception  Within the site's first week of operation it had received nearly 400 blog posts regarding it, including a solicitation for new users from Boing Boing. Mike Linksvayer of Creative Commons was particularly \\"excited\\" with the creation and usage of the site. On 6 and 9 February 2008, the CBC radio show Spark ran a profile on Ficlets, including an interview with Kevin Lawver and the reading of two ficlets from the site.

Pola de Siero was founded by a charter of King Alfonso X in 1270.El Libro de Siero, Gaspar Fern√°ndez Cuesta, Patronato Municipal de Cultura de Siero, 2002, On the site prior to that date there was a hostel which provided accommodation and sustenance for pilgrims travelling the Way of St. James (Camino de Santiago), en route to or from Santiago de Compostela. The charter allowed the formation of the town, imposed an annual tax on the inhabitants to be paid to the crown, and granted them a license to hold a weekly market in the town square, Plaza les Campes. This market, a feature of Pola de Siero which continues, every Tuesday, to this day; was the decisive factor in the development of the town.P√°ginas de la Historia Del Concejo De Siero, Maria Dolores Alonso Cabeza, Oviedo, 1992, With the market, the town became the focal point of a large rural area of fertile land, and thereafter other commercial and administrative functions followed.

He acceded to the position of Rebbe following the death of his older brother, Rabbi Dovid Bornsztain, the third Sochatchover Rebbe, who died in the Warsaw Ghetto during the Holocaust. Rabbi Dovid's children were also killed during the Holocaust, leaving no survivors. As Rabbi Chanoch Henoch had moved to Mandatory Palestine and established a beth midrash in Jerusalem during the 1920s, his assumption of the title of Admor relocated the Sochatchover dynasty from its home in Poland to the new state of Israel, where it flourishes to this day. Biography Chanoch Henoch was the second son of Rabbi Shmuel Bornsztain, the Second Sochatchover Rebbe, and his wife, Yuta Leah. He grew up in the presence of his illustrious grandfather, Rabbi Avrohom Bornsztain, also known as the Avnei Nezer, who founded the Sochatchover dynasty. In 1924, Rabbi Chanoch accompanied his brother Rabbi Dovid to Palestine for the purpose of acquiring land to establish a Hasidic settlement. Rabbi Dovid put a down payment on a plot of land south of Ramle. When he returned to Poland to raise the rest of the money, however, his plan was thwarted by an economic depression that hit Poland shortly after his return. He eventually lost his rights to the land, as well as the money he had invested in it. Meanwhile, Rabbi Chanoch stayed in Jerusalem, living first in the Bucharim neighborhood and then settling in the new Bayit VeGan neighborhood, where he established a beth midrash (study hall). Upon the death of their father, the Second Sochatchover Rebbe, in 1926, Rabbi Dovid acceded to the leadership of the Sochatchover Hasidim, while Rabbi Chanoch continued to live and study in Palestine. After World War II, when Rabbi Chanoch heard about the death of his brother in the Warsaw Ghetto, he was inconsolable. Later, he accepted the request of the Sochatchover Hasidim to be their leader. He established his court in Jerusalem, preferring to remain in that city even during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, when his followers in Tel Aviv urged him to join him there.Growise, Yisroel Alter.

Turner Professor of New Testament and Early Christianity at Rice University in Houston, Texas. She came to Rice University as a full professor in 2006, after receiving tenure at Illinois Wesleyan University in 2004. DeConick is the author of several books in the field of Early Christian Studies and is best known for her work on the Gospel of Thomas and ancient Gnosticism.  Early life and education  DeConick received her PhD in Near Eastern Studies at the University of Michigan in 1993. Her doctoral work was focused on rereading the Gospel of Thomas as a text that was composed by early second century Christians who were mystics associated with the Jewish Christian tradition from Jerusalem. It was supervised by Jarl Fossum with Gilles Quispel as her dissertation examiner. DeConick‚Äôs work on the Gospel of Thomas as an early Christian text from Syrian Christianity had a big impact on the field, rethinking the text as a reflection of very early orthodox mysticism rather than Gnosticism.  Academic career  DeConick is a historian of early Jewish and Christian thought. Her work focuses on New Testament and pre-Nicene literature, non- canonical gospels, gnostic literature and movements, mysticism and esotericism in early Christianity, new religious movements past and present, the biosocial study of religion, and a theoretical point of view called post-constructivism. She is known also for her original work on the Gospel of Judas, a Coptic Gnostic gospel rediscovered in 2006. Her work has been called \\"revisionist,\\" challenging to seek answers beyond the conventional. When National Geographic released the first English translation of the Gospel of Judas, a second- century text discovered in Egypt in the 1970s DeConick was the first scholar who seriously challenged the National Geographic \\"official\\" interpretation of a good Judas. She contended that the Gospel of Judas is not about a ‚Äúgood‚Äù Judas. Rather it represents a gospel parody about a ‚Äúdemon‚Äù Judas written by a particular group of Gnostic Christians known as the Sethians. DeConick published her criticisms in the New York Times and in her book called The Thirteenth Apostle: What the Gospel of Judas Really Says. She was featured in CNN‚Äôs documentary on the Gospel of Judas that premiered in 2015 on the TV series \\"Finding Jesus.‚Äù DeConick is the founder and executive editor of Gnosis: Journal of Gnostic Studies (Leiden: Brill) and a recruiting editor for the monograph series Nag Hammadi and Manichaean Studies (Leiden: Brill). She is active in the Society of Biblical Literature as the founding chair of the ‚ÄúMysticism, Esotericism and Gnosticism in Antiquity Section,‚Äù and the past-chair of the Committee for the Status of Women in the Profession. DeConick also organized and chaired for many years the Early Jewish and Christian Mysticism Group. She is also affiliated with the North American Patristics Society, and the International Association for Coptic Studies.  Honors  DeConick‚Äôs book, The Gnostic New Age: How a Countercultural Spirituality Revolutionized Religion from Antiquity to Today, published by Columbia University Press in 2016, won the Figure Foundation Award for the best book published by a university press in philosophy and religion.

They were regular performers on the Grand Ole Opry in the late 1920s and are believed to have been the first group to release a record recorded in Nashville, Tennessee.

The band's name was suggested by Opry founder George D. Hay, who often gave the Opry's early string bands more colorful, rural-sounding names.Jack Hurst, Nashville's Grand Ole Opry (New York: H.N. Abrams, 1975), 83. In 1928, the Gully Jumpers were one of the Opry's most consistent acts, appearing on the show more times than any other group. That same year, they released the first record recorded in Nashville, which contained two tracks entitled \\"The Tennessee Waltz\\" (not to be confused with the more famous Pee Wee King song) and \\"Little Red Caboose Behind the Train.\\" In October 1928, they recorded \\"Stone Rag\\", which was written by Humphrey Bate and His Possum Hunters fiddler Oscar Stone, and a tune entitled \\"Robertson County.\\"Wolfe, Notes, 6. In spite of the losses of Warmack and Arrington, the Gully Jumpers continued performing on the Opry into the 1960s. Fellow Opry pioneers such as Sid Harkreader and Kirk McGee often stepped in to play fiddle for the band in place of Arrington. Hutcherson, who was the last surviving original member of the band when he died in 1980, was a pioneer of the finger-picked guitar style, and was cited as a key influence by long-time Opry guitarist Sam McGee and early Country music star \\"Mother Maybelle\\" Carter.Wolfe, \\"Notes\\", 7.

Most of the Beijing Guozijian's buildings were built during the Ming Dynasty and it remains an important heritage site in China. During the Hundred Days' Reform of the Qing Dynasty, the education and administration of education functions of Guozijian was mainly replaced by the Imperial University of Peking (Jingshi Daxuetang), later known as Peking University. The Guozijian was shut down in 1905. The Guozijian, often translated into English as the Imperial Academy or Imperial College, was the national central institute of learning in ancient Chinese dynasties. It was the highest institute of learning in China's traditional educational system. Emperors in imperial China would also frequently visit the Guozijian to read Confucian classics to thousands of students. History The Guozijian was first built in 1306 during the 24th year of Zhiyuan Reign of the Yuan Dynasty, and was reconstructed and renovated on a large scale during Yongle and Zhengtong reigns of the Ming Dynasty. The administrative officials of Guozijian were called Chief (, J√¨ji«î), Dean of Studies (, Sƒ´y√®), or Proctor (, JiƒÅnch√©ng). The students who studied at the Guozijian were called \\"Jiansheng\\" (, Ji√†nshƒìng), and they mainly studied the Confucian classics. Location and layout The Guozijian is situated at the central area of the Guozijian Street and adjoining several other well known imperial structures of Beijing, and the complex of Guozijian accords with the Chinese tradition which dictates that the temple should be on the \\"left\\" and the school or college on the \\"right\\". To the east of the Guozijian, lies the Confucius Temple, the second largest Confucius temple in all of China, and the Yonghegong Temple, the largest Lama Temple in Beijing. The whole complex of Guozijian faces south, and it has a total building area of more than 10,000 square meters or 107,639 square feet.

It was 1971 and Mariano Martinez had just opened his first restaurant in Dallas, Texas. It was an instant sensation. However, on opening night guests were complaining about the consistency of the blended margaritas that Mariano developed using his father's secret recipe. They complained that some were nice and cold, some were melted down and some were not cold at all. Mariano immediately addressed these complaints with his bartenders. They threatened to quit, telling Mariano that the margaritas were too hard to make, especially consistently. After a sleepless night Mariano went to get his morning cup of coffee at a local 7-11 store. When he walked in, he noticed a little girl pulling a frozen Slurpee from a machine, and it hit him. If he could make his margaritas using precise portions that he could control ahead of time instead of in the middle of a rush, and make them in large quantities and freeze the batches in a machine, his problems would be solved. Easier said than done. It took countless hours of hard work and ingenuity. Mariano spent day and night tinkering with an old soft-serve ice cream machine, and souping it up like you would with a car. The result? The World's First Frozen Margarita Machine. The word about his frozen margaritas spread and Mariano's became the destination for margaritas in Dallas. And the frozen margarita machine soon became standard equipment in restaurants ‚Äì exploding the popularity of tequila and early Tex-Mex cuisine both in Texas and worldwide. Mariano's invention is such a part of our culture that, in October 2005, the World's First Frozen Margarita Machine was inducted into the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C. In September 2010 it was named one of the ‚ÄúTop Ten Inventions from the National Museum of American History's Collection. Margarita mix, traditionally lime flavored, is put in a refrigerated container with a spinning agitator. The user is able to dispense margaritas from such a device for extended periods of time, usually up to 12 hours, without losing any quality in the taste of the margaritas. A margarita machine may be purchased in its finished form or built from cooler with special equipment.

He acceded to the position of Rebbe following the death of his father, Rabbi Chanoch Henoch Bornsztain, the fourth Rebbe of Sochatchov. He was officially known as the Sochatchover-Radomsker Rebbe, having also accepted the leadership of the Radomsk Hasidic dynasty upon the request of its surviving Hasidim, whose leaders had been murdered in the Holocaust. He served as Rebbe for only four years; he was killed in a traffic accident at the age of 34. Early life Bornsztain's father, Rabbi Chanoch Henoch, was the son of Rabbi Shmuel Bornsztain, the Shem MiShmuel, and the grandson of the Avnei Nezer, founder of the Sochatchover dynasty. His mother, Freidel, was a daughter of Rabbi Noson Nochum of Krimelov and a granddaughter of the Kenesses Yechezkel of Radomsk. At his brit milah, which was delayed until his sixth week of life due to illness, he was named Menachem Shlomo after his paternal great-grandfather, Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Kotzk, and his maternal ancestor, Rabbi Shlomo Hakohen Rabinowicz, the Tiferes Shlomo of Radomsk.Growise, Yisroel Alter. \\"The Sochatchover Rebbe, Harav Menachem Shlomo Bornstein, zt\\"l, 40 Years Since His Tragic Passing\\". Hamodia Features section, 27 August 2009, pp. C4-5. As a young child, Bornsztain was noted for his clever mind and ability to express himself. He attended a private Talmud Torah in Jerusalem and became a student at the Knesses Chizkiyahu yeshiva in Zikhron Ya'akov in 1950, where he showed great diligence in his Torah learning. The rosh yeshiva, Rabbi Noah Shimonowitz, arranged chavrusos for him with the yeshiva's top students, as well as with the rosh yeshiva himself, to develop young Bornsztain's abilities. Two years later, when Rabbi Elyah Lopian entered the yeshiva as Mashgiach Ruchani, Bornsztain developed a very close relationship with this Mussar giant. Marriage Bornsztain married the daughter of Rabbi Daniel Movshowitz, one of the rabbis of Tel Aviv. Thereafter, his father, the Sochatchover Rebbe, who lived in Jerusalem, dispatched him to Tel Aviv in order to oversee the Sochatchover shtiebel there. Bornsztain moved to Tel Aviv and learned in Kollel Beis Yehudah, led by Rabbi Michel Feinstein, the son-in- law of the Brisker Rav. In 1960, he was officially appointed Rav of the Sochatchover shteibel on Rashi Street in Tel Aviv. As Rav of the Sochatchover shtiebel, Bornsztain established times for Torah shiurim, most of which he delivered himself, drawing large crowds from throughout the neighborhood. He also worked to convince secular families to send their children to yeshivas. He was known to spend countless hours dispensing solace and advice to people who came to him with their troubles. When the Rav of Tel Aviv's Yad Eliyahu neighborhood died suddenly during Hanukkah 1963, a new leader was sought to lead and unite the various factions in the neighborhood. Although he was only 30 years old, Bornsztain was unanimously selected for the post after delivering a brilliant speech in the local synagogue. He was inducted on 6 January 1965 in a festive ceremony. His father, Rabbi Chanoch Henoch, was unable to attend due to poor health. As Rav of the Yad Eliyahu neighborhood, Bornsztain supervised the renovation of old shuls, the expansion of Torah shiurim, and the establishment of tzedakah and chesed organizations. At the same time, Bornsztain was chosen to lead Kollel Keser Torah Radomsk in Bnei Brak, named after the network of 36 yeshivas in pre-war Poland established by the fourth Radomsker Rebbe and headed by Bornsztain's uncle, Rabbi David Moshe Hakohen Rabinowicz, who had been murdered in the Warsaw Ghetto. He assumed this position on 3 May 1965, commuting daily between Tel Aviv and Bnei Brak. Becoming Rebbe With the sudden death of his father, Rabbi Chanoch Henoch, on 23 September 1965, Rabbi Menachem Shlomo was asked by the Sochatchover Hasidim to become their Rebbe. Although he initially refused, he eventually agreed to be crowned as the fifth Rebbe of the dynasty. As a descendant of the Radomsker dynasty (his grandfather, the Second Sochatchover Rebbe, Rabbi Shmuel Bornsztain, had married the granddaughter of the First Radomsker Rebbe, Shlomo Rabinowicz), Bornsztain was also asked by the Radomsker Hasidim who had survived the Holocaust to become their Rebbe as well. After consulting with gedolei Torah, Bornsztain officially became known as the Sochatchover- Radomsker Rebbe. His first move as Rebbe was to establish a yeshiva where he himself gave shiurim. He gave himself over completely to his Hasidim, his students, and the community at large. On 10 August 1969 (26 Av 5729), Bornsztain was traveling home by taxi from a visit to an elderly Hasid hospitalized at Tel HaShomer. An army vehicle crashed into his car head-on, throwing Bornsztain from the cab. Twenty-four hours later, he died of his injuries. He left behind his Rebbetzin and children, all under the age of bar mitzvah. A few years after his death, his Hasidim crowned his eldest son, Shmuel, as the sixth Sochatchover Rebbe. His second son, Avrohom Nosson Bornsztain, was appointed as Rav of the Radomsker shul in Bnei Brak.

The ruins cover an area of 12 hectares on top of a volcanic dome.INAH Bulletin Hallazgos en Xochit√©catl, 25 May 08, accessed 8 December Serra Puche & de la Torre, 2002 Cacaxtla y Xochit√©catl (Gu√≠a de viajeros) Xochitecatl, unlike other contemporary sites, appears to have been a purely ceremonial centre for a population dispersed through the surrounding countryside rather than the centre of an urban area. Etymology Xochitecatl is formed from two Nahuatl words, x≈çchitl (flower) and tecatl (person), hence the person of flowers or the lineage of flowers.Morales G√≥mez 1998 Location Xochitecatl is located in a dominant position upon the summit of a 4 km-wide extinct volcano that forms a range of hills that rises approximately 200 meters above the floor of the Puebla- Tlaxcala Valley; the so-called Atlachino-Nativitas-Xochitecatl block, which is located in the centre of the valley. Xochitecatl has clear views across the surrounding valleys to the neighbouring volcanoes of Popocatepetl, Iztaccihuatl and La Malinche. The rivers Atoyac and Zahuapan flow close to the site. The site is the focal point of an area distinguished by its high agricultural productivity, sometimes named \\"the Mesoamerican Mesopotamia\\", because of its fertile lands between the rivers Atoyac and Zayapan.David M. Carballo, \\"Del Precl√°sico al Epicl√°sico en Tlaxcala\\", in Arqueolog√≠a Mexicana, number 139, 2016. Xochitecatl lies 1 km west of, and within sight of, the contemporary Classic Period site of Cacaxtla, distinguished by its famous painted murals in Maya style. Xochitecatl is located 500m north of the modern town of Xochitecatitla and the same distance to the southeast of Atoyatenco. HistoryPreclassic Period= Around 800 BC, during the Middle Preclassic Period, the construction of Xochitecatl was begun with the construction of the Pyramid of Flowers, the Spiral Building and the Serpent Building. In the period from 550 BC to 400 BC, further structures were added to these existing buildings. By the period spanning 350 BC to 100 AD, Xochitecatl had become the centre of a powerful chiefdom exercising control over a large portion of western Tlaxcala. From 200 BC to 150 BC the Pyramid of Flowers was greatly expanded and further modifications took place at the Serpent Building. The site was abandoned in approximately 150 AD, after an eruption of Popocatepetl volcano. =Epiclassic (or Late Classic) Period= Between 600 AD and 950 AD Xochitecatl was reoccupied when parts of the site were reused as a secondary ceremonial centre within the extended urban area of Cacaxtla. The Platform of the Volcanoes was built and the Pyramid of Flowers became the centre of ritual activity including the sacrifice of children. About 950 AD both Xochitecatl and Cacaxtla were abandoned, although there is evidence of continued ritual activity in the Postclassic Period.Xochitecatl at INAH =Modern history= Major excavations were undertaken at the site in 1993-4 by Mari Carmen Serra Puche with the goal of exploring the principal structures around the site core. In the course of these investigations two obsidian workshops were uncovered; in the Pyramid of Flowers (Building E1) and the Serpent Building (Building E2). Site description The ceremonial centre of Xochitecatl lies around two plazas surrounded by the principle structures. Around the main plaza are located the Pyramid of Flowers, the Serpent Building and the Platform of the Volcanoes. The western plaza is bordered by the Spiral Building. =The Pyramid of Flowers= (Pir√°mide de las Flores in Spanish, designated as Building E1) Xochit√©catl Pir√°mide de las Flores This structure was built during the Preclassic Period but shows evidence of use right up to the Spanish Colonial Period. The base of the pyramid measures 100 meters by 140 meters, a similar size to that of the Pyramid of the Moon in Teotihuacan. Inside were found the burials of more than 30 children and one adult accompanied by offerings. Beads of green stone were deposited in the mouths of some of the children in order to accompany them on their journey to the underworld. Xochit√©catl clay figurine Upon the stairway giving access to the upper part of the building were deposited offerings that included more than 2000 clay figurines and 15 stone sculptures representing both humans and animals. The distinguishing feature of the figurines is the great quantity of figures that represent females from infancy right through to old age, including babies, richly-dressed women and pregnant women. Some figurines represent women with an opening in the abdomen containing richly dressed babies. Others show mothers carrying their children in their arms or upon their backs. The figurines are richly detailed, giving a glimpse of the daily attire in pre-Columbian times. Some of the women represented are wearing pleated skirts or skirts decorated with geometric designs such as lines, stripes, circles and dots; some figurines wear blouses (quezquemetl) which are similarly decorated. Some of the women wear coloured bows in their hair while others are adorned with four- or five-petalled flowers. A stairway ascends the pyramid, before it stand two large monolithic basins, one measuring 1.7 meters in diameter. Four sculptures were found deposited in the larger basin; a sculpture of a toad, a sculpture of a mythological serpent disgorging a human face from its open jaws and two sculptures of human faces. During excavations on the Pyramid of Flowers, more than two hundred grey, black and green obsidian projectile points were recovered, together with hundreds of fragments of the same stone. More than twenty stone sculptures were also recovered, the majority of which were mutilated; these include animal sculptures such as a canine, an amphibian and a monkey; there are also anthropomorphic and mythological sculptures, such as a sculpture that represents a fleshless human face with the body of a rattlesnake and has been linked by investigators with local folklore of the goddess Xochitl, who takes the form of a beautiful woman but who can transform into a snake. Each year on 29 September the sun rises directly from the mouth of the La Malinche volcano, as seen from the summit of the Pyramid of Flowers. This date coincides with the annual festival at nearby San Miguel el Milagro, just under 2 km away to the east. =The Serpent Building= (Edificio de la Serpiente in Spanish, designated as Building E2) This building dates from around 700 BC (in the Preclassic Period) and measures 80 meters by 50 meters. A monolithic stone basin measuring 1.3 meters across and 60 cm high is found on top of the structure. A mutilated stela was deposited inside, bearing the carving of a snake's fangs and forked tongue. To the north of this were found two stone sculptures; one of a man dressed as a jaguar and the other of a man with pronounced forehead and lips holding a sceptre or staff in his right hand. A room was built at ground level against the west side of the Serpent Building. Large amounts of worked obsidian were found in the northeast corner of this building, indicating that it was probably used as a workshop. Items found include cores, stone chippings, knives, projectile points and scrapers as well as bone tools and antlers. Associated ceramic remains were used to date these finds to the Late Preclassic (350 BC ‚Äì 100 AD). Originally the Serpent Building was a square structure with the only means of access being a stairway on the north side. Later the building was expanded to the east with the addition of another platform. At the same time the north stairway was blocked off and a new stairway was built using tepetate covered with mud. =The Spiral Building= (Edificio de la Espiral in Spanish, designated as Building E3) This circular stepped pyramid lies on the western side of the ceremonial centre and was built around 700 BC, in the Preclassic Period. Due to its location on the hillside the western side of the pyramid has more levels than the eastern side. No trace of internal structures was found during excavation, the interior of the structure consisting of volcanic ash. The building has no stairway giving access to the top, it was climbed by following the spiral form of the building itself. A Christian cross was placed on top of the structure in 1632 AD, about 90 years after the Spanish Conquest, and remains in place to this day. Two burials were found in the structure, which was probably a temple to Ehecatl, the god of wind. =The Platform of the Volcanoes= (Basamento de los Volcanes in Spanish, designated as Building E4) This structure lies in the middle of the central plaza and is oriented north-south. The building measures 50 meters along its north-south axis and is 35 meters wide. Construction began in the Middle Preclassic, the building was then reused during the Classic Period, thus producing two phases of architecture. More than two hundred figurines representing the female form were recovered from this structure during the 1960s by German archaeologist Bodo Spranz. Of particular interest was a figurine representing a flayed female and identified as the goddess Tlazolteotl. The earliest phase of construction, including the east and west stairways, is built from tepetate overlaid with mud. The second phase reused the earlier stone walls, which were then covered with stucco. As at Teotihuacan, this building deviates 16 degrees from magnetic north, this is particularly evident with the earlier construction phase. A looted offering consistent with the interment of the remains of human infants was found in the upper part of this platform.

His uncles were the bishops William Knox and Edmund Knox, his niece was the writer Kathleen Knox. Educated at Trinity College, Dublin, he took the degree of Bachelor of Arts at the age of twenty-one,Archbishop Robert Knox Obituary in New York Times 24 October 1893 (attached to article DEMOCRATS SUPPORT SCHIEREN) (pdf file) then graduated MA in 1834. He was also awarded the degree of Doctor of Laws by Cambridge in 1888. Career In 1832, Knox was ordained deacon and priest by Bishop Beresford of Kilmore. On 7 May 1834 he became chancellor of Ardfert. On 16 October 1841 he was collated as prebendary of St Munchin's, Limerick, by his uncle Edmund Knox, Bishop of Limerick, who also made him his domestic chaplain. In 1849 he became a Doctor of Divinity and was appointed Bishop of Down, Connor and Dromore. In 1886, he was created Archbishop of Armagh. He was succeeded in Down, Connor and Dromore by William Reeves. Knox was nominated to the see of Down, Connor, and Dromore by George Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon, at the time Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. Samuel Wilberforce later reported in his diary for 26 August 1861, some gossip about this appointment; James Henthorn Todd had said of Knox that he was \\"‚Ä¶very foolish, without learning, piety, judgment, conduct, sense, appointed by a job, that his uncle should resign Limerick\\", while Anthony La Touche Kirwan (Dean of Limerick, died 1868), said that Knox \\"‚Ä¶used, when made to preach by his uncle, to get me to write his sermon, and could not deliver it\\".Wilberforce, R. G., Life of the right reverend Samuel Wilberforce‚Ä¶ with selections from his diaries and correspondence (1882), vol. 3, p. 25. Nevertheless, Knox was the author of various ecclesiastical and secular works. Knox made no secret of his view that disestablishment in Ireland was inevitable. As Bishop of Down, Connor, and Dromore, he hoped to build a new cathedral in Belfast, but abandoned this plan in favour of another, to increase the number of churches of the united diocese. He founded the Belfast Church Extension Society in 1862 and through it achieved forty-eight new or enlarged churches. He organized diocesan conferences and founded a Diocesan Board of Missions. In 1867, in the House of Lords, he proposed a reduction of the hierarchy of the Church of Ireland to just one archbishop and five bishops. In person, he was quiet and restrained, pragmatic and frank, and an able administrator and an effective speaker. Following the death of Marcus Gervais Beresford, Archbishop of Armagh, on 26 December 1885, Knox was chosen as his successor. As president of the General Synod of the Irish church he was seen as fair and moderate. He died at the archbishop's palace, Armagh, on 23 October 1893, and was buried on 27 October in the old ruined church at Holywood. There is also a memorial to him in the north aisle at St Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh.\\"Funary Monuments & Memorials in St Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh\\" Curl, J.S. pp52-53: Whitstable; Historical Publications; 2013 Family On 5 October 1842, Knox married Catherine Delia FitzGibbon, daughter of Thomas Gibbon FitzGibbon of Ballyseeda, County Limerick.

This village is at a distance of 7.3 km north of Urlabari  Houses  The houses are made of different combinations of materials ranging from bamboo, cement, mud, wood, bricks and stones. They are mostly supported by wooden pillars, and the roofs are made of galvanised iron. All houses in rural areas and most in urban have gardens where different fruits, vegetables and trees are planted. There are many chautaris near the roads for people to rest. Tube well is the main source of water for household activities. Each house generally has a tube well though many houses may share one too. Firewood is the main source of fuel. Electricity has reached most parts of the village and is widely used.  Economy  The economy is largely based on agriculture like most of the part of Nepal. The villagers bring their agricultural items grown in home to sell them directly or through vendors. There are no large-scale industries in the village though some small and medium scale are prevalent which are limited to bread factories, mills producing agro ‚Äì products. Madhumalla depends upon Urlabari and Damak for most daily items necessary though some traders also go to India for trade. After the Rabi-Urlabari road is black topped, it is assumed the economic activity will take a surge.  Education  The literacy rate was 75.43% as of 2011 census. There are 16 governmental schools educating the future of Madhumalla. Among them only Manohar and Bhagwati are higher secondary schools.  Health  There is a governmental health post and one hospital, Sajha Hospital. There are about half dozen pharmacy.  Transportation  Buses are the chief means of transportation in Madhumalla. One can reach there from Biratnagar airport to Madhumalla by bus directly. Buses from major cities like Kakarvitta, Dharan, Kathmandu also leave from there. Shree Hari Om pashupati which travel urlabari - toribari is the oldest and very popular bus among locals.A few rickshaws are also available from bus stop. With the recently black topped roads and improved economy motorcycles, cars are getting popular among the rich ones.  Tourism  Exploring the Mawa Nunsari forest, Khuddi picnic spot are major places of tourist attractions. Recently inaugurated suspension bridge at Kuinetaar, Toribari has shown some promising future in the tourism sector of Madhumalla. About hundred picnic groups visit this picnic spot every year. According to locals, the business in shops and fast food restaurants has increased rapidly following the bridge inauguration.  Sports  Football is the most popular sport. Regional, local and school level games are often held.  Security  Without a police station for several years, Madhumalla went to a state of anarchy. The number of thugs, robbers, murderers increased enormously. The widening political division and proper programmes have done anything but help in this transitional phase. During the Maoist conflict, the VDC office was burnt and destroyed. Many people were kidnapped, tortured during this period.The police station was restored after the Maoist conflict ended.  Problems  Politics is an important factor affecting the people in everyday life.Like the rest of the country, politics is badly affecting the educational,service sector and the overall development of Madhumalla. Majority of youths are in the gulf countries working as low skilled labourers. Too many local politicians who are without any leadership capabilities have been elected in the recent local level election from whom very little development can be anticipated. The importance of higher education is less emphasized and about 80% of girls get married upon completion of grade 12 Examination. Most of the boys go abroad as foreign workers by the age 20 or less. With recently blacktopped road connecting it to Urlabari, a ray of hope can be seen that it could grow into an emergent city within the next decade.

Early life  Murphy was born in England while his parents, Dr. John J. and Elsie (Kenway) Murphy were posted to London. John Murphy co-founded St. Clare's Mercy Hospital and died while Noel was a child. Murphy's great grandfather was the captain of a steam sailing ship while his grandfather, \\"Gambo Jack\\" Murphy founded St. John's radio station VONF in 1932. Murphy was educated at St. Bonaventure College in St. John's and at Ampleforth College in England. He studied electrical engineering for six months at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before deciding to change fields. He moved to Britain and earned his medical degree in 1942 from London Hospital. He joined the RAF Volunteer Reserve and was assigned to 125 (Newfoundland) Squadron serving as its medical officer until 1945 and reaching the rank of flight-lieutenant surgeon.  Return to Newfoundland  In 1945, he returned to Newfoundland to run a Bonne Bay Cottage Hospital in Norris Point on the western coast of Newfoundland. He was the only doctor on staff and handled all medical duties at the remote hospital for ten years. To reach remote communities in the hospital's catchment area during the winter, Dr. Murphy travelled by horse and sleigh or dog team before the federal government provided him with a snowmobile. In the summer, he performed his rounds via aircraft and boat. Dr. Murphy left the hospital in 1954 in order to take up private practice in Corner Brook specializing in obstetrics and gynecology.  Broadcasting  In 1959, Murphy helped found the Humber Valley Broadcasting Company becoming the new corporation's president. The company opened a radio station in Corner Brook in 1960 and had 10 stations by 1975. Murphy hosted a Christmas morning show for 47 years on the stations in which he phoned Newfoundlanders abroad and contacted communities named Newfoundland.  Political career  He entered politics on behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party of Newfoundland and Labrador and won the seat of Humber East in the 1962 provincial election. In 1966 he became party leader and Leader of the Opposition leading the Tories into the 1966 general election. The party lost four of its seven seats and Murphy was defeated in Humber East by Liberal Clyde Wells, a future premier. Murphy was elected mayor of Corner Brook for three terms and was unexpectedly appointed minister without portfolio in 1971 in the final cabinet of Liberal Premier Joey Smallwood however he lost the riding of Humber West in the subsequent 1971 provincial election to Conservative leader Frank Moores who would succeed Smallwood as Premier. In 1978, Murphy was again elected mayor of Corner Brook.  Hobbies  In his spare time, Murphy was an amateur photographer and was published the monthly Newfoundland Magazine. In 2003 he published a book, entitled Cottage Hospital Doctor, about his experiences at Bonne Bay.  Honours  Murphy's awards include an honorary doctorate in law from the Memorial University of Newfoundland (1975), Canadian Broadcaster of the Year (1984), and the Order of Canada (1988).

DJC2 is produced and fielded by the U.S. military to support Joint warfare. The DJC2 Joint Program Office developed the system, and it is integrated and produced by a U.S. Government integrator, the Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division. The base DJC2 system consists of a linked group of self-powered and climate-controlled tents which house computer network servers, computer workstations with furniture, satellite communications equipment, voice and data encryption equipment, a video teleconferencing system, video display screens, printers, fax machines, etc. Utilizing a fielded DJC2 system, the commander and his staff can securely communicate across the world, send and receive information across five different computer networks (including secure networks and the Internet), participate in video teleconferences with remote locations, and use a fully integrated command and control/collaboration software tool suite to plan and execute missions. In addition to the base system, DJC2 includes some additional specialized configurations designed to support a commander's need for command and control capabilities in specialized circumstances. These configurations include: a \\"suitcase\\" communications suite which can be hand- carried and used on short notice by a first responder/small control team; and a small, air-certified headquarters suite which can operate aboard a military aircraft while in flight. The DJC2 system also includes an experimental concept demonstration suite with DJC2 workstations installed in shipboard containers for operation aboard a ship while underway. Currently, the Department of Defense has produced and fielded six fully deployable DJC2 systems to commands in the United States and Europe. A DJC2 system was used in a Joint Task Force effort supporting the relief efforts in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, Louisiana, as well as more recently in the Joint Task Force providing humanitarian assistance and disaster relief to Cyclone Nargis victims in Myanmar (Burma). The DJC2 systems have also been used in military exercises around the world, including the United States, Europe, Africa, Central America, and Asia. DesignSubsystems= The DJC2 design provides the capabilities of its four configurations by integrating components from three different subsystems: * Infrastructure Support (IS) ‚Äì Includes such components as climate-controlled tents; generators for power; environmental control units for heating/cooling; furniture for workstations; framework for mounting tools such as large video display screens; lighting, etc. * Information Technology (IT) ‚Äì Includes such components as laptop workstations with network connectivity and desktop peripherals; five different networks (including a combination of secure and non-secure) with supporting computer servers; command and control software applications, including the Department of Defense's standardized command and control suite, Global Command and Control ‚Äì Joint (GCCS-J); collaboration software applications, an online portal which provides access to software applications and data; voice communications; video display technology with large screen displays; video teleconferencing; cryptographic components and other information assurance (security) tools, etc. * Communications ‚Äì Includes such components as satellite dishes, radios, communications interfaces, etc. =Architecture= The DJC2 command and control architecture is an open architecture based on Service Oriented Architecture principles. The architecture utilizes several technologies ‚Äì including Internet Protocol Convergence (IPC) and virtualization ‚Äì to reconcile the DJC2 system's robust IT requirements (i.e., five different networks, C2 and collaboration software applications, and communications) with its stringent deployability and rapid set-up requirements. The DJC2 system's IPC Suite uses IPC technology to provide IP-based services and flexible bandwidth utilization. The system uses virtualization technology in both hardware (computer servers) and software. Virtualization of the DJC2 hardware allows one DJC2 computer server to do the job of multiple servers by creating \\"virtual machines\\" (VMs) that can run their own operating systems and applications just like a \\"real\\" server, and then can be hosted with many other VMs on one physical server to more effectively utilize computer server capacity. Virtualization of the DJC2 software allows for better portability of applications to differing hardware sets. Through virtualization, the DJC2 program reduced the size of its system (e.g., reducing the number of servers per network from an original nine to three plus one spare), which decreases both the amount of space required for the system to be set up (footprint) and the transportation assets needed to transport it (lift), as well as decreased cost and set-up time. =Refresh= The DJC2 program is currently in its Technology Refresh and Technology Insertion phase, which will include inserting such technologies as Secure Wireless Networking into the existing DJC2 systems. Configurations The DJC2 system includes four distinct DJC2 configurations, each designed to meet different mission needs ranging from the mission of a two-person first responder team up to the mission of a major Joint Task Force. =Core= The baseline configuration of the DJC2 system is the Core configuration, which enables a commander to rapidly deploy a fully capable temporary command and control headquarters. The Core is a 60-operator suite housed in tents which can be set up and fully operational with communications and network connectivity in less than 24 hours after arrival on-site. Each operator workstation includes two laptops to provide an operator with simultaneous access to two networks, and telephone and intercom capability. The Core is flexible and scalable, and can be tailored to an individual mission (i.e., a commander can take only what he needs for a particular mission and leave the rest behind). The DJC2 Core can support a small Joint Task Force, or can be combined with other Cores to support a larger Joint Task Force. Though the Core provides physical space and workstations for 60 operator workstations, its computer servers can support more than 750 simultaneous users, so additional non-DJC2 computers can be connected to the DJC2 system when needed. Though the Core has organic communications capabilities, establishing a full Core requires supplemental communications support at the site, such as that provided by a military communications unit. The Core has its own generators for power and environmental control units for heating/cooling. However, it can be connected to external power when available. It also can be set up inside an available building instead of the tents. =Early Entry= Embedded within the Core is the Early Entry configuration, which enables a commander to deploy an early (first 72‚Äì96 hours) command and control presence and develop situational awareness at a location prior to setting up a full temporary headquarters (when needed). The Early Entry configuration is a 20/40-operator suite, housed in just two of the Core's rectangular tents, which can be set up and providing limited communications and network connectivity within 4 ‚Äì 6 hours of arrival at a location. When the rest of the Core arrives, it can be quickly connected to the Early Entry components to provide full Core functionality within 24 hours. Like the Core, the Early Entry configuration has its own generators for power and environmental control units for heating/cooling, but can be connected to external power when available. It also can be set up inside an available building instead of the tents. =En Route= The En Route configuration is a stand-alone DJC2 suite which enables the commander to establish and sustain effective command and control and situational awareness while traveling by air from the garrison headquarters to a deployed location. It provides 6 ‚Äì 12 workstations, mounted to a special aircraft pallet, which allow operators to communicate, connect to two networks (one secure and one non-secure), and perform command and control functions while in flight on a C-130 or C-17 aircraft. Specially designed \\"roller carts\\" house the primary networking and communications equipment and at least one system administrator position to manage the network and communication interfaces. The En Route configuration can be marshaled from short-term storage and ready for aircraft installation within 3 hours of notification. The workstations are also operable on the ground, and onboard while the aircraft is on the flight line. The En Route configuration requires an external power source, such as power from the aircraft. =Rapid Response Kit= The Rapid Response Kit is a stand- alone DJC2 suite which enables a commander to deploy a lightweight communications package anywhere in the world at a moment's notice by a very small team carrying it on a military or commercial aircraft. The Rapid Response Kit supports 2 ‚Äì 15 operators. It has no computer servers; instead, it \\"reaches back\\" electronically to established U.S. Department of Defense networks via satellite connectivity. It provides two networks simultaneously, chosen from four network options, including both secure and non-secure networks. It is provides both voice and data communications, as well as a video teleconferencing capability. The Rapid Response Kit requires an external power source, such as commercial power from a building. It can also connect to other networks, such as a network in a commercial hotel. =Maritime Demonstrator= In partnership with the U.S. Navy Second Fleet, the DJC2 program has also produced and demonstrated a prototype configuration of a Joint Task Force headquarters afloat command and control capability, called the DJC2 Maritime Demonstrator. The demonstrator is a totally self-contained Joint Task Force Headquarters suite which can be installed aboard a ship. It requires nothing from the ship other than physical space, electrical power, and hotel services for the command staff. The demonstrator (which is a repackaging of the DJC2 architecture) consists of a group of climate- controlled ISO containers of two types: Staff Modules, which house 10 operator workstations per container; and Tech Control Modules, which house the networking, communications, and video distribution hardware that supports the operators. The ISO containers are secured for sea using normal ship's tie-down points in any appropriate open space. The design also includes satellite communication antennas for connectivity to DISA's Global Information Grid. This connectivity may also be provided via the ship's organic satellite communications system. The demonstrator, which has been successfully tested, can easily be scaled larger when the mission requires it by adding more ISO containers of each type. In addition, the C2 architecture is sufficiently robust to support a large number of additional external users in other ship spaces (e.g., embarked unit spaces). The demonstrator can be installed on a designated ship of opportunity ‚Äì including Navy, Military Sealift Command, Maritime Pre-Positioning Force Units, Coalition Force ships ‚Äì or ashore. Since it is self-contained and easy to install/uninstall, it can be moved as needed among ships and installed wherever space and power are available.  Users  The DJC2 system is fielded to U.S. Combatant Commands and/or their component commands for their use in standing up Joint Task Forces in response to military and humanitarian crises. Currently, the commands that own a DJC2 system include: U.S. Southern Command; U.S. Pacific Command; U.S. European Command; Southern European Task Force/U.S. Army Africa; U.S. Army South, and III Marine Expeditionary Force. The DJC2 system's command and control capabilities also have utility for non-military applications such as supporting Homeland Security efforts responding to natural disasters. As noted, DJC2 was used in a Joint Task Force supporting the rescue and relief effort in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina on the U.S. Gulf Coast and of Cyclone Nargis in Myanmar (Burma). = Certifications = The DJC2 system is a fully tested, fully certified U.S. military system.

The National Health Service in England was created by the National Health Service Act 1946. Responsibility for the NHS in Wales was passed to the Secretary of State for Wales in 1969, leaving the Secretary of State for Social Services responsible for the NHS in England by itself. Development of the NHS in England and Wales, 1948‚Äì1969 The original structure of the NHS in England and Wales had three aspects, known as the tripartite system: * Hospital services: Fourteen regional hospital boards were created in England and Wales to administer the majority of hospital services. Beneath these were 400 hospital management committees which administered hospitals. Teaching hospitals had different arrangements and were organised under boards of governors. * Primary care: GPs were independent contractors (that is, they were not salaried employees) and would be paid for each person on their list. Dentists, opticians and pharmacists also generally provided services as independent contractors. Executive councils were formed and administered contracts and payments to the contractor professions as well as maintaining lists of local practitioners and dealing with patients. * Community services: Maternity and child welfare clinics, health visitors, midwives, health education, vaccination & immunisation and ambulance services together with environmental health services were the responsibility of local authorities. This was a continuation of the role local government had held under the Poor Laws. In 1948 across England and Wales there were 377 hospital management committees, and 36 teaching hospitals, each with its own board of governors. There were also 146 local health authorities, running health centres, ambulances services and other community services, and 140 executive councils, managing general practices, NHS dentistry, pharmacists and opticians. The new service instantly became Britain's third largest employer with around 364,000 staff across England and Wales. These included 9,000 full-time doctors, 19,000 professional and technical staff (including 2,800 physiotherapists, 1,600 laboratory technicians and 2,000 radiographers), 25,000 administrative and clerical staff, 149,000 nurses and midwives (23,000 of whom were part-time), and 128,000 ancillary staff (catering, laundry, cleaning and maintenance).Report of the Ministry of Health for the Year Ended 31 December 1952 (London: HMSO, 1953), pp. 129‚Äì130 By the beginning of the 1950s, spending on the NHS was exceeding expectations, leading in 1952 to the introduction of a one-shilling charge for prescriptions and a ¬£1 charge for dental treatment; these were exceptions to the NHS being free at the point of use. Political concerns about spiralling NHS costs later receded in the wake of the 1956 Guillebaud Report, which praised the \\"responsible attitude among hospital authorities\\" towards the \\"efficient and economical\\" use of public funds. The 1950s saw the planning of hospital services, dealing in part with some of the gaps and duplications that existed across England and Wales. The period also saw growth in the number of medical staff and a more even distribution of them with the development of hospital outpatient services. By 1956, the NHS was stretched financially and doctors were disaffected, resulting in a Royal Commission on doctors' pay being set up in February 1957. The investigation and trial of alleged serial killer Dr John Bodkin Adams exposed some of the tensions in the system. Indeed, if he had been found guilty (for, in the eyes of doctors, accidentally killing a patient while providing treatment) and hanged, the whole NHS might have collapsed.Pamela V. Cullen, \\"A Stranger in Blood: The Case Files on Dr John Bodkin Adams\\", London, Elliott & Thompson, 2006, The Mental Health Act 1959 also significantly altered legislation in respect of mental illness and reduced the grounds on which someone could be detained in a mental hospital. The 1960s have been characterised as a period of growth. Prescription charges were abolished in 1965 and reintroduced in 1968. New drugs came to the market improving healthcare, including polio vaccine, dialysis for chronic kidney failure and chemotherapy for certain cancers were developed, all adding to upfront costs. Health Secretary Enoch Powell undertook three initiatives: * The Hospital Plan published in 1962 proposed the development of district general hospitals for population areas of about 125,000 and laid out a pattern for the future district by district; * The Church House speech predicted that many of the large mental health institutions would close within ten years. Concern continued to grow about the structure of the NHS and weaknesses of the tripartite system. Powell agreed to the creation of a Royal Commission on doctors‚Äô pay, which resulted in a statutory review body. Further development came in the form of the Charter of General Practice, negotiated between new Health Minister Kenneth Robinson and the BMA, that provided financial incentives for practice development. This resulted in the concept of the primary health care in better-housed and better-staffed practices, stimulating doctors to join together and the development of the modern group practice. In 1969, responsibility for the NHS in Wales was passed to the Secretary of State for Wales from the Secretary of State for Health who was thereafter just responsible for the NHS in England. After the publication by the British Medical Journal on 24 December 1949 of University of Cambridge consultant paediatrician Douglas Gairdner's landmark paper detailing the lack of medical benefit and the risks attached to non- therapeutic (routine) circumcision, the National Health Service took a decision that circumcision would not be performed unless there was a clear and present medical indication. Both the cost and the non-therapeutic, unnecessary, harmful nature of the surgical operation were taken into account.  1970s and early 1980s  The NHS in England was reorganised in 1974 to bring together services provided by hospitals and services provided by local authorities under the umbrella of regional health authorities, with a further restructuring in 1982. The 1970s also saw the end of the economic optimism which had characterised the 1960s and increasing pressures coming to bear to reduce the amount of money spent on public services and to ensure increased efficiency for the money spent. The 1970s and 1980s saw issues with contaminated blood and blood products which was referred to later as the \\"worst treatment disaster in the history of the NHS\\".  Thatcher government reforms  In the 1980s, Thatcherism represented a systematic, decisive rejection and reversal of the Post-war consensus, whereby the major political parties largely agreed on the central themes of Keynesianism, the welfare state, nationalised industry, public housing and close regulation of the economy. There was one major exception: the National Health Service, which was widely popular and had wide support inside the Conservative Party. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher promised Britons in 1982, the NHS is \\"safe in our hands.\\"Rudolf Klein, \\"Why Britain's conservatives support a socialist health care system.\\" Health Affairs 4#1 (1985): 41‚Äì58. online In the 1980s modern management processes (General Management) were introduced in the NHS to replace the previous system of consensus management. This was outlined in the Griffiths Report of 1983. This recommended the appointment of general managers in the NHS with whom responsibility should lie. The report also recommended that clinicians be better involved in management. Financial pressures continued to place strain on the NHS. In 1987, an additional ¬£101 million was provided by the government to the NHS. In 1988 the then Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, announced a review of the NHS. From this review and in 1989, two white papers Working for Patients and Caring for People were produced. These outlined the introduction of what was termed the \\"internal market\\", which was to shape the structure and organisation of health services for most of the next decade. In spite of intensive opposition from the BMA, who wanted a pilot study or the reforms in one region, the internal market was introduced. In 1990, the National Health Service & Community Care Act (in England) defined this \\"internal market\\", whereby Health Authorities ceased to run hospitals but \\"purchased\\" care from their own or other authorities' hospitals. Certain GPs became \\"fund holders\\" and were able to purchase care for their patients. The \\"providers\\" became NHS trusts, which encouraged competition but also increased local differences. Studies suggest that while the competition introduced in the \\"internal market\\" system resulted in shorter waiting times it also caused a reduction in the quality of care for patients.  Blair government reforms  These innovations, especially the \\"fund holder\\" option, were condemned at the time by the Labour Party. Opposition to what was claimed to be a Conservative intention to privatise the NHS became a major feature of Labour's election campaigns. Labour came to power in 1997 with the promise to remove the \\"internal market\\" and abolish fundholding. In a speech given by the new Prime Minister, Tony Blair, at the Lonsdale Medical Centre on 9 December 1997, he stated that: However, in his second term Blair pursued measures to strengthen the internal market as part of his plan to \\"modernise\\" the NHS. Driving these reforms were a number of factors including the rising costs of medical technology and medicines, the desire to increase standards and \\"patient choice\\", an ageing population, and a desire to contain government expenditure. Since the national health services in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are not controlled by the UK government, these reforms have increased the differences between the national health services in different parts of the United Kingdom. (See NHS Wales and NHS Scotland for descriptions of their developments). Reforms included (amongst other actions) the laying down of detailed service standards, strict financial budgeting, revised job specifications, reintroduction of a modified form of fundholding ‚Äì \\"practice- based commissioning\\", closure of surplus facilities and emphasis on rigorous clinical and corporate governance. In addition Modernising Medical Careers medical training had an unsuccessful restructuring which was so badly managed that the Secretary of State for Health was forced to apologise publicly. It was then revised but its flawed implementation left the NHS with significant medical staffing problems. Some new services were developed to help manage demand, including NHS Direct. A new emphasis was given to staff reforms, with the Agenda for Change agreement providing harmonised pay and career progression. These changes gave rise to controversy within the medical professions, the media and the public. The Blair Government, whilst leaving services free at point of use, encouraged outsourcing of medical services and support to the private sector. Under the Private Finance Initiative, an increasing number of hospitals were built (or rebuilt) by private sector consortia; hospitals may have both medical services (such as independent sector treatment centre (ISTC or \\"surgicentres\\"), and non-medical services (such as catering) provided under long-term contracts by the private sector. A study by a consultancy company which worked for the Department of Health showed that every ¬£200 million spent on privately financed hospitals resulted in the loss of 1000 doctors and nurses. The first PFI hospitals contained some 28 per cent fewer beds than the ones they replaced. In 2005, surgicentres treated around three per cent of NHS patients (in England) having routine surgery. By 2008 this was expected to be around 10 per cent. NHS primary care trusts have been given the target of sourcing at least 15 per cent of primary care from the private or voluntary sectors over the medium term. As a corollary to these initiatives, the NHS was required to take on pro-active socially \\"directive\\" policies, for example, in respect of smoking and obesity. The NHS encountered significant problems with the information technology (IT) innovations accompanying the Blair reforms. The NHS's National Programme for IT (NPfIT), believed to be the largest IT project in the world, is running significantly behind schedule and above budget, with friction between the government and the programme contractors. Originally budgeted at ¬£2.3 billion, present estimates are ¬£20‚Äì30 billion and rising. There has also been criticism of a lack of patient information security. The ability to deliver integrated high quality services will require care professionals to use sensitive medical data. This must be controlled and in the NPfIT model it is, sometimes too tightly to allow the best care to be delivered. One concern is that GPs and hospital doctors have given the project a lukewarm reception, citing a lack of consultation and complexity. Key \\"front-end\\" parts of the programme include Choose and Book, intended to assist patient choice of location for treatment, which has missed numerous deadlines for going \\"live\\", substantially overrun its original budget, and is still (May 2006) available in only a few locations. The programme to computerise all NHS patient records is also experiencing great difficulties. Furthermore, there are unresolved financial and managerial issues on training NHS staff to introduce and maintain these systems once they are operative. Between 2004/5 and 2013/4 NHS output increased considerably. Hospital admissions increased by 32%, outpatient attendances by 17%, primary care consultations by 25% and community care activity by 14%. Hospital death rates reduced, especially in stroke. At the same time there was an increase in wages of 24% and an increase of 10% in the number of staff and increases in the use of equipment and supplies. As a whole NHS output increased by 47% and inputs by 31%, an increase in productivity of 12.86% during the period, or 1.37% per year. Coalition and Cameron government reforms Royal College of Midwives Picketing the West Middlesex Hospital, Isleworth. Thousands of other NHS staff across England also staged a four-hour strike over pay on 13 October 2014. The return of a Conservative-led government in 2010 coincided with another deterioration in industrial relations. The introduction of further private sector involvement in the Health and Social Care Act 2012 provoked mass demonstrations led by health workers, and some NHS workers also participated in a national strike over pay restraint in 2014. 2016 also saw major industrial action by junior doctors, protesting at the imposition of a new contract aiming to extend weekend working. The Health and Social Care Act 2012 did not extend patient choice as envisaged (as this policy subsequently took a backseat) but did lead to an increasing amount of the NHS budget being diverted to private providers. In 2019, doctors and MPs warned that the ongoing privatisation of certain NHS England cancer screening services would lead to patient harm. In July 2019, it was announced that the NHS would be partnering with the virtual assistant Amazon Alexa to offer health advice directly from the NHS website.

He later became the subject of a children's book and the film The Mudlark. The full story of his activities has been told in the 2010 book Queen Victoria's Stalker: The Strange Case of the Boy Jones, written by Jan Bondeson. BiographyEarly life= Buckingham Palace c. 1837 with the Marble Arch in its original position. Edward Jones was the son of a tailor in Westminster. =Arrests= In 1838, aged approximately 14, Jones entered Buckingham Palace disguised as a chimney sweep. He was caught by a porter in the Marble Hall and, after a chase, captured by the police in St James's Street, with Queen Victoria's underwear stuffed down his trousers., citing Dr Jan Bondeson's 2010 book Queen Victoria's Stalker: The Strange Case of the Boy Jones () He was brought before Queen Square Police Court on 14 December. It turned out that he had frequently mentioned his intention to enter the palace to his employer, a builder. Although he had apparently stolen linen and a regimental sword from the palace, he was acquitted by the jury. On 30 November 1840, nine days after the birth of Queen Victoria's first child, Princess Victoria, he \\"scaled the wall of Buckingham Palace about half-way up Constitution Hill\\", entered the palace, and left undetected. On 1 December 1840, he broke in again. Shortly after midnight, Baroness Lehzen discovered him under a sofa in the Queen's dressing room and he was arrested. His father's plea of insanity being without success, he was sentenced to three months in a house of correction. The 1840 incident caused a stir because initially, it was feared that it might affect the Queen, happening so shortly after childbirth. Before his release from Tothill Fields Prison on 2 March 1841, attempts were made to persuade Jones to join the Navy. On 15 March 1841, after a snack in one of the royal apartments, \\"the boy Jones\\" was caught by the reinforced police force guarding the palace. This time, he was sentenced to three months' hard labour. This third incident caused a furore, and three additional palace guards were appointed. =Later life= After his second release, he refused an offer of ¬£4 a week (¬£ today) to appear in a music hall, and a short time later, he was caught loitering in the vicinity of Buckingham Palace.Strachey, Lytton (1921) Queen Victoria. He was sent to do duty in the Navy and consequently served on several Navy ships, including HMS Warspite, HMS Inconstant, and '. After a year, he found an opportunity to walk from Portsmouth to London. Having been caught before he reached the palace, he was sent back to his ship. He was last mentioned in the newspapers in 1844, when he was rescued after going overboard between Tunis and Algiers. Jones became an alcoholic and a burglar, and later went to Australia, where he became the town crier of Perth. Memorial plaque of Edward Jones In the 1880s, Edward Jones adopted the name \\"Thomas Jones\\" in a vain attempt to escape his unwanted notoriety. He died on Boxing Day 1893 in Bairnsdale, Australia, after falling off the parapet of the east side of the Mitchell River bridge while drunk and landing on his head. He is buried at the Bairnsdale Cemetery in an unmarked grave. His memorial plaque says that he entered Windsor Castle, while all evidence says that it was Buckingham Palace that he entered.

It was originally described simply as \\"brain hormone\\" by early workers such as Stefan Kopeƒá (1922) and Vincent Wigglesworth (1934), who realized that ligation of the head of immature insects could prevent molting or pupation of the body region excluded from the head if the ligation was performed before a critical age in the lifestage was reached. After a certain point the ligation had no effect and both sections of the insect would molt or pupate. However, implantation of a conspecific brain to a sessile ligated abdomen or an abdomen under diapause would induce molting or pupation. Thus, the brain was originally thought to be the source of the hormone that induces molting in insects. Later it was established that the insect brain produces a number of hormones, but the hormone which was the cause of the observations made by Kopeƒá and Wigglesworth was prothoracicotropic hormone. PTTH is secreted by a neurohemal organ, the corpus cardiacum (in some insects the corpus allatum secretes PTTH) which is actually a discrete structure posterior to the brain. PTTH is released in response to environmental stimuli and as its name implies PTTH acts on the prothoracic glands, which respond by releasing molting hormone (an ecdysteroid) into the haemolymph. Molting hormone stimulates the molting process.Chapman, R.F. 1998. The Insects: Structure and Function. 4th edition, Cambridge University Press.Klowden, M.J. 2007.

A minor upon his father's death in 1636, his uncle Duke Adolph Frederick I of Mecklenburg- Schwerin at first became regent at G√ºstrow, fiercely opposed by Gustav Adolph's mother. In 1654 he came of age and married Magdalene Sibylle, a daughter of Duke Frederick III of Holstein-Gottorp. Their marriage produced eleven children: * Johann, Hereditary Prince of Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow (2 December 1655 - 6 February 1660). * Eleonore (1 June 1657 - 24 February 1672). * Marie (June 19, 1659 - 6 January 1701), married on 23 September 1684 to Duke Adolph Frederick II of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. * Magdalene (5 July 1660 - 19 February 1702). * Sophie (21 June 1662 - 1 June 1738), married on 6 December 1700 to Duke Christian Ulrich I of W√ºrttemberg-Oels. * Christine (14 August 1663 - 3 August 1749), married on 4 May 1683 to Louis Christian, Count of Stolberg-Gedern. * Charles, Hereditary Prince of Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow (18 November 1664 - 15 March 1688), married on 10 August 1687 to Marie Amalie of Brandenburg, a daughter of Elector Frederick William. * Hedwig (12 January 1666 - 9 August 1735), married on 1 December 1686 to Duke August of Saxe- Merseburg-Z√∂rbig. * Louise (28 August 1667 - 15 March 1721), married on 5 December 1696 to King Frederick IV of Denmark. * Elisabeth (3 September 1668 - 25 August 1738), married on 29 March 1692 to Duke Henry of Saxe-Merseburg- Spremberg. * Augusta (27 December 1674 - 19 May 1756). The death of the only surviving son, the Hereditary Prince Charles, in 1688 at the age of 23, caused a succession crisis in Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow. Gustav Adolph's daughter Marie married her cousin Adolphus Frederick II of Mecklenburg, who after the death of his father-in-law claimed the G√ºstrow heritage, but could not prevail against the ruling duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. A younger daughter, Louise in 1695 married the Danish crown prince Frederick IV and in 1699 became queen consort of Denmark. Gustav Adolph died in G√ºstrow at the age of 62.

Some paintings were also made in other Rocky Mountain states, the Pacific Northwest and Canada, and a few in Louisiana, the East Coast and Europe. Biography Adams was born in Franklin, Massachusetts; his family moved to Denver in 1876. In 1877 he began worked as an engrave in Denver, and received lessons from Helen Henderson Chain, an artist who had studied with George Inness. In 1885 he traveled to the East Coast and visited the studios of George Inness and Worthington Whittredge, and in 1888 he traveled to California and visited the studios of William Keith and Thomas Hill. He traveled to Louisiana in 1890, and to Europe in the summer of 1914. He spent the winter of 1916 in California, and moved to Los Angeles in 1920, and built a second home in Laguna Beach in 1926. He died in Los Angeles. Art Adams is known for his views of snowy mountain peaks in early morning or sunset light, or wreathed in storm clouds, and for his luminous sunset and twilight paintings of the river bottoms near Denver. Most of Adams paintings are enhanced by the use of stronger colors than one would find in a photograph. The evening shadows are bluer, the spring grass is greener, the sunsets more strikingly yellow or orange. He sometimes used very small areas of intense blue and red to enliven a dark shadowed area such as the heart of a clump of willows or the dark base of an aspen tree. He also made the mountains look about twice as tall as they actually look, as if seen through a telephoto lens.

It was founded by the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1947 (since repealed by the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978) and was launched on 5 July 1948, under the control of the Secretary of State for Scotland. As a result of the Scotland Act 1998, control over NHS Scotland transferred to the Scottish Government and Parliament in 1999. Background \\"Your Health Service: How it will work in Scotland\\", 1948 Prior to the creation of Scotland's NHS in 1948, the state was involved with the provision of healthcare, though it was not universal. Half of Scotland's landmass was already covered by the Highlands and Islands Medical Service, a state-funded health system run directly from Edinburgh, which had been set up 35 years earlier. In addition, there had been a substantial state-funded hospital building programme during the war years. Scotland also had its own distinctive medical tradition, centred on its medical schools rather than private practice, and a detailed plan for the future of health provision based on the Cathcart report. Facilities were built during the Second World War that took hospital capacity to 30,000 beds. By June 1947, there were 112 centres that were part of the St Andrews and Red Cross service. The 1947 Act provided a uniform national structure for services which had previously been provided by a combination of the Highlands and Islands Medical Service, local government, charities and private organisations which in general was only free for emergency use. The new system was funded from central taxation and did not generally involve a charge at the time of use for services concerned with existing medical conditions or vaccinations carried out as a matter of general public health requirements. The NHS in Scotland was formed on 5 July 1948. Prescription charges The NHS (Amendment) Act 1949 was passed by a Labour government and allowed a prescription charge to be collected, although these fees were first introduced by a Conservative government in 1952. However, prescription charges in Scotland were abolished by the Scottish Government on 1 April 2011, leaving England as the only country in the UK in which such charges still exist. Programmes In 1962 a ¬£70million programme of hospital modernisation was announced.

Water is used as a solution to dissolve the salt or halite deposits so that they can be extracted by pipe to an evaporation process, which results in a brine or dry product for sale or use. In the United States during the 19th century, salt wells were a significant source of income for operators and the government. Locating underground salt deposits was usually based on locations of existing salt springs. In mountainous areas, a similar technique called sink works (from German sinkwerk) is used. History The Chinese have been using brine wells and a form of salt solution mining as part of their civilization for more than 2000 years. The first recorded salt well in China was dug in the Sichuan province around 2,250 years ago. This was the first time that ancient water well technology was applied successfully for the exploitation of salt, and marked the beginning of Sichuan‚Äôs salt drilling industry. Shaft wells were sunk as early as 220 BC in the Sichuan and Yunnan Provinces. By 1035 AD, Chinese in the Sichuan area were using percussion drilling to recover deep brines, a technique that would not be introduced to the West for another 600 to 800 years. Medieval and modern European travelers to China between 1400 to 1700 AD reported salt and natural gas production from dense networks of brine wells. Archaeological evidence of Song dynasty salt drilling tools used are kept and displayed in the Zigong Salt Industry Museum. Many of the wells were sunk deeper than 450 m and at least one well was more than 1000 meters deep. The medieval Venetian traveler to China, Marco Polo, reported an annual production in a single province of more than 30,000 tonnes of brine during his time there. According to Salt: A World History, a Qing Dynasty well, also in Zigong, \\"continued down to 3,300 feet (1,000 m) making it at the time the deepest drilled well in the world.\\" References Category:Chinese inventions Category:History of Sichuan Category:Mining techniques Category:Salt production ","title":"Salt well"},{"id":"20716206","text":"NHS Wales () is the publicly funded healthcare system of Wales.

During that same year, he had a serious motorcycle accident. Within two months he had completely recovered and returned to work. At one time he lived in Oneonta, New York and has three children who went to college. Lightning accident In 1994, when Tony Cicoria was 42 years old, he was struck by lightning near Albany, New York, while standing next to a public telephone. He had just hung up the phone and was about a foot away when a rogue bolt of lightning struck. He recalled seeing his own body on the ground surrounded by a bluish-white light. Cicoria‚Äôs heart had apparently stopped, but he was resuscitated by a woman (coincidentally an intensive-care-unit nurse), who was waiting to use the telephone. ArchivedSacks, Oliver. Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain. Knopf; 1 edition (October 16, 2007). ; . Cicoria suffered burns to his face and left foot where the electrical charge had entered and exited his body. Several weeks after the accident Cicoria consulted a neurologist because he was having difficulties with his memory and was feeling sluggish. The neurological exam, including an EEG and an MRI, found nothing unusual. After a few weeks his energy returned and he went back to work. Two weeks later, his memory problems disappeared. His life had apparently returned to normal.Oliver Sacks, A Bolt from the Blue: Sudden Musicophilia (from Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain) Then Cicoria, over a period of two or three days, became struck with an insatiable desire to listen to piano music.Zaria Gorvett, The mystery of why some people become sudden geniuses: There‚Äôs mounting evidence that brain damage has the power to unlock extraordinary creative talents.

His head was flooded with music that seemed to come from nowhere. Although before his accident, he had had no particular interest in music, within three months of being struck by lightning Cicoria spent nearly all his time playing and composing.Electrifying Encounter Featured in The New Yorker Magazine, Artistic career Tony Cicoria debuted his first piano composition in Westport, Connecticut, on October 12, 2007. In 2007, under the direction of Polly van der Linde, who runs an international piano camp for adults and children in Old Bennington, Vermont, Tony has given recitals at the Sonata Adult Piano Camp, in Bennington, Vermont, where he has played Chopin‚Äôs Military Polonaise, Op. 40 (in 2002), Chopin‚Äôs Fantaisie-Impromptu (in 2003), Brahms‚Äô Rhapsody, Op. 79, No. 2 (in 2005), Chopin‚Äôs Scherzo in B-flat Minor, Op. 31 (in 2006) and an earlier version of his own composition, Lightning Sonata.

He formerly worked as an attorney in the United States Department of Justice (USDOJ) Office of Intelligence Policy and Review during 2004 when senior Justice officials responded to the warrantless NSA surveillance concerning eavesdropping on U.S. citizens. He was an anonymous whistleblower to The New York Times, making the initial disclosures which led to reporters winning Pulitzer Prizes in 2006. Although Maryland agreed to drop ethics charges against him in 2009 relating to those disclosures, and the USDOJ announced it had dropped its investigation in 2011, the D.C. Office of Bar Counsel announced in January 2016 that it had brought disciplinary charges against Tamm relating to those events. Despite some controversy with respect to politicisation of that office and similar charges being brought to silence attorney whistleblowers especially beginning in 2014, Tamm in March 2016 agreed to public censure by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in order to allow him to proceed with his life and career.https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-03-24/warrantless-wiretap- whistleblower-agrees-to-punishment-for-exposing-bush-era-surveillance Background The son of a former assistant director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, nephew of another former FBI assistant director who became a U.S. Court of Appeals judge for the District of Columbia Circuit (Edward Allen Tamm), and brother of another career FBI agent, Tamm attended Brown University and graduated in 1974. After graduating from Georgetown Law School and being admitted to the bar, Tamm joined the state's attorney's office, and after gaining additional experience, joined the United States Department of Justice's Capital Case Unit, where he litigated death penalty cases. He eventually joined the Office of Intelligence Policy and Review, where he was liaison with the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance (FISA) Court.https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/government-elections- politics/united-states-of-secrets/the-frontline-interview-thomas-tamm/ A New York Times article on December 16, 2005 via commondreams.org exposing the warrantless NSA surveillance for the first time was based on his initial tip- offs. Reporters James Risen and Eric Lichtblau won a Pulitzer prize for that reporting in 2006.https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-01-27/pre-snowden- whistleblower-thomas-tamm-faces-misconduct-charges-12-years-later In 2007, FBI agents raided Tamm's house. on suspicion of his involvement in leaking the details, but it was not until 2008 ‚Äì online on December 13 and then in the December 22 issue of Newsweek ‚Äì that his role was confirmed and Tamm began speaking out publicly. On April 26, 2011, after inauguration of President Barack Obama (who had criticized the program) and a lengthy criminal investigation, the Justice Department announced that it would be dropping its investigation of Tamm and would not file charges. Media Exposure in 2012-2013 On August 22, 2012 The New York Times published an Op-doc (a forum of short documentaries produced by independent filmmakers), produced by Laura Poitras and entitled, The Program.Poitras, Laura, The Program, New York Times Op-Docs, August 22, 2012 The producer characterized it as preliminary work that would be included in a documentary planned for release in 2013, as the final part of the trilogy based on interviews with William Binney, a 32-year veteran of the National Security Agency, who also became a whistleblower and described the details of the Stellar Wind project that he helped to design. Binney stated that the program he worked on, the facility being built at Bluffdale, Utah, had been designed for foreign espionage, but in 2001 was converted to spying on citizens in the United States, prompting concerns by him and others that the actions were illegal and unconstitutional, which led to disclosures. On October 29, 2012 the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments regarding the constitutionality of the amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) that were used to authorize the creation of such facilities and justify such actions. The determination of the court was not unanimous in James R. Clapper, Jr., Director Of National Intelligence, et al., Petitioners v. Amnesty International USA et al.,Clapper v. Amnesty International USA ( ) 638 F. 3d 118, reversed and remanded, No. 11‚Äì1025. Argued October 29, 2012‚ÄîDecided February 26, 2013 as Justice Breyer filed a dissenting opinion, with whom Justice Ginsburg, Justice Sotomayor, and Justice Kagan joined. In December 2013, the Public Broadcasting System's Frontline documentary series interviewed Tamm concerning the FISA Court. Bar Discipline In January, 2016, the District of Columbia Office of Disciplinary Counsel announced, first to the National Law Journal, that in December it had filed ethics charges against Tamm (a member of the D.C. Bar since 1978) as a result of an investigation that it claimed dated back to 2009, for violating the confidences of his then-client the U.S. Department of Justice. Whistleblower lawyers analogized this to the ongoing disciplinary case brought in 2014 upon a complaint by General Electric against Washington D.C. whistleblower lawyer Lynne Bernabei and Notre Dame Law School professor G. Robert Blakey for advising in-house counsel Adriana Koeck to make her disclosures publicly to a New York Times reporter, as well as to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and federal prosecutors.http://www.corporatecrimereporter.com/news/200/whistleblower- lawyers-counterattack-against-dc-disciplinary-counsel/ In December, the 80-year old and retired Blakey agreed to accept similar unappealable discipline with respect to his advice to former student Koeck.http://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/emeritus-law-professor-sanctioned-over- the-disclosure-of-documents/ Tamm's attorney said the Maryland Bar had investigated Tamm for the same disclosures in 2009, and decided not to press charges. On March 24, 2016, the National Law Journal reported that Tamm had agreed to accept censure by the D.C. Court of Appeals to resolve that disciplinary proceeding and allow him to continue his life and career, rather than face the prospect of many years of litigation before many courts.http://www.nationallawjournal.com/id=1202753110833/Former-DOJ-Lawyer- Accepts-Public-Censure-for-Leaking-BushEra-Surveillance Awards * 2009 Ridenhour Truth-Telling Prize See also * List of whistleblowers * Edward Snowden * William Binney and Diane Roark * Thomas Andrews Drake * Mark Klein * Russ Tice * Perry Fellwock * Hepting v.

It was produced between 1931 and 1941. Design and development The A40 was introduced in the depths of the Great Depression. At the time there were a number of small engines available but all suffered from either high cost, complexity, or low reliability. The A-40 addressed all those shortcomings and was instrumental in the production of light aircraft in the difficult economic constraints of the period. The A-40-4 introduced an increase in power to .

The Panama microplate is bordered to the north by the Panama deformed belt and a diffuse thrust belt in the cordillera central of costa rica. These thrust belts are being controlled by the active convergence of the Caribbean plate towards Central America. The eastern edge of the Panama plate is progressively conjoining with the continental plate of South America. Its western end is in contact with the continental Chortis Block lying along a late cretaceous convergence zone where the Mesquito Composite Oceanic Terrane is exposed. The plate‚Äôs southern boundary is a subduction zone composed of the downward moving Cocos and Nazca plates. The western expanse of the Panama microplate is characterized by deformation originating from the Tertiary and Quaternary, linking the North Panama deformed belt in the east with the Middle America trench in the west. Major changes in tectonic evolution exist across the Caribbean-Panama boundary, where three northeast-striking faults intersect with the Pacific coast. The Pacific side of the region is geologically active, with a narrow marine shelf exhibiting frequent volcanic activity and higher seismic activity, and the Atlantic side is more stable with a passive margin and broader marine shelf.  Age  The geologic processes that shaped Central America the way it is seen present day were completed about 3 million years ago. Panama is the southernmost portion of Central America and is the youngest section of the land bridge now connecting North and South America. The land bridge had finished forming around 3.5 million years ago during the late Pliocene-early Pleistocene with the closing of the Caribbean-Pacific seaway.  Kinematics  The Panama microplate is moving northward in relation to the Caribbean Plate. Its ongoing collision with South America occurs at a rate of approximately 10-20 millimeters a year.  Studies  Initial geologic studies of Central America revealed structural and stratigraphic differences between its northern and southern regions. Later studies grouped the regions of Guatemala, Honduras and the majority of Nicaragua onto the structure termed the Chortis block. Further south, the remaining portion of Central America was observed to have similar yet distinct geologic characteristics from the Chortis block. This region, subsequently termed the Panama microplate has since been subdivided into two separate but geologically similar tectonic blocks: The Chortega block and the Choco block.

He played in 82 games for the Cincinnati Reds in . Early life Sipek was born in Chicago, Illinois on January 26, 1923 to Emily and John Sipek. Around the age of five, he became deaf, with the definitive cause being unknown. Theories involved an accident, an illness, or genetic. He was sent to the Illinois School for the Deaf, where he thrived. His housefather was Dummy Taylor, who had won over a hundred games as a major league pitcher. Taylor sent letters to the New York Giants and the Cincinnati Reds to send a scout to evaluate Sipek's ability to play, with the Reds signing him to a contract. https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/8ab4e4dd Baseball career At the age of 20, he started his career in the minors. He played for the Birmingham Barons of the Southern Association and the Erwin Aces of the Appalachian League. He batted .336 in 74 games for the former while batting .424 in 37 games for the latter. The following year, he remained with the Barons, playing in 134 games while batting .319. Sipek was called up to start for the Reds for the beginning of the 1945 season. On April 28, he made his debut with the team, pinch hitting for Joe Just in the bottom of the ninth inning. He was walked by Blix Donnelly to load the bases as the Reds won the game later in the inning on a walk off error over the St. Louis Cardinals. https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CIN/CIN194504280.shtml Sipek mostly appeared as a pinch hitter, with occasional starts in left or right field. He made 170 plate appearances with 156 at-bats, having 38 hits and 13 RBIs with nine walks and 15 strikeouts for a .244 batting average. As a fielder, he had a .972 fielding percentage, making 68 putouts, two assists, and two errors. After the season, he was sent back to the minors. The following year, he played with the Syracuse Chiefs in the Triple-A International League, batting .245 in 98 games. The next year was spent with the Columbia Reds in the Single-A South Atlantic League, where he batted .272 in 127 games. He spent the final four years of his career with the Reidsville Luckies of the Carolina League, highlighted by a .322 season in 137 games in his last year in 1951. His career ended when he broke his collarbone during a dive for a fly ball. Post career and death After his career was over, he lived in Quincy, Illinois, where he lived with his wife Betty Ann Schmidt, who also attended the Illinois School for the Deaf, with two of their three children subsequently attending the school. He worked in a bakery and as a custodian at St. Mary School. Sipek died on July 17, 2005 at the age of 82.

Biography Auerswald was born in Faulen, West Prussia where the family possessed the estates of Plauth and Tromnau. He entered the Prussian army in 1813 and by 1848 had become a major general. Three precincts had elected him to the Frankfurt parliament where he joined the conservatives, but he did not participate in the party leadership or the debates. On September 17, 1848, a gathering on the Pfingstweide in Frankfurt led by Franz Zitz had, on account of the parliament's decision regarding the truce of Malm√∂, declared the members thereof traitors to the fatherland, freedom and honor. The result was the uprising on the next day where a mob went looking for Reichsminister Hekscher and Prince Felix Lichnowsky. Auerswald had ridden out with Lichnowsky, and by the Friedberger Gate, the mob discovered them. They tried to flee. At the Bethmann villa, Auerswald was mortally felled by a pistol shot. Lichnowsky was beaten up and died the next day.

The plate is bordered on three sides by the Antarctic Plate and the fourth side is bordered by the Scotia Plate. The northwestern border is defined by the South Shetland Trench separating the Shetland Plate to the south from the Antarctic Plate to the north. This trench is the remnant of a subduction zone where the defunct Phoenix Plate, now part of the Antarctic Plate, subducted under the Antarctic Peninsula and the Shetland Islands. The southeastern border is rift zone with the Antarctic Plate creating the Bransfield Basin. The southwestern and northeastern boundaries are each part of larger fracture zones. The southwestern border is the Hero Fracture Zone and separates the Antarctic Plate to the southwest from the Shetland Plate to the northeast. The northeastern boundary is the Shackleton Fracture Zone and separates the Shetland Plate to the southwest from the Scotia Plate.  Geologic history  The Shetland Plate started forming 3 to 4 million years ago. Prior to formation, the Shetland Plate was part of the Antarctic Plate adjacent to the Antarctic Peninsula. During this period, the Phoenix Plate to the northwest, was subducting under the Antarctic Peninsula and the South Shetland Islands, which created the South Shetland Trench. Approximately 3 million years ago spreading stopped at the Antarctic-Phoenix spreading center in Drake Passage. The Phoenix Plate is now considered part of the larger Antarctic Plate due to a lack of relative movement between the two since spreading ceased. However, subduction in the South Shetland Trench did not cease. Slab rollback of the former Phoenix Plate underneath the South Shetland Islands caused rifting to develop in the Antarctic Peninsula creating the Shetland Plate and the Bransfield Basin. Rifting centers in the Bransfield Basin continue to separate the Shetland Plate from the Antarctic Peninsula.  Tectonic setting  South Shetland Trench = The South Shetland Trench forms the northwest border of the Shetland Plate. The trench is formed by the subduction of the Antarctic Plate in the north under the Shetland Plate in the south. Subduction along this trench has slowed significantly over time, from per year over the last 30 million years to per year in the last 6 million years. Current subduction is caused by the movement of the Shetland Plate northward, as well as, slab rollback of the former Phoenix Plate. = Bransfield Basin = Boundaries and bathymetry of the Shetland Plate. The Bransfield Basin forms the southeast border of the Shetland Plate. The basin separates the Shetland Plate on the north and the Antarctic Plate to the south. The basin is a back-arc rift basin. The basin ranges from to more than deep. = Fracture Zones = The Shackleton Fracture Zone is the northeast border of the Shetland Plate. The fracture zone is a series of parallel transform faults separating the Scotia Plate from the Shetland Plate. This border with the Scotia Plate is the only Shetland Plate boundary that is not with the Antarctic Plate. The Hero Fracture Zone is the southwest boundary of the Shetland Plate. This feature separates the Shetland Plate from the Antarctic Plate. These parallel faults connect the Bransfield Basin in the south to the South Shetland Trench in the north.  Volcanism  Absolute K-Ar ages indicate volcanism has been active from the Cenozoic to the present. Current volcanism can be seen at places like Deception Island and Penguin Island. Calc-alkaline plutons, a type of magma seen above subduction zones, date from the Cenozoic to the Miocene and is coincident with the active subduction of the Phoenix plate under Antarctica. More recent Pliocene dated volcanism in the Bransfield basin has transitional chemistry between subduction zone calc-alkaline and mid ocean ridge tholeiitic magmas. The transitional chemistry can be explained by back-arc rifting in the Bransfield Basin.  Earthquakes  Since the early 1980s earthquakes have been recorded in the Shetland Plate. The amount of data has been limited by remoteness, severe weather, and a lack of permeant seismic stations in the area. Intermediate depth earthquakes (35‚Äì55 km) under the South Shetland Islands indicates that subduction is still occurring at the Shetland Trench.

The original founding members were: guitarist Neil Rogers (The Derelicts, Glazed), singer Robb Clarke (Trids, RC5,The Burnz), bassist Mark Wooten (The Zanny Guys, Noble Firs) and drummer Dan Cunneen (Final Warning, The Obituaries, Seattle's Nightcaps,).  History  ZIPGUN was formed and led by Neil Rogers, who had previously played guitar for Sub Pop recording artists The Derelicts. In 1993, Mark Wooten quit the band and was replaced by bassist Andy Sheen. In late 1993 Sheen quit the band and was replaced by former Derelicts bassist Ian Dunsmore. ZIPGUN broke up in 1994 and then reunited in 1996 for a single show at The Breakroom in Seattle with original bassist, Mark Wooten.  Background  While ZIPGUN hailed from Seattle in the early 1990s, their music is not considered Grunge. ZIPGUN was one of a number of Seattle bands that avoided the prevailing musical trend, instead choosing to play punk rock. Other Seattle bands sharing the same philosophy during the era include: Gas Huffer, Supersuckers, The Gits, and Coffin Break. The band was known for their \\"punk and roll\\" sound, which is characterized by its raw energy and power; delivered at slower tempos than typical American hardcore. ZIPGUN mined punk rock influences like The Stooges, Ramones, The Damned, and Buzzcocks. They also added elements of then-current bands like Screaming Trees and Mudhoney into their sound. ZIPGUN was also known for their unpredictable stage performances and sometimes volatile interaction between singer Robb Clarke and guitarist Neil Rogers. (For instance, at their alcohol fueled debut show at Seattle's Crocodile Cafe, Rogers famously broke his Gibson SG guitar over Clarke's back.)  Legacy  ZIPGUN released three singles and two full-length albums on Pacific Northwest independent record label, Empty Records and several other singles on various labels. The band toured extensively throughout the United States and Canada and appeared in the Doug Pray film Hype!, a documentary chronicling the 1990s Seattle Grunge music scene. Currently, Rogers plays in Communist Eyes and The Derelicts (reformed in 2017). Clarke continues to play and record with the Seattle punk band The Burnz. Cunneen plays drums for Roxbury Saints and the Perkins Coie Band.

Lichnowsky was born in Vienna. He entered the Prussian army in 1834, but left it in 1838 to enter the service of the Spanish pretender Don Carlos, where he received the rank of brigadier general. He fought a duel with the Spanish General Montenegro and was severely wounded, but recovered. In 1847, he was elected by Ratibor to Prussia's United Diet, and was elected to the national parliament in 1848 where he took his seat on the right. Here he put to use his substantial oratorical skills, though frequently using them to dazzle rather than enlighten, and his demeaning characterizations of the left earned him a poor reputation in those quarters. When the uprising broke out on 18 September in consequence of the parliament's decision regarding the truce of Malm√∂ (in the debate for which Lichnowsky had spoken in very conciliatory terms), disdaining all warnings, he rode out with General von Auerswald to meet the troops arriving from W√ºrttemberg. A group of upset citizens recognized them on the Bornheimer Highway and chased them. Von Auerswald was shot to death and Lichnowsky beaten up and died the next day in Baron Bethmann's villa in Frankfurt.

The Olympic selection crew raced the 1952 King's Cup for New South Wales during its preparation and was comprehensively beaten by Victoria. The media then claimed the Victorian crew should be nominated instead. However the selector Joe Gould stuck with the selected crew since a number of them including stroke Phil Cayzer, had severe adverse reactions to the vaccinations they'd taken for overseas travel. It was also mentioned that their fundraising responsibilities, some 7,000 pounds, impacted their preparation - the Australian Olympic Federation had only been able to fund four air tickets for the eight.

Equivalently, if one permutes the variables, the polynomial changes in value by the sign of the permutation: :f\\\\left(x_{\\\\sigma(1)},\\\\dots,x_{\\\\sigma(n)}\\\\right)= \\\\mathrm{sgn}(\\\\sigma) f(x_1,\\\\dots,x_n). More generally, a polynomial f(x_1,\\\\dots,x_n,y_1,\\\\dots,y_t) is said to be alternating in x_1,\\\\dots,x_n if it changes sign if one switches any two of the x_i, leaving the y_j fixed.Polynomial Identities and Asymptotic Methods, p. 12 Relation to symmetric polynomials Products of symmetric and alternating polynomials (in the same variables x_1,\\\\dots,x_n) behave thus: * the product of two symmetric polynomials is symmetric, * the product of a symmetric polynomial and an alternating polynomial is alternating, and * the product of two alternating polynomials is symmetric. This is exactly the addition table for parity, with \\"symmetric\\" corresponding to \\"even\\" and \\"alternating\\" corresponding to \\"odd\\". Thus, the direct sum of the spaces of symmetric and alternating polynomials forms a superalgebra (a \\\\mathbf{Z}_2-graded algebra), where the symmetric polynomials are the even part, and the alternating polynomials are the odd part. This grading is unrelated to the grading of polynomials by degree. In particular, alternating polynomials form a module over the algebra of symmetric polynomials (the odd part of a superalgebra is a module over the even part); in fact it is a free module of rank 1, with the Vandermonde polynomial in n variables as generator . If the characteristic of the coefficient ring is 2, there is no difference between the two concepts: the alternating polynomials are precisely the symmetric polynomials. Vandermonde polynomial The basic alternating polynomial is the Vandermonde polynomial: :v_n = \\\\prod_{1\\\\le i This is clearly alternating, as switching two variables changes the sign of one term and does not change the others.Rather, it only rearranges the other terms: for n=3, switching x_1 and x_2 changes (x_2-x_1) to (x_1-x_2) = -(x_2-x_1), and exchanges (x_3-x_1) with (x_3-x_2), but does not change their sign. The alternating polynomials are exactly the Vandermonde polynomial times a symmetric polynomial: a = v_n \\\\cdot s where s is symmetric. This is because: * v_n is a factor of every alternating polynomial: (x_j-x_i) is a factor of every alternating polynomial, as if x_i=x_j, the polynomial is zero (since switching them does not change the polynomial, we get :f(x_1,\\\\dots,x_i,\\\\dots,x_j,\\\\dots,x_n) = f(x_1,\\\\dots,x_j,\\\\dots,x_i,\\\\dots,x_n) = -f(x_1,\\\\dots,x_i,\\\\dots,x_j,\\\\dots,x_n), :so (x_j-x_i) is a factor), and thus v_n is a factor. * an alternating polynomial times a symmetric polynomial is an alternating polynomial; thus all multiples of v_n are alternating polynomials Conversely, the ratio of two alternating polynomials is a symmetric function, possibly rational (not necessarily a polynomial), though the ratio of an alternating polynomial over the Vandermonde polynomial is a polynomial. Schur polynomials are defined in this way, as an alternating polynomial divided by the Vandermonde polynomial. =Ring structure= Thus, denoting the ring of symmetric polynomials by Œõn, the ring of symmetric and alternating polynomials is \\\\Lambda_n[v_n], or more precisely \\\\Lambda_n[v_n]/\\\\langle v_n^2-\\\\Delta\\\\rangle, where \\\\Delta=v_n^2 is a symmetric polynomial, the discriminant. That is, the ring of symmetric and alternating polynomials is a quadratic extension of the ring of symmetric polynomials, where one has adjoined a square root of the discriminant. Alternatively, it is: :R[e_1,\\\\dots,e_n,v_n]/\\\\langle v_n^2-\\\\Delta\\\\rangle. If 2 is not invertible, the situation is somewhat different, and one must use a different polynomial W_n, and obtains a different relation; see Romagny. Representation theory From the perspective of representation theory, the symmetric and alternating polynomials are subrepresentations of the action of the symmetric group on n letters on the polynomial ring in n variables. (Formally, the symmetric group acts on n letters, and thus acts on derived objects, particularly free objects on n letters, such as the ring of polynomials.) The symmetric group has two 1-dimensional representations: the trivial representation and the sign representation. The symmetric polynomials are the trivial representation, and the alternating polynomials are the sign representation. Formally, the scalar span of any symmetric (resp., alternating) polynomial is a trivial (resp., sign) representation of the symmetric group, and multiplying the polynomials tensors the representations. In characteristic 2, these are not distinct representations, and the analysis is more complicated. If n>2, there are also other subrepresentations of the action of the symmetric group on the ring of polynomials, as discussed in representation theory of the symmetric group. Unstable Alternating polynomials are an unstable phenomenon (in the language of stable homotopy theory): the ring of symmetric polynomials in n variables can be obtained from the ring of symmetric polynomials in arbitrarily many variables by evaluating all variables above x_n to zero: symmetric polynomials are thus stable or compatibly defined. However, this is not the case for alternating polynomials, in particular the Vandermonde polynomial. See also * Symmetric polynomial * Euler class NotesReferences * A.

In 1870 he earned his doctorate in mineralogy and geology at the University of Leipzig. In 1872 he joined as a volunteer at the Imperial Geological Reichsanstalt in Vienna. Later that same year he obtained Austrian citizenship. In 1879-80 he led the first trans-Sahara expedition from Morocco to Senegal. The primary purpose of the expedition was to perform geological studies of the region, investigating the possibilities of iron ore deposits. In 1880, with his Spaniard companion Cristobal Ben√≠tez, he became only the fourth European to visit the fabled city of Timbuktu. The others being, Alexander Gordon Laing (1826), Ren√© Cailli√© (1828) and Heinrich Barth (1853). Map depicting Lenz' expedition to Timbuktu In 1885-87 he directed the Austro-Hungarian Congo Expedition, a mission that involved crossing the African continent from the Congo eastward to the Indian Ocean. The main reasons of the project were to survey the economic trade situation in the newly established Congo Free State and to map the Congo-Nile watershed between the Nile and Congo Rivers. On the expedition, he was accompanied by cartographer Oskar Baumann (up until succumbing to illness on the mission) and ornithologist Friedrich Bohndorff.

He coached at state and national representative level taking Australian Olympic crews to success in the 1960s. Rowing career Cayzer was schooled at St Joseph's College, Hunters Hill and his senior rowing was done with the Sydney Rowing Club with whom Cayzer would have a lifelong association. During the 1970s in Melbourne he would be a senior clubman at the Mercantile club. He stroked the New South Wales representative eight in the King's Cup at the Interstate Regatta within the Australian Rowing Championships on five occasions from 1948 to 1954. Those crews won the national championship in 1949, 1950 and 1951. Following New South Wales' 1949 win in the King's Cup, the crew was selected in toto to represent Australia in the eights competition at the Empire Games at Lake Karapiro in February 1950, where Cayzer stroked the crew to victory over New Zealand by just a foot. The New South Wales 1950 Kings Cup win also resulted in the opportunity to represent Australia and the crew travelled to the Canterbury Centennial Games and 1951 New Zealand Championships, defeating the University of California by a canvas in both races. An all-New South Wales crew was selected to represent Australia at the 1952 Henley Royal Regatta and 1952 Helsinki Olympics. At Henley in the final for the Grand Challenge Cup the crew, again stroked by Cayzer, placed second to Leander by 0.8 seconds. The same crew then competed in the Olympic eights in Helsinki, winning a bronze medal behind USA and Russia. Coaching career After retiring from rowing Cayzer took up coaching. He was the Senior Coach at the Sydney Rowing Club for most for the sixties while also coaching numerous New South Wales representative Kings Cup crews. He coached the coxed four of Alf Duval, Alan Grover, Mick Allan, John Campbell and Gary Herford selected to compete at Tokyo 1964. He drove Sydney Rowing Club's association with Olympic representative crews recruiting a number of national senior rowers to join Duval, Grover and Joe Fazio at Sydney to create the men's eight for the 1968 Summer Olympics. He coached the crew both in Australia and in Mexico. In the 1970s Cayzer relocated to Melbourne for business and became actively involved at the Mercantile club, rowing in social crews and becoming one of the club's most senior coaches. He returned to Sydney in the 1980s and continued to coach club, state and national crews till the early 2000s.

Cycling in New Zealand, while relatively popular as a sport, is a very marginal commuting mode, with the share hovering around 1-3% in most major cities. This is due to a number of factors, principally safety fears. History Thames in the late 19th century The bicycle reached New Zealand in the 1860s in the form of the velocipede, also known as the 'boneshaker'. As bicycle design improved, and production became mass-market, cycling became a popular mode of transport in many parts of New Zealand for half a century. In the 1950s and 60s government transport funding and policies favouring motor vehicles as the transport of the future, along with the increasing affordability of automobiles, spurred a rise in motor vehicles. New Zealand soon had, and still has, one of the highest rates of car dependence in the world. As well as abandoning bicycles (and public transport) in favour of cars, the remaining bicyclists were increasingly forced off the streets by the rising danger of motor traffic, relegating bicycles to recreational and sports use. The oil shocks of the 1970s triggered the first of several bicycle resurgences, and new sports bicycles became popular: first, road racing bikes, then BMXs and eventually mountain bikes. By 1990, a survey showed cycling to be the second most popular participation sport in New Zealand. Since then, cycle sales have remained high, averaging over 150,000 per annum. However, their everyday uses, such as for commuting or shopping, is still rare. In 1994, New Zealand introduced mandatory bicycle helmet wearing, a change which some parts of academia and cycling advocacy credit with further reducing the incidence and attractiveness of cycling. Since the 1990s, a number of local Councils have developed cycling (or walking & cycling) strategies to plan for the provision of cycle-friendly environments and the promotion of cycling for transport and recreation. The Government, in its 2002 NZ Transport Strategy (and 2008 revision), officially acknowledged the role that cycling can play in helping to achieve a number of strategic transport outcomes, and in 2005 the first national Walking and Cycling Strategy \\"Getting There: On Foot, By Cycle\\" was released. However, from 2008 the new National-led Government set aside this strategy and restricted funding for cycling facilities, citing the need for motorway investment instead.Delivering the roads of national significance, NZTA, Aug 2012 The one significant investment from 2010 was the \\"Model Walking and Cycling Communities\\" programme, which saw $7 million invested over 2 years in the two chosen communities, Hastings and New Plymouth, as demonstration projects of what could be achieved with concentrated focus \\\\- a further $15 million was then earmarked to these towns for 2012‚Äì15.Encouraging walking and cycling, NZTA, Aug 2012 Following a spate of cycle crashes in late 2010, a national coronial inquiry considered the issue of cycle safety. After hearing submissions from a wide range of parties, Coroner Matenga recommended in 2013 that an expert panel, led by the NZ Transport Agency, be put together to recommend to central and local government how to prevent further cycling deaths and improve safety. A Cycle Safety Panel of ten specialists was convened in 2014 and spent the year gathering evidence and then making a wide-ranging series of recommendations. A key recommendation was that a significant injection in cycleway infrastructure funding was required by Government. As a result, a $100 million Urban Cycleways Fund was announced by the Government and, in conjunction with existing local and national transport funding, this led to a record $330 million cycleways programme over 2015‚Äì18. Cycling is increasingly becoming a touristic and (at least local) economic factor in the 2010s. In addition to successful cycle touring schemes (like those gathered under the New Zealand Cycle Trail umbrella) credited with revitalising local back country areas, are experiences like those reported from Rotorua, where the mountain biking business within the Whakarewarewa timber plantation forest is several times that earned annually from the timber plantation itself.  Factors  In the mid 2000s, Auckland Regional Transport Authority reported that ‚Äúover half of Aucklanders believe it is usually unsafe, or always unsafe, to cycle‚Äù.Bean, C. E., Kearns, R. & Collins, D., 2008, Exploring Social Mobilities: Narratives of Walking and Driving in Auckland, New Zealand, Urban Studies 45(13), pp.2829‚Äì2848. This high perceived risk to bicycle users in New Zealand's largest city is due to a number of factors. Motorists tend to exhibit hostile attitudes towards bicycle riders. Bicycles are classed as 'vehicles', a transport class legally obliged to use the road, forcing bicycle users to mingle with heavy and fast-moving motor vehicles; only postal workers are legally permitted to ride on footpaths.Rules for cycling in the Road Code Accessed 20 December 2009 Bicycle infrastructure and the standards underpinning bicycle infrastructure planning are poor and bicycles receive relatively very low levels of funding by both central and local government. Press release on funding levels  Infrastructure  In recent decades a number of cycleways have been established through New Zealand, most of them rail trails. *The Otago Central Rail Trail is a 150 kilometre walking, cycling or horse riding track in the South Island. It runs in an arc between Middlemarch and Clyde, along the route of the former Otago Central Railway. *The Hawke's Bay Trails, which are in turn part of Nga Haerenga, the New Zealand Cycle Trail project, are made up of three distinct sections - the Landscapes Ride, the Water Ride and the Wineries Ride - and form a 'Great Ride' of more than . *The Timber Trail is an 84 kilometre long adventure trail opened in 2013 traversing ancient podocarp forests and utilising some of the engineering remnants of the Ellis and Burnand bush tramway from the early 1900s. Located in the Pureora Forest park, it is the most centrally located forest conservation area in the North Island. *Mountains to Sea ‚Äì NgƒÅ Ara T≈´hono is one of the 22 Great Rides that make up the Nga Haerenga - NZ Cycle Trail network. Comprising 242 kilometres of connected cycle trails (plus an exciting river jetboat trip), and taking riders from T≈´roa on Mt Ruapehu navigating the Whanganui River to the Tasman Sea at North Mole. Including Ohakune Old Coach Road, Mangapurua (Bridge to Nowhere), Kaiwhakauka, Fishers Track, Whanganui River Road and Whanganui Urban routes. *The Little River Rail Trail is a cycling and walking track established near Little River on Banks Peninsula in the Canterbury region of the South Island. The first section opened in May 2006. *The route of the defunct Dun Mountain Railway is regularly used for cycling. *The Rimutaka Incline, replaced by the Rimutaka Tunnel in 1955, has now been established as a cycling route. *Pipiwharauroa Way near Raglan. *Christchurch, which has historically had one of the highest rates of cycling in the country (currently 7% commuters), has over 200 kilometres of cycle lanes, pathways, and other cycling facilities, including the Railway Cycleway and Hagley Park. *In Auckland, there are a growing number of urban cycleways through the city. *The 2017 Kapiti Expressway (MacKays to Peka Peka) SH1 has an extensive new cycle path along 18km of the new highway. The cycle paths also crosslink the existing urban area to improve walking, cycle and horse riding routes. = New Zealand Cycle Trail = In early 2009, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, John Key, proposed a 'New Zealand Cycleway' and in mid 2009, $50 million for the first three years was set aside for construction of a network of 'Great Rides' (Nga Haerenga), most of which opened between 2011 and 2013.  Events and races  A number of cycling events are held around the country as fun rides, fundraisers or competitive cycling events: *The 160 km Lake Taupo Cycle Challenge has been held since 1977 and is predominately a non-competitive event. The event raises money for the Lake Taupo community.Lake Taupo Cycle Challenge *The 100 km Christchurch to Akaroa Le Race has been held annually since 2000. It has been described as a \\"tough hill-climbing event\\". *The Tour of Southland is a road bicycle racing stage race held in Southland. *The Tour de Vineyards is a road cycling race held in and around Richmond. The race exists of both a men's and a women's competition over four stages. *The Graperide is a 101 km cycling race based around Blenheim. *The TelstraClear Challenge is a variety of events centred on the Auckland Harbour Bridge and Northern Busway, including a 110 km race and a variety of cycling culture events, taking place for the first time in December 2011. *New Zealand's most historic cycle race, the Christchurch-to-Timaru event, was discontinued in 2009, after having been held 87 times since 1899. The reason cited was that the traffic management required was too expensive for the small local cycling club to put on the event anymore. Organisations and institutions Cycling Action Network (CAN) is a national cycling advocacy group founded in November 1996.ChainLinks magazine Issue 6-2006 refer page 4 It aims to achieve a better cycling environment for cycling as transport and tourism. Major initiatives are the annual Cycle Friendly Awards and support for a biennial Cycling Conference (now held as a joint walking & cycling conference). CAN is the parent organisation for some 20 local cycling advocacy groups around the country, including Bike Auckland, Cycle Aware Wellington and Spokes Canterbury. BikeNZ was created in July 2003 to act as an umbrella body embracing all national bike and cycling organisations including, BMX NZ, CAN, Cycling NZ, Mountain Bike NZ and NZ Schools Cycling Association. It is the national governing body of cycle racing and has a strong focus on sports cycling; in 2014 BikeNZ rebranded as Cycling NZ. CAN was a member of BikeNZ and provided one board member from BikeNZ's inception in July 2003. CAN resigned from BikeNZ in October 2007, ChainLinks magazine Issue 4-2007 page 16 but continues to work with BikeNZ on advocacy issues. Vorb is an online forum set up by Tama Easton as a place for stories and photos from mountain bike trips of a group of friends. In early 2001 it became public, got mentioned in the media and quickly grew into one of the most used sports and outdoors websites in New Zealand, long extending beyond just mountain biking or even cycling. The Vorb community has grown into tens of thousands of cyclists, trampers, climbers, paddlers and others.http://www.vorb.org.nz/rez_page.php?id=about About Vorb Vorb has won \\"Best Sports and Recreation Site\\" at the People's Choice Netguide Web Awards for 2007, 2008 and 2009 in the 'Best Sports and Recreation Site' category.http://www.infonews.co.nz/news.cfm?id=39887 2009 People's Choice NetGuide Web Awards results 2008 People's Choice NetGuide Web Awards results Helmets Since 1994 it has been mandatory by law to wear a bicycle helmet while riding a bicycle in New Zealand. The law was enacted after intense lobbying by Rebecca Oaten after her son was injured in a cycle accident. A study on bicycle helmets using cost-benefit analysis found that the law was only cost-effective for the 5- to 12-year-old age group. A Massey University study in 2006 found that compulsory bicycle helmet laws led to a lower uptake of cycling, especially among women. Advocacy groups like Cycle Action Auckland have argued that helmets are useful safety devices, but noted out that some cyclists consider them a symbol portraying cycling as dangerous, especially when most severe cycling crashes had been shown to be caused by inattentive motorists.

HARBEC was initially established in 1977 as a contract tool and die/general machine shop. Currently, the 40,000sf facility is located just east of Rochester, in Ontario, NY. Its founder, Bob Bechtold, who expanded the business, claimed to pursue opportunities for innovation in the tool and die market. Although the company has continued to attempt to innovate, environmental concerns have also been an area of recent focus, as shown by features in various case studies. Environmental actions HARBEC has been certified as an ISO9000 and ISO14000 company, demonstrating its use of ‚Äúeco-economic‚Äù decisions and policies, designed to ensure that its activities are long-term sustainable. Further independent awards gained include the Energy Star Small Business award for significant efforts to reduce their environmental footprint. This is reflected in their slogan ‚Äútechnical innovation with environmental responsibility‚Äù. HARBEC has developed and implemented new solutions to offset emissions, utilize waste and conserve resources. An example of this is their water conservation program. They have an 800,000 gallon reservoir for their fire suppression system and heat exchange equipment. Storm water and industrial waste water are diverted into the pond, where natural vegetation and cattail remediation are used to clean the water in which fish are raised. The pond provides thermal mass which is used to dissipate the heat prior to sending it to a cooling tower. This reduces the energy necessary for total cooling requirements. HARBEC has a goal of \\"no carbon footprint by 2015\\". Currently, the facility has a 250 kW wind turbine and a twenty-five microturbine combined heat and power plant which generate electricity and provide the heating and cooling requirements of the facility. Additional points include: * Energy efficient equipment. All-electric presses have lowered energy costs by up to 50% and have increased processing speed and cycle time. * Use of low-emissions transportation. The company owns hybrid, all electric, biodiesel, and compressed natural gas vehicles. * Conversion of two of their turbines from natural gas to a liquid or gas biofuel. * A lighting system upgrade which reduced the amount of energy used by 50%. This was accomplished by replacing existing lighting with T-8 type fluorescent bulbs and reflectors throughout the plant. * Application of insulation to the barrels of every injection molding machine. This reduced 40-50% of the total process energy required for normal operation.

He was the first openly gay mayor elected in the state of Michigan. A Democrat, he resigned the office in 2010 to take a seat on the Oakland County Commission, where he served one term. Biography Born in Columbus, Ohio, Covey was an activist, and executive director of Stonewall Union (now Stonewall Columbus) in the 1980s. He lived in Michigan since moving to the state to become executive director of the Michigan Organization for Human Rights in 1985 and lived in Ferndale from 1989 until 2017.

He is credited with organizing Detroit's first Gay and Lesbian pride march, an event later known as Motor City Pride. He founded the Midwest AIDS Prevention Project. In 2001, he founded La Comunidad, a support group for gay Latino men in the metro Detroit area. Covey was also CEO of the Midwest AIDS Prevention Project and Chief Operating Officer of the Michigan AIDS Coalition, the organization resulting from the merging of MAPP and the Michigan AIDS Fund in 2009.

It was the northernmost town of Arcadia; the inhabitants of Cynaetha were the only Arcadians who lived beyond the natural boundaries of Arcadia. Their valley sloped down towards the Corinthian Gulf; and the river which flowed through it fell into the Corinthian Gulf a little to the east of Bura: this river was called in ancient times Erasinus or Buraicus, now the river of Vouraikos. The climate and situation of Cynaetha are described by Polybius as the most disagreeable in all Arcadia. The same author observes that the character of the Cynaethians presented a striking contrast to that of the other Arcadians, being a wicked and cruel race, and so much disliked by the rest of their countrymen, that the latter would scarcely hold any intercourse with them. He attributes their depravity to their neglect of music, which had tended to humanize the other Arcadians, and to counteract the natural rudeness engendered by their climate. Accordingly, he regarded the terrible misfortune which overtook the Cynaethians in the Social War, when their city was destroyed by the Aetolians, as a righteous punishment for their wickedness. Although Strabo mentions Cynaetha as one of the Arcadian towns no longer existing in his time, it must have been restored at some period after its destruction by the Aetolians, as it was visited by Pausanias, who noticed in the agora altars of the gods, a sanctuary of Dionysus, and a statue of the emperor Hadrian. The Cynaetheans gave to Olympia the statue of Zeus which held a thunderbolt in his hand. At the distance of two stadia from the town was a fountain of cold water, called Alyssus (ŒÜŒªœÖœÉœÉŒøœÇ), because it was said to cure rabies. et seq.

Schumacher was abducted by his Haredi Orthodox Jewish grandparents to prevent him from being raised as a Secular Jew by his parents, and was found in the United States after an extensive international search by Mossad before being returned to his parents' custody. Schumacher's abduction led to an early major polarization among Israeli Jews due to disagreements between Orthodox Jews, who largely supported the abduction, and Secular Jews, who largely opposed it. Background Yossele Schumacher was born in 1952 in the Soviet Union to secular Jewish parents Alter and Ida Schumacher. His maternal grandparents, Nachman and Miriam Shtrakes, were conservative Haredi Jews of the Breslov Hasidic sect. In 1958, the family immigrated to Israel, where Schumacher's parents settled on a secular kibbutz, but after running into financial difficulties they asked his maternal grandparents to look after him instead. The Shtrakes had settled in Jerusalem and joined the Breslov community there, and agreed to look after Schumacher, sending him to a religious boarding school. A few months later, the financial situation of Schumacher's parents improved and they asked for his return to their custody, but the Shtrakes, determined to raise him as a Hasidic Jew, refused due to the Schumachers' objection to bringing him up religiously. The Shtrakes also accused the Schumachers of planning on returning to the Soviet Union to raise the boy as a Communist, which was an accusation that would often be voiced by Haredi Jews. The grandparents decided to hide the boy within the Haredi community in Israel, and Nachman Shtrakes, together with his son Shalom, arranged for Yossele to be hidden away. Abduction Yoselle Schumacher was hidden in various Haredi enclaves in Jerusalem, Bnei Brak, Safed, Rishon LeZion, and Komemiyut. Israeli police launched a search operation for him, and the Israeli Supreme Court ordered the Shtrakes to return him to his parents by 15 February 1960. The grandparents refused, insisting that the parents were planning on returning to the Soviet Union, and Nachman Shtrakes was subsequently imprisoned, but still refused to divulge any information. The Haredi couple in Bnei Brak that had briefly hidden him was also imprisoned. With police still searching for Schumacher, it was decided within the Haredi community that he needed to be taken out of Israel, and they now needed to find someone who could smuggle a small child out of the country. Rabbi Abraham Eliyahu Maizes of the anti-Zionist Yeshiva (Jewish Religious College) Torah Vyirah asked one of his disciples, Ruth Blau, also known as Ruth Ben David, to do it. Blau, originally Madeleine Feraille, was a French convert to Judaism, managed an import-export firm, and attended graduate school in France and Switzerland before converting to Judaism in 1950. Although initially Zionist, she later adopted Haredi anti-Zionist views and in 1965 married Amram Blau, founder of Neturei Karta. Her son Uriel assisted her, and Yossele himself, who had been convinced that his parents did not want to bring him up as a proper Jew, cooperated. On June 21, 1960, Schumacher was taken out of Israel by Blau, who had disguised him as a girl, forged a passport for him, and then taken him on a flight to Europe.page 109. BLAU (Ruth) Les Gardiens de la cit√©. Histoire d'une guerre sainte. Paris Flammarion 1978 Schumacher would spend two years total in Europe under her care, living in Switzerland, France, and Belgium. Initially, Blau took him to Switzerland, where she enrolled him in a yeshiva. Meanwhile, authorities in Israel had increased their search efforts. =Investigation= The Haredi community criticized the Israeli government and police's desire to return Schumacher to his parents, believing it was part of a government plot to secularize as many Orthodox Jewish children as possible. The Israeli government, on the other hand, saw the refusal to return Schumacher as a direct challenge by a religious subculture to its authority. Shin Bet, the Israeli internal security service, along with Israel Defense Forces soldiers and police, searched for Schumacher in religious neighborhoods, villages, and kibbutzim. Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion finally asked the Mossad to investigate. Mossad Director-General Isser Harel assembled a team of forty agents, but due to their unfamiliarity with the traditions and nuances of Haredi life, they were swiftly unmasked in their attempts to infiltrate the Haredi world. As the search for Schumacher proved fruitless, Harel became convinced that the child had been smuggled abroad and was probably somewhere in Europe. Subsequently, the Mossad began searching for Schumacher internationally, and Harel moved his operations headquarters to a Mossad safe- house in Paris, and sent agents to infiltrate Haredi communities throughout France, Italy, Austria, and the United Kingdom, then expanded the search to South America and the United States, but their efforts to infiltrate these communities proved difficult. During their investigation, Mossad agents abducted Rabbi Shai Freyer, a teacher at the yeshiva Schumacher was studying in, as he traveled between Paris and Geneva. He refused to divulge anything during intense questioning, convincing the agents this was another dead end, but Harel ordered him held prisoner in a Mossad safe house in Switzerland (where he was beaten and tortured to try to divulge information but he wouldn't budge), until the end of the investigation to prevent him from alerting the Haredi community. After getting word that Mossad was searching for Schumacher, Blau took him first to Brussels and then to Paris, presenting the child as her daughter each time she traveled. From Paris, she smuggled Schumacher to the United States in March 1962 on a flight to New York City, where he was hidden in the apartment of a Haredi woman, Mrs. Gertner, at 126 Penn Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn in New York City. The family gave Schumacher the name Yankele Frenkel and kept him indoors, holding him from the time he arrived in March until August 1962. As they combed potential suspects in the Haredi world, Mossad investigators found a potential lead in Ruth Blau. Checks showed that she was a regular visitor to Israel, where she spent time with members of Neturei Karta, had met Yossele's grandfather on several occasions, and that her last visit to Israel was around the same time of the abduction. Focusing their investigation on her, the agents traced Blau, who was still in France, to the outskirts of Paris. At this time, Blau had decided to sell her house, and in August 1962 met a potential real estate agent named \\"Mr. Faber\\" in an attorney's office. The real estate agent was in fact Harel, who interrogated her over the abduction. Though uncooperative at first, Blau began to talk after she was told that Schumacher was cooperating with them. With Schumacher's location identified, two Shin Bet officials went to the Gertners' home in Brooklyn and requested the immigration papers of Yankele Frenkel. No papers were presented and the agents took Schumacher from the house, and his mother arrived from Israel to retrieve him several days later. Controversy The abduction of Yossele Schumacher caused enormous controversy among Jewish society within Israel, driving a divide between many Haredi Jews -- who supported the grandparents and claimed that the government was only working on this case as a direct fight with the Haredi, and therefore the matter was much more controversial and hot topic at the time. Many Secular Jews yelled Epho Yossele? (\\"Where is Yossele?\\" in Hebrew) in Jerusalem, turning to the more haredi neighbourhoods and terrorizing the Jews living there, as the phrase had previously been used by Haredi Jews that supported Schumacher's grandparents to taunt police searching for Schumacher both in Israel and internationally. The search itself was also an object of controversy, as Harel was criticized for his focus on this case at the expense of manhunts for Nazi officials, notably by then Aman director Major General Meir Amit and even from the Israeli spy Peter Malkin. Later developments Yossele Schumacher returned to his family, which at the time was living in Holon. At first, he attended a religious school but was later sent to a secular school. In 1969, he was chairman of the Holon Youth Parliament.http://jpress.org.il/Olive/APA/NLI_Heb/SharedView.Article.aspx?parm=%2FZBcyTM2efPLRDKhPPbd2iy3hqoMqVqPLjJ%2FLQZEJoEcwu9l%2Bkiy%2B%2BqwkG%2FfaNUvYw%3D%3D&mode;=image&href;=MAR%2f1969%2f11%2f18&page;=7&rtl;=true He was conscripted into the Israel Defense Forces in 1970, and served as an officer in the Artillery Corps.

After the debt was paid with the help of the club's supporters, on January 7, 2002, Juazeiro was refounded as Associa√ß√£o Desportiva Recreativa Cultural Icasa. In 2003, the club won the Campeonato Cearense Second Level. Icasa competed again in the S√©rie C in 2005, where they were eliminated in the second stage, in 2006, again Icasa was eliminated in the second stage, in 2007, the club was eliminated in the first stage. Icasa competed in the 2008 S√©rie C, where they were eliminated in the second stage, but as one of the four best clubs eliminated in that stage, Icasa qualified to compete in the following season's S√©rie C. In 2009, the club was promoted to S√©rie B. They won the Copa Integra√ß√£o in 2007, 2008, and in 2009.

Champagne has had a long history of being used in celebration of events such as the launching of ships. The history of Champagne has seen the wine evolve from being a pale, pinkish still wine to the sparkling wine now associated with the region. The Romans were the first to plant vineyards in this area of northeast France, with the region being cultivated by at least the 5th century, possibly earlier. When Hugh Capet was crowned King of France in 987 at the cathedral of Reims, located in the heart of the region, he started a tradition that brought successive monarchs to the region‚Äîwith the local wine being on prominent display at the coronation banquets. The early wine of the Champagne region was a pale, pinkish wine made from Pinot noir.J. Robinson (ed). The Oxford Companion to Wine, Third Edition. pp 150‚Äì153. Oxford University Press, 2006. . The Champenois were envious of the reputation of the wines made from their Burgundian neighbours to the south and sought to produce wines of equal acclaim. However the northerly climate of the region gave the Champenois a unique set of challenges in making red wine. At the far extremes of sustaining viticulture, the grapes would struggle to ripen fully and often would have bracing levels of acidity and low sugar levels. The wines were lighter bodied and thinner than the Burgundies. Furthermore, the cold winter temperatures prematurely halted fermentation in the cellars, leaving dormant yeast cells that would awaken in the warmth of spring and start fermenting again. One of the byproducts of fermentation is the release of carbon dioxide gas, which, if the wine is bottled, is trapped inside the wine, causing intense pressure. The pressure inside the weak, early French wine bottles often caused the bottles to explode, creating havoc in the cellars. If the bottle survived, the wine was found to contain bubbles, something that the early Champenois were horrified to see, considering it a fault. As late as the 17th century, Champenois wine makers, most notably the Benedictine monk Dom P√©rignon (1638‚Äì1715), were still trying to rid their wines of the bubbles. While the Champenois and their French clients preferred their Champagne to be pale and still, the British were developing a taste for the unique bubbly wine. The sparkling version of Champagne continued to grow in popularity, especially among the wealthy and royal. Following the death of Louis XIV of France in 1715, the court of Philippe II, Duke of Orl√©ans made the sparkling version of Champagne a favorite among the French nobility. More Champenois wine makers attempted to make their wines sparkle deliberately, but didn't know enough about how to control the process or how to make wine bottles strong enough to withstand the pressure. In the 19th century these obstacles were overcome, and the modern Champagne wine industry took form. Advances by the house of Veuve Clicquot in the development of the m√©thode champenoise made production of sparkling wine on a large scale profitable, and this period saw the founding of many of today's famous Champagne houses, including Krug (1843), Pommery (1858) and Bollinger (1829). The fortunes of the Champenois and the popularity of Champagne grew until a series of setbacks in the early 20th century. Phylloxera appeared, vineyard growers rioted in 1910‚Äì11, the Russian and American markets were lost because of the Russian Revolution and Prohibition, and two World Wars made the vineyards of Champagne a battlefield. The modern era, however, has seen a resurgence of the popularity of Champagne, a wine associated with both luxury and celebration, with sales quadrupling since 1950. Today the region's produces over 200 million bottles of Champagne with worldwide demand prompting the French authorities to look into expanding the region's Appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e (AOC) zone to facilitate more production. Early history The Romans were the first known inhabitants to plant vineyards in the Champagne region. The name Champagne comes from the Latin campania and referred to the similarities between the rolling hills of the province and the Italian countryside of Campania located south of Rome. The area was divided into the Champagne pouilleuse‚Äîthe chalky, barren plains east of Reims‚Äîand Champagne viticole, the forested hillside region known as the Montagne de Reims between Reims and the Marne river where the vines were planted. While vineyards were undoubtedly planted earlier, the first recorded vineyard belonged to St. Remi in the 5th century. For most of the region's early history, the wines from Champagne were not known as \\"Champagne\\" or even vin de Champagne. Rather they were known as vins de Reims and vins de la riv√®re in reference to the Marne river which provided a vital trade route via the Seine with Paris. Champagne's location at the crossroads of two major trading routes, one east‚Äìwest between Paris and the Rhineland and the other north‚Äìsouth between Flanders and Switzerland, would bring the region and its wines much prosperity and notoriety but would also play a pivotal role in Champagne being the site of countless battles and occupations. The coronation of Hugh Capet in Reims started a tradition that would associate the region, and its wines, with royalty. In 987, Hugh Capet was crowned King of France at the cathedral Reims. At the coronation banquet, the local wines of the regions were served. The city became known as the spiritual capital of France and for the next eight centuries, monarchs would follow the tradition of Capet and hold their coronations in Reims. The association of the region with royalty did much to further the reputation of the region's wine. By the 16th century, the village of Ay, located south of Reims, was widely acclaimed for the quality of its wine with King Francis I proclaiming himself to be the \\"Roi d' A√ø et de Gonesse\\"‚ÄîKing of the lands where the country's greatest wines and flour were produced. Such was the reputation of the wines of Ay that they were known as the vins de France, their quality representing the whole of the country rather than just a region. Eventually the name of Ay became a shorthand reference to refer to all the wines of the Champagne region. (Much like Bordeaux or Beaune is used today to refer to the wines of the Gironde and Burgundy regions, respectively.)H. Johnson Vintage: The Story of Wine pp 210‚Äì219 Simon and Schuster 1989 During the Middle Ages, the wines of the Champagne region were various shades of light red to pale pink as a bitter rivalry developed between the Champenois and their Burgundian neighbors to the south. The trade route that Flemish merchants used to get to the Burgundy went right through Reims and the Champenois were eager to entice their business with a \\"cheaper\\" alternative. Unfortunately the climate of the region made it difficult to produce red wines with the richness and color of the Burgundian wines, even though the Champenois tried to \\"improve\\" their wines by blending in elderberries. Eventually their attention moved to produce white wines in an attempt to distinguish themselves from their Burgundian rivals. However, the white wine produced from white grapes were found to have a dull flavor and quickly spoiled. The most sought after wines were those \\"white wines\\" made from red wine grapes, such as Pinot noir which had more flavor, aromatics and longevity. Throughout the 16th and early 17th century, Champenois winemakers tried to produce the best \\"white\\" wine they could from red wines grapes though the results were often not white at all but ranged from greyish color to a shade of pink known as oeil de perdrix or partridge eye. It wasn't until a Benedictine monk named Dom Pierre Perignon from the Abbey of Hautvillers perfected his techniques would the Champenois be able to truly make white wine from red grapes. =Dom P√©rignon= Even though he spent most of his career trying to rid his Champagne of bubbles, Dom P√©rignon's pioneering techniques used to make white wine from red wine grapes would influence the development of modern sparkling Champagne. After being destroyed during the French Wars of Religion, the Benedictine Abbey at Hautvillers was rebuilt and replanted its vineyards. By 1661, the Abbey had of vineyards, but was also receiving tithes in the form of grapes from nearby villages, including the highly regarded vineyards of Ay and Avenay-Val-d'Or. The Abbot commissioned the construction of a cellar and sought to hire a treasurer and cellar master to help develop the Abbey's growing winemaking operation. In 1668, Pierre Perignon was appointed to the position. Described by his predecessor, Dom Groussard, and Canon Godinot as a perfectionist, Perignon worked diligently to improve the viticultural practices of Abbey's vineyards and the quality of the wines. He was a strong advocate of using only Pinot noir grapes which he believed had the best flavor and potential quality. At the time, the vineyards of the region were planted with a variety of grapes including Pinot noir, Chasselas, Pinot blanc, Pinot gris, Pinot Meunier and perhaps Chardonnay. Most important, in Dom P√©rignon's mind, was that red grapes like Pinot noir were less likely to become \\"volatile\\" in the spring and produce bubbles as the white grapes sometimes did. The presence of bubbles in his wines was considered a fault and Dom P√©rignon set out to develop precise techniques to limit the likelihood of this fault occurring. Dom P√©rignon was a staunch advocate of aggressive pruning, dictating that vines should grow no higher than and produce small yields. Harvesting was to be done early in the morning, when it was very cool, and every care was to be taken to keep the grapes intact. Grapes that were bruised or broken were rejected. Mules and donkeys were favored over horses to transport the grapes to the press houses since they were less likely to get excited and possibly damage the grapes. Dom P√©rignon desired the grapes to be pressed as quickly and efficiently as possible to minimize the possibility of the grapeskins leaching into the juice. A distinction was made between the different levels of pressings. The first press, done completely by the weight of the grapes on top of each other, produced the highest quality wine, known as the vin de goutte. The second and third pressings, done with weight being applied, produced wine of good but not exceptional quality. The fourth and fifth pressings, the vin de taille and vins de pressoir, were of darker colors and would not be used at all. In addition to adding the pinkish/grey coloring, Dom P√©rignon knew that the skins imparted different flavoring and coarser textures than he wanted in his high quality wines. His emphasis on limiting skin contact helped the Abbey of Hautvillers to produce truly white wine from red wine grapes. English influences While banished to England, the Marquis de Saint-√âvremond did much to popularize Champagne in London society. While Saint-√âvremond preferred his Champagne to be still, the sparkling version of Champagne soon became popular with the English. As a wealthy and powerful nation with limited winemaking resources, England had a marked influence on the development of sparkling Champagne. Non-sparkling Champagne became popular in London society following the arrival of epicurean Charles de Saint-√âvremond in 1661. At parties and banquets, Saint-√âvremond feverishly promoted the wines of the Champagne region. Soon some of the most powerful and fashionable men of London, such as the Duke of Bedford and the Duke of Buckingham as well as the Earl of Arlington were making regular orders of cases of Champagne. The wine was non-sparkling, or at least it was intended to be. Wine was often transported to England in wooden wine barrels and merchant houses would then bottle the wine for sale. During the 17th century, English glassmakers used coal-fueled ovens and produced stronger, more durable glass bottles than wood- fired French glass. The English also rediscovered the use of cork stoppers, once used by the Romans but forgotten for centuries after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. During the cold winters of the Champagne region, temperatures would drop so low that the fermentation process was prematurely halted, leaving some residual sugar and dormant yeast. When the wine was shipped to and bottled in England, the fermentation process would restart when the weather warmed and the cork-stoppered wine would begin to build pressure from carbon dioxide gas. When the wine was opened, it would be bubbly.T. Stevenson, ed. The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia (4th Edition) pp 169‚Äì178 Dorling Kindersley 2005 The English were among the first who saw the tendency of Champagne to sparkle as a desirable trait, and tried to understand why it did bubble. In 1662, the English scientist Christopher Merret presented a paper detailing how the presence of sugar in a wine led to it eventually sparkling, and that nearly any wine could be made to sparkle by adding sugar to a wine before bottling it. This is one of the first known accounts of understanding the process of sparkling wine and suggests that British merchants were producing \\"sparkling Champagne\\" even before the French Champenois were deliberately making it. Concurrently, advances in glass manufacture in Britain, by George Ravenscroft and others, allowed more robust wine bottle to be made which could contain the effervescence without exploding.S. Clarke. 1000 Years of Annoying the French p179 Bantam Press 2010 The popularity of sparkling Champagne steadily grew. In 1663, the British poet Samuel Butler penned the first written English reference to \\"brisk\\" (i.e. frothy) Champagne in his poem Hudibras. The 1698 George Farquhar play Love and a Bottle featured one of the characters marveling at the steady stream of bubbles in a glass of a Champagne. As the popularity of sparkling Champagne grew in London, other European courts began to discover the bubbly curiosity- including the French who had previously despised the bubbles as a wine fault. Growing popularity of sparkling Champagne During his regency, Philippe II, Duke of Orl√©ans helped popularize sparkling Champagne among the French nobility. Following the death of Louis XIV in 1715, his nephew Philippe II, Duke of Orl√©ans became the Regent of France. The Duke of Orl√©ans enjoyed the sparkling version of Champagne and featured it at his nightly petits soupers at the Palais-Royal. This sparked a craze in Paris as restaurants and fashionable society sought to emulate the Duke's tastes for the bubbling wine. Champenois winemakers began to switch their business from making still wines to sparkling in order to capitalize on this craze. Throughout the 18th century, Champagne houses opened up-creating a new business dynamic in the Champagne region. Rather than single estate growers or monasteries producing the majority of wine, private houses or merchants who bought grapes from vineyard owners to make Champagne came to dominate. The houses of Mo√´t & Chandon, Louis Roederer, Piper-Heidsieck and Taittinger were some of the major houses that were founded during this period. Each house hired sales agents to bring samples of their wine to royal courts across Europe as they competed with each other for shares of the growing Champagne market.H. Johnson Vintage: The Story of Wine pp 330‚Äì341 Simon and Schuster 1989 However, by the end of the 18th century non-sparkling pinkish wine production still accounted for over 90% of the Champagne region's production. The French Revolution and following Napoleonic wars temporarily derailed the popularity surge for Champagne. To save some of their noble clients from the guillotine, Champagnes merchants altered business records by replacing the titles of their clients with \\"Citizen\\". As many nobles fled to other countries, the merchants did their best to make sure cases of their favorite Champagne followed. During the Napoleonic wars, Europeans ports were subject to an endless stream of blockading and counter-blockading. Sales agents like Louis Bohne of Veuve Clicquot devised creative schemes to smuggle their wines to their clients. The agents even tried to turn both victory and defeat into sales opportunities. During Napoleon's invasion of Russia, Charles-Henri Heidsieck traveled by horseback ahead of the French Imperial Army on their way to Moscow. Armed with cases of Champagne, Heidsieck was prepared to do business with whoever was the victor. After the defeat of Napoleon, the Champagne region itself was occupied by Russian forces. During the occupation, Champagne was used as requisition and tribute. As her cellar was being emptied of her wine, the Widow Cliquot is reported to have said \\"Today they drink. Tomorrow they will pay\\". Her words would be prophetic because for the next century, until the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Russian empire would be the second largest consumer of Champagne in the world.D. and P. Kladstrup Champagne: How the World's Most Glamorous Wine Triumphed Over War and Hard Times (New York: William Morrow, 2005), pp 83‚Äì84. . Development of the modern Champagne industry The roots of the modern Champagne industry were laid during the Industrial Revolution which saw vast leaps in understanding the method of making sparkling wine and improvements in the technology needed to make production more financially feasible. The French scientist Jean-Antoine Chaptal popularized the understanding that Champagne sparkled because it was sealed in a bottle before fermentation was complete. He further noted that it was the sugar in the wine that facilitated this fermentation process resulting in bubbles. Along with the bubbles came intense pressure from the carbon dioxide gas that could result in the bottles exploding. The disturbance caused by one bottle's disintegration could cause a chain reaction, with it being routine for cellars to lose 20‚Äì90% of their bottles to instability.D. & P. Kladstrup Champagne pp 46‚Äì47 Harper Collins Publisher The British method of coal fired glassmaking contributed to stronger wine bottles being available that could withstand the pressure of the carbon dioxide gas better. In the 1830s, a pharmacist from Ch√¢lons-sur-Marne named Andr√© Fran√ßois outlined formulas with precise measurements of how much sugar is needed to make a wine sparkle without producing more pressure than the wine bottle could withstand. Corking machines and improved corks made sealing the wine easier with less opportunity for the precious gas to seep out of the bottle. The development of riddling as a means of removing sediment from Champagne without losing much gas was a significant advancement in improving the quality of Champagne production. An important advance made in the early 19th century was developing a technique to remove the sediment caused by dead yeast after the secondary fermentation. Early Champagne producers chose not to remove the sediment, which left the wine cloudy and prone to off flavors if the sediment was shaken up or poured into the glass. At royal courts and banquets, servers would pour new serving of Champagne into a fresh glass to avoid the residue of sediment left over in the previous glass. To remove the sediments, some producers would decant the wine by pouring it a new bottle. However this process caused a considerable amount of carbon dioxide gas to escape and the resulting wine was noticeably less bubbly. With the aid of her cellar master, Madame Clicquot of the Champagne house Veuve Cliquot developed the process of riddling in the early 19th century to solve the problem of sediments without losing much gas. This technique, which involves collecting the sediment in the neck of the bottle and using the pressure of the wine to eject just the sediment, led to the popularity of adding sugar-sweet dosage to replace the wine lost during riddling. The Russians, in particular, were fans of very sweet Champagne and Veuve Cliquot was able to tailor the sweetness level of their wines for their customers by the composition of their dosage. At first the house of Veuve Cliquot tried to keep this technique of riddling a secret but by the late 1820s the secret was out and Champagne houses were settling up production lines for riddling. In 1854, the French national railroad system linked Reims with the rest of the country, including its coastal ports. From that point on, Champagne was connected to its worldwide market and sales grew by leaps and bounds. During the 1850s production was averaging 20 million bottles a year. =From sweet to brut= Throughout most of the 19th century Champagne was made sweet. The taste was pleasing to most wine drinkers and the added sugar helped winemakers to cover up flaws in the wine or poor quality from less desirable grapes. Champagne houses would use the dosage to tailor the sweetness to whatever style was in fashion in a particular market. The Russians preferred the sweetest level with as much as 250‚Äì330 grams of sugar added. Scandinavia was next at around 200 grams followed by France at 165 grams, Germany with slightly more, and the United States preferring between 110‚Äì165 grams. The English preferred the driest style at 22‚Äì66 grams of sugar. Gradually tastes developed to favor less sweetness and higher overall quality in the Champagne. The first slightly dry Champagne to emerged was labeled demi-sec or \\"half dry\\". The success of those wines prompted the introduction of sec or dry wines. Other producers made wines with even less sugar and began to call these wines extra dry. In 1846, the Champagne house Perrier-Jou√´t introduced a wine that was made without any added sugar. This style was initially ill-received with critics calling this wine too severe, or brute- like. But over the next generation, this \\"brut\\" style with significantly less sugar than wines labeled extra dry became the fashion for Champagne and today is the modern style that the majority of Champagne is made in.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pp 164‚Äì165 Workman Publishing 2001 From the late 19th century to modern day What constituted \\"Champagne\\" and where the grapes were grown was a source of significant tension in the early 20th century when riots broke out in villages like Damery (pictured). By the end of the 19th century, Champagne was making its mark and embedding itself into popular culture. The early 20th century brought its share of challenges. Some of the seeds of these challenges were planted during the century before when Champagne's growing popularity encouraged Champagne houses to look outside the Champagne region for a cheaper supply of grapes. The French railway system made it easy for truckloads of grapes from the Loire Valley or Languedoc to be transported to Champagne at prices nearly half of what the houses were paying Champenois vine growers for their grapes. Newspapers published rumors of some houses buying rhubarb from England to make wine from. With hardly any laws in place to protect the vine grower or the consumer, Champagne houses had most of the power in the region to profit off of these faux Champagnes. To compound the misery for Champenois vine growers, the last few vintages of the 19th century were difficult with frost and rains severely reducing the crop yields. The phylloxera epidemic that ravaged vineyards across France was finally making its way to Champagne. The harvests between 1902 and 1909 were further troubled by mold and mildew. The 1910 vintages was particularly troublesome with hailstorms and flooding. Nearly 96% of the crop was lost.D. & P. Kladstrup Champagne pp 129‚Äì151 Harper Collins Publisher In 1917 Russia, the October Revolution saw massive prohibition of Champagne as an imported beverage. Based on Karl Marx's communist manifesto, a class system of beverages was instituted into Russian life. Gone were the days of Champagne and imported luxury beverages, in was the drink of the proletariat, Vodka. A drink for the Russian populace, by the Russian populace without foreign interference. \\"–î–∞ –∑–¥—Ä–∞–≤—Å—Ç–≤—É–µ—Ç –Ω–∞—à–∞ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∞—è –∑–µ–º–ª—è\\" or \\"Long live our Russian Land\\" in English, could be heard from beer hall to beer hall as victorious party members celebrated the fall of the Tsars. These sanctions were eventually eased during the 1970s with the de- stalinization efforts of Nikita Khrushchev's successor government. Ultimately, Champagne saw its mass introduction back into the Russian beverage scene with the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1991. Collusion was practiced among various Champagne houses in order to drive down the prices of grapes to as a low as they would go, with the ever-present threat that if the houses could not get their grapes for cheap enough they would continue to source grapes from outside the region. Champenois vineyard owners found themselves in a situation where they were being paid less for fewer grapes. Poverty was widespread. In January 1911, frustrations reached their boiling point as riots erupted in the towns of Damery and Hautvilliers. Champenois vine growers intercepted trucks with grapes from the Loire Valley and pushed them into the Marne river. They then descended upon the warehouses of producers known to produce faux Champagne, tossing more wine and barrels into the Marne. The French Government tried to answer the vine growers' concerns by passing legislation defining where Champagne wine was to come from. This early legislation dictated that the Marne department and a few villages from the Aisne department were the only areas approved to grow grapes for Champagne production. The glaring exclusion of the Aube region, where the historic capital of Champagne‚ÄîTroyes‚Äîis located, promoted further discontent as the Aubois protested the decision. The Aube, located south of the Marne, was closer to the Burgundy region in terms of soil and location. The growers of the Marne viewed the region as \\"foreign\\" and not capable of producing true Champagne but the Aubois viewed themselves as Champenois and clung to their historical roots. The government eventually reversed themselves and included the Aube- much to the dismay of vine growers in the Marne who vigorously protested the decision. More riots erupted and the region was on the brink of civil war. As the government fumbled for an answer that would appease both parties, World War I erupted and those issues had to be set aside as the entire country braced itself for war. =World War I and II= During the bombardment of German artillery of World War I, many Champenois took refuge in the caves used for Champagne storage. Despite the war, Champagne production continued in these caves. The strategic location of Champagne near the Western Front led to Champagne wines crossing the lines into no man's land. While several Champagne houses and vineyards were abandoned, many Champenois remained and took shelter in the underground cray√®res or limestone caverns where Champagne is often aged, to escape the bombardment from German artillery. The famous Reims Cathedral was virtually destroyed by the Germans along with many other buildings in the region. Vineyards became a wasteland of pits and bomb craters as several battles and offensives were waged on the land. Still some Champenois forged on in producing Champagne during the difficult vintages of World War I (1914‚Äì1917). By the time the war ended the Champagne region had lost over half its population with the Aisne region alone losing nearly two thirds. Champagne production and warehouses were completely destroyed, as were many vineyards.D. & P. Kladstrup Champagne pp 179‚Äì203, 213 Harper Collins Publisher The devastation of the war did bring a silver lining. In 1919, the French government passed a series of laws that would lay the groundwork for the Appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e (AOC) system that would strictly define winemaking laws and regional boundaries. Measures were taken to eliminate fraud and illegal additives such as rhubarb and apple juice. Only grapes grown from the delineated Champagne region, which would eventually include the Aube, could be legally called \\"Champagne\\". The decimation of the region's vineyards provided the opportunity for vine growers to replant with phylloxera resistant rootstock and in more ideal locations for quality grape production.D. & P. Kladstrup Champagne pp 223‚Äì224 Harper Collins Publisher But amidst this silver lining, more dark clouds would emerge as the full effects of the Russian Revolution hit home and the lucrative Russian market was closed to Champagne imports. The 1920 declaration of prohibition in the United States closed off yet another market and the global economic downturn of the Great Depression lead to a further decrease in sales. World War II would bring more troops marching through the vineyards of Champagne. While the devastation brought to the region was not as severe as the previous war, World War II was still a troubling time for the region. It was in Reims, on May 7, 1945 that the German military commander Alfred Jodl offered an unconditional surrender to the Supreme Allied Commander, General Dwight D. Eisenhower. The following morning, the signing was celebrated with 6 cases of the 1934 vintage of Pommery. Wine historians Don and Petie Kladstrup noted that a World War II historian would later comment that \\"the last explosions of the war were the popping of Champagne corks\\".D. & P. Kladstrup Champagne pp 228‚Äì253 Harper Collins Publisher =To the modern day= In modern times, Champagne has become more than just a wine but also a brand that has seen many imitators. Following World War II, the sales and popularity of Champagne surged once more. Since 1950, sales have grown steadily, quadrupling in total to over 200 million bottles. The increase in worldwide demand has prompted the French authorities to look into expanding the region's AOC zone to facilitate more production. In 2008, this expansion was approved and 40 more villages were added to Champagne production (while delisting 2 village) to increase the AOC by about 30%. There still exist the business dynamic between vine growers and Champagne houses with majority of the region's 19,000 growers selling their grapes to the nearly 300 Champagne houses in production. Over time Champagne has become not only a reflection of the terroir of the Champagne region but also a brand in itself, with the Champenois vigorously defending that brand and the uses of the term \\"Champagne\\". The popularity and success of Champagne has inspired many imitators around the world (such as Cava in Spain, Sekt in Germany and several American sparklers) but also within France itself with sparkling Cremants. The name \\"Champagne\\" is a protected designation of origin in the European Union and all wines produced and sold in the EU must conform to those standards and not label a wine as \\"Champagne\\" unless it comes from the Champagne AOC (in the United States there is a legal loophole for semi- generic terms). In 1985, use of the term m√©thode champenoise was also outlawed with producers of \\"champagne style\\" sparkling wine opting to uses phrases like m√©thode traditionnelle to signify that their wine is made using the same production methods as Champagne. Like many industries, due to COVID-19 and the various implications, the Champagne industry has taken a hit in regards to saleshttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/champagne-sales-down-covid-pandemic-social- distancing/https://www.euronews.com/2020/07/31/global-pandemic-knocks-down- champagne-sales-by-an- estimated-1-7-billionhttps://www.voanews.com/covid-19-pandemic/champagne- losing-its-fizz-global-pandemic-clobbers-sales References Category:Champagne (wine) Category:Sparkling wines Champagne ","title":"History of Champagne"},{"id":"20718153","text":"Yevgeny Borisovich Samsonov (, 15 September 1926 ‚Äì 30 September 2014–°–∫–æ–Ω—á–∞–ª—Å—è –∑–∞—Å–ª—É–∂–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π —Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–µ—Ä –°–°–°–† –ø–æ –∞–∫–∞–¥–µ–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π –≥—Ä–µ–±–ª–µ –ï–≤–≥–µ–Ω–∏–π –°–∞–º—Å–æ–Ω–æ–≤ (in Russian)) was a Russian rower who competed for the Soviet Union in the 1952 Summer Olympics and in the 1956 Summer Olympics.

A typical height for males of 60-70 cm has been reported. Males have three-tined antlers. Their fawns are spotted at birth, which separates them from the best known western population of the hog deer (H. porcinus). Due to ongoing habitat loss, small population size and limited range, the Bawean deer is evaluated as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix I of CITES. It has few natural enemies except for birds of prey and large snakes such as pythons. Life history Bawean deer reside on the Bawean island in Indonesia, close to the Java Sea. The Bawean deer is sometimes included with the Indian hog deer Hyelaphus porcinus , but it is a totally different species. The most recent analyses indicate that these two species, together with Axis calamianensis, constitute a different genus distinct from Axis and Hyelaphus. They live in woodlands and upland forests with dense undergrowth which is used for shelter, providing a refuge in which the deer sleep and rest during the day. They live in small groups of four or five deer, usually one female, her infant, and two males. They are herbivores and consume grasses, herbs, leaves, twigs, corn crops, and leaves of the cassave plant. Their pelage is short, smooth, and soft, and generally a light brown in color. There are few distinctive yellow markings which are limited to the head and neck. There is also a light throat patch or 'bib' and a whitish eye-ring. Infants have white spots on their backs when younger. Females will have one offspring at a time per year. The gestation period is 225‚Äì230 days, and the majority of births occur in February to June. Males can be very aggressive towards other males that approach their small families, and will spray other males and predators in the face with their glandular secretions. They also mark their territories with this as well.Regional Office of Endangered Species, Eastside Fed. Complex, 911 NE 11th Ave. Portland Oregon 97232, When fleeing, the Bawean deer carries its head low and runs with a trotting gait. Their spine also curves high towards the rear when fleeing from predators. When fleeing from predators the males will run in front and the infant, if there is one, will be behind the males. The female will run in the back. This is effective in order to protect the infant from predators.Edinburgh Zoo and Highland Wildlife Park, The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom, EH12 6TES Conservation threats Their past extinction was due to tigers‚Äîprecisely, the Balinese tiger‚Äîand humans hunting them for their antlers and pelts. Their main predators now are humans, leopards, dholes (the Asiatic wild dog), pythons, and crocodiles. Another cause for population decline is human related habitat loss. The land on which the deer live is cleared for agriculture and buildings. Conservation efforts The World Wildlife Fund has noted that some of the factors for the decline of this species and others in Indonesia include climate changes: warming ocean temperatures, rising sea levels, prolonged droughts, and increased flooding. The Indonesian government passed a bill in 1977 protecting the endangered Bawean deer, and consequently their numbers have risen. With the help of this law their reproductive success has gone up over the years. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the Kuhl's hog deer as being critically endangered, meaning that the species is facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild.

It encases several northern regions: Oshana Region, Kavango East Region, Omusati Region, Zambezi Region, Omaheke Region, Kunene Region, and parts of Khomas Region and Oshikoto Region.Miescher, Giorgio. Namibia's Red Line: The History of a Veterinary and Settlement Border, Palgrave MacMillan, 2012, p. 170 South of the fence today there commercial farms where the farmers, many of which are white, own the land. Most of these farms are fenced in and are accessible by constructed farm roads. North of the line, on the other hand, all farm land is communal and operated mostly by black farmers. Livestock is not constrained by fences and often ventures onto roads. The red line is a highly guarded line which has roadblocks to check every vehicle which passes. History The demarcation was created in 1896 in the hope to contain a Rinderpest outbreak in the Imperial German colony of South West Africa. Fort Namutoni was built as a Police station to control north-south travel of the indigenous population and their livestock; the line went further to Okaukuejo in the west and Otjituuo in the east. Nevertheless, the epidemic reached Windhoek in 1897, wiping out half of the cattle population of the OvaHerero people. Its name stems from the depiction in red ink on a 1911 map created by the German colonial administration. The Red Line was changed several times and was since the 1960s also used to isolate Foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks in the North from the farms in the South.  Removing the Redline  Livestock north of the Red Line may not be sold overseas, while farmers in the South can sell their meat anywhere. The issues of the red line restrictions have become controversial amidst a 2008 meat market boom. Since the Independence of Namibia in the 1990s, the government has been fighting to remove the Red Line and allow prosperity in these regions. It has been working to build infrastructure, deconcentrate farms and promote the building of farms on virgin lands. Since this line has been deeply embedded in political and historical issues, the government has proposed uprooting it to the Angolan border. This has some concerned that the disease will spread to uninfected areas but areas like Kunene have not had outbreaks in over 30 years and are advocating for this line movement.

He served under several political regimes including that of Charles IV King of Hungary, Regent Mikl√≥s Horthy, Prime Minister P√°l Teleki, and Arrow Cross Party leader Ferenc Sz√°lasi. His service through the end of the World War II resulted in controversies within Hungary that followed him until his death. Scouting and Officers Training School In 1933, he was chief organizer and General Camp Manager of the 4th World Scout Jamboree hosted by the Hungarian Boy Scouts at G√∂d√∂ll≈ë, Hungary, alongside Hungary's Chief Scout and future Prime Minister P√°l Teleki. A Catholic, in 1938 Farkas was the chief organizer of a World Eucharistic Congress in Budapest on May 25‚Äì29, 1938, at which time he created a lifelong relationship with the Pope and the Vatican. In the same year he assumed command of the Royal Ludovika Akademia :hu:Ludovika Akad√©mia (officer training school) which had been founded in 1872. Among the officers he brought to the Akad√©mia was 21-year-old B√©la B√°n√°thy, whom Farkas had met as a 14-year-old youth at the 1933 Jamboree. He requested a volunteer to teach leadership at the academy, and B√°n√°thy was selected. He also asked B√°n√°thy to organize a Scout Troop for the young men, 19 years and older, which was a common practice within the Hungarian Scout Association at the time. Farkas served as commander of the Royal Ludovika Akad√©mia through 1943. Banathy served most of the war under Farkas and when it ended, escaped first to Austria and later the United States. He was inspired by his attendance at the 4th World Jamboree where he met Farkas and his Scouting experience teaching leadership at the Ludovika Akad√©mia. In 1958 he founded the White Stag Leadership Development Program in Monterey, California, which has continually taught leadership to youth since then. Chief Scout of Hungary A lifelong supporter of Scouting, Farkas in June 1941 became Chief Scout of Hungary, upon Prime Minister P√°l Teleki's suicide and on the eve of Hungary's forced entry into World War II. Under political pressure from the extreme right, the Hungarian Scouting movement became more militaristic and nationalistic between 1941 and 1945. Despite the war, the Hungarian national Scout leadership was able until the end of 1943 to maintain contact with the Boy Scouts International Bureau, the Polish Scout Headquarters in exile, and with Prince Gustav Adolf of Sweden, Chief Scout of Sweden and member of the World Scout Committee. Before the end of World War II, the national Hungarian Scouts were ordered to merge with the extremist right-leaning youth organization Hungarista √ñrszem, but the merger was never implemented. Farkas retained the title and role of Chief Scout through World War II. When the Soviet Union occupied the country and forbid organization of Scouting units, he remained Chief Scout of the Hungarian Scout Association in Exteris until his death in 1980. Commander of Hungarian Sixth Army Corps In 1943 Farkas assumed command of the Hungarian Sixth Army, which had been garrisoned at Debrecen. During March 1944, Regent Mikl√≥s Horthy first set in motion plans for a new Hungarian government loyal to the Allies, but the effort was forestalled after German pressure by Edmund Veesenmayer, Hitler's personal emissary in Hungary. Ferenc Farkas was to have been minister of cultural affairs. In July 1944 he replaced General K√°roly Beregfy, an Arrow Cross Party member, and under Farkas' the Hungarian VI Army Corps beat back a Red Army attack across the Carpathian mountains, employing brutal methods to keep the Red Army from advancing. He became known as the heroic defender of the Tat√°r Pass in the Carpathian Mountains. =Secret negotiations to surrender= As the Soviets advanced on Budapest, the Sixth Army was ordered to Budapest on October 12 where Farkas was briefly named commander of the Pest bridgehead. Regent Mikl√≥s Horthy also wanted military units in Budapest commanded by officers he could trust, as he planned to announce an armistice with the Soviet Union as Romania had done, abandoning the lost Axis cause which he had never fully embraced. Germany feared the surrender of Hungary, knowing this would leave their entire southern flank open to Soviet attack. =Fall of Regent Horthy= Working through his trustworthy General B√©la Mikl√≥s who was in contact with Soviet forces in eastern Hungary, Regent Horthy attempted to negotiate the end of the war, seeking to surrender to the Soviets while preserving the government's autonomy. The Soviets willingly promised this. But the Germans were aware of Horthy's behind-the-scenes maneuvering and set in place Operation Panzerfaust which would remove him from power and replace his government with forces loyal to the German cause, effectively occupying Hungary. Horthy governed from Castle Hill in central Budapest, an ancient and now well-guarded fortress. At 2:00 p.m. on October 15, 1944, Horthy announced over the radio that Hungary had signed an armistice with the Soviet Union. \\"It is clear today that Germany has lost the war... Hungary has accordingly concluded a preliminary armistice with Russia, and will cease all hostilities against her.\\" Failing to receive official orders, the Hungarian army ignored the armistice, surprising the Germans. Given that many Hungarian units were controlled by the German army, it is unclear whether orders, if issued, ever reached most of the line troops. There had also been considerable propaganda about the harsh, punitive treatment of prisoners by the Soviets, and some Hungarian forces had witnessed first-hand the atrocities Soviet perpetrated against civilians. Combined with their loyalty to their country, no matter what government was in charge, they felt it was their duty to fight even when the end result was predictable. Horthy's son Mikl√≥s Horthy, Jr. at this father's direction went to a meeting with representatives from the Yugoslavian government to finalize the surrender of Hungary to the Soviets. Upon entering the building, he was attacked and beaten by German soldiers commanded by Waffen SS Major Otto Skorzeny, who had initiated the meeting as a ruse. They kidnapped Mikl√≥s at gunpoint, trussed him up in a carpet, and immediately drove him to the airport, where a flight was waiting to take him to Germany and a concentration camp. Skorzeny then brazenly led a convoy of Germany troops and four Tiger II tanks to the Vienna Gates of Castle Hill. Seeking to avoid unneeded bloodshed, and knowing his forces could not resist the superior German troops, the Regent ordered his soldiers to not resist. Only one unit did not get the order, and the Germans quickly and with minimal bloodshed captured Castle Hill. Only seven soldiers were killed and 26 men were wounded. Horthy was arrested by Waffen SS Brigadef√ºhrer Edmund Veesenmayer and held overnight in SS offices. Faced with an overt threat to his son's life, and having already been effectively removed from power, under coercion and as a prisoner of war, he abrogated the armistice, deposed Premier G√©za Lakatos' government, and named the leader of the fanatical Arrow Cross Party, Ferenc Sz√°lasi, as Prime Minister. Horthy was placed on a private train to Germany three days later. Skorzeny told Horthy that he would be a \\"guest of honor\\" in a secure Bavarian castle. Skorzeny personally escorted Horthy to his captivity, where he was held until the war ended. Service at end of war In the final months of the war, Farkas presided over the trial of fellow Lieutenant General Lajos Veres von Dalnoki (former commander of the Hungarian Second Army) and Captain K√°lm√°n Hardy (aide-de-camp to Horthy), who were charged by the Arrow Cross government with treason for having attempted to arrange a cease-fire or switching alliegience during the last days of the war. He sentenced both to death, though neither was executed. After Ferenc Sz√°lasi assumed power, Farkas was not dismissed despite his previous loyalty to Horthy, and he swore an oath to the new Prime Minister. K√°roly Beregfy, newly appointed on October 17, 1944 by the Arrow Cross government as Minister of War and Commander in Chief of the Hungarian Army, named Farkas as Government Commissioner for Evacuation, promoted him to General, and put him in charge of securing national treasures. He was later accused of sending to Austria about USD$3 billion in national treasures, \\"including the crown jewels, priceless gold treasures and the collection of national seals.\\" The crown jewels were in fact captured in Mattsee, Austria on 4 May 1945 by the U.S. 86th Infantry Division. The jewels were then transported to Western Europe and eventually given to the United States Army for safekeeping from the Soviet Union. For much of the Cold War, it was held at the United States Bullion Depository (Fort Knox, Kentucky) alongside the bulk of America's gold reserves and other priceless historical items. U.S. President Jimmy Carter ordered extensive historical research to verify the crown as genuine, and it was returned to the Hungarian people on January 6, 1978. None of the charges against Farkas relating to the expropriation of Hungarian treasures and seals was substantiated. Facing the imminent fall of the government and the nation, the Hungarian Defense Ministry named Farkas as the leader of a four-man committee which was charged with representing the Hungarian Army with the Allies after the war's end. General officers of the Hungarian Army who returned to Hungary under Communist rule were likely to be arrested and become Prisoners of War again, and face charges and possible execution. Farkas drove across Austria and France to General Patton's headquarters. Farkas was placed in a prisoner of war camp in Foucarville, near Sainte-M√®re-√âglise, Normandy, which housed 40,000 prisoners, including 218 generals and 6 admirals. Post World War II activitiesU.S. Army liaison= In October 1946, 26 other Hungarian Army generals in the Foucarville POW camp wrote a letter to the American military, requesting that Farkas be released. In January 1947 he became the U.S. liaison to Hungarian prisoners of war and assisted in resolving their displaced person status and living arrangements. He remained in Germany becoming the highest-ranking Hungarian officer to settle in a country controlled by the Allies. His war- time role in the Army, especially after the Arrow Cross Party assumed command, became very controversial within Hungary. Because of his actions in the camps against the Arrow Cross Party and Sz√°lasi's government, the Provisional Hungarian Government of 1945, led by the Soviet forces in Debrecen, reduced his former Army rank to a private. =P√°l Teleki Scout Association= While in the displaced persons camp, he founded the P√°l Teleki Scout Association, which in 1948 was renamed the Hungarian Scout Association in Exile, and after the fall of the Iron Curtain, the Hungarian Scout Association Abroad. He was named Training Camp Chief and later Chief Commissioner (Hungarian: Bodnar Gabor). He also led adult leader training for Hungarian Scout leaders in exile in several locations within Germany during the late 1940s, and later at numerous locations abroad. He recommended B√©la H. B√°n√°thy, a Hungarian Scout leader and one of his former officers with whom he had maintained a relationship, for a position as a Hungarian language instructor at the U.S. government's new Army Language School. During 1952, Farkas visited the United States and met with adult leaders at a training camp for Hungarian Scouts in Exile held in Buffalo, New York. He remained the Hungarian Chief Scout until his death in 1980. =Anti-Soviet activities= He was founder of a Hungarian veteran's organization for veterans in exile, the Magyar Harcosok Bajt√°rsi K√∂z√∂ss√©ge K√∂zpontja (World Federation of Hungarian Veterans). He suggested creating a fraternal organization to honor the officers, non-commissioned officers, and enlisted men who served in the Hungarian armed forces and were now in exile. He suggested to B√©la Almay, a former Lieutenant Colonel on the Hungarian General Staff, that he organize an association for Hungarian veterans, which became the Collegiate Society of Hungarian Veterans. Farkas also attempted with the support of former members of the Hungarian government who had escaped to the west before the war to establish a Hungarian government in exile, but was frustrated in his efforts by American Occupation Forces in Germany who forbid it. The veteran's organization retained as one of its purposes support for the restoration of a democratic government in Hungary. During 1947, the Americans and French permitted him to found the Anti-Bolshevik Hungarian Liberation Movement in Landshut, Germany. The movement initially called for a violent revolution in Hungary against Soviet control. It arranged for a member in exile to return to Hungary illegally and assess the situation and support for overthrow of the Communist government. What it learned was discouraging and the only hope the group held out for liberation of Hungary was Western help, which was not forthcoming. By 1950, Farkas was a leader of the reactionary, right-wing Anti-Bolshevik Bloc of Nations (ABN) which openly advocated the destruction of the Soviet Union and its fifth columnists. During the 1950 convention of the ABN, Farkas made an early prediction that the USSR would dissolve due to the pressures of its internal non-Russian nationalities.National Library of Scotland, Edinburgh.

Accessed 06 August 2014. Conviction, death, and restoration When World War II ended and for several years afterward, the Communist government organized and encouraged the arrest and execution of those they blamed for the deprivations the war visited upon the Hungarian population. These arrests and prosecutions were in many instances politically motivated and the legal process was later found to lack the minimum requirements for legal action. Farkas was convicted in absentia by the Budapest High Court of the Hungarian Communist government on March 30, 1950 and was stripped of his rank and sentenced to life imprisonment. He visited the United States and Canada during 1955 and met with Hungarian Scouts in exile. In 1962, he was named General Captain (Hungarian: F√µkapit√°ny) of The Knightly Order of Vit√©z, a role in which he continued to serve through 1977. He also continued his involvement with Scouting both locally and internationally, serving as Chief Scout of Hungary for the Hungarian Scout Association Abroad. He died in Arnstorf, Germany on April 14, 1980. In late 1998, the Hungarian Republic Supreme Court found serious legal and procedural errors in his original 1950 trial and on December 7, 1998 rescinded the sentence, nullifying its results. On September 15, 2006, the Hungarian Defence Ministry's Rehabilitation Committee fully reinstated his military rank and overturned his conviction posthumously.

The prison is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service History In August 2006, a report from Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons stated that both Moorland and HMP & YOI Hatfield Prisons were well managed, and provided a safe and respectful environment for inmates and staff. However the report also claimed that more than a third of prisoners were unoccupied at HMP & YOI Hatfield, with a lengthy waiting list of inmates wanting to join education classes. Weeks later, it was revealed that in a three-year period 190 inmates had escaped from HMP & YOI Hatfield. The Prison Service did not have statistics on how many of these inmates had been recaptured, but claimed that \\"most would have been returned to a closed prison at some point.\\" In 2010 HMP & YOI Moorland Open changed its name to become HMP & YOI Hatfield; which is still managed jointly with HMP & YOI Moorland. On 13 July 2011, it was announced that HMP & YOI Hatfield would be put out to tender, accepting bids from private companies and HM Prison Service for the management of the establishment. The prison today HMP & YOI Hatfield is a prison holding Category D adult males and young offenders. Prisoners are usually transferred from other prisons (especially Moorland Closed) to complete their sentences at HMP & YOI Hatfield.

It was written by series creators/executive producers Todd A. Kessler, Glenn Kessler, and Daniel Zelman, and was directed by producer Allen Coulter. In the episode, recent law school graduate Ellen Parsons (Rose Byrne) is recruited to Hewes and Associates, a law firm headed by Patty Hewes (Glenn Close), where she is assigned to the \\"Frobisher case\\". Billionaire Arthur Frobisher (Ted Danson) is being sued by his former employees, whom he advised to invest in his company while unloading his own stock, and while Frobisher's attorney Ray Fiske (≈Ωeljko Ivanek) pleads for a settlement price, Patty insists on taking the case to court. When the Kesslers and Zelman devised the series, they did not specifically intend for Patty and Ellen to be lawyers, wanting primarily to explore the power structures between two strong women‚ÄîPatty and her prot√©g√©e Ellen‚Äîand choosing a profession afterwards. Close agreed to play Patty so long as the series was filmed in New York City, where she resides. To prepare for their roles, Close, Byrne and Tate Donovan met with corporate lawyers, while Danson met with the CEOs of Fortune 500 companies. The pilot was filmed in February and FX placed a 13-episode order for the series in March. Its American airing brought in 3.7 million viewers and it was reviewed positively by most critics. It received two Emmy Award nominations for writing and directing and one win for Close for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. It was also nominated for an American Cinema Editors Award. Plot A young woman steps out of an elevator, bloody and half-naked. She leaves the building and runs down a busy street. She is taken to a police station, where two detectives, Dan Williams (Casey Siemaszko) and Rosario Ortiz (Maya Days), find in her pocket a business card for Hollis M. Nye. In an extended flashback to six months earlier, the woman is revealed to be Ellen Parsons, a recent law school graduate. She turns down a generous salary from Nye's firm to meet with Patty Hewes, head of Hewes and Associates. Later at a bar, Ellen meets Nye (Philip Bosco), who cautions that Patty is dangerous and has her sign a card reading \\"I was warned.\\" Ellen finds out that her interview with Patty is on the day of her sister's wedding. She declines the interview but Patty, intrigued to have been turned down, finds Ellen at the wedding and hires her. Patty is the lead attorney in a high-profile litigation, representing the bankrupted workers of a large company run by Frobisher, who allegedly advised his employees to invest in the company while selling his own stock. Patty insists on taking the case to trial rather than accepting a settlement, but on Ellen's first day it is revealed that the prosecution cannot yet link Frobisher to his stockbroker‚Äîthough both were in Palm Beach, Florida over the same weekend‚Äîand thus cannot disprove that the selling of his stock was not pre-arranged. When Ellen returns home, her boyfriend David Connor (Noah Bean) proposes to her and she accepts. Frobisher's attorney Ray Fiske visits David's sister Katie (Anastasia Griffith), who is opening a restaurant in which Frobisher is investing, and asks her to sign a confidentiality agreement. Frobisher meets with his former custodian Larry Popler (Victor Arnold), who names a settlement price of $100 million, which Ray returns to Patty. Patty persuades her clients to decline the offer, but Larry mentions a previous agreement to accept any offer of $100 million. Patty suspects that her advisor Tom (Tate Donovan) had known about the agreement and fires him. Katie, meanwhile, thinks that she is being watched, and tells Ellen and David that she had catered a function for Frobisher in Florida and that afterwards he had offered to help her open a restaurant. Ellen realizes that Patty hired her to get to Katie, a potential witness. Though Katie is initially hesitant to testify, she finds her dog Saffron dead in her apartment with a note reading \\"Quiet\\" pinned to a wall. Assuming that Frobisher is responsible, she agrees to meet with Patty to help bring Frobisher down. Tom meets with Patty, who had only pretended to fire him, and gives her Saffron's collar, which she throws into the ocean. Returning to the present, the two detectives seek Nye out and he identifies Ellen. They visit Ellen and David's apartment and find David dead in the bathtub. Ortiz tells Ellen to explain what had happened, and Ellen's only response is \\"Get me a lawyer.\\" Production Brothers Glenn and Todd Kessler decided to work with Daniel Zelman because \\"we have a third brother, but Daniel is kind of like our fourth brother that we've known for over 20 years.\\" When the Kesslers and Zelman devised the series, they did not specifically intend for Patty and Ellen to be lawyers. They wanted to explore the power structures in two strong women‚Äîfeeling that the male power dynamics had been seen before‚Äîand considered a number of professions, including entertainment and pharmaceuticals, before deciding on law. Zelman said that the writers' main motivation to write about the law \\"was our interest in power dynamics, the dynamics of power in society. We're very much interested in the ambiguity of it. We're just interested in seeing how far we can push these characters.\\" According to Kessler, \\"One thing that's crucial is that Patty Hewes is on one end of the spectrum and Ellen Parsons is on the other.\\" The relationship the writers were most interested in showing was that between a mentor and a mentee, which is represented by Patty and her prot√©g√©e Ellen. Todd Kessler called the real life Enron case \\"a big part\\" of the inspiration for Patty's main case involving Arthur Frobisher, though Zelman claims that Enron was not used as a basis in particular: \\"It was more just the culture of all those corporate scandals at the time. There seemed to be one after the other of them, and we became very interested in sort of the characters who were a part of those scandals.\\" Ted Danson met with powerful CEOs to prepare for his role. After co-starring on 2004's fourth season of The Shield on cable network FX, Close told network president John Landgraf that she would be open to star in another series, suggesting a spin-off for her Shield character, Captain Monica Rawling. Landgraf pitched Damages to Close, who agreed to play Patty so long as the series was shot in New York City, where she resides. To prepare for her role, Close met New York attorney Mary Jo White and her partner Lorna Scoffield, as well as litigator Patricia Hines, from whom Close learned \\"some extraordinary things\\". The producers sought after Byrne to play Ellen, but she was unavailable during the first round of auditions as she was filming 28 Weeks Later. She says the opportunity \\"came up again, so I went in, auditioned, and got the role\\". Like Close, Byrne spent time with a female lawyer in New York and read books written by litigators Alan Dershowitz and David DuBois, while Donovan talked to his uncle, a New York corporate lawyer. He visited Manhattan's Centre Street courts, where he \\"followed the most intense murder trial\\". Ivanek was so eager to work on the series that he auditioned for two different roles, and was cast as Ray. Todd Kessler said that Danson's 1979 film The Onion Field was \\"a huge influence on Glenn, Daniel and myself, and that was something that had always stuck in our minds. And when we sought out to cast this role of Arthur Frobisher, Ted kind of came into focus.\\" In preparation for his role, the producers asked Danson to meet with CEOs of Fortune 500 corporations and watch documentaries such as Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room, which examines the collapse of Enron. They also suggested that Danson meet with Close's acting coach Harold Guskin. The producers said that David and Katie were the hardest characters to cast. Noah Bean, who felt that he gave \\"an awful first audition\\" for the role of David, was called in for a second reading as he was waiting for an elevator to leave the building, and was ultimately cast. British actress Anastasia Griffith's agent informed her of the audition for the role of Katie only two hours before it began. When she met the producers, they were initially concerned about a Brit playing an American, especially since Australian Byrne had already signed on. \\"To put their fears at rest\\", Griffith addressed the producers in an American accent from beginning to end of the audition. After being cast, Griffith and Byrne visited New York University dialect coach Deborah Hecht to perfect their accents. The episode was shot in February and edited in March 2007. Filming took place on location at various sites around Manhattan; after the first season had been greenlit, sets were built at New York's Steiner Studios. Byrne said that filming the opening scene on a winter's morning in only underwear and a coat was \\"very traumatic\\" and \\"very hard\\". The series remained untitled during casting and filming, and was named Damages after FX had greenlit the pilot and placed a 13-episode order for the first season in March. Reception As the most-watched basic cable show of the night, \\"Get Me a Lawyer\\" drew 3.7 million viewers on its initial commercial-free airing, with a total of 5.1 million including the viewers of repeat airings later in the night. 1.2 million people fell into the target demographic of adults aged 18‚Äì49, while 1.5 million fell into the 25‚Äì54 age bracket. FX president John Landgraf deemed the pilot's ratings \\"middling\\" by the network's standards. The Australian premiere on the Nine Network brought in 999,000 viewers, making Damages the thirteenth most-watched show of the night. In Britain, BBC One's airing of the episode was seen by 1.9 million people with a share of 11%. Most critics reviewed \\"Get Me a Lawyer\\" positively. The New York Times Alessandra Stanley praised FX for choosing another series that \\"keep[s] the light focused on the dark side of its main characters\\". Stanley wrote that \\"Damages is yet another show that requires viewers to tune in to every episode to follow the plot, but it is the most grown-up thriller in the pack [of serialized drama series].\\" Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that, in the episode, \\"All the drama is in the writing and the acting.\\" He complimented the \\"strong cast\\", stating that \\"it's Close who makes Damages a series to contend with\\". Writing for The Age, Robin Oliver called the pilot \\"terrific-going-on- sensational\\". She praised Close and Byrne's performances, but also highlighted Danson's role as \\"a particularly fine piece of casting\\". Oliver's Age colleague Melinda Houston called Close \\"delicious ‚Äì and convincing\\" as Patty and thought that the script was \\"fabulous\\". S. P. Miskowski of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer remarked, \\"For my money, this is what a 'thriller' is all about.\\" TV Squad's Jonathan Toomey enjoyed the episode's flashbacks, saying that the style of the show \\"works and it works well\\". Matt Mitovich claimed in a TV Guide recap of the episode, \\"What a pilot it was!\\" He praised the acting from Close, Danson and Byrne, while he felt that \\"the supporting cast is excellent as well\\". Stuart Levine, writing for Variety, called the pilot his favorite episode of the first season. Other critics, however, did not respond well to the episode. Andrew Billen of The Times thought that the episode was \\"not as stylish, intelligent or classy as it hopes\\" and \\"about as subtle as Times Square\\". He called Close's performance \\"not remotely credible but impressive in a Norma Desmond way\\" and labeled Byrne as \\"particularly unstriking\\". Brian Lowry gave the pilot a lukewarm review for Variety. He praised the \\"solid cast\\" and \\"smart dialogue\\", but felt that \\"the template feels a little too familiar ... moreover, it's fuzzy how long the show's mystery will persist\\". Entertainment Weeklys Gillian Flynn graded the episode as a C‚àí, criticizing the characters' lack of logic and the \\"many ludicrous scenes\\". She thought the storylines to be overcomplicated and called Byrne \\"bland\\" and \\"inexpressive\\". \\"Get Me a Lawyer\\" received two Primetime Emmy Award nominations: Allen Coulter was nominated for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series, and Glenn Kessler, Todd A. Kessler, and Daniel Zelman were nominated for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series. The pilot episode was submitted to the Primetime Emmys judging panel for determining the nominees for Outstanding Drama Series; Damages was nominated but did not win the award. Close chose the episode as her Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series submission; she was nominated and went on to win the award. Editor Malcolm Jamieson was nominated for an American Cinema Editors Award for his work on this episode in the \\"Best Edited One-Hour TV Series (Commercial Television)\\" category.

Lusi was situated in the upper valley of the Aroanius, at about elevation in the Aroanian mountains, near present Kalavryta.√ñsterreichisches Arch√§ologisches Institut The upper valley of the Aroanius consists of two plains, of which the more easterly is the one through which the Aroanius flows, the waters of which force their way through a gorge in the mountains into the plain of Cleitor to the south. The more westerly plain is entirely shut in by a range of hills; and the waters of three streams which flow into this plain are carried off by a katavothra (underground channel), after forming an inundation, apparently the Lacus Clitorius mentioned by Pliny the Elder. The air was damp and cold; and in this locality the best hemlock was grown.Theophr. 9.15.8. Lusi was still independent in the 58th Olympiad (); since one of its citizens (Agesilas) is recorded to have gained the victory in the horse race in the 11th Pythiad. Its territory was ravaged by the Aetolians in the Social War. In the time of Pausanias (2nd century), there were no longer even any ruins of the town. Its name, however, was preserved in consequence of its temple of Artemis Lusia or Hemerasia (the \\"Soother\\"). The goddess was so called, because it was here that the daughters of Proetus were purified from their madness. They had concealed themselves in a large cavern, from which they were taken by Melampus, who cured them by sacred expiations. Thereupon their father Proetus founded this temple of Artemis Hemerasia, which was regarded with great reverence throughout the whole Peloponnesus as an inviolable asylum. It was plundered by the Aetolians in the Social War. It was situated near Lusi, at the distance of 40 stadia from Cynaetha.Callimachus, Dian. 233.

Profile The Allgemeine Zeitung is a Namibian newspaper. It is written by 10 editors; most of the staff members are either born or naturalized Namibians. It is read mostly by German-speaking Namibians (~15,000). The newspaper leans liberal-conservative. The circulation of the AZ stood at about 5,000 copies (Mondays to Thursdays, 12 to 16 pages) to about 6,000 copies (Fridays, up to 32 pages) in the 2000s and 2010s. A few hundred papers are sent to South Africa and some (mostly the Friday release) to Namibian expatriates and to Germany. Once a month (usually on the first Tuesday of the month), an extra for tourists is added. The circulation then increased to about 12,000 copies. In line with the general decrease of newspaper readership in the 2010s, there are about 4,000 copies printed each day. In 1991 Democratic Media Holdings (DMH) bought the Newspaper. The managing editor since 2004 is Stefan Fischer.Der M√§rkische Bote: ‚ÄûWei√üe Geschichten in Druckschwarz‚Äú, last view at 1. October 2012. He modernized the design, which increased demand and led to initial profit for the Allgemeine Zeitung. DMH also prints and releases Die Republikein, which is written in Afrikaans, and the Namibian Sun. All editorial content in the newspaper is written in German, a common minority language in Namibia which had attempts to revitalize as the official language. History The Allgemeine Zeitung was founded on 22 July 1916 under the name Der Kriegsbote (literally 'The War Envoy') and reported on the events of the First World War. After Germany was defeated and lost German South West Africa (now Namibia) to South Africa, the name was changed to Allgemeine Zeitung on 1 July 1919. In 1937, the newspaper was bought by the publisher John Meinert Ltd. The newspaper was released daily, except for Sundays, with a circulation of 1,800 copies. Most of the readers were Germans from Windhoek and surroundings. At that time the tagline was changed to indicate the intent to \\"support German national interests\\". For a short while starting in 1939, the newspaper was released under the name Deutscher Beobachter ('German Observer'). At the same time, smaller newspapers were released, such as Der Farmer ('The Farmer'), Das Volksblatt ('The People's Paper') owned by the Workers Association of South Africa, the Karakulz√ºchter ('The Karakul Stockman'), founded in 1933, and the Heimat ('Home'), a German paper for Africa's evangelical community. In 1958, Kurt Dahlmann, Germany's highest-decorated Jabo pilot of World War II, was hired as editor-in-chief. Writing under the pen name Stachus, symbolised as a potted cactus with an oblique dip pen, Dahlmann was adamant about the fleeting nature of apartheid. He wrote many editorials on this topic, suggesting ways that Namibia and South Africa should address the issue of inevitable black rule in both countries. In 1978, when the AZ and the Windhoek Advertiser were the only independent newspapers in South West Africa, Diether Lauenstein purchased both papers.Carsten von Nahmen: Deutschsprachige Medien in Namibia - Vom Windhoeker Anzeiger zum deutschen H√∂rfunkprogramm der Namibian Broadcasting Corporation: Geschichte, Bedeutung und Funktion der deutschsprachigen Medien in Namibia 1898 - 1998. Windhoek: Namibia Wissenschaftliche Gesellschaft, 2001. Dahlmann alleged that the money came from the regime in Pretoria; Klaus Dierks states that the German right-wing Hanns Seidel Foundation was the source of the financial backing. Dahlmann was fired and Lauenstein took over the editorship himself with the aim of bringing the paper \\"on a more conservative, pro-South African, pro-Apartheid and anti- Independence course\\". In 1981 Hans Feddersen became editor-in-chief. Literature * Karl B√∂mer: Handbuch der Weltpresse: Eine Darstellung des Zeitungswesens aller L√§nder.

It is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.  Taxonomy  The Egyptian weasel is so similar to the least weasel (M. nivalis) that only in 1992, it was suggested to be a separate species. However, results of a phylogenetic study indicate that mitochondrial DNA supports the Egyptian weasel to be a subspecies of Mustela nivalis rather than a distinct species. Characteristics Skull of an Egyptian weasel The Egyptian weasel has short legs, a small head, and small ears. Its tail is long and thin. The weasel has a broad snout. The upper part of the body is brown and the lower part is cream-colored. Sizes for the Egyptian weasel are: -Male head-body length: 36.1‚Äì43 cm -Female head-body length: 32.6‚Äì39 cm -Male tail length: 10.9-12.9 cm -Female tail length: 9.4‚Äì11 cm -Male weight: 60-130g -Female weight: 45-60g. Distribution and habitat The Egyptian weasel occurs in northern Egypt from Alexandria eastward to Port Said and southward through the delta and as far south as Beni Suef, located south of Cairo. It lives in the same places as humans, including cities and villages and has been described as an obligate synanthrope. Behaviour and ecology The Egyptian weasel is omnivorous and includes a significant amount (~50%) of vegetables and fruit in its diet, as well as waste human food and animals including rodents, chicks of poultry, rabbits, fish and insects. Their varied and opportunistic diet reflects their opportunistic synanthropic lifestyle. The males of the Egyptian weasel male are solitary and highly territorial, marking the territorial boundaries with urine and faeces. The female may establish a territory within a male's territory within which she will make a nest in a cavity, wall crevice or rock pile. She defends this territory from other females. = Reproduction = During courtship the pair trill and chatter and copulation can be quite a loud affair. After copulating she may remain with the male or the pair may separate and seek other mates. The females gives birth in her nest to a litter of between four and nine young, up to three times a year, if food supply allows. Threats At present, it is not considered threatened. Future potential threats are chemicals such as rodenticides, predation by domestic dogs and diseases.

In Vermont, the road runs south-north from the Massachusetts state line near Guilford to the international border. The that lie in Vermont are maintained by the Vermont Agency of Transportation (VTrans) and run largely parallel to Interstate 91. US 5 also follows the path of the Connecticut River from the Massachusetts border to St. Johnsbury, where the river turns northeast while US 5 continues north. The highway serves the major towns of Brattleboro, Hartford, and St. Johnsbury, along with the city of Newport near the Canadian border. Before the development of the Numbered Highway System, US 5 was designated Route 2 and was part of the New England road marking system that existed from 1922 to 1927. When the Highway System was formed in November 1926, the former Route 2 was commissioned as US 5\\\\. At this point, the road was not paved. It was not paved until the state of Vermont started overseeing the maintenance of the highway in 1931. The road was completely paved by 1933. Route description US 5 winds through the far eastern part of Vermont, passing through many small towns and villages. The road runs through a fairly rural, wooded area throughout much of its path in Vermont. =Southern Vermont= US 5 enters the southern end of Vermont in Windham County at the Massachusetts-Vermont state line just north of Bernardston and just south of Guilford, Vermont. The route is known as the Calvin Coolidge Memorial Highway from the Massachusetts border to the junction of Vermont Route 103 in Rockingham. The road winds through wooded land along the west side of Interstate 91 for its first 8 miles in Vermont. In Brattleboro, Vermont's fourth largest town, US 5 crosses under the interstate and winds through Brattleboro's business district. US 5 also starts a brief concurrency with Vermont Route 9 that continues for 2.3 miles. North of Brattleboro, after VT 9 turns east, US 5 crosses back over the interstate to the west side. US 5 continues north from Brattleboro, passing near the small towns of Dummerston and Putney. North of Putney, it crosses over I-91 to serve the towns of Westminster, Bellows Falls, and Rockingham. Near Rockingham, US 5 intersects Vermont Route 103, which picks up the Calvin Coolidge Memorial Highway. US 5 continues north on the east side of the interstate, crossing into Windsor County, for 6.6 miles to Springfield, where it crosses to the west side for just under a mile. Here, it picks up a 0.8 mile concurrency with Vermont Route 11 and US 5 crosses back to the east side of Interstate 91 with Route 11. Sign at junction of US 4, US 5, and VT 14 in White River Junction Route 5 continues along the east side of Interstate 91 for 20 miles after its concurrency with Route 11. Along this stretch, US 5 passes through Wilgus State Park in Ascutney and the town of Windsor. In Ascutney, US 5 picks up Vermont Route 12 for a 10-mile long concurrency. Route 12 winds along with US 5 through Windsor and across the interstate to Hartland, where it turns northwest away from US 5\\\\. North of Hartland, US 5 crosses Interstate 89 in White River Junction and intersects I-91 again. Now on the east side of I-91, US 5 winds around the northwest edge of White River Junction, where it hooks up with U.S. Route 4. Routes 4 and 5 run concurrent for half a mile, crossing the White River. US 5 continues north to the town of Wilder, where it forms the main road of the town. North of Wilder, US 5 crosses Interstate 91 twice. Just north of Norwich, US 5 crosses into Orange County and the town of Thetford. US 5 continues north, following the Connecticut River closely for 23 miles until it reaches the town of Bradford, passing through the small towns of North Thetford and Ely. =Northern Vermont= For around 11 miles north of Bradford, US 5 passes through rural country along the Connecticut River before reaching the village of Wells River. Here, US 5 has a very brief concurrency with U.S. Route 302. Continuing north, US 5 crosses into Caledonia County, then travels 11 miles before crossing to the west side of Interstate 91, passing through East Ryegate and Barnet. US 5 crosses back and forth across the interstate a couple of times north of Barnet before US 5 and I-91 split at the Passumpsic River, about 2 miles north of Barnet. US 5 winds along the west bank of the Passumpsic, traveling through the town of Passumpsic. US 5 and I-91 meet up again 2 miles north of Passumpsic in the town of St. Johnsbury. It is here in St. Johnsbury that the Connecticut River turns east away from US 5\\\\. US 5 during its concurrency with VT 105 in Newport US 5 continues north along the Passumpsic River from St. Johnsbury for about 7.5 miles until it reaches the city of Lyndon. In Lyndon, US 5 splits to the east away from Interstate 91. US 5 passes through West Burke, the Willoughby State Forest, and Barton before reaching the town of Orleans, 25 miles north of Lyndon. Along this stretch, US 5 reaches Orleans County. In the town of Orleans, US 5 crosses to the west side of the interstate, concurrent with Vermont Route 58 for half a mile. Route 5 continues north for 10 miles before reaching Newport. Along this 10 mile stretch, the road passes through Coventry. In Newport, US 5 picks up a 5-mile long concurrency with Vermont Route 105 that takes Route 5 across I-91 and into the village of Derby Center. US 5 continues north, crossing I-91 for the last time 2.5 miles north of Derby Center. 6.5 miles north of Derby Center, in the village of Derby Line, US 5 reaches its northern terminus at the international border, across the border from Stanstead, Quebec. US 5 continues past the Derby Line‚ÄìStanstead Border Crossing into Quebec as Quebec Route 143. History 100x100px In 1922, before the United States Numbered Highway System's creation, US 5 traversed through Vermont as New England Route 2, the Connecticut River Way. 5 years later in 1927, at the creation of the highway system, Route 2 was almost completely overtaken by the new U.S. Route 5. At its original designation, US 5 mostly followed Route 2's path, except for a temporary routing into New Hampshire. From 1927 to 1929, US 5 crossed the Connecticut River at Bellows Falls, VT into North Walpole, NH and wound along the river to Charlestown, NH where it crossed back into Vermont. US 5 was not maintained by the state of Vermont until the creation of the state highway system in 1931. At this point, US 5 was not paved. The state of Vermont started paving the route in 1931 and it was completed by 1933.

NIU School of Art Vocabulary URL accessed December 15, 2008 Likewise, a form can refer to a three-dimensional composition or object within a three-dimensional composition. Specifically, it is an enclosed space, the boundaries of which are defined by other elements of art. Shapes are limited to two dimensions: length and width.  Form  A form is an artist's way of using elements of art, principles of design, and media. Form as an element of art is three-dimensional and encloses space. Like a shape, a form has length and width, but it also has depth. Forms are either geometric or free-form. CategoriesGeometric and organic= Geometric shapes are precise edged and mathematically consistent curves, they are pure forms and so consist of circles, squares, spirals, triangles, while geometric forms are simple volumes, such as cubes, cylinders and pyramids. They generally dominate architecture, technology, industry and crystalline structures. In contrast, organic shapes are free-form, unpredictable and flowing in appearance. These shapes, as well as organic forms, visually suggest the natural world of animals, plants, sky, sea, etc... The addition of organic shapes to a composition dominated by geometric structures can add unpredictable energy.Bell-shaped flowers =Positive and negative= A positive shape is a shape, that has details inside it, such as an outline of a human, with body features. Contrarily, a negative shape is a shape without any details; it's just an outline. =Representation= A shape that is representative is created by the flattening out of three-dimensional objects. Nothing is actually geometric, but can be interpreted as such by breaking it down to shapes that, when put together, form a recognizable silhouette.

Program development The program was developed in the late 1970s by Don C. McGilvery at La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia as part of his Ph.D. research working with James Morrison, and was later adapted for personal computers in 1985 by David A. Dahl at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. With Richard Morrison at Monash University, McGilvery developed a Macintosh version of SIMION, known as MacSIMION. In recognition of the importance of their work, McGilvery and Dahl shared the Distinguished Contribution Award from the American Society for Mass Spectrometry in 1998. SIMION 8.0 was initially released in 2006. The current version is SIMION 8.1, released in August 2011; minor updates are being released continuously. Calculations SIMION 3D is a widely used ion-optics simulation program in many branches of physics. In SIMION, electrostatic fields can be modelled as boundary value problem solutions of an elliptical partial differential equation called the Laplace equation. The specific method used within SIMION to solve this equation is a finite difference method called over-relaxation. This technique is applied to a three-dimensional potential array (PA) of points representing electrode and non-electrode regions. The objective is to obtain a best estimate of the voltages for the points between the electrodes. The three-dimensional array is chosen to have either cylindrical or planar symmetry or no symmetry at all. The Laplace equation has the convenient property that its solution is a sum over the contribution from each electrode. Therefore, after the electric field array has been found once by iteration, the voltages of the individual electrodes can be changed and the new fields are immediately obtained. When the electric fields have been obtained, the trajectories of charged particles in these fields can be calculated. Particle trajectory calculations are a result of three interdependent computations. First, electrostatic forces must be calculated at the current position of the ion. These forces are then used to compute the current ion acceleration and then by numerical integration techniques to predict the position and velocity of the ion at the next time step. Moreover, the time step itself is continuously adjusted to maximize trajectory accuracy. A standard fourth-order Runge‚ÄìKutta method is used for numerical integration of the ion trajectory in three dimensions.

Under the act, the majority of native New Zealand vertebrate species are protected by law, and may not be hunted, killed, eaten or possessed. Violations may be punished with fines of up to $100,000. Wildlife are classified under a number of schedules; all vertebrate species not included in these lists are protected by default. The schedules are occasionally amended; for example the kea was granted full protection in 1984, whereas the spur-winged plover (masked lapwing), an Australian species which naturally established itself in New Zealand in the 1930s, had its protected status removed in 2012. The Act also provides for wildlife sanctuaries, refuges and management reserves. SchedulesSchedule 1 - Wildlife declared to be game= This group comprises commonly hunted waterfowl (mallard, grey duck, Australasian shoveler, paradise shelduck, black swan and p≈´keko) and introduced game birds, including pheasant, quail, chukar and partridge. These birds may be hunted during the open season, which begins in early May and lasts approximately four weeks. =Schedule 2 - Partially protected wildlife= This group comprises just the little owl, the silvereye and, on the Chatham Islands only, the brown skua (Catharacta antarctica lonnbergi). These birds may be shot by landowners if they pose a threat to crops or livestock, without any need for a permit from the Department of Conversation. This group formerly included the kea, which has been blamed for attacking sheep, but is now considered endangered. =Schedule 3 - Wildlife that may be hunted or killed subject to Minister's notification= These may be culled on application to the Department of Conservation, subject to whatever restrictions are imposed. This group includes the Australasian harrier, grey teal, grey-faced petrel, mute swan, black shag, little shag, pied shag and sooty shearwater. =Schedule 4 - Wildlife not protected, except in areas and during periods specified in Minister's notification= This group formerly consisted of feral horses, which had some degree of protection in the Kaimanawa range, but is now obsolete. =Schedule 5 - Wildlife not protected= This is a large group that includes many common domestic and introduced species, many of which are regarded as pests. It includes numerous land mammals and birds, three species of Australian Litoria tree frogs, the Australian rainbow skink (Lampropholis delicata) and the North American red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta elegans). The only species on this list that occur naturally in New Zealand are the southern black-backed gull and the spur-winged plover (masked lapwing), both of which present a significant risk of bird strike. =Schedule 6 - Animals declared to be noxious animals subject to the Noxious Animals Act 1956= This group consists of the chamois, the Himalayan tahr, and all species of deer (the family Cervidae), goats (the genus Capra), and pigs (the genus Sus). All are considered harmful to New Zealand's native forests and may be hunted without restriction. =Schedule 7 - Terrestrial and freshwater invertebrates declared to be animals= Under the original legislation, the word \\"animal\\" referred only to land-based vertebrates. Schedule 7 was added to give protected status to a number of native invertebrates, most of them endangered. The species include two native grasshoppers, many species of beetle, including the Cromwell chafer and the coxella weevil, all giant wƒìtƒÅ, the katip≈ç spider, the Nelson cave spider, and several kinds of native snails including all Powelliphanta and Placostylus. =Schedule 7A - Marine species declared to be animals= Similarly, this list gives protected status to a number of marine species, including some corals (notably black coral), several sharks, and two species of grouper.

Published in the Fall of 1914, Drift and Mastery argues that rational scientific governing can overcome forces of societal drift. Lippmann argued that due to the profound social and economic change old ideas and institutions lacked relevance. Specifically, Drift and Mastery warns against a reliance on broad theories and the framework of competition and self-interest. Democracy and society at large, he argued, was unable to address problems because it was adrift, lacking intentionality and discipline. Lippmann's prescription in Drift and Mastery was deliberate and scientific governing, what he termed mastery. This forward-looking progressive vision sought a better society through rational, scientific order, while rejecting Marxist, Utopian and traditionalist thinking. Drift and Mastery received enormously positive reviews, establishing Lippmann as an important public intellectual and figure within the progressive movement. Although Lippmann later lost faith in the promise of science and rationality in government, Drift and Mastery was and is regarded as an important document of the progressive movement. SummaryPart One= The Themes of Muckraking Lippmann examines the trend of muckraking journalism as emblematic of the underlying social conditions in America. Lippmann argues the increasing scope of government and integration of society led to the proliferation of muckraking. According to Lippmann, corruption had always existed in politics, but social change and the expansion of government made it relevant and scandalous. He argues muckraking is therefore neither \\"progressive or reactionary\\",Drift and Mastery, 34 but simply a manifestation of the bewilderment of society at evolving social and economic arrangements. New Incentives Lippmann argues against commercial competition as the best incentive for industry. Opposing systematic anti-trust policies, he believes well-managed trusts can increase cooperation while minimizing waste. Lippmann advocates scientific experimentation to find the most efficient mode of business. Increased power for labor and the consumer he argues will lead to a new system of incentives. Lippmann also notes the development of school of business administration may encourage a scientific ethic to replace businesses' reliance on competition. The Magic of Property Lippmann asserts that old definitions of property are outmoded by the advances of industrial capitalism, especially stock ownership in corporations. As a solution he proposes government ownership of some industry (steel, oil, coal, etc.) combined with the application of managerial skill. Lippmann further challenges the view that private ownership and especially stock ownership leads to efficiency. Citing the construction of the Panama Canal, he argues government can work efficiently when given the means. Caveat Emptor Lippmann addresses the concerns of consumers as part of the new economic order. He argues that because of lack of information and the misinformation of advertising current patterns of consumption were inefficient. Lippmann sees several ways of correcting this problem. According to Lippmann, centralization and conglomeration of business will create greater accountability to consumers by focusing their attention. Politically, Lippmann argues that voting rights for women, the primary household consumer, will increase the importance of the consumer in the political realm. Lippmann speculates that consumers are, \\"destined to be stronger than the interests either of labor or of capital.\\"Drift and Mastery, 54 A Key to the Labor Movement Lippmann argues that labor unions form a necessary safeguard against tyrannical capitalism and bring democracy to industry. As Lippmann states, \\"Without unions industrial democracy is unthinkable. Without democracy in industry, that is where it counts most, there is no such thing as democracy in America.\\"Drift and Mastery, 59 Lippmann goes on to criticize radical unions such as the IWW, arguing they do not value tangible gains for their members. The Funds of Progress Lippmann addresses the question of how increased social programs can be paid for. He argues there is a social surplus that can be created by increasing efficiency using management and science. Lippmann argues that business when forced to account for the interest of the worker, the consumer and the government will refrain from \\"reducing wages or raising prices\\"Drift and Mastery, 75 and will instead focus on industrial efficiency. Science and management, he argues, will allow business to find the \\"funds of progress\\" by reducing waste, increasing cooperation and simply being industrially efficient. A Nation of \\"Villagers\\" Lippmann begins by examining the hostility to trusts. He argues that much hostility can be attributed not to trusts unethical actions, but to their relative newness. In this vein Lippmann criticizes politicians who appeal to a sense of outrage in trusts and new economic arrangements. He specifically mentions both William Jennings Bryan and Woodrow Wilson, who he believes falsely idealize the small-scale agrarian past. Lippmann states this view quite succinctly at the end of the chapter writing, > Those who cling to the village view of life may deflect the drift, may > batter the trusts around a bit, but they will never dominate business, never > humanize its machinery, and they will continue to be playthings of > industrial change. At the bottom the issue is between those who are willing > to enter upon effort for which there is no precedent, and those who > aren't.Drift and Mastery, 87 =Part Two= A Big World and Little Men In this chapter Lippmann contrasts the complexity of societal problems with simplistic institutions. He argues just as a city dweller is unaccustomed to dealing with the countryside, our institutions are unable to deal with the \\"big\\" modern world. Lippmann therefore asserts institutions should, and in democracies already have, adapt themselves to these changed conditions. More personally, Lippmann claims this \\"big world\\" causes individual turmoil as, \\"Those changes distract him so deeply that the more 'advanced' he is, the more he flounders in the bogs of his own soul.\\"Drift and Mastery, 100 Drift Lippmann begins by asserting that Wilson's New Freedom is flawed because it assumed an older form of democracy can be retrieved. This looking backwards for a golden age is fruitless and is essentially childish according to Lippmann. On similar grounds Lippmann goes on to criticize Marxian socialists who he sees as unrealistic in their assumptions. Lippmann ends by defining the challenge of \\"drift.\\" He calls drift a \\"spiritual problem,\\" which is caused by the combination of social/economic change and the freedom from the old order.Drift and Mastery, 111 The Rock of Ages In this chapter Lippmann criticizes the dogmatic clinging to tradition and further outlines the challenge of modern social and economic arrangements. Lippmann goes on to examine immigration and uses the metaphor of immigration to describe all people are immigrants in the rapidly changing modern world. =Part Three= A Note on the Women's Movement Lippmann cites the women's movement as a perfect example of how the \\"rock of ages\\" has given way to a modern dilemma where freedom must be exercised rationally. Women's rights he argues, are necessary simply because society has already moved past demarcated \\"spheres.\\" He emphasizes the movement towards women's rights and rationality in housework and child rearing will be especially dramatic because women have heretofore been irrational and conservative in their actions. Noticeably, Lippmann is not completely on board with a feminist agenda. He states plainly that female participation in the labor force is a societal ill that will hopefully come to an end. Bogeys Lippmann examines how, especially in an increasingly complex world, fear prevents society from addressing problems rationally. He argues that removing everyday concerns and fears will lead to greater rationality and boldness on the part of citizens. Invoking Freud, he argues that constructed fears unconsciously hold people and society back from achievement.Drift and Mastery, 137 Poverty, Chastity, Obedience Lippmann argues poverty, chastity and obedience are a more primitive and brutal means of controlling a society, compared with self-government. Notably, he argues that, \\"To create a minimum standard of life below which no human being can fall is the most elementary duty of the democratic state.Drift and Mastery, 141\\" Lippmann extends the implications of this argument asserting that those afflicted by poverty are \\"unfit for self-government.\\" Similarly, Lippmann advocates moving beyond valuing chastity. Instead he argues, \\"Our interest in sex is no longer to annihilate it, but to educate it, to find civilized opportunities for its expression.\\"Drift and Mastery, 143 Summing up this line of argument, Lippmann asserts old virtues sought to restrain citizens whereas true democratic virtues should provide people with a rich life where they deal with life in all its complexity. Mastery Lippmann begins this chapter by citing the example of a primitive tribe who had traditionally chopped down trees with the ineffective method of straight cuts. When the more effective \\"western\\" method of using V-shaped cuts was introduced, Lippmann relates, the tribe insisted on the less effective method for the sake of tradition. Lippmann argues current society clinging to traditional methods and economic approach to are as irrational as tribesmen refusing to make V-shaped cuts. Lippmann goes on to define the scientific and rational application of new methods and approaches as mastery. Notably, he argues science is inextricably linked to democracy, that \\"The scientific spirit is the discipline of democracy.\\"Drift and Mastery, 151 Modern Communion Lippmann begins examining the individual implications of his societal framework. He argues that science, unlike socialism, provides a means for collective cooperation for the betterment of society. Science, according to Lippmann, allows people worldwide to approach problems within the same framework and come to similar conclusions. Spelling out his pragmatic understanding Lippmann argues science, \\"distinguishes between fact and fancy, and works always with the implied resolution to make the best out of what is possible.\\"Drift and Mastery, 156 Fact and Fancy In his final chapter, Lippmann fully takes on the impact of science. He notes that science may seem ill-suited to social concerns and generally impersonal. Lippmann differentiates the scientific viewpoint from a complete rejection of tradition. He argues that past, because of its variety of ways of life and societies, can be a source of inspiration. Instead of an \\"abrupt break with the accumulated wisdom of the past,\\" Lippmann favors taking what is rational and useful from tradition.Drift and Mastery, 162 Lippmann concludes by affirming the power of science to encompass the full range of human experience and materially improve upon it. He argues that science is the means to make \\"reality bend to our purposes.\\"Drift and Mastery, 177 ThemesSocial Change= Lippmann grounds his argument in the supposition that the world had changed radically. Lippmann draws a steep distinction between the modern world, and the world in which traditions and institutions were created. He asserts the modern world is, \\"brain-splitting in its complexity,\\" to the point where no individual or institution can understand it. Therefore, he argues, institutions and ideas must evolve to keep pace with these changes. This sentiment is perhaps best encapsulated by the noted quotation from Chapter 10 The Rock of Ages, > We are all of us immigrants in the industrial world, and we have no > authority to lean upon. We are an uprooted people, newly arrived, and > nouveau riche. As a nation we have all the vulgarity that goes with that, > all the scattering of soul. The modern man is not yet settled in this world. > It is big. The evidence is everywhere: the amusements of the city; the jokes > that pass for jokes; the blare that stands for beauty, the folklore of > Broadway, the feeble and apologetic pulpits, the cruel standards of success, > raucous purity. We make love to ragtime and we die to it. We are blown > hither and thither like litter before the wind. Our days are lumps of > experience.Drift and Mastery, 112 Lippmann therefore sees attempts to restore first principles or traditional values as both quixotic and counterproductive. Lippmann saw a new world in the twentieth century that required new means of control and improvement. =Science and Management= Lippmann relies heavily on the ability of the scientific method to reform and improve society. Drift and Mastery continually proposes science as both a means of improving society and an alternative to dogma and outmoded means to governing. Lippmann associates science with democracy, writing \\"It is self-government.\\"Drift and Mastery, 150 Within the shared discipline of science Lippmann sees hope for a cosmopolitan society. Scientific innovations and ideas that hold a common language and legitimacy that appeal strongly to Lippmann. Lippmann's reform prescriptions often involve improving management and efficiency of bureaucratic institutions. Specifically, he believes introducing the scientific method and a professional ethic to business holds tremendous promise. Looking to the beginnings of schools of business administration, Lippmann asserts planning and rational management holds the key to the promise of democracy and modern society. =Criticism of Private Property and Profit Motives= Lippmann opposes the universality and ideas of the sanctity of private property. Economically, he argues repeatedly against schemes of competition and free markets. Competitive capitalism to Lippmann is inefficient and wasteful, an outdated system in the modern world. Although he opposes Marxism, he frequently voices support of increased economic cooperation and central control. For Lippmann, the trend towards conglomeration and trusts is a rational and scientific step towards greater efficiency. Where private excess in trusts failed, he asserts that management and government control of \\"large-scale\\" industries can yield huge gains for society. Reaction Upon its publishing, Drift and Mastery received enthusiastic reviews. The New York Times called it \\"a brilliant production, both in style and content.\\"The New York Times (1915). \\"Solving Problems of Modern Society\\". The New York Times. August 1: BR274. Leaders of the progressive movement hailed Drift and Mastery both for its content and literary style. Theodore Roosevelt, who had met and consulted with Lippmann during the writing, said that \\"No man who wishes seriously to study our present social, industrial and political life can afford not to read it through and through and ponder and digest it.\\"Steel, Ronald (1999). Walter Lippman and the American Century. Piscataway, NJ, Transaction Publishers, Page 77. Similarly effusive praise came from Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. who said that the book was \\"devilishly well-written . . . altogether a delightful fresh piece of writing and thinking.\\" Outside the community of progressives and reformers, reactions to Drift and Mastery were more mixed. The religious community criticized Lippmann's rejection of traditional values and dismissal of contemporary religion.Hollinger, David (1977). \\"Science and Anarchy: Walter Lippmann's Drift and Mastery\\". American Quarterly. 29, 463-475. These religious commentators specifically criticized both Lippmann's implicit break with religious teachings and his self-assured tone. A small minority of reviewers criticized Lippmann for his reliance on the power of science, accusing him of a dogmatic adherence to experts over \\"the people.\\"Anderson, Margaret Our First Year. (1915). The New York Times Book Review, Common to these criticisms was a sense that Lippmann was premature in pronouncing the death of old institutions and ideas. Although Lippmann had captured the feeling of dynamism in the reform movement of his time, many arguably severely underestimated the durability of the old order.

Suppose that the inventor seeks to patent computers containing the new microprocessor, where the microprocessor cooperates with the other elements of the computers in the same conventional way that microprocessors have previously cooperated with the other elements of computers. The computer with the new microprocessor would be an exhausted combination. This hypothetical case is based on the facts of the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision in Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc., 128 S. Ct. 2109 (2008). The doctrine is also termed the doctrine of the Lincoln Engineering case because the United States Supreme Court explained the doctrine in its decision in Lincoln Engineering Co. v. Stewart-Warner Corp.Justia and FindLaw, 303 U.S. 545 (1938)]. The Lincoln Engineering decision In Lincoln Engineering, the inventor invented a new and improved coupling device to attach a nozzle to a grease gun. The patent, however, claimed the whole combination of grease gun, nozzle, and coupling. The Supreme Court stated that \\"the improvement of one part of an old combination gives no right to claim that improvement in combination with other old parts which perform no new function in the combination\\".303 U.S. at 549-50. It then concluded that the inventor's \\"effort, by the use of a combination claim, to extend the monopoly of his invention of an improved form of chuck or coupler to old parts or elements having no new function when operated in connection with the coupler renders the claim void.\\"303 U.S. at 552. This way of claiming an invention was termed ‚Äúoverclaiming,‚Äù because it inflated the royalty base for licensing and potentially effectuated a tie-in by means of which the patentee required users, for example, to purchase not only the couplings but the whole grease gun as well in order to use the invention.See Landis on Mechanics of Patent Claim Drafting ¬ß 8:4. Is the Lincoln Engineering doctrine obsolete? The Federal Circuit held in 1984 that this doctrine is outdated and no longer reflects the law.See Radio Steel & Mfg. Co. v. MTD Products, Inc., 731 F.2d 840, 845 (Fed. Cir. 1984). The Federal Circuit‚Äôs predecessor court, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, had made similar suggestions. See, e.g., In re Bernhardt, 417 F.2d 1395 (Ct. Cus. & Pat. App. 1969). In effect, the Federal Circuit overruled the Supreme Court on this point‚Äîor claimed that the passage of the 1952 patent recodification law had done so. In its decision in Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.,128 S. Ct. 2109 (2008). however, the Supreme Court seems to have assumed without any discussion that its old precedents such as Lincoln Engineering (uncited in the Quanta opinion) are still in force, as least with regard to the exhaustion doctrine. In Quanta, the Court considered the sale of a patented microprocessor to \\"exhaust\\" not only the patent on the microprocessor but the patent on a conventional personal computer (PC) containing the microprocessor, since the PC patent had essentially the same inventive concept (or departure from the prior art) as the microprocessor patent. After 1984 it appeared that it was possible to obtain patents on old combinations, for example not only a new motor but also an otherwise conventional disc drive containing the new motor. It has also been held that the sale of the motor, in such a case, does not exhaust the patent on the disc drive containing the new motor. Hence, a purchaser of the motor who incorporated it into a disk drive would infringe the disk drive patent.See Minebea Co. v. Papst, 444 F. Supp. 2d 68 (D.D.C. 2006). It is now uncertain whether such patents are valid. In any event, the Quanta decision appears to hold that the exhaustion doctrine shields from infringement liability the foregoing motor purchaser that incorporates the motor into a disk drive.This result would be contrary to that reached in Minebea Co. v. Papst, 444 F. Supp. 2d 68 (D.D.C. 2006). Exhausted combinations and nonstatutory subject matter Claiming a computer-related advance as an exhausted combination may provide a way to prevent the claimed advance from being classified as nonstatutory subject matter under section 101 of the US patent law. Placing a process that fails the machine-or- transformation test in a machine environment may overcome the absence of implementation by a specific machine, as required by In re Bilski and the Supreme Court decisions on which it is based.This expedient was suggested initially in Richard H. Stern, Tales From the Algorithm War, 18 AIPLA Q.J. 371 (1991). (The successfulness of this expedient depends on acceptance of the Federal Circuit's abolition of the exhausted combination doctrine.See Radio Steel & Mfg. Co. v. MTD Products, Inc., 731 F.2d 840, 845 (Fed. Cir. 1984); In re Bernhardt, 417 F.2d 1395 (Ct. Cus. & Pat. App. 1969).) For example, the form of the processes claimed in Diamond v. Diehr,450 U.S. 175 (1981). Parker v. Flook,437 U.S. 584 (1978). and Gottschalk v. Benson409 U.S. 63 (1972). may appropriately be compared. In Diehr, the claim is to ‚Äúa method of operating a rubber-molding press‚Äù and the claim contains at least minimal references to the press and other apparatus. In Flook, the claim is to a \\"method for updating the value of at least one alarm limit,\\" where an ‚Äú‚Äôalarm limit‚Äô is a number.‚Äù The claim does not say anything about a reaction vessel or even temperature measuring devices. In Benson, the claim is to ‚Äúa data processing method for converting binary coded decimal number representations into binary number representations.‚Äù One claim mentions a reentrant shift register and the other claim mentions no apparatus at all. In Flook, the claim could have instead been to ‚Äúa method of operating a hydrocracking plant wherein hydrocarbon feedstock is placed into a chemical reactor, heat is applied, etc.‚Äù The claim, although to an exhausted combination,The Court‚Äôs opinion states that it was conceded that the process was known and conventional except for its use of the algorithm. would have required apparatus as did that in the Diehr case. Similarly, the claim in Benson could have been to a method of operating a telephone switch box or perhaps even a method of providing binary- coded-decimal numerical signals to a binary-coded operating device. Again, by providing a mechanical environment, even though it was an exhausted combination, the claims drafter might have avoided the holding of nonstatutory subject matter. It is possible that careful claims drafting techniques will succeed in elevating form over substance, to avoid the impact of the machine- or-transformation test. The preceding analysis may have been overtaken by the Supreme Court's 2014 decision in Alice v. CLS Bank. In that case the Court confirmed and extended the legal analysis of its prior decisions in Parker v. Flook and Mayo v. Prometheus to claimed inventions involving implementations of computer algorithms, methods of doing business, and other methods of organizing human activity. The form of analysis that these cases dictate is that the presence of a machine, in particular a programmed digital computer, is not enough without more to assure patent eligibility. Rather, the implementation of the underlying idea must embody an \\"inventive concept.\\" The inventive concept must provide \\"something extra\\" that extends beyond the algorithm or other idea, if an otherwise patent-ineligible claim is to be saved from patent ineligibility‚Äîaccording to these cases and recent lower court decisions that follow in their wake.See generally the cases discussed in the Wikipedia article Software patents under United States patent law, particularly the last several footnotes.

Accomplished in a wide variety of styles, including classical, world music, rock and free improvisation, she came to prominence as the touring cellist for Nirvana from 1993‚Äì1994 and appears on their live album MTV Unplugged in New York. She was a member of Earth, the Black Cat Orchestra, and Spectratone International, and also performs solo.Black Cat Orchestra website. Retrieved 15 December 2008  Career  Training and early bands (1970s‚Äì1991) = Raised in the Long Island town of East Meadow, Goldston received training on cello, guitar, piano, and voice. She studied cello with Aaron Shapinsky, and guitar with Bob Suppan and Joe Monk. At Bennington College, Goldston trained with Maxine Neuman, Milford Graves, Arthur Brooks, Vivian Fine, and Frank Baker. Goldston dropped out before attaining a degree and would later describe herself as ‚Äúrigorously detrained.‚Äù In 1986, Goldston moved to Seattle. Through the late eighties, Goldston performed with the Run/Remain Ensemble, a multimedia collaboration with Dayna Hanson, Kyle Hanson, Greg Lachow, and Megan Murphy. In 1989, Goldston co-founded the Black Cat Orchestra, with Don Crevie on horn, Scott Granlund on saxophone, Jessika Kenney on vocals, and Goldston's partner and fellow Run/Remain alum Kyle Hanson on accordion. = Nirvana's MTV Unplugged session and studio recordings (1994‚Äì2003) = In the mid-nineties, Goldston rose to prominence in the Pacific Northwest music scene as a session cellist, notably joining Nirvana on a US tour and appearing on their famous MTV Unplugged in New York set. Through the nineties and early millennium, Goldston played on dozens of studio albums. Meanwhile, with the Black Cat Orchestra, she toured and recorded for prominent national acts, including David Byrne (on his 1997 album Feelings), the One Reel Film Festival (at that time under the aegis of Bumbershoot), and NPR's This American Life. In 1996, the group recorded and independently released a self-titled debut album. They followed it in 2001 with Mysteries Explained, co-produced with Irene Records, and then and Long Shadows at Noon from Yoyo Recordings (2003). = Later bands and collaborations with Mirah (2003‚Äì2015) = In 2003, Goldston and Hanson entered the first of many collaborations with then-Portland-based artist Mirah. The Black Cat Orchestra teamed up with Mirah for the political album To All We Stretch the Open Arm. Goldston's group disbanded in 2004, but soon after, she and Hanson founded Spectratone International. Goldston and Hanson reprised their roles on cello and accordion, respectively. They were joined by Kane Mathis on oud, Jane Hall on percussion, and Darko Vukmanic on bass. With Spectratone International, Goldston's rejoined Mirah for the 2007 album Share This Place: Stories and Observations. For the project, Goldston commissioned stop-motion animator Britta Johnson to make short films for the band to perform against live; Share This Place premiered at the 2006 Seattle International Children's Festival and was performed throughout the US, including the Kennedy Center, Museum of Fine Arts, Portland Institute for Contemporary Art's TBA Festival, Henry Art Gallery, and What the Heck Fest. Goldston has also appeared as a solo artist on Mirah's recent albums (a)spera (2009) and Changing Light (2014). In 2005, Goldston formed another ensemble, Instead Of, with Angelina Baldoz (trumpet, flute, and bass), Jaison Scott (drums), and Torben Ulrich (text and vocals). The group independently released the album Live on Sonarchy in 2007. By 2009, Goldston was also regularly touring and recording with Earth. She appeared on their two-part Angels of Darkness, Demons of Light (2011, 2012), but by 2015, Goldston had left the band to pursue independent projects. = Solo work = As a solo artist, Goldston has recorded and performed around the country and the world. Her work is often eclectic, irreverent, and genre-bending. She has appeared as a voiceover artist on The Dina Martina Holiday Album (playing the role of Martina's eleven-year-old daughter Phoebe); and composed a suite of solo cello work in response to Melinda Mueller's poetry collection Mary‚Äôs Dust. She has also worked on numerous dramas, and as a co-creator (with Stacey Levine and Goldston's partner Kyle Hanson) of the puppet opera The Wreck of the St. Nikolai (2003) for On the Boards and the radio play The Post Office. Goldston has worked on performances with composers including Eyvind Kang, Jherek Bischoff, Cynthia Hopkins, Malcolm Goldstein, Matana Roberts, Terry Riley, Eddie Prevost, Steve Moore, Bob Marsh, Olivia Block, Byron Au Yong, Erin Jorgensen, Bill Horist, Threnody Ensemble, Scott Fields, Christian Asplund, and Julio Lopezhiler. She has ongoing and/or long-term collaborations with Jessika Kenney, Robert Jenkins (a.k.a. Buzz Gundersen), Paul Hoskin, Ellen Fullman, Angelina Baldoz, Ed Pias, Vanessa Renwick, Greg Campbell, Stuart Dempster, Dan Sasaki, and Clyde Petersen. With an emphasis on improvisational work, Goldston has composed on-the-spot in performances with Lonnie Holley, Vratislav Brabenec, Ilan Volkov, Amy Denio, Thollem McDonnas, Mazen Kerbaj, Marisa Anderson, Dan Peek, Bal√°sz P√°ndi, Kanako Pooknyw, Stuart Dempster, Dana Reason, Mary Oliver, and Jaap Blonk. From 2015 to 2017, Goldston traveled to Tel Aviv, Athens, and Glasgow for the Tectonics Festival, culminating in a composition for the BBC Scottish Symphony. Goldston has been commissioned by numerous established arts organizations, including performing arts companies like On the Boards, Portland Institute for Contemporary Art's Time-Based Art (TBA) Festival, the Degenerate Art Ensemble; and art institutions such as the Frye Art Museum, the Seattle Asian Art Museum, the New Foundation, and the Henry Art Gallery. Numerous theaters, film organizations, and dance companies have commissioned Goldston to compose scores including the Olympia Film Society, the Rebecca Stenn Dance Company, 33 Fainting Spells, Seattle Jewish Film Festival, and the Regenbogen Kino in Germany. Numerous of these commissions, including those for Bumbershoot's One Reel Film Festival, Northwest Film Forum, and Seattle International Film Festival, have included composing scores for early silent films. In 2001, Goldston collaborated with filmmaker Lynn Shelton on ‚ÄúOur Round Earth‚Äù for On the Boards's Northwest New Works Festival and in 2009 scored Shelton's feature film Humpday. She has collaborated extensively with choreographer Peter Kyle composing for dance pieces. She has also contributed to numerous film scores, including the 2016 stop-motion film Torrey Pines and the documentaries Water Is Life and Where the House Was. In 2013, Goldston released a solo album of such work, entitled Film Scores, through the Sub Rosa record label. In January 2017, Goldston was commissioned to compose and perform a solo acoustic cello score for √âtude's Paris Fashion Week runway show. The score was recorded at the Paris Red Bull studio and released as a limited edition LP by Ed Banger.  Musical style and influences  Goldston is known in large part for her improvisational work. Her work in cello is notable for a disorienting emphasis on pizzicato, which Goldston has said stemmed from attempts to play her cello like a guitar. Goldston has been heavily influenced by Western classical music and folk tunes, citing the Folkways folk and ethnographic records as childhood touchstones and Arnold Schoenberg, Toru Takemitsu, John Cage, George Crumb, Olivier Messiaen, and Carl Maria von Weber as influences later in her life. Though not a jazz musician, Goldston has studied and listened to jazz extensively, particularly Eric Dolphy, Wes Montgomery, John Coltrane, Charles Mingus, Thelonious Monk, Albert Ayler, and Pharoah Sanders. At the award ceremony for her 2012 Genius Award for Music, Goldston handed the orchestra written directions on how to follow her rather than sheet music, a move she traced back to Ornette Colman. The Stranger said that \\"listening to her was not entirely an earthbound experience [...] the music could only be described as a storm or flock of sound.\\" Goldston draws on musical styles from around the world. She has performed as a member of the Seattle Turkish Music Ensemble and Seattle Chinese Orchestra, Volunteer Park Conservatory Orchestra, with Turkish Sufi singer Latif Bolat, Brazilian music with guitarist Marco De Carvalho, Japanese 20th-century and classical repertoire with Elizabeth Falconer, Klezmer music with Jack Falk, Lev Lieberman, Sandra Layman, Hank Bradley and Cathy Whitesides.

In 1900, the Gratwick family of Buffalo helped to finance Park's laboratory with a $25,000 donation in memory of William Henry Gratwick, a patient of Park's. Park was also a professor of surgery at the University at Buffalo Medical School and a surgeon at Buffalo General Hospital.Mirand, Dr. Edwin A., Legacy and History of Roswell Park Cancer Institute 1898‚Äì1998. Virginia Beach, VA: The Donning Company Publishers p. 15 When Park was thirty-one, he went to Buffalo, New York in 1883. He came from Chicago where he received his Doctor of Medicine degree from Northwestern University in 1876. He received his B.A. in 1872 and M.A. in 1875 from Racine College in Racine, Wisconsin. He then went on to finish his Doctor of Medicine studies at the Northwestern University School of Medicine in 1876. Park received an honorary M.A. from Harvard University in 1895 and an honorary LL.D. from Yale University. Over the years he served on many boards, both national and international. By 1914, the total number of textbooks, articles, and monographs that he wrote reached 167. President McKinley assassination Buffalo was the host of the Pan-American Exposition in 1901. That year, President William McKinley was not even a year into his second term. He was staying in his summer home in Canton, Ohio when he left his summer home for the exposition fairgrounds. McKinley gave a speech at the Temple of Music on the Exposition grounds when Leon Czolgosz came from the crowd and shot McKinley twice at point-blank range. McKinley was taken to a hospital on the fairgrounds.Lilli Sentz, Medical History in Buffalo 1846‚Äì1996 Buffalo, NY: University at Buffalo Office of Publications p. 176 It took nearly 40 minutes for the first surgeon to show up. Herman Mynter, a general surgeon from Buffalo, was the first to diagnose the president. Not long after Mynter's examination was finished, Matthew Derbyshire Mann arrived. After the two talked, it was agreed upon to perform the abdominal exploration. President McKinley agreed to the exploration. Work was done by Mann to try to find the bullet and treat the wounds.Lilli Sentz, Medical History in Buffalo 1846‚Äì1996. Buffalo, NY: University at Buffalo Office of Publications p. 182 Efforts were made to contact Park, but he was in the middle of a neck dissection at Niagara Falls Memorial Hospital. As described years later by Park's son, the messenger ran into the operation room and told Park that he was needed immediately.Lilli Sentz, Medical History in Buffalo 1846‚Äì1996. Buffalo, NY: University at Buffalo Office of Publications p. 183 Park is claimed to have replied \\"Don't you see, I can't leave. I am in the middle of a case even if it were for the President of the United States?\\"; the messenger replied, \\"Doctor, it is for the President of the United States.\\" Park proceeded to finish the operation. Despite the importance of the situation, Park was only able to get to the exposition hospital via a train. The train engine and coal car were sent to Niagara Falls to pick him up and return to Buffalo, it held the record time between the two points at that time. The train was driven by Charles Meyers and was the only train allowed into the Pan Am. He was known after that as Pan American Charlie and died in 1934. Once Park arrived, Mann was about to close up McKinley and asked Park if there should be any placement of drains. Park told Mann that he was the best man to make that decision given the scenario. Mann decided not to drain the abdomen since there was no excess blood or fluid around to be drained.Lilli Sentz, Medical History in Buffalo 1846‚Äì1996.

It is at the old site of \\"Fort Hamilton\\", in the upper Palani hills. Compare Infobase Limited, Maps of India: Berijam lake Retrieved on 2007-12-27 The lake, created by a dam with sluice outlets, is part of a micro‚Äìwatershed development project. Periyakulam town, to the SE, gets its public drinking water from the lake. The lake's water quality is excellent.  Access  Old Fort Hamilton site at Berijam Lake Berijam is located at the end of Pillar Rocks Road (old SR-18), southwest of Kodaikanal Lake. map There were two roads from Berijam, the Kodaikanal‚ÄìMunnar Road to Munnar town, about west and another going to Kavunji village, north. The old roads are now overgrown with vegetation and used as walking trails by local villagers and trekkers. Encounters with wild animals including bison, elephants and leopards sometimes occur on these trails. The Tamil Nadu Forest Department has restricted entry into the Berijam Lake area to between 9.30 a.m. and 3 p.m. for the general public. Entry permits are issued at the Forestry Department Office in Kodaikanal. Only a limited number of visitors are allowed in the park each day. There is a forest check‚Äìpost which prohibits unauthorized entry through the road leading to Berijam Lake. Beyond km marker 13 on the Berijam road there is an observation tower from where one may have a fine view of Berijam Lake and the surrounding forest.5\\\\. Kodaikkanal ‚Äì Berijam (Easy walk) Berijam has a Forest Department Camp including an Eco-Education Center for visitors. Nature areas to be visited here include: swamp ecosystem, fresh water ecosystem, nature trail, bridge, medicinal demonstration garden, museum, nature walk, grassland and shola.(guide map) Site visits are organized for authorized researchers. Trekkers can get permission to stay overnight. There is a forest rest house with limited accommodations which serves as an overnight base camp for Forestry Department staff, researchers and trekkers. Visitors must bring their own provisions.  History  There was originally a swamp here known as the Berijam swamp. The previous existence here of a large lake, evidence of which was visible nearby, was first recorded in 1864 by Colonel Douglas Hamilton of the 21st Regiment of the Madras Native Infantry. No written record or even local legend regarding the existence of this ancient lake survives. However, judging from visible traces of its shoreline which still remained in 1906, it must have been nearly long, up to wide and up to deep. It was apparently formed by the side of a hill slipping down into a valley which slopes northwards, and damming up the stream which ran to the Amaravati River at the bottom of it. This stream apparently eventually cut its way through the huge natural embankment so formed, and thus emptied the lake this landslide/dam had once created. The dam was about long and the breach in it was about across and deep. In 1864, Colonel Hamilton submitted a report stating that the Berijam Lake area was the best site in the Palani Hills for a military cantonment or Sanatorium. A military outpost later built here, Fort Hamilton, was named for him. There was in fact no 'fort' at the place, only a small hut. Berijam lake was artificially created in 1867, when Sir Vere Levigne, Collector of Madurai, donated part of his personal retirement funds for building the dam. Subsequently, the dam and reservoir were enlarged and a pipeline was built to supply drinking water to the Periyakulam Municipality. The scheme was completed in 1912 at a cost equivalent to US$138,500. Berijam has a 100-year-old 2-story brick building, partly damaged and blackened over the years, with a bright yellow painted name reading \\"Britisher's Transit Camp\\". This is one of several transit camps built every for the soldiers to rest along the British \\"Escape Route\\" from Kodaikanal via Top Station and Munnar to Kochi, built during World War II. While most of the transit camps are now either dilapidated or demolished, the one at Berijam still stands. Berijam Lake has been studied palynologically revealing a 20,000 years story by pollen particles deposited in lake sediments. The time span between 20,000-17,000 years before present (B.P.) experienced cold and dry climatic conditions. After this period arid oxidizing environmental conditions prevailed for a period of 2500 years. The time span between 14,500‚Äì7;000 years B.P. witnessed a climatic amelioration phase leading to a warm and humid climate. From about 7,000 years B.P. to present the area has had a cool and humid climate.  Hydrology  The Upper Palani Hills catchment basin drains into the Lake. Rainfall is the chief source of water into the lake. Average annual rainfall in the hill area is . The mean day temperature in the coolest months is below in the higher areas. The lake is formed below the Palani hill ranges at the origin of the Varahanadhi (Varaha River) which is used for purposes of water supply and irrigation. As a part of the World Bank funded Water Resources Consolidation Project (WRCP) of Tamil Nadu, sedimentation condition was assessed for a large number of reservoirs including Berijam reservoir. This indicated that the gross storage capacity of the reservoir in 1911 decreased to in 1987. The percentage reduction of storage due to siltation is 23%, over a period of 76 years. Berijam Lake had stable land conditions, thus erosion was less and the lake received less sediment but more organic matter in the proportion of (5.5‚Äì41.8%). The rate of sedimentation is indirectly proportional to the influx of organic matter. ;Water quality On the basis of chemical parameters and nutrient load studies, the Berijam lake has been categorized as oligotrophic with a tendency to eutrophication over time due to plankton growth in the lake. This conclusion is supported by oxygen deficits in the bottom due to the chemocline condition of the lake.  Flora  Berijam is rich in flora and fauna (some are pictured in the gallery) and has a few original eco‚Äìinitiatives to its credit, namely, South India's first field‚Äìoriented eco-education centre set up by the Forest Department, an exclusive medicinal plants demonstration gardenKODAIKKANAL FOREST DIVISION , Dindigul District spread over and a model swamp observation area created to educate the public. A rare species of free floating insectivorous bladderwort plant called utricularia australis is said to be found here. The catchment of the Berijam Lake in the Palani hills falls under the once extensive shola grassland ecosystem, also called the \\"cloud forest\\". These grasslands constitute a complex and highly diverse plant community which in turn supports a wide range of fauna from insects to large mammals. With the sholas they constitute one of the world's rarest, most biodiverse and spectacular of landscapes. Where the grassland has been destroyed by industrial timber plantations, streams and marshes have dried out. Data on germination and cultivation of c. 250 shola species and long term biographies of c. 70 shola tree species in the area have been published. ;Medicinal flora Development and cultivation of medicinal plants like Digitalis, Pyrethrum, belladona, Dioscorea sp. and Mentha is an active programme launched by the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University through the research centre of the Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CIMAP) near Berijam. Commercial marketing of high yielding varieties of these plants is now being actively pursued. Psilocybin mushrooms which produce hallucinogenic effects when consumed, and other species of mushrooms grow around Berijam.  Fauna  thumb250pxSign board at Berijam lake meaning: \\"Let us also Live\\" The Upper Palni Shola forest reserve surrounding Berijam lake has a rich faunal population comprising the following. ;Avifauna * Resident birds include crested serpent eagles, pariah kites, pale-rumped swallows and the edible-nest swiftlets. * Migratory birds wintering here include the common rosefinch, the blue chat, several leaf-warblers and Blyth's reed-warbler. ;Mammals Map of Upper Palani Reserve Forest area where the elephant corridors are proposed * Threatened mammals including bison, Nilgiri langur, Malabar giant squirrels and Indian elephants are seen here as well as Indian crested porcupines, wild boar, barking deer, sambar deer and mouse deer. In February 2010, tigers were sighted in Kodaikanal forests during a six-day carnivore survey. A tigress and her cub were spotted playing in the wild. Forest Department officials are studying survey data to estimate the local tiger population based on indirect evidence like pug marks, scats and scratches. Of the two wildlife corridors proposed for movement of Indian elephants in the Palani Hills Reserve Forest, the Berijam corridor connects to Top Station in Kerala. It is also being studied if a link corridor through the Kukkal area, could be established to the second corridor from Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary and National Park through Amaravathy and Kudhiraiyar to the Palar Dam, then up the valley almost to Ganesh Nagar, below Pethuparai village. ;Fish In 1886 there were carp in the lake. In 1914 there was a scheme to introduce trout into Berijam reservoir.  Conservation  ;Threats The catchment basin of the lake, historically dominated by extensive shola grass lands, drains into marshes at the head of the lake. However, most of the catchment area was afforested, during the 1960s, with eucalyptus, wattle and pine. The main Berijam marsh has shrunk, as evidenced in March 2007, by walking across the marsh without getting one's feet wet. This is attributed to less water discharging into the lake. Shrinking of the lake has also been noticed with the boating dock getting shifted to deeper waters on the opposite side of the creek. The creek waters adjoining the marsh have been gradually invaded by marshland vegetation of water lilies, torpedo grass and native sedges with shoots in water and roots at the nodes. The water lilies were planted there \\"reportedly\\" for ornamental purposes by the Forest Department. These marshland invasives are accelerating the siltation process and may eventually result in necessity of raising the height of the dam to compensate for loss of storage due to siltation. A crisis in the water regime of the Palani plateau has been observed at Berijam Lake. The lake's marshlands have been reported to dry out after the monsoon and marsh vegetation is seen encroaching into the deeper part of the lake. Near threatened grey-breasted laughingthrush Studies by the S√°lim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History, Coimbatore, undertaken in 2006 in many areas of the Palani hills including Berijam, indicate that the population of the grey-breasted laughingthrush, a near threatened endemic bird species of the Western Ghats, has been affected by the degradation of its habitat. Remedial measures have been suggested. Otter poaching in the Palani hills to the point of extermination has been reported. Common and small-clawed otters are trapped by tribals from the Haryana state of India, who are in Palani hills with the sole aim of collecting otter oil which is in demand in northern India. Mercury pollution was reported in Kodaikanal which affected lakes in the area. The causes, originating from a Hindustan Lever thermometer factory nearby, were reported to be dispersal of elemental mercury to the atmosphere from improper storage and dispersal from surface effluents from the factory. Apart from tests conducted on Kodaikanal lake, moss samples collected from trees surrounding the Berijam Lake, located from the factory were also tested. These showed mercury level in the range of 0.2 ¬µg/kg. In 1902, important bauxite deposits were discovered in the hills north and south of Berijam Lake which The Geological Survey of India investigated during 1964‚Äì65. ;Remedial measures The following measures have been suggested or are under implementation by various agencies. *Plastics, smoking and consuming alcohol are prohibited at the lake area. *Promote Shola grass land afforestation in the catchment area of the lake, particularly towards Mannavanur where its absence is noticed. This remedial measure could be ecologically and biologically beneficial to restore the lake's water source. *Grassland rehabilitation could be achieved, with NGO and community participation. The Vatakanal Conservation Trust, a non- governmental organization in association with the Tamil Nadu Forest Department has initiated efforts to restore the shola system. A pilot project was undertaken to protect the Pambar shola, adjacent to Kodaikanal. *Kurinji saplings associated with Shola grasslands and other native grasslands species have been successfully nurtured. *Excellent flowering of krunji flowers on the cliffs near Berijam Lake have been noted during August and September. Noting the effect on the breeding of the grey‚Äìbreasted laughingthrush, the S√°lim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History has recommended: *Expansion of plantations and restoration of grasslands and shola forests in the Palani hills should be halted *The larger shola forests of Kukkal and Mathikettan (Berijam) to be declared as bird sanctuaries with better protection for the proposed Palani Hills Wildlife Sanctuary and National Park. *Set up a GIS database with thematic details, including information on flora and fauna, to help monitor the globally near threatened species. *Initiate a nature education programme to highlight importance of natural vegetation in Habitat conservation of biodiversity and watershed management of Palani Hills.

Die swell occurs in instances of polymer extrusion, in which a stream of polymeric material is forced through a die, a specialized tool in manufacturing to shape or cut polymeric materials. Die swell is an instance where a polymer stream is compressed by entrance into a die, and is followed by a partial recovery or ‚Äúswell‚Äù back to the former shape and volume of the polymer after exiting the die, hence the term die swell. Die swell is a phenomenon directly related to entropy and the relaxation of the polymer within the flow stream. Initially, a flow stream has a constant rate before entering the die, and the polymers within the stream occupy a roughly spherical conformation, maximizing entropy. Extrusion through the die causes an increase in flow rate through the polymer flow stream. As the polymer spends time inside the die and is subject to the much increased flow rate, the polymers lose the spherical shape, becoming longer due to the increased flow rate. Physical entanglements may relax, if the time scale of the polymer within the die is long enough. When the polymer stream leaves the die, the remaining physical entanglements cause the polymers in the die stream to regain a portion of its former shape and spherical volume, in order to return to the roughly spherical conformation that maximizes entropy.Hiemenz, Paul C., and Tim Lodge. Polymer Chemistry. 2nd ed. New York: CRC, 2007. The disentanglement of polymer chains is a kinetic process, and so the longer the die is, the more time is given for the physical entanglements within the polymer stream to disentangle. With a longer die and a slower polymer flow stream, less pronounced die swell will be observed. This is due to the longer die providing a longer time period for polymer, when subject to the increase flow rate, to disentangle. This characteristic relaxation time determines the length of time the polymer must spend inside the die to minimize die swell.

He was the creator of Mizoram People's Conference, one of the major political parties in Mizoram. He was a recipient of Ati Vishisht Seva Medal (AVSM) and Padma Shri for his humanitarian works during his military service, and Mizo Award for his lifetime achievements. T. Sailo was the son of Vanchheuva, a Mizo chief of ·π¨huampui village at Lunglei district. He studied at Serkawn Middle English School, Shillong High School (in Meghalaya), and Serampore College in Calcutta (now Kolkata). He earned his certificate of Intermediate of Science (higher secondary level) from the University of Calcutta. He immediately joined the British Army to serve in World War II. Recruited as Second Lieutenant in 1942, he became the first military officer among the Mizo people. He retired with the rank Brigadier in 1974. By then his native state was ravaged by political insurgency, and he soon set to humanitarian works and established the Human Right Committee, which he developed into a recognized political party named People's Conference (later renamed the Mizo People's Conference) in 1975. T. Sailo led his new party to victory in the Mizoram Legislative Assembly election in 1978, and he became the second Chief Minister. Re-election the next year also brought him the same victory and remained the Chief Minister till 1984. Though he was elected for MLA seat in the 1984 election, his party was overwhelmed by the Mizoram Congress party (under the Indian National Congress Party). He was appointed the Opposition Leader in the legislative assembly. He was subsequently elected in 1998 and 2008 but failed to uplift his party. He retired from politics in 2013, and at age 91 he was by then the oldest elected legislator. Early life and education T. Sailo was born to Mizo Chief Vancheuva and his wife Hrangvungi. He completed his elementary schooling from Serkawn Middle School in Lunglei, and was the topper in the Middle School Leaving Certificate examination under the Mizoram Board of School Education. He then went on to High School in Shillong from 1937 to 1940. He then went on to study Intermediate of Science (higher secondary education) in Serampore College in 1941. The next year he earned his certificate under the University of Calcutta Army career At the height of World War II, T. Sailo joined the Indian Army, which was under the British Army, as a Second Lieutenant in 1942. He became the first military officer among the Mizo people. After the Independence of India, he was promoted to Lt Colonel in 1960, in 1963 he was again promoted to Colonel, and then in 1966 to Brigadier until his retirement in 1974. Politics After retiring from Army, T. Sailo created the Human Rights Committee in 1974 fighting for alleged Army excess against civilian's caught in the separatist conflict between the Indian Army and Mizo National Front. He submitted a memorandum containing 36 cases of atrocities by the Indian Army since 1 March 1966. To fight his cause in the political arena, he founded the People's Conference Party (later to be renamed Mizo People's Conference) on 17 April 1975. His party won the Mizoram Legislative Assembly election of 1978, and he became the second Chief Minister of Mizoram on 2 June 1978. Due to political unrest, his government was dissolved after six months in November, and the Union Territory was declared under President's Rule. In the next election in 1979, his party won again and he once again became the Chief Minister, the post he held for full term till 1984. In the 1984 election, although he was elected in his constituency, his party was defeated by the Indian National Congress Party led by Lal Thanhawla. He became the Opposition Leader. His party felt a serious blow with the Mizoram Peace Accord of 1987, as the Mizo National Front emerged not only as a new political party, but also was offered the government as part of the peace negotiation. For a short while, he changed the party's name to Mizoram Janata Dal but renamed it to reflect its old name Mizoram People's Conference. In the government formed after the 1998 elections, he was part of the ruling coalition led by the Chief Minister Zoramthanga of the Mizo National Front. He was appointed Principal Adviser to the state government. His ministry has also initiated the Aizawl city extension project, Bairabi Dam which he alleged were never pursued by the successive governments. T. Sailo was again elected in the 2008 election and as his last term as Member of the Legislative Assembly ended in January 2014, he retired. He announced his formal retirement at the assembly session on 24 July 2013. At age 92, he was allegedly the oldest elected member of any legislative body in the world. Awards and honours T. Sailo was given the military award Ati Vishisht Seva Medal (AVSM) during his service. He was awarded the Padma Shree in 1999 by the Government of India. In 2001 the Mizo Zirlai Pawl declared him as a corruption-free politician from their public poll. On April 2011, the then Governor of Mizoram, Lt. Gen. Madan Mohan Lakhera, awarded him with the Mizo Award organised by the Vanglaini daily newspaper in Mizoram. Personal life and death T. Sailo married Thansiami, daughter of a Mizo folklorist P.S. Dahrawka, in 1946. They had three sons, Lalsangliana Sailo, Lalhmangaiha Sailo, and Lalrinliana Sailo; and a daughter Laldingliani Sailo. Though a son of an Indian Army officer, Lalsangliana joined the Mizo rebels, the Mizo National Army (later Mizo National Front), on the sly while studying graduate course at St. Edmund's College, Shillong, in 1966. He became one of the elite \\"Special Force\\" under Laldenga, leader of the MNA. Lalhmangaiha and Laldingliani both entered the Indian Revenue Service..

GAFNC teams currently play in the Bellarine Football League.  History  The Geelong Amateur Football Club was formed in 1926 as a result of teachers and students from The Geelong College and The Geelong Grammar forming a football team to play in Victorian Amateur Football Association. Hence the green (College)and light blue (Grammar) colors and the Pegasus Logo of the club. They moved to their current home at Queens Park, Highton in 1957. They started in the VAFA participating as high as A Grade before in 1983 the club decided to base itself in Geelong and joined the Geelong and District Football League. Playing in the V.A.F.A. meant travelling to Melbourne every fortnight, whereas joining the Geelong & District Football League meant that all games were played locally. In 1985 they won the GDFL premiership. The club then briefly went up to the Geelong Football League but was unable to sustain itself there and moved back to the GDFL in 1989. The club experienced a period of troubled times over the next few years and, after much soul searching and survival meetings, the club joined the Bellarine Football League and has remained since.

Released theatrically on November 3, 1959, the film was produced by Walter Lantz Productions and distributed by Universal International. Synopsis The final (and championship) baseball game of the Kiddie League pits pitcher Woody Woodpecker and his team (the Woody Woodpeckers) against a zany team, the Bubble Gummers. The game begins with the Bubble Gummers at bat and Woody pitching. A little tyke wearing diapers is first up. Before batting, he gulps down a bottle of milk for strength. The first ball is called a strike. A bottle hits the umpire on the head. In the altercation that follows, the large spectator who threw the bottle is amply taken care of by the small umpire. With plenty of action, the first inning ends with no score. And so- to the ninth inning- still no score. With Dooley pitching, Woody hits the first ball clear out of the ballpark. Dooley catches it, leaning far out on the end of a flagpole, which breaks just as the catch is made. He disappears as the umpire, looking through a telescope, calls it foul ball. The game ends in a riot as cushions, bottles, etc. are hurled at the umpire, and the spectators enter into a free-for-all melee. The picture ends with the broadcaster trying to explain things as bottles and cushions whiz around his microphone. Notes This marks one of the earliest appearances of Inspector Willoughby. He has a cameo as a baseball umpire. References *Cooke, Jon, Komorowski, Thad, Shakarian, Pietro, and Tatay, Jack. \\"1959\\". The Walter Lantz Cartune Encyclopedia.

The game featured the Michigan Wolverines beating the Washington Huskies by a score of 23-6\\\\. The game marked the first time Michigan Coach Bo Schembechler won a bowl game after seven prior bowl game losses. The matchup The 1981 Rose Bowl matched the Big Ten Conference and Pacific-10 Conference champions. Both teams, Michigan from the Big Ten, and Washington from the Pac-10, came into the game with identical 9‚Äì2 regular season records. Michigan had lost games against Notre Dame and South Carolina, and Washington had lost to Oregon and Navy. Washington came into the game having won the Pac-10 title with a 20‚Äì10 upset victory over USC. Despite the identical records, Michigan was favored, due largely to the impressive play of its defense. The Michigan defense did not allow a touchdown in the last 18 quarters of the regular season and gave up only 10 first-quarter points and three touchdown passes all year. The streak included a shutout of a Purdue team led by quarterback Mark Herrmann and a victory over Ohio State in which the Buckeye offense led by Art Schlichter was held to three points. Washington Coach Don James noted, \\"Michigan is playing defense so much better than anybody else in the country right now.\\" Michigan's defense was led by co-captain and linebacker, Andy Cannavino, who led the team with 160 tackles (54 more than any other player on the team) to become the second leading all-time tackler in the school's history. The defense also featured linebacker, Mel Owens, tackle, Mike Trgovac, and safety Keith Bostic. On offense, Michigan had All-American wide receiver, Anthony Carter, who broke the school's career record for touchdowns as a sophomore. Prior to the 1981 Rose Bowl, Schembechler called Carter \\"the most gifted athlete I've ever been around.\\" Michigan also featured an offensive line that included All-American George Lilja and future NFL players, Ed Muransky, Kurt Becker, and Bubba Paris. Washington was led by senior quarterback and Pac-10 Player of the Year, Tom Flick, who had passed for 2,178 yards in 1980. Washington also had a superb placekicker, Chuck Nelson, who led the team in scoring with 85 points on 31 extra points and 18 field goals. Don James noted that the biggest difference between the two teams was Washington's reliance on the passing game, and Michigan's reliance on the run. Pre-game focus on Schembechler's bowl record Michigan's long-time coach Bo Schembechler was the focus of much of the pre-game press coverage. Schembechler had gone winless in seven prior bowl games (five Rose Bowls, one Orange Bowl, and one Gator Bowl). Bo's record led to jokes by the media, including one Gannett reporter who opened his pre- game story by noting: \\"It's bowl time, so they're playing Michigan's song again. No not The Victors, you know, Taps.\\" And a UPI story opened with this line: \\"Why doesn't Bo Schembechler eat cereal for breakfast? He's afraid he'd lose the bowl.\\" Michigan's players noted their desire to win the 1981 Rose Bowl for their coach. All-American center George Lilja noted, \\"We want to win for our coach as much as for ourselves.\\" Michigan's co-captain, Andy Cannavino joked, \\"If we win, maybe it'll look good on our resume when we go in to apply for a regular job. Maybe the boss will be sympathetic to the fact that we got Bo Schembechler his first Rose Bowl.\\" The press also noted that, even though Michigan's players wanted \\"desperately\\" to win for their coach, Schembechler himself \\"seems as laid back as a native Californian.\\" Schembechler refused to predict a victory but said, \\"The pressure is on us to win, but I guarantee you, our players will play their hearts out.\\" Game summary Early in the game, Washington reached the Michigan one-yard line, but the Michigan defense stopped Washington's Toussaint Tyler on fourth down. One official initially signaled a touchdown, but changed the call after the other official reported \\"he clearly saw the ball was not in.\\" The first quarter ended with no score, and the highlights of the first quarter were Michigan's goal-line stand and a Rose Bowl record set by Michigan's Don Bracken with a 73-yard punt. In the second quarter, Washington's placekicker Chuck Nelson kicked a 35-yard field goal, but Michigan then took the lead with a six-yard touchdown run by Butch Woolfolk. Nelson added a 26-yard field goal, and the half ended with Michigan leading 7‚Äì6. Michigan drove the ball 83-yard to start the second half, scoring on a 25-yard field goal from placekicker Ali Haji-Sheikh. After the game, Schembechler said the opening drive of the second half was the \\"turning point.\\" He noted, \\"To take the kick and drive down the field on them, I think might have taken something out of them.\\" In the third quarter, Michigan's quarterback John Wangler completed a seven-yard touchdown pass to All-American wide receiver Anthony Carter, and Michigan led 17‚Äì6. Michigan added another touchdown in the fourth quarter on a one-yard run by Stan Edwards. The Michigan defense shut down the Washington offense in the second half, not allowing the Huskies to score. The Wolverines outgained the Huskies 304 yards to 105 in the second half. Butch Woolfolk was named the Most Valuable Player of the 1981 Rose Bowl after rushing for 182 yards in 26 carries. Stan Edwards added 68 rushing yards, and Anthony Carter compiled 101 yards of total offense (33 rushing, 68 receiving). Despite allowing Washington to gain 374 total yards of offense in the game (including 282 yards passing by Flick), Michigan extended its streak to 22 quarters without giving up a touchdown. =Scoring=Second Quarter * Wash ‚Äì Nelson, 35-yard field goalHistorical Media Guide, Pasadena Tournament of Roses, 2009 * Mich ‚Äì Woolfolk, 6-yard run (Haji-Sheikh kick good) * Wash ‚Äì Nelson, 26-yard field goal Third Quarter * Mich ‚Äì Haji-Sheikh, 25-yard field goal * Mich ‚Äì Carter, 7-yard pass from Wangler (Haji-Sheikh kick good) Fourth Quarter * Mich ‚Äì Edwards, 1-yard run (Haji-Sheikh kick failed) Post-game press coverage As had the pre-game coverage, much of the post-game coverage focused on Bo Schembechler, who had \\"broken the jinx\\" by winning his first bowl game after seven straight defeats. After the game, the Michigan players carried Schembechler off the field on their shoulders as the coach held his arms above his head in victory. In the post-game press conference, Schembechler said, \\"I stood here five times before a loser. Now I'm smoking a cigar and smiling. ... Right now, I'm on top of the world. I feel great about everything.\\" Michigan finished the season ranked No. 4 in both the AP and UPI polls‚Äîtheir highest ranking in any season under Schembechler in which they won the Rose Bowl. (Michigan finished No. 3 in 1976 after losing the Rose Bowl, No. 2 in 1985 after winning the Fiesta Bowl, and No. 4 again in 1988 after Schembechler's only other Rose Bowl victory. Schembechler finished 2‚Äì8 in Rose Bowls and never won a national championship in his 21 seasons as head coach.). It was Michigan's first bowl win in sixteen years, since January 1965. The win broke the Pac-10's six-game winning streak in the Rose Bowl; it was only the second win for the Big Ten in the last twelve, and the Pac-10 won the next six.

She was replaced by the Brown Dots. Legacy There has been a revival of interest in the film in recent years due to the prominence of its black cast. Donald Bogle wrote that the race films of the late 1940s succeeded as \\"fundamental celebrations of cultural roots and communal spirits and also as pure, undiluted celebrations of black style. Such movies as Broken Strings, Boy! What a Girl! (1946), Sepia Cinderella (1947), Bronze Buckeroo, and scores of others introduced a new rhythm to American cinema. Vocal inflections and intonations set the ears abuzz. The manners, gestures, postures, surprising double takes, swift interplay and communication between the characters is a world unto itself, capturing, despite whatever other distortions or failings, a segment of black American life and culture.\\" See also * List of films in the public domain in the United States ReferencesExternal links * *Boy!

The goal of Water For South Sudan (WFSS) is to increase the quality of life and health of families in South Sudan by drilling wells to provide fresh, safe potable water, and improving hygiene and sanitation practices in areas of great need. History The history of the organization centers on its founder, Salva Dut. In 1985, Sudan was wracked by the Second Sudanese Civil War. Millions died and millions more were displaced, fleeing to refugee camps in Ethiopia, Kenya and other neighboring countries. Finally, in 2005, after over two decades of war, the Comprehensive Peace Agreement was signed. A truce was declared and the semi-autonomous Government of Southern Sudan was established for that region. Among those who originally fled through barren, war-torn southern desert were thousands of children, mostly boys, some as young as five. They became known as the \\"Lost Boys of Sudan.\\" Salva Dut was one of those boys. As an 11-year-old Dinka from Tonj in southwest Sudan, Dut fled first to Ethiopia. Then, as a teenager, he led 1500 \\"Lost Boys\\" hundreds of miles through the southern Sudan desert to the Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya. Relocated to Rochester NY USA in 1996, he now leads Water For South Sudan. Organization Salva Dut founded Water For South Sudan in 2003 as a non-profit organization. In 2005 , drilling operations began. Five wells were drilled in Sudanese villages in the first year. Since then, over 350 wells have been drilled, each serving approximately 1,000-1,500 people. It costs WFSS approximately $15,000 per well which includes ALL costs related to drilling such as overhead (less than 20%). People in the villages where (WFSS) operates become partners in the process of making safe, drinkable water available there. The WFSS team trains the well manager and provides spare parts. Each village where WFSS drills also receives a three-day hygiene education program taught by one of two hygiene teams at WFSS. Key topics include personal hygiene, safe water practices, food safety, safe disposal of waste and women's hygiene. Operations Water for South Sudan's operations teams, based in Wau, work in remote villages in the Bahr el Ghazal region in South Sudan. Drilling a borehole, often hundreds of feet deep to reach the aquifer‚Äôs water, is a technical challenge. That challenge is magnified by the remote nature and harsh climate of the region. The drilling rig requires water to operate. Gravel of a certain size and shape for use in the borehole must be located. Compressed air must be available. Soil must be tested and retested to measure progress. Diesel fuel is required at all times as is a special polymer to keep the borehole intact until pipe is sunk for the well. And of course, the crew must be fed every day of the drilling season.

The Bulletin is owned by EO Media Group, which prior to January 2013 was named the East Oregonian Publishing Company. Over the years, a number of well-known journalists have been associated with the newspaper. HistoryEstablishment= To start a newspaper in Bend, a printing press and other publishing equipment items were brought overland from the railhead at Shaniko by freight wagon. The Bend Bulletin was first published as a weekly newspaper on March 27, 1903. At the time, Bend was a mere hamlet in what was then part of Crook County. The newspaper's first publisher was Max Lueddemann with Don P. Rea serving as the first editor. When it began, the newspaper's only other employee was a printer named A. H. Kennedy. The newspaper office was located in a rustic cabin on the east bank of the Deschutes River. In the summer of 1904, the newspaper was sold to J. M. Lawrence. He moved the newspaper to an office building in downtown Bend.Brogan, Phil F., East of the Cascades (Third Edition), Binford & Mort, Portland, 1965, pp. 213‚Äì215. In that year it consolidated with the Deschutes Echo, which had been launched in 1902 in the neighboring hamlet of Deschutes (now part of the city of Bend). =Ownership transitions= The Bend Bulletin, March 3, 1909 In 1910, George P. Putnam bought the Bend Bulletin from Lawrence. While he was the newspaper's editor for only four years, Putnam continued as publisher for several more years. During his tenure, Putnam was active in local and state politics and the newspaper began promoting Central Oregon outside the local area. In 1916, Deschutes County was carved out of Crook County; a campaign led by the Bulletin was at least partially responsible.

Robert W. Sawyer purchased Putnam's interest in the newspaper in 1919. He hired Henry Fowler, who owned a minority share in the newspaper, as editor. Sawyer was a conservationist, who used his influence as a newspaper publisher to help preserve Oregon's natural resources. In addition to publishing the Bend Bulletin, he served as president of the National Reclamation Association, a director of the American Forestry Association, and a member of the Oregon Highway Commission. He also championed the establishment of numerous state parks as well as leading the effort to preserve key portions of the John Day Fossil Beds. Sawyer continued as publisher of the Bend Bulletin for 34 years. In 1953, Sawyer put the newspaper up for sale. He received offers from several large newspaper chains, but eventually sold the newspaper to Robert Chandler. To make the purchase affordable, Sawyer only required a $6,000 down payment.Lang, William L., \\"Robert Sawyer (1880‚Äì1959)\\",The Oregon Encyclopedia, Portland State University and the Oregon Historical Society, Portland.

Chandler ran the newspaper for the next 43 years, first as The Bend Bulletin and after 1963 as The Bulletin. During his tenure, Chandler brought new technology into the newspaper's operation. Soon after he bought the paper, he expanded the photoengraving facilities. In 1956, he replaced the paper's flatbed press with a new rotary press that printed 13,000 32-page sections per hour. The new press also allowed the paper to print photographs in color. In 1966, The Bulletin moved to a new building on Hill Street in the southern part of Bend. As part of the move, a new offset press was installed. The new press ended the need to produce hot-lead cast type. It also improved the quality of the newspaper's photographs. That same year, The Bulletin began using wire service photos to supplement photographs taken by the paper's staff photographers. In the 1970s, the newspaper installed video display terminals to receive electronic feeds from the wire services. The video displays were replaced with computers a few years later. A new Goss Urbanite offset press was installed in 1980. This new system could print 20,000 sections an hour. In 1988, three reporters were arrested for criminal trespass for attempting to get the records of hotel-motel taxes from the Deschutes County Commissioners.Thomas, Dick. \\"Opening the public files\\", The Oregonian, February 23, 1992, Forum, p. C7. The Commissioners denied access to the records and the reporters were never prosecuted. The Bulletin created its website, bendbulletin.com, in 1996. In 2014, the newspaper's circulation was 26,986 for the Monday‚ÄìFriday edition, 27,253 for Saturday, and 27,599 for Sunday. =Bankruptcy and sale= The Bulletin‚Äôs former parent company , Western Communications, went through an initial Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2011-2012. Western Communications filed for a second round of Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection again in January 2019. Western Communications filed documents in U..S.

A group of private investors based in Bend maintain a minority stake in ownership of the two Bend-area publications. Notable editors Since its founding, The Bulletin has had a number of distinguished publishers, including George P. Putnam, Robert W. Sawyer, and Robert W. Chandler. All three of these newspapermen are honored in the Oregon Newspaper Hall of Fame. Putnam and Sawyer were inducted in 1980, shortly after the Hall of Fame was created by the Oregon Newspaper Publishers Association. Chandler was inducted in 2006.Oregon Newspaper Hall of Fame , Oregon Newspaper Publishers Association, Portland. Retrieved 23 August 2013. Phil Brogan was another well-known journalist associated with The Bulletin. He was hired by Sawyer in 1923, and worked as a reporter, writer, and editor for the next 44 years, earning numerous awards for his work. He was also a distinguished historian, geologist, paleontologist, geographer, meteorologist, astronomer, and outdoorsman. In 1964, Brogan wrote East of the Cascades, an important source of information on the geology, geography, and history of Central Oregon.Friedman, Ralph, A Touch of Oregon, Pars Publishing Company, Portland, Oregon, 1970, pp. 110‚Äì116.United Press International, \\"Phil Brogan retired editor, dead at 87\\", Eugene Register-Guard, 1 June 1983, p. 2A.

He was the leader of the Newfoundland Democratic Party and the first leader of the Newfoundland New Democratic Party. Early years Finn was born in Spaniard's Bay, Newfoundland and raised in Corner Brook. His father worked at the Bowater's paper mill during the Great Depression. In 1942, Finn joined his father at the paper mill at the age of 16 and worked there for four years. He went into journalism working for Corner Brook's local newspaper, The Western Star from 1946 to 1953, when he went to work for the Montreal Gazette for two years before returning to the Star as editor. Logger's strike Under his stewardship The Western Star sympathetically covered the Newfoundland logger's strike of 1958-59. Finn later wrote of the period \\"It was such a heated and emotionally charged labour dispute that journalistic objectivity was simply not tolerated... you were either with the paper companies and the government, or you were with a gang of mainland union thugs, which was how the International Woodworkers' of America (IWA) leaders were unfairly depicted.\\" Newfoundland Premier Joey Smallwood responded to the labour dispute by introducing legislation to decertify the International Woodworkers of America and also used police to harass picket lines. Finn, as editor of the Western Star, war ordered by the newspaper's publishers to report only the company's and government's side of the dispute. As a result, Finn and two other journalists quit the newspaper. He and two friends started their own newspaper, The Newfoundland Examiner with Finn as publisher and editor and devoted the journal to uncovering government and business corruption. The newspaper was unable to attract advertising revenue and folded after a year. Political career As a result of the strike, labour unions with the support of the Canadian Labour Congress founded the Newfoundland Democratic Party in 1959 in an attempt to give political expression to the growing workers movement and in an attempt to channel worker opposition to the Liberal government of Joey Smallwood. The new party absorbed the small Newfoundland section of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation and anticipated the 1961 founding of the New Democratic Party (NDP) of Canada by the Canadian Labour Congress and the CCF. After being fired by his publisher, Finn was hired by the Canadian Labour Congress and persuaded to lead the Newfoundland Democratic Party into the 1959 provincial election. Smallwood sent his Minister of Labour, Charlie Ballam, to run against Finn in Humber West. Finn came within less than 300 votes of defeating Ballam. He remained leader of the Newfoundland Democratic Party, which became the Newfoundland New Democratic Party, until 1963 and ran in the 1962 provincial election as well as for the federal NDP in Humber‚ÄîSt. George's in the 1962 and 1963 federal elections but was unable to win a seat in either the Newfoundland House of Assembly or the House of Commons of Canada. Later career In 1963, Finn resigned as NDP leader and moved to Ottawa to accept a position with the Canadian Brotherhood of Railway, Transport and General Workers. He remained with that union until 1980 when he and three other union staffers were dismissed after they refused to open mail during a strike by the union's clerical staff. He then joined the Canadian Union of Public Employees with whom he remained until his retirement in 1991. Finn also wrote a weekly labour column for the Toronto Star from 1968 until 1982 and has also contributed articles to various publications. He has worked for the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives since 1993 and is currently editor of its monthly journal, The CCPA Monitor. The CCPA has published several collections of Finn's essays in three books, The Right is Wrong and the Left Is Right - Cutting through the Neoliberal Bafflegab, Under Corporate Rule and Who Do We Try to Rescue Today?. The CCPA publishes books, research studies, reports, and provides media commentary. Its flagship publication is the CCPA Monitor which was founded and previously edited by Ed Finn.

During this time, the cutter is tasked with replacing traditional channel markers with winter markers, which are more capable of handling the extreme conditions seen in the Great Lakes during the winter months. During the winter months, CGC Mobile Bay detaches from the ATON barge and is largely responsible for ice breaking in the Northern Great Lakes in order to maintain an operable level of maritime commerce in the region. This time period often lasts from December to Mid- April. During the spring months, CGC Mobile Bay once again is responsible for aids to navigation work. At this time, the cutter will replace the buoys set in the fall with the traditional channel markers, since the winter months will have ended.

Lawhead, based on the Robin Hood legend. Lawhead relocates Robin Hood from Sherwood Forest in Nottingham to Wales, and sets the story in the late eleventh century, after the Battle of Hastings and to coincide with the Norman invasion of Wales and the struggles the Cymry (Welsh) people against the Normans, and the political intrigue of medieval Britain. The trilogy consists of three books named Hood, Scarlet, and Tuck. The King Raven series continued his themes of reimagining popular mythology into more authentic and gritty settings, which began with his Pendragon Cycle. NovelsHood= Hunted like an animal by Norman invaders, Bran ap Brychan, heir to the throne Elfael, has abandoned his father's kingdom and fled to the greenwood. There, in the primeval forest of the Welsh borders, danger surrounds him‚Äîfor this woodland is a living, breathing entity with mysterious powers and secrets, and Bran must find a way to make it his own if he is to survive. Through the suffering of his pride-torn soul and the land of ancestors being destroyed by powerful forces, Bran envisions the dangerous paths in which his ambition is drawn, and soon succumbs to his fate. The book was dedicated to the Schloss Mittersill Community in Austria, which he and his wife were part of for a couple of years. =Scarlet= After losing everything he owns, forester Will Scarlet embarks on a search for King Raven, whose exploits have already become legendary. After fulfilling his quest‚Äîand proving himself a skilled and loyal companion‚ÄîWill joins the heroic archer and his men. However, Scarlet is captured and imprisoned for being a follower of the rebel Raven. He is sentenced to death by hanging‚Äîunless he delivers King Raven and his band of cohorts. That, of course, he will never do. Simultaneously, Wales is slowly falling under the control of the invading Normans, and King William the Red has given his ruthless barons control of the land. In desperation, the people turn to King Raven and his men for justice and survival in the face of the ever-growing onslaught. In 2008, Scarlet won a Christy Award in the category of Visionary Fiction. =Tuck= The story of Rhi Bran y Hud concludes as Abbot Hugo and the Norman invaders attempt to wipe out King Raven and his flock once and for all. Their merciless attack, the first of many to come, heralds a dark and desperate day for the realm of Elfael. Bran and his few stalwarts desperately need encouragement and reinforcement if they are to survive. Bran and Friar Tuck, a most unconventional priest, ride north to rally the tribes of Wales to the fight, making new friends, and even more powerful enemies along the way. Tuck, the final installment of the trilogy, was released on January 22, 2009. =Publication history=  * * Reception The Raven King Trilogy has enjoyed a largely positive response from readers, scoring an average of 3.96 out of 5 stars by GoodReads reviewers (Hood - 3.86/5 stars, 93% of people like; Scarlet - 3.97/5 stars, 96% of people like; Tuck - 4.05/5 stars, 96% of people like), and an average of 4.4 out of 5 stars by reviewers on Amazon.com (Hood - 4.3/5 stars; Scarlet - 4.4/5 stars; Tuck - 4.5/5 stars).

Early life He was born in Chingford in 1922 and attended Clacton County High School and Queen Mary, University of London, where he studied Modern Languages. World War Two His studies were interrupted by World War II, and he volunteered in 1941, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Irish Fusiliers on 20 February 1943. He worked as an interpreter on various convoys, including one marked H9 carrying 2000 Russian refugees to Odessa despite the fact that, at the time, he did not speak fluent Russian. It was later revealed that he should have been sent on a course to learn the language beforehand but never was due to a bureaucratic error, and as a result the men were \\"quite unmanageable\\" until the convoy reached Naples and a Red Army officer boarded. Diplomatic service Experiences with convoys during the war inspired Keeble to apply to join Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service, and he was accepted in 1947, and posted to Jakarta as acting vice-consul despite the normal requirement for applicants to have a university degree. His main task while serving there was to decipher coded messages arriving from the British ambassador at The Hague, something the staff did with only pencils and cipher books. In 1949 he returned to London, and on 2 March 1949 he formally relinquished his army commission, receiving the honorary rank of captain. In 1951 he was sent to the Berlin British Sector as deputy political advisor. In 1954 he was transferred yet again, this time to Washington to serve in the commercial department and again in 1958 back to London. In 1961 he was appointed head of the department negotiating the entry of Britain into the European Economic Community, something that failed due to clashes with the French. He was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 1970 New Year Honours, at the time he was serving at the British High Commission in Australia. In 1971 he returned to London again as assistant under-secretary and handled negotiations with Iceland during the second Cod War. On 16 January 1974 he was posted again to East Germany as Ambassador, where despite requesting a subdued colour for his official car he was given one that was bright red. According to him this later proved key, however; when Leonid Brezhnev was introduced to the British diplomatic staff he expressed amazement at Keeble's height (5 ft 9 in) telling him it did not do justice to his country, but \\"the situation was rapidly restored by the red Daimler\\". He was posted again in 1976 back to London, where he served as Chief Clerk at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. On 28 March 1978 he was posted to Moscow as the British Ambassador to Russia, where he would form close ties with his opposite number, Andrei Gromyko, and he was promoted to Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the Queen's Birthday Honours. He retired in 1982, at which point he was given a tour of a private part of the Kremlin; a mark of the regard the Russians held him in. He was also promoted Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) in the Birthday Honours. Retirement After retirement he continued to be involved in foreign affairs, serving as an adviser to the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee and from 1985 as chairman of the Great Britain-USSR Association. In 1985 he also became a governor of the BBC, and from 1992 he served as chairman of the Foundation for Accountancy and Financial Management. He was a director of one of Gerald Carroll's Carroll Group companies.\\"SFO looks at 500m fall of Carroll empire\\", Dominic O'Connell, Sunday Business, 1 October 2000, p. 1. Personal life While serving in World War II, he met his future wife Margaret Fraser, with whom he had three daughters: Suzanne, a doctor; Sally Keeble, a Member of Parliament for Northampton North constituency from 1997 to 2010; and Jane Keeble, who was killed on 12 July 1998 in a car accident.

Tube testers evolved along with the vacuum tube to satisfy the demands of the time, and their evolution ended with the tube era. The first tube testers were simple units designed for specific tubes to be used in the battlefields of World War I by radio operators, so they could easily test the tubes of their communication equipment. Types of tube testersModern testers= The most modern testers perform a multitude of the below tests and are fully automated. Examples of modern testers include the Amplitrex AT1000, the Space-Tech Lab EasyTubeTester, the Maxi pre-amp tester and the maxi-matcher (power tubes only) by maxi test and the new, and somewhat more primitive, DIVO VT1000 by Orange Amplification. While the AT1000, EasyTubeTester and the Maxi-test brand testers offer precise measurements of transconductance/Gm and emissions/iP at full or near full voltages, the Orange tester offers a very simple numerical quality scale. The EasyTubeTester has a unique feature of quick tube matching +/-percentage display. =Filament continuity tester= The simplest tester is the filament continuity tester, usually with a neon lamp connected in series with the filament/heater and a current limiting resistance fed directly by the mains. There is therefore no need to select the appropriate filament voltage for the particular tube under test, but this equipment will not identify tubes that may be faulty in other (more likely) ways, nor indicate any degree of wear. The same checks can be made with a cheap multimeter's resistance test. =Tube checker= The tube checker is the second-simplest of all tube testers after filament continuity testing. Tubes are used as a low power rectifier, with all elements other than filament connections connected together as the anode, at a fraction of its normal emission. By mistake referred to sometimes as Emission Tester because they are a crude measure of emission in directly heated types (but a measure of unwanted heater-cathode leakage in indirectly heated types). Switches will need to select the correct filament voltage and pins. =Emission tester= Next in complexity is the emission tester, which basically treats any tube as a diode by carefully connecting the cathode to ground, all the grids and plate to B+ voltage, feeding the filament with the correct voltage, and an ammeter in series with either the plate or the cathode. This effectively measures emission, the current which the cathode is capable of emitting, for the given plate voltage, which can usually be controlled by a variable load resistor. Switches will need to select the correct filament voltage plus which pins belong to the filament and cathode(s). Older testers may call themselves Plate Conductance if the ammeter is in series with the plate, or Cathode Conductance if the meter is in series with the cathode.Know your Tube and Transistor Testers, Robert G. Middleton The problems of emission testers are: * they do not measure key characteristics of tubes, like transconductance * they do not perform the tests at real load, voltages and currents * they test the tube under static conditions, which are not even near the dynamic conditions the tube would work with in a real electronic device * tubes with grids might not even show the real emission because of hot spots in the cathode, hidden by the grids under normal conditions * grids will be forward biased to some extent - some fine control grid wires are limited in their ability to withstand this * the amount of current that should be considered \\"100%\\" has to be known and documented for each tube type (and will be different for different emission test circuit details) The advantage of an emission tester is that from all types of tube testers, it provides the most reliable warning of tube wear-out. If emission is at 70%, transconductance can be at 90% still, and gain at 100%. The best and most popular version used by the German army was the Funke W19 . The disadvantage of an emission tester is that it can test a good tube as bad, and a bad tube as good, because it ignores other properties of the tube. A tube with low emission will work perfectly fine in most circuits, and need not be replaced on that indication alone, unless it measures much lower than specified or if it indicates a short. A variation on the emission tester is the dynamic conductance tester, a type of tester developed by the Jackson Electrical Company of Dayton, Ohio. The main difference is the use of ‚Äòproportional AC voltages‚Äô in place of applying the current directly to the grids and plate. =Short circuit test= Usually, emission testers also have a short circuit test which is just a variation of the continuity tester with a neon lamp, and which allows to identify if there is any shortcut between the different pairs of electrodes. =Parametric tester= A tester of this type applies DC voltage to the tube being tested, and datasheet values are verified under real conditions. Some parametric testers apply AC voltage to the tube being tested, with verification under conditions which simulate DC operation. Examples include the AVO line of tube testers, along with the Funke W20 and the Neuberger RPG375. =Mutual conductance tester= The mutual conductance tester tests the tube dynamically by applying bias and an AC voltage to the control grid, and measuring the current obtained on the plate, while maintaining the correct DC voltages on the plate and screen grid. This setup measures the transconductance of the tube, indicated in micromhos. =Oscilloscope tube curve tracer plug-in= A full set of characteristic curves for vacuum tubes, and later for semiconductor devices, could be displayed on an oscilloscope screen by use of a plug-in adapter, or on a dedicated curve tracer. An example is the Tektronix 570.Radiomuseum: Electron Tube Curve Tracer 570 Self-service tube testers An RCA self-service tube tester on display at the Oklahoma History Center.From the late 1920s until the early 1970s, many department stores, drug stores and grocery stores in the U.S. had a self-service tube-vending display. It typically consisted of a tube-tester atop a locked cabinet of tubes, with a flip chart of instructions. One would remove the tubes from a malfunctioning device, such as a radio or television, bring them to the store, and test them all, looking up the instructions from the model number on the tube and the flip chart. If a tube was defective, store personnel would sell a replacement from the cabinet. At that time, tubes in consumer devices were installed in sockets and were easily replaceable, except for the CRT in televisions. Devices typically had a removable back with a diagram showing where to replace each tube. There were only a few types of tube socket; a radio or television set would have multiple identical sockets, so it was easy to mistakenly exchange tubes with different functions, but similar bases, between two different sockets. If testing showed all tubes to be working, the next step was a repair shop. As transistorized devices took over the market, the grocery-store tube-tester vanished.

This is a similar species to Trivia monacha and it often occurs in the same areas. The name Trivia means \\"common\\" and the word arctica means \\"of the arctic\\". Distribution This species occurs from the Mediterranean Sea, Orkney north of Scotland and Norway. It is more common in the north. In the British Isles the shells are known as \\"cowries\\", except in Caithness, Orkney and Shetland where they are called Groatie Buckies. In the Isles of Scilly the shell is referred to as a Guinea Money. Habitat This species usually lives below low tide, in other words is sublittoral, but the empty shells of this species are often washed up onto beaches. In its northern range is found at depths of 100 m and in it southern range at depths up to 1000 m. Description The shell is glossy and lemon-shaped, with 20-30 transverse ridges. The upper part of the shell is a uniform very pale brown in color; there are no pigment spots present on the shell, but sometimes there are dots on the mantle of the animal. The shell length is up to a maximum of about 10 mm and a width of about 8 mm. The mantle is covered with many papillae. It has a light colour in deeper waters, but becomes darker between tide marks. The foot is light yellow or light orange. The admedian teeth of the radula have denticles. The penis is flat and broad. The larvae have a light stomach and intestine. In the veliger stage they have a four-lobed velum (a structure used for swimming and particulate food collection) with very long lobes. Life habits This snail lives among and feeds on compound ascidians, including Botryllus schlosseri. They often occur together with Trivia monacha. The breeding season is autumn, winter and early spring. Note on differentiating the species Both Trivia arctica and Trivia monacha were considered to be two forms of the same species until 1925, when A. J. Peile published a paper in the Proceedings of the Malacological Society differentiating the two. It is now known that the larvae of the two species are readily distinguishable. The Linnaean name Trivia europea, now lapsed, referred to the supposed single species. Linnaeus himself mentioned two kinds: Cypraea europea and Cypraea anglica, but these terms were intended as a geographical distinction, and are not accepted as species names today.  Use as ornaments during the Stone age Large amount of trivia shell ornaments consisting of Trivia arctica and Trivia monacha have been excavated in Stone Age burials at T√©viec in northwestern France, dating back to c. 5000‚Äì7000 BC.http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Antlers,+bone+pins+and+flint+blades%3A+the+mesolithic+cemeteries+of...-a018602250 They are some of the earliest European examples of false cowrie shells used in necklaces and ornaments, for the most part associated with male skeletons. While the trivia genus superficially resembles the true ribbed cowries from the tropics, the two species are not closely related. However, these shells are sometimes called cowries in the British Isles, but are more widely known as false cowries.

Origin and use The term \\"Hasta la vista\\" is a Spanish farewell that can be literally translated as \\"Until the (next) sighting\\" and means \\"See you later\\" and \\"Goodbye\\". In 1970, Bob Hope comically delivered the \\"Hasta la vista, baby\\" saying to Raquel Welch in the beginning of their \\"Rocky Racoon\\" tribute on Raquel Welch's special Raquel. This term, with the added word \\"baby\\"‚Äî\\"Hasta la vista, baby\\"‚Äîwas later used in a popular hit song from 1987, \\"Looking for a New Love\\" by Grammy Award winner Jody Watley. It was also used in the 1988 Tone L≈çc single \\"Wild Thing\\". The Terminator franchiseTerminator 2: Judgment Day= \\"Hasta la vista, baby\\" became a famous catchphrase when it was used in the 1991 film Terminator 2: Judgment Day, which was written by James Cameron and William Wisher Jr. The phrase is featured in an exchange between the film's characters John Connor (Edward Furlong) and The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), where the former teaches the latter the use of slang: > John Connor: No, no, no, no. You gotta listen to the way people talk. You > don't say \\"affirmative\\" or some shit like that. You say \\"no problemo\\". And > if someone comes on to you with an attitude, you say \\"eat me\\". And if you > want to shine them on, it's \\"hasta la vista, baby\\". > T-800: Hasta la vista, baby. The Terminator says the phrase again prior to shattering the liquid nitrogen‚Äìfrozen T-1000 with a gunshot, famously interpreting the vocative comma with a protracted pause before the word \\"baby\\". In the European Spanish version of the film, the phrase was dubbed as \\"Sayonara, baby\\" to preserve its humorous nature among Spanish-speaking audiences. However, in the Hispanic American version of the film, the phrase remains untouched. =Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines= The phrase is once again uttered in the 2003 film Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines by John Connor (Nick Stahl) while talking to the T-850 (Schwarzenegger), thinking it's the same Terminator he met years prior. The machine replies that it is a different T-101: > John Connor: Do you even remember me? Sarah Connor? Blowing up Cyberdyne? > \\"Hasta la vista, baby\\"? Ring any bells? > T-850: That was a different T-101. > John Connor: What, do you guys come off an assembly line or something? > T-850: Exactly. > John Connor: Oh man, I'm gonna have to teach you everything all over again. Politics Schwarzenegger has since used the phrase during public speeches as part of his political career. During the 1992 Republican primaries, Pat Buchanan challenged President George H. W. Bush for the nomination. Schwarzenegger joined Bush in New Hampshire and urged voters to send Pat Buchanan a message: \\"Hasta la vista, baby.\\" On October 7, 2003, Schwarzenegger was elected Governor of California in a recall election. The Michigan Daily titled its article \\"Voters bid 'hasta la vista' to Davis\\". On November 17, 2008, Schwarzenegger said in an interview on CNN: \\"There are so many different challenges California has ‚Äî it's the greatest state in the greatest country in the world. Hasta la vista, baby!\\" In 2008, Schwarzenegger met with Chilean president Michelle Bachelet during her state visit to California. Bachelet closed her public speech with the phrase \\"Hasta la vista\\" and imitated Schwarzenegger's accent. Other usage Sign at the Fort Bliss U.S. Army post The phrase was also the title of the Skin album Hasta la Vista, Baby! and part of the title of U2's 1997 live album Hasta la Vista Baby!

He is noted for his wide-ranging religious views and his marriage to an outreach pastor at Christ's Chapel, physicality, and sarcasm. Among other topics, he often focuses on American politics. Once, when asked what he'd do if he were mayor of Madison, Wisconsin, he replied, > I'd do photo ops with Marilyn Manson and underprivileged children while my > contributors continued to dump toxic waste in the rivers of Third World > nations, then go home and do lines off the bare back of my 19-year-old > Malaysian concubine. You know, like a real politician. Throughout his career, his material has also focused on his support of LGBT rights and his criticism of religion.  Early life and career  Randy Chestnut was born in Dallas, Texas, in 1971. His early years were spent moving from state to state, living in Texas, Massachusetts, Maine, Florida, and Wisconsin. Beginning his career in Madison, Wisconsin at the Funny Business Comedy Club ‚Äì later called The Comedy Club On State ‚Äì Chestnut spent nearly two years as an amateur, honing his stagecraft and developing his material. When asked, Chestnut claims his comedy is > imported at great expense from a left-handed cobbler in Sussex, England, who > answers to the name \\"King Cat Crocodile, Hector The Fuel Injector.\\" In reality, he writes his own. By 1999, he won his first and only comedy competition. Although he was voted Funniest Person in Madison (Wisconsin) in 1999, he found the experience distasteful, and avoids competitions to this day. Also in 1999, Chestnut was invited to perform in the first of two Comics Come Home special events sponsored by Charter Communications and Comedy Central, the proceeds of which were to benefit the Chris Farley Foundation. The second invitation came in 2000. Other performers included Bob Saget, Jim Breuer, Victoria Jackson, Tom Arnold, Kevin Farley, John P. Farley, Tim Kazurinsky, and Sue Murphy. Post‚ÄìSeptember 11, 2001‚Äì2008  Chestnut recounts trouble with increasingly hostile responses from American audiences over his criticism and jokes about President George W. Bush and the Bush administration due to a post-9/11 rise in nationalism. Chestnut admits to being antagonistic and inflammatory, and includes stories of altercations with audience members in his act. He persevered, however, and cites eventual popular disenchantment with the Occupation of Iraq as the reason for more positive reactions to later, similar criticism. In May 2004, Chestnut recorded his first CD at The Comedy Club on State, entitled I Was Funny... Now Pay Me, written and performed by himself, and produced by Austin Katt. A series of delays kept the CD from being released, including the suicide of close friend Eric Harnisch. Chestnut canceled shows in order to help lay his friend to rest. He wrote Harnisch's epitaph, > His wit was exceeded only by his intelligence, his intelligence only by his > selflessness, his selflessness only by his kindness, his kindness only by > his extraordinary life, and his life only by those he touched with it. Eventually, delays kept the CD I Was Funny... Now Pay Me from mass release.  Religion, politics, and social commentary  In his act, Chestnut often expresses his contempt for religion in all forms, and is particularly contemptuous of the Catholic Church. Much of his political material is harshly critical of Republican and neoconservative ideas, in addition to promoting largely liberal ideas, despite claiming to be both nonpartisan and equally disdainful of liberals and Democrats. He is also fiercely anti-corporate in his act.

The original building dates from between 1564 and 1588. History The house has been the family seat of the Guise Baronets for nearly 800 years, first granted by John of Burgh, who was part of the court of Henry III with the rent set at \\"One clove of Gillyflower\\" each year. The current house was built between 1564 and 1588 and altered in the 18th and 19th centuries. The Guise Mausoleum in the grounds was built in 1733. The Guise family were non-resident from about 1685 to about 1845, when Sir John Wright Guise took up residence. The house was used as a school from 1778, originally under the Revd. Charles Bishop (died 1788), and later under the Carveth family to about 1830. Its most distinguished pupil was the future surgeon William Lawrence FRS. The house was owned by Sir Anselm Guise, 6th Baronet, from 1921 to 1970. The current owner, another Anselm Guise, inherited the estate from his uncle the 7th Baronet in 2007, with the Baronetcy going to Anselm's father, Sir Christopher James Guise (born 1930). In 2008 and 2011, Elmore Court was the subject of a Channel 4 television programme presented by hotelier Ruth Watson as part of her Country House Rescue series.

He performed world premieres of numerous works, the first two books of the Freeman Etudes (etudes I‚ÄìXVI and XVII‚ÄìXXXII) by American composer John Cage among others. He was also the first European violinist who recorded the complete Violin and Piano Sonatas of Charles Ives (with pianist Cornelius Cardew). He is the author of a teaching and reference book on violin techniques, which was commissioned after he met Pierre Boulez at IRCAM in 1976. In 1979, he joined the faculty of the University of California at San Diego. He is also known for his computer paintings. He began doing these artworks after moving to San Diego, California. Biography J√°nos N√©gyesy was born in Budapest, Hungary on September 13, 1938 and died on December 20, 2013. His father was taken by the Nazis to a concentration camp, from where he never returned. He got his first violin at the age of four, and only six months later he gave his first public concert at his school. According to him, this was the moment when he decided to become a violinist. He later became a student of Ferenc G√°briel at the Liszt Ferenc Academy of Music of Budapest, who introduced him to Tibor Varga, a former student of G√°briel before World War II. After receiving an invitation in 1965, N√©gyesy moved to Detmold and continued his studies with Varga. From 1970 to 1974 he served as concertmaster of the Radio Berlin Orchestra, which was led by Lorin Maazel at the time. In 1976 he was invited by French composer Pierre Boulez to IRCAM for a week of performances. This invitation resulted in a commission for N√©gyesy to write a book on violin techniques. In 1979, while staying in Lisboa he received a phone call at 3 a.m. asking him if he would join the Music Department at UCSD. Later it turned out that this call changed his life: as of 2012, he is an active teacher at UCSD. It was there in San Diego where he met Finnish violinist P√§ivikki Nykter, a former student of his, who became his wife in 1992. During the past decades they made several recordings together, the complete violin duos of B√©la Bart√≥k and compositions dedicated to them, among others. There are several composers who dedicated pieces to N√©gyesy (probably the most notable is One6 by John Cage) including Attila Bozay, Carlos Fari√±as, Vinko Globokar, Georg Hajdu, Roger Reynolds, Robert Wittinger and Isang Yun. He also has notable recordings of pieces of composers like John Cage, Morton Feldman or Kaija Saariaho. Recently he also became regarded as a master of Max Mathews' electronic violin.

Hibbard,All-Flash #5 at Comics.org who first appeared in books starring the Flash. Their names were taken from Wynken, Blynken, and Nod, although their appearance and characterization was a spoof on the Three Stooges. Noddy Moyland was based on Moe Howard, and often gave the other two a Stooges-style smack. Winky Boylan's red curly hair imitated Larry Fine's. Blinky Toylan's eyes were covered with a shock of hair, recalling Shemp Howard. The comic books frequently referred to them as the \\"Three Dimwits\\", or variants like the \\"Three Numbskulls\\", the \\"Three Dopes\\", or the \\"Three Idiots\\".Three Dimwits: Winky, Blinky, and Noddy at Hyperborea.org. History Winky, Blinky and Noddy first appeared in All- Flash #5 (1942), as incompetent small-time criminals working for a crooked stable owner. After the Flash captured the stable owner, the three henchmen decided to move on to more benign pursuits. In the story \\"The Ray That Changed Men's Souls!\\" in issue #6, they invented a ray that changed people's personalities -- an invention that was quickly stolen by a gang and used to commit crimes. By the end of the story, the ray made them forget their own criminal pasts, and when the readers were asked if they wanted the trio to return, they gave an enthusiastic response. The trio wandered from job to job, usually causing trouble, and the Flash would have to get involved. The Three Dimwits appeared in All-Flash until issue #29 (1947). As their popularity grew, they were featured in solo stories in All-American Comics from issue #73 (1946) to #82 (1947). Their appearances in Flash Comics began in issue #46 (October, 1943) and ended in #79 (January, 1947), and they were seen in Comic Cavalcade from issue #4 (Fall, 1943) to #18 (December/January, 1947). Their antics extended outside their stories into fourth-wall breaking meta- commentary. As The Flash Companion explains, \\"The Three Dimwits even tried to sell their account of the latest Flash adventure to Sheldon Mayer in All-Flash #9 only to have Mayer produce a copy of that already-published issue. So they slipped into the All-American offices unannounced in issue #14 and replaced the scheduled story with one of their own -- forcing a frantic Mayer to stamp an \\"April Fool's Day\\" label on the splash page rather than miss the publication deadline.\\" Revivals Thirteen years later, in 1960, editor Julius Schwartz asked Gardner Fox to write another Dimwits story at the request of fan (and later Marvel Comics editor-in-chief) Roy Thomas. The story appeared in Flash #117, in the story \\"The Madcap Inventors of Central City\\". Despite the promise that they would appear again on a regular basis, negative reader reaction decided otherwise. In Flash vol. 2, #161 (2000), the trio appeared in a flashback that explained why they had disappeared: they had stumbled across a sack full of money and retired to the Caribbean. In Justice League: Cry for Justice #2 (2009), while volunteering as night guards at Flash Museum, they were killed by an unknown assailant who steals the Cosmic Treadmill. Jay investigates the trio's demise.

Plot Woody Woodpecker, hot, hungry and thirsty, is walking across a dry, bleak Western desert and suddenly sees a large tree stump in the distance. He hastens to the tree, climbs on a broken stump, and begins pecking away. He bends his beak as he discovers that it's petrified. Woody hears a horse galloping in the distance. Suddenly, a bandit arrives, dismounts and sends the horse on his way, and then climbs into a huge hole in the tree stump. A posse goes by at full gallop in pursuit of a horse. Woody tries to pay his respects to the bandit, who's captured and sent to prison, vowing vengeance on Woody. The bandit escapes from prison, and he goes to find Woody. From then on, in a series of amusing incidents, they battle it out to see who's the better of the two. Finally, the bandit, in an effort to get away from Woody, takes refuge in an old Western barroom, and he blocks the door with boxes, barrels, etc. He turns toward the bar and sees three Woody Woodpecker heads peeking over the edge. It's Woody, holding two dummy heads. The bandit rushes to the train and returns to the prison. He knocks on the door and demands that he be admitted. The door's opened by Woody, who asks for the password. The surprised bandit yells, \\"A ghost!\\" Woody says, \\"That's the password,\\" and he opens the door. In goes the bandit.

Oxidized iron deposits in the rocks give the canyon its name. Red Canyon Creek drains the canyon and feeds into the Little Popo Agie River at the northern end. The streams provide habitat for wildlife in an otherwise arid region. There is evidence of over 10,000 years of human presence in the canyon, including the Shoshone and Washakie tribes which used it as a transportation corridor between South Pass and the Wind River Basin. White settlers arrived during the 1870s and established farms on the floor of the canyon which provided fresh fruit and grains for nearby miners at South Pass City and Atlantic City.

The three Marisat satellites, F1, F2, and F3, were built by Hughes Aircraft Corporation (HAC) for COMSAT Corporation starting in 1973. The satellites were designed to provide maritime telecommunications services in three large ocean areas, the Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, and the Indian Ocean, and were located at 72.5¬∞ East longitude, 176.5¬∞ E, and 345¬∞ E in the geosynchronous orbital arc. The three-satellite Marisat system served as the initial INMARSAT constellation. Ownership of the three Marisat satellites was transferred to Lockheed Martin when it bought COMSAT Corp in 2000. The Marisat-F2 satellite was acquired by INTELSAT as part of the COMSAT General Corp. acquisition in October 2004. The three satellites were all launched in 1976. MARISAT F1 was launched on 19 February 1976, MARISAT F2 was launched on 10 June 1976, and Marisat F3 was launched at 22:44 GMT, 14 October 1976. Launch vehicle for the satellites was the McDonnell Douglas 2914 Delta rocket. The satellites were launched from Cape Canaveral by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration under contract with COMSAT. In 1981 the INMARSAT took over from the Marisat system. Design The satellites were designed to be identical, with three communications payloads on board; an ultrahigh frequency UHF (240 to 400 MHz) payload for the U.S. Navy, L-band (1.5 to 1.6 GHz) for ship communications via voice, telex, facsimile and high speed data, and C band (6/4 GHz) for communications to fixed shore stations. The Marisat satellites were a cylindrical spinning satellite design similar to earlier satellites like Syncom 1, Intelsat I and II, relying on the gyroscopic forces generated by rotating at approximately 30 rpm to provide stability in the Earth's gravitational field. They were originally designed to last 5 years, but survived much longer, with Marisat F2 operating successfully for 32 years. The cylindrical design of satellites is good for several reasons: #early satellites did not have high power computers and attitude control systems of more modern satellites, and the spinning design provides a good basic method for maintaining a known attitude in orbit about the earth, #the cylindrical design maximized the size of the satellite which could fit inside the nose cone (fairing) of the launch vehicle (rocket), and #the cylindrical design was a simpler design for a spacecraft which would have a rotating body with a de-spun payload module to allow the antenna to point continuously at the same target on the earth (see Nadir pointing). The Marisat satellites weighed about 1450 pounds (660 kilograms). Each satellite is 12 feet 6 inches (3.81 meters) in height and 7 feet 1 inch (2.15 meters) in diameter. =Payload= The UHF payload provided one 500 kHz wide-band channel and two 25 kHz narrow-band channels. The UHF payload on Marisat was designed as a \\"gapfiller\\" to support the U.S. Navy. The U.S. Navy experienced a complete failure of TacSat-1 over the Pacific Ocean in December 1972. UHF channels on Lincoln Labs Experimental Satellite LES-6 were also being used over the Atlantic Ocean, but this satellite was expected to have an end-of-life (EOL) of September 1973. This left the U.S. Navy with a potential \\"gap\\" in UHF coverage for several years until the first FLTSATCOM satellite would be available in December 1978. The U.S. Navy contracted with COMSAT in 1973 for UHF capability over the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean regions (AOR and POR), and later extended the contract for coverage of the Indian Ocean region (IOR). =Solar array= Because of the spinning design of the satellite, the exterior of the cylinder body of the satellite was covered with solar cells, forming a solar power generating array. As the satellite spun in orbit, some part of the array would always be lit by the sun and provide power to the satellite power bus. On Marisat the cylindrical solar panel, covered with approximately 7000 solar cells, supplies each satellite with primary power of 330 watts. Service Marisat F1 (NSSDC ID: 1976-017A) was operated at 345¬∞ E (15¬∞ W) from 1976 to 1990. It was relocated to 254¬∞ E (106¬∞ W) over the Americas until 1997, when it was retired from active service and moved out to a disposal orbit. Marisat F3 (NSSDC ID: 1976-101A) was operated at 72.5¬∞ E until it was retired in the late 1990s and moved out to a disposal orbit. Marisat F2 (NSSCDC ID: 1976-053A) was operated at 176¬∞ E from 1976 to 1991. It was relocated to 182 E (178¬∞ W) and operated there until 1996. It was relocated to 326.1 E (33.9¬∫ W), over the Atlantic Ocean, and since 1999 F2 had been providing a wide-band data link for the National Science Foundation's U.S. Antarctic Program's Amundsen-Scott research station at the South Pole. On Wednesday 29 October 2008, after 32 years of service, the longest for any commercial satellite to date, it was retired from active service. Engineers at INTELSAT used the remaining on-board fuel to raise the orbit of F2 approximately 125 miles (200 km) above the geostationary arc and place it in a disposal orbit.

Synopsis After a short history of television, the high towers of a TV station transmit waves. Woody turns on his TV set to watch his favorite quiz show, ‚ÄúWin the Whole Wide World.‚Äù He waits for a question, the prize for which is ‚ÄúThe Whole Wide World.‚Äù But the program keeps being interrupted by endless annoying (yet amusing) commercials promoting such products as hair restorer (Hair Goop Hair Oil with Chicken fat) which turns a bald man into a hairy gorilla, small cars, cigarette products for the thinking man, toothpaste (Polka-Dot Toothpaste), curlers, Scat-Fat tablets which reduce an obese man until he's as thin as a sheet of paper, and sleep-inducers (Cork-Off, the drugless sleep-inducer). Finally, the question is broadcast: ‚ÄúWho is buried in Grant‚Äôs Tomb?‚Äù Woody rushes to the station with his answer, Napoleon, only to discover it is incorrect (George Washington is the correct answer). Although it's wrong, he earns a consolation prize: he'll be sent south for the winter, all expenses paid. Woody ends up on the South Pole, only to watch more TV, freezing, inside an igloo. When the announcer says, ‚ÄúFirst a word from our sponsor,‚Äù Woody shoots his TV set and stops the show.

Bohai Bay is located to the south and connects with Ninghe County in the north. The Jiyun River divides the north and south of the district for a length of and covers a watershed of . It covers an area of , including of city zones. Its current bottomland is , while the surface area is . The river vents 720 million m3 of water to the sea annually. The district has two reservoirs, the capacity of Yingcheng reservoir is 30 million m3, while that of Gaozhuang reservoir is 4.5 million m3. Economy Hangu has a dualistic economic structure of a large city and small country. The northwest of the district is the agricultural area, while its southeast is the industrial area as well as ocean fishery area. The city zone is centrally located, on both sides of Jiyun River. Industry Hangu District has a stable foundation in its industries. Much of the districts industry is based in the Binhai area. Marine chemical production forms the largest part of the areas industry, followed by other synthetic production industries. Its industrial output amounts to 80% of the national income. There are 13 kinds of primary industries like salt, chemical, textile, clothing, mechanism, metallurgy processing, paper making, home appliances, furniture, electronics, architectural materials, foods and shoemaking. The Changlu Hangu saltfield is one of the four saltfields of the famous Changlu salt area, which has a strong capacity in crude salt production. It also produces a series of high-quality products in the fields of fine salt and chemical, most of which are exported. Agriculture and fisheries make up the rest of Hangu's economy. Rice, fruits, aquatic products are the prominent features of the agricultural products in Hangu. The area's grapes contain high amounts of sugar and are used for wine production. Marine Industry The district boasts plentiful marine chemical resources. The area's coast line spans 32 kilometers, contains 27 species of seawater and freshwater fish and its history of salt processing dates back over 1000 years. Hangu's salt ponds cover an area of , about three times the size of the plantation area in the whole district. Its 'Changlu salt' is world-renowned and is white in color and large in size. It has owned the reputation of \\"Jade in Lutai\\" from the old. As the average content of sodium chloride is 96.8%, it is a perfect raw material for use in marine chemicals. Power supply Much of the areas electric power is generated from Solar energy, while there is also widespread use of oil resources and geothermal power, which has been heavily exploited. Other methods of power supply are being considered for future development, such as wave power and wind power. Land usage There are two parts of uncultivated land in Hangu, the total area of which is . One is in the southeast part containing the Jiyun river and is near the coast to the east and has the Tanggu highway and Beijing - Shanhaiguan railway. Meanwhile, this land has Yingcheng reservoir and processing establishments for industrial sewage in the south and public city infrastructures in the north. The northeastern part of Hangu is also undeveloped with Hannan railway running through it. Transport The area is linked to the Jingshan and Beijing-Shanhaiguan railways. The Hannan line also leads to the Nanbao saltfield in Hebei Province and the regional industrial shuttle line have been established in Hangu. Four railway stations serve the district with an annual output exceeding 5 million tons. Hangu is well connected to China's road network with 7 routes leading towards the area, including the Lu-Han, Tang-Han, Jin-Han, Han-Yu, Hannan, Hanbei and Lutang roads which connect Hangu with TEDA, Tianjin New Port, Beijing, Tangshan and northeast China.

Career Ernesto Perez-Carrillo, the legendary architect behind the famous blockbuster brand La Gloria Cubana, is once again captivating the cigar world under his own name, E.P. Carrillo. As a young adult, Ernesto‚Äôs passion was for jazz, not cigars. He always dreamed of becoming a successful jazz drummer and, at the age of 25, he moved to New York City to pursue a career as a musician. After exhausting his efforts to catch on with the famed Stan Getz and his band, he finally returned to Miami, and began his journey to becoming a legendary master blender. In 1976, Ernesto discovered his true calling in life and spent the next four years shadowing his father and learning how a master created a cigar. In his path to becoming an established name in the cigar industry, Ernesto took over the reins of El Credito, his father‚Äôs cigar company, and set out to create a cigar that would ignite the senses and create a full-sensory experience for cigar lovers. When he finally put the perfect blend together, under his sole craftsmanship, La Gloria Cubana was re-created. The La Gloria Cubana instantly became a hit in the cigar craze of the early 90‚Äôs and, in 1999, Swedish Match purchased El Credito from the Perez-Carrillo family. After working for Swedish Match/General Cigar until March 2009, Ernesto‚Äôs children proposed for him to return to the tobacco fields and craft the next great cigar. With the start of E.P. Carrillo, Ernesto had once again dedicated himself to perfecting a family-run, boutique cigar brand alongside his daughter, Lissette Perez- Carrillo, and son, Ernesto Perez-Carrillo III. After dedicating over 50 years to his craft, Ernesto continues to develop top-rated, masterful blends under the E.P. Carrillo name at the family‚Äôs factory, La Tabacalera Alianza, in the Dominican Republic. In 2014 Ernesto blended the La Historia EIII, the #2 Cigar of the Year ranked by Cigar Aficionado magazine. https://www.cigaraficionado.com/top25cigar/e-p-carrillo-la-historia-e-iii-2014 Then in 2018 the Carrillo cigar, Encore Majestic received the highest honor as #1 Cigar of the Year from Cigar Aficionado. https://www.cigaraficionado.com/top25cigar/e-p-carrillo-encore-majestic-2018 External links *E.P.

According to the Finnish government, \\"the Helsinki Process searches for novel and empowering solutions to the dilemmas of global governance. It aims to offer a forum for open and inclusive dialogue between major stakeholders\\".Second Phase of the Process. Helsinki Process. Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland. 15 December 2008. http://www.helsinkiprocess.fi/About/  Background  The Helsinki Process is a Finnish government foreign initiative. While some countries are focused internally on how their policies can contribute to just globalisation, Finland is more oriented towards external initiatives, such as during the Cold War when Finland helped facilitate the East-West negotiations. The Helsinki Process is an attempt by Finland to encourage North-South engagement.Deacon, p. 182. Through its partnership with Tanzania, Finland launched a platform where countries from the North and South can work together to mitigate the adverse impact of globalisation and manage the process equitably. This initiative serves as a forum for governments from the North and South, international organizations, private sector, civil society, and other stakeholders. By 2005, the Helsinki Process hosted a two-day conference that attracted 700 participants from 79 countries. Phases The Helsinki Process has two phases. The first phase of the process occurred from 2003 to September 2005.

Breve et facile maniera d'essercitarsi ad ogni scolaro. NY: Broude Bros., 1978 still in use today. Biography Conforti, also spelled Conforto, was born in Mileto, Calabria, around 1560. He sang in the Papal chapel from 1580 to October 31, 1585. He and several of his colleagues were expelled for joining the Congregazione dei Musici di Roma, membership of which was forbidden to papal singers, though he was later allowed to rejoin. In 1586, he was reportedly serving the Duke of Sessa when Cardinal Scipione Gonzaga and protonotary Camillo Capilupi recommended him for service at the court of Mantua, and in the letters they provide descriptions of Conforti's voice and style. When Capilupi heard him sing Lenten music at Santa Trinit√†, he proclaimed him the best falsettist in Rome, praising Conforti's resonance, improvization, and ornamentation. Cardinal Gonzaga's letters say Conforti sang both contralto and soprano skillfully, the first with a full voice, and the latter with a sweet tone. His skill came to impress many, and he was considered a prominent virtuoso soloist.Jackson, Roland. \\"Marenzio, Poland and the Late Polychoral Sacred Style.\\" Early Music. 27, No. 4 (Nov. 1999): 622-631. That same year, Conforti is known to have sung at the Santissima Trinit√† dei Pellegrini, a place all well-known musicians of the time performed. In 1595, he performed in a Lenten ceremony at the Arciconfraternita del Santissima Crocefisso under the direction of Luca Marenzio, a prominent Roman composer.O'Regan, Noel. \\"Marenzio's Sacred Music.\\" Early Music. 27, No. 4 (Nov. 1999): 609-620. Conforti ended up not going to Mantua due to bureaucratic lagtime, but went to serve at S Luigi dei Francesi under Ruggiero Giovanelli in Tivoli. He was there from June 1, 1587 to April 30, 1588. In 1591, he again served the Papal chapel, serving there, in Rome, until his death in 1608. WorksBrief and Easy Manner of Exercising for Every Student= Conforti's Breve et facile maniera d'essercitarsi ad ogni scolaro is one of only a few books on vocal embellishment written at the end of the sixteenth century.Neumann, Frederick. Ornamentation In Baroque and Post- Baroque Music. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1978 It is also specifically addressed to instrumentalists (\\"\\"), and thus forms part of the substantial 16th-century Italian literature of diminution and ornamentation which begins with the Fontegara of Silvestro Ganassi in 1535 and includes the treatises of Diego Ortiz, Giovanni Maffei, Girolamo Dalla Casa, Giovanni Bassano, Riccardo Rogniono, Giovanni Battista Bovicelli and Aurelio Virgiliano. There are three original copies known to exist, two in the British Library and one in the Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale Giovanni Battista Martini in Bologna. All have the same nearly unreadable publication date, usually read as 1593, though there is no external evidence to support this or any other date. The book was written for students to quickly and easily learn the art of ornamentation. According to Conforti, this goal could be achieved in a few months by following his method. The treatise is user-friendly in its layout. Each section deals with an ascending or descending interval, showing passages in various rhythmic patterns that get progressively more difficult. The 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, octave and unison are addressed. Also included are more elaborate passages, a table of conventional ornaments, and examples of embellished cadences. A conclusion is included, which explains the examples. In his conclusion, \\"Declaration about the passages to the readers,\\" Conforti states that his method is meant to help to embellish the singing of those who do not come by it naturally. He recommends learning and memorizing each section in nine days, learning all the exercises in less than two months. Upon completing the exercises, singers are meant to be able to add his embellishments into their sung lines, as well as improvise their own embellishments. Conforti also confides that his exercises are not exhaustive, and he only included those he judged to be the most appealing, leaving out others in order to create less confusion on the page. He emphasizes the importance of following one's ear when embellishing and understanding which notes will create a consonance. The manual was written for the benefit of singers, but Conforti also encourages its use by instrumentalists as finger exercises, suggested ornaments, and a method for learning to improvise ornaments on one's own. =Other works= In addition to the Breve e facile maniera, he also wrote three-volumes of settings of the Vesper psalm and Magnificat for three voices and basso continuo. He applies his own system of embellishment, as laid out in the Breve e facile maniera, in his three volumes of Salmi passaggiati. In addition to his own works, Conforti collected and compiled others. He collected Paolo Quagliati's two volumes of three-voice Canzonette (Rome, 1588) for publication and wrote the dedications. The second of these contains Conforti's own Amara vita √® quella de gl'amanti. He compiled the Psalmi, motecta, Magnificat, et antiphona Salve Regina diversorum auctorum, published in 1592.

It is native to large river channels and major side branches in the Amazon Basin, and is common in the Tef√© River and the Rio Solim√µes to a depth of . It is found in both whitewater and blackwater habitats. The species name preto comes from the Portuguese word for \\"black\\", referring to its coloration. As its scientific name suggests, S. preto is distinguished from all other Sternarchogiton species by its entirely dark brown to purplish black color. The fins have hyaline rays and dark brown membranes. The body is a laterally compressed and knife-shaped, with a nearly straight dorsal profile. The head is laterally compressed with a convex dorsal profile and small eyes that are covered by a membrane. Unlike other Sternarchogiton species it has long, conical teeth (numbering 5 plus 2-3 replacements) on the premaxillary of the upper jaw; there is one row of teeth (numbering 10 plus 3 replacements) on the dentary bone of the lower jaw. Both upper and lower pharyngeal tooth plates are present, bearing 6 and 4-5 teeth respectively. The long anal fin contains 189-210 soft rays. The pectoral fins are broad and pointed, with 12-14 rays. The tail is frequently missing or regenerated; when intact it is compressed and short, with a small lanceolate caudal fin containing 13-20 rays. The origin of the whip-like dorsal electroreceptive appendage is in the latter half of the body. There are 5-8 rows of scales above the lateral line. There is no sexual dimorphism in morphology or pigmentation. S. preto grows to about long. As in other apteronotids, S. preto generates a continuous, weak electric field for electrolocation and communication. This electric organ discharge (EOD) has a fundamental frequency of 1266‚Äì1922 Hz and 2 phases. There is no obvious sexual dimorphism in frequency or waveform. Reproduction is believed to occur early in the rising water period, with individuals in breeding condition in October. Juveniles have been caught in floating meadows alongside the Tef√© River throughout the flooding season (December to April).

It is generally written in a simple, unadorned Latin by an author who reveals no knowledge of a wide reading; his only reference to other literature is a Biblical reminiscence in chapter 28.So unadorned--\\"bleak\\" in the words of Fletcher, 94--is the Historia that only one figure of speech (a simile, \\"still as a stone\\") is ever used, twice. Modern editors have divided the work into seventy-seven chapters (not in the original). The author apparently knew little of Rodrigo's life before his marriage to Jimena, and the whole of it is narrated in the first six chapters. The details of Rodrigo's career leading up to and including his exile in Zaragoza (1081-86) are related with more confidence (chapters 7-24). The period of Rodrigo's return to the court of Alfonso VI of Le√≥n and to Castile (1086-88) are passed over quickly (chapters 25-27), as are the years 1095-96, during which Rodrigo ruled Valencia. The largest portion of the history (chapters 28-64) is devoted to his second exile and conquest of Valencia (1089-95). The final section (chapters 65-75) covers the last two years of Rodrigo's life and a brief epilogue (chapters 76-77) describes the Christian evacuation of Valencia in 1102 under the direction of Jimena. The coverage is by no means even, as the author admits in chapter 27: \\"Not all the wars and warlike exploits which Rodrigo accomplished with his knights and companions are written in this book.\\"Fletcher, 94. The earliest preserved manuscript of the work dates to the first half of the thirteenth century. It was found in the late eighteenth century in San Isidoro in Le√≥n, but was probably originally copied in Castile or La Rioja. It is now MS 9/4922 in the library of the Real Academia de la Historia in Madrid. This manuscript contains many examples of early Spanish historiography: Isidore of Seville's Historia Gothorum, Julian of Toledo's Historia Wambae, the Chronicle of Alfonso III, the Chronica Naierensis, and royal genealogies.Fletcher, 95. Several errors in the Historia Roderici indicate that this manuscript is a copy. Possibly it is the copy mentioned in a document of 1239 as being copied at the in Carri√≥n de los Condes in 1232/3 from an exemplar of the monastery of N√°jera, but this cannot be proved. R. A. Fletcher tentatively dates the Historia to before 1125. In chapter 23, the scribe of the Madrid manuscript put \\"S√∫nchez\\" for the correct patronymic \\"S√°nchez\\", an orthographic error that may originate in a misreading of Visigothic script.The text reads Ennecus Suggiz de Montecluso, a reference to √ç√±igo S√°nchez de Moncl√∫s, whom the Cid captured at the Battle of Morella (1084). The spelling Suggiz is phonetic (with the exception of the u). The script, once common all over Spain, was disappearing in central Spain by 1125 and was all but extinct there by the 1140s, replaced by the script called francesa and adopted from France. Since the Visigothic 'a' had an open top, it resembled the French 'u'. The copyist was probably working from a Visigothic original (or faithful copy).Fletcher, 95-96. References *Barton, Simon. 1997.

The Palm Walk is a pedestrian mall located on Arizona State University's Tempe campus that is lined with one hundred and five Mexican fan palms. Running from the foot of the University bridge to the north, to the Student Recreation Complex to the south, the path runs for almost four-tenths of a mile. The path itself follows the old alignment of Normal Avenue, before it was incorporated into the expanding college's campus. HistoryOrigins= The history of the palm walk dates to an early attempt at campus beautification by Tempe Normal School President Arthur John Matthews. While popularly cited as being planted in 1916, there is no definitive date on when the trees were planted. The best estimates for when the trees were planted vary from 1916 to 1919, although there also exist orders for trees in 1917 and 1918, the latter of which mentions the purchase of palm trees. Originally planted on the northern end of the walk near the original Normal School campus, the trees were later planted to the south, as the college expanded. The last trees were planted in 1930 or the 1930s, depending on sources, and are smaller than the trees on northern portions of the route. As the Palm Walk runs along the former alignment of Normal Avenue to what would have been the eastern edge of the main campus as it was built, it marked the eastern boundary for campus. As the college expanded over the years, it has become a local landmark for the university. The University Archives maintains a Web site that displays photos of Palm Walk from the 1930s, 1946, 1957, 1966, and the 1990s. =Online photo controversy= In the fall of 2005, a Hot or Not-style rating site, PalmWalk.com, featured pictures of female students photographed on the campus walkway and asked users to rate their appearance. The site drew the ire of students due to the nature of the work, as pictures were taken of women without their knowledge or consent. While the website's owners hid their identity through the nature of the web domain, they also stated that they respected the rights of the individuals posted, and would remove any photographs upon request. Student feedback was quite negative of the site, with The State Press stating that it was not reflective of the university's culture of being known for having attractive women. The site also garnered attention from university officials and police, due to issues with potential copyright violations since the photos were posted without the consent of the university. However, as the website poster was taking the photos in public, there was no violation of privacy since there is no expectation of privacy in a public location. A counter website, Palmshock.com, was eventually formed, which allowed for people to vent their frustrations over the site. =Tree replacement= Since 2013, Arizona State University has published articles stating that the palms of Palm Walk are at the end of their lifespan.https://asunow.asu.edu/content/trees-lining-iconic- palm-walk-turn-100-years- oldhttp://www.statepress.com/article/2013/02/university-prepares-for-new- trees-on-palm-walkhttp://www.statepress.com/article/2016/04/palm-walk- history-100-year-anniversary-asu-palm-walk According to the university, Mexican fan palms have an estimated lifetime of 100-110 years old, although scientific research has shown that the trees could live as much as five hundred years. As such, the university has drawn up plans to replace the palms with Date palms of an unknown cultivar, in the coming years. These trees would not only provide more shade than the current trees, but they would also allow for harvestable dates, which could then be sold locally. While there is no timeline on replacement of current palms, it is expected that it would be done in the coming decade. Name Originally, there was no official name for the Palm Walk, as a 1926 catalog for the school called it College Palms. By 1932, the name was simplified and called The Palms, and the earliest known use of the current name was from a 1967 pamphlet that used palm walk.

Due to their association with the national Australian competition, they have drawn a large amount of controversy and media attention. Formation of VFL (1896) The VFL was formed in 1896 when Carlton, Collingwood, Essendon, Fitzroy, Geelong, Melbourne, South Melbourne and St Kilda left the Victorian Football Association. A number of other VFA clubs were touted as becoming members of the League at this time, the most notable being North Melbourne and Port Melbourne. =North Melbourne= North was denied entry due to Essendon believing that it would take its recruiting areas.History of North Melbourne FC =Port Melbourne= Port Melbourne was denied entry in favour of South due to its reputation of having unruly fans.http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/SportingTraditions/1986/st0301/st0301d.pdf North Melbourne eventually gained admission in 1925, and Port Melbourne continued to play in the VFA. VFL expansion (1925) Between 1919 and 1925 the VFL sought expressions of interest from clubs wishing to gain admittance to the League. While Footscray, Hawthorn and North Melbourne were accepted in 1925, a number of existing VFA clubs were considered. The VFA clubs were Brighton, Brunswick, Port Melbourne and Prahran.http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/SportingTraditions/1986/st0202/st0202h.pdf One impediment that the VFL encountered when considering admitting existing VFA clubs to its ranks in 1925 was the existing recruiting districts; the VFL clubs' districts had been drawn up equitably in 1915, and clubs were unwilling to surrender portions of their districts to incoming VFA clubs. One attempt to overcome this was the Public Service Football Club, which would draw its players from the public service rather than from a geographical district. The Public Service club was formally established in 1924 and was based at the newly built Motordrome, and it applied to join the VFL in 1925; but its application was rejected and the club disbanded without playing a game. =North Melbourne (1907, 1921)= After the split between the VFL and VFA, North Melbourne became one of the stronger clubs in the VFA. In 1908, after University was admitted to the league, North Melbourne merged with West Melbourne and applied to become the tenth team in the league, under the name City Football Club; but, proposal was rejected and Richmond was admitted instead. North Melbourne and West Melbourne were kicked out of the VFA for attempting to defect, but North Melbourne returned to the VFA the same year under a new committee. In another attempt to gain admission, North Melbourne proposed a merger with Essendon in 1921, when Essendon attempted to move to the Arden Street Oval after its home ground at East Melbourne was closed. The proposal was rejected and both clubs continued in their previous states. North Melbourne finally gained admission to the VFL in 1925. =Footscray (1919, 1922, 1923)= In the decade following World War I, Footscray became a powerhouse of the VFA. It was a rich club in a strong industrial area, and was able to recruit players aggressively from the VFL. It first applied for membership of the VFL in 1919, and then again in 1922 and 1923. It was admitted in 1925.http://www.westernbulldogs.com.au/potted%20history/tabid/4190/default.aspx VFL expansion proposals In the mid-1950s there were additional discussions and an attempt by a club to gain admission into the VFL. =Ballarat (1955)= In 1954 there was discussion within the VFL to expand the competition to include both Ballarat and Bendigo sides.https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/248339694 In 1955 the Ballarat Football Club officially applied to join the VFL. Although the application was referred to a special sub-committee that was to meet and make a recommendation, there is no evidence that the application was ever acted on by the VFL.https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/71667524 Fitzroy mergers (1980, 1986, 1989, 1994, 1996) The Fitzroy Football Club, while being a league powerhouse in the early 1900s, found itself in financial difficulties by the 1980s. A number of mergers and relocations were proposed by both the league and the club throughout the 1980s and 1990s, culminating in the club merging its playing operations with the Brisbane Bears in 1996. National Competition proposals (since 1980) While between 1925 and 1986 the same twelve clubs competed in the VFL, with the only exceptions being in 1942 and 1943 when Geelong went into recess due to travel restrictions, petrol rationing and loss of players to service in World War II, and in 1982 when the financially troubled South Melbourne relocated to Sydney, there were a number of developments in the 1980s when new clubs were proposed as the League became the pre-eminent competition in the country. =East Perth (1980)= In 1980 East Perth of the West Australian Football League applied to join the VFL as the League's first non-Victorian club. Nothing came of this application.http://www.amnet.net.au/~daveiza/royals/vfl.html =Los Angeles Crocodiles (1980's)= In 1980's Los Angeles Crocodiles applied to join the VFL as the League's first non-Australian club.

In 1982 the Norwood Football Club had sought discussions with the VFL about admissions but these met with cold responses. When Port Adelaide were privately seeking admission into the AFL during 1990, the AFL approached the club but Norwood decided to follow the SANFL's decision with its intentions undecided at the time.1990 'IN BRIEF ACT orienteers win top places.', The Canberra Times (ACT : 1926 - 1995), 9 August, p. 16, viewed 28 June 2014, http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article122303309 =Fremantle Sharks (1987)= In 1987, the first year after the admission of the West Coast Eagles to the VFL, traditional rival WAFL clubs East Fremantle and South Fremantle had discussions on the possibility of merging and joining the VFL as a second Perth-based team. The merged club was to have been known as the Fremantle Sharks, and to have played at South Fremantle Oval. =Port Adelaide (1990)= Seven years before its debut season in the AFL, the then SANFL club Port Adelaide applied to become the AFL's first South Australian club. During the 1990 preseason Port Adelaide played a practice match against the Geelong Cats at Football Park in front of 35,000.1990 'Trio to miss Cats' final hit-out.', The Canberra Times (ACT : 1926 - 1995), 21 March, p. 44, viewed 28 June 2014, http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article120886781 However the bid met with legal issues within South Australia resulting in the SANFL creating the Adelaide Crows.http://www.theroar.com.au/2010/03/02/the-drama-of- port-adelaides-1990-bid-to-join-afl/ =Australian Capital Territory (1990)= The Australian Capital Territory Australian Football League expressed an interest in fielding a team in the VFL/AFL through the late 1980s, in large part to try to improve the profile of the sport in the ACT, since Australian rules football had lost ground to rugby league and basketball since the Canberra Raiders and Canberra Cannons had begun competing at the top level of those two sports. In 1990, the ACTAFL began to arrange a deal with the AFL to field a Canberra-based team in the AFL Reserves competition from 1991, which the ACTAFL hoped would later lead to senior representation. The ACTAFL had received assurances from the AFL throughout 1990 that the bid was progressing well; but progress abruptly stalled and the bid failed in August 1990 when Port Adelaide made its bid to join the AFL, drawing almost all of the AFL's strategic focus to the South Australian situation. =Norwood-Sturt (1990's)= A rival bid proposed by Norwood and financially struggling Sturt to combat Port Adelaide's second bid was seriously considered during the early 1990s. When Port Adelaide won the second licence the Norwood-Sturt merger was still discussed but relations between the clubs quickly soured.Devaney, John \\"The Full Points Footy Encyclopedia of Australian Football Clubs, Volume 1\\", pg. 365 = Norwood Crows (1995) = During 1995 the Norwood Football Club, with the assistance of Wolf Blass, attempted to buy the Adelaide Crows and have them relocated to the Parade. =Southport Sharks (1996)= By 1995 the Southport Sharks had reached 20,000 members began to lead the charge for a second Queensland team entering the Australian Football League. In 1996, the Sharks made their first bid to the AFL for inclusion in the national league, which was rejected by the AFL in favour of the Port Adelaide Football Club's elevation from the SANFL. After which, the club continued to lobby for a licence.

Out of all the proposed merger combinations in the 1990s, it was seemed as ideal as it was known that Hawthorn had a football team which ranked as one of the best of all time but were in a dire financial situation, as opposed to Melbourne which had a sound financial base but were a club which had mostly struggled on-field since their last premiership in 1964. Despite the controversial approval of the Melbourne Football Club board and members, the merger was voted out by Hawthorn members after a passionate campaign led by Don Scott. =Tasmania (mid-1990s, 2008)= Tasmania is traditionally a strong Australian Football state, and as such has been touted as being a location for an AFL club.

The classification of Champagne vineyards developed in the mid-20th century as a means of setting the price of grapes grown through the villages of the Champagne wine region. Unlike the classification of Bordeaux wine estates or Burgundy Grand cru vineyards, the classification of Champagne is broken down based on what village the vineyards are located in.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 152-153 Oxford University Press 2006 A percentile system known as the √âchelle des Crus (\\"ladder of growth\\") acts as a pro-rata system for determining grape prices. Vineyards located in villages with high rates will receive higher prices for their grapes than vineyards located in villages with a lower rating. While the √âchelle des Crus system was originally conceived as a 1-100 point scale, in practice, the lowest rated villages are rated at 80%. Premier crus villages are rated between 90 and 99 percent while the highest rated villages, with 100% ratings are Grand crus.T. Stevenson, ed. The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia (4th Edition) pg 172-174 Dorling Kindersley 2005 Origins Prior to the development of the √âchelle des Crus systems, the Champagne industry functioned on a business dynamic that heavily favored the Champagne houses over the vine growers. Since making sparkling wine is a costly and time-consuming endeavor, most vine growers did not have the means or finances to produce Champagne themselves. So instead they would sell their grapes to the Champagne houses who would produce the wines. In a means to generate greater profit, some Champagne houses would look outside the Champagne region for grapes. The development of the French national railroad system in the mid 19th century opened up easy access to cheaper grapes from the Loire Valley and the Languedoc. The Champenois vine growers were incensed at these practices, believing that using \\"foreign\\" grapes to make sparkling was not producing true Champagne. They petitioned the government for assistance and a law was passed requiring that at least 51% of the grapes used to make Champagne needed to come from the Champagne region itself.D. and P. Kladstrup \\"Champagne: How the World's Most Glamorous Wine Triumphed Over War and Hard Times\\" (New York: William Morrow, 2005), p. 130-136 . With vineyard owners vastly outnumbering the producers, the Champagne houses used this dynamic of excess supply vs limited demand to their advantage. They hired agents, known as commissionaires, to negotiate prices with vine growers. These commissionaires were paid according to how low a price they could negotiate and many employed unsavory tactics to achieve their means-including violence and intimidation. Some commissionaires openly sought bribes from vine growers, often in the form of extra grapes which they would sell themselves for extra profit. The prices they were able to negotiate barely covered the cost of farming and harvesting which left many Champenois vine growers in poverty. With the constant threat of Champagne houses ignoring the law and using more \\"foreign\\" grapes, tensions were already high between vine growers and Champagne houses when the late 19th century and early 20th century brought with it the devastation of the phylloxera epidemic and a string of poor weather and poor vintages. The tensions culminated in the Champagne riots of 1910 and 1911. To avoid the type of situation which led to the riots, producers and growers of the Champagne region formed an agreement that developed the √âchelle des Crus system where prices would be set by a joint committee of producers and growers, fairly applied and based on the presumed quality of a village's vineyards. In recent times there has been discussion of modifying the classification and going to a \\"Burgundy-like\\" system whereby vineyards, rather than villages, would be the basis of ratings. Critics charge that a system based on rating an entire village ignores terroir differences within the large area of a village. Pricing structure A Grand Cru Champagne The √âchelle des Crus was originally established as a fixed pricing structure. The price for a kilogram of grapes was set and vineyards owners would receive a fraction of that price depending on the village rating where they were located. Vineyards in Grand cru villages would receive 100% of the price while Premiers crus villages with a 95 rating would receive 95% of the price and so forth down the line. Today the business dynamic between Champagne houses and vineyards owners is not so strictly regulated but the classification system still serves as an aid in determining prices with Grand and Premier cru vineyards receiving considerably more for their grapes than vineyards in villages with ratings below 90%.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pg 175 Workman Publishing 2001 Grands crus Vineyards in the Grand cru village of Verzenay When the √âchelle des Crus was first established, 12 villages received Grand cru status. In 1985 that number was expanded to 17 with the promotion of five villages (Chouilly, Mesnil-sur-Oger, Oger, Oiry and Verzy). Less than 9% of all the planted vineyard land in Champagne have received a 100% Grand cru rating.S.

Champagne is primarily a product of vast blending - of different grape varieties, different vintages and different vineyards - with a typical non-vintage blend being composed of grapes from up to 80 different vineyards. However, for their prestige cuvee (such as Mo√´t et Chandon's Dom P√©rignon or Louis Roederer's Cristal) Champagne producers will often limit the grape sources to only Grand cru (and sometimes Premier crus) vineyards. While single vineyard Champagnes are rare, they do exist, such as Krug's Clos du Mesnil coming from the Grand cru vineyard located near Le Mesnil-sur-Oger.Oz Clarke \\"Oz Clarke's New Wine Atlas\\" pg 71-72 Harcourt Trade, 2002 Grower Champagnes, the product of a single producer and vineyard owner, located in Grand cru villages will often label their wines \\"100% Grand cru\\" if their wines qualify for the designation.

Northeast Los Angeles (abbreviated NELA) is a region of Los Angeles County, comprising seven neighborhoods within the City of Los Angeles. The area is home to Occidental College located in Eagle Rock. History The bulk of the area closer to Pueblo de Los Angeles-Downtown Los Angeles was part of the original Spanish and Mexican land grants of Rancho San Rafael and Rancho San Pascual when the city incorporated in 1850. One of the first annexations of the city was Highland Park in 1895. Other nearby communities attached to Los Angeles were Garvanza (1899), Arroyo Seco (1912) and Eagle Rock (1923). Development in the Northeast was fostered by service of the Los Angeles Railway \\"Yellow Cars.\\" Traditionally a heavily Latino and working-class part of the city, Northeast Los Angeles has undergone gentrification starting in the 2000s. With the influx of young professionals, Northeast Los Angeles has gained attention for its hipster culture and a new wave of commercial development; however, increasing housing prices have caused tensions with long-time residents. Geography  According to the Mapping L.A. survey of the Los Angeles Times, Northeast Los Angeles consists of a region bounded on the south and west by the Interstate 5, the north by the cities of Glendale and Pasadena, and bounded on the east by the Arroyo Seco Parkway. Much of Northeast Los Angeles is located on or around the San Rafael Hills. Southwest Museum of the American Indian. The same survey identifies the following seven neighborhoods as comprising Northeast Los Angeles: * Atwater Village * Cypress Park * Eagle Rock * Montecito Heights * Glassell Park * Highland Park * Mount Washington * Lincoln Heights Other neighborhoods within the region are: *Arroyo Seco *Elysian Valley *Garvanza *Heritage Square *Hermon Population 2000 census = In the 2000 census, Northeast Los Angeles had 167,674 residents in its 17.18 square miles, which amounted to 9,757 people per square mile. The densest neighborhood was Highland Park, and the least dense was Mount Washington.\\"Northeast L.A.,\\" Mapping L.A. Los Angeles Times About 54% of the area's population lived in rental units, while 46% lived in owner-occupied housing. Highland Park was the neighborhood with the highest rental occupancy, and Eagle Rock had the lowest. The latter district also had the oldest population, and Cypress Park had the youngest. Eagle Rock also was the wealthiest neighborhood and Cypress Park the poorest. Eagle Rock was the neighborhood with the largest percentage of residents holding a four-year academic degree and Cypress Park had the lowest percentage. The ethnic breakdown in 2000 was Latino, 62.5%; White, 16.6%, Asian, 16.0%; Black, 2.0%, and Other, 2.9%. Eagle Rock was the most ethnically diverse neighborhood and Cypress Park the least. Transportation The area is well-served by freeways and public transportation. California's first freeway, the 1940 Arroyo Seco Parkway (SR 110), connects the area with Downtown and Pasadena. Interstate 5 (the Golden State Freeway) and Interstate 10 (the San Bernardino Freeway) lie directly to the south of the district.

While tasked with helping to catch other hackers and fugitives wanted by the FBI, he continued to commit serious crimes. Life Justin Petersen, born on July 28, 1960 in Washington D.C., started hacking computers in 1978. In 1984, he moved to Los Angeles. It was there he found an affinity for Los Angeles night life, with the Sunset Strip being a major focal point. In 1989, Petersen, using the handle Agent Steal and the alias Eric Heinz that he had been living under since his departure from the East, cracked the computers of the Pacific Bell Telephone Company in California and used his access to intercept the telephone lines of several local FM radio stations. With this access, he and a couple of associates were able to ensure that they were the only callers who could get through during on-air contests, and thus the only winners. Although the associates remain officially unknown, strong rumors persist that Kevin Poulsen (aka Dark Dante), and Ronald Austin were involved. Their winnings included $50,000 in cash, several trips to Hawaii and two Porsches. Realizing he was being pursued by the FBI, Petersen moved to Texas, where he then hacked into a national credit reporting agency, ordered fraudulent credit cards using the information he found, and used them freely. After receiving a tip, Petersen was arrested in Texas in 1991. In an FBI affidavit, Petersen admitted to physically and electronically conducting illegal telephone taps and breaking into Pacific Bell's COSMOS and other companies' computer systems to check telephone numbers and determine the location of telephone lines and circuits. A grand jury in Texas returned an eight-count indictment, accusing Petersen of assuming false identities, accessing a computer without authorization, possessing stolen account IDs and fraudulently obtaining and using credit cards. Petersen also faced several other charges pertaining to national security: one charge regarded his supposed compilation and documentation of U.S. Federal Government wire taps of persons currently under surveillance. Under a plea bargain the charge was dropped after a debriefing by unknown law enforcement entities (presumably the FBI or US Secret Service), according to Littman. The case was ultimately transferred to California. Petersen eventually pleaded guilty to six counts, including the aforementioned rigging of a radio station contest to win a $20,000 prize. He faced a sentence of up to 40 years in prison and a $1.5 million fine, but sentencing was delayed several times as Petersen became an informant for the FBI for almost two years. He had said that the FBI paid him monthly, plus free rent, computers and other unspecified resources \\"to help them set up hackers,\\" including Kevin Mitnick (aka Condor), and Kevin Poulsen (aka Dark Dante), and others. On 18 October 1993, 15 months after entering his first guilty plea, Petersen was confronted inside a federal courthouse by David J. Schindler, Assistant US Attorney for the prosecution (who is now a private attorney for the Church of Scientology, ) who asked if he had committed any crimes while free on bail. Petersen asked to have a conference with his attorney, according to Schindler. Petersen met briefly with his attorney, then escaped from the federal courthouse becoming a fugitive once again. Attorney Richard Sherman, who represented a friend of Kevin Mitnick's in another computer crime case, accused the FBI of not only using Petersen as an informant, but also of turning a blind eye to alleged computer and credit- card crimes Petersen committed during his time cooperating. Petersen also claims the FBI refused to allow him to work with or on computers afterward. Given his physical limitations resulting from an accident in 1985, and legal restrictions imposed by the FBI, Petersen claimed he had little choice but to briefly turn back to hacking since he was unable to get a job. While still a fugitive, Petersen allegedly hacked into the computers of Heller Financial, a commercial lending company. An unnamed associate phoned in two bomb threats to the bank. While the building was being evacuated, Petersen allegedly initiated a wire transfer of $150,000 from Heller Financial to Union Bank, by way of Mellon Bank. The transfer was discovered before his associate could withdraw the money. In November 1995, Peterson was sentenced to 41 months (3.4 years) in U.S. federal prison and three years of probation, and payment of restitution of $40,000. It is rumored that Petersen worked for the Central Intelligence Agency in Amsterdam, although details are unclear. Scientology Author Jonathan Littman in his book, linked Petersen's sealed Texas court case with the Church of Scientology via a private investigator (in Beverly Hills, California) named Shlomi Michaels and former FBI Special Agent in Charge Ted Gunderson. The firm he worked for contracted him to eavesdrop on the Aznarans, who were high-ranking ex-Scientologists living in the state of Texas. The Aznarans were at the time cooperating with Richard Behar in the writing of the highly critical 1991 Time magazine cover story. Vicki and Richard Aznarans left the church under circumstances that they describe as involving duress. They filed a complaint against Scientology alleging false imprisonment, intentional infliction of emotional distress and other tortious conduct. Death Petersen was found dead in his Los Angeles apartment on March 12, 2010.http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/latimes/obituary.aspx?pid=140791032 L.A.

This technique is supported by Microsoft SQL Server, How to Perform SQL Server Log Shipping , \\"What is Log Shipping\\". Retrieved on 2008-12-16. 4D Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. Similar to replication, the primary purpose of log shipping is to increase database availability by maintaining a backup server that can replace a production server quickly. Other databases such as Adaptive Server Enterprise and Oracle Database support the technique but require the Database Administrator to write code or scripts to perform the work. Although the actual failover mechanism in log shipping is manual, this implementation is often chosen due to its low cost in human and server resources, and ease of implementation. In comparison, SQL server clusters enable automatic failover, but at the expense of much higher storage costs. Compared to database replication, log shipping does not provide as much in terms of reporting capabilities, but backs up system tables along with data tables, and locks the standby server from users' modifications. A replicated server can be modified (e.g. views) and is therefore unsuitable for failover purposes.

It is bounded by Huangpu Avenue on the north, the Pearl River on the south, Guangzhou Avenue on the west and the South China Expressway on the east. Covering an area of 6.44 km2, the area is divided by Xiancun Road () into two parts. The larger eastern part contains mainly high-end residential complexes and the Zhujiang Park, which lies at the centre. Such a layout was modelled on the Central Park in New York where the park itself provides a green oasis in the city centre and increases the value of surrounding properties. The western portion of Zhujiang New Town was planned as the city's new CBD for the 21st century. Its core area, which the government designated as the city's new axis of development, is a continuous open plaza which extends approximately 1.5 km from Huangpu Avenue to the Pearl River. The plaze incorporates underground shopping malls, vehicular tunnels and a people mover system. Flanked by skyscrapers, at its southern end it hosts four newly built cultural venues of the city: the Guangzhou Opera House, the second Children's Palace, the new Guangzhou Library and Guangdong Museum. Immediately to the north of these buildings are the supertall Twin Towers and across the river stands the Canton Tower, which is the tallest structure in Guangzhou. While planning of Zhujiang New Town began as early as in the late 1980s, development had stagnated for more than a decade. To encourage development, the local government relocated some of its departments to the area, including the customs officeBlueprint of Zhujiang New TownLandmark Plazas to Break Ground in Zhujiang New TownGuangzhou customs office moved to Zhujiang new town and the taxation bureau. A piece of land measuring about 3 hectares was specifically reserved and sold to the U.S. Consulate. Private companies however, were reluctant to move in due to the poor traffic connection and a lack of other amenities at that time. Eventually in 2003 the government carried out a planning review of the area, in which some major adjustments were made to the original plan including more public facilities and transport infrastructure being added to the original plan. The area finally met its opportunity of rapid development as the city prepared to host the 2010 Asian Games. The adjacent Haixinsha island was chosen as the venue of the opening ceremony, as a result the area attracted large investment from the government and property developers. Today Zhujiang New Town has the largest concentration of luxurious hotels and office buildings in the city. Zhujiang New Town is served by a dedicated people mover system and the Zhujiang New Town station of Guangzhou Metro.

She has also been the ghostwriter for novelizations of television series such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Charmed and Fearless. Early years Ostow was born in New York City to a Jewish-American father and a Puerto Rican mother. Even though she was raised in the Jewish faith (her mother, who was a Catholic, converted before she married her father), she always maintained a good relationship and remained close to her Puerto Rican Catholic family. In 1990, when her grandmother was dying in Puerto Rico, she joined her immediate family and other members of the family who traveled from Florida, New York, and other places to the island to be with her. The experience of seeing how easily the family banded together, despite the fact that some of them had never even met before, served as an inspirational factor when she wrote her first novel Emily Goldberg Learns to Salsa.Live Journal Raised in South Orange, New Jersey, Ostow graduated from Solomon Schechter Day School of Essex and Union (now Golda Och Academy), a Jewish day school in West Orange.Rubin, Debra. \\"Day school and punk rock collide in teen novel\\", New Jersey Jewish News, December 6, 2010.

Science and technology is a growing field in Pakistan and has played an important role in the country's development since its founding. Pakistan has a large pool of scientists, engineers, doctors, and technicians assuming an active role in science and technology. Liaquat Ali Khan the first Prime Minister of Pakistan (in office 15 August 1947 ‚Äì 16 October 1951), made various reforms to initiate improvement in higher education and scientific research. The real growth in science in Pakistan occurred after the establishment of the Higher education Commission in 2002 which supported science in a big way and also became the major sponsor of the Pakistan Academy of Sciences under the leadership of Prof. Atta-ur-Rahman. The first IT policy and implementation strategy was approved under the leadership of Prof. Atta- ur-Rahman, then Federal Minister of Science & technology, in August 2000 which laid the foundations of the development of this sectorhttp://www.moit.gov.pk/moit/userfiles1/file/policies/Pakistan%20IT%20Policy%20%20Action%20Plan%202000.pdf On the request of Prof. Atta-ur-Rahman, Intel initiated a nationwide programme to train school teachers in Information and Communication technologies in March 2002 which has led to the training of 220,000 school teachers in 70 districts and cities across Pakistan. A 15-year tax holiday was approved on the recommendation of Prof. Atta-ur-Rahman which has resulted in growth of IT business from $30 million in 2001 to over $3 billion. The Pakistan Austria University of Applied Engineering (Fachhochschule) is now being established in Haripur Hazara under the Chairmanship of Prof. Atta-ur-Rahman in which students will get degrees from several Austrian universities. Pakistan's growth in scientific output can be seen from the fact that in 1990 Pakistan published 926 scholarly documents while in 2018 the number rose to 20548, a twenty times increase.In contrast India published 21443 scholarly documents in 1990 and the number rose to 171356 in 2018, an eight times increase. In 2018, 336 people per million were researchers in the R&D; (Research and Development sector) in Pakistan compared to 256 people per million being researchers in India. Chemistry remains the strongest subject in the country with the International Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences playing the lead role with the largest postgraduate research program in the country having about 600 students enrolled for PhD.Physics (theoretical, nuclear, particle, laser, and quantum physics), material science, metallurgy (engineering), biology, and mathematics, are some of the other fields in which Pakistani scientists have contributed. From the 1960s and onwards, the Pakistani government made the development and advancement of science a national priority and showered top scientists with honours. While the government has made efforts to make science a part of national development, there have been criticisms of federal policies, such as the government's dissolution of the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan (HEC)‚Äî an administrative body that supervised research in science ‚Äì in 2011. This attempted dissolution failed to materialise because of a Supreme Court of Pakistan decision on a petition filed by Prof. Atta-ur-Rahman, former Federal Minister of Science & Technology and former founding Chairman of the Higher Education Commission. Pakistani scientists have also won acclaim in mathematics and in several branches of physical science, notably theoretical and nuclear physics, chemistry, and astronomy. Professor Abdus Salam, a theoretical physicist won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1979, being the first and only Pakistani to date to have received the honor. Prof. Atta-ur-Rahman an organic chemist was elected as Fellow of Royal Society (London) in 2006 in recognition of his contributions in the field of natural products thereby becoming the first scientist from the Islamic world to receive this honour for work carried out within an Islamic country. The contributions of Prof. Atta-ur-Rahman to uplift science and higher education in Pakistan were internationally acknowledged and a tribute paid to him in the world's leading science journal Nature that termed him as \\"a force of nature\\". In an analysis of scientific research productivity of Pakistan, in comparison to Brazil, Russia, India, and China, Thomson Reuters has applauded the developments that have taken place as a result of the reforms introduced by Prof. Atta-ur-Rahman FRS, since Pakistan has emerged as the country with the highest increase in the percentage of highly cited papers in comparison to the \\"BRIC\\" countries. In recognition of building strong bridges between science in Pakistan and China, Prof. Atta-ur-Rahman FRS has been selected to receive the highest national award of China, the \\"International Science and Technology Cooperation Award\\".https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/581104-dr-atta-to-receive-highest- international-s-t-cooperation-award-of-china Technology is highly developed in nuclear physics and explosives engineering, where the arms race with India convinced policymakers to set aside sufficient resources for research. Due to a programme directed by Munir Ahmad Khan and the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC), Pakistan is the seventh nation to have developed an atomic bomb, which the global intelligence community believes it had done by 1983 (see Kirana-I), nine years after India (see Pokhran-I). Pakistan first publicly tested its devices (see Chagai-I and Chagai-II) on 28 and 30 May 1998, two weeks after India carried out its own tests (See Pokhran-II). Space exploration was hastily developed, in 1990 Pakistan launched Badr-1 followed by Badr-II in 2001. Since the 1980s, the space programme dedicated itself to military technologies (Space weapons programme and Integrated missile systems), and maintains a strong programme developed for military applications. Pakistan is an associate member of CERN, one of the few countries to obtain that status. History The Scientific and Technological Research Division (S&TR;) was established in 1964 for (i) coordination and implementation of national science and technology policy; (ii) promotion and coordination of research and utilization of the results of research; (iii) development, production and utilization of nuclear energy; and (iv) coordination of utilization of scientific and technological manpower. The Division was administratively responsible for the National Science Council, the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the Atomic Energy Commission and Space and Upper Atmospheric Research Committee. The Ministry of Science and Technology (MoS&T;) has been functioning since 1972. It is the national focal point and enabling arm of Government of Pakistan for planning, coordinating and directing efforts; to initiate and launch scientific and technological programs and projects as per national agenda for sound and sustainable Science & Technology Research base for the socio-economic development. From the areas of industrial development to renewable energy and rural development, the Ministry suggests technological development for higher growth-rates and to improve standards of living. Its principal focus is on building Pakistan's technological competence and developing a larger pool of human resources to reverse brain drain, and for integrating the existing technological infrastructure for the strengthening of technology institutions, effective governance of S&TR; and enhancing the capacity of indigenous innovation systems. State controlled science Unlike some Western countries, the majority of the research programmes are conducted not at the institutions (such as universities) but at specially set up research facilities and institutes. These institutes are performed under the government's Ministry of Science that overlooks the development and promotion of science in the country, while others are performed under the Pakistan Academy of Sciences, other specialized academies and even the research arms of various government ministries. At first, the core of fundamental science was the Pakistan Academy of Sciences, originally set up in 1953 and moved from Karachi to Islamabad in 1964. The Pakistan Academy of Sciences has a large percentage of researchers in the natural sciences, particularly physics. From 1947 to 1971, the research was being conducted independently with no government influence. The High Tension Laboratories (HTL) at the Government College University, Lahore (GCU) was established by R. M. Chaudhry with funds given by the British government in the 1950s. In 1967, Professor Abdus Salam led the foundation of the Institute of Theoretical Physics (ITP) at the Quaid- e-Azam University, and the establishment of the Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology (PINSTECH) and the Centre for Nuclear Studies; all were independently established by Pakistan's academic scientists with financial assistance provided by European countries. However, after Zulfikar Ali Bhutto became president, he took control of scientific research in 1972 as part of his intensified socialist reforms and policies. With advice taken from Dr. Mubashir Hassan, Bhutto established the Ministry of Science with Ishrat Hussain Usmani, a bureaucrat with a doctorate in atomic physics. During the 1950s and 1960s, both West Pakistan and East Pakistan had their own academies of science, with East Pakistan relying on West Pakistan to allot the funds. Medical research is coordinated and funded by the Health Ministry and agricultural research is led by Agriculture Ministry and likewise, the research on environmental sciences is headed by the Environment Ministry. The aftermath of the 1971 Indo-Pakistan Winter War was that President Bhutto increased scientific funding by the Government by more than 200%, mostly dedicated to military research and development. Bhutto, with the help of his Science Adviser Dr. Salam, gathered hundreds of Pakistani scientists working abroad to develop what became Pakistan's atom bomb. This crash programme was directed at first by Dr. Abdus Salam until 1974, and then directed and led by Dr. Munir Ahmad Khan from 1974 until 1991. For the first time, an effort was made by the government when Pakistan's citizens made advancements in nuclear physics, theoretical physics, and mathematics. In the 1980s, General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq radicalized science by enforcing pseudoscience ‚Äì by his Muslim fundamentalists as administrators ‚Äì in Pakistan's schools and universities. Zia-ul-Haq later promoted Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan to export the sensitive industrial (military) technologies to Libya, Iran, and North Korea. Because of government control, academic research in Pakistan remains highly classified and unknown to the international scientific community. There have been several failed attempts made by foreign powers to infiltrate the country's research facilities to learn how much research has progressed and how much clandestine knowledge has been gained by Pakistan's scientists.Brigadier-General Syed A. I. Tirmazi (1985). Profiles of Intelligence. Combined Printers. Library of Congress Catalogue No. 95-930455. One of the notable cases was in the 1970s when the Libyan intelligence made an unsuccessful attempt to gain knowledge on critical aspects of nuclear technology, and crucial mathematical fast neutron calculations in theoretical physics. It was thwarted by the ISI Directorate for Joint Intelligence Technical (JIT). From the 1980s and onward, both Russian intelligence and the Central Intelligence Agency made several attempts to access Pakistan's research but because of the ISI, they were unable to gain any information. From the period 1980 to 2004, research in science fell short until General Pervez Mushrraf established the Higher Education Commission (HEC) which heightened the contribution of science and technology in Pakistan. The major boost to science in Pakistan occurred under the leadership of Prof. Atta-ur-Rahman as the founding Chairman of the Higher Education Commission when about 11,000 students were sent to top universities abroad for Ph.D. and postdoctoral training. This has resulted in the enormous increase in the research output of Pakistan in Impact factor journals from about 800 per year in the year 2000 to over 12,000 publications per year. This drew positive comments from Thomson Reuters about the sharp increase in highly cited papers in comparison to Brazil, Russia, India and China Major research was undertaken by Pakistan's institutes in the field of natural sciences. In 2003, the Ministry of Science and Technology of the Government of Pakistan and the United States Department of State signed a comprehensive Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement that established a framework to increase cooperation in science, technology, engineering and education for mutual benefit and peaceful purposes between the science and education communities in both countries. In 2005, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) joined with the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) and the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan to support the joint Pakistan-U.S. Science and Technology Cooperation Program. Beginning in 2008, the U.S. Department of State joined USAID as U.S. co-sponsor of the program. This program, which is being implemented by the National Academy of Sciences on the U.S. side, is intended to increase the strength and breadth of cooperation and linkages between Pakistan scientists and institutions with counterparts in the United States. However, with unfavourable situations, research declined. In 2011, the government dissolved the HEC and the control of education was taken over by governmental ministries. Prof. Atta-ur-Rahman filed a petition in the Supreme Court of Pakistan against the government action. The Supreme Court decided in favour of the stand taken by Prof. Atta- ur-Rahman, and the federal nature of the Higher Education Commission was preserved.

However, it was not until 2012 that Pakistan's first National Science, Technology and Innovation Policy was formulated: this was also the first time that the government had formally recognized innovation as being a long-term strategy for driving economic growth. The policy principally emphasizes the need for human resource development, endogenous technology development, technology transfer and greater international co-operation in research and development (R&D;). The policy was informed by the technology foresight exercise undertaken by the Pakistan Council for Science and Technology from 2009 onwards. By 2014, studies had been completed in 11 areas: agriculture, energy, ICTs, education, industry, environment, health, biotechnology, water, nanotechnology, and electronics. Further foresight studies were planned on pharmaceuticals, microbiology, space technology, public health, sewage, and sanitation, as well as higher education. = National Science, Technology and Innovation Strategy = Following the change of government in Islamabad after the May 2013 general election, the new Ministry of Science and Technology issued the draft National Science, Technology and Innovation Strategy 2014‚Äì2018, along with a request for comments from the public. This strategy has been mainstreamed into the government's long-term development plan, Vision 2025, a first for Pakistan.  Investment in human resources and research  The central pillar of the draft National Science, Technology and Innovation Strategy is human development. Although the pathway to implementation is not detailed, the new strategy fixes a target of raising Pakistan's gross domestic expenditure on R&D; (GERD) from 0.29% (2013) to 0.5% of GDP by 2015 then to 1% of GDP by the end of the current government's five- year term in 2018. The ambitious target of tripling the GERD/GDP ratio in just seven years is a commendable expression of the government's resolve but ambitious reforms will need to be implemented concurrently to achieve the desired outcome.

National prizes The most prestigious government prize awarded for achievements in science and technology is Nishan-e-Imtiaz (or in English Order of Excellence). While Hilal-i-Imtiaz, Sitara-i-Imtiaz, and Tamgha-e-Imtiaz occupies a unique role and importance in Pakistan's civil society. Atta-ur- Rahman is the only scientist of Pakistan to have won all these 4 Civil Awards. Achievements In 1961, international achievements first recorded in 1961 when Pakistan became the third Asian country and tenth in the world when the Rehbar-I ‚Äì a solid fuel expendable rocket‚Äî was launched from Sonmani Spaceport. The Rehbar-I was developed and launched under the leadership of Dr. W. J. M. Turowicz, a Polish-Pakistani scientist and then project director of this program. Since then, the program began taking flights which continued until the 1970s. A major breakthrough occurred in 1979, when the Nobel Prize Committee awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics to Abdus Salam, for formulating the electroweak theory ‚Äì a theory that provides the basis of unification of weak nuclear force and electromagnetic force. In 1990, the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO) launched the first, and locally designed, a communication satellite, Badr-1, from Xichang Satellite Launch Center (XLSC) of the People's Republic of China. With the launch, Pakistan became the first Muslim majority country to have developed an artificial robotic satellite, and was the second South Asian state to have launched its satellite, second to India. One of the widely reported achievements was in 1998 when the country joined the nuclear club. In response to India's nuclear tests on 11 May and 13 May 1998, under codename Operation Shakti, in the long- constructed Pokhran Test Range (PTR). Under Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) conducted five simultaneous tests at the Chagai Hills under codename Chagai-I on 28 May 1998. PAEC carried out another test in the Kharan Desert, under Chagai-II, meaning it had tested six devices in under one week. With the testing of these atomic devices, Pakistan became the seventh nuclear power in the world, and the only Muslim-majority country to have mastered the technology. On 13 August 2011, SUPARCO launched its first indigenously developed geosynchronous satellite, Paksat-1R also from XLSC in China. In 2006 Prof. Atta-ur-Rahman was elected as Fellow of Royal Society (London), thereby becoming the first scientist from the Muslim world to be so honoured in recognition of researches and contributions carried out within an Islamic country. He has major contributions to the development of science and technology as Chairman Higher Education Commission during 2002‚Äì2008 which have resulted in a significant increase in research publications in Pakistan from only about 800 research papers in Impact Factor journals in 2002 to over 11,000 publications in 2016 the quality of which has been recognised by ThomsonReuters. The International Centre for Chemical and Biological Sciences at the University of Karachi which has developed as a leading research centre in the region under the leadership of Prof. Atta-ur- Rahman was designated as a UNESCO Centre of Excellence in 2016. Prof. Atta-ur- Rahman was awarded the high Civil Award of the Government of Austria (the 'Grosses goldenes Ehrenzeichen am Bande') in 2007 in recognition for his contributions for uplifting science in Pakistan, and the Government of China also honoured him with the highest Award for Foreigners (Friendship Award) in recognition of his eminent contributions.http://news.uniquepakistan.com.pk/chinas-highest-national-award- prof-atta-ur-rahman/ The largest university of Malaysia, Universiti Teknologi Mara, established a Research Centre entitled \\" Dr. Atta-ur-Rahman Research Institute of natural Product Discovery\\" to honour this great Muslim scientist for uplifting science in Pakistan and in the Muslim world in his capacity as Coordinator General COMSTECH, a Ministerial Committee comprising 57 Ministers of Science and Technology of the 57 OIC member countries. More recently, the leading Chinese University on Traditional Medicine in Changsha, Hunan has also decided to neame a research institute in honour of Prof. Atta-ur-Rahman FRS, in recognition of his eminent contributions to uplift science in Pakistan and to establish strong linkages with China.https://tribune.com.pk/story/1982029/1-chinese-research-center-named-dr- attaur-rahman/ In 2017, a Chinese study published in Scientometrics (journal) revealed that Pakistan's research growth rate and time required to double the number of publications is superior than that of USA, China and India. In another landmark study undertaken by Thomson Reuters, highlighting the impact of the reforms introduced by Atta-ur-Rahman, it was revealed that the rate of growth of highly cited papers from Pakistan in a decade was even greater than that in Brazil, Russia, India or China  Information technology  The rapid progress made by Pakistan in the IT and telecom sector during 2000‚Äì2002, under Professor Atta-ur-Rahman as Federal Minister, led to the spread of internet from 29 cities in the year 2000 to 1,000 cities, towns and villages by 2002, and the spread of fiber from 40 cities to 400 cities in this period. The first IT policy and implementation strategy was approved under the leadership of Prof. Atta-ur-Rahman, then Federal Minister of Science & technology, in August 2000 which laid the foundations of the development of this sector The internet prices were reduced sharply from $87,000 per month for a 2 MB line to only $3000 per month and later to $90 per month. The mobile telephony boom also occurred under the leadership of Atta-ur-Rahman, and it began by the drastic lowering of prices, bringing in of competition (Ufone) and changing the system so that the person receiving a call was no longer required to pay any charges. A satellite was placed in space (Paksat 1) at a cost of only $4 million. These changes in the IT infra-structure proved invaluable for the Higher education sector. Pakistan Educational Research Network was set up in 2004 through which one of the finest digital libraries was established in universities. In 2002, few university libraries could subscribe to a handful of journals. Today every student in every public sector university has free access to over 20,000 international journals with back volumes and over 60,000 books from 250 international publishers. As of 2011, Pakistan has over 20 million internet users and is ranked as one of the top countries that have registered a high growth rate in internet penetration. Overall, it has the 15th largest population of internet users in the world. In the fiscal year 2012‚Äì2013, the Government of Pakistan aims to spend 4.6 billion rupees (Rs.) on information technology projects, with emphasis on e-government, human resource and infrastructure development.Information technology in Pakistan Pakistan's information technology industry has gone through a dramatic change, and the country has taken the lead in adopting some technologies while also setting an example for others in global best practices. Matters relating to the IT industry are overseen and regulated by the Ministry of Information Technology of the Government of Pakistan. The IT industry is regarded as a successful sector of Pakistan economically, even during the financial crisis. The Government of Pakistan has given numerous favors to IT investors in the country since the last decade, that resulted in the development of the IT sector. In the years 2003‚Äì2005 the country's IT exports saw a rise of about fifty percent and amounted a total of about US$48.5 million. The World Economic Forum, assessing the development of Information and Communication Technology in the country ranked Pakistan 102nd among 144 countries in the Global Information Technology report of 2012. Golden age of science The 1960s and the 1970s period is regarded as the initial rise of Pakistan's science, which gained an international reputation in the different science communities of the world. During this period, scientists contributed to the fields of, particularly, Natural Product Chemistry, theoretical, particle, mathematical, and nuclear physics, and other major and subfields of Chemistry and Physics. The research was preceded by such scientists as Riazuddin, Ishfaq Ahmad, Salimuzzaman Siddiqui, Atta-ur-Rahman and Samar Mubarakmand. However, the major growth in scientific output occurred after the establishment of the Higher Education Commission which was accompanied by a 60-fold increase in funding for science The real growth of science in Pakistan occurred under the leadership of Prof. Atta-ur-Rahman during 2000‚Äì2008 when he was the Federal Minister of Science & Technology and later Chairman of the Higher Education Commission (HEC) with the status of Federal Minister. The chairperson of the Senate Standing Committee on Education announced the first 6 years of HEC under Prof. Atta-ur-Rahman as \\"Pakistan's golden period\\".Voelter, Wolfgang. \\"The golden period\\". Dawn ePaper. The golden period, The Dawn, retrieved 20 March 2010 Thomson Reuters, in an independent assessment of Pakistan's progress in international publications, has acknowledged that in the last decade there has been a fourfold increase in international publications and a tenfold growth in highly cited papers, statistics that were better than the BRIC countries.http://images.info.science.thomsonreuters.biz/Web/ThomsonReutersScience/%7Bdab71dc1-d7d8-48af-88a6-fa7efa61ae22%7D_Pakistan_Citation_Report_FINAL.pdf The remarkable transformation of science and higher education under the leadership of Prof. Atta-ur-Rahman as Federal Minister of Science & Technology and later as Chairman of Higher Education Commission with status of a Federal Minister during the period 2000‚Äì2008 was applauded by many independent experts and he was called a \\"force of nature\\" in a review published in Nature Dr. Abdus Salam, the first Pakistani winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics, was the father of physics research in Pakistan. Under the watchful direction of Salam, mathematicians and physicists tackled the greatest and outstanding problems in physics and mathematics. From 1960 to 1974, Salam was responsible for leading the research at its maximum point. This prompted the international recognition of Pakistani mathematicians and physicists, allowing them to conduct their research at CERN. Salam and his students (Riazuddin, Fayyazuddin, and others) revolutionized particle and theoretical physics, are thought to be modern pioneers of particle physics at all aspect of it. Pure research was undertaken in Quantum electrodynamics, Quantum field theory, protonic decay and major fields in physics, were pioneered by Pakistan's scientists. With the establishment of nuclear and neutron institutes in the country, Pakistan's mathematicians introduced complex mathematical applications to study and examine the behaviours of elements during the fission process. Salimuzzaman Siddiqui, Atta-ur-Rahman and Iqbal Choudhary are the pioneering personalities for studying the isolation of unique chemical compounds from the Neem (Azadirachta indica), Rauvolfia, periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus), (Buxus papillosa) and various other plants. Higher education reforms Reform 2002‚Äì2009 = In 2002, the University Grants Commission was replaced by the Higher Education Commission (HEC), which has an independent chairperson. The HEC was charged with reforming Pakistan's higher education system by introducing better financial incentives, increasing university enrolment and the number of PhD graduates, boosting foreign scholarships and research collaboration and providing all the major universities with state-of-the-art ICT facilities. In a series of reforms in 2002, the HEC instituted major upgrades for scientific laboratories, rehabilitating existing educational facilities, expanding research support and overseeing the development of one of the best digital libraries in the region. Seeking to meet international standards, quality assurance and accreditation process was also established. Some ~95% of students sent abroad for training returned, an unusually high result for a developing country, in response to improved salaries and working conditions at universities as well as bonding and strict follow-up by the commission, Fulbright and others. Within a limited timespan, the HEC provided all universities with free, high-speed Internet access to scientific literature, an upgrade of research equipment accessible across the country and a programme for the creation of new universities of science and technology, including science parks which attracted foreign investors.  International praise for these reforms  Since the Higher Education Commission (HEC) reforms have been carried out in 2002, HEC has received praise from international higher education observers. Rahman, founding Chairman of HEC, has received a number of international awards for the transformation of the higher education sector under his leadership.[25] German academic, Dr. Wolfgang Voelter of T√ºbingen University in Germany over viewed the performance of HEC under the leadership of Rahman and described the reforms in HEC as \\"A miracle happened.\\" After teaching and visiting in 15 universities of Pakistan, Voelter wrote that the \\"scenario of education, science and technology in Pakistan has changed dramatically, as never before in the history of the country.[25] The chairperson of the Senate Standing Committee on Education recently announced the first 6 years of HEC under Rahman as \\"Pakistan's golden period in higher education\\". American academic Prof. Fred M. Hayward has also praised the reform process undertaken by Pakistan, admitting that \\"since 2002, a number of extraordinary changes have taken place.\\"Hayward, Fred M. (Winter 2009).Higher Education Transformation in Pakistan: Political & Economic Instability, International Higher Education Quarterly (54), retrieved 20 March 2010 Hayward pointed out that \\"over the last six years almost 4,000 scholars have participated in Ph.D. programs in Pakistan in which more than 600 students have studied in foreign PhD programs'. The HEC's reforms were also applauded by the United Nations Commission on Science and Technology for Development (UNCSTD) which reported that the \\"progress made was breath-taking and has put Pakistan ahead of comparable countries in numerous aspects.\\"Rode, Bernd Michael. Letter from Chairman/European Coordinator of ASEA-UNINET published in DAWN today, DildilpakistanWordpress, retrieved 10 March 2010 The UNCSTD has closely monitored the development in Pakistan in the past years, coming to the conclusion that HEC's program initiated under the leadership of Rahman is a \\"best-practice\\" example for developing countries aiming at building their human resources and establishing an innovative, technology- based economy.\\". According to an article published in the leading science journal Nature \\"Rahman's strong scientific background, enthusiasm for reform and impressive ability to secure cash made him a hit at home and abroad. \\"It really was an anomaly that we had a person of that stature with that kind of backing,----Atta-ur-Rahman was a force of nature Rahman has won four international awards for the revolutionary changes in the higher education sector brought in the HEC. Nature, a leading science journal, has also written a number of editorials and articles about the transformation brought about in Pakistan in the higher education sector under the HEC. In an article entitled \\"Pakistan Threat to Indian Science\\" published in the leading daily newspaper Hindustan Times, India, it has been reported that Professor C. N. R. Rao, Chairman of the Indian Prime Minister's Scientific Advisory Council made a presentation to the Indian Prime Minister at the rapid progress made by Pakistan in the higher education sector under the leadership of Rahman, Chairman, Higher Education Commission. It was reported that as a result of the reforms, \\"Pakistan may soon join China in giving India serious competition in science\\". \\"Science is a lucrative profession in Pakistan. It has tripled the salaries of its scientists in the last few years.\\"Pak threat to Indian science, Hindustan Times, 23 July 2006, retrieved 19 March 2012 = Decentralizing the governance of higher education = In 2011‚Äì2012, the HEC found itself on the brink of dissolution in the face of the 18th amendment to the Constitution, which devolved several governance functions to provincial governments, including that of higher education. It was only after the Supreme Court intervened in April 2011, in response to a petition from the former Chair of the HEC, that the commission was spared from being divided up among the four Provinces of Baluchistan, Khyber‚ÄìPakhtunkhwa, Punjab and Sindh. Notwithstanding this, the HEC's developmental budget ‚Äì that spent on scholarships and faculty training, etc. ‚Äì was slashed by 37.8% in 2011‚Äì2012, from a peak of R. 22.5 billion (circa US$0.22 billion) in 2009‚Äì2010 to Rs 14 billion (circa US$0.14 billion). The higher education sector continues to face an uncertain future, despite the marginal increase in developmental spending wrought by the new administration in Islamabad: Rs. 18.5 billion (circa US$0.18 billion) in the 2013‚Äì2014 budget. According to HEC statistics, the organization's budget as a percentage of national GDP has consistently fallen from the 2006‚Äì2007 peak of 0.33% to 0.19% in 2011‚Äì2012. In defiance of the Supreme Court ruling of April 2011, the provincial assembly of Sindh Province passed the unprecedented Sindh Higher Commission Act in 2013 creating Pakistan's first provincial higher education commission. In October 2014, Punjab Province followed suit as part of a massive restructuring of its own higher education system. = Effect of reforms on student numbers and academic output = Despite the turbulence caused by the legal battle being waged since the 2011 constitutional amendment discussed above, the number of degree- awarding institutions continues to grow throughout the country, both in the private and public sectors. University student rolls have continued to rise, from 0.28 million in 2001 to 0.47 million in 2005 and more than 1.2 million in 2014. Just under half of universities are privately owned. Between 2002 and 2009, the HEC increased the number of PhD graduates to 6 000 per year and in provided up to 11 000 scholarships for study abroad. The number of Pakistani publications recorded in Thomson Reuter's Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded) leapt from 714 to 3 614 over the same period then to 6778 by 2014. This progress in scientific productivity appears to be due to the momentum generated by the larger numbers of faculty and student scholarships for study abroad, as well as the swelling ranks of PhD graduates. Critics argue that the rapid, massive increase in numbers has compromised quality, a claim supported by the stagnation of Pakistani universities in global education rankings by 2009. Challenges Pakistan has been known internationally for some of its major achievements in science and technology such as successful development of media and military technologies and a growing base of doctors and engineers, as well as its new influx of software engineers who have been actively contributing to Pakistan's potential in the Information Technology industry. Due to present situation in Pakistan, around 3,000 Pakistani doctors emigrate to Western economies in search of suitable employment opportunities and hence contribute intellectually to the health sector of developed countries and at the same time leaving the effects of a brain drain in Pakistan. Despite some progressive scientific achievements, Pervez Hoodbhoy published a report on scientific output in Pakistan in which he pointed out that research and scientific activities are significantly lower than many other developing countriesScience and the Islamic world‚ÄîThe quest for rapprochement, Pervez Hoodbhoy, Physics Today Hoodbhoy cites that Pakistan has produced fewer papers than neighboring India.[http://ptonline.aip.org/journals/doc/PHTOAD- ft/vol_60/iss_8/captions/49_1table1.shtml The seven most scientifically productive Islamic countries as of early 2007 compared against a selection of other countries, Philadelphia-based science information specialist, Thomson Scientific The contentions of Hoodbhoy have been strongly refuted by neutral international experts who have praised the tremendous increase in research output from Pakistan after the establishment of the Higher Education Commission in 2002,.https://ejournals.bc.edu/ojs/index.php/ihe/article/viewFile/8416/7550http://ww3.comsats.edu.pk/vcforum2013/Abstracts/Prof.%20Dr.%20Atta- ur-Rahman,%20FRS.pdf In a report published by Thomson Reuters in 2016, it has been concluded that the rate of increase of highly cited papers in international journals from Pakistan is higher than that from Brazil, Russia, India or China. Also, in November 2017, a Chinese study published in Scientometrics (journal) revealed that Pakistan's research growth rate and time required to double the number of publications is superior than that of USA, China and India.

Growing up in Los Angeles, he became acquainted with Hollywood session trumpeters. Many of these introductions came through John Rinaldo, his band director at Eagle Rock High School. Rinaldo's jazz program included others who went on to become professionals, such as drummers Carlos Vega and Sam Wiley, bassists Scott Colley and David Stone, guitarist Larry Koonse, saxophonists Doug Rinaldo, Brian Mitchell, and Gary Hypes, trombonists Arturo Velasco and Luis Bonilla, pianist Guy Steiner, and trumpeters Bobby Muzingo and Buddy Gordon. Through Rinaldo, Ingram was able to meet and study with Bobby Shew and Laroon Holt. Ingram's teachers included Bud Brisbois, Mannie Klein, Roy Stevens, Don Raffell, Bobby Findley, Carmine Caruso, Reynold Schilke, James Stamp, Uan Rasey, Mel Broiles, and Dan Jacobs. CareerEarly performing= At sixteen, Ingram toured with Louie Bellson, sharing section duties with Blue Mitchell, Bobby Shew, Cat Anderson, and Frank Szabo. His first international gigs were with that group during the 1974 Belvedere King Size Jazz Festival Tour at Varsity Stadium in Toronto, the Winnipeg Arena in Winnipeg, and the Pacific Coliseum in Vancouver, Canada. After his stint with Bellson, he graduated from high school and then joined Quincy Jones or a fall tour. After that tour, he spent a year touring with Connie Stevens, playing lead trumpet for the first time. At eighteen, Ingram played first trumpet with singer Tom Jones and toured with him for six years.Tom Jones, Over the Top and Back, 2015. After that, he moved to Las Vegas, where for two years he gained experience playing on the Las Vegas Strip. =With Woody Herman and Maynard Ferguson= In 1985, Ingram joined the Woody Herman Orchestra as lead trumpet. Ingram's friend Ron Stout held the jazz trumpet chair and helped get him in the band. He remained with the band until Herman's death in 1987. He recorded three Grammy-nominated albums with Herman: The 50th Anniversary Tour, Woody's Gold Star, and The Concord Years. He is the last lead trumpeter to play with the \\"original\\" Woody Herman Orchestra. Ingram returned to Los Angeles after Herman's death, founding and co-leading his big band with saxophonist Steve Elliott. The Ingram-Elliott big band featured Bobby Shew, Till Br√∂nner, Bill Watrous, and Gary Foster. In 1988, he worked with the WDR Jazz Orchestra in Cologne, Germany. While in Germany, he recorded works by Bob Brookmeyer and Jim McNeely with Mel Lewis on drums. During this time, he recorded with saxophonist Loren Schoenberg and pianist Django Bates. Later that year, Ingram joined the orchestra of Maynard Ferguson and recorded three albums with him. In October 2004, he performed as a featured artist at Stratospheric, a four-day festival honoring Ferguson. In September 2006, he performed as a featured soloist at the Maynard Ferguson Tribute Concert in St. Louis, Missouri, with many other trumpeters, including his long-time friend and colleague Wayne Bergeron.The Maynard Ferguson Tribute Concert Program, 2006. After three years as lead trumpeter for Ferguson, he moved to Florida, where he was a teaching assistant and private instructor at the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida. While in Miami, he collaborated with his friend and colleague, Cuban trumpeter Arturo Sandoval, recording the Grammy Award-winning album, Danzon.Liner notes from CD Danzon He also did commercial recording work, performed and toured with the New Xavier Cugat Orchestra, and worked on a consistent basis with the Peter Graves Orchestra. =With Harry Connick Jr. and Lincoln Center= In 1990, Ingram joined the newly formed big band of pianist Harry Connick Jr. He recorded three albums with Connick, working with him until the orchestra disbanded in 1993. The following year, he toured with singer Frank Sinatra. Later in 1994, he moved to New York City, joining Wynton Marsalis and his Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra. He recorded three albums with Marsalis, including the Pulitzer Prize‚Äìwinning Blood on the Fields. Ingram left Jazz at Lincoln Center in 1997 to tour and record with Ray Charles for two years. After touring with singer-songwriter Paul Anka, he joined the re-formed Harry Connick Jr. Bg Band in 1998 and recorded the Grammy nominated album Come by Me. In April 2000, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) gave that album a gold record certification. In the summer of 2001, he toured with the Count Basie Orchestra, returning to tour with Connick in November. Ingram has appeared on several of Connick's albums, including Blue Light, Red Light, When My Heart Finds Christmas, Songs I Heard, Harry for the Holidays, Thou Shalt Not, Chanson du Vieux Carre, Oh My NOLA, and What a Night! A Christmas Album. =Broadway and festivals= While living in New York, Ingram performed in a freelance capacity in more than twenty Broadway productions, including Chicago, Grease, Cats, Les Mis√©rables, and The Producers. In addition, he played trumpet for the Alvin Ailey Dance Theatre and was principal trumpeter in the Broadway shows and cast albums of Thou Shalt Not, The Pajama Game, and Harry on Broadway, Act 1. =Instrument design= In 2009, Ingram designed a B‚ô≠ trumpet for the Jupiter Band Instrument company. This trumpet is the XO Series 1600I model, known as the I-horn, and is the trumpet he uses exclusively. He also performs with the Jupiter XO Series professional flugelhorn and the Jupiter XO Series professional 4-valve B-flat/A piccolo trumpet (Jupiter 1700RS). For fun, he also plays the Jupiter 528L valve trombone. From 2011‚Äì2014, manufactured by Pickett Brass of Lexington Kentucky, Ingram's line of six professional mouthpieces for B-flat trumpet (the V-cup, the Lead, the Studio, the Jazz, the Be-Bop, and the Instant Chet) arrived on the market.

It is a NREM parasomnia.Inoue, Y. (2015). Sleep-related eating disorder and its associated conditions. Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences, 69(6), 309‚Äì320. It is described as being in a specific category within somnambulism or a state of sleepwalking that includes behaviors connected to a person's conscious wishes or wants. Thus many times NSRED is a person's fulfilling of their conscious wants that they suppress; however, this disorder is difficult to distinguish from other similar types of disorders. Comparison with night eating syndrome NSRED is closely related to night eating syndrome (NES) except for the fact that those suffering from NES are completely awake and aware of their eating and bingeing at night while those suffering from NSRED are sleeping and unaware of what they are doing. NES is primarily considered an eating disorder while NSRED is primarily considered a parasomnia; however, both are a combination of parasomnia and eating disorders since those suffering from NES usually have insomnia or difficulty sleeping and those suffering from NSRED experience symptoms similar to binge eating. Some even argue over whether NES and NSRED are the same or distinct disorders. Even though there have been debates over these two disorders, specialists have examined them to try to determine the differences. Dr. J. Winkelman noted several features of the two disorders that were similar, but he gave one important factor that make these disorders different. In his article \\"Sleep-Related Eating Disorder and Night Eating Syndrome: Sleep Disorders, Eating Disorders, Or both\\", Winkelman said, \\"Both [disorders] involve nearly nightly binging at multiple nocturnal awakenings, defined as excess calorie intake or loss of control over consumption.\\" He also reported that both disorders have a common occurrence of approximately one to five percent of adults, have been predominantly found in women, with a young adult onset, have a chronic course, have a primary morbidity of weight gain, sleep disruption, and shame over loss of control over food intake, have familial bases, and have been observed to have comorbid depression and daytime eating disorders. However, Winkelman said, \\"The most prominent cited distinction between NES and SRED is the level of consciousness during nighttime eating episodes.\\" Therefore, these two disorders are extremely similar with only one distinction between them. Doctors and psychologists have difficulty differentiating between NES and NSRED, but the distinction of a person's level of consciousness is what doctors chiefly rely on to make a diagnosis. One mistake that is often made is the misdiagnosis of NSRED for NES. However, even though NSRED is not a commonly known and diagnosed disease, many people suffer from it in differing ways while doctors work to find a treatment that works for everyone; several studies have been done on NSRED, such as the one conducted by Schenck and Mahowald. These studies, in turn, provide the basic information on this disorder including the symptoms, behaviors, and possible treatments that doctors are using today.  Signs and symptoms  Over the past 30 years, several studies have found that those afflicted with NSRED all have different symptoms and behaviors specific to them, yet they also all have similar characteristics that doctors and psychologists have identified to distinguish NSRED from other combinations of sleep and eating disorders such as night eating syndrome. Winkelman says that typical behaviors for patients with NSRED include: \\"Partial arousals from sleep, usually within 2 to 3 hours of sleep onset, and subsequent ingestion of food in a rapid or 'out of control' manner.\\" They also will attempt to eat bizarre amalgamations of foods and even potentially harmful substances such as glue, wood, or other toxic materials. In addition, Schenck and Mahowald noted that their patients mainly ate sweets, pastas, both hot and cold meals, improper substances such as \\"raw, frozen, or spoiled foods; salt or sugar sandwiches; buttered cigarettes; and odd mixtures prepared in a blender.\\" During the handling of this food, patients with NSRED distinguish themselves, as they are usually messy or harmful to themselves. Some eat their food with their bare hands while others attempt to eat it with utensils. This occasionally results in injuries to the person as well as other injuries. After completing their studies, Schenck and Mahowald said, \\"Injuries resulted from the careless cutting of food or opening of cans; consumption of scalding fluids (coffee) or solids (hot oatmeal); and frenzied running into walls, kitchen counters, and furniture.\\" A few of the more notable symptoms of this disorder include large amounts of weight gain over short periods of time, particularly in women; irritability during the day, due to lack of restful sleep; and vivid dreams at night. It is easily distinguished from regular sleepwalking by the typical behavioral sequence consisting of \\"rapid, 'automatic' arising from bed, and immediate entry into the kitchen.\\" In addition, throughout all of the studies done, doctors and psychiatrists discovered that these symptoms are invariant across weekdays, weekends, and vacations as well as the eating excursions being erratically spread throughout a sleep cycle. Most people that suffer from this disease retain no control over when they arise and consume food in their sleep. Although some have been able to restrain themselves from indulging in their unconscious appetites, some have not and must turn to alternative methods of stopping this disorder. It is important for trained physicians to recognize these symptoms in their patients as quickly as possible, so those with NSRED may be treated before they injure themselves.  Diagnosis  Criteria = The diagnostic criteria utilized by the International Classification of Sleep Disorders-Third Edition (ICSD-3) include some dysfunctional eating when the person wake up during the main sleep period, eating unusual or toxic food, negative health consequences. The patient could be injured during these episodes and he might not be conscious and won‚Äôt remember them.American Academy of Sleep Medicine (2014) International classification of sleep disorders, 3rd edn. American Academy of Sleep Medicine, Darien This criterion differentiates SRED from Night eating syndrome(NES). Patients with NES are conscious during the episode.Avidan, A. Y. (2017). Non‚ÄìRapid Eye Movement Parasomnias: Clinical Spectrum, Diagnostic Features, and Management. In Principles and Practice of Sleep Medicine (p. 981‚Äì992). Elsevier  Treatment  For those patients who have not been able to stop this disorder on their own, doctors have been working to discover a treatment that will work for everyone. One treatment that Schenck and Mahowald studied consisted of psychotherapy combined with \\"environmental manipulation\\". This was usually done separately from the weight-reducing diets. However, during this study only 10 percent of the patients were able to lose more than one third of their initial excess weight, which was not a viable percentage. In addition, they reported that many of the patients experienced \\"major depression\\" and \\"severe anxiety\\" during the attempted treatments. This was not one of the most successful attempts to help those with NSRED. However, Dr. R. Auger reported on another trial treatment where patients were treated utilizing pramipexole. Those conducting the treatment noticed how the nocturnal median motor activity was decreased, as was assessed by actigraphy, and individual progress of sleep quality was reported. Nevertheless, Augur also said, \\"27 percent of subjects had RLS (restless legs syndrome, a condition known to respond to this medication), and number and duration of waking episodes related to eating behaviors were unchanged.\\" Encouraged by the positive response verified in the above-mentioned trial treatment, doctors and psychiatrists conducted a more recent study described by Auger as \\"efficacy of topiramate [an antiepileptic drug associated with weight loss] in 17 consecutive patients with NSRED.\\" Out of the 65 percent of patients who continued to take the medication on a regular basis, all confirmed either considerable development or absolute remission of \\"night-eating\\" in addition to \\"significant weight loss\\" being achieved. This has been one of the most effective treatments discovered so far, but many patients still suffered from NSRED. Therefore, other treatments were sought after. Such treatments include those targeted to associated sleep disorders with the hope that it would play an essential part of the treatment process of NSRED. In Schenck and Mahowald's series, combinations of cardibopa/L-dopa, codeine, and clonazepam were used to treat five patients with RLS and one patient with somnambulism and PLMS (periodic limb movements in sleep). These patients all were suffering from NSRED as well as these other disorders, and they all experienced a remission of their NSRED as a result of taking these drugs. Two patients with OSA (obstructive sleep apnea) and NSRED also reported as having a \\"resolution of their symptoms with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) therapy.\\" Clonazepam monotherapy was also found to be successful in 50 percent of patients with simultaneous somnambulism. Dopaminergic agents such as monotherapy were effective in 25 percent of the NSRED subgroup. Success with combinations of dopaminergic and opioid drugs, with the occasional addition of sedatives, also was found in seven patients without associated sleep disorders. In those for whom opioids and sedatives are relatively contraindicated (e.g., in those with histories of substance abuse), two case reports were described as meeting with success with a combination of bupropion, levodopa, and trazodone. Notably, hypnotherapy, psychotherapy, and various behavioral techniques, including environmental manipulation, were not effective on the majority of the patients studied. Nevertheless, Auger argue that behavioral strategies should complement the overall treatment plan and should include deliberate placement of food to avoid indiscriminate wandering, maintenance of a safe sleep environment, and education regarding proper sleep hygiene and stress management. Even with their extensive studies, Schenck and Mahowald did not find the success as Auger found by treating his patients with topiramate.  History  The first case of NSRED was reported in 1955, but over the next 36 years, only nine more reports were made of this syndrome. Seven of these reports were single-case studies and the other two instances were seen during objective sleep studies, all done by psychiatrists and doctors. Schenck and Mahowald were the first to a major study on this disorder. They started their study of NSRED in 1985 and continued until 1993 with several cases among a total of 38 other various sleep-related disorders. Many of the cases they observed had symptoms that overlapped with those of NES, but this study was the first to discover that NSRED was different from NES in the fact that those suffering from NSRED were either partially or completely unaware of their actions at night while those with NES were aware. Schenck and Mahowald also discovered that none of the patients had any eating instability before their problems at night while sleeping. In their 1993 report, they summarized the major findings with the idea that women encompass at least two thirds of the patients and that the majority of these patients had become overweight. They also discovered that while the patients' night-eating normally started during early adulthood, this wasn't always the case as it started as early as childhood to as late as middle adulthood. These patients not only had NSRED, but many of them had also been suffering from other nighttime behaviors such as sleep terrors for several years. This revolutionized the way people saw NSRED. With the technological age growing and more people becoming obese, Schenck and Mahowald's discovery of NSRED causing a large weight increase helped doctors more easily identify this disorder. As seen in Table 1 below, almost half of Schenck and Mahowald's patients were significantly obese. According to body mass index's criteria, no patient was emaciated. Schenck and Mahowald said, \\"virtually all patients had accurate non-distorted appraisals of their body size, shape, and weight. Furthermore, unlike the patients in Stunkard's series, none of our patients had problematic eating in the evening between dinner and bedtime; sleep onset insomnia was not present; and sleep latency was usually brief, apart from several patients with RLS.\\" After realizing what was wrong with them, many of Schenck and Mahowald's patients with NSRED restricted their day eating and over exercised. This table summary identifies the first initial findings concerning NSRED, and it shows how NSRED is a random malady that affects many different types of people in individual ways.

Dr Kawashima's Brain Training) are three educational puzzle video games developed by Nintendo for the Nintendo DSi's DSiWare download service. They are the third series of games in the Brain Age series, and are repackaged versions of both Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day! and Brain Age 2: More Training in Minutes a Day! games, featuring both old and new puzzles. There are three editions: Arts & Letters, Math, and Sudoku. The Arts & Letters and Math versions were released on December 24, 2008 in Japan as launch titles for the DSiWare service, and the Sudoku edition on April 22, 2009 in Japan as well. The Math edition is the only version available outside Japan, and was released on April 5, 2009 in North America and June 19, 2009 in the PAL regions, as a launch title for the service. However, the Arts & Letters edition was released on August 10, 2009 in North America and October 23, 2009 in the PAL regions. The puzzles featured in both the Literature and Science editions were created by Ryuta Kawashima. One puzzle in each of these two editions utilizes the Nintendo DSi's camera function, while both versions allow players to use a photo for their in-game profile. On June 19, 2015, Brain Age Express: Sudoku was pulled from the DSi Shop and 3DS eShop, with no official reason given. Brain Age Express: Math and Brain Age Express: Arts & Letters are pre-installed on North American Nintendo DSis. Gameplay They use similar gameplay concepts to Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day! and Brain Age 2: More Training in Minutes a Day! titles; they both require the player to hold the DS on its side with the top screen on left and the touch screen on right (reverse in lefty mode). Like their predecessors, both versions feature modes called \\"Brain Age Check\\" and \\"Training\\". In Brain Age Check, where the game uses several training puzzles to test his or her brain age, with the ideal brain age for people 20 or over. Using the DSi's internal clock, both versions allow for only one official Brain Age Check per day. In Training, the player may freely play any game that is available, and is able to compare how well they did with previous days. Each title comes with three new training puzzles, as well as several puzzles taken from the previous Brain Age titles. Both editions include Virus Buster, also known as Germ Buster, a non-training puzzle based on the Dr. Mario series. =Brain Age Express: Arts & Letters= The Arts & Letters edition (Literature edition in Japan and Arts edition in PAL region) features word and memory puzzles. One new puzzle is called Photo Memory, a memory puzzle, where the game will take a picture from either the game itself or from the player's DSi, show it to the player, and then have the player pick between it and other randomly selected images from the player's folder while showing another image to memorize, and so on. For Brain Age Check, it uses Stroop Test, Connect Maze, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Word Memory, and Symbol Match. The Training mode features puzzles from previous games, these are Reading Aloud, Word Scramble and Piano Player. This game is not available in South Korea and China. =Brain Age Express: Math= One of the new puzzles available in the Science edition. On the left it shows a player doing math problems as people enter and exit the house; on the right it shows the end of the puzzle, where the player must write how many people are still in the house. This puzzle is called \\"Multi Tasker\\". The Math edition (Science edition in Japan) deals with numbers and math puzzles. The new puzzles included in this edition are Sum Totaled, By the Numbers, and Multi Tasker. The Brain Age Check includes High Number, Speed Counting, Serial Subtraction, Math Recall, and Number Memory. The Training include puzzles from previous games, like Calculations X20, Calculations X100, Triangle Math, and Change Maker. =Brain Age Express: Sudoku= The now- deleted Sudoku edition used to feature 100 sudoku puzzles divided in three difficulties: Basic, Medium and Advanced, instead of the Training mode featured on the other editions. It featured techniques for all the difficulties of the puzzles, explained by Dr. Kawashima. This edition also featured a Brain Age Check, with three puzzles: Number Memory, Connect Maze and High Number. This version, unlike the Math and Arts & Letters editions, did not use the DSi camera nor the microphone. For unknown reasons, it was retired on June 19, 2015 from both the DSi Shop and the 3DS eShop. Cosplayer of Brain Age Express: Sudoku title Development The two Brain Age Express titles were announced on October 2, 2008 at the reveal of the Nintendo DSi and its DSiWare service and were released on December 24, 2008. The titles were created to be played anywhere at any time. Nintendo chose the most popular puzzles from Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day! and Brain Age 2: More Training in Minutes a Day! to include in the two versions. At the launch of Nintendo DSi in the U.S., Brain Age Express: Math was released at the DSiWare launch while the Sudoku edition is available in Japan on April 22, 2009. This edition along the Literature edition was later released. The idea for Brain Age Express came from the Download Software Subcommittee meeting back when Nintendo was developing the Nintendo DSi as a console. During the subcommittee, members from a variety of teams came together to come up with small titles that could be downloaded from the Internet as part of a \\"My DS\\" brand. The meetings' progress was considerably slow, due to the nature of the Nintendo DSi being undetermined at that point. Several rough ideas were presented, but none stood out, and as a result, possible projects piled up, creating a bad situation. The problem was that none of the ideas were bad, and while they were fun to talk about, some were not very realistic. The Express series, known in PAL regions as the A Little Bit of... series and in Japan as the Chotto series, was proposed, but was unnoticed amongst other proposals. The name was conceived by Satoru Iwata, CEO of Nintendo, jokingly using the name \\"Chotto! Generations\\". He stated that while some may find a video game fun, they may also worry that it would be too time-consuming. The series was modelled after the nature of the Brain Age series, which allows for short play times. Due to complications between Shigeru Miyamoto, a key developer of Nintendo, and Iwata, the developers were having a difficult time getting started with Brain Age Express. In the end, it was decided that Chotto could mean a variety of things, which worked out well for everyone. Koichi Kawamoto, lead developer of Brain Age Express, stated that while the retail Brain Age games, after players collected a stamp for playing through a certain puzzle, they were returned to the stamp calendar. In this version, after collecting the stamp, the players are given the option of either returning to the main menu or to the DSi's menu. The developers wondered how much content could be included for this game to still be considered a Chotto title, as no particular size, standard, or guidelines had been set. When deciding what games to be included, Kawamoto wavered between simply selecting games from previous Brain Age titles or making new ones. When he was asked whether the number of games was enough, he responded by asking if they should push some new games in the fore, which he thought would be more fun for players. However, as they added, they added so many games that it was bigger than Brain Age 2. However, he couldn't remove any of the games, having taken a liking to them, thinking that plenty of variety was good. Shinya Takahashi, the coordinator of the DSiWare service, suggested splitting the title into two titles, which Kawamoto thought would be hard, but could be done. He suggested two versions - Math version and Arts and Letters version. Kawamoto flew to Sendai, Japan to ask Dr. Ryuta Kawashima, the inspiration for the Brain Age series, to ask if this would be all right. Kawashima gave him his assent, stating that a difference between players' brain ages may arise, and would help them determine whether they are more math- or art-oriented. The development staff had to consider what to carry over from the previous two Brain Age titles to the Brain Age Express titles. The Brain Age Express titles were a part of the \\"My DS\\" theme, which allows players to customize their Nintendo DSis, resulting in people naturally thinking that there would be only one save slot. They did not want to remove the element of communication, so they included the Guest mode. Normally, guests' data is not saved, but in the Brain Age Express titles, certain guest data, including their brain ages drawings, photos, and voices. A photo comparison game in the Arts and Letters version was described as simple yet difficult by Takahashi and Kawamoto. Two other games include Kanji Shooter and Sum Totaled, which belong to the Arts and Letters and Math versions respectively, involve defeating enemies by writing either kanji or numbers. These are alternate modes to games which are simply kanji- and number-based. They were included due to Kawamoto's love of video games, describing them both as having a \\"retro games\\" feel. When the player reaches a brain age of 20 in the Brain Age Express titles, it unlocks a challenge mode. This was in response to Kawashima's disappointment over people quitting once they reach 20 to keep people interested. Kawamoto considers these titles downloadable versions of the previous Brain Age titles rather than a sequel to them. Reception In their impressions of the Japanese release of the two original titles in the Brain Age Express series, IGN described the two titles as perfect showpieces for the DSiWare service, due to the eliminating cartridge swapping. Of what they've played, Nintendo has given it the polish that titles in a series that's sold more than ten million copies should, also complimenting them for feeling like full games despite the limited content. IGN editor Craig Harris gave the Math edition a 7.9 out of 10, praising it for feeling like almost as full of a game as the retail releases, comparing its $8.00 price tag to the retail games' $19.99 price tag. However, they found fault in the usage of many puzzles from the retail titles. Notes * a: The full Japanese title is .

Early years Unger was born in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii. He attended Hawaii Preparatory Academy in Kamuela, Hawaii, where he was a 2002 second-team all-state offensive honoree. Regarded as a three-star recruit by Rivals.com, Unger was listed as the No. 45 offensive guard. He chose to attend Oregon over Oregon State. Unger's grandfather, Tom E. Unger, wrote a book about his grandfather, Maximillian Joseph August Schlemmer, titled 'Max Schlemmer, Hawaii's King of Laysan Island.' College career Unger enrolled in the University of Oregon, where he played for the Oregon Ducks football team from 2005 to 2008. While playing for the Ducks, Unger was twice named as a first-team All-Pac-10 selection, and also receiving honorable mention and second-team All-Pac-10 honors. He was a first-team All-American in 2008 in recognition of his successful season. Unger started on the offensive line in all of his four years with the Ducks.

Fail (March 28, 1926February 26, 2010) was an American financial executive, the chairman of Stone Holdings, Inc. and Bluebonnet Savings Bank. A native of Mobile, Alabama, he attended Murphy High School and served for three years in the U.S. Navy. After graduating from the University of Alabama in 1949, he began his career as a securities salesman for Merrill Lynch. In the following decades, Fail and his holding companies have owned and operated a variety of investment, mortgage, banking, savings and loan, and insurance businesses throughout the U.S. Fail was thrust into public attention in 1990, when the Senate Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee held hearings scrutinizing his business activities, in particular his acquisition of a federally funded thrift despite a prior indictment for fraud and the criminal conviction of his company. More recently, he has been noted for a variety of philanthropic and community leadership efforts. Business history Fail became Vice President of Commercial Mortgage Company in 1961 and President of Gulf South Mortgage and Investment Company in 1964. He founded Lifeshares Group, an insurance holding company, in 1970. From 1987 to 1997 he was owner and chairman of The Oklahoma Bank. Fail was indicted for securities fraud in Alabama in 1976. As a result of a plea bargain, the charges against him personally were dropped; he pleaded guilty on behalf of his already-bankrupt company, and he was barred from doing any further business in Alabama. This incident would later provide the basis for further fraud charges against Fail brought by the FDIC. In 1988, during the savings and loan crisis, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board approved the Southwest Plan, a program to provide government assistance to induce private capital investors to bail out failed savings and loans in the southwestern United States. While owner of CFSB Corporation, now known as Stone Capital, Inc., Fail acquired one such package of 15 insolvent thrifts, the Pard/Rose package. These were merged into a single thrift and renamed Bluebonnet. As a result of regulatory changes in 1989, Fail has been pursuing a Winstar suit against the federal government for an amount on the order of $100 million, which was still running as of 2006. In order to buy Bluebonnet, in September 1988 Fail borrowed $34 million from Mutual Security Life Insurance Co., a Fort Wayne, Indiana company he had bought the previous year while it was struggling with debt. Mutual Security became insolvent in August 1990 and moved its headquarters to Lincoln, Nebraska and Dallas, Texas; its Indiana business was seized by state regulators, prompting BusinessWeek to describe 130,000 policyholders as \\"in limbo\\". Also in 1990, another of Fail's insurance companies, Farm and Home Life Insurance, failed and was placed in receivership by the Arizona Department of Insurance. In March 1992, Arizona sued Fail and his deputies for civil racketeering fraud in an amount in excess of the company's $101 million insolvency, alleging that \\"Mr. Fail and others were engaged in an elaborate scheme to drain millions of dollars out of the company...\\", resulting in its failure. The case was settled for $78.8 million. The Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights investigated the Bluebonnet deal in 1990 to determine, among other questions, why Fail's bid succeeded despite the 1976 fraud conviction of his company, which should have been a \\"presumptive disqualifier\\" per FHLBB regulations. Initially most of the criticism came from chairman Howard Metzenbaum, who described the deal as \\"an abomination, the worst case we have found\\" among the savings and loan bailouts. When Fail admitted to incorrect disclosures of his legal history, Senators Arlen Specter and Orrin Hatch also voiced their concerns. Author Marin Lowy, in his 1991 analysis of the situation, describes the hearings as exaggerated and \\"political hay\\". At the same time, Lowy expresses doubt towards Fail's \\"business morals\\" and trustworthiness with federal aid, concluding that thanks to the public scrutiny, \\"there's little likelihood that Mr. Fail can or will loot Bluebonnet\\", and in this sense the public good had ultimately been served. Bluebonnet maintained a profitable banking profile through 2003, when it opted to liquidate its assets. Philanthropy and community involvement Fail has served as a Director of the Beneficial Mortgage Company, a member of the Economic Club of New York and a founder of its Centennial Society, and a Director of the Phoenix Symphony. In 1997 he established The Patsy and Jim Fail Scholarship at Birmingham-Southern College for \\"any worthy and deserving student\\". In 2007 Fail donated $200,000 to the Mobile Symphony, endowing its principal cello chair in memory of his wife. Fail has repeatedly given to the Crimson Tide Foundation, the non-profit arm of the University of Alabama's athletic department. The department's media suite is named for Fail's father- in-law, Naylor Stone. In 2008, the visitor's locker room at Bryant‚ÄìDenny Stadium was officially named \\"The Fail Room\\" in his honor. Fail commented, \\"Earlier this year, when I saw the visitors' locker room as a potential naming right, I figured it was the most appropriate opportunity I would ever have to use my name.\\" Other donation recipients include the UAB School of Medicine, St. Paul's Academy, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the University of Alabama Collegiate Fund, the Alabama Symphony, and Kappa Sigma Beta.

Red Hills Area of Critical Environmental Concern The Red Hills provides a unique ecosystem in the area The Red Hills contain The Red Hills of Tuolumne County Area of Critical Environmental Concern, managed by the Bureau of Land Management as an Area of Critical Environmental Concern. The Red Hills Management Area consists of 7,100 acres (slightly more than 11 square miles) of public land located near the intersection of California State Route 49 and California State Route 120, just south of the historic town of Chinese Camp, California in Tuolumne County.http://www.blm.gov/ca/st/en/fo/folsom/redhillshomepg1.html . accessed 6/22/2010 . BLM public domain sourced The entire Red Hills Management Area has been designated as an Area of Critical Environmental Concern. The purpose of the designation is to protect the rare plant species found there, the unusual serpentine soils that provide habitat for unique flora of the area, habitat for the rare minnow known as the Red Hills roach and to protect bald eagle wintering habitat. Geology The Red Hills Management Area is located within the western tectonic block of the Sierra Nevada metamorphic belt. Within this block are Upper Jurassic volcanic and sedimentary rocks of island arc derivation which were highly deformed and weakly metamorphosed during the Nevada orogeny. These rocks were then intruded by plutons associated with the emplacement of the Sierra Nevada batholith, east of the metamorphic belt. The Management Area includes much of the Tuolumne ultramafic complex, one of the largest exposures of serpentine rocks in the Sierra Nevada metamorphic belt. Nearly the entire area is underlain by dunite, a variety of peridotite consisting of dark green olivine and minor chromite, which has been partly or entirely serpentinized to antigorite magnesite-magnetite. The dunite intruded into andesite pillow breccias and flows of the Pe√±on Blanco volcanic formation, which crops out near the northeast and southern boundaries of the Management Area. The intrusion of ultramafic material occurred along crustal weaknesses associated with the Bear Mountain fault, a northwestward trending thrust fault that dips steeply to the northeast, and has over 10,000 feet of vertical displacement. The fault zone is on the southwestern boundary of the Management Area, and is believed to have once penetrated the earth's crust down to the mantle, a probable source of the peridotite. Other geologic features of the area include northeastward trending dikes that consists of massive, dark brown, hornblende-plagioclase diorite which intruded into the dunite bedrock. A swarm of several dikes occurs in the southeast portion of the Management Area. Some of the dikes exceed one mile in length. Amphibolite and chert tectonic blocks also occur in the dunite near the area's southern and western boundaries. Tertiary and Pleistocene alluvium consisting of sand, gravel, pebbles, and cobbles has accumulated in Six Bit and Poor Man's Gulches in the northern and eastern portions of the Management Area. Flora The Red Hills area is host to shrubs, perennial grasses, and wildflowers The Red Hills are vegetated mostly by a foothill pine-buckbrush chaparral/woodland. Virtually the only tree species in the Red Hills is Foothill pine (Pinus sabiniana), which is found throughout the Red Hills in low densities. Buckbrush (Ceanothus cuneatus) comprises a majority of the shrub cover. Other shrubs include Toyon (Heteromeles arbutifolia), Coffee berry (Rhamnus californica tomentella), Chamise (Adenostoma fasciculatum), Hollyleaf redberry (Rhamnus crocea ilicifolia), California yerba santa (Eriodictyon californicum), and Manzanitas (Arctostaphylos spp.). Native perennials constitute a large percentage of the grass cover in the Red Hills. This is in contrast to similar elevations in the foothills, without serpentine substrates, where native perennials have been mostly replaced by exotic annuals. Important native perennial species include California oniongrass (Melica californica), Big squirreltail grass (Sitanion jubatum) and Pine bluegrass (Poa secunda). Disturbed areas, including burned areas, have a typical array of Mediterranean annual grasses. Herbaceous plants provide a spectacular wildflower bloom in the spring that attracts tourists, amateur naturalists, and classes from educational institutions. Although most of the species comprising the display are widespread on and off serpentine, some (in addition to the rare species discussed below) are strict serpentine endemics (e.g., Streptanthus polygaloides). = Sensitive plants = California verbena in bloom California verbena is endemic to the Red Hills Sensitive plants: Five plants which occur on the public lands of the Red Hills are considered sensitive species by BLM due to their rarity. Two of the plants have been proposed for listing under the Endangered Species Act indicating that the United States Fish and Wildlife Service feels it has accumulated sufficient evidence to list these species. These plants are the California verbena (Verbena californica), Rawhide Hill onion (Allium tuolumnense). A third plant species, Layne's butterweed (Senecio layneae), has already been listed as a threatened species. *California verbena is a Red Hills endemic, meaning it is found nowhere else in the world. Its distribution in the Red Hills is confined to the short stream reaches that remain moist year round because of ground water seepage. *The Rawhide Hill onion has many, mostly small, colonies in the Red Hills. Rawhide Hill onion is confined to areas with sparse vegetation, south facing slopes with shallow soils, and intermittent drainages. *Layne's butterweed is the only federally listed plant species in the Red Hills at this time. There are only a few very small occurrences of this member of the sunflower family in the Red Hills. Here as elsewhere, this species is often associated with disturbances like roadcuts. Senecio layneae is also found in El Dorado County on serpentine and gabbro. Two plants that had been designated as federal candidate category 2 species were eliminated from the list of candidate species when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service changed its rules for the inclusion of species as candidates in 1996. Congdon's lomatium (Lomatium congdonii) and the Red Hills soaproot (Chlorogalum grandiflorum) are locally common throughout the Red Hills favoring north slopes and ridgetops respectively. Congdon's lomatium is only known from the Red Hills and the Peoria Valley area. Red Hills soaproot is also found in El Dorado County, California on serpentine and gabbro. An additional species proposed for federal listing occurs on private lands just west of Chinese Camp and within a mile of the public land. Chinese Camp brodiaea (Brodiaea pallida) grows near a low gradient drainage in soils that remain wet late into the growing season. This species has not been located on the public lands of the Red Hills. Another plant, Hoover's butterweed (Senecio clevelandii var. heterophyllus) has been included on the California Native Plant Society's Watch List. It grows with the California verbena in riparian zones. It may be recognized as a separate taxon that is endemic to the Red Hills, or it may be included as a single taxon with plants found in the Coast Ranges. Fauna In the Red Hills buckbrush and other shrubs provide browse and seeds for small populations of mammals, including mule deer, jackrabbits, rodents. Coyotes, bobcats and fox can also be found in the Red Hills. 88 bird species have been observed in the Red Hills. Some common species include mourning dove, acorn woodpecker, ash- throated flycatcher, scrub jay, wrentit, plain titmouse, bushtit, Bewick's wren, and house finch. Valley quail and mourning doves are the major game birds in the Red Hills. An abundant insect population supports insectivorous birds including western kingbirds, ash- throated flycatcher, tree swallows, barn swallows, black phoebes, and others. Raptors include the red-tailed hawk, Cooper's hawk, prairie falcon, and great horned owl. Fish-eating birds seen in the Red Hills include the belted kingfisher and great blue heron. Roadrunners can also be found. Reptiles and amphibians are rarely observed in the Red Hills but two rare species are represented (see below). Fish in the Red Hills, found in Six Bit Gulch and Poor Man's Creek, include the green sunfish, large- mouth bass, Sacramento sucker, and the mosquito fish. These fish are predators or competitors with the Red Hills roach, a rare taxon of Minnow (discussed below). The presence of these mostly introduced species may limit the roach population. Rare fauna: Four sensitive species of animals are known from the Red Hills. Wintering bald eagles roost along the shores of Don Pedro Reservoir and have been observed where Six Bit Gulch enters the lake. As many as 20 bald eagles have been sighted during the winter on the shores of Don Pedro Reservoir, roosting in stands of foothill pines. Although the Red Hills has no perennial streams, it has a number of intermittent streams that have spring fed reaches and pools. Two sensitive riparian animal species are associated with these areas, Hesperoleucus symmetricus (California roach, a minnow; the distinctive Red Hills population has been called the Red Hills roach) and Rana boylii (foothill yellow legged frog). The Red Hills roach is found in abundance in several pools of permanent water located along the intermittent streams which drain into Six Bit Gulch and Poor Man's Gulch. It is thought that the permanent pools are spring-fed. During the dry part of the year the fish are confined to these permanent pools surviving in warm shallow water until spring when they move upstream to spawn. A recent study by ichthyologists at the University of California, Davis, and the California Department of Fish and Game has indicated that the Red Hills variety of California roach has unique morphologic characteristics, which make them noticeably different from other roach populations, notably a chisel lip. The chisel lip is used to scrape algae, a major food source, off submerged rocks. The foothill yellow-legged frog has been found in the western portion of the Red Hills in the Andrews Creek drainage. The western pond turtle has been found in the eastern portion of the Red Hills in Poor Man's Gulch. Both are rare species, formerly candidates for federal listing. Gold Placer gold occurs in stream channel deposits within the natural area, primarily Six Bit Gulch and Poor Man's Gulch, mostly washed in from the north.. The placer gold produced from this district was recovered by ground sluicing and hydraulic mining in earlier years, and by dragline dredging in the 1930s and 1940s. In the 1850s, during the great California Gold Rush, Chinese laborers, with their legendary patience and thoroughness, mined much of the placer gold within Six Bit Gulch, a major drainage channel that courses through the natural area. The dredging of Six Bit Gulch and Poor Man's Gulch produced over $100,000 worth of gold.

It combines behavior genetics, psychology, and political science and it is closely related to the emerging fields of neuropolitics (the study of the neural basis of political attitudes and behavior) and political physiology (the study of biophysical correlates of political attitudes and behavior). In 2008, The Chronicle of Higher Education reported on the increase in academicians' recognition of and engagement in genopolitics as a discrete field of study, and New York Times Magazine included genopolitics in its \\"Eighth Annual Year in Ideas\\" for the same year, noting that the term was originally coined by James Fowler. Critics of genopolitics have argued that it is \\"a fundamentally misguided undertaking\\", and that it is inconsistent with evidence in the fields of genetics, neuroscience, and evolutionary psychology. Twin studies of political attitudes Psychologists and behavior geneticists began using twin studies in the 1980s to study variation in social attitudes, and these studies suggested that both genes and environment played a role. In particular, Nick Martin and his colleagues published an influential twin study of social attitudes in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 1986. However, this early work did not specifically analyze whether or not political orientations were heritable, and political scientists remained mostly unaware of the heritability of social attitudes until 2005. In that year, the American Political Science Review published a reanalysis of political questions on Martin's social attitude survey of twins in that the suggested liberal and conservative ideology is heritable. The article sparked considerable debate between critics, the authors and their defenders. Twin studies of political behavior Initial twin studies suggested that predispositions toward espousal of certain political ideas are heritable, but they said little about political behavior (patterns of voting and/or activism) or predispositions toward it. A 2008 article published in the American Political Science Review matched publicly available voter registration records to a twin registry in Los Angeles, analyzed self-reported voter turnout in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), and studied other forms of political participation. In all three cases, both genes and environment contributed significantly to variation in political behavior. Additional studies showed that genes did not play a direct role in the choice of a political party, supporting a core finding in the study of American politics that the choice to be a Democrat or a Republican is largely shaped by parental socialization. However, other studies showed that the decision to affiliate with any political party and the strength of this attachment are significantly influenced by genes. Gene association studiesCandidate genes= Scholars therefore recently turned their attention to specific genes that might be associated with political behaviors and attitudes. In the first- ever research to link specific genes to political phenotypes, a direct association was established between voter turnout and monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) and a gene‚Äìenvironment interaction between turnout and the serotonin transporter (5HTT) gene among those who frequently participated in religious activities. In other research scholars have also found an association between voter turnout and a dopamine receptor (DRD2) gene that is mediated by a significant association between that gene and the tendency to affiliate with a political party. More recent studies show an interaction between friendships and the dopamine receptor (DRD4) gene that is associated with political ideology. Although this work is preliminary and needs replication, it suggests that neurotransmitter function has an important effect on political behavior. The candidate genes approach to genopolitics received substantial criticism in a 2012 article, published in the American Political Science Review, which argued that many of the candidate genes identified in the above research are associated with innumerable traits and behaviors. The degree to which these genes are associated with so many outcomes thus undermines the apparent important of evidence linking a gene to any particular outcome.Charney, Evan, and English, William. (2012). Candidate Genes and Political Behavior. American Political Science Review 106(1):1-34. =Linkage analysis= Employing a more general approach, researchers used genome-wide linkage analysis to identify chromosomal regions associated with political attitudes assessed using scores on a liberalism-conservativism scale. Their analysis identified several significant linkage peaks and the associated chromosomal regions implicate a possible role for NMDA and glutamate related receptors in forming political attitudes. However, this role is speculative as linkage analysis cannot identify the effect of individual genes. =Other explanations= Associations between genetic markers and political behavior are often assumed to predict a causal connection between the two. Scholars have little incentive to be skeptical of this presumed causal link. Yet it is possible that a confounding factor exists which makes the genetic relationship with politics purely correlative. For instance work on Irish parties, which shows some evidence of a genetic basis for the otherwise inexplicable distinction between the historically two main parties there, is also and more easily explained by socialization.

Occurrence  Pancratistatin occurs naturally in Hawaiian spider lily, a flowering plant within the family Amaryllidaceae. Pancratistatin is mostly found in the bulb tissues of spider lilies. It has been shown that the enrichment of atmospheric CO2 can enhance the production of antiviral secondary metabolites, including Pancratistatin, in these plants.Ziska, L.; Emche, S.; Johnson, E. Alterations in the production and concentration of selected alkaloids as a function of rising atmospheric carbon dioxide and air temperature: implications for ethno- pharmacology. Global Change Biology 2005, 11, 1798-1807 Pancratistatin can be isolated from the tropical bulbs of Hymenocallis littoralis in the order of 100 to 150 mg/kg when bulbs are obtained from the wild type in Hawaii. However, the compound has to be commercially extracted from field- and greenhouse-grown bulbs or from tissue cultures cultivated, for example, in Arizona, which generate lower levels of Pancratistatin (a maximum of 22 mg/kg) even in the peak month of October. After October, when the bulb becomes dormant, levels of Pancratistatin drop, down to only 4 mg/kg by May. Field- grown bulbs, which show monthly changes in Pancratistatin content, generate somewhat smaller amounts (2‚Äì5 mg/kg) compared to those grown in greenhouses cultivated over the same period.Ingrassia, L.; Lefranc, F.; Mathieu, V.; Darro, F.; Kiss, R. Amaryllidaceae isocarbostyril alkaloids and their derivatives as promising antitumor agents. Transl. Oncol. 2008, 1, 1-13. There are about 40 different spider lily species worldwide and they are mainly native to the Andes of South America. Schoals Spider Lilly Spider lily  Pharmaceutical research  Pancratistatin is thought to have potential as a basis for the development of new pharmaceuticals, particularly in the field of cancer treatment. Biosynthesis Although there may not be a precise elucidation of Pancratistatin biological synthesis, there have been speculations on biosynthesis of Narciclasine and Lycoricidine that are very similar to Pancratistatin in terms of structure. The biosynthesis is accomplished via synthesis from O-methylnorbelladine 4 by para-para phenol coupling to obtain vittatine 5 as an intermediate. Subsequent elimination of two carbon atoms and hydroxylations of compound 5 (vittatine) then leads to narciclasine.Fuganti, C; Staunton, J; Battersby, AR. The biosynthesis of narciclasine. J. Chem. Soc. D: Chem. Commun. 1971, 19, 1154‚Äì1155. Pancratistatin-like biosynthesis using Narciclasine as a model. Total synthesis The first total synthesis of racemic (+/-) Pancratistatin was proposed by Samuel Danishefsky and Joung Yon Lee, which involved a very complex and long (40 steps) total synthesis. According to both Danishefsky and Joung, there were several weak steps in this synthesis that gave rise to a disappointing low synthetic yield. Amongst the most challenging issues, the Moffatt transposition and the orthoamide problem, which required a blocking manoeuvre to regiospecifically distinguish the C, hydroxyl group for rearrangement were considered to be the severe cases. However, both Danishevsky and Yon Lee stated that their approach towards the PST total synthesis was not without merit and believed that their work would interest other medicinal scientists to construct a much more practical and efficient way for PST total synthesis.anishefsky, S.; Lee, J. Y. Total synthesis of (B1)-pancratistatin. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989, 111, 4829-37.Li, M; Wu, A; Zhou, P. A concise synthesis of (+)-pancratistatin using pinitol as a chiral building block. Tetrahedron Lett. 2006, 47, 3707‚Äì3710. The work of Danishevsky and Joung provided the foundation for another total synthesis of PST, which was propounded by Li, M. in 2006. This method employed a more sophisticated approach, starting out with the pinitol 30 that its stereocenters are exactly the same as the ones in the C-ring of Pancratistatin.Kim, S.; Ko, H.; Kim, E.; Kim, D. Stereocontrolled total synthesis of pancratistatin. Org. Lett. 2002, 4, 1343-5. Protection of the diol functions of compound 30 gave compound 31. The free hydroxyl of this was subsequently substituted by an azide to give 32. After removal of the silyl function, a cyclic sulfate was installed to obtain product 33. The Staudinger reaction gave the free amine 34 from azide 33. The coupling reaction between 34 and 35 gave compound 36 with a moderate yield. Methoxymethyl protection of both the amide and the free phenol gave compound 37. Treatment of this latter product with t-BuLi followed by addition of cerium chloride gave compound 38. Full deprotection of 38 by BBr3 and methanol afforded pancratistatin 3 in 12 steps from commercially available pinitol with an overall yield of 2.3% 20.Image gallery: a: TIPDSCl2, imidazole, DMAP, DMF, 24%. b: DMP, p-TsOH, acetone, 81%. c: PPh3, DEAD, CH3SO3H, CH2Cl2, 0 ¬∞C to r.t. then NaN3, DMF, 60 ¬∞C, 72%. d: TBAF, THF, 0 ¬∞C to r.t., 100%. e: SOCl2, Et3N, CH2Cl2, 0 ¬∞C. f: NaIO4, RuCl3, aq CH3CN, 87% (more than two steps). g: PPh3, aq THF, 0 ¬∞C to r.t., 94%. h: Et2O, 35, 0 ¬∞C, 64%. i: K2CO3, MOMCl, DMF, 84%. j: t-BuLi, CeCl3, ultrasound, THF, ‚àí78 ¬∞C to r.t., 72%. k: BBr3, CH2Cl2, ‚àí78 ¬∞C to 0 ¬∞C, 1 hour then MeOH, ‚àí78 ¬∞C to 0 ¬∞C, 2 hours, 52%.

The key step of this synthesis was the Nickel catalyzed dearomatization of benzene which directly installed the amine and catachol ring in 98:2 er. Epoxidation then dihydroxylation of the resulting diene afforded the 4 hydroxyl groups. The synthesis was completed by deprotection of the amine and a Cobalt catalzyed CO insertion to furnish the lactam. (+)-7deoxypancratistatin can then be directly oxidized in a 62% yield to give (+)-Pancratistatin. This synthesis yielded multiple grams of the final product which may be essential in the biological evaluation of Pancratistatin and analogues. A very recent approach to a stereocontrolled Pancratistatin synthesis was accomplished by Sanghee Kim from the National University of Seoul, in which Claisen rearrangement of dihydropyranethlyene and a cyclic sulfate elimination reaction were employed 21. The B ring of the phenanthridone (three membered nitrogen heterocyclic ring) is formed using the Bischler-Napieralski reaction. The n precursor 3 with its stereocenters in the C ring is stereoselectively synthesized from the cis-disubstituted cyclohexene 4. The presence of unsaturated carbonyl in compound 4 suggested the use of a Claisen rearrangement of 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyranylethylene.Shin, K. J.; Moon, H. R.; George, C.; Marquez, V. E. J. Org. Chem. 2000, 65, 2172. The synthesis starts with the treatment of 6 with excess trimethyl phosphate. This reaction provides phosphate 7 in 97% yield. Using the Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction between 7 and acrolein dimmer 8 in the presence of LHMDS in THF forms (E)-olefin 5 with very high stereoselectivity in 60% yield. Only less than 1% of (Z)-olefin was detected in the final product. The Claisen rearrangement of dihydropyranethylene forms the cis-distributed cyclohexene as a single isomer in 78% yield. The next step of the synthesis involves the oxidation of aldehyde of compound 4 using NaClO2 to the corresponding carboxylic acid 9 in 90% yield. Iodolactonization of 9 and subsequent treatment with DBU in refluxing benzene gives rise to the bicyclic lacytone in 78% yield. Methanolysis of lactone 10 with NaOMe forms a mixture of hydroxyl ester 11 and its C-4a epimer (Pancratistatin numbering). Saponification of the methyl ester 11 with LiOH was followed by a Curtius rearrangement of the resulting acid 12 with diphenylphosphoryl azide in refluxing toluene to afford an isocyanate intermediate, treatment of which with NaOMe/MeOH forms the corresponding carbamate 13 in 82% yield. The next steps of the synthesis involve the regioselective elimination of the C-3 hydroxyl group and subsequent unsaturation achieved by cyclic sulfate elimination. Diol 16 needs to be treated with thionyl chloride and further oxidation with RuCl3 provides the cyclic sulfate 17 in 83% yield.Winkler, J. D.; Kim, S.; Harrison, S.; Lewin, N. E.; Blumberg, P. M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999, 121, 296. Treatment of cyclic sulfate with DBU yields the desired allylic alcohol 18 (67% yield). Reaction with OsO4 forms the single isomer 19 in 88% yield. Peracetylation of 19 (77% yield) accompanied by Banwell‚Äôs modified Bischler-Napieralski reaction forms the compound 20 with a small amount of isomer 21 ( 7:1 regioselectivity). The removal of protecting groups with NaOMe/MeOH forms Pancratistatin in 83%.

The high point of the range is .Arizona Atlas and Gazetteer, 5th Ed. c. 2002, p. 46. Riverside Mountains Wilderness The Riverside Mountains Wilderness was established in 1994 and is managed by the Bureau of Land Management. The Colorado River parallels this 24,004 acre wilderness on its eastern edge. The landscape varies from gently sloping bajadas to steep, rugged interiors. Washes emerging from canyons divide the bajadas below. Numerous peaks in the Riverside Mountains give this small range a rough, craggy appearance. Two sensitive plant species, the foxtail cactus and California barrel cactus; and a small herd of Burro deer (Odocoileus hemionus eremicus) live in the Riverside range.Riverside Mountains Wilderness - BLM Geology Maria Fold and Thrust Belt = The Riverside Mountains are one of several ranges that constitute the Maria Fold and Thrust Belt (MFTB). The Maria Fold and Thrust Belt underwent generally thick-skinned (involving basement rocks) north‚Äìsouth-trending crustal shortening in the Cretaceous. The structures of the MFTB are exposed by to later generally east‚Äìwest-trending large-scale crustal extension in the Miocene, through what is known to geologists as the Colorado River Extensional Corridor. This north‚Äìsouth shortening is anomalous, as crustal shortening in the rest of the North American Cordillera is oriented generally east‚Äìwest because of the generally east‚Äìwest compression that was due to the subduction of the Farallon plate under western North America. Also unlike the rest of the North American Cordillera, deformation in the Maria Fold and Thrust Belt involved rocks of the North American Craton, most notably the Grand Canyon sequence of sedimentary rocks. = Rocks = The Riverside Mountains contain rocks from both the lower and upper plates of a large detachment fault and metamorphic core complex system as a result of the Miocene-age extension. The lower plate consists of a stack of metamorphosed units, which comprise Jurassic metavolcanics, the metamorphosed Grand Canyon sequence, the metamorphosed McCoy Mountains Formation and related Mesozoic rocks, and the Precambrian basement. The upper plate of the detachment fault consists of a small sedimentary basin containing Tertiary-age syntectonic (deposited during tectonic activity) volcanic units, conglomerates, and other sedimentary rocks.

The type species is C. violetae. A single fossil of an individual was found in the Santana Formation in Brazil, an 80-million-year-old Late Cretaceous deposit that has so far preserved other fossil reptiles such as dinosaurs and crocodilians.  Etymology  The genus was named for the city of Santana do Cariri where the fossil was unearthed. The species' specific name, violetae, honors Violeta Arraes, a former dean at the nearby Universidade Regional do Cariri. Arraes was a prominent local political figure during the 20th century and became instrumental in the development of paleontological studies in the area when she was appointed dean of the Universidade Regional do Cariri in 1997.  Description  Because the few remains used to describe the species were incomplete, anatomical characteristics used to differentiate Caririemys from other extinct and extant pleurodirans are derived mostly from the arrangement of the bony plates that form its domed carapace. The genus and species were first described in 2007, from the fragmentary remains of a single fossil specimen unearthed in north- eastern Brazil two years prior to the publication of the description. The Santana Formation of Brazil where the specimen was discovered is a treasure- trove of prehistoric turtle remains including the early sea turtle Santanachelys. Caririemys was the fifth unique testudine genus to have been described from fossils found in the Romualdo Member section of the geologic formation. The lone specimen, officially labeled as MN6919-v now resides in the Museu Nacional da Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro. The turtle skeleton found consisted of parts of the turtle's carapace, a few vertebral elements and a matching femur and pelvis. Since most of the elements used to systematically classify a fossil turtle in the Pleurodira (such as the skull) were missing, the species‚Äô affiliation was determined by the attachment of the specimen's pelvis to its carapace. Closer approximation and analysis of its carapace elements have shown that Caririemys is closely related to the turtle Euraxemys essweini from the same geographic locality and strata.

It is one of the most elaborate examples in Catalonia of an image of Christ on the Cross symbolizing his triumph over death.  History  The Batll√≥ Majesty is a 12th-century Romanesque polychrome wood carving now in the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya in Barcelona, Catalonia. The Batll√≥ Majesty is one of the finest and best-preserved examples of these Catalan sculptures. Carved wooden images were a fundamental element in churches as objects of worship. One of the most elaborate types in Catalonia was the Christ in Majesty, images of Christ on the Cross that symbolize his triumph over death, of which the most outstanding is the Batll√≥ Majesty. The frontal geometric composition of the tunic decorated in circles and floral motifs is reminiscent of the refined Byzantine and Hispano-Moorish fabrics held in such high esteem in the Christian West during this time. The great reference for this type was the Volto Santo in Lucca (Tuscany, Italy), which was regarded as having miraculous origins and was the object of pilgrimage and extraordinary devotion from the end of the eleventh century.Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya Online Collections At the end of the 11th century wood sculpture flourished in Catalonia. Carvers used four main formats to represent the Crucifixion: # 'Calvaries' where Jesus is represented on the cross with Mary and Joseph. # 'Deposition Tableaux', or figures of the good and bad thieves Mary Magdalene, John the Apostle, Nicodemus, and Joseph of Arimathea # 'Majestats' where large wooden crucifixes showed a triumphant Christ wearing a colobium (a long sleeveless tunic). # 'Nude Majestats' where Christ is wearing only a perizonium (loincloth).Mann, Janice. \\"A Monumental Catalan Crucifix\\", Bulletin of the Detroit Institute of Arts, Detroit. 1997, LXXI, 1-2, p.52, fig.9. Wood carving workshops were still active in the 12th century in the western part of the region in the high valleys of the Pyrenees in Catalonia. There are over thirty examples of these large crucifixes, called majestats.Mann, Janice. \\"Majestat Batll√≥\\", The Art of Medieval Spain, a.d.500-1200, New York, 1993, p.322-324. The Batll√≥ Majesty has been linked to the region of Olot near Girona. As with much medieval art, its creator is unknown, although a medieval legend credits Nicodemus with producing the sculpture soon after the actual Crucifixion, a pious tradition repeated elsewhere in Europe in connection with similar monumental crosses, like the better known Volto Santo in the church of San Martino, Lucca, to which they bear a notable similarity in appearance and date, these Catalan crucifixes were believed to have miraculous powers.Gertrud Schiller, Iconography of Christian Art. Volume 2. The Passion of Jesus Christ. Janet Seligman (tr.), Greenwich, CT: New York Graphic Society, 1972: 144-5, 472-3. A large number of majestats still exist from the Catalan provinces of Girona, Barcelona and Lleida, and the French province of Roussillon, such that some scholars believe these are monumental crosses once hung in almost every Romanesque church built in these regions as rood crosses.Mann, Janice. \\"Majestat Batll√≥\\", The Art of Medieval Spain, a.d.500-1200, New York, 1993, p.322-324. It is possible that the Majestats were the focus of an important and popular cult veneration in these regions as early as the tenth century. They were normally hung near portals of the churches or altars dedicated to the Savior. Often the backs of the majestats were painted with the Agnus Dei and the Evangelist's symbols suggesting that these crosses were also carried in processions.Mann, Janice. \\"Majestat Batll√≥\\", The Art of Medieval Spain, a.d.500-1200, New York, 1993, p.322-324. Probably it comes from a church in the district of Garrotxa (Girona). It entered the museum's collection donated by Enric Batll√≥ to the Province of Barcelona on a permanent loan, 1914. Its inventory Number is 015937-000.  Description  Detail of the corpus The cross was procured for the museum in 1914 by the collector Enric Batll√≥, for whom the piece is now named. It was also the same family that commissioned the construction of Casa Batll√≥ in 1877 Barcelona, Catalonia. At the time of its first arrival at the museum, it was covered with a thick coating of varnish that obscured but helped preserve its bright colors, which have now been restored.Trens, M., (1966) Les majestats catalanes, ( Monumenta Cataloniae, XIII) Barcelona p. 161 Recent studies have revealed the pigments used to produce the colors: the red from cinnabar and the blue from lapis lazuli. Both pigments were very expensive and the sculpture is believed to have come from a studio of some importance perhaps the studio around the monastery of Ripoll.Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya Online Collections  Iconography  The Batll√≥ Majesty presents Christ bearing his suffering with noble stoicism. It is a triumphant Christ wearing a colobium, or a long, sleeveless tunic. Although the corners of his mouth turn slightly downward, Christ's open eyes and unfurrowed brow create the impression of a self-possessed impassivity. One of the striking features of the Batll√≥ Majesty compared to others, is the well-conserved polychromy. Christ‚Äôs colobium, in imitation of rich oriental silk, is decorated with blue floral designs surrounded by circular red frames embellished with dots and circles. A thin belt with an elaborate interlace knot pulls the tunic in above Christ‚Äôs hips, making the fabric above it swell out slightly and curving the path of its flat, wide vertical folds. Such robes, called colobiums are linked with royal and priestly functions and provide a message of strength to the viewing audience. They can be seen as a visualization of image of the Apocalyptic Christ from the Book of Revelation.Schiller, Gertrud, Iconography of Cristian Art, Volume II, (1972) London, , pp.144-145 The iconographic tradition of Jesus in a colobium dates to 586 in a manuscript of the Syriac Gospels called the Rabbula Gospels, written by the monk Rabbula somewhere in Mesopotamia. It is thought that the tradition of depicting Christ in such costume was brought to Catalonia by artisans from Pisa who arrived in 1114 to help Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona in his conquest of the Balearic Islands.PIJO√ÅN, Jos√©, (1927), Historia general del arte, Volumen IX, colecci√≥n Summa Artis. El arte rom√°nico siglos XI y XII, p. 505 A Latin inscription above his head reads, \\"JHS NAZARENUS REX IUDEORUM\\" (\\"Jesus of Nazareth King of the Jews‚Äù) as in biblical accounts (Matthew 27:37, Mark 15:26, Luke 23:38, John 19:19).  Chronology  The chronology of the Batll√≥ Majesty is difficult to date, but the inscription on the cross and the painting could be placed in the eleventh century, although other authors dating back to the twelfth century based on the painting‚Äôs similarity to ones seen in the area of Ripoll, mid-twelfth century, which is used as an argument to support this dating, and can now be placed into 1150. The tunic also has an analogy with an Islamic motif abacus of the cloister of the abbey of Saint-Pierre de Moissac, which seems to prove the spread during the Romanesque period.

It was first marketed by Sch√§rfe System GmbH in 1987 under the name CASY1. The first systems were sold with an ATARI computer and a rectangular chassis. In the 1990s the ATARI computer got replaced by a common PC and the chassis changed into cylinders. In 2006, Sch√§rfe System was acquired by Innovatis AG, a company focused on cell culture analysis. CASY utilizes the techniques of electric current exclusion and pulse area analysis, the cells can be analyzed and counted in an efficient and precise manner. This technology can be applied for cell counting, cell culture analysis at a certain time interval, or even a period of time. Principle of CASY technology Cell viability can be assessed based on the integrity of plasma membrane: the living cells have intact plasma membranes whereas membranes of dead cells are broken. When a cell is exposed to a low voltage field, the electric current cannot go through the intact membrane, which is an electric insulator, if it is viable. Otherwise, as the cellular membrane is broken, electric field can go through the injured cell as there are pores on their membrane. For a normal cell, its size cannot be smaller than its nuclear size, which is the criterion to distinguish between living cells and dead cells. As a result, when cells in an electrolyte or a particular buffer, they are aligned one by one to a precision measuring pore and exposed to the electric field, each of their information can be captured and the culture condition, including its concentration, viability and volume, can be analyzed. For example, when the living cells get greater volume and pass through the current flow, a greater pulse, in amp-1, can be generated and then amplified. As the cell size is related to the cell volume, a cell size profile in cell population can be produced in terms of pulse height. Since the cells are scanned at such high frequency, a precise result and a high resolution can be produced. These results from each cell are cumulated and assigned in a calibrated multi-channel analyser with over 500,000 channels. So, for the CASY technology, as the cell flow cytometry, it can present data of each cell as a cell size distribution graph, which has 2 variables, the change in cell volume and that in cell viability. The materials passing through the apparatus can be gated. For the newly invented equipments, they have an automatically lower threshold at 7 um, which can exclude small particles and cell debris in the cell culture. At the same time, there will be an upper threshold to prevent from cell aggregation for counting. However, some of users may set upper threshold to unlimited for cell size. Since the cell size of each cell type is varied, before doing gating, it should ensure the correct cell size is included during the cell size related experiment.CASY CELL COUNTERS, CASY technology for viable cell counting. [Online]. In SEDNA SCIENTIDIC. Available: http://www.sednascientific.com/CASY-Cell-counters.html [17 November 2008] Advantages Since the cell viability is determined by electric current exclusion, viability dyes such as Trypan blue and Propidium iodide are not needed. Hence, cell viability determination need no longer be a terminal experiment. This advantage permits subsequent tests using the cells such as viability after a further time interval. The given result will be very accurate because not only are all steps performed robotically, but are high throughput (e.g. a million events/second). CASY technology it is fast but also reliable and reproducible because of features such as the multi-channel analyzer for detecting and analyzing the pulse height generation. In fact, a channel means the pulse counted in a particular energy. In the past, single channel analyzers were used the instruments. They can count the pulse in a narrow range only. So, they can analyze the cells for one or few times at the set frequency only. Once the electric current is changed during the cell transfer, it could not be detected. This can use not only a much time for analysis but also inaccurate cell counting result. However, for the multi- channel analyzer, it can scan the entire energy range and the pulses in each channel. As there are more than 500, 000 channels for a cell counting, once a cell is pass through the measuring pore, there would be a lot of channel monitoring for 1 cell. As a result, the speed of CASY technology to obtain the information of cells can be very high. Applications One of CASY technology applications is electronic cell counter for determining cell number and their viability in a sample. The equipment is shown as Fig. 3 and the Fig. 4 states the result, including the total cell count, as well as the percentage of debris, living cells and dead cells, displayed on the screen of the cell counter. Lindl et al. (2005) Lindl T., Lewandowski B., Sheyrogg S., Staudte A.. (2005) Evaluation of the In Vitro Cytotoxicities of 50 Chemicals by using an Electronic Current Exclusion Method versus the Neutral Red Uptake and MTT Assays. In Alternatives to laboratory animals, 33: 591-601 has compared the CASY technology to two standard methods for cell viability measurement, including the neutral red uptake and MTT assay. They found that the most sensitive IC50 values, which were the closest to those in the literature, were performed by this electronic cell counter. Some toxicants in these experiments by using chemical methods would affect the mechanisms of the assays. So, the results would become invalid. However, for the electronic cell counter, it can not only monitor all the cells changes, even the cell necrosis, by various toxicants types and concentration, but also a complex mixture of toxicants in the cell culture. It would be seen that the progress changes of dying cells can be detected as well. On the other hand, all the results from electric cell counter could be transferred to the computers with common spreadsheet programs. No other specific software would be set up to every computer to obtain the result. Differences between CASY and Coulter cell counting A Coulter counter The Coulter Principle. [Online]. In Becker Coulter. Available: http://www.beckmancoulter.com/coultercounter/homepage_tech_coulter_principle.jsp [22 November 2008] is one of the other devices used for cell counting. Like CASY technology, this also uses electric current for cell counting. However, the difference between them is that there is an aperture called ‚Äúsensing zone‚Äù, with a known volume of electrolyte in a coulter counter. When suspended cells pass through it, they would displace the equivalent volume of electrolyte in the sensing zone and cause a short term change of electric current across the aperture. Since the circuit is to detect the change of current across it, any particles that can displace the electrolyte will be counted. It would be seen that the measurement of cells would be from a volume to another volume in the same sample. In contrast, the CASY technology incorporates no electrolytic reservoir in the aperture and the cells in the electrolyte can pass through the measuring pore. It would not be necessary to detect the cells from a batch to another batch but measure them continuously and smoothly.

History The school was built in the early 1960s. The previous school it replaced was called the Cagthorpe School. It is a specialist science college. In September 2008, a new block was opened to the rear of the school. The new block is home to: Two Art Studios, A Textiles and Food Technology Workrooms; Technology Workshops and a Music Suite with industry standard recording studio and 4 small practice rooms. Also in 2008 the Science block was extended adding a further two Science Laboratories. The new addition to the school was built by the Gelder Group of Sturton by Stow. In May 2008, the county council opened a ¬£400,000 children's centre, based at the school. In December 2014 Banovallum School converted to academy status and is now independent of local authority control. However the school continues to coordinate with Lincolnshire County Council for admissions. Admissions It is situated on the A153, 500m to the south of the town. The school day is from 8.50am until 3.35pm. The school has three houses, named after RAF planes: Hurricane , Lancaster , Spitfire . These two last aircraft, have flown operationally from the nearby RAF Coningsby. in recent years the house system has decreased from 5 to 3 with the disbanding of Tornado , Jaguar , both of which existed when the House system was brought into effect in 2006. After the first year, Jaguar house was 'disbanded' leaving the four houses that remain. In the '70s and '80s there were four houses named after famous Lincolnshire characters from history. The houses were: Franklin , Hereward , Newton and Tennyson . The gym hosts regional gymnastic competitions, and is the home of Banovallum Gymnastics Club.

He first studied in Ypres with Lionel Blomme (1897-1984). In 1935 he matriculated at the Royal Conservatory in Brussels, and there won awards in the study of viola, fugue, counterpoint and chamber music. In 1941, Legley began studying with Jean Absil, and in 1943 he received the second Belgian Prix de Rome. After World War II he played in the Brussels Opera Orchestra and also in the D√©clin Quartet, where he encountered the music of B√©la Bart√≥k and of Arnold Schoenberg. At about this time (in 1942) he wrote his first symphony, first of a series of eight (the last of which was written in 1993 and premiered in 1994), and also his first string quartet (first of five, 1941‚Äì63, 1990) (Randel, Don Michael (1996).) .

He made his first appearance during the episode broadcast on 4 August 1994 and departed six years later on 22 August 2000. Development The five-strong Glover family, consisting of parents Ned Glover (Johnny Leeze) and Jan Glover (Roberta Kerr), and their three children Dave Glover (Ian Kelsey), Linda Glover (Tonicha Jeronimo) and Roy were introduced in August 1994. In their fictional backstory, the Glovers came from the South, like the McAllisters and Windsors who were introduced in 1993, but they were a hardworking Yorkshire family. The Glovers initially live in a caravan on the Sugden's land, after being forced out of their old plot by developers. Roy is the youngest member of the family, and an Inside Soap columnist predicted he would make friends with fellow teen Scott Windsor (Ben Freeman) and get up to \\"plenty of pranks\\". In a notable storyline for the character, Roy almost loses two fingers in an accident with a wood-chopping machine. Roy cuts his fingers off as he is left unsupervised and his hand slips. Evans described it as \\"quite a graphic scene when the camera moves in and you see my hand without them.\\" He also said it was \\"a difficult scene\\" as they had to film multiple takes to get \\"the horror over without being too sickening.\\" Roy's sister saves his fingers and he undergoes surgery to reattach them. Evans was initially delighted when he received the script for the scenes, before realising how long the storyline would span, as Roy goes through months of recovery. Evans had to wear a splint for six months and he had difficulty filming with it on. He added, \\"It is certainly one of the most dramatic moments I've been involved in on Emmerdale and I was really pleased with the way the scene looks.\\" Evans chose to leave Emmerdale in 2000. Storylines Roy moves to the village with his parents Ned and Jan, and his older siblings Dave and Linda. Roy befriends Scott Windsor and his step-sister Kelly Windsor (Adele Silva) at school. Roy and Kelly have a brief romantic relationship. Roy is a troublesome teenager. When Linda and her boyfriend Biff Fowler (Stuart Wade) clean Alan Turner's (Richard Thorp) Landrover for him, Roy throws mud and dirt all over it, so he can clean it again and get paid. Roy loses two of his fingers in an accident with a circular saw whilst cutting some wood and spends time in hospital where he has them surgically reattached. Both of Roy's older siblings die, Dave in a fire at Home Farm and Linda in a car crash, leaving him the last surviving Glover child. Roy and Kelly get back together, and eventually marry. Scott reveals that he and Kelly have been having an affair, but Kelly denies everything and Roy believes her. Once married, Roy and Kelly suffer financial difficulties and take cleaning jobs. Kelly borrows some jewellery from one of their clients and holds a dinner party at their home. When the police are called, Roy protects Kelly and takes the blame, leading to his arrest and imprisonment. When he is released, Kelly finally admits that she has been having an affair with Scott, and plans to move to London. Roy forgives her and he and Kelly briefly reconcile. They decide to start a new life in Ibiza, with Roy's father Ned (Johnny Leese) but as they are about to leave, Kelly reveals that she intends for them to scam Ned and his girlfriend Dawn Wilkins out of their business and take it over. Angry that Kelly has not changed and is still as ruthless as ever, Roy breaks up with her in the airport and leaves her there, departing for Ibiza alone. Reception Lamenting the character's departure, Robert Beaumont of The Press wrote: \\"Poor Roy is an icon to losers in the land, a living reminder that life can be worse. How he has survived with this spoiled bitch of a wife Kelly is a mystery to all of us. So, too, is his hair.\\" The Guardian's Gareth McLean branded Roy \\"saintly but simple\\". Molly Blake from Birmingham Evening Mail was pleased that Roy broke up with Kelly, saying \\"Oh, yes! At long last Roy Glover has discovered he'll be happier snuggling up with his sideburns than with sourpuss and promiscuous Kelly, ditching her at the airport en route to Ibiza where's he's to live with dad, the Neanderthally slow-thinking Ned.\\" References Category:Emmerdale characters Category:Television characters introduced in 1994 Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Roy Glover"},{"id":"20723111","text":"A macrocyst is an aggregate of cells of Dictyostelids formed during sexual reproduction enclosed in a cellulose wall.

Its name means \\"maple\\" in Japanese. With the irradiation of ultraviolet light (350‚Äì400 nm), Kaede undergoes irreversible photoconversion from green fluorescence to red fluorescence. Kaede is a homotetrameric protein with the size of 116 kDa. The tetrameric structure was deduced as its primary structure is only 28 kDa. This tetramerization possibly makes Kaede have a low tendency to form aggregates when fused to other proteins.  Discovery  The property of photoconverted fluorescence Kaede protein was serendipitously discovered and first reported by Ando et al. in Proceedings of the United States National Academy of Sciences. An aliquot of Kaede protein was discovered to emit red fluorescence after being left on the bench and exposed to sunlight. Subsequent verification revealed that Kaede, which is originally green fluorescent, after exposure to UV light is photoconverted, becoming red fluorescent. It was then named Kaede.  Properties  The property of photoconversion in Kaede is contributed by the tripeptide, His62-Tyr63-Gly64, that acts as a green chromophore that can be converted to red. Once Kaede is synthesized, a chromophore, 4-(p-hydroxybenzylidene)-5-imidazolinone, derived from the tripeptide mediates green fluorescence in Kaede. When exposed to UV, Kaede protein undergoes un conventional cleavage between the amide nitrogen and the Œ± carbon (CŒ±) at His62 via a formal Œ≤-elimination reaction. Followed by the formation of a double bond between His62-CŒ± and ‚ÄìCŒ≤, the œÄ-conjugation is extended to the imidazole ring of His62. A new chromophore, 2-[(1E)-2-(5-imidazolyl)ethenyl]-4-(p-hydroxybenzylidene)-5-imidazolinone, is formed with the red-emitting property. The cleavage of the tripeptide was analysed by SDS-PAGE analysis. Unconverted green Kaede shows one band at 28 kDa, where two bands at 18 kDa and 10 kDa are observed for converted red Kaede, indicating that the cleavage is crucial for the photoconversion. A shifting of the absorption and emission spectrum in Kaede is caused by the cleavage of the tripeptide. Before the photoconversion, Kaede displays a major absorption wavelength maximum at 508 nm, accompanied with a slight shoulder at 475 nm. When it is excited at 480 nm, green fluorescence is emitted with a peak of 518 nm. When Kaede is irradiated with UV or violet light, the major absorption peak shifts to 572 nm. When excited at 540 nm, Kaede showed an emission maximum at 582 nm with a shoulder at 627 nm and the 518-nm peak. Red fluorescence is emitted after this photoconversion. The photoconversion in Kaede is irreversible. Exposure in dark or illumination at 570 nm cannot restore its original green fluorescence. A reduced fluorescence is observed in red, photoconverted Kaede when it is intensively exposed to 405 nm light, followed by partial recover after several minutes.  Applications  As all other fluorescent proteins, Kaede can be the regional optical markers for gene expression and protein labeling for the study of cell behaviors. One of the most useful applications is the visualization of neurons. Delineation of an individual neuron is difficult due to the long and thin processes which entangle with other neurons. Even when cultured neurons are labeled with fluorescent proteins, they are still difficult to identify individually because of the dense package. In the past, such visualization could be done conventionally by filling neurons with Lucifer yellow or sulforhodamine, which is a laborious technique.[1] After the discovery of Kaede protein, it was found to be useful in delineating individual neurons. The neurons are transfected by Kaede protein cDNA, and are UV irradiated. The red, photoconverted Kaede protein has free diffusibility in the cell except for the nucleus, and spreads over the entire cell including dendrites and axon. This technique help disentangle the complex networks established in a dense culture. Besides, by labeling neurons with different colors by UV irradiating with different duration times, contact sites between the red and green neurons of interest are allowed to be visualized. The ability of visualization of individual cells is also a powerful tool to identify the precise morphology and migratory behaviors of individual cells within living cortical slices. By Kaede protein, a particular pair of daughter cells in neighboring Kaede- positive cells in the ventricular zone of mouse brain slices can be followed. The cell-cell borders of daughter cells are visualized and the position and distance between two or more cells can be described. As the change in the fluorescent colour is induced by UV light, marking of cells and subcellular structures is efficient even when only a partial photoconversion is induced.  Advantages as an optical marker  Due to the special property of photo- switchable fluorescence, Kaede protein possesses several advantages as an optical cell marker. After the photoconversion, the photoconverted Kaede protein emits bright and stable red fluorescence. This fluorescence can last for months without anaerobic conditions. As this red state of Kaede is bright and stable compared to the green state, and because the unconverted green Kaede emits very low intensity of red fluorescence, the red signals provides contrast. Besides, before the photoconversion, Kaede emits bright green fluorescence which enables the visualization of the localization of the non- photoacivated protein. This is superior to other fluorescent proteins such as PA-GFP and KFP1, which only show low fluorescence before photoactivation. In addition, as both green and red fluorescence of Kaede are excited by blue light at 480 nm for observation, this light will not induce photoconversion. Therefore, illumination lights for observation and photoconversion can be separated completely.  Limitations  In spite of the usefulness in cell tracking and cell visualization of Kaede, there are some limitations. Although Kaede will shift to red upon the exposure of UV or violet light and display a 2,000-fold increase in red-to-green fluorescence ratio, using both the red and green fluorescence bands can cause problems in multilabel experiments. The tetramerization of Kaede may disturb the localization and trafficking of fusion proteins. This limits the usefulness of Kaede as a fusion protein tag.  Ecological significance  The photoconversion property of Kaede does not only contribute to the application on protein labeling and cell tracking, it is also responsible for the vast variation in the colour of stony corals, Trachyphyllia geoffroyi. Under sunlight, due to the photoconversion of Kaede, the tentacles and disks will turn red. As green fluorescent Kaede is synthesized continuously, these corals appear green again as more unconverted Kaede is created. By the different proportion of photoconverted and unconverted Kaede, great diversity of colour is found in corals.

Between 1930 and 1950, Voegeli practiced medicine in India at her own private hospital. During this time, with the assistance of 9 volunteers, she experimented with a process of heat-based contraception.Shouldn't You Be on the Pill? The process was simple and effective. A man would bathe his testes in a hot bath for 45 minutes a day for 3 weeks. On the completion of the 3 weeks, a period of infertility was recorded by the volunteers. Different bath temperatures produced varying lengths of infertility. A bath of 116 ¬∞F (46.7 ¬∞C) would provide contraceptive protection for 6 months. A bath of 110¬∞ (43.3 ¬∞C) would provide contraception for at least 4 months. After fertility returned in the males, the conception of healthy offspring with normal childhood development was recorded.Male contraception: Heat methods Voegeli retired from medicine in 1950 and spent the next 20 years involved in efforts to publicise the contraceptive method, which were largely ignored.CONTRACEPTION THROUGH TEMPORARY MALE STERILIZATION References Category:Birth control activists Category:Swiss women physicians Category:Swiss andrologists Category:Human reproduction Category:Year of birth missing Category:Date of birth missing Category:Year of death missing Category:University of Paris alumni Category:Columbia University alumni ","title":"Marthe Voegeli"},{"id":"20723174","text":"The Christ the King College of Cavite Foundation (formerly Christ the King School of Cavite) is a private, non-sectarian and coeducational school in San Marino City, Bo.

This method enables scientists to separate different cells with different sizes. Since cell size is correlated with cell cycle stages this method also allows the separation of cells at different stages of the cell cycle. Principle The key concept is that larger cells tend to stay within the flowing buffer solution while smaller cells will be washed away follow the buffer solution (different sedimentation property within the buffer solution), and cells will have different sedimentation properties in different cell cycle stages. The basic principle of separating the cells inside CCE is the balance between centripetal and the counter flow drag force. When the cells enter the elutriation chamber, all the cells will stay at the outer edge of the chamber due to centrifugal force. Then when the flow rate of the buffer solution increases, the solution tends to push the cells towards the middle of the CCE. When the counter flow drag force outweighs the centripetal force, particles will be driven by the net force and leave the chamber. Smaller particles are able to leave the chamber at lower flow rates. In contrast, larger particles will stay within the elutriation chamber. Therefore, buffer flow rate can be used to control size sorting within the elutriation chamber. Advantages During the separation, the cell only needs to be suspended in a buffer solution and enter a centrifuge, the whole processes does not involve any chemical (e.g. staining) and physical (e.g. attachment of antibody, lyses of cell membrane) effect on the cells, so the cell will remain unchanged before and after the separation. Because of this, the collected cells can be used for further experiment or further separation by other techniques. Finally the CCE rely on centrifugal force and the counter flow drag force to separate the cells, so the speed of separation is fast. In summary: *Minimum effect on the cells *High recovery viability *Separated cells can be used further *Rapid Disadvantages As mentioned above, the CCE separates cells based on their sedimentation property but not specific features (e.g. surface protein, cell shape). It cannot separate different types of cells which have similar sedimentation properties. This means that previous purification needs to be done for mixed cell type sample. The CCE is also limited to cells which are able to be individually suspended in the buffer solution. Cells which always attach to something cannot be separated by the CCE.

It is considered the world's largest spider by leg span, which can reach up to . Description The colouration is yellowish-brown with several irregularly distributed dark spots on the rear half. The legs have wide dark bands before the first bend. Like all huntsman spiders, the legs of the giant huntsman spider are long compared to the body, and twist forward in a crab-like fashion. Apart from its size, the H. maxima can be distinguished from other species of Heteropoda by genital characteristics. On males, the cymbium is at least three times longer than the tegulum. The female is distinguished by a characteristically shaped epigyneal field with two anterior directed bands, and the course of their internal ducts. The giant huntsman spider is the largest member of the family Sparassidae, boasting a leg-span, and body-length. The largest known member of the Sparassidae known prior to the discovery of H. maxima was the Australian Beregama aurea (L. Koch, 1875) with a body length of about . (Other relatively large members of Sparassidae have been discovered in recent years, including Cerbalus aravaensis, the largest in the Middle East). Taxonomy and naming Heteropoda maxima was first described in 2001 by P. J√§ger, after being discovered in a cave in Laos. Over a thousand new species of plant and animal were found between 1997 and 2007 in the Greater Mekong Subregion. A representative of the World Wide Fund for Nature stated that \\"some of these species really have no business being recently discovered\\", suggesting that it is surprising for such a large species to go undiscovered for so long. Distribution and habitat The giant huntsman spider is found in Laos, and is believed to be a cave dweller because of its pale colour, long legs and special hairs on the second foot of the male. There is no apparent reduction of the eyes, possibly because the species lives near cave entrances.

Biography Monica Poole was the daughter of Charles Reginald Poole and Gladys Aline Haskell. She lived in Kent for the greater part of her life, and according to Anne Stevens \\"found her subjects, and shapes in the rolling chalk downland, the lush wealden country and the shore line\\".Obituary in \\"The Independent\\" She attended Abbotsford School, then Broadstairs, and joined the Thanet School of Art at Margate in 1938, where she was introduced to wood-engraving by Geoffrey Wales. During the Second World War, between 1940 and 1945, she worked in an aircraft factory in Bedford. She spent the post-war years from 1945 to 1949 at the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London. Here she met Noel Rooke, a noted wood-engraver. It was John Farleigh's course on illustrating, though, that revealed and nurtured her talent for wood-engraving. In 1940 she had first seen and been inspired by Farleigh's illustrations for D.H. Lawrence's The Man Who Died (1935), which led to the idea of studying under him. She later, in 1985, produced a study \\"The Wood Engravings of John Farleigh\\". She married widower Alastair George Murison Small (1896-1969), a member of the Smalls of Dirnanean, in 1952. Murison Small was a former naval officer who had designed underwater weaponry. On his death on 14 September 1969, Poole retired to Tonbridge and quiet seclusion. Poole produced some 36 wood-engravings from 1977 to 1993, which were snapped up by discerning collectors. She had solo exhibitions at the London dealer Duncan Campbell in 1989 and 1993. She exhibited regularly with the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers, becoming an Associate in 1967 and a member in 1975. She was also a member of the Society of Wood Engravers and the Art Workers Guild. Her work may be seen in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the British Museum in London, the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in Edinburgh, the Boston Public Library and in many other collections. Her close friend and fellow wood-engraver, George Mackley, published a book on her prints in 1994. She was a reserved person and led a very private life. She contracted poliomyelitis at the age of six months, leaving her paraplegic until she was five years old. Further emotional scars followed with her elder sister's death at seven and her mother's suffering from tuberculosis. An extended stay in Switzerland between 1929 and 1931 aided in her mother's recovery and left Monica dazzled by the mountainous country.Obituary in The Guardian Bibliography * Monica Poole, The Wood Engravings of John Farleigh (1985.

It was the first major Egyptian victory of the war, and one of the few cases of Israeli surrender. The battle began on the night of June 6‚Äì7 with an artillery bombardment of Nitzanim, followed by an aerial bombardment and armored and infantry attacks. The main attack broke through the Israeli defenses at around 11:00; the Israelis retreated to a second position, and finally to a third position at 14:00. At 16:00, 105 Israelis surrendered to the Egyptian Army. Between June 7 and 10, the Battle of Hill 69 was fought nearby. The hill was captured by the Egyptians after a disorganized Israeli retreat. Israelis viewed the surrender of Nitzanim as a humiliation, especially after the Givati Brigade published a leaflet denouncing the defenders. The residents of Nitzanim demanded a probe into the battle, and one was conducted by the General Staff, siding with the residents and coming to the conclusion that surrender was justified. Background Givati troops in Nitzanim Kibbutz Nitzanim, founded in 1943, was an isolated Israeli village on the coastal plain, enclosed by the Arab localities of Isdud in the north, Majdal in the south, and Julis and Beit Daras in the east. It was drawn inside the Arab state in the defunct United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine. As such, Nitzanim was isolated after December 31, 1947.Ayalon (1963), pp. 99‚Äì105 It was attacked many times in the first six months of the 1947‚Äì1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine by local irregulars. The Jewish defenders used old Italian World War I rifles and managed to repel the attacks. In March 1948, Haganah forces from the headquarters in Be'er Tuvia broke through to the village, but on the way back were ambushed and the Haganah commander of Nitzanim, Shlomo Rubinstein, was killed in action. On March 26 and April 20, organized Arab attacks took place, and were repelled by the villagers.Wallach (2003), pp. 188‚Äì189 The Niztanim collective was located 700 meters west of the coastal road. Its expanse, 800m long and 400m wide, did not allow for the formation of a second line of defense. The farmstead buildings were mostly built in a ravine surrounded by hills from all sides. To the north lied the \\"graveyard ridge\\", a convenient location for observations. Near it lay a wadi crater stretching west and allowing a convenient advance toward the farmstead from the north. To the east, the farmstead bordered a destroyed British camp, which allowed for an enemy advance right up to the farmstead fence. About two kilometers to the northeast was Hill 69, a position commanding the entire surrounding area.Hashavia (2005), p. 168 At noon on May 29, an observation post near Nitzanim reported that an Egyptian column of about 150 vehicles had passed along the coastal road to the north. The post later reported that 500 vehicles, an entire brigade, had been counted.Lorch (1968) p. 247 The observers were not trained in identifying military vehicles, and excitedly miscounted the vehicles passing. They exaggerated the numbers when they reported to the Givati Brigade.Hashavia (2005), p. 154 The Egyptian Army set up a position in Isdud between May 29 and June 1, for what Israelis presumed at the time to be thrust to capture Tel Aviv. However, the Egyptian advance stopped at the Ad Halom Bridge (over the Lakhish River to the north of Isdud), which had been destroyed by the Givati Brigade on May 12. As they made logistical preparations to cross the river, the column was bombed and engaged in Operation Pleshet (June 2‚Äì3).Wallach (2003), p. 24 The Egyptians therefore shifted their focus to clearing their flanks, focusing on Nitzanim as some of the injured Israelis who participated in Pleshet were evacuated there. While the nearby village of Beit Daras had been under Israeli control since May 11, there was no continuity with Nitzanim, as Hill 69, which separated the two villages, was not occupied.Wallach et al. (1978), \\"Battle of Nitzanim\\", p. 33 The Givati Brigade planned to capture the hill on the night of June 7‚Äì8, but did not anticipate the Egyptian attack on Nitzanim. The plan to capture the hill, however, was carried out on time.IDF History (1978), pp. 227‚Äì228 Prelude Avraham-Elkana Schwarzstein, the commander of Nitzanim =Israel= The evacuation of noncombatants, including children, was generally opposed by the Yishuv leadership. It was argued that Israel's aim in the war was the continuation of normal life and that under the circumstances, it was impossible to draw a line between front and rear. It was also feared that combatants would follow the noncombatants and abandon the settlements. Upon the Declaration of Independence on May, 15, this thinking was reversed. Operation Tinok (\\"Baby\\") saw the evacuation of children from Nitzanim, Negba, Gat, Gal-On and Kfar Menahem by armored cars or by foot to places further north, where they were considered to be relatively safer.Lorch (1968) pp. 245‚Äì246 On the night of May 16‚Äì17, 35 children from Nitzanim were evacuated on foot to Be'er Tuvia.Wallach et al. (1978), \\"Operation Tinok\\", p. 31 Orientation map The Israeli defenders of Nitzanim consisted of two platoons from the Givati Brigade's 53rd Battalion, one of which was made up of new recruits, for a total of 74 soldiers. The recruits had been brought in from the reserve 58th Battalion during Operation Pleshet, in order to free up a more experienced platoon from Nitzanim for the operation.Ayalon (1963), pp. 123‚Äì125 There were also 67 local paramilitaries, ten of them women, for a total of 141 combatants. The force had seventy rifles, thirty submachine guns, four Bren light machine guns, a 4-inch mortar, one PIAT and a few grenades.Yitzhaki (1988), pp. 95‚Äì97 Nitzanim had three elevations: the highest was in the northeast, where water towers were built; in the center was the dining hall; and to the south was the \\"Palace\\"/\\"Mansion\\", an abandoned Arab house which was higher than its surroundings. The three elevations were surrounded by a ring of positions connected by a series of communication ditches.Lorch (1968) p. 252 The local commander divided his force into fourteen positions, maintaining a reserve force for reinforcement of weak points and counterattacks in case the Egyptians broke through the position line.Hashavia (2005), p. 171 =Egypt= Having taken Yad Mordechai on May 23, the Egyptian force, under the command of Major General Ahmad Ali al-Mwawi went up along the coast and bypassed Nitzanim. After meeting with Israeli opposition near Ashdod, he decided to stop and consolidated his positions. Naguib was to dig in at Ashdod, another force was to attack Negba, while Mwawi himself would attack Nitzanim to eliminate its threat to his rear.Pollack (2002), pp. 18‚Äì19 The Egyptian Army set up its main position in the abandoned British military base just east of Nitzanim, with smaller positions in the Cemetery Hill to the northeast and the citrus grove in the south, thus surrounding the village. Mwawi took several days to carefully work out the attack.Pollack (2002), p. 19 It was to be carried out in three phases: breakthrough and capture of the water tank hill, capture of the dining hall hill and capture of the \\"Palace\\".Lorch (1968) p. 253 The Egyptian force consisted of the 9th Battalion, the 3rd Company of the 7th Battalion and a medium machine gun platoon. They were also joined by a tank platoon, an AFV company, 18 pieces of field artillery, 12 anti-tank guns, an anti-aircraft battery, and supported by combat aircraft. BattleNitzanim= The \\"Palace\\" preserved in Old Nitzanim At midnight on July 6‚Äì7, Egyptian forces began a bombardment of Nitzanim from the Cemetery Hill using Bofors cannons and 25-pounders, and at 06:00, a close-range bombardment using anti-tank guns. All of the prominent features in the village were destroyed. An additional mortar bombardment took place from a southeastern position, and a 6-pounder shelling from the water tank hill in the south. Shortly after, an attack was attempted from the east, but it was repelled and the water tank hill remained under Israeli control. At 08:00, the Egyptians began an aerial bombardment of the kibbutz, which came in three waves and continued until 10:15, at which time shelling continued in the form of 25-pounder fire from Majdal about 7 km away. At 11:00, the main thrust of infantry and four tanks commenced. The rest of the armored vehicles provided cover from the adjacent abandoned British base. The Israelis used the lone PIAT in their possession against the tanks and forced them to retreat, although the PIAT broke down and the Egyptian 1st Company (9th Battalion) managed to infiltrate the water tank hill. Position 1 was destroyed and buried its inhabitants, who were in a state of shock when evacuated from the rubble. The telephone system was cut down. A machine gun, aimed at the planes, was hit by a shell. Most of the Israelis' firearms got dirty from the dust, and one machine gun broke down. Since the beginning of the attack, the signal operator tried to contact the 53rd Battalion headquarters at Beer Tuvia. At 10:00, she managed to get an SOS through before losing contact completely. Near 11:00, four Egyptian tanks were ordered to break through into the farmstead, followed by infantry. The tanks advanced from the northeastern corner of the camp, and were met by two Israelis armed with PIATs. They managed to hit the track of one of the tanks on the second shot. The tanks halted, but the PIAT soon broke down and its operator suffered a head wound. The tanks retreated and continued to shell the Israeli position. The Egyptian infantry kept advancing, taking over positions 10, 11, 12, and capturing the water tanks area. The Egyptians reported victory.Hashavia (2005), p. 172 Twelve Israelis were killed by the tank shells. The Egyptians then started the second phase of their plan‚Äîtaking over the northwestern position and the dining hall area. The 4th Company of the 9th Battalion used a tank which broke through the farmstead fence at 12:30 opposite position 8, in the center of Nitzanim's northern fence, after killing six out of the seven Israelis manning the position and blinding the seventh. Schwarzstein, until then posted in the northeastern corner of the smaller orchard, moved to the dining hall and the nearby residence area, which were surrounded by embankments. He was hoping to form a second line and ordered the men from positions 5, 6, and 7 in the north to move to the dining hall area. There, he organized the reserve forces who retreated from the cowshed and the men from the northern positions for defense. Many of the male prisoners of war in Egypt The Egyptians commenced heavy shelling of the dining hall, and by 14:00, the defenders decided to retreat to the \\"Palace\\" in the south for a last stand. At 15:00, a retreat of all forces southwards from the village was attempted, but was stalled by the 2nd Company of the 9th Battalion situated in the citrus groves, that forced the Israelis back to the \\"Palace\\". 2‚Äì4 Israelis managed to hide in the groves and escape to Be'er Tuvia at night. Throughout the battle, the Israeli forces tried to communicate with the rest of the army and request reinforcements, including three telegrams near the end of the battle, sent by the signal operator Miriam Ben-Ari. All attempts failed and reinforcements were not sent. The wounded commander, Avraham-Elkana Schwarzstein, carrying his bloodstained white shirt, and Ben-Ari, tried to negotiate with the Egyptians, but Schwarzstein was shot by an Egyptian officer. In response, Ben- Ari shot the one responsible and was killed on the spot. At 16:00 on June 7, 105 exhausted Israeli defenders, 26 of them injured, destroyed their remaining ammunition and equipment, and surrendered to the Egyptian forces. The Egyptians prevented their local auxiliaries from massacring all the prisoners, however, three or four of the defenders were killed after surrendering.Morris (2008), pp. 243‚Äì244 Survivors were later \\"displayed\\" in a victory parade in Majdal, after which they were transferred to Cairo. In all, 33 were killed in the battle‚Äî17 soldiers and 16 villagers (of them 3 women). =Hill 69= Hill 69 Three men managed to escape from Nitzanim during the day. They hid until nightfall and then infiltrated through the Egyptian lines until they reached the Givati outposts. They were not aware that Nitzanim had surrendered and the only information about it was received from Egyptian broadcasts, so the Givati commander Shimon Avidan found that out only that evening. Despite the fall of Nitzanim, he decided to attack on the night of June 7‚Äì8, as planned. One company took Hill 69 and positions to threaten the Egyptian lines at Isdud and prepared to recapture Nitzanim. Meanwhile, another, unsuccessful, attack was carried out against Isdud. Hill 69 was considered tactically important as an obstacle on the road to Isdud in face of the imminent truce. Monument to the fallen Israeli soldiers on Hill 69 On the night of June 9‚Äì10, Givati's 52nd Battalion, guided by two of the escapees, attacked Nitzanim. Zero hour was postponed after the attacking force lost its way. At dawn, the leading platoon managed to break into Nitzanim from the south and capture the \\"Palace\\", but was ordered to withdraw after being hit by heavy Egyptian fire, having lost the cover of darkness.Ayalon (1982), p. 161 The Egyptian artillery pursued the withdrawing Israeli force until it reached Hill 69. The 52nd Battalion forces were evacuated by armored vehicles, and soon after, the Egyptians attacked the hill, which was held by a company from the 51st Battalion.Wallach et al. (1978), \\"The Battle on the Hill\\", p. 33 The ditches collapsed completely and the positions were destroyed. The large force that was concentrated on the hill suffered heavy casualties. The Egyptian infantry attacked from the west, supported from close range by Bren Carriers and armored cars. The Israeli company broke, and was ordered to retreat, but the withdrawal was disorganized and cost more casualties. The last Israeli to remain on the hill was an artillery observer, who ordered his guns to bring down fire on his own position, before being killed. The total Israeli death toll on the hill and the retreat from it was 20.Wallach (2003), p. 43 The Egyptians tried to continue towards Beit Daras and Be'er Tuvia, but met with heavy opposition. At nightfall, they withdrew.Lorch (1968) pp. 254‚Äì255 Aftermath The memorial at Nitzanim The Battle of Nitzanim was one of the few Israeli surrenders during the war and was seen by many as humiliating. The 105 prisoners captured at Nitzanim constituted the majority of POWs captured by Egypt during the entire war.Gelber (2006), p. 149 According to the POWs, the Egyptian media covered the event widely, writing that 300 Jews were killed in Nitzanim, that it was a major submarine base, and that much booty was captured, including oil and fuel. Yitzhak Pundak, the battalion commander who was directly responsible for the village's defense, claims that actions could have been taken to save it, including transferring Napoleonchik cannons to the site. Following the capture of Hill 69, a major obstacle was removed for Egypt, which enabled it to attack Gal On and capture Gezer. When Givati finally reached Nitzanim after Operation Yoav, they found the village abandoned and largely destroyed, as the Egyptians retreated south to Gaza. The Israelis killed in action were buried in a mass grave in the village. The villagers who returned from captivity on March 7, 1949, as part of the 1949 Armistice Agreements, rebuilt Nitzanim on a site a few kilometers south of the original. The Nitzanim Youth Village was built in 1949 on the site of the battle, and closed in 1990, where Nitzan was founded later. The site was turned into a tourist attraction, featuring a visual presentation and various monuments, including the Women of Valor Center (, Yad LeIsha Lohemet), a monument for all female warriors killed in action in Israel's wars, especially the three in Nitzanim: Miriam Ben-Ari, the intern paramedic Shulamit Dorczin, and the 18-year-old Deborah Epstein who died of her wounds in captivity. =Reactions in Israel= Abba Kovner, then the culture officer of the Givati Brigade, published a scathing leaflet denouncing the defenders. Nisan Reznik, who was one of the fighters in Nitzanim, and knew Kovner from before World War II, claimed that the letter was a result of egoism. Part of the leaflet read: > ... The fighters on the southern front, soldiers of the brigade, defenders > of the settlements! The hour of Nitzanim's surrender‚Äîis the hour of extreme > grief and personal reflection‚Äîand a personal reflection says: One doesn't > defend one's home conditionally. Defense means with all the forces at the > command of one's body and soul, and if fate should so decree, it is better > to fall in the trenches of the home than to surrender ... To surrender as > long as the body lives and the last bullet breathes in the clip is a > disgrace. To fall into the invader's captivity is shame and death! > ‚ÄîAbba Kovner, partial text of the Givati leaflet, signed by Shimon > Avidan. As a result, Nitzanim's members demanded an investigation into the battle immediately after the war ended, claiming that Kovner significantly and unrightfully harmed their reputation. The investigation was headed by the Chief of Staff Ya'akov Dori, who sided with the defenders and wrote: > The difficult circumstances of the battle by the residents of Nitzanim, the > bitter isolation of the combatants, the lack of communication with the rear- > front, lack of ammunition and food, and due to the high number of casualties > in that defense, brings honor to all those who fought bitterly there, until > the last bullet. What happened in Nitzanim happened also to other places, > the defenders of which fought bravely to the last option. > ‚ÄîYa'akov Dori Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion also praised the defenders of Nitzanim. A thriller called Target - Tel Aviv () by Ram Oren was published in 2004, focusing on the battle and its aftermath. = In the historiography of the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War = In the historical debate about the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Benny Morris takes the example of Nitzarim at two times to draw a comparison between Israeli and Arab attitudes during the war. He points out that: * \\"[like at Nitzanim], all the Jewish settlements conquered by the invading [Arab armies] (...) were razed after their inhabitants had fled or been incarcerated or expelled\\" and that \\"[t]hese expulsions by the Arab regular armies stemmed quite naturally from the expulsionist mindset prevailing in the Arab states\\", drawing a parallel with the Israeli attitude during the war.Morris (2008), pp. 407‚Äì410 * \\"... the Arab regular armies committed few atrocities and no large-scale massacre of POWs and civilians in the conventional war‚Äîeven though they conquered [some places such as Nitzanim]\\"Morris (2008), p. 405 ReferencesBibliography=    * * External links * Battle map carved on wood on the site of Old Nitzanim * Battle map and description of the battle * The Story of Nitzanim at the Kibbutz website Category:Battles and operations of the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War Category:June 1948 events ","title":"Battle of Nitzanim"},{"id":"20723473","text":"Carnatic raga refers to ragas used in Carnatic music. A Carnatic raga has several components - primordial sound (nƒÅda), tonal system (swara), pitch (≈õruti), scale, ornaments (gamaka) and important tones. Origins and historyCarnatic raga classification=Janaka ragas (Melakarta ragas) and Janya ragas(Upanga ragas) Janaka ragas or Sampoorna ragas are parent ragas from which more ragas are derived. Sampoorna ragas as the name suggest are those in which all 7 swaras are present. They are also called Melakarta ragas. These ragas have all 7 swaras or [notes] in their scales (only one of each swara, Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni), following strict ascending and descending scales and are sung in all octaves. Example of melakartha ragas are : Shankarabharanam, Kalyani, Natabhairavi, Chala Nattai, Harikambhoji, Kharaharapriya, Mayamalavagowla, Chakravakam etc. Janya ragas are ragas that are derived from Janaka ragas (Melakarta ragas). They may have less than 7 notes in their scales, or have additional notes in them, zig-zag (vakra) notes that step up and down, asymmetrical scales, etc. Janya raga is also called as Upanga raga. Example of Upanga ragas are : Malahari, Mohanam, Begada, Shriragam, Hamsadhvani, Bilahari, Vasanta, Kambhoji, Janaranjani, Hindolam, Todi etc. =72 Melakartha ragas (Mathematical computation)= There are different types of swara sthayis or note pitches that leads to the total number of melakartha ragas. These different variations of swaras leads to more than one combination of musical scale. The different variations in swaras is mentioned below. Using this it is possible to mathematically ascertain the total number of melakartha ragas. Sa (Shadja) - only one. Ri (Rishabha) - Shuddha, Chathushruthi and Shatshruti Rishabha in increasing order of pitch. Ga (Gandhara) - Shuddha, Sadharana, Antara Gandhara in increasing order of pitch. Ma (Madhyama) - Shuddha, Prathi Madhyama in increasing order of pitch. Pa(Panchama)- only one. Dha (Daivata) -Shuddha, Chatushruti, Shatshruti Daivata in increasing order of pitch. Ni (Nishada)- Shuddha, Kaishiki, Kakali Nishadham in increasing order of pitch. However, there are only some combinations that are allowed as for instance Shatshruthi Ri can combine with Antara Gandhara and Chathushruti Rishabha can combine with Sadharana and Antara Gandhara only. Likewise the same principle holds good for Da and Ni. If we label these swaras as Sa, Ra, Ri, Ru, Ga, Gi, Gu, Ma, Mi, Pa, Dha, Dhi, Dhu, Na, Ni, Nu. The total combinations are: a) 1 Sa X 1 Ra X 3(Ga, Gi, Gu) Ga + 1 Sa X Ru X 2 Ga (Gu, Gi) + 1 Sa X Ri X Gu = 6. b) Ma, Mi =2 c) 1 Pa X Dha X 3 Ni (Na, Ni, Nu)+ 1 Pa X Dhu X 2 Ni (Nu, Ni)+ 1 Pa X Dhi X Ni =6 Multiplying these 3 combinations we get 72. The 72 melakartha ragas are arranged in a cycle called katapayadi sutra which is named so because by the index of the raga we can get the name of the raga and the exact swara combination. The first 36 melakartha ragas have suddha madhyama whereas, the next 36 ragas have prathi madhyama. The 72 combinations of melakartha ragas gives rise to a huge variety of musical flavours. Any sampurna raga is present in this 72 melakartha cycle. From these 72 melakartha ragas, there are more than a thousand janya ragas that contain more beautiful musical notations. While getting to know the details of a raga, it is important to know which sampurna raga the janya raga is derived from in order to know the swara types. http://www.karnatik.com/melas.shtml Janya ragas Janya ragas are ragas that are derived from Janaka ragas (Melakarta ragas). They may have less than 7 notes in their scales, or have additional notes in them, zig-zag (vakra) notes that step and down, asymmetrical scales, etc. See full list of Janya ragas. E.g. of janya ragas are bilahari and hamsadhwani (derived from shankarabharana), sriranjani and darbar (derived from kharaharapriya) and so on. Vakra ragas Vakra ragas are janya ragas that have swaras arranged in a zig zag manner. For e.g. Raga Sri has the following arohanam and avarohanam : S R M P N S. S. N P M R G R S. Such a raga is called vakra raga. Au·∏çava rƒÅgas Au·∏çava rƒÅgas are janya ragas that have exactly five notes in ascending and descending scale (arohana and avarohana). Examples are : 1)Mohanam (S R G P D S. S. D P G R S) 2)Hamsadhwani (S R G P N S. S. N P G R S) =Shadava Ragas= Shadava rƒÅgas are janya ragas that have exactly six notes in ascending and descending scale (arohana and avarohana) Components of Carnatic raga A Carnatic raga has several components - primordial sound (nƒÅda), tonal system (swara), intervals (shruti), scale, ornaments (gamaka) and important tones (vadi and samvadi). =NƒÅda= An aim of composer-performers of the past and present is to realise nƒÅda, however, the sound that is audible to human ears is only a fraction of primordial sound.Kassebaum (2000), p91 =Swara= The Carnatic tonal system consists of seven basic pitches, expressed by the solfa syllables: Sa (shadja), Ri (rishabha), Ga (gandhara), Ma (madhyama), Pa (panchama), Da (dhaivata) and Ni (nishadha). =Scale= A Carnatic raga consists of an ascending and descending scale pattern (known as aarohana and avarohana respectively). Both ascent and descent should have at least five tones, although rarer ragas contain fewer tones. Scales establish rules for all performers to adhere to in melodic performance, and provide a tonal boundary. Typical scale features also act to help listeners identify ragas.Kassebaum (2000), p93 =Gamaka= Gamaka, or ornamentation, is essential in Carnatic raga performance. Gamaka encompasses controlled shaking, articulating, sliding, glottal stops and other vocal or instrumental manipulation. The swara and scale defines only the skeletal structure of a raga. The handling of Gamaka actually defines the raga. Raga in improvisation Bharat Ratna M. S. Subbulakshmi, renowned vocalist of Carnatic classical music =Types= Improvisation in raga is the soul of Indian classical music \\\\- an essential aspect. \\"Manodharma sangeetham\\" or \\"kalpana sangeetham\\" (\\"music of imagination\\") as it is known in Carnatic music, embraces several varieties of improvisation.Kassebaum (2000), p17 Raga Alapana An alapana, sometimes also called ragam, is the exposition of a raga or tone - a slow improvisation with no rhythm,Royal Carpet: Glossary of Carnatic Terms R where the raga acts as the basis of embellishment. In performing alapana, performers consider each raga as an object that has beginnings and endings and consists somehow of sequences of thought. The performer will explore the ragam and touch on its various nuances, singing in the lower octaves first, then gradually moving up to higher octaves, while giving a hint of the song to be performed. Niraval Niraval, usually performed by the more advanced performers, consists of singing one or two lines of a song repeatedly, but with a series of melodic improvised elaborations. The lines are then also played at different levels of speed which can include double speed, triple speed, quadruple speed and even sextuple speed. Kalpanaswaram Kalpanaswaram, also known as swarakalpana, consists of improvising melodic and rhythmic passages using swaras (solfa syllables).Viswanathan & Cormack (1998), p219 Kalpanaswaras are sung to end on a particular swara in the raga of the melody and at a specific place (idam) in the tala cycle.Viswanathan & Cormack (1998), p221 Generally, the swaras are sung to end on the samam (the first beat of the rhythmical cycle), and can be sung at the same speed or double the speed of the melody that is being sung, though some artists sing triple-speed phrases too. Tanam Tanam is one of the most important forms of improvisation, and is integral to Ragam-Tanam-Pallavi. Originally developed for the veena, it consists of expanding the raga with syllables like tha, nam, thom, aa, nom, na, etc. Ragam-Tanam-Pallavi Ragam-Tanam-Pallavi is the principal long form in concerts, and is a composite form of improvisation. As the name suggests, it consists of raga alapana, tanam, and a pallavi line. Set to a slow-paced tala, the pallavi line is often composed by the performer. Through niraval, the performer manipulates the pallavi line in complex melodic and rhythmic ways. The niraval is followed by kalpanaswarams. =Learning and performing= When learning a raga, it is never enough just to know the basic scale of the raga. In fact, different ragas can sometimes have the same scales. For example, the raga pairs Bhairavi and Manji, Mayamalavagowla and Nadanamakriya, Bilahari and Mand, Shankarabharanam and Kurinji, among others, have exactly the same scale, but are clearly distinct ragas due to the way the notes and musical phrases are rendered. In addition, the scale of the raga often does not offer insight into some of the subtleties of the raga, such as usage of gamakas, anya swaras, and ragabhavam. This is especially true for heavier ragas like Yadhukula Kambodhi, Thodi, Sahana, Huseni, Varali, etc. An interesting case to observe is the similarity between the ragas Darbar and Nayaki. Both are upanga janyas of the 22nd mela Kharaharapriya, and have similar patterns in both their ascending and descending scales. However the two ragas are distinctly different, especially where the usage of the gandhara and nishada are concerned. When singing Darbar, these swaras are rendered more quickly with gamaka, and shine especially well when jante prayogas are used in the descending. On the other hand, these swaras are more elongated in Nayaki, as illustrated in the pallavi of Muttusvami Dikshitar's famous composition, RanganayakamBhavayeham. The best way to learn a raga and account for all its subtleties, therefore, is to refer to compositions, which often contain a wealth of phrases that lend beauty to the raga. Before an artist attempts to sing a raga, he or she should be familiar with several compositions in that raga. He or she should have also listened to many different renderings of the raga by various artists, in order to get a better sense of how certain phrases can be applied. =Improvisation and gender=Raga in dance and dramaRaga in non-classical traditionsRaga in devotional poetry and songRaga in Harikatha= The Harikatha tradition, which originated in the Indian state of Maharashtra, involves popular storytelling combined with dance and music. Krishna Bhagavathar, an exponent of Carnatic music, is responsible for creating the South Indian harikatha style - singing in raga, dancing with tala, and narrating stories in a manner that sustains the attention of the audience. In effect, Harikatha is an art form that requires knowledge of raga, Carnatic music, dance, speech, diction and dramatic technique. Harikatha performance aims to communicate with non-literate and literate audiences.Kassebaum (2000), p106 Ajjada Adibhatla Narayana Das is credited as creator of modern Harikatha format. Well-known harikatha performers had sound knowledge of Carnatic music in the early part of the 20th century - some were well established Carnatic musicians, while others were composers. Today, a few performers keep this tradition alive and use ragas from both Carnatic music and Hindustani music traditions. Raga and light classical musicRaga in film songs= In south Indian cinema, you will find many examples where a film song is composed based on a Carnatic raga or song. Generally pleasant ragas like Mohanam, Shankarabharanam, Kalyani, etc. find their way into numerous film songs.

As DNA is printed on a glass slide for the transfection process (the deliberate introduction of nucleic acids into cells) to occur before the addition of adherent cells, the order of addition of DNA and adherent cells is reverse that of conventional transfection. Hence, the word ‚Äúreverse‚Äù is used.  Process  Transfection-mix preparation for slide printing = A DNA- gelatin mixture may be used for printing onto a slide. Gelatin powder is first dissolved in sterile Milli-Q water to form a 0.2% gelatin solution. Purified DNA plasmid is then mixed with the gelatin solution, and the final gelatin concentration is kept greater than 0.17%. Besides gelatin, atelocollagen and fibronetin are also successful transfection vectors for introducing foreign DNA into the cell nucleus. = Slide printing of DNA-gelatin mixture = After the DNA-gelatin mixture preparation, the mixture is pipetted onto a slide surface and the slide is placed in a covered petri dish. A desiccant is added to the dish to dry up the solution. Finally, cultured cells are poured into the dish for plasmid uptake. However, with the invention of different types of microarray printing systems, hundreds of transfection mixes (containing different DNA of interest) may be printed on the same slide for cell uptake of plasmids.Reverse Transfection Homepage Retrieved 2011-10-14. There are two major types of microarray printing systems manufactured by different companies: contact and non-contact printing systems. An example of a non- contact printing system is the Piezorray Flexible Non-contact Microarraying System. It uses pressure control and a piezoelectric collar to squeeze out consistent drops of approximately 333 pL in volume. The PiezoTip dispensers do not contact the surface to which the sample is dispensed; thus, contamination potential is reduced and the risk of disrupting the target surface is eliminated. An example of a contact printing system is the SpotArray 72 (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences) contact-spotting system. Its printhead can accommodate up to 48 pins, and creates compact arrays by selectively raising and lowering subsets of pins during printing. After printing, the pins are washed with a powerful pressure-jet pin washer and vacuum-dried, eliminating carryover. Another example of a contact printing system is the Qarray system (Genetix). It has three types of printing systems: QArray Mini, QArray 2 and QArray Max. After printing, the solution is allowed to dry up and the DNA- gelatin is stuck tightly in position on the array. =HybriWell in reverse transfection= First, adhesive from the HybriWell is peeled off and the HybriWell is attached over the area of the slide printed with the gelatin-DNA solution. Second, 200ul of transfection mix is pipetted into one of the HybriWell ports; the mixture will distribute evenly over the array. The array is then incubated, with temperature and time dependent on the cell types used. Third, the transfection mix is pipetted away and the HybriWell removed with a thin-tipped forceps. Fourth, the printed slide treated with transfection reagent is placed into a square dish with the printed side facing up. Fifth, the harvested cells are gently poured onto the slides (not on the printed areas). Finally, the dish is placed in a 37¬∞C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator and incubated overnight. = Other reverse-transfection reagents = Effectene Reagent is used in conjunction with the enhancer and the DNA condensation buffer (Buffer EC) to achieve high transfection efficiency. In the first step of Effectene‚ÄìDNA complex formation, the DNA is condensed by interaction with the enhancer in a defined-buffer system. Effectene Reagent is then added to the condensed DNA to produce condensed Effectene‚ÄìDNA complexes. The Effectene‚ÄìDNA complexes are mixed with the medium and directly added to the cells. Effectene Reagent spontaneously forms micelle structures exhibiting no size or batch variation (as may be found with pre-formulated liposome reagents). This feature ensures reproducibility of transfection-complex formation. The process of highly condensing DNA molecules and then coating them with Effectene Reagent is an effective way to transfer DNA into eukaryotic cells. Advantages and disadvantages  The advantages of reverse transfection (over conventional transfection) are: *The addition and attachment of target cells to the DNA-loaded surface can lead to a higher probability of cell-DNA contact, potentially leading to higher transfection efficiency.Erfle, H. et al. (2007), \\"Reverse transfection on cell arrays for high content screening\\". Microscopy, Nat Protoc 2, 392‚Äì399 *Labour-saving materials (less DNA is required) *High-throughput screening; hundreds of genes may be expressed in cells on a single microarray for studying gene expression and regulation.Neumann B et al., \\"High-throughput RNAi screening by time-lapse imaging of live human cells\\". Nat Methods 3, 385‚Äì390 (2006). *Parallel cell seeding in a single chamber for 384 experiments, with no physical separation between experiments, increases screening data quality. Well-to-well variations occur in experiments performed in multi-wall dishes. *Exact-replicate arrays may be produced, since the same sample source plate may be dried and printed on different slides for at least 15 months' storage without apparent loss of transfection efficiency. The disadvantages of reverse transfection are: *Reverse transfection is more expensive because a highly accurate and efficient microarray printing system is needed to print the DNA-gelatin solution onto the slides. *Applications with different cell lines have (so far) required protocol variations to manufacture siRNA or plasmid arrays, which involve considerable development and testing. *Increased possibility of array-spot cross-contamination as spot density increases; therefore, optimization of the array layout is important.Cancer Cell Lines and Primary Cells Retrieved 2011-10-14.

It was the basis for the 826 National organization, which has centers on the United States with the same goal. Overview Named for its street address, 826 Valencia was founded in 2002 by author Dave Eggers and veteran teacher N√≠nive Calegari, who both have ties to the literary and educational community. 826 consists of three centers, each encompassing a writing lab, a street-front student-friendly store that partially funds the programs, and two satellite classrooms in nearby middle schools. The organization is named after the street address of the first center. Over 1,400 volunteers‚Äîincluding published authors, magazine founders, SAT-course instructors, and documentary filmmakers‚Äîhave donated their time to work with thousands of students. These volunteers allow 826 Valencia to offer all of its services for free. 826 Valencia opened a second location in the Tenderloin in 2016 and another in the Mission Bay neighborhood in 2019. Programming 826 Valencia's programming includes-in-schools programs, workshops, field trips, after school tutoring and student publishing. Pirate supply store The storefront for 826 Valencia's pirate supply store with a sign reading \\"I'm a pirate and I'm with Coco!\\" 826 Valencia runs San Francisco's \\"only independent pirate supply store\\". The store is the front entrance of the tutoring center and has the look and feel of an authentic pirate shop. It sells pirate clothing, eyepatches, compasses, spyglasses, pirate dice, skull flags, and secret treasures. It features handmade signs, scattered around the store, offering tongue-in-cheek wisdom, such as \\"Uses for Lard\\" (#5: \\"Lard Fights\\") and \\"Guidelines for New Shipmates\\" (#4: \\"No forgetting to swab\\"). Unsuspecting visitors are sometimes treated to surprise \\"moppings.\\" Shoppers can also find back issues of McSweeney's Quarterly Concern, books published by McSweeney's, and literary compilations written by 826 Valencia students. The books of student writing published by 826 Valencia include forewords, illustrations and interviews from public figures such as Former San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom and actor Robin Williams. The Pirate Supply Store was originally created through necessity. After being turned down for regular use of church basements and school facilities, the founders discovered an empty store on Valencia Street. City ordinances required businesses in that area of the city to be either retail or catering, so the Pirate Supply Store was opened in 2002 as the \\"legitimate\\" business front for the writing center. It also helps fund the tutoring program. Mural Dave Eggers commissioned cartoonist Chris Ware to design the mural for the facade of 826 Valencia's building. The mural depicts \\"the parallel development of humans and their efforts at and motivations for communication, spoken and written.\\" The 3.9m x 6m mural was applied by artisans to Ware's specifications. Describing the work, Ware said \\"I didn‚Äôt want it to make anyone 'feel good', especially in that typically muralistic 'hands across the water' sort of way,\\"...\\"I especially wanted it to be something that people living in the neighbourhood could look at day after day and hopefully not tire of too quickly. I really hoped whomever might happen to come across it would find something that showed a respect for their intelligence, and didn‚Äôt force-feed them any 'message'.\\" Influence 826 Valencia has inspired a number of other projects across the US, known as 'chapters'. In late 2004, just before the founding of four new chapters, 826 National was launched as an umbrella organization that provides logistical support to its chapters. There are now nine chapters that make up 826 National: 826 Valencia, 826NYC in Brooklyn, 826LA in Los Angeles, 826CHI in Chicago, 826michigan (serving Ann Arbor, Detroit, and Ypsilanti), 826 Boston in Boston, 826DC in Washington, DC, 826 New Orleans, and most recently, 826 MSP in Minneapolis. 826 Valencia has also inspired similar projects in several countries: United States * 826NYC, New York - Opened 2004 * 826LA, Los Angeles - Opened 2005 * The Greater Seattle Bureau of Fearless Ideas (formerly 826 Seattle), Seattle - Opened 2005 * 826 Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan - Opened 2005 * 826CHI, Chicago - Opened 2005 * 826 Boston, Boston - Opened 2007 * 826DC, Washington, D.C. - Opened 2010 * Desert Island Supply Co., Birmingham, AL - Opened 2012 * 826 New Orleans, New Orleans - Opened 2018 * 826 MSP, Minneapolis - Opened 2009, inducted into the 826 network in 2019 Canada * Story Planet, Toronto - Opened 2011 Italy * La Grande Fabbrica delle Parole, Milano (MI) - Opened 2009 * Porto delle Storie, Campi Bisenzio (FI) - Opened 2014 * Fronte del Borgo, Torino (TO) - Opened 2016 United Kingdom * The Ministry of Stories, London - Opened 2010 * Grimm & Co, Rotherham, Yorkshire Australia * The Sydney Story Factory ‚Äì founded in 2011 * 100 Story Building, Melbourne - Opened 2012 Sweden * Ber√§ttarministeret (Ministry of Tales) - founded in 2011 with several locations in the Stockholm area, and since 2017 one location in Gothenburg Ireland * Fighting Words, Dublin - Opened 2009 Austria * W*ORT, Lustenau - Opened 2014 France * [Labo des Histoires, Paris - Opened 2011 Netherlands * Noordje, Amsterdam Other In April 2010, as an extension of the 826 Valencia scholarship program, Eggers launched ScholarMatch, a nonprofit organization that connects donors with students to make college more affordable.

It is used to determine the best candidate to fill a specific role within the company. Most companies provide such forms to anyone upon request, at which point it becomes the responsibility of the applicant to complete the form and return it to the employer for consideration. The completed and returned document notifies the company of the applicant's availability and desire to be employed as well as their qualifications and background so that a determination can be made as to the candidate's suitability to the position. A job application letter dated January 1, 1913 Rejection letter dated January 16, 1913 Forged rejection letter for Albert Einstein, \\"1907\\" Definition From the employer's perspective, the application serves a number of purposes. These vary depending on the nature of the job and the preferences of the person responsible for hiring, as \\"each organization should have an application form that reflects its own environment\\".Diane Arthur, Recruiting, Interviewing, Selecting & Orienting New Employees (1998), p. 111. At a minimum, an application usually requires the applicant to provide information sufficient to demonstrate that he or she is legally permitted to be employed. The typical application also requires the applicant to provide information regarding relevant skills, education, and experience (previous employment or volunteer work). The application itself is a minor test of the applicant's literacy, penmanship, and communication skills. A careless job applicant might disqualify themselves with a poorly filled-out application. The application may also require the applicant to disclose any criminal record and to provide information sufficient to enable the employer to conduct an appropriate background check. For a business that employs workers on a part-time basis, the application may inquire as to the applicant's availability at specific times and/or days and preferences in this regard. Employers may be prohibited from asking applicants about characteristics that are not relevant to the job, such as their political view or sexual orientation.Diane Arthur, Recruiting, Interviewing, Selecting & Orienting New Employees (1998), p. 111.Donald H. Weiss, Fair, Square & Legal: Safe Hiring, Managing & Firing Practices to Keep You and Your Company Out of Court (2004), p. 45. For white collar jobs, particularly those requiring communication skills, the employer will typically require applicants to accompany the form with a cover letter and a r√©sum√©.Sandra Bunting, The Interviewer's Handbook: Successful Interviewing Techniques for the Workplace (2005), p. 82. However, even employers who accept a cover letter and r√©sum√© will frequently also require the applicant to complete an application form, as the other documents may neglect to mention specific details of importance to the employer.Diane Arthur, Recruiting, Interviewing, Selecting & Orienting New Employees (1998), p. 168.Joe Kennedy, The Small Business Owner's Manual (2005), p. 122. In some instances, an application is effectively used to dissuade \\"walk-in\\" applicants, serving as a barrier between the applicant and a job interview with the person who has the authority to hire.Diane Arthur, Recruiting, Interviewing, Selecting & Orienting New Employees (1998), p. 59. For many businesses, applications for employment can be filled out online, rather than submitted in person. However, it is still recommended that applicants bring a printed copy of their application to an interview.A C \\"Buddy\\" Krizan, Patricia Merrier, Joyce P. Logan, Business Communication (2010), p. 551. Application forms are the second most common hiring instrument next to personal interviews. Companies will occasionally use two types of application forms, short and long. They help companies with initial screening . The answers that applicants choose to submit are helpful to the company because they can potentially become an interview question for that applicant. Standardization and regulation The employment application is not a standardized form, so every company may create its own as long as regulations set by the government are adhered to. Document elements At a minimum, applications usually ask the applicant for their name, phone number, and address. In addition, applications may also ask for previous employment information, educational background, emergency contacts, and references, as well as any special skills the applicant might have. The three categories of information that application fields are very useful for discovering are physical characteristics, experience, and environmental factors. =Physical characteristics= If the company has a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ) to ask regarding a physical condition, they may ask questions about it. For example: : The job requires a lot of physical labor. Do you have any physical problems that may interfere with this job? =Experience= Experience requirements can be separated into two groups on an application: work experience and educational background. Educational background is important because it allows a potential employer to evaluate an applicants' performance in school as well as make determinations as to personality and intelligence. Work experience is important because it will inform a potential employer if the applicant meets their specific needs. Companies are usually interested when applicants were unemployed, when/why the applicant left their previous job and their highest position at their previous job. =Socio- environmental qualifications= Companies may be interested in the applicant's social environment because it can inform them of their personality, interests, and qualities. For example, if they are extremely active within an organization, that may demonstrate their ability to communicate well with others. Being in management may demonstrate their leadership ability as well as their determination. =Photograph= Customs vary from country to country when it comes to the inclusion or non-inclusion of a photograph of the applicant. In many English-speaking countries, notably the United States, this is not customary, and books or websites giving recommendations about how to design an application typically advise against it unless explicitly requested by the employer., accessed 28 December 2013. In other countries (for instance, Germany), the inclusion of a photograph of the applicant is still common, and many employers would consider an application incomplete without it. In other non-English speaking European countriesFrance= In France, the requires companies with more than 50 employees to request an anonymous application ('). =Germany= The job application is called Bewerbung in Germany and usually consists of three parts: the Anschreiben (cover letter), the Lebenslauf (curriculum vitae (CV)) and the Zeugnisse (references). The Anschreiben is used to convince the employer to submit an invitation for a job interview. It must be in paper size DIN A4, not exceed one page, a handwritten signature, and accompanied by a Lebenslauf and Zeugnisse. The Lebenslauf is documented in reverse chronological order and should give information on work experience, education and professional training as well as an applicant's skills. In Germany, the Lebenslauf usually includes a photograph called Bewerbungsfoto. Some employers, mainly governmental organisations, deliberately neglect the photograph to ensure a higher degree of objectivity in the course of assessment procedures. The Lebenslauf should be two pages long. In general, there are two options of submitting a job application in Germany: a job application folder (Bewerbungsmappe) or online (Onlinebewerbung). According to a study, the Onlinebewerbung was more favored in Germany than the Bewerbungsmappe by 2012. =Italy= The CV is the most important part of the application and should not be longer than two to three pages. It is divided into three areas: in chronological order: * Personal details (Informazioni personal) * School and education (Studi e Formazione) in reverse chronological order: * Additional capabilities/skills (Altre conoscenze) * Experience (Esperienze professional). As a graduate, this section is omitted. Brief information on the application motivations may be mentioned here. The cover letter (La Lettera di accompagnamento al curriculum) is relatively short, polite and formal in Italian applications. Long versions and extensively explained motivations, as well as photos and copies of certificates, are presented only at the interview. =Spain= In Spain, the application consists of two parts: the cover letter (Carta de Candidatura) and the CV. No work or training certificates are attached. The cover letter should be short and contain the reason for applying. The CV should be structured in a tabular form. In Spain, multiple job interviews with the same company are common. Usage by hackers Job applications are known to be used by hackers to get employees to open attachments or links or connect USB sticks with malware. As companies typically have more financial resources than private individuals, they are often a target of cyberextortion. Ransomware such as \\"Petya\\" and \\"GoldenEye\\" were discovered to exploit job applications. Cyberespionage and attacks on critical infrastructure-related companies may be other reasons for such attacks and other than ransomware attacks may leave employees in the dark about their computer or network infection. The best method for mitigating such risks would be to have the HR department use a separate computer for job applications that is entirely disconnected from the internal network, on which no confidential or valuable information is stored and to which no portable devices such as USB sticks that may get connected to other computers of the company are connected.

The type of beads that are involved in the SPA are microscopic in size and within the beads itself, there is a scintillant which emits light when it is stimulated. Stimulation occurs when radio-labelled molecules interact and bind to the surface of the bead. This interaction will trigger the bead to emit light, which can be detected using a photometer.  Overview  The SPA technique is dependent on the energy conversion of radioactive decay, which releases light photons which can be detected via the use of some devices such as the photomultiplier tubes of scintillation counters or CCD imagers. This is a very popular technique in practices that require detecting and quantifying radioactivity.Homogeneous Proximity Tyrosine Kinase Assays: Scintillation Proximity Assay versus Homogeneous Time-Resolved Fluorescence. Analytical Biochemistry Volume 269, Issue 1, 10 April 1999, Pages 94-104. The process of converting radioactivity to light requires a liquid medium of scintillation combination consisting soluble organic scintillators and organic solvents. During the process of radioactive decay, a beta particle will be released. While this particle travels in the medium, the energy it possesses is dissipated as it collides with the surrounding molecules in the solvent, exciting them while doing so. The excited molecules will transfer the energy they now possess to the scintillator molecules, where the energy will be emitted as light.  Detail  In more detail, when the radio-labelled molecule is attached or is in proximity to bead, light emission is stimulated. However, if the bead does not become bound to the radio-labelled molecule, the bead will not be stimulated to emit light. This is because the energy released from the unbound molecule is not strong enough to excite the SPA bead which is not then stimulated to produce a signal. The decay of radioactive atom releases electrons as one of the subatomic particles. The energy of these particles influences the distance travelled by the particles itself through a medium such as water. This influence of the energy or the limitation of the water is what this SPA method is dependent upon. For instance, the decay of a Tritium atom releases a beta particle. Tritium is highly recommended as it suits SPA very well. It is due to the 1.5 ¬µm path length through water, which is very short. So, when the √ü-particle is within that particular range of 1.5 ¬µm with the scintillant bead, there is sufficient energy to stimulate the bead to emit light. If the distance between them is greater than 1.5 ¬µm, then the √ü-particle is incapable of travelling the required distance to stimulate the bead as it has insufficient energy. The beads in SPA are formed from the incorporation of scintillant into small beads known as fluomicrospheres. These are specially designed to bind with specific molecules. When the bead is in close proximity to the radioactive molecule, light is stimulated. The photonmultiplier tube (PMT) can be used to detect the emitted photons. This device converts the emitted photon energy into electrical energy by a photocathode via a series of other electrodes. Another device is known as CCD Imager, which is composed of a set of cooled digital cameras with sensitive charge coupled device detectors and with some refined telecentric lenses to convert the captured photon energy into high quality images. There is also an assortment of bead coatings available that allows this method to be applied to a broad range of applications, such as enzyme assays and radio-immuno assays.  Advantages over previous methods  In comparison to the previous over-coated plate-based methods, SPA has a number of advantages that makes it more popular: *Assay flexibility - the concentration of the components in the assay can be adjusted to suit the user due to the higher surface area design of the SPA beads, hence providing the user flexibility in designing assay. *Radioactive label reduction - the SPA beads allows a potential reduction in the quantity of radioactive labeling required due to its higher binding capacity, which gives a higher signal. This method also allows the user to optimize the sensitivity of the assay by altering the quantity of SPA beads. *Convenient - the key component of the SPA assay, the beads, do not depend on a particular plate type or supplier, hence its wide availability. *Bead assortment - there is a diversity of bead types to choose from to suit the need of the user and application. *No separation step - allows binding measurement without separation step associated with earlier methods, which reduces errors and allows higher throughput.

Most of his life was spent in London. Biography He was born in Edinburgh, but after beginning his library career in Glasgow, he subsequently moved to London, and worked in Clerkenwell for the Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury. He devised three classification systems: Quinn/Brown (1898), Adjustable classification (1898) and Subject Classification (1906). The latter system was for municipal libraries and was informed by his advocacy of open shelf access of books in the UK. Indeed, he was [t]he pioneer of this new system [while he was librarian] of Clerkenwell, where the first experiment in open access was launched in May, 1893. This was referred to as \\"safe guarded open access\\". Alongside his classification work, he produced a standard textbook on librarianship (the Manual of Library Economy). In 1898 he was threatened with a libel action by Charles Goss, over a polemic defending open access, and he was forced to apologise. He further contributed to theoretical journals and also produced correspondence courses in librarianship \\"upon which most British librarians depended for their professional studies until the 1930s\\". As Librarian in the Metropolitan Borough of Islington he largely built up their collection and service. Ideas His work in classification attempted to deal with the problem of the shelf arrangement of interdisciplinary works, and how to ensure that works on the same topic would be found in the same place. Part of his attempt to deal with this was to create synthesised notation (a rarity among classification systems in his day) to allow composite classmarks to be created. Clare Beghtol notes He tried to bring all works on a concrete topic together notationally so that, for example, \\"at E917 for Coffee must be collected everything related to coffee, regardless of standpoint, form or other qualification but it must not be put under such headings as Tropical Agriculture, Beverages, Crops, Foods, Drugs, Ethics, Bibliography, Customs, or any other general head.\\" Publications *1886: Biographical Dictionary of Musicians *1893: Guide to the Formation of a Music Library *1897: British Musical Biography with Stephen Samuel Stratton *1898: Manual of Library Classification and Shelf Arrangement *1903: Manual of Library Economy (7 later eds.) *1906: Manual of Practical Bibliography *1906: Subject Classification (1st ed. 1906 ; 2nd ed. 1914 ; 3rd ed.

Course and features Underneath Hobart on the lower rivulet The rivulet rises on the slopes of Mount Wellington and flows generally northeast over O'Grady's Falls, Strickland Falls, through South Hobart and past what was known as the World Heritage-listed Cascades Female Factory towards the Hobart central business district. As a result of urban development, the natural course has been altered significantly. The lower portion of the rivulet has been piped through the city and runs below the central city area. The rivulet emerges again near the Royal Hobart Hospital on Collins Street before flowing underneath the Cenotaph and emptying into the Derwent. The rivulet descends over its course.

Because of the pure water of the upper portion of the rivulet, the Cascade Brewery was built beside it. There were several typhoid epidemics during the late 19th century due to poor water quality further downstream. It was also an important source of energy for early industry in Hobart.

P. Russell, Sub-Coelum: A Sky-Built Human World, Boston, Houghton Mifflin, 1893. The book is one volume in the large body of utopian, dystopian, and speculative literature that characterized the later nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.Kenneth Roemer, The Obsolete Necessity, 1888-1900, Kent, OH, Kent State University Press, 1976.Francine Cary, Shaping the Future in the Gilded Age: A Study of Utopian Thought, 1888-1900, Madison, WI, University of Wisconsin Press, 1975. Genre Scholar of the genre Jean Pfaelzer has described Sub-Coelum as a \\"conservative utopia,\\" a book written in reaction to the multiple radical implications of the utopian fiction of Edward Bellamy and similar writers. While some skeptics of utopianism responded with dystopian satires and parodies, others, like Russell, answered with speculative fictions of their own that defended more conservative values. (Pfaelzer places John Macnie's The Diothas and John Jacob Astor IV's A Journey in Other Worlds in the same category.)Jean Pfaelzer, The Utopian Novel in America, 1886-1896: The Politics of Form, Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh Press, 1984; pp. 172-3; see also pp. 95-111. Sub- Coelum has been called \\"a protest against the materialistic and socialistic tendencies of the times.\\"\\"D. O.,\\" \\"In Memoriam,\\" The Bookman, Vol. 37 (1913), p. 545. Form Sub-Coelum has been termed a novel, for want of a better classification -- though it is that unusual type of novel that has no plot or characters. It might more accurately be called a fantasy or a meditation on society and human affairs. The book is divided into 146 short chapters; most are a page or two in length. The style is sometimes elaborate and eloquently descriptive: :\\"Every flying and creeping thing had its enthusiasts and exponents. Ephemera, infusoria, animalculae, were classified and individualized, without limit. Microbes, bacilli, were pets of the imagination. Children, even, seemed familiar with the monsters of the microscope, and talked of them as glibly as of their playthings and the chemical elements.\\"Sub-Coelum, p. 20. It can also be pithy and aphoristic: \\"Sarcasm was not often indulged, and only then between close friends.\\" At some points the prose rises to a pitch of ecstasy or delirium: :\\"Light and heat were obtained almost entirely from water....Exalting tonics and enrapturing odors were diffused through the atmosphere at pleasure. Talent expended itself in producing essences and tinctures and stimulants of paradisaic delicacy to be so employed. On great occasions the light produced rivaled that of the sun. The whole atmosphere seemed to be aflame. The effect was magical. The smallest thing was made visible, and all things were beautified in appearance. Men appeared more manly and women more lovely.\\"Sub-Coelum, pp. 95-6. Some critics complained about the book; a Yale reviewer noted its \\"vagueness and indefiniteness....\\"The Yale Literary Magazine, Vol. 59 (November 1893), p. 103. Russell's imagined land has been grouped with \\"Altruria, Equitania...or even Meccania\\"G. Stanley Hall, \\"The Message of the Zeitgeist,\\" The Scientific Monthly, Vol. 13 (1921), p. 106. (the fantasy countries of William Dean Howells, Walter O. Henry, and Owen Gregory respectively). Moral matters Pfaelzer calls Sub-Coelum \\"an early behaviorist utopia....\\"Pfaelzer, p. 102. There is much \\"individuality\\" in Russell's projected social order, but little privacy; the people are close observers of each other. Artists who offend are jailed. Russell places a high value on sexual restraint. \\"Purity, of all things, was most jealously guarded. The incorrigibly impure were locked up forever. Men and women, as to that, were treated alike by the police and by the courts.\\"Sub-Coelum, p. 61. To obtain a marriage license, a couple must answer a long series of questions, under oath. On the positive side, material and mechanical progress continue; the workday is shortened, and extremes of wealth and poverty are leveled out. Even racism is overcome. Surprisingly for the era of Jim Crow and anti-miscegenation laws, Russell appears to endorse inter-racial marriage: \\"Race prejudices gradually gave way, and bigotries. Fibres intermingled and blood interfused. Distinctions were obliterated by intermarriage.\\"Sub-Coelum, p. 114. As with race, so with gender: Russell's moralizing and idealizing tendency produces an unexpected result. \\"Men, many of them, changed places with women, and became essentially domestic. Household duties, in a great degree, had passed into their hands. They discovered a fondness for them, as to the other sex they became distasteful.\\" \\"As far as possible woman was emancipated from menial duties.\\" The country's doctors are women.Sub-Coelum, pp. 245, 248. Russell consistently contrasts the past of Sub-Coelum, when things were less good, with the happier present. In the past, the nation may have had inferior clergy, and corrupt lawyers, and vain and foolish social customsSub-Coelum, pp. 43-8, 48-50, 68-70, 110-12. -- but moral reformation has brought about improvement. In this way, Russell contrasts actual aspects of American culture in his age, with his vision of how things should be. In Russell's imaginary country, \\"The vices, in a great measure, had been eliminated, or had died out.\\" This includes alcohol abuse and tobacco, gambling and prize fighting. \\"Increase of common sense and practical wisdom was a marked result of the new life.\\"Sub-Coelum, pp. 76, 79. Yet (with the vagueness cited by the Yale critic) Russell never explains how this renovation in human nature comes about. Eccentricities Russell also loads his fantasia with a fair share of oddities. The people of Sub-Coelum slaughter their chickens humanely, with guillotines. They keep \\"intelligent monkeys,\\" along with monkey hospitals and monkey temples. They add trees and shrubs to the native forests, \\"to give greater variety.\\" Squirrels are domesticated. Cemeteries are the most beautiful places in the sky-built land, and birds are lured into nesting on the graves. Snoring, whistling, and bell-ringing have been banished from society. The Sub-Coelumites have exceptionally good teeth; they train their pigs to eat in moderation. The book is full of animals. In addition to the squirrels and monkeys, Russell includes passages on bees, butterflies, dogs, horses, orangutans, snakes, insects, and microscopic life. A ten-page chapter, the book's longest, extols the amazing qualities of rats.

He was elected as an anti-Treaty Sinn F√©in Teachta D√°la (TD) to the 3rd D√°il at the 1922 general election for the Monaghan constituency but did not take his seat because of the absentionist policy of Sinn F√©in. He was re-elected at the 1923 general election and once again did not take his seat. He was elected as a Fianna F√°il TD at the June 1927 general election and took his seat on 12 August 1927 along with the other Fianna F√°il TDs. He did not contest the September 1927 general election. MacCarvill studied at University College Dublin (UCD) and was a medical doctor, as was his son. Prior to being fully qualified MacCarvill helped in training of members of Cumann na mBan after the 1916 Easter Rising and during the Irish War of Independence in first aid in Harcourt Street, along with Dr Kathleen Lynn and Dr Geraghty. During his time in UCD he played Gaelic football winning the Sigerson Cup medals in 1917 and 1918. He also played soccer which caused him difficulties with the GAA in the College. His selection as candidate for the 1922 general election was controversial since the anti-Treaty side selected MacCarvill instead of Se√°n MacEntee. The pro-Treaty side claimed this breached the electoral pact which would have resulted in two pro-Treaty and one anti-Treaty candidates being elected without a contest. As a result of the selection of MacCarvill, the pro-Treaty side stood an independent candidate Thomas McHugh which forced an election. MacCarvill duly was elected.1922 General Election - Irish History Studies by Michael Gallagher, www.tcd.ie MacCarvill unsuccessfully stood at the 1948 general election in Monaghan for Clann na Poblachta.

The line was passed in an Act of Parliament in 1903 but work did not commence until 5 years later. Built mostly on embankment it opened in 1910. It was brought into use following the opening of Wath marshalling yard in 1907, and in preparation for the opening of Immingham Dock in 1912. The Doncaster Avoiding Line runs from Bentley Junction on the Doncaster to Hull/Cleethorpes line to Hexthorpe Junction on the Doncaster to Sheffield line. It is double track throughout with Bentley Junction being a 'flyover' junction and Hexthorpe Junction a 'flat' junction. The only junction in between was Sprotborough Junction, opened in 1916, where connections were made with the Hull and Barnsley and Great Central Joint Railway. These were two sets of 'double cross-overs' with the signal box between. The line was worked under permissive block regulations, but these were suspended when passenger trains were to work over the line and absolute block substituted. There was a rising gradient towards Hexthorpe Junction which if trains were heavy and had been stood in the queue from Sprotborough Junction a banking locomotive was provided. This came from Mexborough depot and was usually a J11, N5 or L3 but sometimes a G.C.\\"Fish\\" engine which was on shed at the time. This locomotive also was used on the \\"Top Yard\\" to York Road goods and when it was away from its post Doncaster's passenger pilot locomotive would deputise if required The line is still open and fulfils its original purpose, even more important today with faster trains on the East Coast Main Line in both freight and passenger.

Aviation Week & Space Technology, Aug 28, pp. 66‚Äì68. The professed advantage of flight envelope protection systems is that they restrict a pilot's excessive control inputs, whether in surprise reaction to emergencies or otherwise, from translating into excessive flight control surface movements. Notionally, this allows pilots to react quickly to an emergency while blunting the effect of an excessive control input resulting from \\"startle,\\" by electronically limiting excessive control surface movements that could over-stress the airframe and endanger the safety of the aircraft.Waldrop MM. (1989). Flying the Electric Skies. Science, 244: 1532‚Äì1534. Alizart R. Fulford GA. (1989) Electric Airliners. Science, 245: 581‚Äì583. In practice, these limitations have sometimes resulted in unintended human factors errors and accidents of their own. Function Aircraft have a flight envelope that describes its safe performance limits in regard to such things as minimum and maximum operating speeds, and its operating structural strength. Flight envelope protection calculates that flight envelope (and adds a margin of safety) and uses this information to stop pilots from making control inputs that would put the aircraft outside that flight envelope. The interference of the flight envelope protection system with the pilot's commands can happen in two different ways (which can also be combined): * Ignoring part or all of an control input that would bring an aircraft's state of flight closer to or even outside of its operational borders. This method is applied in most sidestick-controlled fly- by-wire aircraft with rate command. * Inform the pilot that the respective command is bringing the aircraft closer to the calculated operational borders; this communication can happen by simple alarms or tactile feedback. This method is often applied in aircraft with conventional controls. For example, if the pilot uses the rearward side-stick to pitch the aircraft nose up, the control computers creating the flight envelope protection can prevent the pilot pitching the aircraft beyond the stalling angle of attack: *In the first case, if the pilot tries to apply even more rearward control, the flight envelope protection would cause the aircraft to ignore this command. Flight envelope protection can in this way increase aircraft safety by allowing the pilot to apply maximum control forces in an emergency while not at the same time inadvertently putting the aircraft outside the margins of its operational safety. Examples of where this might stop air accidents are when it allows a pilot to make a quick evasive maneuver in response to a ground proximity warning system warning, or in quick response to an approaching aircraft and a potential mid air collision. In this case without a flight envelope protection system, \\"you would probably hold back from maneuvering as hard as you could for fear of tumbling out of control, or worse. You would have to sneak up on it [2.5 G, the design limit], and when you got there you wouldn't be able to tell, because very few commercial pilots have ever flown 2.5 G. But in the A320, you wouldn't have to hesitate: you could just slam the controller all the way to the side and instantly get out of there as fast as the plane will take you.\\" Thus the makers of the Airbus argue: \\"envelope protection doesn't constrain the pilot. It liberates the pilot from uncertainty ‚Äì and thus enhances safety.\\" *In the second case, e.g. when using a force-feedback-system to communicate with the pilot, if the pilot tries to apply even more rearward control, the flight envelope protection would present increasing counterforces on the controls so that the pilot has to apply increasing force in order to continue the control input that is perceived as dangerous by the flight envelope protection. While most designers of modern fly-by-wire aircraft stick to either one of these to solutions ('sidestick-control & no feedback' or 'conventional control & feedback', see also below), there are also approaches in science to combine both of them: As a study demonstrated, force-feedback applied to the side-stick of an aircraft controlled via role rate and g-load (as e.g. an modern Airbus aircraft) can be used to increase adherence to a save flight envelope and thus reduce the risk of pilots entering dangerous states of flights outside the operational borders while maintaining the pilots' final authority and increasing their situation awareness.  Airbus and Boeing  The Airbus A320 was the first commercial aircraft to incorporate full flight-envelope protection into its flight-control software. This was instigated by former Airbus senior vice president for engineering Bernard Ziegler. In the Airbus, the flight envelope protection cannot be overridden completely, although the crew can fly beyond flight envelope limits by selecting an alternate \\"control law\\".Traverse P.

Boeing in the Boeing 777 has taken a different approach by allowing the crew to override flight envelope limits using excessive force on the flight controls.Aplin JD. (1997). Primary flight computers for the Boeing 777. Microprocessors and Microsystems. 20: 473‚Äì478. IncidentsChina Airlines Flight 006= One objection raised against flight envelope protection is the incident that happened to China Airlines Flight 006, a Boeing 747SP-09, northwest of San Francisco in 1985. In this flight incident, the crew was forced to overstress (and structurally damage) the horizontal tail surfaces in order to recover from a roll and near-vertical dive. (This had been caused by an automatic disconnect of the autopilot and incorrect handling of a yaw brought about by an engine flame-out). The pilot recovered control with about 10,000 ft of altitude remaining (from its original high-altitude cruise). But to do that the pilot had to pull the aircraft with an estimated 5.5 G, or more than twice its design limits. Had the aircraft incorporated a flight envelope protection system, this excessive manoeuvre could not have been performed, greatly reducing chances of recovery. Against this objection, Airbus has responded that an A320 in the situation of Flight 006 \\"never would have fallen out of the air in the first place: the envelope protection would have automatically kept it in level flight in spite of the drag of a stalled engine\\". =FedEx Flight 705= FedEx Flight 705, in April 1995, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30, was a case of a FedEx Flight Engineer who, facing a dismissal, attempted to hijack the plane and crash it into FedEx Headquarters in order for his family to collect his life insurance policy. After being attacked and severely injured, the flight crew was able to fight back and land the plane safely. In order to keep the attacker off balance and out of the cockpit the crew had to perform extreme maneuvers, including a barrel roll and a dive so fast the airplane couldn't measure its airspeed. Had the crew not been able to exceed the plane's flight envelope, the crew might not have been successful . =American Airlines Flight 587= American Airlines Flight 587, an Airbus A300, crashed in November 2001, when the vertical stabilizer broke off due to excessive rudder inputs made by the pilot. A flight-envelope protection system could have prevented this crash, though it can still be argued that an override button should be provided for contingencies when the pilots are aware of the need to exceed normal limits. =US Airways Flight 1549= US Airways Flight 1549, an Airbus A320, experienced a dual engine failure after a bird strike and subsequently landed safely in the Hudson River in January 2009. The NTSB accident reporthttps://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/AAR1003.pdf in particular section 1.6.3 and 2.7.2 mentions the effect of flight envelope protection: \\"The airplane‚Äôs airspeed in the last 150 feet of the descent was low enough to activate the alpha-protection mode of the airplane‚Äôs fly-by-wire envelope protection features... Because of these features, the airplane could not reach the maximum angle of attack (AoA) attainable in pitch normal law for the airplane weight and configuration; however, the airplane did provide maximum performance for the weight and configuration at that time... The flight envelope protections allowed the captain to pull full aft on the sidestick without the risk of stalling the airplane.\\" = Qantas Flight 72 = Qantas 72 had suffered an uncommanded pitch-down due to erroneous data from one of its ADIRU computers. =Air France Flight 447= Air France Flight 447, an Airbus A330, entered an aerodynamic stall from which it did not recover and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in June 2009 killing all aboard. Temporary inconsistency between measured speeds, likely a result of the obstruction of the pitot tubes by ice crystals, caused autopilot disconnection and reconfiguration to alternate law; a second consequence of the reconfiguration into alternate law was that stall protection no longer operated. The crew made inappropriate control inputs that caused the aircraft to stall and did not recognize that the aircraft had stalled. = MCAS on the Boeing 737 MAX = In October 2018 and again in March 2019, the MCAS flight protection system's erroneous activation pushed two Boeing 737 MAX airliners into an unrecoverable dive, killing 346 people and resulting in the worldwide grounding of the airliner.
