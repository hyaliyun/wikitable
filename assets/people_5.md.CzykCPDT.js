It would typically be used on a workbench. A plank or board with edges planed flat is called a shot edge board. There are two specific purposes to which shooting boards are applied: jointing and end grain trimming. The design of the shooting board remains fundamentally the same in both cases but the length of the board will vary - with the boards used for jointing being much longer than those intended for end grain trimming. A shooting board consists of a flat board, the base, with a stop at one end, similar to a bench hook, on which the board to be planed is rested. The stop prevents the board from sliding as it is planed. Parallel to the base and slightly lower is a secondary surface, the fence, which may be a separate board, or may be a rabbet cut into the base. The difference in height between the base and the fence is to allow for the offset of the blade in the hand plane. The purpose of the fence is to guide the plane along the edge of the board being planed such that the blade in the plane is presented at 90 degrees to the base of the shooting board. Assuming that the sides of the hand plane being used are perpendicular to the sole, this ensures an edge that is at 90 degrees to the face of the board. For end grain trimming, the board is placed on the shooting board so that an edge adjacent to the end to be trimmed is hard against the stop. The woodworker will usually have scribed a line on the end to indicate how far to trim the board. The hand plane is rested on its side on the fence and held firmly against the end of the board whilst being pushed along its length. Jointing is performed the same way except that the board is oriented so that one end is against the stop and the edge to be jointed faces the fence. One problem faced when using shooting boards repetitively is that the blade in the hand plane becomes worn very quickly in one spot. This requires frequent sharpening to ensure smooth and accurate cutting. The ramped shooting board addresses this problem by introducing a slope to the fence. As the hand plane moves along the fence, the slope causes the part of the blade in contact with the board to move along the blade's length. This even exposure of wood along the whole blade allows a longer blade life, as sharpening is less frequent. Shooting boards can be made in various sizes and shapes to accommodate different tasks and it would not be uncommon to find a number of them in the workshop. One accessory that may be fitted to a shooting board is an angled stop, most commonly at 45 degrees. This allows mitres to be trimmed.

Birkenhead ferry wharf provides access to the area, as well as Victoria Road which has up to twenty bus services from the city to major centres further west. History In 1844 a salting and boiling down works was established by Charles Abercrombie. In 1900 the Perdriau Brothers set up a rubber importing company, which, as the automobile began to come into fashion, expanded their operation to manufacture rubber tyres. In 1929 Dunlop took over and by the 1960s, 1,600 employees produced tyres at the plant. In 1977 the plant closed down, and the site was redeveloped into a waterfront shopping centre. In the 1990s apartments were added, and the shops made way for designer clothing brand bargain outlet stores. Recent renovations of the shopping complex started in October 2004, and a new floor and glass roof was completed in November 2010.

IWSB was one of the first sports games to use multiple camera angles and present a three-dimensional (as opposed to two-dimensional) perspective. It was also the first statistics- based baseball simulation game on a video game console; all prior console baseball games were arcade-style recreations of the sport. The game's full formal title (due to licensing requirements) was Intellivision World Series Major League Baseball. It was typically shortened to World Series Baseball in use to differentiate it from the prior Mattel baseball game. History1980-1981= In the early 1980s, video games were based on models established either by coin-op games' scrolling playfields, or board games' static background images. The screen was either a stable field on which characters moved or a top-down (sometimes angled) display that scrolled horizontally, vertically or both ways across a larger virtual image. These restrictions were created by the limited memory size of early video game consoles, where a single screen would use up much of the RAM storage space available in a machine, and small video game cartridges that held only 4K (later 8K or 16K) of ROM memory. Daglow was one of the original five in-house Intellivision programmers at Mattel in 1980, and had written the first known computer baseball game, Baseball on a PDP-10 mainframe computer at Pomona College in . After completing his first Intellivision cartridge Utopia in 1981, he was promoted to lead the Intellivision game development team at Mattel. =1982= While watching a baseball game on TV in the spring of , Daglow realized that the Intellivision could mimic the same camera angles shown in the broadcast. He immediately wrote a proposal for a new baseball game. He received approval from group Vice President Gabriel Baum to start work. No current programmers were free, so Daglow began a search for someone qualified to create this new kind of game. He found the right person through the job placement office of his alma mater, Pomona College. Eddie Dombrower was a programmer, animator and classically trained dancer who had invented the DOM dance notation system on the Apple II computer as a way for choreographers to record dance moves the same way composers write down music. Since Intellivision World Series Baseball would require far better animations than past video games for its TV-style display, Dombrower was considered to be a perfect fit for the job. By October 1982 Dombrower had a first screen display running, complete with another first: an inset screen to show a runner taking his lead off of first base. This was the first use of an inset or picture-in- picture display in a video game. =1983= Baum and Daglow showed the prototype to Mattel's marketing department, which was locked in a TV advertising war with arch-rival Atari for the position of top video game console. Although the game was not slated for completion until mid-1983, the company rushed a new TV commercial into production for Christmas, in which Intellivision spokesman George Plimpton pulled a velvet drape from a monitor and proclaimed the title to be \\"the future of video games.\\" Mattel's marketing strategy was to dissuade consumers from buying Atari or Coleco consoles by showing an exclusive new style of Mattel game. The Video game crash of 1983 wiped out most of the market before Intellivision World Series Baseball ever shipped. Like most video games completed after the spring of 1983, it entered a toy store network that believed the video game era was over and that the games had been a passing fad. To make matters worse, while the game could be played without the use of the Intellivoice voice synthesizer (which was already being phased out due to poorer-than-expected sales and declining user interest), it did require the then-new Intellivision Entertainment Computer System (ECS) keyboard component. Unfortunately, by the time the ECS was released, an internal shake-up at the top levels of management had shifted the company's focus away from hardware add-ons and almost exclusively towards software. As a result, the ECS was not well-promoted, and neither it nor its companion software titles sold particularly well... and since IWSB was one of the last titles made for the ECS system, very few copies were sold, making it one of the rarest Intellivision titles in the collectors' market. Daglow and Dombrower went on to create the hit Earl Weaver Baseball game at Electronic Arts in , where they more fully implemented the ideas behind Intellivision World Series Baseball. This set the stage for the EA Sports product line. In the early and mid-1990s, Daglow led the development of the Tony La Russa Baseball games, further refining baseball simulations. Gameplay Intellivision World Series Baseball displayed the batter and pitcher from a \\"center field camera\\" view. One player chose the pitch type, while the player batting chose when to swing when to take a pitch, and whether or not to bunt. Once the ball was hit, the game switched to a \\"press box camera\\" view, where the defensive player could control the fielders and the batting player controlled the baserunners. When runners were on base an inset window displayed them, and the batting player could lengthen or shorten their lead and attempt to steal. The game was originally written with a simplified version of Daglow's 1971 mainframe baseball statistical simulation program, so that the MLBPA license could be acquired by Mattel and the game would accurately simulate the play of real Major League Baseball players. For economic reasons in mid-1983, Mattel withdrew from this plan at the last minute, and the designers were forced to replace actual players with the names of the Blue Sky Rangers Intellivision game design team. Intellivision World Series Baseball is also notable for the following innovations: *In-game play by play announcers, presented via Intellivoice *Stadium background music, created by Dave Warhol (who also worked on Earl Weaver Baseball at EA) *Save/load in a baseball game (through a RAM chip on the cartridge) *Lineups based on real player stats and skin colour (although names were changed) See also *Baseball mainframe computer game *Champion Baseball *Earl Weaver Baseball *Tony La Russa Baseball *Old Time Baseball References *List of top Intellivision games *Screen shots *Rielly, Edward J.

The site of the High School of Commerce from 1967 to 1990 is now home to the Adult High School. History A commerce program had begun at Ottawa Collegiate Institute in 1902. The program became quite popular, and in 1915 it had to move to temporary quarters at Hopewell Public School. In 1917 it moved to the new Ottawa Technical High School building, but officially remained an OCI program. In 1921 the commerce program was merged with the vocational program and both were administered by Ottawa Tech. Both the technical training and the commerce programs proved quite popular, and in 1929 the commerce program was moved to its own building, attached to the west of Glebe Collegiate Institute, and the High School of Commerce became Ottawa's fourth public high school. In 1967 the High School of Commerce moved to an even larger and newer facility on Rochester Street. This was considered an extremely modern facility, most notable for having an IBM 1401 computer on the third floor. Programs The school offered both a secretarial program and an extensive and intensive art program. The program was highly respected and afforded an excellent foundation in Fine Art, Textile Design, Theatre Arts, and Commercial and Graphic Arts. Graduates of the 4 year art program moved directly into art or craft programs at colleges and universities such as Mount Allison, The Ontario College of Art, Sheridan College, and Queens University. Most students were able to secure second-year standing on the strength of their experience at the High School of Commerce. However, enrollment in the commercial programs began to steadily decline as most students opted for the composite schools and demographics made for fewer young people. In 1983 part of the building was given to the adult education program. This program gradually grew and in 1990 the High School of Commerce was closed and the Adult High School took over. The art program transferred to Canterbury High School. References *Keith, Janet. The Collegiate Institute Board of Ottawa: A Short History, 1843-1969. Ottawa: Kent, 1969.

Concord West is located 16 km west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Canada Bay. Concord is a separate suburb, to the east. Concord West is bordered on the west by Rhodes, Liberty Grove and Homebush Bay; to the south by North Strathfield and Homebush; and to the east by Concord, Breakfast Point, Cabarita and Mortlake. It shares the postcode of 2138 with Rhodes. The suburb takes its namesake from the town of Concord, Massachusetts in the United States of America. History Concord takes its name from Concord, Massachusetts, in the United States. It was the site of the Battle of Concord, the first military engagements of the American Revolutionary War (1775‚Äì1778). Some historians believe the suburb was named Concord, to encourage a peaceful attitude between soldiers and settlers. The first land grants in the area were made in 1793.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, p.68 , page 286 Concord West was under the jurisdiction of Concord Council, until it amalgamated with Drummoyne Council in 2000 to form the City of Canada Bay. The surrounding parish is also named Concord Parish. A major historical figure in the area was Thomas Walker (1804‚Äì1886), a philanthropist who lived in the Victorian Italianate mansion, Yaralla, on the shores of Parramatta River. When he died, Walker left substantial funds for the establishment of a convalescent hospital in the area. The hospital‚Äîknown as the Thomas Walker Hospital‚Äîwas designed by Sir John Sulman in the Federation Free Classical style and built on a large site north-west of Yaralla. It is now listed on the Register of the National Estate. Since the late 1970s, it has functioned as Rivendell Child, Adolescent and Family Unit, which specialises in the treatment of young people with psychological problems. Walker's philanthropic work was continued by his daughter Dame Eadith Walker (1861‚Äì1937), who was awarded a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1919, and was made a Dame 1929.Parramatta River Walk, Department of Planning, New South Wales, 1989, p.16 The family home, Yaralla, eventually became the Dame Eadith Walker Hospital; like the Thomas Walker Hospital, it was listed on the Register of the National Estate.The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981, p.2/23 Dame Eadith also aided in establishing the Concord Repatriation General Hospital.

Cowan shares the postcode of 2081 with Berowra. Brooklyn, which lies to the north-east of Cowan, is considered the northernmost suburb of the Greater Sydney Metropolitan Area. History The town takes its name from an Aboriginal word meaning big water. The 1828 census lists two convicts called Cowan, and it is also thought possible that Cowan was named after one of them. Still another suggestion is that it was named after a small town in Scotland. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike Generic 2.0 license. Besides the English botanist George Caley, who explored the area in 1805, the first Europeans to visit the area were timber-getters. The timber from Cowan was used for coach building, one of the first industries in the area. The railway stop at Cowan was originally a crossing loop to allow trains on the single-line north track to pass each other, and it was also the point at which auxiliary steam engines, connected to the trains at Hawkesbury River station (Brooklyn), were disconnected after the steep haul to the top of the plateau. A station and platform were constructed in 1901. With the coming of the railway, Cowan become a popular holiday spot and a regular starting point for bushwalkers. Cowan Public School opened in 1939. In 1958, the rail line was electrified, and this also increased the number of people visiting the area, with families moving into the suburb, particularly those wanting to raise children in a bushland setting but near the city. There has been little change in Cowan village since it was first laid out as a crown subdivision in 1910. Lots ranged from 1,500 to 4,500 square metres. The predominance of freestanding three-bedroom houses set in gardens provides a sense of openness, and creates a pleasant transition to the bushland which surrounds the town. Population In the 2016 Census, there were 649 people in Cowan. 86.2% of people were born in Australia and 91.0% of people spoke only English at home.

During this period a bishop from Venice wrote the first surviving remark about Hungarian folk song when he commented on the peculiar singing style of a maid. Church schools in Hungary taught Western Christian chanting, especially in places like Esztergom, Nyitra, Nagyv√°rad, Pannonhalma, Veszpr√©m, V√°c and Csan√°d; and later schools began focusing on singing, spreading Latin hymns across the country. Information about music education during this period is known thanks to manuscripts such as the Notebook of L√°szl√≥ Szalkai, Jacobus de Li√®ge's Speculum musicae (c. 1330-1340, which mentions the use of solmization), the Hah√≥t Codex, the Codex Albensis and the Sacramentarium of Zagreb. The Pray Codex is a collection of \\"liturgical melodies ... in neumatic notation ... containing among other things the earliest written record extant of the Hungarian language, the Funeral Oration, ... independent forms of notation and even independent melodies (Hymn to Mary)\\". The first known example of exchange between Hungarian and Western European music is from the 13th century, the \\"first encounter with the more secular melodic world of the Western world\\". The earliest documented instrumentation in Hungarian music dates back to the whistle in 1222, followed by the koboz in 1326, the bugle in 1355, the fiddle in 1358, the bagpipe in 1402, the lute in 1427 and the trumpet in 1428. Thereafter the organ came to play a major role. Though virtually nothing is known about them, Hungarian minstrels existed throughout the Middle Ages and may have kept ancient pagan religious practices alive. At the Synod of Buda in 1279 the church banned their congregation from listening to them, despite their having come to be employed by noblemen in courts. By the 14th century instrumental music had become their most important repertoire and minstrel singers had become known as igric. The golden age of courtly music (which had followed French models for most of the early Middle Ages before musicians from Flanders, Italy and Germany arrived) was during the reign of Matthias Corvinus and Beatrice. 16th century The N√°dor Codex of 1508 presents the first use of Gregorian melodies with Hungarian texts. The same period saw the local folk styles grow more diverse, while political authorities railed against secular music. Szavolcsi notes the author of the S√°ndor Codex (early 16th century), who described secular music as accompanied by \\"fiddle, lute, drums and cimbalom... and used tenor, discant and contratenor\\" singers, meaning it was in the style of the motet. Song by Andr√°s Farkas from the 1533 Hofgreff Songbook The 16th century saw the rise of Transylvania, a region the Turks never occupied, as a center for Hungarian music, as well as the first Hungarian publications of music, both published in Krak√≥w. Istv√°n G√°lsz√©csi's songbook was the \\"first Hungarian gradual to the Gregorian hymn-melodies and German choral music of which we can see new Hungarian translations\\", while the Cronica of Andr√°s Farkas includes the first surviving historical song. About forty melodies are known from this era, and are already in a distinctively Hungarian style which took influences from across much of Europe in several dozen distinct forms that were \\"mostly notated in a rigid and clumsy way\\" but were \\"undoubtedly much more colourful and flexible in living performance\\" and were in reality \\"little masterpieces of melodic structure\\". The most significant musician of this period was Sebesty√©n Tin√≥di Lantos, the \\"greatest stylist and master of expression of ancient Hungarian epic poetry... whose heritage the people's music of two centuries was unconsciously nourished\\". Accentuated declamation was fashionable in music education during the early 16th century; a more rigid choir style is represented by a collection called the Melopoeiae, from 1507. A collection by Johannes Honterus was the first Hungarian printed work with music, dating from 1548. These collections were enriched by \\"melodic configurations\\" that, according to Bence Szabolcsi, could be explained by the arrival of the \\"song material of the Czech Reformation, the melodic treasure of the German Reformation and the psalter of French Huguenots\\". The poet B√°lint Balassi remains well regarded for his poems from this period, which were based on Polish, Turkish, Italian and German melodies, and may have also been influenced by the villanella. Some songs from this period, influenced by the music of the nobles and their minstrels from as far away as Italy, remained a part of the Hungarian folk tradition at least until modern song collection began. Religious and secular music were closely connected at this time, and documentation of the former grew with the publication of many songbooks filled with free psalm paraphrases called lauds, facilitating the practice of communal singing among the nascent Protestant churches. This conflation of religious and secular song was much criticized from the pulpit, from both the Protestant and Catholic churches. The latter allowed popular songs after a 1564 edict from Ferdinand I, which allowed the bishops to use them only after close scrutiny. They were again banned in 1611, however, and a Catholic collection of Hungarian church songs was not agreed upon until 1629, at the Synod of Nagyszombat. The collection, Benedek Sz≈ël≈ësy's Cantus Catholici, was published in 1651, and wasn't followed by a Protestant version for about 90 years. Hungarian instrumental music was well known in Europe in the 16th century. The lutenist and composer B√°lint Bakfark was especially famous, known as a virtuoso player of the lute; his works were collected and published as Intavolatura and Harmoniae musicae (published in 1553 and 1565 respectively). He was one of the pioneers of a style based on vocal polyphony. The lutenist brothers Melchior and Konrad Neusiedler were also noted, as was Stephan Monetarius, the author of an important early work in music theory, the Epithoma utriusque musices. 17th century During the 17th century, Hungary was divided into three parts, one the region of Transylvania, one controlled by the Turks, and another by the Habsburg. Historic songs declined in popularity, replaced by lyrical poetry. Minstrels were replaced by courtly musicians, who played the trumpet and whistle, or cimbalom, violin or bagpipes; many courts and households had large groups of instrumentals. Some of these musicians were German, Polish, French or Italian, and even included a Spanish guitarist at the court of G√°bor Bethlen, Prince of Transylvania. Little is known about the actual music of this time, however. Instrumental music from the 17th century is known from the collections of various Upper Hungarian and Transylvanian collectors, such as J√°nos K√°joni, who collected the Cantionale Catholicum, K√°joni Codex, Organo Missale and Sacri Concentus. The collectors of the Viet√≥risz Codex, whose identities are unknown, and another anonymous collector from L≈ëcse, also published \\"the first examples of autonomous, developed virginal music, equally accomplished in style, melodic texture and technique of adaptation\\". These songs were characterized by \\"flexible, finely shaded melodies, a tendency to create wider and looser forms, and a gradual independence of the forma (sic) principles of song melodies toward a clearly instrumental conception\\". At the same time, rhythm became more complicated and notation more general. The L≈ëcse manuscript also notably presents an arrangement of dances, the first example of the Hungarian cyclic form; this music and dance had similarities both to the Polish music of the time as well as the subsequent development of the verbunkos style. 17th century Hungarian church music was revolutionized after the 1651 publication of the Cantus Catholici, in which genuine Hungarian motives played a major part. By 1674, the Hungarian Mass was also part of the Cantus Catholici, followed by the adoption of Calvinist psalm tunes in 1693 and Hungarian choral music in 1695. J√°nos K√°joni Organo Missale of 1667 was the first experiment in the creation of a new kind of Hungarian church music, a style that strung together short motives that were shortened, extended or syncopated in a complex rhythmic structure. Italian religious music played an important role in this development, which was documented in an \\"unparalleled example of ancient Hungarian music\\", the Harmonia Caelestis of Prince P√°l Eszterh√°zy, who tried to create a distinctively Hungarian style of church music using influences from opera, oratio literature, the German music of Johann Kaspar von Kerll and Johann Schmeltzer, and the oratorio and cantata styles. Eszterh√°zy's efforts did not last, as the following century saw an influx of muic from Western Europe under the Habsburgs. Around the start of the 18th century, however, the last national uprising of the period occurred, leading the spread of \\"Kuruc songs\\". These songs were authentically Hungarian and hold a \\"central position between the style of the ancient and the new folk music\\". Their influences include elements of Polish, Romanian, Slovak and Ukrainian music in addition to Hungarian melodies. 18th century During the 18th century, students at Hungary's Calvinist colleges, some of whom, being minor nobles, lived in small rural villages, brought with them to their schools their regional styles of music. Colleges like S√°rospatak and Sz√©kelyudvarhely developed choirs that adopted new elements like polyphony. Gy√∂rgy Mar√≥thi of Debrecen published several influential works, and his French psalm book became very popular. By around 1790, the four voice choirs were expanded to eight using accessory voices like accantus, subcantus and concantus, and the discant voice was systematically transpoed into a lower pitch, producing a new form of choral design with similarities to medieval organum and fauxbourdon. The same period saw the popularity of homophoning songs which are recorded in the students' song books; notation, however, was crude, and no extensive collection appeared until 1853, with the publication of √Åd√°m P√°l√≥czi Horv√°th's √ñt√∂df√©lsz√°z √ânekek. These songs show that the mid to late 18th century was a period when the old Hungarian styles died out, and a new style appeared. Many Hungarian musicians and composers of the 18th century preached closer cultural ties with Europe, not believing that Hungarian music could reach the levels of development in Italy and Germany. The aristocracy were interested in the court music of Louis XIV, like the minuet and rondo. Many of these people tried to popularize Viennese-style songs with Hungarian texts, or to use German and Italian forms; these people included the poet L√°szl√≥ Amad√©, novelist Ign√°c M√©sz√°ros and the author and linguist Ferenc Verseghy. Hungarian music did, however, have an effect on composers from elsewhere in Europe. Joseph Haydn's Rondo all' Ongarese (from the Trio in G major (No. 1)), is an example, as is the finale of Beethoven's Symphony No. 3 (Eroica), which uses a Magyar march, and Symphony No. 7, which is a 2/4 tempo with a syncopated rhythm. Beethoven also used Hungarian idioms in the prologue of King Stephen and the epiloque for Ruins of Athens. The 18th century also saw the rise of verbunkos, a form of music that was used by army recruiters. Like much of Hungarian music at the time, it was focused on the melody, with a subordinate text; in spite of this, the vocals became a major part of verbunkos. 19th century By the middle of the 19th century, verbunkos was a major symbol of Hungarian culture, and numerous people published groundbreaking studies and collections of the field. The Musicians' Society National School of Music in Pest, headed after 1840 by G√°bor M√°tray, one of the \\"leading personalities of Hungarian musical life\\", did much to encourage this study. Andr√°s Bartay's 1835 study of Hungarian harmonics, Magyar Apollo and his 1833-34 Eredeti N√©pdalok, were pioneering works in the field. In 1838, a young Franz Liszt was inspired to travel home to Hungary, studying the music of the country; he would go on to incorporate what he learned in many of his world-famous compositions. Other composers from this period included B√©ni Egressy, who used 18th century folk songs in his compositions, K√°lm√°n Simonffy, who was the \\"most original and most inventive\\" songwriter of the era, whose works \\"most nearly approached the ideal of 'popular melodic culture', as well as lesser-known figures like Guszt√°v Sz√©nfy, Guszt√°v Nyizsnyai and Ign√°c Bogn√°r. In spite of their desires to glorify Hungarian folk culture, the music these composers used remained primarily the music of the middle and upper classes. It was not until the very end of the 19th century and into the 20th that the authentic music of ethnic Hungarians became a major part of compositions. Other Hungarian composers did not attempt to use verbunkos or other Hungarian styles in their music. German music was a much stronger influence on the music of the Catholic Church and in the songbooks of Mih√°ly Boz√≥ky. The playwright Elem√©r Szentirmay (also known as J√°nos N√©meth) was very popular in his time, known for his \\"form of expression and scale of popular character\\" whose \\"works surpassed in popularity everything written by his contemporaries\\". The Hungarian operetta first appeared in the 1860s, popularized by Ign√°c Bogn√°r, Geza Allaga and Jeno Huber, followed by Elek Erkel and Gy√∂rgy B√°nffy; in the early 20th century, the Viennese style predominated in the work of Huszka, Pongr√°c Kacs√≥hKacs√≥h, Buttykay, Jacobi, K√°lm√°n and Leh√°r. Aside from the popular operetta, the field of Hungarian opera reached fruition in the 19th century. Ferenc Erkel was of great importance in his field, creating the first opera in the Hungarian language using music from popular songs, the verbunkos tradition as well as the singing forms of Italian and French opera. There were other opera composers as well, though the most important was Mih√°ly Mosonyi, who did much to use Hungarian themes in his work. The late 19th century saw a decline in the nationalistic tendencies of Hungarian music, which deteriorated \\"into the works of salon composers, into the poorly written genre of stylish 'Hungarian fantasies', 'Gipsy arrangements'\\" and other styles more influenced by foreign countries than Hungarian traditions. The result was increased antagonism between those enamoured of foreign music and the cultivators of Hungarian (and Roma-Hungarian) music, a dichotomy that \\"could only result in deceiving the country with the opium of semi-education on the one hand and superficial nationalism on the other\\". Hans Koessler, a teacher with the Academy of Music, did more than anyone to accentuate the German classical elements in Hungarian music, though some of his students, like Ernst von Dohn√°nyi, placed prominent Hungarian themes in their own works.

Map of Georges Island. Georges Island from the water. View from the water of the dock, visitor center, and fort entrance. Georges Island is one of the islands in the Boston Harbor, situated just over from downtown Boston. The island has a permanent size of , plus an intertidal zone of a further , and rises to a height of above sea level. Historic Fort Warren is on the island. Because of this, and since a ferry operates from Boston to the island, it is a popular destination and one of the easiest islands to access in the Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area. History At the time of Euro-American colonization, Georges Island was composed of two drumlins, rising out of the bay like other nearby islands. The island was used for agriculture for 200 years until 1825 when the U.S. government acquired it for coastal defense. Over the next 20 years the island was dramatically altered, and one of the country's finest forts was built. Dedicated in 1847, Fort Warren's defensive design was virtually obsolete upon completion. However, the fort served as a training ground, patrol point, and Civil War prison that gained a favorable reputation for the humane treatment of its Confederate prisoners. After 100 years of military use, the fort was decommissioned in 1947 and acquired by the Metropolitan District Commission for historic preservation and recreation in 1958. To this day, in the fort's dark corridors, the legend lives on of \\"The Lady in Black,\\" the ghost of a Confederate prisoner's wife who is said to have been sentenced to death for aiding in an escape after disguising herself as a male soldier, and hanged in a black robe which was the best the soldiers could do to accommodate her last request of being executed in female clothing. The myth was a creation of author Edward Rowe Snow to bring attention to Fort Warren need for preservation and protection. His efforts through the Friends of Fort Warren were instrumental to Georges Island's inclusion in Massachusetts State Parks and eventually National Park System. Present day The island has fields for recreational use, a small food vendor, and twenty one mooring balls available to the public by reservation. It is served throughout the summer and early fall by ferries to and from Boston and by a shuttle boat to and from the surrounding islands during the summer season. Today the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation owns and staffs the island. Rangers patrol and give interpretive tours. The island is open to the public May through October. Georges Island is a transportation hub, as inter-island ferries run from Georges to other islands in the park. State laws prohibit alcohol, fireworks, and firearms on the island. Also, the island has a strict carry on‚Äìcarry off policy for trash. Confederate memorial, removed The Commonwealth's only Confederate memorial was installed on the island in 1963 by the Boston Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. The cenotaph commemorating 13 southern Civil War soldiers, who died while imprisoned at Fort Warren, remained on display until Governor Charlie Baker called for its removal in June 2017. The memorial was subsequently covered over, then removed in October 2017, when it was placed in storage at the Massachusetts Archives.

Biography Venus of Poetry by Julio Romero de Torres, painted in 1913. He was born in C√≥rdoba, Spain, where he lived most of his life. His father was the famous painter Rafael Romero Barros and his mother was Rosario de Torres Delgado. Julio learned about art from his father who was the director, curator and founder of C√≥rdoba's Museo Provincial de Bellas Artes and an impressionist painter. He took an interest in art at a young age and started studying at the School of Fine Arts when he was 10. He went to Madrid to work and study in 1906. He also travelled all over Europe to study and he picked up a symbolist style, for which he is best known. A museum dedicated to the work of de Torres is situated at Plaza del Potro 1 Cordoba 14002. Style Naranjas y limones (1927), by Julio Romero de Torres He spent most of his life living in C√≥rdoba and Madrid and both places had influences on his paintings. He combined many different styles when he painted because he had many different influences including realism, which was a popular style at that time and impressionism, which he picked up from living in C√≥rdoba and from his father. While in C√≥rdoba he became part of the late 19th century intellectual movement that was based on the Royal Academy of Science, Arts and Literature. Julio Romero also won many awards in his lifetime. In 1895 he won an honorable mention at the National Exhibition and later won third place in 1899 and 1904. In 1914 he relocated to Madrid, where he made contact with the intellectual and artistic environment of the time together with his brother Enrique. He became a regular at the caf√© Nuevo Levante and his paintings began to reflect the philosophical currents of the times, represented by such writers of the times as Ram√≥n del Valle-Incl√°n and Rub√©n Dar√≠o. When the war broke out in 1914 Julio Romero fought for the allies as a pilot. After the war in 1916 he became a professor of Clothing Design in the School of Fine Arts in Madrid. In 1922 he traveled to The Argentine Republic with his brother Enrique. He later got sick and returned to C√≥rdoba to recover. His condition continued to deteriorate until he entered a state of delirium. He died on 10 May 1930 at the age of 55. Legacy The Museum of Julio Romero de Torres at his former residence in C√≥rdoba houses examples of his works, as well as works by Francisco Zurbar√°n, Alejo Fern√°ndez, Antonio del Castillo and Vald√©s Leal. Some of his important works at the museum include Amor m√≠stico y amor profano, El Poema de C√≥rdoba, Marta y Mar√≠a, La saeta, Cante hondo, La consagraci√≥n de la copla, Carmen, and La chiquita piconera.

History  WHOD advertisement for Movin' Around with Mary Dee, which featured Mary Dee and her brother Mal Goode, on the air from 1948-1956 The station signed on in 1948 as WHOD, licensed then to Homestead, before changing its call letters to WAMO in 1956 (the AMO referred to the Allegheny, Monongahela and Ohio rivers). WAMO served the area's African-American community for the following 50 years, although the Urban contemporary format it started with eventually went to WAMO-FM, its FM sister station. It was also a daytimer until the 1990s when its signal was upgraded, and its city of license was changed from Pittsburgh to Millvale. For a time during the 1990s, the station bounced back between the call letters WYJZ and WAMO. What put WAMO on the map, though, was in the 1950s, when WAMO disc jockey Craig \\"Porky\\" Chedwick, started playing a variety of what then came to be known as \\"the first oldies\\", scouring record bins for lost R&B; recordings, building up a library for such material and creating through his show what came to be later known as \\"Pittsburgh's Oldies\\", a show and style later imitated by many DJs in Pittsburgh, as well as across the country. Many credit Chedwick with being the father of \\"Oldies\\" radio. On January 31, 2006 WAMO inked a deal with Radio One to pick up its Urban Talk format. The change took place on February 27, 2006.

After education at a large private school in Brighton, he was admitted as a pensioner at Caius College, Cambridge, on 19 April 1843, and graduated B.A. in 1847. He was destined by his family for the pulpit, but was diverted from taking orders by doubts as to faith and vocation, and by the feeling that the church was rather \\"a tomb for the preservation of embalmed doctrines\\" than a living organism. In his perplexity, he got leave of absence from his home for a year, and left England. He went in 1849 to California, became one of the band of 'forty- niners,' and remained abroad, on the shores of the Pacific, mainly in America and Australia, where he became a commissioner of crown lands, until the one year of absence had grown into nine. He married in Australia, but was left a widower with one son, after a year of wedlock. Returning to England at the end of 1857, he devoted himself to literature, with the dominant aim of Many of the vicissitudes of his life, both physical and mental, were recorded with but little distortion in his romance called The Pilgrim and the Shrine. From the Life and Correspondence of Herbert Ainslie, B.A. Cantab., which was published in 1867, and warmly acclaimed by thoughtful critics. It was followed by a romance called The Higher Law (1869), which represents the escape of a youth from the trammels, no longer of orthodox religion, but of traditional morals. Maitland became a figure in society, and was appreciated highly by Lord Houghton and Sir Francis Hastings Doyle. He began to write in the Spectator and Examiner, and did some reviewing for the 'Athen√¶um' from 1870 onwards. His book By and By: an Historical Romance of the Future (1873) led to his making the acquaintance of Anna Kingsford, whom he visited at her husband's vicarage of Atcham, in Shropshire, in February 1874. In conjunction with her he produced anonymously, in 1875, The Keys of the Creeds. At the close of 1874 his mother died at Brighton, and Maitland accompanied Mrs. Kingsford to Paris. He joined her crusade against materialism, animal food, and vivisection, upon which subject he wrote a forcible letter in the Examiner in June 1876, which attracted the most widespread attention to the subject. In this same year, he first saw the apparition of his father, who had then been ten years dead, and he soon afterwards recognised that he 'belonged to the order of the mystics.' In 1876, Maitland informs us that he acquired a new sense, that of 'a spiritual sensitiveness,' by means of which he opened relations with the church invisible of the spiritual world. He was able to see the spiritual condition of people. In a state of mind which must have approximated to that of William Blake, he tells us that he saw upon one occasion the soul of a tree. He could also, he asseverated, recall the memory of some of his past lives. He was told through a sensitive that these had been many, that he had lived in trees and animals, and that he had been a prince. He 'remembered' a life lived in ancient Thebes; he believed that he had been Marcus Aurelius and St. John the Evangelist. St. John, he believed, was a reincarnation of the prophet Daniel. In 1881, before a highly fashionable audience, he gave a series of lectures upon his new or, as he affirmed, revived esoteric creed; these lectures formed the groundwork of his 'revelation,' in which Anna Kingsford collaborated, The Perfect Way; or, the Finding of Christ, 1882 (revised 1887 and 1890). By publishing this in his own name he admits that he cut himself off from his old friendships and all his literary and social ambitions. A striking parallel is afforded by the later life of Laurence Oliphant, with whom Maitland had a good deal in common, though he was constrained to express dissent from the spiritualistic theories embodied in 'Sympneumata.' Maitland joined the Theosophical Society about 1883, but the vagaries of Madame Blavatsky soon compelled him to secede from the 'London Lodge,' and in May 1884, in collaboration with Mrs. Kingsford, he founded the Hermetic Society, of mystic rather than occult character, claiming no abnormal powers, and 'depending for guidance upon no Mahatmas.' In 1885, with some help from 'Anna,' he rendered into English the Minerva Mundi and other hermetic writings of Hermes Trismegistus. In 1886, he and Mrs. Kingsford visited Madame Blavatsky at Ostend, but refused to be inveigled back into the theosophical fold. Maitland was a spiritualist. He joined the London Spiritualist Alliance in March, 1884.M. A. Oxon (William Stainton Moses). The London Spiritualist Alliance. Light. Volume 4. March 15, 1884. p. 108 He was a vegetarian. After the death of Anna Kingsford, in February 1888, Maitland lived alone at 1 Thurloe Square Studios, London, where he professed to receive continual 'illumination' from his former collaborator. In 1891, he helped found the Humanitarian League, with Henry S. Salt. Henceforth he devoted his main energies to an elaborate record of their singular partnership and co- operation, though he still found time to do a certain amount of journalistic work, and in November 1891, in response to astral intimations, he founded the Esoteric Christian Union. He corresponded with Gandhi, who in 1894, became South Africa's Esoteric Christian Union agent. Maitland was also the one who introduced Gandhi to Tolstoy's The Kingdom of God Is Within You, a book which \\"overwhelmed\\" Gandhi and led him toward nonviolence as a means to change. Gandhi and Maitland corresponded until the latter's death. His later works were Clothed with the Sun, being the Book of the Illuminations of Anna (Bonus) Kingsford, 1889; The New Gospel of Interpretation, 1892; and Anna Kingsford. Her Life, Letters, Diary, and Work. By her Collaborator . . . with a Supplement of Post-mortem Communications, 2 vols. 1896. After the conclusion of this last, which he regarded as his magnum opus, Maitland's physical and mental decline was remarkably rapid. In 1896, he went to reside with Colonel Currie at The Warders, Tonbridge, and he lost the power of speech some months before his death, on 2 October 1897. He was buried in Tonbridge cemetery on 5 October, by his wife Esther, who died in Australia, he left a son, a surgeon- major in the Bombay medical service.

Biography Sills was born in Chicago, Illinois into a wealthy family. He was the son of William Henry Sills, a successful mineral dealer, and Josephine Antoinette Troost Sills, an heiress from a prosperous banking family. Upon completing high school, Sills was offered a one-year scholarship to the University of Chicago, where he studied psychology and philosophy. After graduating, he was offered a position at the university as a researcher and within several years worked his way up to become a professor at the school. In 1905, stage actor Donald Robertson visited the school to lecture on author and playwright Henrik Ibsen and suggested to Sills that he try his hand at acting. On a whim, Sills agreed and left his teaching career to embark on a stint in acting. Sills joined Robertson's stock theater company and began touring the country. In 1908, while Sills was performing in New York City, he attracted the notice of Broadway producers such as David Belasco and Charles Frohman. That same year he made his Broadway debut in This Woman and This Man. From 1908 to 1914, Sills appeared in about a dozen Broadway shows. In 1910, Sills married English stage actress Gladys Edith Wynne, a niece of actress Edith Wynne Matthison. The union produced one child, Dorothy Sills; Gladys filed for divorce in 1925. In 1926, Sills married silent film actress Doris Kenyon with whom he had a son, Kenyon Clarence Sills, born in 1927. Motion pictures The Silver Sheet, studio publication promoting Skin Deep (1922) In 1914, Sills made his film debut in the big-budget drama The Pit for the World Film Company and was signed to a contract with film producer William A. Brady. Sills made three more films for the company, including The Deep Purple opposite Clara Kimball Young. By the early 1920s, Sills had achieved matinee idol status and was working for various film studios, including Metro Pictures, Famous Players- Lasky, and Path√© Exchange. In 1923 he was Colleen Moore's leading man in the very successful Flaming Youth, but his biggest box office success was The Sea Hawk (1924), the top-grossing film of that year. in 1925, Sills and her wife, Doris Kenyon, starred The Unguarded Hour for First National Pictures. In 1926 he wrote the screenplay for Men of Steel, also starring in it along with Kenyon. Sills had begun to make the transition to sound pictures as early as 1928 with the part-talking The Barker. His final appearance was in the title role of The Sea Wolf (1930), a performance called \\"incisive\\" by the New York Times. Death and legacy Sills died unexpectedly of a heart attack in 1930 while playing tennis with his wife at his Brentwood home in Los Angeles, California at the age of 48. He was interred at the Rosehill Cemetery and Mausoleum in Chicago, Illinois. In December 1930, Photoplay published a poem found among his personal effects. He was a founding member in 1913 of Actors' Equity. On May 11, 1927, he was among the original 36 individuals in the film industry to found the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), a professional honorary organization dedicated to the advancement of the arts and sciences of motion pictures. Sills also wrote a book, published posthumously in 1932: Values: A Philosophy of Human Needs ‚Äì Six Dialogues on Subjects from Reality to Immortality, co-edited by Ernest Holmes. For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Milton Sills received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6263 Hollywood Boulevard. Sills was the favorite actor of poet Weldon Kees as a child, and Sills' Men of Steel influenced Kees' poem \\"1926\\".

It was the first permanent residence in the garden. Nails were used in its construction. The interior decoration combines European neo-classical style with traditional Thai motifs and architecture and early-20th century modernisation. Vimanmek Mansion is Victorian-style, with Western influences combined with Thai architecture. Golden teak was the primary building material. The mansion is L-shaped, 60 meters by 20 meters. It has three levels and the residence is octagonal and has four levels. The lowest level is made of brick and cement and the upper levels are constructed of golden teak. The color of the roof is cream and red in Thai architectural style and the pattern of the window and ventilators is called kanom pang khing.

It is part of the parish of Dromcollogher-Broadford (previously known as Killagholehane). It is also very close to the boundary of north County Cork. There are many variations of 'Drom'. The locals spell it Dromcollogher, but Drumcolloher, Dromcolloher, Drumcullogher, and numerous other variations can be found. Dromcolliher is the version adopted by the Ordnance Survey, and postal authorities. Since 1962, the town has been home to the Irish Dresden pottery factory, which closed its doors in April 2009 but re-opened in June 2015. History It was first mentioned in the 1160, in \\"The Book of Leinster\\". Other historical records include references in \\"Westropp\\" (1201), Munster Journal (1751), and the population was recorded as 658 in 1831. It is classed a medieval town by Limerick County Council (Local Governing Body), and has a list of protected structures under the 'County Development Plan'. These include the facades of Aherne's and O'Kelly's, the local creamery, and courthouse, as well as two churches, Killagholehane and St. Timothys (now known as St. Bartholomews). The modern church was built in 1824, by Fr. Micheal Fitzgerald, who purchased the land from a local landowner. It was restored several times, but was given a dramatic overhaul in the late 1980s/early 1990s by Healy and Partners Architects, Limerick. Dromcollogher was one of the starting points for the Irish Co-Op Movement, with the first Co-Operative creamery being set up here in 1889 on the initiative of Horace Plunkett. The listed building has since been restored, and is now the National Dairy Cooperative Museum. Percy French, the renowned Irish Composer, once stayed here and composed the song \\"There's Only One Street In Dromcollogher\\". This is in fact untrue as there are many streets in Dromcolligher and if you ask anyone from the area they will be proud to tell you so. = Dromcollogher fire = Aftermath of the fire On 5 September 1926, a timber barn being used as a temporary cinema in Dromcollogher caught fire when a candle ignited a reel of nitrate film. Forty-eight people died in this tragedy, always known locally as the Dromcollogher Burning; forty-six of them are buried in a large grave in the grounds of the local church. It remained the worst known fire disaster in Irish history until the Betelgeuse incident in 1979 and the Stardust disaster in 1981, which claimed fifty and forty-eight lives respectively.  Sport  Dromcollogher-Broadford won the 2015 Limerick Junior Hurling Championship, beating Na Pairsaigh in the final. This was the club's second such championship win since Dromcollogher/Broadford joined forces, with the first being in 1993. In 2008, Dromcollogher/Broadford GAA club won their first and only Munster Senior Club Football Championship competition, defeating Kilmurry-Ibrackane from Clare at the Gaelic Grounds. The only other team from Limerick to win the championship had been Thomond College in 1977. Dromcollogher-Broadford Ladies football club was founded in 1999, and won 2 All Ireland National Division 2 Titles in the Peil na n√ìg under 14 competition - in 2003 (Carlow) and in 2004 (Galway). The club have also competed in Munster Junior club semi-finals on 3 occasions, and in 2016, competed in their first Munster club Junior Final, losing to Kinsale by 4 points.  Festivals  The Dromcollogher Carnival is held each year in early July. This street festival, which includes a number of activities and attractions for different age-groups, has been running for over 74 years. Activities range from a 4 km run, to a Harley Davidson parade, to live street bands.

Statue of Konrad Duden. Konrad Alexander Friedrich Duden (3 January 1829 ‚Äì 1 August 1911) was a Gymnasium (high school) teacher who became a philologist. He founded the well-known German language dictionary bearing his name Duden, somewhat like Noah Webster in the United States.  Life  Duden was born in Lackhausen, Rhineland. After receiving his Abitur in 1846 in Wesel, Duden studied history, Germanistics, and classical philology at Bonn. There he joined the Wingolfsbund student organization and took part in the political activities of the student societies during the revolutionary year 1848. He broke off his training phase in Soest and took a position as a home tutor in Genoa, Italy. There he met the daughter of the German Consul, Adeline Jakob, whom he married in 1861 and with whom he had six children. In 1859 he returned to Germany and worked as a teacher and rose to the position of Director of the Archigymnasium in Soest. In 1869 he was appointed \\"Gymnasium\\" (High-School) director in Schleiz and in 1876 became director of the Royal Gymnasium in Hersfeld. It was here he published his most important work, the \\"Complete Orthographic Dictionary of the German Language\\" (Vollst√§ndiges Orthographisches W√∂rterbuch der deutschen Sprache). In 1905, he retired to Wiesbaden/Sonnenberg. He died in 1911 in Sonnenberg and was buried in the family grave in Bad Hersfeld.  Significance  During his entire life he strove toward the unification and simplification of the German orthography. His 1880 dictionary represents the start of the Duden series and included 28,000 words on 187 pages. In 1902, the German parliamentary upper house (\\"Bundesrat\\") made his rules for orthography mandatory in official state documents. Austria-Hungary and Switzerland followed. One hundred years after his death, the Duden dictionary remains the authoritative source for German orthography.  Works  * Anleitung zur Rechtschreibung, 18??

In April 2019, the campus was sold to The Independent Institute of Education (The IIE), a leader in the higher education sphere, and is no longer called or affiliated with Monash University. The IIE is internationally recognised by the British Accreditation Council. IIE MSA, formerly Monash South Africa, was founded in 2001 by Monash University. Monash South Africa (MSA) was a branch campus of the Australian Monash University. It was founded in 2001 and was located on a 100 hectare site in Ruimsig, north-west of Johannesburg, in the province of Gauteng. At its height, Monash South Africa had over 4000 students with a mix from 50 African countries. As Monash South Africa was sold to The Independent Institute of Education a subsidiary of ADvTECH Group. It is now called the IIE MSA and is still offering degrees and diplomas, and is even adding more qualifications to their range.  History  Beginning in the 1990s, Monash University in Melbourne, Australia began an extensive internationalisation program. Vice-Chancellor at the time, David Robinson, aspired for Monash to have campuses on every continent.[2] The University's Malaysia Campus was the first of these, with plans for an African offering developing in the late 1990s. In 2001, it became the first international university to gain registration to operate in South Africa.[3] The plan was initially opposed by some of the staff at Monash's Australian campuses, who were concerned that millions of dollars was being poured into overseas ventures, while staff were being made redundant in Australia.[2] The campus expanded rapidly since its establishment in 2001. In its first intake, Monash South Africa (MSA) took on just over 100 students. By 2008, there were over 2,200 students, and the operations are expanded to keep up with a demand for places which is increasing by 35% per year. A new library and learning commons were opened in 2007. By 2012 a fully modernised sports precinct was built, which played host to the eventual Gauteng state champion Monash South Africa female basketball team, coached by Tomas Sanchez and Matthew Falvey. Financial issues were unresolved and in August 2013, Monash South Africa was effectively 'sold' to Laureate International Universities who purchased its freehold land and buildings and took over running the university. Monash in Australia has come under pressure from the Auditor-general in the state of Victoria (in which Monash is located) to reduce its spending on overseas operations.[4]. A AU$150 million grant from the International Finance Corporation was part of the deal, awarded to strengthen higher education in Africa[5]. Monash in Australia continues to assure academic standards, but Laureate Education has now become the majority partner. The institution has developed some research capacity, with research nodes in water, injury prevention and global movements. Its research output (various projects and scholarly publications) is increasing, with the ambition of becoming one of the most research- intensive sites in Africa.[6] In April 2019, ADvTECH acquired Monash South Africa from Monash and Laureate. Monash South Africa is now known as IIE MSA, and a leading brand of The Independent Institute of Education (The IIE), the higher education subsidiary of ADvTECH. The IIE is South Africa's largest and the most accredited private higher education institution which operates across 21 sites and is internationally recognised by the British Accreditation Council.  Faculties and Courses Schools= Monash South Africa no longer accepts students into degrees and diplomas the IIE MSA which bought Monash SA continued the offering which falls in the following :  Faculty of Business, Engineering and Technology  The faculty offers a range of exciting undergraduate programmes, Honours programmes, postgraduate diplomas and master's degrees. It also recognises the busy working professional, whether they are at early, mid- or advanced career levels, and accommodates flexible part-time and postgraduate options. The IIE MSA's Faculty of Business, Engineering and Technology offers IIE undergraduate degrees in the following areas:[7] *Accounting *Computer and Information Sciences *Economics *Electrical and Electronic Engineering *Law *Management *Marketing It is one of only two private institutions to receive South African Institute of Chartered Accountants (SAICA) accreditation for its accounting degree. In 2013, Monash South Africa began offering the SAICA accredited Postgraduate Diploma in Accounting program, which serves as the last entrance requirement to write the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants (SAICA) board exams. This was the first time the accreditation had been offered to a private institution. Monash achieved this through a partnership with Independent service provider CA Connect. From 2018 academic year, the institution announced it would go it alone in offering the program going forward.  Faculty of Social and Health Sciences  The IIE MSA's Faculty of Social and Health Sciences currently offers IIE undergraduate degrees in the following areas:[8] *Bachelor of Child and Youth Care, *Bachelor of Public Health *Bachelor of Social Science - with the following areas of study: *Communication and Media Studies, *Criminology and Criminal Justice, *Development Studies (incorporating Human Geography), *International Studies, *Journalism Studies, *Philosophy, *Political Studies, *Psychology, *Public Relations Practice, and *Sociology. 1The Bachelor of Child and Youth Care was endorsed by the South African Council of Social Service Professions. = Programmes = A range of IIE undergraduate and postgraduate degrees and short learning programmes are offered at IIE MSA.

Mrs. Hunt had avoided accusations that she profited from her volunteer work by signing over to the Scientific Temperance Association the royalties from the temperance textbooks she wrote and edited for the WCTU. That association, which consisted of Mary Hunt, her pastor, and a few of her friends, used its income to maintain the national headquarters of the Department of Scientific Instruction. That building was also the very large home of Mrs. Hunt. Upon her death, this arrangement clouded ownership of her estate, which led to the creation of the Scientific Temperance Foundation. Mrs. Hunt's personal secretary, Cora Stoddard, headed the new organization. Because of the substantial fortune she had amassed in promoting compulsory temperance education, and the tens of millions of textbooks this required, the Scientific Temperance Federation was able to engage in a wide variety of activities to promote the temperance movement and prohibition. A major nation- wide project was an innovative \\"Education on Wheels\\" project that took temperance education directly to people at their homes and farms. With the repeal of prohibition and the decline of the temperance movement, the Federation joined the Temperance Education Foundation in 1933. Sources *Scientific Temperance Federation.

The River Feale runs parallel to the village and is fed by the Caher River that divides the village. Mountcollins is in the parish of Mountcollins-Tournafulla. The local post office closed a few years ago. The last grocery shop closed in 2008. The village skyline is dominated by a large Roman Catholic church with an 80 foot steeple which can be plainly seen from both bordering County Cork and County Kerry When entering the village from either end there are very narrow bridges which only one car can cross over at a time.  History  Tournafulla-Mountcollins parish was formed in 1838 from part of the parish of Killeedy. Until 1586, Mountcollins had been part of the parish of Monagea. The present day population of the parish is about 1,500 people. Mountcollins was formerly called Knockroedermot. The area used to be called the \\"Munster Coalfield\\". A large tract of land was reclaimed here in the middle of the nineteenth century. There are hills to the north and south- east and the land is mainly boggy. In the past, there was little more than a road in Mountcollins and people used to say, \\"I'm going to the road\\" in reference to it. During the famine in Mountcollins, a number of new roads were laid as part of the relief works that began nationwide in an effort to alleviate the immense poverty that existed at the time. Mountcollins got its present name from Fr Luke Collins. Fr Collins served as priest to both Abbeyfeale and Mountcollins from the 1730s until his death in 1775. Fr Collins first said mass in a building on a hill called 'the Mount', which is the site of the present day church. Hence the name Mountcollins. The √ì Coile√°in ruled Southwest Limerick from the fourth to the thirteenth century. The area was called the Tuath of Corca O√≠che, after the clan. The Gaelic lords of the Corca O√≠che took the name √ì Macasa that became anglicised as Mackessy. To the east of Corca O√≠che lay the lands of the √ì Coile√°in called Claonghlais. The name √ì Coile√°in was anglicised as Collins.  Employment  Agriculture is the main source of income for most locals with the majority of the remainder commuting to neighbouring Abbeyfeale and Limerick for more commercial and industrial employment.

The station, which is owned by St. Joseph Ministries, broadcasts at 1510 kHz, with a transmitter power of 5,000 watts daytime, 2,500 watts critical hours, and only 1 watt nighttime. The city of license is Monroeville, Pennsylvania. WPGR is a non- commercial Catholic radio station. 1510 AM is United States clear-channel frequency, on which WLAC in Nashville, Tennessee is the dominant Class A station. HistoryBeginnings as WPSL= It all began one day in the 1960s, when a group of friends just back from a fishing trip, approached local businessman Thomas M. ‚ÄúTipper‚Äù Sylves with an idea they had been kicking around for a community radio station for Monroeville. Sylves was a prominent citizen in the community. He had been a coal miner, horse trader, lumberman, railroader, cattle baron and real estate broker, and he was always alert to new business opportunities ‚Äì he listened. The first step was to see if there was an AM frequency available. Jack Lieb, an attorney who work with the FCC, was contacted; he found that 1510 on the AM dial had been frozen for government use, but was about to be released. Leib wanted to pursue the opportunity, but he needed financial backing, and that's where Tipper Sylves came in. Sylves and Lieb soon formed Monroeville Broadcasting Company, Inc. The next step was to find a location. Sylves set aside five acres of some property that he owned just off Strochein road. There they would build a seven-room office building adjacent to the entrance of the US Steel Research labs. The facility, with an initial investment of over $100,000, represented one of the most modern equipped stations in western Pennsylvania. The new owner-operators appointed Bill Lynch as station manager and senior announcer. Sharing the microphone with Lynch would be Ed McLaughin and Bob McKee, both well-known local radio personalities. The nickname of one of Sylves' daughters, Esma, (Punchy) was to find a place in the new stations call letters: W ...P...Punchy...S...Sylves... L...Lieb, -- WPSL. WPSL first went on the air on September 27, 1964. Operating from sunrise to sundown, it had a power of a 250 watts with a signal that radiated out over 47 air miles, effectively covering Allegheny County. In time, Jack Leib got out of the business, selling his shares to Sarah Sylves Thompson, so that she and her father now owned two-thirds of the stock. With the death of Tipper Sylves in the 1970s, and her sister Punchy shortly afterward, Sarah put the company up for sale, closing it with a dark license by the end of 1979. Sarah Sylves Thompson died in 1995 at the age of 86. =The X-15 Experiment= The station returned to the air in 1980 under a new set of call letters, WRUA, and a new owner, Barua Communications of Monroeville, founded by Dr. Subrata Barua, a local podiatrist of Indian origin, taking control of the station in April 1980. The station operated with a format of MOR music and talk under these same call letters until 1989, when Barua leased the station to another operator (Julco Enterprises), Robert Julian. WRUA took on a new set of call letters, and WXVX (the last three standing for the Roman numerals 15 10, \\"XV X\\") was born. The new WXVX, marketed as \\"X-15\\" was created as an outlet for progressive and alternative rock after New Kensington-licensed FM station WXXP switched its format from this kind of music to adult contemporary and adopted the slogan \\"Mix 100.7\\". An alternative explanation for its creation was that the new Program Director had volunteered at WPTS and WYEP - and was looking to merge the spirits of those stations into the form of a commercial outlet for the market. WXVX's presentation was that of inmates running the asylum, with concerts being held outside the station's ramshackle studio building (whose address by this time was unofficially renamed One Progressive Alley), by up and coming new rock acts. Though the station proved popular with listeners, and introduced acts such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam and Lenny Kravitz to the market, it didn't meet its financial goals and the station reverted to Barua's control in 1992. A volunteer airstaff, dedicated to the format, kept the station going by working for free and selling airtime, including its new general manager, Paul Goodman. Goodman managed to keep WXVX afloat until it was sold to another local doctor who owned several properties in the area. The new doctor leased the station to Chae Communications, a broadcast company controlled by former WLOA General Manager Del King, who programmed a format of urban adult contemporary, which was launched in June 1996. Unable to make a go of the operation, King let the contract lapse. WXVX was then sold in 1997 to Westmoreland County broadcaster Michael Horvath, who changed from the WXVX urban format, and put an automated format of 1980s' music on the air, soliciting the airtime for sale to those interested in their own radio programs. After a few years, the station was sold to Mortenson Broadcasting from Kentucky. Mortenson carried an automated gospel music format from Sheridan Broadcasting during his tenure and eventually sold the station to Sheridan several years later. Switch to Catholic programming On May 15, 2009, Sheridan announced that it has sold WAMO, WAMO-FM and WPGR to St. Joseph Ministries for $9 Million. On September 1, 2009 WPGR signed off the air. It returned to the air February 15, 2010 with a live broadcast of a Catholic Mass, simulcast from the newly renamed WAOB-FM. After its conclusion, the station announced that it will begin regular programming on March 19, with only Mass broadcasts being carried in the interim.

The Treaty of Petr√≥polis, signed on November 11, 1903 in the Brazilian Imperial city of Petr√≥polis, near Rio de Janeiro, ended tensions between Bolivia and Brazil over the then-Bolivian territory of Acre (today the Acre state), a desirable territory during the contemporary rubber boom. The treaty, drafted by Brazilian foreign affairs minister Jos√© Paranhos, Baron of Rio Branco, gave Brazil the territory of Acre (191,000 km¬≤), in exchange for over 3,000 km¬≤ of Brazilian territory between the Abun√¢ and Madeira rivers, a monetary payment of two million British pounds, paid in two installments, and a pledge of a rail-link between the Bolivian city of Riberalta and the Brazilian city of Porto Velho, which would bypass the rapids on the Madeira. The rail line was called the Madeira-Mamor√© Railway. It was supposed to go as far as Riberalta, on the Rio Beni, above that river's rapids, but had to stop short at Guajar√°- Mirim. This was actually the third such attempt. In the 1870s, during the rubber boom, the American George Church was defeated twice by the heat, the difficulty of the terrain and appalling loss of life from fever. The contract for the Madeira-Mamor√© railway required by the treaty was won by another American, Percival Farquhar. Construction began in August 1907 and was completed on July 15, 1912.Revista Hist√≥ria Viva, n¬∫ 14, pg 30-41. \\"Dossi√™ Madeira-Mamor√©\\". Editora Duetto. S√£o Paulo. (2004). The project cost US$33 million. At least 3,600 men died building the 367 km of track Guajaramirin- Station (popular estimates say that each one hundred sleepers cost one human life). The Madeira-Mamor√© railway had about a year of full operation before the combination of the collapse of rubber prices, the opening of a railway from Bolivia to the Pacific via Chile and of the Panama Canal rendered it uneconomical. It was kept in operation until 1972. The BR-364 road eventually subsumed the route as railway bridges were taken over, leaving what remained of the track to enthusiasts to salvage what they could.

The term jilbƒÅb or jilbaab () refers to any long and loose-fit coat or outer garment worn by some Muslim women. Wearers believe that this definition of jilbab fulfills the Quranic choice for a hijab. Jilbab, jubbah or jilaabah is also known as chador by Persian speakers in Iran and Afghanistan. The modern jilbƒÅb covers the entire body. Some women will also cover the hands with gloves and the face along with a niqƒÅb. In recent years, a short visor is often included to protect the face from the tropical sun. Qur'an and hadith The plural of jilbƒÅb, jalabib, is found in the Qur'an, verse 33:59 (Surah Al-Ahzab). A popular translation by Yusuf Ali goes of the transliterated Arabic goes, > Ya ayyuha an-Nabiyy qul li azwajika wa banatika wa nisa al-mu'minin yudnina > alayhinna min jalabib hinna; dhalika adna an yu'rafna fa laa yu'dhayn. Wa > kana Allahu Ghafur Rahim > O Prophet! Tell thy wives and daughters, and the believing women, that they > should cast their [jalabib] (Jilbabs) over their persons (when abroad): that > is most convenient, that they should be known (as such) and not molested. > And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. This is the following from the Quran which explains how a Muslim woman must act and dress: > \\"Tell the believing men that they shall subdue their eyes (and not stare at > the women), and to maintain their chastity. This is purer for them. God is > fully Cognizant of everything they do. And tell the believing women to > subdue their eyes, and maintain their chastity. They shall not reveal any > parts of their bodies, except that which is necessary. They shall cover > their chests, and shall not relax this code in the presence of other than > their husbands, their fathers, the fathers of their husbands, their sons, > the sons of their husbands, their brothers, the sons of their brothers, the > sons of their sisters, other women, the male servants or employees whose > sexual drive has been nullified, or the children who have not reached > puberty. They shall not strike their feet when they walk in order to shake > and reveal certain details of their bodies. All of you shall repent to GOD, > O you believers, that you may succeed.\\" (Quran 24:30-31) A number of hadith commenting on the above verse of the Qur'an (33:59) mention the jilbab. > Narrated Safiyah bint Shaibah: 'Aisha used to say: \\"When (the Verse): \\"They > should draw their jalabib over their necks and bosoms,\\" was revealed, (the > ladies) cut their waist sheets at the edges and covered their faces with the > cut pieces.\\" (Sahih Bukhari, Volume 6, Book 60, Number #282) > Narrated Umm Atiyya: We were ordered to bring out our menstruating women and > screened women to the religious gatherings and invocation of the Muslims on > the two Eid festivals. These menstruating women were to keep away from the > musalla. A woman asked, \\"O Messenger of Allah! What about one who does not > have a jilbab?\\". He said, \\"Let her borrow the jilbab of her companion\\". > (Sahih Bukhari, Book 8, #347) Overview Women wearing the traditional jilbƒÅb in the Medina quarter in Essaouira, Morocco. Since there are no pictures of 7th century jilbab, nor any surviving garments, it is not at all clear if the modern jilbab is the same garment as that referred to in the Qur'an. In general terms, jilbab is a garment/sheet that is worn on the head, draped around the body and that totally covers the body of the woman. Some modern Muslims insist that the contemporary jilbab and the garment described in the Qur'an and the hadith are exactly the same, and that the Qur'an therefore requires the believer to wear 'these' garments. Some scholars say that a veil is not compulsory in front of blind, asexual or gay men.Queer Spiritual Spaces: Sexuality and Sacred Places - Page 89, Kath Browne, Sally Munt, Andrew K. T. Yip - 2010 > The Encyclopedia of Islam identifies over a hundred terms for dress parts, > many of which are used for \\"veiling\\" (Encyclopedia of Islam 1986: 745‚Äì6). > Some of these and related Arabic terms are burqu, ‚Äòabayah, tarhah, bumus, > jilbab, jellabah, hayik, milayah, gallabiyyah, dishdasha, gargush, gins‚Äô, > mungub, lithma, yashmik, habarah, izar. A few terms refer to items used as > face covers only. These are qina, burqu, niqab, lithma. Others refer to > headcovers that are situationally held by the individual to cover part of > the face. These are khimar, sitara, abayah or inrrah.

There are two common kinds of dado sets, stacked dado set and wobble blade. Stacked dado set consists of two circular saw blades fixed on either side of a set of removable chippers. As the dado set spins, the two outside blades cut the dado walls and the chippers remove the waste material in between and smooth the bottom of the dado. The chippers are added or removed to the set as required to make a dado of the desired width. Chippers can also be interspersed with spacers to finely adjust the dado width. Consequently, changing the dado width requires the complete removal of the dado blade set from the arbor. After disassembly, chippers and/or spacers are used to achieve the desired width of the dado set. Wobble blade or wobble dado or adjustable dado consists of a circular blade mounted on an adjustable multi-piece hub, that varies the angle of the blade to the arbor shaft. The width of the dado cut increases as the angle gets farther from the radial normal (90¬∞) to the arbor. While it is possible to adjust the thickness of the cut while the saw is mounted on the arbor, accurate adjustment is usually difficult because tightening the arbor nut often changes the adjustment. Also, because of their inherent geometry wobble blades can only produce a flat-bottomed dado at one width setting, which may be a disadvantage in certain joinery operations. Another disadvantage of a wobble dado over stacked dado is undesirable vibrations. The magnitude of these vibrations varies with the blade's angular offset. In other words, the wider the dado, the stronger the vibrations. Dado cuts are also less likely to wear down over time, given that they are primarily designed to hold an inserted workpiece entirely still.

The station, which is owned by Steel City Radio, Inc., broadcasts at 1080 kHz with a daytime power of 50,000 watts (25,000 watts during critical hours). History WWNL was originally WILY, a station which primarily served an African American audience in the 1950s; in 1957 it became WEEP, a top 40 station, before switching to the call letters WYRE in 1961 (and then back to WEEP). Unable to compete with KQV in the format, WEEP changed to country music in 1965, in which it enjoyed its greatest success, and for which it is best remembered. The station format complemented its then (WDSY) FM sister station in the 1970s, which was originally WEEP-FM. Other than a one-year period with a news/talk format in 1976, WEEP aired a country format for almost three decades. By the 1980s, WEEP simulcasted WDSY part of the day, before flipping to an oldies format on December 15, 1986.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1980s/1987/RR-1987-01-02.pdf This would last until September 1990, when it adopted a failed all-business news and talk format that lasted until February 1992, when its call letters were changed to WDSY and the station became a full simulcast of its FM sister.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1992/RR-1992-02-07.pdf This was short-lived, as a management change resulted in a complete separation of programming between the two stations, with the station going back to the WEEP call letters and affiliating with ABC/SMN's \\"Real Country\\" format delivered via satellite in September 1992. It later returned to a full-time simulcast of the FM in March 1995, again as WDSY.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1993/RR-1993-03-26.pdf In April 1997, WDSY was sold and flipped formats to gospel music as WPGR. In July 1999, the format moved to 1510, and following two months of simulcasting, 1080 changed to WWNL and a Christian format. Starting out as a music-based station, WWNL has added more talk and paid programming in recent years. The WEEP call letters are now assigned to a defunct radio station in Virginia, Minnesota. The WYRE callsign was assigned to a very small 250-watt AM station on 810 kHz in Annapolis, Maryland. In the 1960s it broadcast a Top 40 format. Today it is a Spanish-language station.https://radiotime.com/station/s_24242/WYRE_810.aspx History of call letters The call letters WWNL were previously assigned to an AM station in Newport, Kentucky.

The most notable event came on June 14, 1870, when the Atlantics defeated the Cincinnati Red Stockings to end their historic 84-game winning streak. Fred Goldsmith successfully demonstrated his curve ball at the grounds in 1870, a pitch previously thought to have been only an optical illusion. In an 1865 game, Ned Cuthbert is credited with inventing the slide when he tried avoiding a tag when attempting to steal a base against the Athletic of Philadelphia. In addition to baseball, the grounds hosted various events and exhibitions; most notably in 1873, when Washington Donaldson and two reporters attempted to fly a hot-air balloon across the Atlantic Ocean. The attempt turned tragic when the balloon crashed in Connecticut killing one of the reporters. Origin and construction Reuben S. Decker inherited a portion of his grandfather's farm land and along with Hamilton A. Weed initially opened the Capitoline Skating pond, named in reference to Capitoline Hill, one of the Seven Hills of Rome.Nash, p. 115 The location of the grounds were in the Bedford area of Brooklyn, New York, an area now known as the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood.Batesel, p. 146 The grounds encompassed a city block bounded by Halsey Street, Marcy Street, Putnam Avenue, and Nostrand Avenue. The pond area was first conceived as an ice skate park, which began in the winter of 1862-1863. (Marcy also bordered the Union Grounds.) It was designed to be a competitor to the nearby Union Grounds, where the first enclosed baseball field opened earlier in 1862. With the success that the Union Grounds experienced by charging admission, Decker and Weed chose to enclose the Capitoline Grounds as well. The Capitoline Grounds opened for baseball in 1864, consisting of two sets of bleachers that were backed by Nostrand Avenue and Halsey Street, and had an approximate capacity of 5,000 people. In right field stood a circular brick outhouse, and if any player hit a ball over the structure, they were presented with a bottle of Champagne. Along Putnam Avenue, two rows of stables were established for the patrons' horses. Other amenities included a bandstand, clubhouses, and sitting rooms for the female patrons.McGee, p. 22 The Brooklyn Daily Eagle regarded the new park as \\"the finest, most extensive, and complete ball grounds in the country.\\"Mele, p. 56 The business ran year around; flooding the area during the winter for skating, then draining the park in the spring for baseball matches. Baseball1864‚Äì1868= The first team to use the grounds as their home field was the Atlantics of Brooklyn, baseball's most successful team since the formation of the National Association of Base Ball Players in 1857.McNeil, p. 425 The club had won the most games in 1857, then won the league's first three championships from 1859 to 1861. On May 5, 1864, the first baseball game at Capitoline was a match between the Atlantics and a field of nine players from other Brooklyn teams chosen by sportswriter Henry Chadwick. The Atlantic club defeated the field of nine, 45-11. Later, Atlantic defeated Nassau of Princeton 42‚Äì7 in the field's first scheduled club match. The Enterprise of Brooklyn used the grounds as their home field 1864, and the Excelsior of Brooklyn later moved there in 1866. Both the Enterprise and the Excelsior clubs refused to play the Atlantics, but they played a number of matches together, mixing their best nines and their \\"muffin\\" nines of club novices. The Atlantics won the NABBP championship in 1864 with an undefeated record. In early November 1865, the Atlantics played the Athletic of Philadelphia in a two-game, season-ending series. Brooklyn came into the series undefeated, and this was considered a play for the league's championship. The games were played one week apart, the first occurred in Philadelphia, which resulted in a 21-15 victory for Brooklyn. In the second game, played in Brooklyn in front of a crowd of approximately 15,000 spectators, the Atlantics prevailed, this time 27-24. The Atlantics won the championship again in 1866. =1869‚Äì1871= Sketch of Capitoline Grounds during a matchup of the Brooklyn Atlantics and the Cincinnati Red Stockings, 1870. On June 28, 1869, a championship match between the Atlantic club and the New York Mutuals was played on the Capitoline Grounds before a crowd of 10‚Äö000. The Atlantics were ahead in the seventh before the game was stopped due to rain. Later, on September 6, the Eckford Club began a championship series for the pennant with the Atlantic club at the Capitoline Grounds. With 8‚Äö000 spectators on hand, the Atlantics defeated the Eckfords 45-25‚Äö supported by Joe Start's four home runs. Due to other local competitors opening area that could hold more ballfields, the Capitoline Grounds split their field into two fields to accommodate more amateur clubs. The first instance of two high- profile teams to begin a season with a practice game happened at the grounds on April 21, 1870. A crowd of 1‚Äö200 paid $.25 apiece to watch the Atlantics and the Union of Morrisania play; the Atlantics won the game 24‚Äì10. The game played at the Capitoline Grounds on June 14, 1870, a match described both as the \\"greatest game of the year,\\" and \\"the finest game ever played\\" took place. With approximately 20,000 people in attendance, Harry Wright and the Cincinnati Red Stockings attempted to extend their 84-game winning streak against the Atlantics in Brooklyn. The Red Stockings had been undefeated in 1869, with a record of 57‚Äì0, and had won their first 27 games of the 1870 season.McGee, p. 23 The game was tied 5‚Äì5 at the end of the ninth inning, when the Atlantics offered to let the game end since the regulation nine innings had been played, but Wright turned down the proposal, wishing to take the game into extra innings. In the top of the 11th inning‚Äö the Red Stockings scored two runs, giving themselves a 7‚Äì5 lead, but the Atlantics countered with three of their own in the bottom half of the 11th, winning the game. Henry Chadwick wrote an account that on August 16, 1870, Fred Goldsmith demonstrated a new pitch, the curve ball, at the Capitoline Grounds.Morris, p. 420 Chadwick observed: \\"That which had up to this point been considered an optical illusion and against all rules of philosophy was now an established fact.\\" By the 1930s, the established baseball community had given the discovery credit to Candy Cummings, and due to Chapman's age, determined that his demonstration has most likely occurred a few years later. =1872‚Äì1880= The only season of Major League Baseball at the Capitoline Grounds was in 1872. The Atlantics, then of the National Association, won the final major league game there 6-3 over Boston, but left for the Union Grounds in 1873. The Capitoline Grounds continued to host lesser matches, as well such events as P.T. Barnum's circus, whose final show at Capitoline came in April 1880. John B. Day, who owned the New York Metropolitans in 1880, was frustrated about having to play at the ill-kept Capitoline Grounds in Brooklyn, which was not yet a borough of New York City, and the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge had not yet been completed, so the fans of the Mets had to cross the East River by ferry to see their team play. Day's shoe shine boy suggested a site in Manhattan, a place where polo matches were being played. That piece of ground later became the future site of the Polo Grounds. The Capitoline Grounds was demolished later in 1880. By the late winter of 1880-1881, the property had been cut by street and residential lot development had begun. Donaldson's failed balloon flight of 1873 In September 1873, Washington Donaldson, a professional balloonist who had formerly worked for P.T. Barnum as a circus performer, along with fellow balloonist John Wise, collaborated on an attempt to cross the Atlantic Ocean in a hot-air balloon. Sponsored by the Daily Graphic, the launch was to take place from the Capitoline Grounds, with Wise planning to use a balloon 49 meters (160 feet) tall with a two-compartment enclosed car, but decided to end his involvement with the project. Donaldson persisted, acquiring a smaller balloon with an open boat for the car. Donaldson's Atlantic attempt, launched from the Capitoline Grounds accompanied by reporters Alfred Ford and George Lunt, ended up being forced down by a rainstorm, to land on a Connecticut farm. Donaldson and Ford successfully abandoned the runaway balloon, but Lunt stayed with the balloon for a distance until he finally jumped into a tree, sustaining serious injuries from which he died six months later. Donaldson later disappeared in 1875 when he tried to fly across Lake Michigan in a balloon, accompanied by a reporter named Newton Grimwood. The balloon never made it to the far shore; Grimwood's body washed up on shore weeks later, but Donaldson was never seen again. In literature In Darryl Brock's 1990 novel, If I Never Get Back: A Novel, the main character is transported back in time to 1869, where he joins the Cincinnati Red Stockings on their quest to remain undefeated. The Red Stockings travelled to Brooklyn to play the Atlantics at the Capitoline Grounds.Brock, p. 128 ReferencesBibliography    Category:Defunct baseball venues in the United States Category:Sports venues in Brooklyn Category:Baseball venues in New York City Category:Former sports venues in New York City Category:Demolished sports venues in New York (state) Category:Sports venues completed in 1864 Category:1864 establishments in New York (state) Category:1880 disestablishments in New York (state) Category:Sports venues demolished in 1880 ","title":"Capitoline Grounds"},{"id":"2735704","text":"The Madras treeshrew (Anathana ellioti), also known as the Indian treeshrew, is a species of treeshrew in the monotypic genus Anathana found in the hill forests of central and southern India. The genus name is derived from the Tamil name of moongil anathaan (literally \\"bamboo squirrel\\") and the species name is after Sir Walter Elliot of the Indian Civil Services in Madras. Description A. e. ellioti from alt= This treeshrew is 16.0 to 18.5 cm long with a tail of 16.5 to 19.5 cm. The nominate race (type locality: Eastern Ghats, Madras. British Museum 50.1.21.5) has the tail coloured like the back, the ground colour above being reddish-brown while the feet and hind legs are buff or ochraceous. The other two races have the tail coloured differently from the back. The race A. e. pallida (type locality: Manbhum, Bengal, collected by Robert Cecil Beavan British Museum 66.12.28.2) has the colour of body above reddish-brown and the feet and hind legs grizzled buffy. Race A. e. wroughtoni (type locality: Mandvi, Surat, collected by R. C. Wroughton British Museum 96.11.7.1) has the colour of body above dull grizzled brownish and the feet and hind legs grizzled greyish. Some later workers lump all the three races. Its dental formula is . The dentition is suited for an omnivorous diet. Some authors have suggested this species could be included within the genus Tupaia, although most have kept the genus separate based on anatomical differences. Distribution The Madras treeshrew is found on the Indian Subcontinent south of the Ganges River. Three subspecies have been described -- A. e. ellioti of the Eastern Ghats, Biligirirangan and the Shevaroy Hills and other hills of Southern India, A. e. pallida from Central India primarily in Madhya Pradesh and Raipur, and A. e. wroughtoni from the Satpura Range and the Dangs near Bombay. They have been reported within the Western Ghats ranges of Wayanad (Periya) and Mahabaleshwar. The northernmost record is from Garhwa district of Bihar. Little is known about the status of these populations as the distribution is patchy, but S. M. Mohnot considered them as \\"common\\" in 1975. Behaviour and ecology WWF-US. September 1992 pages 40 This species of treeshrew is not particularly arboreal and spends much of its time on the ground or clambering about on rocky terrain in the search of insects and seeds. It is easily separated from the squirrels in the field by the shape and color of the tail and the upward curve in which it is held when walking about. They have a behaviour of climbing up low, slanting trunks and sliding down headfirst.Chorazyna, H., G. Kurup. 1975. Observations on the Ecology and Behaviour of Anathana ellioti in the Wild. Contemporary Primatology: 5th International Congress of Primatology: 342-344. This may be associated with scent marking, as many of the Scandentia have scent glands on their throats. A species of sucking louse Docophthirus acinetus is found only on this species, the genus itself being restricted to hosts in the family Tupaiidae. Endoparasitic microfiliriae have also been described from the species. The Crested Hawk-eagle (Nisaetus cirrhatus) has been known to prey on this tree shrew.Sirdesai, V., M. Ali, and M. S. R.

Named after Maurice Fr√©chet, it is commonly used to generalize the derivative of a real-valued function of a single real variable to the case of a vector-valued function of multiple real variables, and to define the functional derivative used widely in the calculus of variations. Generally, it extends the idea of the derivative from real-valued functions of one real variable to functions on Banach spaces. The Fr√©chet derivative should be contrasted to the more general Gateaux derivative which is a generalization of the classical directional derivative. The Fr√©chet derivative has applications to nonlinear problems throughout mathematical analysis and physical sciences, particularly to the calculus of variations and much of nonlinear analysis and nonlinear functional analysis.  Definition  Let V and W be normed vector spaces, and U\\\\subset V be an open subset of V. A function f : U ‚Üí W is called Fr√©chet differentiable at x \\\\in U if there exists a bounded linear operator A:V\\\\to W such that :\\\\lim_{\\\\h\\\\ \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{ \\\\ f(x + h) - f(x) - Ah \\\\_{W} }{ \\\\h\\\\_{V} } = 0. The limit here is meant in the usual sense of a limit of a function defined on a metric space (see Functions on metric spaces), using V and W as the two metric spaces, and the above expression as the function of argument h in V. As a consequence, it must exist for all sequences \\\\langle h_n\\\\rangle_{n=1}^{\\\\infty} of non-zero elements of V that converge to the zero vector h_n \\\\to 0. Equivalently, the first-order expansion holds, in Landau notation : f(x + h) = f(x) + Ah +o(h). If there exists such an operator A, it is unique, so we write Df(x)=A and call it the Fr√©chet derivative of f at x. A function f that is Fr√©chet differentiable for any point of U is said to be C1 if the function :Df:U\\\\to B(V,W) ; x \\\\mapsto Df(x) is continuous (B(V,W) denotes the space of all bounded linear operators from V to W). Note that this is not the same as requiring that the map Df(x) : V \\\\to W be continuous for each value of x (which is assumed; bounded and continuous are equivalent). This notion of derivative is a generalization of the ordinary derivative of a function on the real numbers f:\\\\R\\\\to\\\\R since the linear maps from \\\\R to \\\\R are just multiplication by a real number. In this case, Df(x) is the function t \\\\mapsto f'(x)t .  Properties  A function differentiable at a point is continuous at that point. Differentiation is a linear operation in the following sense: if f and g are two maps V ‚Üí W which are differentiable at x, and r and s are scalars (two real or complex numbers), then rf + sg is differentiable at x with D(rf + sg)(x) = rDf(x) + sDg(x). The chain rule is also valid in this context: if f : U ‚Üí Y is differentiable at x in U, and g : Y ‚Üí W is differentiable at y = f(x), then the composition g o f is differentiable in x and the derivative is the composition of the derivatives: :D(g \\\\circ f)(x) = Dg(f(x))\\\\circ Df(x).  Finite dimensions  The Fr√©chet derivative in finite-dimensional spaces is the usual derivative. In particular, it is represented in coordinates by the Jacobian matrix. Suppose that f is a map, f:U\\\\sub\\\\R^n\\\\to\\\\R^m with U an open set. If f is Fr√©chet differentiable at a point a ‚àà U, then its derivative is :\\\\begin{cases} Df(a): \\\\R^n \\\\to \\\\R^m  Df(a)(v) = J_f(a) v \\\\end{cases} where Jf(a) denotes the Jacobian matrix of f at a. Furthermore, the partial derivatives of f are given by : \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x_i}(a) = Df(a)(e_i) = J_f(a) e_i, where {ei} is the canonical basis of \\\\R^n. Since the derivative is a linear function, we have for all vectors h \\\\in \\\\R^n that the directional derivative of f along h is given by : Df(a)(h) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} h_i \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x_i}(a). If all partial derivatives of f exist and are continuous, then f is Fr√©chet differentiable (and, in fact, C1). The converse is not true; the function : f(x, y)= \\\\begin{cases} (x^2+y^2)\\\\sin \\\\left ((x^2+y^2)^{-1/2} \\\\right ) & (x, y) e (0, 0) 0 & (x, y)=(0, 0) \\\\end{cases} is Fr√©chet differentiable and yet fails to have continuous partial derivatives at (0,0).  Example in infinite dimensions  One of the simplest (nontrivial) examples in infinite dimensions, is the one where the domain is a Hilbert space (H) and the function in interest is the norm. So consider \\\\\\\\cdot\\\\:H\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}. First assume that x e 0. Then we claim that the Fr√©chet derivative of \\\\\\\\cdot\\\\ at x is the linear functional D, defined by :Dv:=\\\\left\\\\langle v,\\\\frac{x}{\\\\x\\\\}\\\\right\\\\rangle. Indeed, :\\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{\\\\x+h\\\\-\\\\x\\\\-Dh}{\\\\h\\\\} &=\\\\frac{\\\\x\\\\\\\\x+h\\\\-\\\\langle x,x\\\\rangle-\\\\langle x,h\\\\rangle}{\\\\x\\\\\\\\h\\\\} \\\\[8pt] &=\\\\frac{\\\\x\\\\\\\\x+h\\\\-\\\\langle x,x+h\\\\rangle}{\\\\x\\\\\\\\h\\\\} \\\\[8pt] &=\\\\frac{\\\\langle x,x\\\\rangle \\\\langle x+h,x+h\\\\rangle-\\\\langle x,x+h\\\\rangle^2}{\\\\x\\\\\\\\h\\\\(\\\\x\\\\\\\\x+h\\\\+\\\\langle x,x+h\\\\rangle)} \\\\[8pt] &=\\\\frac{\\\\langle x,x \\\\rangle \\\\langle h,h \\\\rangle-\\\\langle x,h \\\\rangle^2}{\\\\x\\\\\\\\h\\\\(\\\\x\\\\\\\\x+h\\\\+\\\\langle x,x+h\\\\rangle)}  &{} \\\\end{align} Using continuity of the norm and inner product we obtain: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\lim_{h\\\\to 0}\\\\frac{\\\\x+h\\\\-\\\\x\\\\-Dh}{\\\\h\\\\} &= \\\\lim_{h\\\\to 0} \\\\frac{\\\\langle x,x \\\\rangle \\\\langle h,h \\\\rangle-\\\\langle x,h \\\\rangle^2}{\\\\x\\\\\\\\h\\\\(\\\\x\\\\\\\\x+h\\\\+\\\\langle x,x+h\\\\rangle)} \\\\[8pt] &= \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\x\\\\^3}\\\\lim_{h\\\\to 0}\\\\frac{\\\\langle x,x \\\\rangle \\\\langle h,h \\\\rangle-\\\\langle x,h \\\\rangle^2}{\\\\h\\\\} \\\\[8pt] &= \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\x\\\\^3}\\\\lim_{h\\\\to 0}\\\\left(\\\\langle x,x\\\\rangle\\\\h\\\\-\\\\langle x,h\\\\rangle \\\\left\\\\langle x,\\\\frac{h}{\\\\h\\\\}\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\right) \\\\[8pt] &= \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\x\\\\^3}\\\\left(\\\\lim_{h\\\\to 0}\\\\langle x,x\\\\rangle\\\\h\\\\-\\\\lim_{h\\\\to 0}\\\\langle x,h\\\\rangle \\\\left\\\\langle x,\\\\frac{h}{\\\\h\\\\}\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\right ) \\\\[8pt] &= \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\x\\\\^3}\\\\left(0-\\\\lim_{h\\\\to 0}\\\\langle x,h\\\\rangle \\\\left\\\\langle x,\\\\frac{h}{\\\\h\\\\}\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\right ) \\\\[8pt] &= -\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\x\\\\^3}\\\\left(\\\\lim_{h\\\\to 0}\\\\langle x,h\\\\rangle \\\\left\\\\langle x,\\\\frac{h}{\\\\h\\\\}\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\right ) \\\\[8pt] \\\\end{align} As h\\\\to 0, \\\\langle x,h\\\\rangle \\\\to 0 and because of the Cauchy-Bunyakovsky-Schwarz inequality :\\\\left\\\\langle x,\\\\frac{h}{\\\\h\\\\}\\\\right\\\\rangle is bounded by \\\\x\\\\ thus the whole limit vanishes. Now we show that at x=0 the norm is not differentiable, i.e. there does not exist bounded linear functional D such that the limit in question to be 0. Let D be any linear functional. Riesz representation theorem tells us that D could be defined by Dv=\\\\langle a,v\\\\rangle for some a\\\\in H. Consider :A(h)=\\\\frac{\\\\0+h\\\\-\\\\0\\\\-Dh}{\\\\h\\\\}=\\\\left1-\\\\left\\\\langle a,\\\\frac{h}{\\\\h\\\\}\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\right. In order for the norm to be differentiable at 0 we must have :\\\\lim_{h\\\\to 0}A(h)=0. We will show that this is not true for any a. If a=0 obviously A(h)=1 independently of h, hence this is not the derivative. Assume a e 0. If we take h tending to zero in the direction of -a (i.e. h=t\\\\cdot(-a), where t \\\\to 0 ^{+}) then A(h)=1+\\\\a\\\\>1>0, hence :\\\\lim_{h\\\\to 0} A(h) e 0 (If we take h tending to zero in the direction of a we would even see this limit does not exist since in this case we will obtain 1-\\\\a\\\\). The result just obtained agrees with the results in finite dimensions.  Relation to the Gateaux derivative  A function f : U ‚äÇ V ‚Üí W is called Gateaux differentiable at x ‚àà U if f has a directional derivative along all directions at x. This means that there exists a function such that :g(h)=\\\\lim_{t \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{ f(x + th) - f(x) }{ t } for any chosen vector h in V, and where t is from the scalar field associated with V (usually, t is real).It is common to include in the definition that the resulting map g must be a continuous linear operator. We avoid adopting this convention here to allow examination of the widest possible class of pathologies. If f is Fr√©chet differentiable at x, it is also Gateaux differentiable there, and g is just the linear operator A = Df(x). However, not every Gateaux differentiable function is Fr√©chet differentiable. This is analogous to the fact that the existence of all directional derivatives at a point does not guarantee total differentiability (or even continuity) at that point. For example, the real-valued function f of two real variables defined by :f(x, y)= \\\\begin{cases} \\\\frac{x^3}{x^2+y^2} & (x, y) e (0, 0) 0 & (x, y)=(0, 0) \\\\end{cases} is continuous and Gateaux differentiable at (0, 0), with its derivative being :g(a, b)=\\\\begin{cases} \\\\frac{a^3}{a^2+b^2}& (a, b) e (0, 0) 0 & (a, b)=(0, 0) \\\\end{cases} The function g is not a linear operator, so this function is not Fr√©chet differentiable. More generally, any function of the form f(x,y) = g (r) h (\\\\phi), where r and œÜ are the polar coordinates of (x,y), is continuous and Gateaux differentiable at (0,0) if g is differentiable at 0 and h(\\\\phi + \\\\pi) = -h(\\\\phi), but the Gateaux derivative is only linear and the Fr√©chet derivative only exists if h is sinusoidal. In another situation, the function f given by :f(x, y)= \\\\begin{cases} \\\\frac{x^3y}{x^6+y^2} & (x, y) e (0, 0) 0 & (x, y)=(0, 0) \\\\end{cases} is Gateaux differentiable at (0, 0), with its derivative there being g(a, b) = 0 for all (a, b), which is a linear operator. However, f is not continuous at (0, 0) (one can see by approaching the origin along the curve (t, t3)) and therefore f cannot be Fr√©chet differentiable at the origin. A more subtle example is :f(x, y)= \\\\begin{cases} \\\\frac{x^2y}{x^4+y^2}\\\\sqrt{x^2+y^2} & (x, y) e (0, 0) 0 & (x, y)=(0, 0) \\\\end{cases} which is a continuous function that is Gateaux differentiable at (0, 0), with its derivative being g(a, b) = 0 there, which is again linear. However, f is not Fr√©chet differentiable. If it were, its Fr√©chet derivative would coincide with its Gateaux derivative, and hence would be the zero operator; hence the limit :\\\\lim_{(x,y)\\\\to(0,0)}\\\\left\\\\frac{x^2y}{x^4+y^2}\\\\right would have to be zero, whereas approaching the origin along the curve (t, t2) shows that this limit does not exist. These cases can occur because the definition of the Gateaux derivative only requires that the difference quotients converge along each direction individually, without making requirements about the rates of convergence for different directions. Thus, for a given Œµ, although for each direction the difference quotient is within Œµ of its limit in some neighborhood of the given point, these neighborhoods may be different for different directions, and there may be a sequence of directions for which these neighborhoods become arbitrarily small. If a sequence of points is chosen along these directions, the quotient in the definition of the Fr√©chet derivative, which considers all directions at once, may not converge. Thus, in order for a linear Gateaux derivative to imply the existence of the Fr√©chet derivative, the difference quotients have to converge uniformly for all directions. The following example only works in infinite dimensions. Let X be a Banach space, and œÜ a linear functional on X that is discontinuous at x = 0 (a discontinuous linear functional). Let :f(x) = \\\\x\\\\\\\\varphi(x). Then f(x) is Gateaux differentiable at x = 0 with derivative 0\\\\. However, f(x) is not Fr√©chet differentiable since the limit :\\\\lim_{x\\\\to 0}\\\\varphi(x) does not exist.  Higher derivatives  If is a differentiable function at all points in an open subset U of V, it follows that its derivative :D f : U \\\\to L(V, W) is a function from U to the space of all bounded linear operators from V to W. This function may also have a derivative, the second order derivative of f, which, by the definition of derivative, will be a map :D^2 f : U \\\\to L\\\\big(V, L(V, W)\\\\big). To make it easier to work with second-order derivatives, the space on the right-hand side is identified with the Banach space of all continuous bilinear maps from V to W. An element œÜ in is thus identified with œà in such that for all x and y in V, :\\\\varphi(x)(y)=\\\\psi(x, y). (Intuitively: a function œÜ linear in x with œÜ(x) linear in y is the same as a bilinear function œà in x and y). One may differentiate :D^2 f : U \\\\to L^2(V\\\\times V, W) again, to obtain the third order derivative, which at each point will be a trilinear map, and so on. The n-th derivative will be a function :D^n f : U \\\\to L^n(V\\\\times V\\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times V, W), taking values in the Banach space of continuous multilinear maps in n arguments from V to W. Recursively, a function f is times differentiable on U if it is n times differentiable on U and for each x in U there exists a continuous multilinear map A of arguments such that the limit :\\\\lim_{h_{n+1} \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{ \\\\left \\\\ D^nf \\\\left(x + h_{n+1} \\\\right )(h_1, h_2, \\\\ldots, h_n) - D^nf(x)(h_1, h_2, \\\\ldots, h_n) - A \\\\left (h_1, h_2, \\\\ldots, h_n, h_{n+1} \\\\right ) \\\\right \\\\ }{ \\\\h_{n+1}\\\\ } = 0 exists uniformly for h1, h2, ..., hn in bounded sets in V. In that case, A is the st derivative of f at x. Moreover, we may obviously identify a member of the space L^n(V\\\\times V\\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times V, W) with a linear map L(\\\\bigotimes_{j=1}^n V_j, W) through the identification f(x_1,x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n) = f(x_1 \\\\otimes x_2 \\\\otimes \\\\cdots \\\\otimes x_n) , thus viewing the derivative as a linear map.  Partial Fr√©chet derivatives  In this section, we extend the usual notion of partial derivatives which is defined for functions of the form f: \\\\R^n \\\\to \\\\R , to functions whose domains and target spaces are arbitrary (real or complex) Banach spaces. To do this, let V_1, \\\\dots, V_n and W be Banach spaces (over the same field of scalars), and let f: \\\\prod_{i=1}^n V_i \\\\to W be a given function, and fix a point a = (a_1, \\\\dots, a_n) \\\\in \\\\prod_{i=1}^n V_i . We say that f has an i-th partial differential at the point a if the function \\\\varphi_i : V_i \\\\to W defined by : \\\\varphi_i(x) = f(a_1, \\\\dots, a_{i-1}, x, a_{i+1}, \\\\dots a_n) is Fr√©chet differentiable at the point a_i (in the sense described above). In this case, we define \\\\partial_if(a) := D\\\\varphi_i(a_i) , and we call \\\\partial_if(a) the i-th partial derivative of f at the point a . It is important to note that \\\\partial_if(a) is a linear transformation from V_i into W . Heuristically, if f has an i-th partial differential at a , then \\\\partial_if(a) linearly approximates the change in the function f when we fix all of its entries to be a_j for j eq i , and we only vary the i-th entry. We can express this in the Landau notation as : f(a_1, \\\\dots, a_i+h, \\\\dots a_n) - f(a_1, \\\\dots, a_n) = \\\\partial_if(a)(h) + o(h).  Generalization to topological vector spaces  The notion of the Fr√©chet derivative can be generalized to arbitrary topological vector spaces (TVS) X and Y. Letting U be an open subset of X that contains the origin and given a function f: U \\\\to Y such that f(0) = 0, we first define what it means for this function to have 0 as its derivative. We say that this function f is tangent to 0 if for every open neighborhood of 0, W \\\\sub Y there exists an open neighborhood of 0, V\\\\sub X and a function o: \\\\R \\\\to \\\\R such that :\\\\lim_{t\\\\to 0} \\\\frac{o(t)}{t} = 0, and for all t in some neighborhood of the origin, f(tV) \\\\sub o(t) W. We can now remove the constraint that f(0) = 0 by defining f to be Fr√©chet differentiable at a point x_0 \\\\in U if there exists a continuous linear operator \\\\lambda : X \\\\to Y such that f(x_0 + h) - f(x_0) - \\\\lambda h, considered as a function of h, is tangent to 0. (Lang p. 6) If the Fr√©chet derivative exists then it is unique. Furthermore, the Gateaux derivative must also exist and be equal the Fr√©chet derivative in that for all v \\\\in X, : \\\\lim_{\\\\tau \\\\to 0}\\\\frac{f(x_0 + \\\\tau v) - f(x_0)}{\\\\tau} = f'(x_0) v, where f'(x_0) is the Fr√©chet derivative. A function that is Fr√©chet differentiable at a point is necessarily continuous there and sums and scalar multiples of Fr√©chet differentiable functions are differentiable so that the space of functions that are Fr√©chet differentiable at a point form a subspace of the functions that are continuous at that point. The chain rule also holds as does the Leibniz rule whenever Y is an algebra and a TVS in which multiplication is continuous.

He was one of Latin America's most important Romantic authors. Life Echeverr√≠a spent five decisive years in Paris (1825 to 1830), where he absorbed the spirit of the Romantic Movement, then in its heyday in France. He became one of the movement's promoters once he returned to Argentina. Once he returned to Buenos Aires, he wrote \\"Los Consuelos\\" in 1834 and \\"Las rimas\\" in 1837. He was a member of the group of young Argentine intellectuals who in 1840 organized the Asociaci√≥n de Mayo (\\"May Association\\", after the May Revolution that initiated Argentina's move towards independence). This institution aspired to develop a national literature responsive to the country's social and physical reality. Echeverr√≠a also devoted himself to the overthrow of the caudillo of Buenos Aires, Juan Manuel de Rosas. In 1840 he was forced to go into exile in nearby Uruguay, where he wrote La Insurrecci√≥n del Sur and El Matadero. He remained in Uruguay until his death in 1851. His remains are said to be buried at Buceo Cemetery.Radio Cultura Work Echeverr√≠a's renown as a writer rests largely on his powerful short story El matadero (\\"The Slaughter Yard\\", often mistranslated as \\"The Slaughterhouse\\"), written in sometime during 1838-1840 but not published until 1871), a landmark in the history of Latin American literature. It is mostly significant because it displays the perceived clash between \\"civilization and barbarism\\", that is, between the European and the \\"primitive and violent\\" American ways. Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, another great Argentine writer and thinker, saw this clash as the core of Latin American culture. Read in this light, \\"The Slaughterhouse\\" is a political allegory. Its more specific intention was to accuse Rosas of protecting the kind of thugs who murder the cultivated young protagonist at the Buenos Aires slaughterhouse. Rosas and his henchmen stand for barbarism, the slain young man for civilization. Echeverr√≠a's La cautiva (\\"The Captive\\"), a long narrative poem about a white woman abducted by Mapuche Indians, is also among the better-known works of 19th-century Latin American literature.

Written by Herman Raucher, it tells the story of an extremely bigoted 1960s-era white insurance salesman named Jeff Gerber, who wakes up one morning to find that he has become black. The premise for the film was inspired by Franz Kafka's Metamorphosis, and by John Howard Griffin's autobiographical Black Like Me. Van Peebles' only studio film, Watermelon Man was a financial success, but Van Peebles did not accept Columbia Pictures' three-picture contract, instead developing the independent film Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song. The music for Watermelon Man, written and performed by Van Peebles, was released on a soundtrack album, which spawned the single \\"Love, That's America\\". Plot Jeff Gerber lives in an average suburban neighborhood with his seemingly liberal housewife Althea, who tolerates her husband's character flaws out of love. Every morning when Jeff wakes up, he spends some time under a tanning machine, hits the speedbag, drinks a health drink, and races the bus to work on foot. Jeff presents himself as happy-go-lucky and quite a joker, but others tend to see him as obnoxious and boorish. Althea, who watches the race riots every night on TV with great interest, chastises Jeff for not having sympathy for the problems of black Americans. One morning, Jeff wakes up to find that his pigment has changed. He tries to fall back asleep, thinking that it is a dream, but to no avail. He tries taking a shower to wash the \\"black\\" off him, but finds it does not work, when Althea walks into the bathroom, and screams. He explains to her that the \\"Negro in the bathroom\\" is him. At first, Jeff believes this to be the result of spending too much time under the tanning machine. He spends almost the entire day at home, afraid to go out of the house, only going out once to venture into the \\"colored part of town\\" in order to find a pharmacy to buy \\"the stuff they use in order to make themselves look white.\\" His attempts to change his skin color fail. The next day, he is persuaded to get up and go to work. Things start out well at first, until Jeff is accused of robbery while running alongside the bus to work. The policeman assumes that, since he is a black man, he must have stolen something. During his lunch break, he makes an appointment with his doctor who cannot explain Jeff's condition either. After several calls, the doctor suggests that Jeff might be more comfortable with a black doctor. Returning home, he finds Althea afraid to answer the phone. He does not understand why until he receives a call from a man who uses racial slurs. At work the next day, a secretary (who had previously ignored him) makes several advances toward him, finding him more attractive as a black man. Jeff's boss suggests that they could drum up extra business with a \\"Negro\\" salesman. At home one evening, he finds the people who had made the threatening phone calls are neighbors who offer him $50,000 for his home due to fear of property depreciation. Jeff manages to raise the price to $100,000. Althea sends the children to live with a relative and later leaves her husband. He sleeps with the secretary only to discover she's developed a black fetish and therefore a racist and after he calls her out, she uses slurs towards him. Finally accepting the fact that he is black, Jeff resigns his regular job, buys an apartment building, and starts his own insurance company. The very last scene shows him practicing martial arts with a group of black menial workers, apparently having become one of the militants he used to put down. Production Herman Raucher wrote the script on spec in 1969, after realizing that several of his friends who espoused liberal sympathies still admitted to holding on to racist ideologies. Columbia Pictures liked the idea but were afraid to make the film without a black director; they hired Van Peebles based on his film Story of a Three Day Pass. Godfrey Cambridge plays the role of Jeff Gerber in whiteface for the first few minutes of the film, and then goes without the makeup when his character changes into a black man. Before Van Peebles had come into the project, the studio had told him that they were planning to cast a white actor like Alan Arkin or Jack Lemmon to play the part. Van Peebles suggested that they cast a black actor instead.Van Peebles, Melvin. Watermelon Man DVD, Columbia Tristar Home Entertainment, 2004, DVD introduction. ASIN: B0002KPI1O Raucher and Van Peebles frequently clashed on set, as Raucher intended the movie to be a satire of white, liberal America, whereas Van Peebles wanted to change Raucher's script to make it a black power movie. Raucher ended up novelizing his own screenplay to ensure that his original vision for the story survived in some form. Writing the book himself also ensured that Van Peebles could not enact a clause in his contract that would have allowed him to write it.Fassel, Preston. Resurrecting Herman Raucher. Cinedump.com. Retrieved 27 January 2017. On the film's DVD release, Van Peebles says that Raucher wanted the film to end with Gerber waking up to discover that the events of the movie had only been a nightmare, and convinced studio executives to allow him to film two alternate endings. Per Van Peebles he only filmed the current ending of the movie, forgetting to shoot the \\"it was all a dream\\" ending \\"by accident.\\" Raucher's novelization of his own script, however, includes the \\"workout\\" ending. Reception Columbia was happy with the finished product, and the film was a financial success, leading the studio to offer Van Peebles a three- picture contract. Instead of taking their offer, Van Peebles made the independent film Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song, which later turned out to not only be the highest-grossing independent film of 1971, but also the highest-grossing independent film up to that point. Following that film's success, Columbia rescinded Van Peebles' contract offer. In an analysis of Watermelon Man in Film Quarterly, scholar Raquel Gates describes it as a \\"cunning subversion of Hollywood and television conventions.\\" Soundtrack Van Peebles wrote the music to Watermelon Man himself, in order to have creative control. A soundtrack album was released in 1970, and \\"Love, That's America\\", a song from the film and soundtrack, was released as a single in the same year. The single was mentioned as a top pick in Billboard Magazine's Oct 31, 1970 issue. The song is narrated from the point of view of someone walking around America, and seeing \\"people run through the streets, blood streaming from where they been beat\\", and declaring \\"naw, this ain't America, you can't fool me\\". The soundtrack album was never released on compact disc, although it was released as a digital download through Amazon MP3 and iTunes. ;Track listing See also * List of American films of 1970  References External links  * Category:1970 comedy films Category:1970 films Category:American comedy films Category:American films Category:American satirical films Category:Columbia Pictures films Category:English-language films Category:Films about race and ethnicity Category:Films about racism Category:Films directed by Melvin Van Peebles Category:Films with screenplays by Herman Raucher ","title":"Watermelon Man (film)"},{"id":"2735756","text":"Sir Walter Elliot. Sir Walter Elliot, KCSI (16 January 1803 ‚Äì 1 March 1887) was a British civil servant in Colonial India. He was also an eminent orientalist, linguist, archaeologist, naturalist and ethnologist who worked mainly in the Presidency of Madras. Born in Edinburgh, he studied at the East India Company College at Haileybury and joined the East India Company's civil service at Madras in 1820 and worked on till 1860. He was invested Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India (KCSI) in 1866. Early life Elliot was born in 1803 at Edinburgh, son of James Elliot of Wolfelee and Caroline (n√©e Hunter). His early education was under a private tutor and he later was at school near Doncaster. He then went to Haileybury College, with a recommendation from his aunt, the widow of the twelfth Lord Elphinstone, graduated with \\"high distinction\\", and in January 1819 took up an appointment in the East India Company's Civil Service as a \\"writer\\". The post was secured through the influence of his great-uncle William Fullerton Elphinstone, the Company's director. He landed in Madras on 14 June 1820. India Elliot's training continued at the college at Fort St George, Madras ,where he excelled in languages, winning an award of 1000 pagodas for his proficiency in Tamil and Hindustani. He later learned other languages: Marathi, Arabic, Persian and Telugu. For two years he worked as an assistant to the collector of Salem district. He then arranged with Sir Thomas Munro and Mountstuart Elphinstone to be transferred into the newly acquired territory of southern Maratha district. In 1824 Elliot was caught up in the Kittur insurrection, which tried to take over a territory then under the control of Kittur Chennamma. He was taken prisoner, while his superior, St John Thackeray, the political agent of Dharwar (and uncle of William Makepeace Thackeray), was killed. Elliot and an assistant Stevenson were held in imprisonment for six weeks. They received good treatment from their captors, and it was during this period that he learnt about Hindu ideas of kinship, caste and custom. The southern Maratha district was subsequently moved from the control of the Madras to the Bombay Presidency but he was allowed to stay on by the governor of Bombay, Sir John Malcolm. During this period he gained a reputation as an adventurer, historian, big-game hunter and linguist.  Period in England  Elliot left for England on 11 December 1833 accompanied by Robert Pringle of the Bombay civil service. They sailed through the Red Sea and rode across the desert from Al-Qusayr to Thebes; and then sailed down the Nile to Cairo before visiting Constantinople, Athens, Corfu and Rome. They reached England on 5 May 1835. In 1836 Elliot's cousin John Elphinstone, 13th Lord Elphinstone was appointed Governor of the Madras Presidency. Elliott took up a post as his private secretary, and the two sailed together on a yacht, the Prince Regent which was gifted to them by the imam of Muscat. They arrived in Madras in February 1837. Return to India Elliot worked with Elphinstone until the latter's retirement in September 1842. Elphinstone's successor, George Hay, 8th Marquess of Tweeddale, found Elliot working in a whole range of capacities, and well beyond his position as a private secretary. He held also a position as a translator (of Canarese) to the Government. Elliot was then employed in the board of revenue. In 1845 he was appointed to examine Guntur district which had been hit by the major famine of 1833 and had not shown signs of recovery. Elliot found deep-seated corruption and collusion between village elites, local revenue officials, and five zamindar families that held most of the land in the district. The East India Company's court of directors were impressed by his work and appointed him commissioner of the Northern Circars, a position of responsibility that he managed until 1854 when he became a Member of the Council of the Governor of Madras. During 1858, Elliot temporarily replaced George Harris, 3rd Baron Harris and Governor of the Madras Presidency as the provisional governor; it fell to him to announce that following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the Honourable East India Company's responsibilities would be transferred to the The Crown, beginning the British Raj. Towards the end of his life Elliott began to lose his sight and in his later years was completely blind. He retired from service in 1859. Research While in India Elliot maintained a diary with notes on a range of subjects. He also wrote to the journals of scholarly societies. In 1859 he published Flora Andhrica, or plants of the Northern Circars which included the names of plants in Telugu and English. In 1840 he wrote on the 'cromlechs and cairns' in the Nilgiri hills. In 1845 he excavated and collected the Amaravati Marbles which were at one time called the \\"Elliot Marbles\\" and were exhibited in Madras. These marbles eventually went to the British Museum.Photos of the Elliot Marbles, Linnaeus Tripe, British Library, retrieved 19 December 2013 Elliot studied ancient inscriptions, beliefs and cultures. He was a keen numismatist and collector of coins and his main work on the topic was published in 1885, at a time when unable to see, he had to feel the coins to describe them and have written by a scribe for his Coins of Southern India. Anathana ellioti named after Elliot by George Robert Waterhouse, the genus name is derived from Tamil. He took an interest in the local zoology and spent considerable time outdoors in his early years in India. He was in correspondence with Charles Darwin and at his request he sent him skins of various domestic birds from India and Burma in 1856. He also collaborated with naturalists in India like Thomas C. Jerdon. He collected specimens of molluscs, beached whales and dolphins and a range of other species which were examined by experts in Britain like Richard Owen. He catalogued the mammals of southern India in the Madras Journal of Literature and Science and described several new species of small mammals. The rat species Golunda ellioti and the Madras tree-shrew Anathana ellioti are named after him. W. T. Blanford wrote to him \\"[V]ery little work is now done on mammals in India. Everybody has gone into ornithology. So far as I am aware your paper in the Madras journal is the only good account ...\\" Two species of Indian reptiles are named after him: Monilesaurus ellioti and Uropeltis ellioti.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (\\"Elliot, W.\\", p. 82). Elliot's home in Randals Road, Vepery, Madras was a focal point for scholars in the region. He encouraged many other oriental researchers including Ferdinand Kittel and Robert Caldwell. Back in Scotland, his family home became a veritable museum, and he was active until the day of his death. On 1 March 1887 he dictated and signed a letter to George Pope, expressing his enthusiasm for a new edition of Pope's translation of the Tamil Kural. He died the same evening. Retirement in Scotland Sir Walter and Maria Dorothea Elliot's grave in Chesters Church Elliot returned to Wolfelee in Roxburghshire in 1860, where he continued his researches. In 1866 he was made Knight Commander of the Star of India. In 1878 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He was awarded LL.D. of the University of Edinburgh in 1879. In 1874 he contributed an obituary of Thomas C. Jerdon to the journal Nature which was however not published for want of space. In his county, he continued to serve as deputy lieutenant and a magistrate. A memorial tablet was erected in the Parish Church of Hobkirk with an epitaph by Colonel Henry Yule. Family On 15 January 1839, he married Maria Dorothea Hunter Blair (c.1816‚Äì1890), daughter of Sir David Hunter-Blair, 3rd Baronet, in Malta. They had four sons and two daughters: The ornithologist Philip Lutley Sclater was married to a sister of Maria Dorothea. * James Thomas Spencer Elliot (1845‚Äì1892) * Walter Blair Elliot (1847‚Äì1869) * Caroline Elliot (1852‚Äìpost 1887) *Edward (1852‚Äì1920), who played football for Scotland in the unofficial international matches in 1871 and 1872. * Herman Elliot (1854‚Äì1895) * Dorothea Helen Elliot (died 1925)  Writings  Elliot was the author of : * Hindu Inscriptions being an outline of the Hindu Dynasties of S India from 4th to 12th Centuries deduced from Inscriptions collected in the Dekhan.

On April 8, 1946, the FCC reassigned the station to 92.9 MHz while allowing continued operation on 94.1 MHz. On July 26, 1946, the FCC granted a license renewal for operation on both 47.5 MHz and 92.9 MHz. The FCC on January 23, 1947 granted Westinghouse Radio Stations a construction permit to build new facilities for operation on 92.9 MHz, including installation of a new transmitter and antenna at a new site. The FCC granted a new license with the new facilities on June 26, 1952. =Experimental stereo= In the late 1950s, several systems to add stereo to FM radio were considered by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Included were systems from 14 competitors, such as Crosby, Halstead, EMI, Zenith Electronics Corporation and General Electric. The individual systems were evaluated for their strengths and weaknesses during field tests in Uniontown, Pennsylvania using KDKA-FM in Pittsburgh as the originating station. While credit is given for WEFM Chicago and WGFM Schenectady, New York on June 1, 1961 as the first stereo FM broadcasters, KDKA-FM was the first to broadcast in stereo, albeit on an experimental basis. During the 1970s, KDKA- FM was an automated station that played beautiful music during the day, and classical music at night. During morning and afternoon drive periods, the station joined its AM sister for rebroadcasting its intensive news blocks. =The Point= In October 1979, the station changed its call sign from KDKA- FM to WPNT (The Point), completely separating its programming from that of its AM sister. While still under the same ownership umbrella, Westinghouse also dropped the classical music for an all-beautiful music format with live announcers. It had a good debut, taking ratings away from the beautiful music station next to it on the dial, WJOI (93.7 FM, which later took the KDKA-FM call sign). The station then moved its studios from the KDKA home at One Gateway Center to 1051 Brinton Road, in suburban Pittsburgh community of Forest Hills. In 1984, WPNT was purchased by Long Island-based entrepreneur Saul Frischling in April 1984 for $3 million. Though Frischling himself is listed as the licensee, the station did business at that time as Legend Communications and then changed its name to Steel City Media in the late 1990s. Almost immediately after Saul Frischling purchased WPNT, it switched its format from easy listening to a totally live format of light adult contemporary, yet the station retained the WPNT calls and continued to bill itself as \\"The Point\\". WPNT's original lineup of on-air personalities at the time of start-up under the new format was Program Director Nat Humphries hosting mornings, John Gallagher for middays, Jon Summers for afternoons, Peter Morley for evenings, Jean Lam hosting overnights, and news anchors Jeff Long and Rick Charles. A year after the ownership change, KQV legend George Hart replaced Humphries as Program Director and morning show host. =Enter WLTJ= In May 1986, in an effort to better reflect its image as that of a light adult contemporary station, the station changed its call sign to WLTJ and rebranded as \\"Lite FM 92.9\\". (The WPNT callsign would resurface in the Pittsburgh market nearly three decades later when MyNetworkTV affiliate WPMY unexpectedly changed its callsign to WPNT.) Not long after the change, the station moved to a new, state-of-the-art broadcast facility at Seven Parkway Center in Green Tree borough. Music was a mixture of current and recurrent adult contemporary hits with a mix of standard hits from artists such as S√©rgio Mendes, Dionne Warwick, Barbra Streisand, and Andy Williams. Songs by those artists became a featured part of WLTJ's playlist and later became known as \\"Lite FM Encores\\". In addition, a new program known as \\"Heartlite\\" was created as a three-hour request and dedication show from 9 to midnight, hosted by Morley. The show was one of the first of its kind in the nation at the time. Weekend and fill-in announcer Gary Love would later assume responsibilities for the morning show from Hart, and Beth Bershok would assume Jean Lam's overnight shift by the end of the 1980s, in addition to doing traffic reports with Love on the morning show. The chemistry between Gary and Beth worked so well that the decision was made in the early 1990s to pair them together and bill them as equals. \\"Gary and Beth in the Morning\\" aired from 1991 until the station's format change in 2008. WLTJ became a dominant force among Pittsburgh Arbitron ratings, and among listeners as an office favorite. In 1989, WLTJ's position as a listen-at-work radio station was challenged when Pittsburgh's longtime easy-listening institution, WSHH, switched to a soft adult contemporary format and used its existing audience base to replicate WLTJ's ratings successes. WLTJ and WSHH often ran neck-and-neck in the ratings with similar formats, with one or the other occasionally shifting to the older or younger core of the 25-54 age demographic in order to keep up with ratings trends. That competition continues between the two stations today. Both WLTJ and WSHH share the distinction of being held by private owners, as opposed to publicly traded multiconglomerate broadcast operations. In 1993, after the FCC relaxed its ownership rules and allowed companies to own more than one FM station in the same market, Legend Communications purchased album rock formatted WRRK-FM (licensed to Braddock) from WHYW Associates. The station, which had been known as 97 Rock, reverted to its previous format of classic rock and its former moniker, Magic 97. The call sign, however, did not revert to WMYG, and the station became known as \\"Magic 97 WRRK\\". In 1999, both stations moved to a new, more spacious location on Smithfield Street in downtown Pittsburgh, with state-of-the-art, all-digital Equipment & Studios built by Chief Engineer, Paul Carroll from August to November of that year. Of the original WPNT adult contemporary weekday lineup, John Gallagher lasted until the entire staff was dismissed during the format adjustment made the weekend of March 23, 2008. George Hart died of complications from liver transplant surgery in 1993. Pat Bridges, who had joined the station in the early 80s in a part-time capacity, returned in 2004 to assume the role of host for \\"Heartlite\\". =The new \\"Q92.9\\"= After consistently disappointing ratings, the WLTJ identity disappeared the weekend of March 23, 2008 and the station was immediately rebranded as \\"Q92.9\\" (a somewhat ironic brand, as the station does not have, nor has it ever had, a Q in its call sign) with a different music mix. Station executives said they wanted to add more '90s music and felt the station needed an imaging overhaul to complete the transition. Most of the music from the 1970s was dropped, and more upbeat material from the 80s and 90s was added along with more current hits. The station began with no DJs. The station has a live air staff from 5:30 am to 12 am weekdays and 9 am to 7 pm on weekends. They also have weather, traffic, and entertainment reports, which were not initially run in the early days of the format. In November 2009, WLTJ shifted directions to Hot Adult Contemporary, with most of the musical mix focusing on more current product with some classics from the 1980s and 1990s getting less playtime. In addition to this change, the Q-Tags that were heard at the beginning of the Q's days, which stated the name and artist of every song at the end, were eliminated to create a faster paced, less interruptive musical selection, stemming from the opinions of some listeners. On July 5, 2016, WLTJ went jockless as it let the entire air staff go with the exception of afternoon host/PD Zack Szabo, presumably due to ratings, which has seen the station trailing its competitors since the shift to Adult Top 40. It also displayed a new slogan, billing themselves as \\"Your 10 In A Row Station.\\" They have since reinstated morning, mid-day, evening, and weekend air staff.https://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/107139/jim-krenn- exits-q92-9-pittsburgh-goes-jockless/ HD Radio WLTJ's HD Radio Channels on a SPARC Radio with PSD and EAS.

Psychographics have been applied to the study of personality, values, opinions, attitudes, interests, and lifestyles. Because this area of research focuses on activities, interests, and opinions, psychographic factors are sometimes abbreviated to 'AIO variables'. Psychographics are applied to the study of cognitive attributes such as attitudes, interests, opinions, and belief, as well as the study of overt behavior (e.g., activities). Psychographic studies of individuals or communities can be valuable in the fields of marketing, demographics, opinion research, prediction, and social research in general. Psychographic attributes can be contrasted with demographic variables (such as age and gender), behavioral variables (such as purchase data or usage rate), and organizational descriptors (sometimes called firmographic variables), such as industry, number of employees, and functional area. Psychographic methods gained prominence in the 2016 US presidential election and the opposing campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, with the latter using them extensively in microtargeting advertisements to narrow constituencies. Psychographic profiling When a relatively complete profile of a person or group's psychographic make-up is constructed, this is called a \\"psychographic profile\\". Psychographic profiles are used in market segmentation as well as in advertising. Some categories of psychographic factors used in market segmentation include: * activity, interest, opinion (AIOs) * attitudes *values * behavior Psychographic can also be seen as an equivalent of the concept of \\"culture\\" when it is used for segmentation at a national level. Comparison to demographics Psychographics is often confused with demographics, where historical generations may be defined both by demographics, such as the years in which a particular generation is born or even the fertility rates of that generation's parents, but also by psychographic variables like attitudes, personality formation, and cultural touchstones. For example, the traditional approaches to defining the Baby Boom Generation or Generation X or Millennials have relied on both demographic variables (classifying individuals based on birth years) and psychographic variables (such as beliefs, attitudes, values and behaviors). Infusionsoft published an article arguing that customer psychographic segmentation is more useful than demographic information.

Each cycle was accompanied by a ceremony. In order to rectify the Cherokee calendar with that of the Julian calendar, these cycles were reduced to 12. The seasonal round of ceremonies was integral to Cherokee society. It was considered an important spiritual element for social cohesion and a way to bring all the Cherokee clans together. The Cherokee, like many other Native tribes, used a turtle‚Äôs back pattern of scales to determine their calendar cycle. The scales around the edge added up to 28, the same number of days as in a lunar cycle, while the center contained 13 larger scales, representing the 13 moon cycles of a year. Turtle shell calendar Thirteen seasonal moon ceremonies Cherokee priests, known as ·é†·èÇ·é´·èî·èÇ or A-ni-ku-ta-ni, defined the 13 ceremonies as listed below.

The centre's chief purpose is to fill the gap in an industry that is sorely lacking in skills on the continent. It aims to help with the development of skills, knowledge and practices for commercially effective, environmentally aware and socially responsible development and management of the real estate industry in Africa. MBAid MBAid is a learning initiative between NGOs and Henley Business School Africa. The rationale behind its establishment is that as funding has begun to dry up, NGOs have had to rely increasingly on their ability to fund themselves to survive. One of the principal ideas behind MBAid is to give the NGO a fresh perspective, by bringing in a group of people (students) who are unattached to the outcomes of the NGO. They bring in different insights and perspectives and engage with NGOs in such a way that there is a transfer of skills so that, ultimately, the NGO can become self-sustaining. Accreditation Henley is the only international business school in Africa accredited by all three major international accreditation bodies: the European Foundation for Management Development which awards the European Quality Improvement System (Equis), the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) and the Association of MBAs (AMBA). It is also the only international business school accredited by the South African Council on Higher Education (CHE), which is responsible for quality assurance and promotion through the Higher Education Quality Committee (HEQC).

Many of the refugees were Hutu ethnics fleeing the predominantly Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), which had gained control of the country at the end of the genocide. However, the humanitarian relief effort was vastly compromised by the presence among the refugees of many of the Interahamwe and government officials who carried out the genocide, who used the refugee camps as bases to launch attacks against the new government led by Paul Kagame. The camps in Zaire became particularly politicized and militarized. The knowledge that humanitarian aid was being diverted to further the aims of the genocidaires led many humanitarian organizations to withdraw their assistance. The conflict escalated until the start of the First Congo War in 1996, when RPF-supported rebels invaded Zaire and sought to repatriate the refugees.  Background  The categories Hutu and Tutsi have an origin in pre-colonial Rwanda. However, with the arrival of the Germans in about 1900, and particularly after the arrival of the Belgians in 1920, the categories began to \\"rigidify\\" and become thought of as ethnic. The modern history of Rwanda has in many ways been one of tension between the majority Hutu and minority Tutsi \\"ethnic\\" groups. While there has been much scholarship about the emergence of these separate ethnic identities, particularly through the colonial governance structures, before and after independence in 1961, people within Rwanda acted within the parameters of the Tutsi-Hutu division. Regardless of the historical validity of the division, Rwandans in the late 20th century acted as if they were real. Belgium began to withdraw from Rwanda in 1959, and in 1961 a Hutu-dominated government was established. This replaced the colonial government of Belgium, which had ruled through a favored Tutsi royal family. One of the consequences of the Hutu victory was sporadic attacks against Tutsis that led to over 300,000 Tutsis fleeing the country over the next several years. Anti-Hutu attacks in neighboring Burundi by the Tutsi-led government there led a renewal in attacks against Tutsis in Rwanda in 1973, resulting in even more refugees, many seeking asylum in Uganda. The land formerly owned by these thousands of refugees was subsequently claimed by others, creating another politically charged situation. By the 1980s, the Rwandan government of Juv√©nal Habyarimana claimed that the country could not accommodate the return of all refugees without the help of international community because Rwanda was said to be among most densely populated countries on the African continent. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Rwandan exiles formed political and military alliances, particularly in Uganda. The leader of one of these was Paul Kagame, whose family had fled to Uganda during the violence of 1959. In 1985, Kagame helped form the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), an armed group aligned with the National Resistance Army (NRA), a Ugandan rebel group led by Yoweri Museveni. Kagame became the head of NRA military intelligence and a close ally of Museveni. In 1986, the NRA rebellion succeeded and Museveni became President of Uganda. Museveni then supported a failed RPF invasion of Rwanda in 1990, as both a reward to an ally and in the hopes that the large Rwandan refugee population in Uganda would return home. The invasion, and the subsequent occupation of parts of the northern prefectures of Byumba, Umutara and Ruhengeri, internally displaced many Hutus and heightened ethnic tensions. The skulls of victims of the genocide The 1993 Arusha Accords attempted to offer a diplomatic solution to both the RPA threat and the internal tensions, but it was not implemented. Ethnic tensions became even greater following the murder of Burundian President Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu, in October 1993, an event that sparked the Burundian Civil War in which large numbers of both Hutus and Tutsis were killed. Hutu militants, known as Interahamwe, and elements in the government in Rwanda began to plan a genocide to rid the country of the Tutsis. The assassinations of Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira on 6 April 1994 became the pretext for the start of the Rwandan Genocide, which resulted in the deaths of several hundred thousand people, mostly Tutsi, over the next three months. Most murders were carried out by, with the cooperation of, or in the absence of protest by Hutus who lived in the same communities as their victims.  The RPF advance and Hutu exodus  Rwanda The border crossing at Rusumo Falls was the site of the largest, quickest refugee exodus ever seen. Tanzania is on the left, Rwanda on the right. At the beginning of the genocide in April 1994, the Rwandan Patriotic Front began an offensive from territory in northern Rwanda that it had captured in previous fighting and made rapid progress. Hutus fled the advancing RPF forces, with French historian G√©rard Prunier asserting, \\"Most of the Hutu who had stayed in the country were there because they had not managed to run away in time.\\"Prunier 2009, pp. 4, 5, 23, 24‚Äì25, 26, 28 In the midst of the chaos of post-genocide Rwanda, over 700,000 Tutsi refugees, some of whom had been in Uganda since 1959, began their return. Contrary to refugee flows in other wars, the Rwandan exodus was not large numbers of individuals seeking safety, but a large-scale, centrally directed initiative. The refugees settled in massive camps almost directly on the Rwandan border, organized by their former leaders in Rwanda. Jo√´l Boutroue, a senior UNHCR staff member in the refugee camps, wrote, \\"Discussions with refugee leaders...showed that exile was the continuation of war by other means.\\" The result was dramatic. An estimated 500,000 Rwandans fled east into Tanzania in the month of April. On 28--29 April, 250,000 people crossed the bridge at Rusumo Falls into Ngara, Tanzania in 24 hours in what the UNHCR agency called \\"the largest and fastest refugee exodus in modern times\\". The apparent organization of this Rusumo evacuation is seen as evidence that the collapsing government was behind the large refugee outflows. By May 1994, a further 200,000 people from the provinces of Butare, Kibungo and Kigali-Rural had fled south into Burundi. As the RPF captured the capital of Kigali, the military of France set up a safe zone in southwest Rwanda in June 1994 in what was dubbed \\"Op√©ration Turquoise\\". It was ostensibly done to stop the genocide, but the French/European forces prohibited the entry of RPF forces that were already stopping the genocide and the Hutus who fled there included militants and members of the ousted government, as well as Hutu civilians. The French soon ended their intervention, leading to the flight of 300,000 people from the Zone Turquoise west towards the Zairean town of Bukavu in July and August, while a further 300,000 remained in internally displaced person camps. On 18 July 1994, RPF forces captured the northwestern town of Gisenyi and declared a new government with Pasteur Bizimungu as president and Kagame in the newly created position of vice-president. Gisenyi was the center of the provisional government and its fall caused over 800,000 Rwandans to cross into Goma, Zaire, over four days in late July. This outflow was also highly organized, with administrative structures simply transferred across the border. By the end of August, UNHCR estimated that there were 2.1 million Rwandan refugees in neighboring countries located in 35 camps. Around Goma, the capital of North Kivu in Zaire, five huge camps‚ÄîKatale, Kahindo, Mugunga, Lac Vert and Sake‚Äîheld at least 850,000 people.Prunier 2009, pp. 24‚Äì25 To the south, around Bukavu and Uvira, thirty camps held about 650,000 people. A further 270,000 refugees were located in nine camps in Burundi, and another 570,000 in eight camps in Tanzania. The new population around Goma included 30,000 to 40,000 soldiers of the former Armed Forces of Rwanda (), fully armed with an intact officer corps and transport unit, as well as almost all of the politicians. The only other camp complex to host significant numbers of leaders of the former government was the large Benaco camp in Tanzania, which held a small number of the exiled military and political leadership. The exiles chose to base themselves mainly in Zaire because of the support given by President Mobutu Sese Seko. The five camps around Goma, among others, would eventually take on a certain permanence, eventually containing 2,323 bars, 450 restaurants, 589 shops, 62 hairdressers, 51 pharmacies, 30 tailors, 25 butchers, five ironsmiths and mechanics, four photo studios, three movie theaters, two hotels and one slaughterhouse. About 140,000 refugees returned, mostly on their own, in the first three months after the original exodus. The UNHCR was forced to halt its efforts to repatriate refugees after both their staff and the refugees were threatened by Interahamwe under the orders of the exiled leadership. However, by September 1994 rumors of violence by the RPF within Rwanda, combined with tightened control by the Hutu leadership of the camps, has drastically reduced the rate of return and eventually stopped it altogether by early 1995.For a contemporary analysis of the situation, see Rwanda and Burundi: The return home: rumours and realities, Amnesty International, 20 February 1996, p. 14-15  Emergency relief  Bodies of Rwandan refugees wrapped in blankets and straw mats along a road, October 1994 In the first week of July, deaths among the refugee community were occurring at a rate of 600 per week, and two weeks later had reached 2000 per week as the refugee population increased and the health situation worsened. Mortality rates reached a height during a 24-hour period in late July when the death toll near Goma from cholera, diarrhea and other diseases was 7000. Over 50,000 people died, mainly from a cholera epidemic that swept through the camps. The refugees near Goma were located at Mugunga on a plain of volcanic rock, which was so hard that the French troops and aid workers were unable to dig graves for the bodies that began to line roads. The situation led the UN Representative to Rwanda Shahryar Khan to call the camps a \\"revision of hell\\". The international media coverage of the plight of the refugees eventually led U.S. President Bill Clinton to call it the \\"world‚Äôs worst humanitarian crisis in a generation\\" and large amounts of relief was mobilized. Attention quickly focused on the refugees around Goma. Over 200 aid organizations rushed into Goma to start an emergency relief operation comparable to that seen in the Yugoslav wars. Until December, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) received over $1 million monthly. The resources dedicated to the refugees led to a rapid drop in the mortality rate in late 1994. The American military formed an emergency logistical operation, based out of Entebbe International Airport in Uganda, to ferry supplies and relief personnel to the crisis regions. While several humanitarian organizations expressed concern about mixing the military in humanitarian operations, it quickly became clear that only the military could create large centralized logistical support with the speed and scale needed to alleviate a massive humanitarian emergency. The humanitarian situation was not as acute in the other nations bordering Rwanda, though still very challenging. Tanzania had a number of refugee camps that had been created for the civilians fleeing the onset of the Burundian Civil War. Most of these Burundians had returned to their home country by 1994 so Tanzania had the infrastructure to handle the initial influx of Rwandan refugees. However, facilities there were also eventually overwhelmed by the sheer number of people fleeing across the border, requiring emergency humanitarian intervention. = Interventions by particular nations = Convoy of American military vehicles bring fresh water from Goma to Rwandan refugees located at Camp Kimbumba, Zaire in August 1994 The UN, in the absence of any serious military aid from the US, was forced to open its communication pathways wider than before and urge other countries to join the efforts. The US agreed to support these efforts with finance and some equipment. Early in the relief process, US relief planes began to drop large food packages from the air in hopes of alleviating the suffering in the camps below. Instead, the opposite occurred, as people were slaughtered by mobs trying to reach the precious food. Due to the perils of such chaos in the refugee camps, the US refused to bring its aid closer to the ground, and, as time went by, dysentery and cholera began to spread rapidly through the crowded refugee camps, ultimately killing tens of thousands. Soon, the problem was exacerbated as rain began to fall and many people contracted septic meningitis. By then, France had established a field hospital at the area of Lake Kivu in an attempt to help the large numbers of refugees. Some of these refugees were Interahamwe leaders and members of the government who fled the country fearing retaliation from the RPF. To aid the ground forces, Israel conducted the largest medical mission in its history, and, although their supplies were not as abundant as those of the other forces, their all-volunteer force of military surgeons was composed both of specialists and sub-specialists, including well-known surgeons. The two units established a unique and constructive method of operation which relied on France's abundant medical supplies and Israel's medical expertise. The Netherlands had sent a small contingent of mostly medics and nurses, which was beneficial for rehabilitation efforts and ambulatory care after patients left the French-Israeli medical quarters. CARE Deutschland supplied ambulances, and Merlin of Ireland supplied trucks and heavy equipment to distribute food and supplies to the refugee camps. Working together, these two units are credited with curbing the death toll in the area of Lake Kivu, near Goma, Zaire. The country of Germany was the sixth largest donor to the intervention, Ireland was 16th.  Militarization of refugee camps  The Zaire-Rwanda border region The first goal of the political leadership was to gain control of the food supply. This was accomplished by a system of \\"elected popular leaders\\", who acted as a front for the real leaders and were able to secure control of the humanitarian aid. The leadership could punish their enemies by withholding aid, reward their supporters by giving it and even make money either by reporting more refugees than actually existed and selling the surplus or by forcing the refugees to pay a food tax. The political elite and ex-FAR soldiers were given preferential treatment.Prunier 2009, p. 25 This led, for example, to the otherwise curious finding of one humanitarian aid study that 40% of refugees in Kibumba camp ate less than 2,000 kcal per person, while 13% received over 10,000 kcal per person.Footnote 97, in Prunier 2009, p. 375 Refugees who disagreed with the structure, who tried to return to Rwanda or were too frank with aid workers in discussing the situation were subject to intimidation and murder.Prunier 2009, pp. 25‚Äì26 As the initial acute humanitarian crisis was stabilized, aid workers and others began to raise concerns about the presence of armed elements in the camps. Soldiers of the former and the Interahamwe militia created armed outposts on the outskirts of the refugee camps, while the camps themselves came under the control of officials of the former government. Humanitarian workers reported that former government officials, especially near Goma, were passing out large amount of money to the militia to control the refugees on their behalf. Those refugees who tried to protest were either beaten into submission or killed. The relief operation began to be accused of \\"feeding the killers\\", causing a crisis of conscience among the agencies, who began to leave what some have called \\"the messiest humanitarian quagmire ever\\". The first to leave was M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res, who stated that \\"this humanitarian operation was a total ethical disaster\\" as it rewarded those responsible for the genocide rather than punishing them. The International Rescue Committee, a long- standing implementing partner of the UNHCR, then left stating that \\"humanitarianism has become a resource and people are manipulating it as never before. Sometimes we just shouldn‚Äôt show up for a disaster.\\" These two organizations were joined by Oxfam, Save the Children and CARE, completing the departure of the largest and most professional humanitarian aid organizations upon which UNHCR relied heavily. A secondary reason given by some of these organizations is that they hoped that this dramatic action would prompt the international community to disarm the camps. Despite repeated calls by the UN for international intervention to separate the armed elements from the civilians in need of assistance, there was little response. Of over 40 countries that UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros Ghali approached to provide peacekeepers, only one replied affirmatively. The UN eventually resorted to hiring Zairean soldiers to provide a minimum level of security, a situation that everyone realized was far from ideal. In light of their abandonment by its trusted partners and the insecurity, High Commissioner Sadako Ogata was asked why UNHCR did not simply leave as well. She replied: > There were also innocent refugees in the camps; more than half were women > and children. Should we have said: you are related to murderers, so you are > guilty, too? My mandate ‚Äî unlike those of private aid agencies ‚Äî obliges me > to help. Both for those organizations that left and that stayed, the post-Rwandan Genocide refugee crisis became a watershed event that prompted an extensive reevaluation of their mandates and procedures, and the relative ethical cases for abandonment and continuing aid were hotly debated. At the same time, France and the World Bank withheld development aid from the new government of Rwanda until the refugees were repatriated, prompting accusations that the donors were simply repeating the cycle of poverty that had led Rwanda into crisis originally.  The forgotten years  Despite the increasingly troublesome situation, the attention of the world turned elsewhere after the immediate crisis had ended. Funding levels for relief fell from the beginning of 1995. Hampered by lack of international interest and decreasing funds, the UN went from discussing methods of separating fighters from civilians or moving the camps farther from the border with Rwanda to increasingly desperate ideas, such as cutting off relief to the camps or a limited forced repatriation in clear violation of refugee law. The Hutu militants in the camps were very aware that the camps provided both protection and resources for their military activities. They thus had an interest in keeping the camps where they were, in effect making the refugees semi-hostages. Rumors of Tutsi retributions and an impending second genocide also convinced many Hutu refugees that they should not return. The obvious candidate to impose order was the Zairean government of dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. However, Zaire was a large and weak state, which did not have firm control of the eastern regions that were on the opposite side of the country from the capital. It has also been noted that Uganda and Zaire had unfriendly relations. Mobutu would not have been pleased by the emergence of a Rwandan government that was allied with Uganda and may have hoped that the Hutu militants could rid him of the new government of Paul Kagame. Documents belonging to Hutu fighters show that Mobutu allowed the militants to ship large amounts of arms into the country. The only other option with international credibility was a multilateral intervention led by the UN, but it quickly became clear that few nations were interested in what seemed certain to be a difficult and bloody operation in a remote African region. As deadlock was reached in international political and military efforts to resolve the crisis, the tempo of attacks based out of the camps, mainly in Zaire, across the border into Rwanda increased. The RPF became increasingly vocal in its condemnation of UNHCR, which it saw as aiding its enemies, and demands that the attacks be stopped. Nevertheless, no action was taken. The fact that the refugee crisis could not continue indefinitely was emphasized in January 1996 when Burundi closed the two camps within its borders and told the refugees that they should return to Rwanda. The refugees instead began to trickle across into Tanzania until Tanzania closed its Burundian border in April after its refugee burden reached 550,000. Burundi, then in the midst of a civil war, had been stressed by the demands of the refugees but was also influenced by a desire not to antagonize the new government of its neighbor to the north.  Outbreak of war  Refugee camp near Sake, DRC, November 1996 The crisis became increasingly unstable as it continued into 1996. The Hutu militants in the camps, now well organized, began to expand their activities from raids into Rwanda to attacks on the Banyamulenge ethnic group in eastern Zaire. The Banyamulenge were ethnic kinspeople to the Tutsi, having migrated from Rwanda over a century earlier. Rwanda began to secretly ship weapons across the border to arm the Banyamulenge in their fight against the exiled Rwandan Hutus, resulting in a low level conflict in the Zairean provinces of North and South Kivu. While details are unclear, sometime during this period Rwanda, with the support of Uganda, began to plan the creation of a rebellion led by Laurent Kabila. In October 1996, a Zairean government official based in Bukavu declared that the Banyamulenge would be forced to leave the country, apparently as an attempt to end the conflict between them and the Hutu militants. This led to an uprising of the Banyamulenge in the Kivus, who were now well-armed by the RPF, and an exchange of mortar fire between the armies of Zaire and Rwanda across Lake Kivu. With a speed that many observers found suspect, Kabila found himself head of the well-supplied rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Zaire (AFDL), which included the Banyamulenge militias. This new conflict came to be known as the First Congo War. At the time, Rwanda officially denied any military connection to the new rebel group, although it openly expressed support for its goal of overthrowing Mobutu. The first objective of the AFDL was the clearing of the string of rebel camps along the Rwandan border, setting the stage for what has been called one of the most bizarre and macabre situations of modern times. As the AFDL captured a series of Kivutian border towns in November 1996, the Hutu militants herded the refugees into Mugungu, creating a teeming mass of around half a million people who were prohibited from returning across the border by Hutu forces arrayed facing the border. The Hutu resistance was broken after the RPF swung southwest and flanked the Hutu force. Hundreds of thousands of refugees fled back into Rwanda as the aid organizations and foreign countries stood impotent to affect the course of events. Tens of thousands of refugees also moved further into Zaire. Some of these were officials and soldiers associated with the genocide and their families, but most were simply swept along in the giant waves of people. The AFDL and Rwandan RPF forces pursued the militants westward and tens of thousands of refugees died of violence, exposure to the elements, and starvation in the jungles of eastern Zaire. In December 1996, the government of Tanzania announced that the 550,000 Rwandan refugees it was hosting must return and forcibly emptied the camps over the next few months. By the beginning of 1997, the vast majority of refugees who had fled in the aftermath of the Rwandan Genocide has returned. The refugee crisis precipitated by an internal genocide had been ended by a new war.  Effects  The AFDL continued its offensive until it reached Kinshasa and overthrew Mobutu in 1997. Mobutu fled Zaire and soon died in exile four months later. Afterwards, Kabila named himself the new president and changed the name of the country to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. However, the relationship between Kabila and his Rwandan and Ugandan backers turned sour. An attempt by Rwanda and Uganda to overthrow Kabila in 1998 grew into the Second Congo War, the world's deadliest conflict since World War II. While peace was officially declared in 2003, ethnically inspired violence continues to afflict the Kivus. Rwanda continues to struggle with the aftermath of genocide and large-scale forced migration. The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) and community gacaca courts exist to punish those who planned and carried out the genocide, but the scale of violence forced the Rwandan people into an occasionally uneasy coexistence. The Rwandan government has been generally credited with encouraging economic development and national reconciliation, though it has also been criticized for oppression of its critics. The crisis had a massive impact on the ecology of the region. The forests of Virunga National Park, home to the endangered mountain gorilla, were badly damaged by the demands for firewood and charcoal made by the refugees. Two years after the arrival of the refugees 105 km2 of the park's forest had been affected, of which 63 km2 had been razed.Henquin and Blondel, 1997 The outside world, at the time focused on the wars of the former Yugoslavia, turned its attention away from the happenings of central Africa. The exception was the international humanitarian aid community and the United Nations, for whom the Great Lakes crisis was an agonizing dilemma that has been the topic of extensive analysis and ethical arguments. As a result, UNHCR reworked its procedures to try to ensure greater international commitment in its interventions.  References  Further reading  * * Des Forges, Alison (1999).

Two different versions of the character appear in two separate (but related) continuities, Squadron Supreme and Supreme Power. Both bear the real name of Dr. Emil Burbank, though the former character has the middle name of \\"Zebediah\\". Master Menace is an analogue of Lex Luthor with elements of Doctor Doom. This Master Menace is a supergenius inventor and is gifted in numerous fields of physical science. He usually wears a suit of powered armor with an arsenal of built-in weapons, which enables him to fight superhumans on a more equal basis (especially his nemesis, Hyperion).  Publication history  Master Menace first appeared in Thor (vol. 1) #280 (February 1979), and was created by Roy Thomas and Wayne Boring. Fictional character biographySquadron Supreme= Originally, Hyperion encountered Dr. Emil Burbank (a.k.a. Master Menace) on Earth-712 (sometimes called \\"Earth-S\\"). In his first appearance, he battles Hyperion while the hero was filming a movie directed by Burbank's brother, L.L. Burbank. On this occasion, Burbank works with the evil Hyperion of the mainstream Marvel Universe Earth-616, and imprisons the visiting Thor. Burbank is taken captive but later found himself in an interdimensional vacuum as he attempted to escape confinement. When the Squadron are rebuilding America after the devastation caused by the Overmind, Master Menace concentrated his efforts on conquering the Middle East. He gave shelter to three supervillains: Remnant, Pinball, and the Mink, sending them to Earth-616. He later supplied the Redeemers with a way to reverse the brainwashing technology of the Squadron. In Squadron Supreme: Death of a Universe, Emil Burbank ages fifteen years after going into the 41st century with Scarlet Centurion to build a device to stop the Nth Man. In Squadron Supreme: New World Order, Emil Burbank is a wheelchair-bound old man, at the mercy of large, multi-national corporations, and using the Squadron's own Utopia technologies. =Supreme Power= Emil Burbank is a man with many aliases and possibly the greatest intellect on the planet. He has doctoral degrees in biology, chemistry, metallurgy, psychology, economics and literature from three different universities. As a child, he sexually abused his older sister by drugging her unconscious with chemical compounds, eventually leaving her in a permanent catatonic state. At 18, his parents died in a car accident, which he arranged and boasts about even while trying to say it was an accident. Emil is noted for malicious and homicidal retribution against those he feels have wronged him. A school bully and a professor who accused him of cheating were both caught in fires started by Emil. After Emil agrees to work for the government, General Alexander sends Emil, Nuke, Arcanna, and Shape to apprehend or destroy Hyperion. While fighting Hyperion, Arcanna's quantum powers, Nuke's radioactive blast, and Hyperion's flash vision combine to create an effect that sends them all to an alternate reality, where Hyperion and most of the other heroes wage war against Earth's governments, to \\"save\\" humanity. However, the \\"alternate\\" reality is actually their reality, only years in the future. Emil and Hyperion are the only two members of the Squadron aware of this information after the five are returned to the correct time stream.Supreme Power: Hyperion #1 - 5 (2005 - 2006) Emil was to be on the covert operations team after Hyperion's return to America, but after Hyperion informs a reporter of the project and gives him a list of the super-humans working for the government, the U.S. President gives a press conference and announces the formation of Squadron Supreme.

It lies between the borders of Trentino and Veneto. Geography The mountain is located about north-northwest of Venice, from which it can be seen on a clear day. It consists of a ridge running west to east. Towards the south it breaks suddenly into sheer cliffs, forming a rock face several kilometres long. On the north side there is a comparatively flat glacier, the only large glacier in the Dolomites (the Marmolada Glacier, Ghiacciaio della Marmolada). The ridge is composed of several summits, decreasing in altitude from west to east: Punta Penia , Punta Rocca , Punta Ombretta , Monte Serauta , and Pizzo Serauta . An aerial tramway goes to the top of Punta Rocca. During the ski season the Marmolada's main ski run is opened for skiers and snowboarders alike, making it possible to ski down into the valley. History Paul Grohmann made the first ascent in 1864, along the north route. The south face was climbed for the first time in 1901 by Beatrice Tomasson, Michele Bettega and Bartolo Zagonel. Until the end of World War I the border between Austria- Hungary and Italy ran over Marmolada, so it formed part of the front line during that conflict. Austro-Hungarian soldiers were quartered in deep tunnels bored into the northern face's glacier, and Italian soldiers were quartered on the south face's rocky precipices. It was also the site of fierce mine warfare on the Italian Front. As glaciers retreat, soldiers' remains and belongings are occasionally discovered.

It is a type of sales promotion that marketers use primarily as incentives or supplements to product sales. The mail-in rebate (MIR) is the most common. A MIR entitles the buyer to mail in a coupon, receipt, and barcode in order to receive a check for a particular amount, depending on the particular product, time, and often place of purchase. Rebates are offered by either the retailer or the manufacturer of the chosen product. Large stores often work in conjunction with manufacturers, usually requiring two or even three separate rebates for each item. Manufacturer rebates are sometimes valid only at a single store. Rebate forms and special receipts are sometimes printed by the cash register at time of purchase on a separate receipt or available online for download. In some cases, the rebate may be available immediately, in which case it is referred to as an instant rebate. Some rebate programs offer several payout options to consumers, including a paper check, a prepaid card that can be spent immediately without a trip to the bank, or even PayPal payout. Uses Rebates are heavily used for advertising sales in retail stores. For example, an item might be advertised as \\"$39 after rebate\\" with the item costing $79 out-the-door with a $40 rebate that the customer would need to redeem. The turnaround time is generally four to eight weeks, though some rebates note a period of eight to twelve weeks. In the UK, rebates are less common, with manufacturers and retailers preferring to give discounts at the point of sale rather than requiring mail-in or coupons. However, rebates are sometimes given in the form of \\"cashback offers\\" for mobile phone contracts or other high value retail items sold alongside a credit agreement. Rebate clearinghouses Most rebates are handled under contract by rebate clearinghouses that specialize in processing rebates and contest applications. Types of rebatesInstant rebate= An instant rebate, or sometimes instant savings, is a marketing strategy or gimmick in which a product is either advertised at a specific price, or at a discounted price, where the discount is applied at the time of purchase. For example, the store may advertise a widget for $9.99, but with a $5 instant rebate, the price is $4.99. Or the product may be advertised as $4.99 with a $5 instant rebate. Instant rebates are different from a \\"standard\\" rebate. Under normal circumstances, a rebate is given to a customer who mails in a coupon along with proof of purchase, and is mailed a check by the manufacturer or the rebate processor. In the case of an instant rebate, the rebate is provided immediately, at the instant of purchase. We can see instant rebate as a discount on a product. In accounting strategy the actual invoice will be less by the amount of the instant rebate that is given to the customer. Then: invoice cost = the product cost - instant rebate amount. Regulations and laws In the United States, Connecticut state regulations section 42-110b-19(e) require retailers who advertise the net price of an item after rebate to pay consumers the amount of that rebate at time of purchase. Rhode Island has similar legislation (Gen. Laws 6-13.1-1). Otherwise, the after- rebate price cannot be advertised as the final price to be paid by the consumer. For example, retailers in Connecticut can advertise only \\"$40 with a $40 rebate,\\" not \\"Free After Rebate,\\" unless they give the rebate at the time of purchase. Rationale Rebates have become very popular in retail sales within the United States. Retailers and manufacturers have many reasons to offer them: * The information given in the rebate form, such as name, address, method of payment, can be used for data mining studies of consumer behavior. * The information can be used as evidence of a pre-existing business relationship for marketing purposes, such as do not call lists. * Customers tend to notice price increases and react negatively. Rebates offer retailers the benefit of giving customers a temporary discount on an item, to stimulate sales, while allowing it to maintain its current price point. This method avoids the negative backlash that could be perceived with a price being lowered and then raised later.R. Avila and T. Avila Rebates: An ethical issue? Ball State University * Rebates also allow companies to \\"price protect\\" certain product lines by being selective in which models or brands to be discounted. This allows retailers and manufacturers to move some product at lower cost while maintaining prices of successful models. A straight price reduction on some models would have a domino effect on all products in a line. * During the turnaround time, the company can earn interest on the money. * If the turnaround time crosses into the next fiscal year or quarter, a rebate offer can inflate sales in the current period, and not have to be accounted for until the next period and then it could be attributed as a cost reducing sales or expense for the next period, giving companies an accounting advantage with their Wall Street projections. * Not all buyers will meet the criteria to receive the rebate. Companies often require the original UPC barcode, receipt, and additional information, which a buyer may forget to include when redeeming the rebate. Companies almost always add other caveats to the rebate as well, such as the redemption having to be postmarked by a certain date. Another tactic that might be used is to disguise the rebate mail to look like junk mail, so that the customer may overlook it. It works in the company's favor if buyers do not act quickly to redeem. However, a University of Florida study notes that shorter redemption periods actually increase the redemption rate in the consumer's favor because it gives them less time for procrastination to set in. * New companies that want to make a break into a market can offer substantial rebate savings on their new product as a means of capturing a customer's attention. Zeus Kerravala, vice president at the Yankee Group, has said, \\"For companies that haven't been in a particular market, the rebate that essentially refunds the customer's money is a great way to get people to pay attention to them. This is especially true in consumer electronics, where brand name does matter. It's a good way to get customers to take a chance on a new brand.\\" =Benefits and costs for consumers= Rebates may offer customers lower pricing. Deal hunter sites frequently tout the benefits of rebates in making technology affordable: \\"Rebates are the meat and potatoes of the ultimate tech deal, no matter what you are buying‚Ä¶ They are paying you money to buy their stuff. All you have to do is take it.\\" According to 2011 research, 47% of consumers submitted a rebate in the past 12 months, whereas similar research conducted in 2009 showed that only 37 percent of consumers had submitted a rebate in the prior year. Industry advisers claim that if mail-in rebates go away, they will not be replaced by \\"instant rebates\\" of the same value amount because of the loss of the tangible benefits listed above (fiscal accounting, price protection, etc.) Steve Baker, vice president of industry analysis for NPD Group, comments that \\"It's a case of be careful of what you ask for. You may see some great deals go away.\\"Melinda Fulmer Don't get ripped off by a rebate 'deal' MSN Money Rebates take a certain amount of time and effort from the consumer ‚Äì figuring out the rules, filling out the forms, preparing and dropping off the mailing, cashing in the check, keeping track of the paperwork while this is being done. Thus, a rebate can be thought of as being paid to do this paperwork and provide one's personal data to the company. Chances of rebate mailing being lost or failing some criteria may further reduce the expected return on this effort. Consumers who are aware of this, and who value their time, effort, and opportunity costs above the value of the rebate may choose to intentionally ignore a non-instant rebate that requires such procedures and assume the out-the-door price when considering the purchase. On the other hand, if the consumer does not see it this way, if the consumer's income and budget are extremely limited or non-existent, or if the consumer is more concerned with the price than his or her time for any reason, the rebate may be seen as a good deal. Another potential disadvantage to receiving a rebate is that the rebate does not refund any of the sales tax charged at the time of purchase. Thus the consumer will pay more in tax than if the price had simply been lowered at the time of purchase. Redemption rate inconsistencies It is difficult to get an account of redemption rates from most rebate companies, partly due to a reluctance on the part of rebate fulfillment houses to release confidential business information. Among different sources, radically different numbers on both ends of the spectrum can be cited. Part of the reason is that most \\"redemption rates\\" do not distinguish whether they are calculated as part of total sales or incremental sales. * PMA, a marketing firm, estimated that in 2005, $486.5 million worth of rebates were redeemed. The redemption rates averaged 21.1% when calculated as a percentage of total sales, and 67.6% when calculated as a percentage of incremental sales. PMA notes, \\"These statistics reveal that redemption rates calculated as a percentage of total sales can be misleading when diluted by non-incremental sales, consequently making redemption rates appear lower than they truly are.\\"Promotion Marketing Association, Inc PMA Mail-in Rebate Benchmarking Study, 2005 May 1st, 2005 * Not all buyers remember to mail the coupons, a phenomenon known in the industry as breakage, or the shoebox effect. Though it can be used interchangeably with breakage,CBC News Marketing rebates: The science of 'slippage' Jan. 2nd, 2005 slippage is the phenomenon when a consumer has his or her rebate fulfilled, but he or she loses or forgets to cash the check. Some rebate companies could tout a higher \\"redemption rate\\" including the breakage, while not calculating the potential slippage of uncashed checks. =Some redemption estimates= * In November 2005, BusinessWeek estimated a return rate of 60 percent. Some estimates have been as low as 2%. For example, nearly half of the 100,000 new TiVo subscribers in 2005 did not redeem their $100 rebates, allowing the company to keep $5,000,000 in additional profit.Brian Grow The Great Rebate Runaround Business Week Online Nov. 23rd 2005 * PC Data in the Reston, VA estimates between \\"10 and 30 percent\\".Henry Norr The How And Why Of Rebates Dec. 18th, 2005 * PlusNetMarketing in Wilmington, DE quotes 80%.James E. Gaskin Beating the rebate runaround, Part 4 Network World March 1st, 2004 * A representative in 2005 from The Marco Corporation stated, \\"In some cases, we do have redemption programs that go as high as forty to fifty per cent, but generally it‚Äôs about one to five per cent\\". In the same article, John Challinor, advertising manager for Sony Canada remarks, \\"The industry average is less than ten percent.... and it can be as low as one percent.\\" * NPD Group, a marketing firm, estimates 50% to 70%. General complaints Typical UPC barcode required for rebate submission At some big box stores, personal computers are regularly sold with sizable rebates attached, making the advertised price more attractive to buyers. Hardware manufacturers have come under fire, also. Dell, for one, has been the subject of rebate complaints involving misprinted receipts, potentially confusing expiration dates, and service representatives who are slow to react. Rebate issues began to clog Dell's customer service forums, leading the company to shut down that portion of the website.Carla Thorton Dell Closes Longtime Customer Message Boards PC World July 14th, 2005 CompUSA used rebates regularly until it started closing its remaining stores in December 2007. Cell phone service companies, including major players like T-Mobile, as well as third-party retailers like Radio Shack, Wirefly and others have received growing attention due to complex rebate redemption rules. Both carriers and retailers make customers submit rebate claims during a 30-day window, often 6 months after cell phone activation.Bob Sullivan CONSUMERS IRKED BY CELL PHONE REBATES ON HOLD MSNBC Some authorized dealers have responded by trying to make rebate requirements more transparent, explaining that the carrier will withdraw payment from them if a customer quits service before the end of the contract. In 2009, Florida State Attorney General Bill McCollum filed suit against TigerDirect, OnRebate, and TigerDirect's parent company Systemax, charging the companies with failing to provide rebates to customers. =Rebates as a form of price discrimination= A common complaint against rebates is the claim that rebates can be used as a form of \\"price discrimination\\" against members of lower classes who are less likely to redeem rebates than a more educated middle class. Sridhar Moorthy, marketing professor at the University of Toronto also advocates a \\"price discrimination\\" theory between \\"people who are price- sensitive and people who are not price-sensitive\\". A different view, as taken by the BusinessWeek article, is that rebates can be viewed as a \\"tax on the disorganized\\" that is paid by those who do not submit their rebates as opposed to those who do. As mentioned above, rebates are also less enticing the more the consumer values the opportunity costs (time and effort) involved in rebate submission. Recent trends Some retailers have taken a step forward with offering consumers new ways to submit their rebates easily over the Internet, completely or partially removing any mail-in requirements. Staples, Sears, TigerDirect, and Rite Aid currently offer an online submission option for all or some of the rebates they offer. These special rebates are usually identified as such and have instructions for full or partial online submissions. This is touted as a more accurate processing of the rebate, reducing the potential for human or mechanical error and, in many cases, eliminating the postage costs associated with traditional mail-in rebates, although some require the UPC or proof of purchase to be mailed in. Most of these retailers still let consumers submit rebates by mail. In 2006, OfficeMax stores announced that they were eliminating mail-in rebates from their sales promotion in favor of instant rebates for their sale prices. The decision came after a year of working with rebate vendors and manufacturers to improve the rebate process and receiving \\"overwhelmingly negative feedback\\" from their customers about their rebate program.E. Ogg OfficeMax bids farewell to mail-in rebates June 30, 2006 Instead of checks, prepaid gift cards are being given by many stores. Merchants like these cards, as they cannot be redeemed for cash and must be spent. However, some states require that retailers redeem the card value for cash if it falls below a certain level, such as $5 in Washington state.Holiday Shopping: Consumers Have Rights Under Washington‚Äôs Gift Card Law July 15, 2011 Many sales people are not aware of this and will deny giving the refund.

The scheme, managed in partnership with the Canon Collins Educational & Legal Assistance Trust was for individuals in Southern African countries and was open to disadvantaged individuals resident in Africa who would find funding their MBA studies impossible. It was the largest known MBA Scholarship programme to be launched in Africa which would award 250 scholarships over a period of five years to people to study its flagship MBA programme. The scholarship programme was endorsed by Gra√ßa Machel, wife of former South African President Nelson Mandela, and enabled financially disadvantaged applicants across Africa to gain skills and expertise in management and business, helping them to effect change in their organisations and communities. To date, 55 scholars have graduated with their MBA and the remaining scholars are progressing well. The African Scholarship Scheme is now closed to new applications.

Elmo is located south of Abilene at the northwest corner of K-15 and K-4. History 1915 Railroad Map of Dickinson County =Early history= For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau. =19th century= In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre. In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1857, Dickinson County was established within the Kansas Territory, which included the land for modern day Elmo. Elmo started about one mile from its current location, but the source of the name is unknown. When the Missouri Pacific Railroad was built through the area, the railroad didn't like the Elmo location because it was sloping ground, so it built a station at nearby Banner City (current location of Elmo).Standard Atlas of Dickinson County, Kansas; Geo. A. Ogle & Co; Page 32 of 63; 1901.] The old Elmo post office was moved to Banner City around 1887.

History The railroad originally consisted of a 22.3 mile line between the Indiana communities of Cannelton and Santa Claus that the Port Authority purchased from Norfolk Southern in 1991. The line had been unused since the mid-1980s and Norfolk Southern was considering abandonment prior to the Port Authority's purchase. Purpose and services PCPA's goal in obtaining and putting the Hoosier Southern line back into service was (and is) to attract new industry to Perry County. When Waupaca Foundry announced plans to build a facility just north of Tell City in 1995, the Port Authority undertook construction of a spur to that site. In 1996, an additional 2.4 miles of trackage between Santa Claus and Lincoln City was added to the HOS system. This trackage was also purchased from Norfolk Southern. Combined with the Tell City River Port on the Ohio River at Tell City, the Hoosier Southern provides multimodal transportation to serve the needs of businesses in both Perry and Spencer counties. Though the Hoosier Southern is no longer part of the Norfolk Southern system, it interchanges with the NS system at Lincoln City.

Current work Today, the music primarily springs from three women with an emphasis in the body‚Äîvoices and vocal percussion, handclaps and heartbeats, sex-breath and silence. The work grows from diaspora consciousness: both Jewish and African. Stylistically, Charming Hostess incorporates doo-wop, Pygmy counterpoint, Balkan harmony and Andalusian melody. Contemporary influences on the band include Meredith Monk and Reinette l'Oranaise. The music often explores existing text and overlays the composer's (Jewlia Eisenberg) own questions of authenticity, montage, and the effect of music on non-verbal languages. The Bowls Project Album (Release Summer 2010): Based on inscriptions from ancient Babylonian Jewish amulets, The Bowls Project, as Charming Hostess. (Tzadik Records, Radical Jewish Culture, 2010) sings of mysticism and magic, angels and demons, and the trials and joys of love and sex. Especially audible are the voices of Talmudic-era women: their work, hopes and dreams. Weaving together Babylonian devotional songs, apocalyptic American folk music and a radical take on ritual power. Honored guests on 2010 The Bowls Project album include: Marc Ribot, Jenny Scheinman, Megan Gould, Jessica Troy, Nils Frykdahl, Dawn McCarthy, Ganda Suthivarakom, Boris Martzinovsky, Aaron Kierbel, and Nir Waxman. The Bowls Project Installation & Sound Sculpture: As a performance installation and interactive sound sculpture that takes place in a 40‚Äô Catalan vault designed by architect Michael Ramage. Featuring new music composed and performed by Jewlia Eisenberg and Charming Hostess, The Bowls Project is based on texts from ancient Babylonian amulets. The culmination of five years of research, The Bowls Project was exhibited at Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in 2010. The Bowls Project Background: Bowl amulets also known as Incantation bowls were common 1500 years ago in the area that is now Iraq. Simple bowls were inscribed with a householder‚Äôs secrets and desires and then buried under the doorway to protect the home. The bowl texts are about ‚Äúsecrets of the home‚Äù: love and intimacy, angels and demons, and the trials and joys of daily life. Audible in these texts are the individual voices of women from this period - their work, hopes, and dreams. These spiraled inscriptions are among the few existing records of female voices during the time and place of the Babylonian Talmud. The 2002 CD Trilectic (Tzadik Records) explored the political/erotic nexus of Walter Benjamin and his Marxist muse, Asja LƒÅcis. The 2004 CD Sarajevo Blues (Tzadik) sets Bosnian poetry by Semezdin Mehmedinoviƒá as a form of love and resistance to the brutalization of war. Their self-described genre is ‚ÄúNerdy-Sexy-Commie-Girly‚Äù. Charming Hostess is Jewlia Eisenberg, Marika Hughes, Cynthia Taylor and often Ganda Suthivarakom and Pameliya Kursten (all vocals). Early work The pre-2002 Charming Hostess (also known as Charming Hostess Big Band) was a rock band that embraced a genderfuck sensibility (the women often wore mustaches while the men wore dresses). Early Charming Hostess music drew on women's vocal traditions (primarily from Eastern Europe and North Africa), and integrated them with American folk forms both white and black. Charming Hostess was founded in the fertile anarchy of Barrington Co-op (aka Barrington Hall), and nurtured by the West Oakland arts community, along with other coeval bands such as Fibulator and Eskimo. Half of Charming Hostess was also in Idiot Flesh/Sleepytime Gorilla Museum. The final effect was of a hoedown where bodacious babes belted the blues in Bulgarian while a punk- klezmer band rocked out in accompaniment. The genre of this incarnation of ChoHo is described by the band as ‚ÄúKlezmer-Punk/Balkan-Funk‚Äù. Recordings of Charming Hostess Big Band include Eat (Vaccination, 1998) and Punch (ReR, 2005). Charming Hostess Big Band was: Jewlia Eisenberg (voice, direction), Carla Kihlstedt (voice, fiddle), Nina Rolle (voice, accordion), Wes Anderson (drums), Nils Frykdahl (guitar, flute, saxophone, percussion), and Dan Rathbun (bass).

It is also used to criticize some members of the Parti Qu√©b√©cois. Some within the party resent the use of the term by the media, but some have embraced it. It is similar to the term \\"SNP fundamentalist\\", used in Scottish politics for a faction of the Scottish National Party, another pro-independence party. Many of the first \\"purs et durs\\" came from the Rassemblement pour l'ind√©pendance nationale who, through entryism, joined the Parti Qu√©b√©cois in the early days of the 1960s. They are associated with strong opinions about independence (including the need to attain it quickly, the question of an eventual supranational union, or \\"sovereignty-association\\", and the question of the \\"√©tapisme\\" approach) and language protection (see Charter of the French Language). Some also criticize the party for not being social democratic enough. These militants have famously made the leadership of the Parti Qu√©b√©cois a test and daunting task.

The court held that although there is no general power of detention for investigative purposes, police officers may detain an individual if there are reasonable grounds to suspect in all the circumstances that the individual is connected to a particular crime and that the detention is reasonably necessary on an objective view of the circumstances. These circumstances include the extent to which the interference with individual liberty is necessary to the performance of the officer‚Äôs duty, to the liberty interfered with, and to the nature and extent of the interference. At a minimum, individuals who are detained for investigative purposes must be advised, in clear and simple language, of the reasons for the detention. Investigative detentions carried out in accordance with the common law power recognized in this case will not infringe the detainee‚Äôs rights under s. 9 of the Charter. They should be brief in duration, so compliance with s. 10(b) will not excuse prolonging, unduly and artificially, any such detention. Investigative detentions do not impose an obligation on the detained individual to answer questions posed by the police. Where a police officer has reasonable grounds to believe that his safety or the safety of others is at risk, the officer may engage in a protective pat- down search of the detained individual. The investigative detention and protective search power must be distinguished from an arrest and the incidental power to search on arrest. Background On December 23, 2000, in Winnipeg at around midnight, two police officers responded to a break and enter. While searching the neighbourhood, they spotted a young man matching the description of the suspect. He was described as a 21-year-old, 5 foot 8, Aboriginal male in a black jacket. The officers stopped the man, asked him some questions, and then gave him a pat-down. When patting the man down, the officer noticed a soft object in one of his pockets. The officer reached in and pulled out a bag containing 27 grams of marijuana. The young man was arrested and cautioned for possession for the purposes of trafficking under section 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. At trial the judge found that the search violated section 8 of the Charter and that the bag must be excluded from evidence as it would interfere with the fairness of justice under section 24(2) of the Charter. The judge found that the pat-down was reasonable for security purposes only, but reaching into the suspect's pockets was not for that purpose. On appeal the Court found that the search and detention were within reason given the circumstances, thus the acquittal was set aside and a new trial was ordered. The following issues were put to the Court: # whether there exists, at common law, a police power to detain individuals for investigative purposes # if so, whether there exists a concomitant common law power of search incident to such investigative detentions. # whether any existing detention and/or search power was properly exercised; # if the appellant's rights were violated, whether the evidence ought to be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Reasons of the court The Court found that the trial judge was correct and the acquittal should be restored. The opinion of the Court was given by Iacobucci J., joined by Major, Binnie, LeBel, and Fish JJ., with Deschamps and Bastarache JJ. in dissent. Justice Iaccobucci held that where a police officer detains a suspect on reasonable grounds they are allowed to give a pat-down only as a protective measure. Any search for the purposes of detecting and collecting evidence will not have been on reasonable grounds. In the current case, the initial pat-down was minimally intrusive. However, the search of the pocket must be grounded in a reasonable justification, which in the case has no justification.

Astrolabe and Boussole Roads were named after the two ships commanded by La Perouse, the French explorer who arrived at Botany Bay just days after the First Fleet in 1788.Dictionary of Sydney =Trams= The Daceyville tram line opened in 1913 with services from Circular Quay via Waterloo. The line branched from the Botany Road line at Gardeners Road, and passed east along Gardeners Road to join the lines at Anzac Pde at what was known as Daceyville Junction. It included a large collection of sidings at the former Rosebery Racecourse, now the site of The Lakes Golf Course. Some services were extended to Maroubra Beach via the Anzac Parade lines. The line closed in 1957. =Public school= The school is situated on a five-acre site between Bunnerong Road and Banks Avenue. Application was originally made for a public school in the area in 1913, but only an infants school was initially approved. This opened at Astrolabe Road in 1914. It became a primary school in 1917. As the suburb grew, the school became inadequate and a new site of five acres was obtained from the Housing Board, at the present site. A new building was constructed in 1921, but the new school rapidly outgrew its new premises, leading to further extensions that were completed in 1925.nsw public schools Population According to the 2016 census, there were 1,209 residents in Daceyville. 6.6% of residents were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, more than the national average of 2.8%.

He taught at Michigan State University, the University of Western Ontario, Washington State University, and the University of Southern California. A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Rokeach as the 85th most cited psychologist of the 20th century. Early life Born to Jewish parents in Hrubiesz√≥w, Poland, Rokeach emigrated to the United States with his parents at age seven. After graduating from Brooklyn College, he received his Ph.D degree from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1947. Contributions to psychology Rokeach conducted a well-known experiment in which he observed the interaction of three mentally ill patients at Ypsilanti State Hospital, each of whom believed he was Jesus Christ, from 1959 to 1961. The book he wrote about the experiment, The Three Christs of Ypsilanti, was subsequently adapted into a screenplay, a stage play, two operas and a movie. Rokeach also conducted a mid-20th‚Äìcentury study in the American South in which he tried to determine the basis for racial prejudice. He found racial prejudice to be inversely related to socio-economic status and thus concluded that such bias is used in an attempt to elevate one's own status.T.L. Brink. (2008) Psychology: A Student Friendly Approach. \\"Unit 13: Social Psychology.\\" pp. 300 His book The Nature of Human Values (1973) and the Rokeach Value Survey (see values scales), which the book served as the test manual for, occupied the final years of his career. In it, he posited that a relatively few \\"terminal human values\\" are the internal reference points that all people use to formulate attitudes and opinions, and that by measuring the \\"relative ranking\\" of these values one could predict a wide variety of behavior, including political affiliation and religious belief. This theory led to a series of experiments in which changes in values led to measurable changes in opinion for an entire small city in the state of Washington. Awards In 1984, Rokeach received the Kurt Lewin Memorial Award of the American Psychological Association. In 1988, he received the Harold Lasswell Award of the International Society of Political Psychology.

It is a 10-minute walk from the Montmorency metro station in nearby Laval-des-Rapides. Centre Laval is paired with Quartier Laval, a power centre across the street owned by the same company, with which it makes a shopping complex called DUO. Though located only away from the bigger and more popular Carrefour Laval, Centre Laval is a large shopping mall in its own right with nearly of retail space. It has 130 shops, services and department stores, including anchors Hudson's Bay, Marshall's/HomeSense, The Brick, Best Buy, Staples, Lee Valley, and Sportium. Other tenants of importance include Sports Experts, Mark's and Ares. There is also a branch of the Bank of Montreal. History Centre Laval was Laval's first modern, enclosed shopping mall. Until then the block-long St Martin strip mall built in 1956 by Ivanhoe had been the largest. Centre Laval began in 1968 with 50 stores and anchored by Famous Players theatre, Woolco and Steinberg's. A mall expansion was supposed to be anchored by Morgan. But by the time the expansion was completed, the Morgan chain had been renamed to The Bay and the store at Centre Laval inaugurated on August 17, 1972 under the new banner. Centre Laval had two more expansions before reaching its current size in 1988. The Woolco store became a Walmart when the company purchased Woolco Canada in 1994 to establish a Canadian presence. Staples Canada acquired the lease of the defunct office supply chain Club Biz and opened its Centre Laval store on June 1, 1996. Club Biz, which was founded in 1991 by executives of Steinberg's, had taken over in 1993 the space at Centre Laval of the defunct supermarket following the latter's closing in 1992. Walmart left Centre Laval in November 2012 to relocate as a Walmart Supercentre on the site formerly occupied by Centre 2000. Walmart's location at Centre Laval was demolished to allow a Target store on its emplacement from 2013 to 2015. As of September 2017, part of that space is now occupied by a Sportium sport equipment store. In 2018 more space is being occupied by Avril Supermarch√© Sant√©, Marshalls and HomeSense. Lee Valley opened its first store in the province on October 3, 2018. On September 26, 2019, Centre Laval merged with its sister shopping centre Quartier Laval, a power centre located the other side of the street that is also owned by Cominar. The combined property is called DUO and regroups the tenants of both shopping centres. A website was launched for the new complex whose presence is expected to gradually rise on social media. Quartier Laval was built in 2008 and is currently anchored by Winners, Indigo and the headquarters of Nordia Inc. Ownership In April 2007, Homburg Invest Inc acquired Alexis Nihon REIT and thereby officially took ownership of the shopping centre. Centre Laval was transferred to Homburg Canada REIT in 2009 which eventually changed to Canmarc Real Estate Investment Trust in September 2011. Since March 2012, Centre Laval is owned and managed by Cominar following its acquisition of Canmarc.

The Moroccan Goumiers () were indigenous Moroccan soldiers who served in auxiliary units attached to the French Army of Africa, between 1908 and 1956. While nominally in the service of the Sultan of Morocco, they served under French officers, including as part of the Free French Forces. Employed initially as tribal irregulars, then in regular contingents, the goumiers were employed extensively during the French occupation of Morocco from 1908 to the early 1930s. They then served in Italy and France during World War II between 1942 and 1945. During this period four Moroccan Tabors Groupments (GTM) were created, each comprising 3 Tabors (battalion) with 3 to 4 Goums (companies). Goumiers then served in Indochina from 1946 to 1954. Etymology The term Goum designated a company of Goumiers. It originates from the Arab Maghreb g≈´m and the Classical Arabic qawm, designating ‚Äùtribe‚Äù or ‚Äùpeople‚Äù. The term also refers to mounted contingents of Arab or Berber horsemen employed by tribal leaders during North African campaigns.D√©finition de GOUMIER ‚Äì CNRTL The term tabor is originally a Turkish designation of tabur making reference to a battalion or by the intermediary Arab ·π≠ƒÅb≈´r, also originally a Turkish designation.D√©finition de TABOR ‚Äì CNRTL The word originated in the Maghrebi Arabic word Koum (ŸÇŸàŸÖ), which means \\"people\\". The non-specific designation \\"Goumi\\" (French version \\"Goumier\\") was used to circumvent tribal distinctions and enable volunteers from different regions to serve together in mixed units for a \\"common\\" cause. In French military terminology, a goum was a unit of 200 auxiliaries. Three or four goums made up a tabor. An engine or groupe was composed of three tabors. A goum in this case was the equivalent of a company in regular military units and a tabor would thereby be equivalent to a battalion. A tabor was the largest permanent goumier unit. In addition to colonial campaigns during the first half of the 20th century, goumiers were employed as auxiliaries by the French Army in Italy during World War II. These irregular infantry came from the Atlas Mountains of Morocco where they were recruited from the indigenous Berber tribes.Bimberg, Edward L. The Moroccan Goums: Tribal Warriors in a Modern War Origins The designation of \\"goumiers\\" was originally given to tribal irregulars employed as allies by the French Army during the early 1900s in southern Algeria. These mounted allies operated under their own tribal leadership and were entirely distinct from the regular Muslim cavalry (Spahi) and infantry (Tirailleur) regiments of the French Arm√©e d'Afrique.Maghraoui, Driss. Moroccan colonial soldiers: between selective memory and collective memory ‚Äì Beyond Colonialism and Nationalism in North Africa. Arab Studies Quarterly (ASQ), Spring, 1998 Tribal police auxiliaries serving with the French gendarmerie in the settled areas of Algeria were also known as goumiers. Morocco, 1908‚Äì34 Algerian goumiers were employed during the initial stages of the French intervention in Morocco, commencing in 1908. After their terms of enlistment expired, the Algerians returned to their homeland, but the advantages of indigenous irregulars were such that they were replaced by Moroccan levies. Retaining the designation of goumiers, the Moroccans served in detachments under French officers, and initially mostly Algerian NCOs, both of whom were usually seconded from the Spahis and Tirailleurs.Pages 280‚Äì283 Vol. 1 \\"Zouaves & Tirailleurs: les regiments de marche et les regiments mixtes\\" Jean-Louis Larcade, Moroccan sous-officers were in due course appointed. These semi-permanently employed Moroccan goumiers were initially raised as six separate detachments of local militia by General Albert D'Amade in 1908, to patrol recently-occupied areas. Goumiers also served as scouts and in support of regular French troops, and in 1911 they became permanent units.Jacques Augarde, page 10 \\"La longue route des tabors\\", √©ditions France Empire, 1983 () Nominally, the goumiers were under the control of the Sultan of Morocco, but in practice they formed an extension of the French Army and subsequently fought for France in third countries (see below). However, their biggest involvement was in Morocco itself during the period of French \\"pacification\\". As noted below, the goum units had the formal status of local police, though they fought and served as an integral part of the French Army of Africa. This had initially been a political subterfuge, since following the Algeciras Conference of 1906, France had undertaken not to recruit regular Moroccan troops while the Sultan remained nominal ruler of the country. With the outbreak of World War I this restraint was lifted and the French enlisted large numbers of regular Moroccan tirailleurs, spahis and artillerymen. The goumiers had however proven so valuable as auxilaries that they continued their dual roles as tribal police and combat troops.Military Intelligence Division, General Staff, Foreign Military Notes, The Field Artillery Journal, pages 395‚Äì404, July‚ÄìAugust 1925 Initially, the Moroccan Goums wore tribal dress with only blue cloaks as uniform items, but as they achieved permanent status they adopted the distinctive brown and grey striped jellaba (a hooded Moroccan cloak) that was to remain their trademark throughout their history with the French Army. Their normal headdress was a turban. Goums included both infantry and cavalry elements. Their traditional and favoured weapons were sabres or elongated daggers. An equivalent force known as the Mehal-La Jalifiana was raised in Spanish Morocco using France's goumiers as a model. World War I A Goumier cavalryman (in this case an Algerian spahi irregular) at Saleux (Somme), May‚ÄìJune 1915 during World War I. The Moroccan Goumiers did not see service outside Morocco during the First World War, although the term was sometimes used for detachments of Algerian spahi irregulars employed in Flanders in late 1914. Their existence did, however, enable General Hubert Lyautey to withdraw a substantial portion of the regular French military forces from Morocco for service on the Western Front. Between the world wars By 1924 twenty-seven Goum units were in the French service. They comprised mixed detachments of about three-quarters infantry and one-quarter cavalry. Together with partisan tribal irregulars the goumiers numbered about 10,000 men. French officers and NCOs continued to be seconded from regular units.Military Intelligence Division, General Staff, Foreign Military Notes, The Field Artillery Journal, pages 395‚Äì404, July‚ÄìAugust 1925 Remaining separate from the regular Moroccan regiments of the French Arm√©e d'Afrique, the Goumiers gave valuable service during the Rif Wars of the 1920s. They subsequently became a form of gendarmerie, keeping order in rural districts of Morocco. World War II Yank magazine, shown sharpening his bayonet. Four Moroccan groups (regimental-sized units, about 12 000 men in total) served with the Allied forces during World War II. They specialised in night raiding operations, and fought against the forces of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany during 1942‚Äì45. Goumier units were also used to man the front lines in mountainous and other rough terrain areas, freeing regular Allied infantry units to operate along more profitable axes of advance. =North Africa 1940‚Äì42= In May 1940, 12 Moroccan Goums were organized as the 1st Group of Moroccan Auxiliaries (French: 1er Groupe de Suppl√©tifs Marocains ‚Äì G.S.M.) and used in combat against Italian troops operating out of Libya. After the armistice of 1940, the Goums were returned to Morocco. To evade strict German limits on how many troops France could maintain in North Africa, the Goumiers were described as having Gendarmerie-type functions, such as maintenance of public order and the surveillance of frontiers, while maintaining military armament, organization, and discipline.Gaujac, p. 68 =Tunisia, 1942‚Äì43= The 1st GSM (Groupe de Suppl√©tifs Marocains) fought on the Tunisian front as part of the Moroccan March Division from December 1942, and was joined by the 2nd GSM in January 1943. The 15th Army Group commander, British General Harold Alexander considered the French Moroccan Goumiers as \\"great fighters\\" and gave them to the allies to help them to take Bizerte and Tunis.To help them I gave them the French Moroccan Goumiers, who were experienced mountain troops and great fighters, Harold Alexander, The Alexander Memoirs, 1940‚Äì1945, Londres, Cassell, 1962, pp. 37‚Äì38 After the Tunisia Campaign, the French organized two additional groups and retitled the groups as Groupement de Tabors Marocains (G.T.M.) Each group contained a command Goum (company) and three Tabors (battalions) of three Goums each. A Tabor contained four 81-mm mortars and totalled 891 men. Each infantry Goum was authorized 210 men, one 60-mm mortar, two light machine guns, and seven automatic rifles.Gaujac, p. 58 Separate from the groups, the 14th Tabor did not participate in the fighting in Europe and remained in Morocco to keep public order for the remainder of the war. =Italy, 1943‚Äì45= The 4th Tabor of Moroccan Goums fought in the Sicilian Campaign, landing at Licata on 14 July 1943, and was attached to the U.S. Seventh Army, commanded by Lieutenant General George S. Patton.Fran√ßois Lescel (2002), F√©d√©ration des Amicales R√©gimentaires et des Anciens Combattants website article no. 366 (March 2002) \\"Goumiers, Goums, Tabors\\" (French language text) The Goumiers of the 4th Tabor were attached to the U.S. 1st Infantry Division on 27 July 1943 and were recorded in the U.S. 26th Infantry Regiment's log files for their courage. Upon their arrival many Italian soldiers surrendered en masse, while the Germans began staging major retreats away from known Goumiers presence. The Italian campaign of World War II is perhaps the most famous and most controversial in the history of the Goumiers. The 4th Group of Moroccan Tabors shipped out for Italy in November 1943 and was followed in January 1944 by the 3rd Group, then reinforced by the 1st Group in April 1944. In Italy, the Allies suffered a long stalemate at the German Gustav Line. In May 1944, three Goumier groupes, under the name Corps de Montagne, were the vanguard of the French Expeditionary Corps (CEF), under General Alphonse Juin, attack through the Aurunci Mountains during Operation Diadem, the fourth and final Battle of Monte Cassino. \\"Here the Goums more than proved their value as light, highly mobile mountain troops who could penetrate the most vertical terrain in fighting order and with a minimum of logistical requirements. Most military analysts consider the Goumiers' manoeuvre as the critical victory that finally opened the way to the Italian capital of Rome.\\" The U.S. Fifth Army commander, Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark, also paid tribute to the Goumiers and the Moroccan regulars of the Tirailleur units: :In spite of the stiffening enemy resistance, the 2nd Moroccan Division penetrated the Gustave [sic] Line in less than two day‚Äôs fighting. The next 48 hours on the French front were decisive. The knife-wielding Goumiers swarmed over the hills, particularly at night, and General Juin‚Äôs entire force showed an aggressiveness hour after hour that the Germans could not withstand. Cerasola, San Giorgio, Mt. D‚ÄôOro, Ausonia and Esperia were seized in one of the most brilliant and daring advances of the war in Italy... For this performance, which was to be a key to the success of the entire drive on Rome, I shall always be a grateful admirer of General Juin and his magnificent FEC. During their fighting in the Italian Campaign, the Goumiers suffered 3,000 casualties, of which 600 were killed in action. Reported atrocities The military achievements of the Goumiers in Italy were accompanied by widespread reports of war crimes: \\"...exceptional numbers of Moroccans were executed‚Äîmany without trial‚Äîfor allegedly murdering, raping, and pillaging their way across the Italian countryside. The French authorities sought to defuse the problem by importing numbers of Berber women to serve as \\"camp followers\\" in rear areas set aside exclusively for the Goumiers.\\" According to Italian sources, more than 7,000 people were raped by Goumiers. Those rapes, later known in Italy as Marocchinate, were against women, children and men, including some priests. The mayor of Esperia (a comune in the Province of Frosinone), reported that in his town, 700 women out of 2,500 inhabitants were raped and that some had died as a result. In northern Latium and southern Tuscany, it is alleged that the Goumiers raped and occasionally killed women and young men after the Germans retreated, including members of partisan formations.. On the other hand a British journalist commented, ‚ÄúThe Goums have become a legend, a joke‚Ä¶ No account of their rapes or their other acts is too eccentric to be passed off as true.‚ÄùParker, Matthew. Monte Cassino: The story of the hardest-fought battle of World War Two. p. 269 The CEF executed 15 soldiers by firing squad and sentenced 54 others to hard labor in military prisons for acts of rape or murder.Gaujac, p. 69 In 2015, the Italian state recognized compensation to a victim of these events. =Corsica, 1943= In September 1943 the 2nd Group of Moroccan Tabors participated in the liberation of Corsica, and fought the Germans in the mountains near Bastia, by Cape Corse. =Elba, 1944= The 2nd Group of Moroccan Tabors was part of the French Forces that took Elba from the Germans in June 1944. The operation was called Operation Brassard. The island was more heavily defended than expected, and there were many casualties on both sides as a result of the severe fighting. =Mainland France, 1944= The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Groups of Moroccan Tabors fought in the campaigns in southern France, Vosges Mountains, and Alsace during late 1944 and early 1945. The Goumiers started landing in southern France on 18 August 1944. Attached to the 3rd Algerian Infantry Division, all three groups took part in the combat to liberate Marseille from 20 to 28 August 1944. The 1st Group was subsequently used to secure France's Alpine frontier with Italy until late October 1944, and then took part in the forcing of the Belfort Gap in November. During late September and early October 1944, the 2nd and 3rd Groups fought in the areas of Remiremont and G√©rardmer. All three groups fought in the Vosges Mountains during November and December 1944, facing extremely cold weather and bitter German resistance. After hard fighting in the Vosges Mountains and the Colmar Pocket, the 3rd Group was repatriated to Morocco in April 1945. It was replaced in Europe by the 4th Group, which had returned to North Africa after French forces left Italy.Gaujac, p. 71 =Germany, 1945= The 1st, 2nd, and 4th Groups of Moroccan Tabors fought in the final operations to overrun southwestern Germany in 1945. The 1st Group fought through the Siegfried Line in the Bienwald from 20 to 25 March 1945. In April 1945, the 1st and 4th Groups took part in the fighting to seize Pforzheim. During the last weeks of the war, the 2nd Group fought in the Black Forest and pushed southeast to Germany's Austrian border. During the same period, the 1st and 4th Groups advanced with other French forces on Stuttgart and T√ºbingen. By mid-1946, all three groups had been repatriated to Morocco. Goumier casualties in World War II from 1942 to 1945 totaled 8,018 of which 1,625 were killed in action. Indochina, 1949‚Äì1954 Following World War II Moroccan goumiers saw service in French Indo-China from June 1949 until the fall of Dien Bien Phu in 1954. Stationed in the northern frontier zone of Tonkin, the goumier units were used mainly for convoy escort and quadrillage de zone (regional search and destroy) duties. By contrast with the regular Moroccan tirailleurs, who enlisted for fixed terms of service, the goumiers were contracted to serve specifically in Indo-China for the period of hostilities only.Olivier Bellec \\"Les Tabors Marocains\\", Militaria 292, Novembre 2009 As in previous campaigns, the goumiers were organised in battalion sized Tabors, each comprising several Goums or companies. The proportion of French officers to Moroccan other ranks was low, with normally only two in each company. Locally recruited Indochinese auxiliaries were attached to each Tabor as reconnaissance units. Brigaded for administrative purposes in the Groupement de Tabors Marocain d'Extreme Orient there were, at any one time, usually three Tabors serving in Indochina during the war against the Viet Minh. In October 1950 the 11e Tabor was overrun at Na Kheo, with only 369 survivors out of 924 goumiers and French officers.\\"The French Indochina War 1946‚Äì54\\", Martin Windrow, During this, their final campaign in French service, the goumiers continued, at least for parade and in cold weather, to wear the distinctive flat-topped turbans and brown-striped djellabas that had distinguished these units since 1911. Following Moroccan independence With Moroccan independence in 1956, the Goums were incorporated into the new Royal Army of Morocco. Following negotiations between the French, Spanish and Moroccan governments, it was agreed that both regular and auxiliary Moroccan units could be transferred into the new Forces Arm√©es Royales or FAR. Fourteen thousand Moroccan personnel were accordingly transferred from French service. The modern Moroccan military includes both a Royal Gendarmerie and Auxiliary Force Companies. Both forces have an overlapping rural policing role and are in that sense the successors of the Goumiers.

Denistone is located 16 kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of the City of Ryde. Denistone West and Denistone East are separate suburbs. History Denistone is derived from the name of a home built in the area called Dennistone. The Wallumedegal Aboriginal tribe lived in the area between the Lane Cove River and Parramatta River, which was known as Walumetta. Gregory Blaxland, a free settler, purchased the Brush Farm estate in 1806, shortly after his arrival in the colony. This estate covered most of the area south from Terry Road to Victoria Road and Tramway Street, and east from Brush Road to Shaftsbury Road. In 1829 Blaxland transferred Brush Farm Estate to his eldest daughter, Elizabeth, and her husband Dr Thomas Forster. Forster expanded the estate by purchasing the Porteous Mount grants of on the Denistone ridge in 1830. Denistone was named after Forster's home \\"Dennistone\\", burnt down by bushfires in 1855. Richard Rouse Terry acquired the land from the Blaxlands in 1872 where he rebuilt Denistone House, now within the grounds of Ryde Hospital.

Living through a turbulent time in the history of his native Barcelona, he was known as a portraitist, sketching and painting the intellectual, economic, and political elite of Barcelona, Paris, Madrid, and beyond; he was also known for his paintings of crowd scenes ranging from the audience at a bullfight to the assembly for an execution to rioters in the Barcelona streets. Also a graphic designer, his posters and postcards helped to define the Catalan art movement known as modernisme. Barcelona and Paris Self-portrait as a flamenco dancer, 1883 Share of the Hispano Suiza Fabrica de Automoviles SA, designed by Ram√≥n Casas with the Italian actress Teresa Mariani as motif Casas was born in Barcelona. His father had made a fortune in Matanzas, Cuba; his mother was from a well-off Catalan family. In 1877 he abandoned the regular course of schooling to study art in the studio of Joan Vicens. In 1881, still in his teens, he was a co-founder of the magazine L'Aven√ß; the 9 October 1881 issue included his sketch of the cloister of Sant Benet in Bages. That same month, accompanied by his cousin Miquel Carb√≥ i Carb√≥, a medical student, he began his first stay in Paris, where he studied that winter at the Carolus Duran Academy and later at the Gervex Academy, and functioned as a Paris correspondent for L'Aven√ß. The next year he had a piece exhibited in Barcelona at the Sala Par√©s, and in 1883 in Paris the Salon des Champs Elys√©es exhibited his portrait of himself dressed as a flamenco dancer; the piece won him an invitation as a member of the salon of the Societ√© d'artistes fran√ßaises. The next few years he continued to paint and travel, spending most autumns and winters in Paris and the rest of the year in Spain, mostly in Barcelona but also in Madrid and Granada; his 1886 painting of the crowd at the Madrid bullfighting ring was to be the first of many highly detailed paintings of crowds. That year he survived tuberculosis, and convalesced for the winter in Barcelona. Among the artists he met in this period of his life, and who influenced him, were Laure√† Barrau, Santiago Rusi√±ol, Eug√®ne Carri√®re, Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, and Ignacio Zuloaga. Casas and Rusi√±ol traveled through Catalonia in 1889, and collaborated on a short book Por Catalu√±a (desde mi carro), with text by Rusi√±ol and illustrations by Casas. Returning together to Paris, they lived together at the Moulin de la Galette in Montmartre, along with painter and art critic Miquel Utrillo and the sketch artist Ram√≥n Canudas. Rusi√±ol chronicled these times in as series of articles \\"Desde el Molino\\" (\\"From the Mill\\") for La Vanguardia; again Casas illustrated. Casas became an associate of the Societ√© d'artistes fran√ßaises, allowing him to exhibit two works annually at their salon without having to pass through jury competition. With Rusi√±ol and with sculptor Enric Claras√≥ he exhibited at Sala Par√©s in 1890; his work from this period, such as Plen Air and the Bal du Moulin de la Galette lies somewhere between an academic style and that of the French impressionists. The style that would become known as modernisme had not yet fully come together, but the key people were beginning to know one another, and successful Catalan artists were increasingly coming to identify themselves with Barcelona as much as with Paris. His fame continued to spread through Europe and beyond as he exhibited successfully in Madrid (1892, 1894), Berlin (1891, 1896) and at the World Columbian Exposition in Chicago (1893); meanwhile the bohemian circle that included Casas and Rusi√±ol began with greater frequency to organize exhibitions of their own in Barcelona and Sitges. With this increasing activity in Catalonia, he settled more in Barcelona, but continued to travel to Paris for the annual Salons. Jove decadent, 1899. Els Quatre Gats The emerging modernista art world gained a center with the opening of Els Quatre Gats, a bar modeled on Le Chat Noir in Paris. Casas largely financed this bar on the ground floor of Casa Mart√≠, a building by Architect Josep Puig i Cadafalch in Montsi√≥ Street near the center of Barcelona; it opened in June 1897 and lasted for six years (and was later reconstructed in 1978). His partners in the enterprise were Pere Romeu, who largely played host to the bar, as well as Rusi√±ol and Miquel Utrillo. The bar hosted tertulias and revolving art exhibits, including one of the first one-man shows by Pablo Picasso; the most prominent piece in its permanent collection was a lighthearted Casas self-portrait, depicting him smoking a pipe while pedaling a tandem bicycle with Romeu as his stoker. The original of the painting--or most of it: nearly a third of the canvas was cut away by an intervening owner --is now in Barcelona's Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya (MNAC); a creditable reproduction resides in the revived Els Quatre Gats. Like Le Chat Noir, Els Quatre Gats attempted its own literary and artistic magazine, to which Casas was a major contributor. That was short-lived, but was soon followed by P√®l & Ploma, which would slightly outlast the bar itself, and Forma (1904-1908), to which Casas also contributed. P√®l & Ploma sponsored several prominent art exhibitions, including Casas' own well-received first solo show (1899 at Sala Par√©s), which brought together a retrospective of his oil paintings as well as a set of charcoal sketches of contemporary figures prominent in Barcelona's cultural life. While his painting career continued successfully through this period, as part owner of a bar Casas engaged heavily in graphic design, adopting the art nouveau style that would come to define modernisme. He designed posters for the caf√©, many of which depicted Romeu's gaunt visage. He also executed a series of advertisements for Codorniu, a brand of cava (or, as its ads of the time claimed, champagne) and anisette. Over the next decade, he would design poster ads for everything from cigarette papers to the Enciclop√®dia Espasa. His prominence grows The Charge or Barcelona 1902 For the 1900 Exposition Universelle (1900) in Paris, the Spanish committee chose two of Casas' full-length oil portraits: an 1891 portrait of Erik SatieAvril in Paris at www.artnet.com and an 1895 portrait of Casas' sister Elisa. His 1894 Garrote Vil --a portrayal of an execution-- won a major prize in Munich in 1901; his work was shown not only in the major capitals of Europe, but as far away as Buenos Aires, Argentina. In 1902, twelve of his canvasses were installed permanently in the rotunda of the Cercle de Liceu, the exclusive private club associated with Barcelona's famous opera house. In 1903 he became a full Societaire of the Salon du Champ de Mars in Paris, which would have allowed him to exhibit there annually, but in fact he only exhibited there for two more years. In 1903, his piece for the salon was one that had originally been called La Carga (The Charge), which he retitled Barcelona 1902 in reference to a recent general strike, although in fact the painting, which shows Guardia Civil routing a crowd, had been executed at least two years before that strike. In 1904, the same piece won first prize at the General Exposition in Madrid. During a 1904 sojourn in Madrid, he produced a series of sketches of the Madrid intelligentsia, and befriended painters Eliseu Meifr√®n and Joaqu√≠n Sorolla, as well as Agust√≠ Querol Subirats, official sculptor to the Spanish government. In Querol's studio, he executed an equestrian portrait of the king, Alfonso XIII, which was soon purchased by the American collector Charles Deering, who, over the next few years would commission or purchase several of Casas paintings. 1900 J√∫lia Peraire La Sargantaine, c. 1907, portrait of J√∫lia Peraire Increasingly in demand as a portraitist, he settled again for a while in Barcelona. Shortly thereafter he made the acquaintance of a young artist's model named J√∫lia Peraire, 22 years his junior. He first painted her in 1906 when she was 18. She soon became his favorite model and his lover. His family did not approve of her; they eventually married, but not until 1922. Patronage and stardom Casas' mother purchased the monastery of Sant Benet de Bages in 1907 and hired Puig i Cadafalch to restore it. Casas would spend much time there, and would repeatedly depict the monastery and its surroundings. Five years later, when his mother died, he inherited the monastery. Casas portrait of Charles Deering, c. 1914 In 1908 Casas and his now-patron Deering traveled through Catalonia. Deering purchased a former hospital in Sitges to transform it into a sometime residence. Miquel Utrillo dubbed it Marycel. Later that year, Casas began a six-month journey to Cuba and the United States at Deering's invitation. During this time, he executed a dozen oil portraits and over thirty charcoal drawings of Deering's friends and associates. Returning to Spain in April 1909, he put on a solo shows in both Barcelona and Madrid. At the Fayan√ß Catal√† gallery in Barcelona, he displayed 200 charcoal sketches, which he then donated to the Museo de Barcelona. His show in Madrid was at the Ministry of Tourism, and featured portraits of the city's leading figures, including the king. His life continued in this vein for some time. In 1910 executed a painting of the funeral of his friend the art critic and novelist Raim√≥n Casellas, who had committed suicide the previous year shortly after Barcelona's semana tr√°gica and, for Deering, painted a second version of La Carga, this time with the prominent foreground figure of a Guardia Civil on foot rather than on horseback. Over the remaining years before World War I he traveled extensively in Spain and Europe, sometimes alone and sometimes with Deering, visiting Vienna, Budapest, Munich, Paris, the Netherlands, Madrid, and Galicia. He continued to have major exhibits in Spain and France. In 1913 he acquired an architecturally notable home in Barcelona, a tower on Carrer de San Gervasi (now Carrer de les Carolines) in the Sant Gervasi neighborhood; in 1915, he, Rusi√±ol, and Clarass√≥ exhibited together in the Sala Par√©s, celebrating the 25th anniversary of their first joint exhibition there. Over My Dead Body (Ramon Casas) Tamarit and after Anti-tuberculosis poster, 1929 In 1916, Casas and Deering traveled to Tamarit in Catalonia. Deering purchased the entire village, and placed Casas in charge of the project of restoring it. Several years later, in 1924, he would return to Tamarit to paint numerous landscapes. Also in 1916, Deering purchased a house in Sitges, known as Can Xicarrons (now a museum), and the magazine Vell i Nou dedicated an issue to Casas. Up until this time, Casas had kept his distance from the battles of World War I, but in 1918 he visited the front; he painted a self- portrait wearing a military cape. thumb Casas, Rusi√±ol, and Claras√≥ resumed regular annual joint exhibitions at Sala Par√©s in 1921; these continued until Rusi√±ol's death in 1931. However, that year he had a falling out with his friend Utrillo over Maricel Casas's close association with Deering; the breach was never healed. In 1922, Casas finally married J√∫lia Peraire, and in 1924 she came along with him on a trip to the United States, during which he once again made portraits of the rich and famous. Portada de Hispania (revista) n¬∫4 By the 1920s, Casas had fallen far away from the avant-gardiste tendencies of his youth. If anything, his work from this period looks like it came from an academic painter of an earlier time than his work of the 1890s. He continued painting landscapes and portraits, as well as anti-tuberculosis posters and the like, but by the time of his death in 1932, shortly after the emergence of the Second Spanish Republic, he was already more a figure of the past than the present.

It is a sequel to Sheldon's 1973 bestseller The Other Side of Midnight. Plot summary The plot of Memories of Midnight takes off from the ending of The Other Side of Midnight, where Catherine Douglas is recovering in a convent. The world except Constantin Demiris, known as Costa, thinks that Catherine has been killed by her husband, Larry Douglas, and his mistress, Noelle Page. But Catherine wants to discover herself and know who she is. The only thing she knows is that her name is Catherine Alexander. She requests to see the world outside the convent to reveal her past. This request is granted by the Sister of the convent, but only after getting the approval from their multimillionaire mentor, Constantin Demiris. It is in Greece that she realizes that her husband and his mistress tried to kill her. She remembers them trying to drown her, and this becomes a recurring dream. When she tells all this to Costa, he is a bit angry as he didn‚Äôt want her uncovering her past, as she is the last link to the case in which Larry and Noelle were wrongly accused of killing her and sentenced to death. So he sends her off to London to work in one of his offices. At this time, Constantin Demiris seems like a benefactor to Catherine. Trouble starts brewing when Frederick Stavros begins to feel guilty for sending Larry and Noelle to their death, as he was their lawyer and they were all tricked into pleading guilty by Napoleon Chotas. He dies shortly after confiding this news to a priest, who then tells an employee working in the office of Spyros Lambrou, the brother of Costa's wife Melina. This news reaches Spyros Lambrou, who uses this news to destroy Costa, as Costa had mistreated his wife, Spyros' sister. This is when Napoleon Chotas starts fearing for his own life. He leaves a package with a prosecuting attorney, Peter Demonides, and sends a tape referring to this to Costa. The next day Chotas' house is burned down. He seemingly dies, and the package is delivered to Costa, rather than the authorities, by Peter, who starts working for him. Meanwhile, Catherine finds a good friend in Kirk Reynolds, who is in love with her and wants to marry her, although Catherine is a bit reluctant. She confides in him that her husband and his mistress attempted to kill her and were executed for it. Kirk reassures her by saying that, from the little he knows about Greek law, he is confident that their law doesn't sentence anyone to death on account of attempted murder. Still, he will make sure by asking one of his acquaintances, Peter Demonides. Within a day of relating Catherine's story to Peter, he dies. In the meantime, Spyros tries to destroy Costa by narrating this incident to a drug dealer, Tony Rizzoli, and advises him to trick Costa into taking one of his drug shipments to USA. But Constantin Demiris kills Tony, destroys his shipment, and then threatens Spyros by telling him that he will destroy him but will first take care of his sister. When Spyros tells this to Melina, she assures him by saying that she can take care of herself. Her brother's house is attacked but he and his wife survive the attack. This is when she becomes confident that Costa wants to destroy them. Hence, she kills herself and fakes it so that it seems that Constantin Demiris murdered her. Meanwhile, Costa has ordered the killing of Catherine Alexander. Costa gets arrested for the murder of his wife. The only one who can save him is Sypros Lambrou, who can give an alibi for the time of the murder, but won't do so as he detests Constantin Demiris and wants him dead. This is when Napoleon Chotas makes a reappearance, crippled and in a wheelchair, after mysteriously surviving the fire that burned his house. He fights the case of Constantine Demiris. He convinces Spyros into giving testimony for Costa, arguing that, instead of having him dead, it will be better if he forces him to live in poverty. This would be achieved by Costa transferring all the assets of his company to Spyros in return for Spyros' testimony. On the other hand, Costa and Chotas have already planned that the assets of Costa's company will first be shifted to a firm owned by Napoleon Chotas, so that Spyros will get nothing. Catherine goes into psychoanalysis and falls in love with the doctor, Alan Hamilton, who also falls in love with her. Three men arrive in London to study the operation there, and they all seem pretty weird. She has a bad feeling about them, but it is not until she is to be killed that she realizes that it is not the three men but the office boy who came along with them who has come to kill her. He tries to kill her by locking and tying her up in the basement and turning up the thermostat of the boiler, which will explode when it reaches , but she manages to survive by hiding in the bomb shelter. She comes to know the truth about Costa and also that he was convicted. She marries Alan. Constantin Demiris is being tried for a murder he didn't commit but, on the last day of the 10-day trial, Spyros Lambrou testifies, setting Constantin free. Afterwards, on the way to Napoleon's home, Napoleon confides in Costa that even though he liked Noelle Page, he still helped him in killing her. He starts driving faster and tells him that he has donated all the assets of his company to the convent, since he has no wish of being alive after what Costa did to him. Finally, he drives the car over the cliff down the steep mountainside, killing both Constantin Demiris and himself.  Adaptation  In 1991, the book was adapted for television as a two-part miniseries directed by Gary Nelson starring Omar Sharif as Constantin Demiris and Jane Seymour as Catherine Alexander. The miniseries follows the events of the book very closely. However, the connection with the preceding book (The Other Side of Midnight), which had been turned into a 1977 motion picture, was lost as the story was placed in the (then) modern world, rather than immediately post- WWII. Also, the characters of Noelle and Larry are not explored at all beyond their affair and attempt to murder Catherine being the trigger for the story's events.

It is in the foothills of the Sierra Pelona Mountains, northwest of Palmdale and north of the Santa Clarita Valley, in the Angeles National Forest. It is on the sag pond waters of Lake Hughes and Elizabeth Lake. The community is rural in character, with a population of 649 in 2010, but also has a strong recreational element centered on the three lakes in the vicinity. The community of Elizabeth Lake is located just east of Lake Hughes, sharing the same ZIP code. History Nearby Elizabeth Lake, known then as La Laguna de Chico Lopez, was a watering locale on Spanish colonial and Mexican El Camino Viejo in Alta California and the Gold Rush era Stockton ‚Äì Los Angeles Road. From 1858 to 1861, Lake Hughes was on the route of the Butterfield Overland Mail, between the Widow Smith's Station and Mud Spring stage stops. The lake area was to the west of Rancho La Liebre, an 1846 Mexican land grant now part of Tejon Ranch. Lake Hughes was named for Judge Griffith (Patrick) Hughes, who homesteaded the area around the turn of the 20th century.\\"Looking Back - Lake Hughes Being Rescued From Pollution,\\" Daily News of Los Angeles (CA), February 25, 1989. Author: Patricia Farrell Aidem Daily News Staff Writer. Settlers were drawn to the area because water was more plentiful than in the drier Antelope Valley. In 1907 William Mulholland, superintendent of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, started work on the Elizabeth Lake Tunnel for transporting water in the Los Angeles Aqueduct from Owens Valley to Los Angeles. Less than a half a mile east of Lake Hughes, the five- mile-long (8 km) tunnel is under the valley floor. The tunnel was driven from both ends. The north portal is at Fairmont Reservoir and the south in Bear Canyon (now Portal Canyon) just off of Green Valley. This 11-foot-wide (3.4 m) tunnel was driven through solid rock and met in the center within 1¬Ω inches (3.8 cm) in line and ‚Öù inches (1.6 cm) in depth. Work was around the clock and averaged about per day. The Elizabeth Lake Tunnel was the largest single construction project on the Los Angeles Aqueduct and set speed records in its day. C.A. Austin promoted Lake Hughes as a summer resort in 1924, as a \\"fine mountain resort on the edge of Antelope Valley.\\"\\"Fine Mountain Resort On The Edge Of Antelope Valley,\\" Antelope Valley Ledger-Gazette (CA),\\" December 18, 1925 The 2020 Lake fire was also first reported here Geography Lake Hughes is generally centered on the intersection of Elizabeth Lake Road and Lake Hughes Road, both of which are county highways. Hughes Lake and Munz Lakes are located within the community. In addition, a third lake, Lake Elizabeth is located just to the east within the community of Elizabeth Lake. Lakes Hughes and Lake Elizabeth are in the canyons along the San Andreas Fault. Both lakes periodically dry up depending on rainfall cycles. Lake Hughes was previously known as West Elizabeth Lake. Government and associations Rock Inn, Lake Hughes. A notable water hole since 1929. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department (LASD) operates the Palmdale Station in Palmdale, serving Lake Hughes. Lake Hughes has its own community town council, The Lakes Town Council, which meets twice a month at the Lakes Community Center. The council helps plan community events (such as the yearly 49ers day festival and parade), hosts socials and mixers, and works with Los Angeles County officials on community planning and community standards. There are many clubs and associations within the Lake Hughes and Elizabeth Lake area. The most prominent is the Ranch Club, the town's country club and golf course. It has been open for over 60 years. The clubhouse incorporates the historic Frakes homestead of Samuel H. T. Frakes and Almeda Mudgett Frakes which was once a way station along the old stagecoach route. Others include the Lakes Women's Club, The Go for Fun Club, Lakes And Valleys Conservancy Group, Lakes & Valleys Art Guild, Fire Safe Council and the Lakes Baseball & Softball Teams.

He played in Major League Baseball as a right- handed relief pitcher from through , most notably as a member of the Cincinnati Reds dynasty that won four National League pennants and two World Series championships between 1970 and 1976. Borb√≥n was known for his durability, appearing in more games than any other pitcher in the National League between 1970 and 1978. He also played for the California Angels, San Francisco Giants and, the St. Louis Cardinals. In 2010, Borb√≥n was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame. Early life Borb√≥n was born in Santa Cruz de Mao, Dominican Republic, to Ram√≥n Jimenez and Ana Teresa Borb√≥n. He was signed as an amateur free agent by the St. Louis Cardinals organization in 1964 and two years later was drafted out of the Cardinals organization by the California Angels. Major League career Borb√≥n made his Major League debut on April 9, 1969, for the California Angels in a 7‚Äì3 home win over the Seattle Pilots. He entered the game in the fifth inning in relief of Andy Messersmith, hurling three scoreless innings with two strikeouts and allowing only two hits as he also earned his first career win. He pitched a total of 22 games for the Angels that season, with a record of 2‚Äì3 with a 6.15 earned run average. In November 1969 he was part of a five-player trade that sent him to the Cincinnati Reds. He proved to be one of the most effective and durable relievers in baseball for the Big Red Machine; he was in the top five in the National League in games pitched in six consecutive seasons from 1972 to 1977. He pitched at least 121 innings in each of those six seasons, and was part of a tandem of reliable Reds relievers along with Clay Carroll (who was with the Reds through the 1976 season). No National League pitcher appeared in more games from 1970 to 1978 than Borb√≥n. Borb√≥n and Carroll, along with relievers Wayne Granger, Will McEnaney, and Rawly Eastwick, anchored a bullpen that enabled Reds manager Sparky Anderson to change pitchers frequently, earning him the nickname \\"Captain Hook.\\" Of Borb√≥n, Reds teammate Baseball Hall of Famer Tony P√©rez said, \\"He may have been the most critical part of that great bullpen because he was such a rubber arm. He'd give two, three innings ‚Äì whatever you needed. He could pitch every night. And he wasn't intimidated by anything. I always enjoyed his company on and off the field. He was a great guy.\\" Borb√≥n also excelled in the postseason. In four National League Championship Series, he was 1‚Äì0 with a 1.26 ERA in 10 games, of which he finished seven. He was especially effective in the 1976 National League Championship Series, pitching 4 scoreless innings of relief in a three-game Reds' sweep. He also pitched well in three World Series, pitching 10 games and going 0‚Äì1 with a 3.86 ERA as the Reds were world champions in 1975 and 1976. After playing the entire decade of the 1970s with the Reds, he was traded midway through the 1979 season to the San Francisco Giants, where he pitched the remainder of the season. Shortly before the 1980 season, he was released and signed by the St. Louis Cardinals, for which he pitched ten games before he was released, signalling the end of his career. Besides being known as a very good pitcher, the licensed barber was also a colorful character. A local Cincinnati urban legend claims that Borb√≥n, incensed about being traded from the Reds in 1979, placed a voodoo losing curse on the Reds until the last member of the Reds front office management left in 1990. The Reds did, in fact, win the World Series that year (and have not played in one since). In 2002, Borb√≥n admitted that this was a hoax. Another notable story involving Borb√≥n occurred in 1973. After a bench clearing brawl, Borbon started to fight with New York Mets pitcher, Buzz Capra. Following the fracas, Borb√≥n accidentally placed a Mets hat on his head. After realizing what he had done, Borb√≥n removed the hat and ripped a piece of it off with his teeth. A year later during a nasty brawl with the Pittsburgh Pirates, Borb√≥n pinned Pirates' hurler Daryl Patterson to the turf, began pulling out clumps of his hair and bit him in the side. Patterson lost a piece of flesh in the incident and received a precautionary tetanus shot. He also bit a bouncer on the chest during an altercation at a nightclub in Cincinnati called West Side Story in Cincinnati's Monfort Heights neighborhood. Borb√≥n was referenced in a joke in the movie Airplane! As Ted Striker's inner-dialogue is heard echoing in his mind, it resembles a stadium public address announcement, and he is heard thinking \\"Pinch hitting for Pedro Borb√≥n...Manny Mota...Mota...Mota\\"This never happened in a real big-league game, as the two never actually played for the same MLB team at the same time; however Borbon and Mota did play together for the Tigres del Licey in the Domincan Winter League for several seasons. \\"He was always talking about that,\\" his son said. \\"A lot of people remember him by that. He liked that.\\" After baseball Furthering his reputation as a workhorse, even after retiring from major league baseball, he continued to pitch consistently and well in his native Dominican Republic in winter ball and in semi-pro leagues in his adopted hometown in Texas. During the Major League Baseball strike of 1994‚Äì95, Borbon was a member of the Cincinnati Reds replacement team. Borb√≥n was inducted into Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 2010. He continued to return to Cincinnati for events such as the team's annual RedsFest and for the annual Reds Legends baseball camps in Ohio in which he would sometimes team up to instruct youths with his former fellow Reds reliever Clay Carroll. Borb√≥n's son, Pedro Borb√≥n, Jr. (born in 1967), pitched in the majors for nine seasons (1992‚Äì2003) for four teams. Borb√≥n died of cancer at age 65 on June 4, 2012 at his home in Pharr, Texas. He was cremated, and there was no memorial service. He was survived by his wife Maria Borbon; son Pedro Francisco Borb√≥n; two daughters Gabriela Michelle Borb√≥n and Maria Jacqueline Borb√≥n married to Major League Baseball Player outfielder Carlos Peguero; Five grandsons Anthony Romeo Borb√≥n, Pedro D. Borb√≥n, Lennox Ezequiel Peguero, Robert Tiger Sanchez, Carlos Optimus Peguero; Two granddaughters Katelyn Borb√≥n, Chlo√© Juliette Sanchez, two brothers Porfirio and Rafael Borb√≥n; and a sister Maria de Jesus Borb√≥n.

It was included as the seventh song on the second side of their third studio album Double Nickels on the Dime (1984). The song was composed by lead singer and guitarist D. Boon and produced by Ethan James. Its minimalist composition harbors elements of neo-norte√±o and polka. The song derives its title from Corona Extra, a brand of Mexican beer. Lyrically, \\"Corona\\" is a Latino-inspired protest song that contains politically charged lines. It subsequently became famous as the theme song for the MTV reality television series Jackass. Background Named after a bottle of Mexican beer, \\"Corona\\" is a protest song. The song was inspired by a day trip the band members (Boon, bassist Mike Watt, and drummer George Hurley) had taken to Mexico on the Fourth of July, 1982. (The same trip also inspired the Mike Watt composition \\"I Felt Like A Gringo\\" on Buzz or Howl Under the Influence of Heat.) Moved by some of the more downtrodden elements of the area that he had seen, Boon set about writing a song in sympathy with the people of Mexico. Recording Towards the end of their career, Minutemen started to musically branch out with their songs. In contrast to atypical hardcore punk tempos, the band experiments with Nortena sounds built on polka rhythms for \\"Corona.\\" Drawing from post-punk alongside more eclectic musical influences, their music is an interaction between Hurley's virtuosic drumming, Boon's trebly electric guitar, and Watt's busy bass guitar playing. Regarding their songwriting, Watt claimed, \\"We don't write songs, we write rivers.\\" Composition \\"Corona\\" is an uptempo hardcore punk and neo-Nortena song that runs for a duration of two minutes and twenty-five seconds. It features driving guitar riffs, burly yet funky bassline and frantic drumbeats. The song opens with an introduction, where a twanging guitar riff is played. Its minimalist arrangement contains no choruses, and is instead composed of fifty- three words structured into three stanzas. Lyrically, \\"Corona\\" is a Latino protest song which contains political lines. It is an elegiac complaint regarding the injustice and destructive greed of the United States. Lead singer-guitarist D Boon closes by singing about a bottle of Mexican beer. The bottle is intended for a poor woman on a beach in Mexico due to a five cent deposit. Critical reception In his review of their album, Juan Gutierrez from LA Weekly wrote, \\"Minutemen's song 'Corona' finally broke big due to Jackass, but it was D. Boon's political lyrics, driving guitar riffs, and George Hurley's frantic drumming that make Double Nickels on the Dime hardcore perfection. Billboard's Michael Azerrad's described the song as an \\"ocean of scrabbling avant-funk, Norte√±o two-step.\\" Commercial performance In March 2020, \\"Corona\\" was among countless previously released songs with titles and lyrical themes about the world ending or human survival which prompted a rise in sales and streaming. This increase occurred as populations adjusted to life in self-quarantine during the worldwide coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The gains \\"Corona\\" experienced included a 70% rise in digital song sales and a 26% increase in total on-demand U.S. streams to 63,000. The following week, \\"Corona\\" rose 95% up in U.S. streams to 122,000 for the tracking week ending March 19. Additionally, the song also re-entered LyricFind's U.S. ranking at number 9 for the tracking week running March 9‚Äì15. The chart ranks fastest momentum-gaining tracks in lyric-search queries and usages in the United States and globally as provided by LyricFind. Legacy In the 2000s, \\"Corona\\" became world-famous as the theme song of the MTV reality television series Jackass. The song was immortalized on the stunt show, which used its trademark opening guitar riff. In the series, adolescent California skateboarders subject themselves to life-threatening tests of courage and self-harm. Canadian singer-songwriter Ford Pier claimed the songwriting approach for \\"Great Western\\" from his debut studio album Meconium was inspired by \\"Corona.\\" He stated, \\"I had a desire to try to write a song in that style favoured by your journeyman singer-songwriters of pseudo-literary inclination where an ancillary detail or object within the narrative is selected to be the symbolic fulcrum of the whole thing. ... 'Corona' by the Minutemen would have been a touchstone in this approach.\\" Cover versions Arizona indie rock band Calexico performed a cover of \\"Corona\\" during a concert at Newport Folk Festival in Newport, Rhode Island. Their cover version was included on the playlist COVID Quarantine Dance Party by Lo Bradley. \\"Corona\\" was among many popular songs found in most quarantine-themed playlists. *An early version of the song, as performed by the band on a live video shot by Flipside magazine in 1983, for some reason has the deposit on the bottle being ten cents, not five. *A solo version of the song by D. Boon can be heard on the CD D. Boon and Friends, released in 2003. *The indie rock band Calexico covered \\"Corona,\\" with mariachi horns, on their 2004 EP Convict Pool. *The song has also been covered by the Yonder Mountain String Band and is featured on their live album Mountain Tracks: Volume 4.

While frequently considered to be a military facility, these can be used in many other cases by governments or businesses. The term \\"war room\\" is also often used in politics to refer to teams of communications people who monitor and listen to the media and the public, respond to inquiries, and synthesize opinions to determine the best course of action. If all functions of a command center are located in a single room this is often referred to as a control room. A command center enables an organization to function as designed, to perform day-to-day operations regardless of what is happening around it, in a manner in which no one realizes it is there but everyone knows who is in charge when there is trouble. Conceptually, a command center is a source of leadership and guidance to ensure that service and order is maintained, rather than an information center or help desk. Its tasks are achieved by monitoring the environment and reacting to events, from the relatively harmless to a major crisis, using predefined procedures. Types of command centers There are many types of command centers. They include: ; Data center management: Oversees the central management and operating control for the computer systems that are essential most businesses, usually housed in data centers and large computer rooms. ; Business application management: Ensures applications that are critical to customers and businesses are always available and working as designed. ; Civil management: Oversees the central management and control of civil operational functions. Staff members in those centers monitor the metropolitan environment to ensure the safety of people and the proper operation of critical government services, adjusting services as required and ensuring proper constant movement. ; Emergency (crisis) management: Directs people, resources, and information, and controls events to avert a crisis/emergency and minimize/avoid impacts should an incident occur. 19th century War Room of the United States Navy =Types of command and control rooms and their responsibilities= * Command Center (CC or ICC) ** Data center, computer system, incident response * Network Operation Centers (NOC) ** Network equipment and activity * Tactical Operation Centers (TOC) ** Military operations ** Police and intelligence * Security Operation Centers (SOC) ** Security agencies ** Government agencies ** Traffic management ** CCTV * Emergency Operation Centers (EOC) ** Emergency services * Combined Operation Centers (COS) ** Air traffic control ** Oil and gas ** Control rooms ** Broadcast * Audio Visual (AV) ** Simulation and training ** Medical * Social Media Command Center ** Monitoring, posting and responding on social media sites Military and government A command center is a central place for carrying out orders and for supervising tasks, also known as a headquarters, or HQ. Common to every command center are three general activities: inputs, processes, and outputs. The inbound aspect is communications (usually intelligence and other field reports). Inbound elements are \\"sitreps\\" (situation reports of what is happening) and \\"progreps\\" (progress reports relative to a goal that has been set) from the field back to the command element. The process aspect involves a command element that makes decisions about what should be done about the input data. In the US military, the command consists of a field ‚Äì (Major to Colonel) or flag ‚Äì (General) grade commissioned officer with one or more advisers. The outbound communications then delivers command decisions (i.e., operating orders) to the field elements. Command centers should not be confused with the high-level military formation of a Command ‚Äì as with any formation, Commands may be controlled from a command center, however not all formations controlled from a command centre are Commands. =Examples=Canada During the Cold War, the Government of Canada undertook the construction of \\"Emergency Government Headquarters\\", to be used in the event of nuclear warfare or other large-scale disaster. Canada was generally allied with the United States for the duration of the war, was a founding member of NATO, allowed American cruise missiles to be tested in the far north, and flew sovereignty missions in the Arctic. For these reasons, the country was often seen as being a potential target of the Soviets at the height of nuclear tensions in the 1960s. Extensive post-attack plans were drawn up for use in emergencies, and fallout shelters were built all across the country for use as command centres for governments of all levels, the Canadian Forces, and rescue personnel, such as fire services. Different levels of command centres included: * CEGF, Central Emergency Government Facility, located in Carp, Ontario, near the National Capital Region. Designed for use by senior federal politicians and civil servants. * REGHQ, Regional Emergency Government Headquarters, of which there were seven, spread out across the country. * MEGHQ, Municipal Emergency Government Headquarters * ZEGHQ, Zone Emergency Government Headquarters, built within the basements of existing buildings, generally designed to hold around 70 staff. * RU, Relocation Unit, or CRU, Central Relocation Unit. Often bunkers built as redundant backups to REGHQs and MEGHQs were given the RU designation. Serbia Joint Operations Command (JOC) is the organizational unit of the Serbian Armed Forces directly subordinated to the General Staff of the Armed Forces. The main duty of the Command is to conduct operational command over the Armed Forces. The Operations Command has a flexible formation, which is expanded by the representatives of other organizational units of the General Staff, and, if there is a need, operational level commands. In peacetime, the commander of the Joint Operations Command is at the same time Deputy of Serbian Armed Forces General Staff. United Kingdom Constructed in 1938, the Cabinet War Rooms were used extensively by Sir Winston Churchill during the Second World War. United States NORAD Command Center at the Cheyenne Mountain Complex, Colorado A Command and Control Center is a specialized type of command center operated by a government or municipal agency 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Various branches of the U.S. Military such as the U.S Coast Guard and the U.S. Navy have command and control centers. They are also common in many large correctional facilities. A Command and Control Center operates as the agency's dispatch center, surveillance monitoring center, coordination office, and alarm monitoring center all in one. Command and control centers are not staffed by high-level officials but rather by highly skilled technical staff. When a serious incident occurs the staff will notify the agency's higher level officials. In service businesses A command center enables the real-time visibility and management of an entire service operation. Similar to an air traffic control center, a command center allows organizations to view the status of global service calls, service technicians, and service parts on a single screen. In addition, customer commitments or service level agreements (SLAs) that have been made can also be programmed into the command center and monitored to ensure all are met and customers are satisfied. A command center is well suited for industries where coordinating field service (people, equipment, parts, and tools) is critical. Some examples: *Intel's security Command Center *Dell's Enterprise Command Center *NASA's Mission Control Houston Command Center for Space Shuttle and ISS War rooms can also be used for defining strategies, or driving business intelligence efforts. In popular culture Model of the war room constructed for Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove. The most famous war room in popular culture was the one depicted in the 1964 film Dr. Strangelove. War rooms were also seen in other films like Fail Safe and WarGames. A command center is used as the headquarters of the Power Rangers in the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers television series. Command centers are used in the game Command and Conquer: Generals to train Workers and Dozers, provide vision, and command special weapons.

History Dover Heights is believed to have been named for its cliffs along the Pacific Ocean which resembled those found at Dover, in Kent, England. The first mention of Dover Heights appeared in municipal records in 1886. The area was first used for market gardens. In 1830 land in the area was owned by Daniel Cooper (1785‚Äì1853), a partner in the firm Cooper and Levey, who owned the Waterloo Stores. The retailing emporium was located on the corner of George Street and Market Street in the city, on the site that was later occupied by Gowings Brothers retailers until 2006. The Dover Heights area was subdivided in 1913. Population At the 2016 census, there were 3,802 residents in Dover Heights. 53.7% of people were born in Australia.

The CSIRO further used the site for pioneering experimentation in radio astronomy related to galactic radio emissions, with a team including John Gatenby Bolton first observing solar emissions in 1945. The site primarily made use of Yagi antennas. The first radio source they identified with something that could be seen was in the constellation Taurus, and named Taurus A, which is in fact the Crab Nebula, a supernova remnant (the remains of an exploding star) first reported by Chinese astronomers in the year 1054.

Dundas Valley is located 21 kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of the City of Parramatta. Dundas Valley is part of the Northern Sydneyhttps://postcodez.com.au/postcodes.cgi?search_suburb=Dundas+valley&search;_state=nsw&type;=search and Greater Western Sydney https://www.wslhd.health.nsw.gov.au/Mental-Health- Services/Our-Services regions. The valley has been shaped by the Ponds Creek, around which many of the area's parks are located. The valley is bounded by both steep and gentle slopes feeding into the creek. The Ponds walk is a marked 6.6 kilometre track which follows the Ponds and Subiaco Creeks from Eric Mobbs Memorial Park in Carlingford to Jim Crowgey Reserve in Rydalmere. This walk follows a number of the parks in the Dundas Valley area. History Dundas and surrounding areas were originally known as \\"The Ponds\\", a name still reflected in The Ponds Creek. The first private land grants in Sydney made in 1791 were in what is now North East Dundas and adjoining Dundas Valley and Ermington. This consisted of land grants to 14 former convicts and their families along the Ponds and Subiaco Creeks. The city of Parramatta has erected signs in the suburb documenting the initial land grants in the area. One subsequent grant was the 30 acre Lot 108 to John Love, a member of the NSW Corps, on 20 February 1794. In the early 1800s a number of the early settlers sold their grants to Lieutenant William Cox of the NSW Corps. Cox's holdings spread from Brush Farm into Dundas Valley where he grazed sheep and cattle and grew corn and wheat. Gregory Blaxland purchased Brush Farm in 1806. Lieutenant William Cox would refer the south eastern corner near Brush farm now bordering Deninstone West and Eastwood as Dundas Heights; Lieutenant William Cox would survey his land from the vantage point of Dundas Heights. The name Dundas was first used in the area in 1799, taken from a parish of the same name in England, although it is also claimed the area was initially named after Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville. The area was developed during the 1950s and 1960s with the construction of public housing. Dundas Valley was formally declared a suburb on 19 October 2007. Thomas Mitchell opened a quarry in 1832 on the site of the park that now bears his name. The quarry was a supplier of ‚Äòblue metal‚Äô, used in road construction, into the 20th century. The 'blue metal' was quarried by convicts and carried to Ermington Wharf where it was ferried to Sydney. The quarry exposed a large volcanic formation between 200 and 250 million years old. Due to the geological significance of the area, it was visited by a number of famous scientists, including Charles Darwin and Douglas Mawson. A number of streets in Dundas Valley are named after ships of the First Fleet (Sirius, Supply, Alexander, Charlotte and Friendship) and the Second Fleet (Neptune). Population At the 2016 census, there were 5,412 residents in Dundas Valley. 49.9% of people were born in Australia. The most common countries of birth were China 13.0%, South Korea 6.9% and Hong Kong 2.7%. In Dundas Valley 46.4% of people only spoke English at home.

The trail is considered highly accessible, scenic, and remarkably rural despite its proximity to urban Boston. The trail includes the summits of Mount Wachusett and Mount Watatic, as well as many interesting geologic, historic, and natural features.The Midstate Trail Guide, 5th edition (2006). Worcester, Massachusetts:The Midstate Trail Committee. Trail description Agrarian view along the Midstate Trail in Sutton, Massachusetts The northern terminus of the Midstate Trail is located on the New Hampshire border on the Ashburnham/ Ashby, Massachusetts town line just north of the summit of Mount Watatic; the southern terminus is located on the Rhode Island border in Douglas, Massachusetts in Douglas State Forest. In Ashburnham, the Midstate Trail meets the Wapack Trail, which runs north into New Hampshire for an additional . Where the Midstate Trail terminates on the Rhode Island border, the North-South Trail continues south to the Atlantic Ocean. The Southern New England Trunkline Trail, a converted rail trail, intersects the Midstate Trail in Douglas, Massachusetts, and there is a significant network of interconnecting shorter trails on Mount Wachusett and in the Ware River Watershed area maintained by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation, the Worcester Chapter of the Appalachian Mountain Club, and the nonprofit organization Wachusett Greenways.Massachusetts and Rhode Island Trail Guide (1989). Boston: Appalachian Mountain Club. The Midstate Trail corridor includes woodland, lake shores, ledges, swamp borders, small mountains, agricultural land, meadows, brooks, as well as a few classic New England hamlet commons. Suburban areas abut the trail in places. The highest point on the Midstate Trail is the 2006-foot (611m) summit of Mount Wachusett from which the Boston skyline, away, is visible in clear weather. The cliffs of Mount Watatic and the Crow Hills are considered particularly scenic. The damp woodlands throughout the trail corridor are scattered with stone walls, a reminder that the forest was farmland in the 19th century. Common on the trail are huge boulders, several of them balanced in unlikely positions, called glacial erratics; two noteworthy examples are Balance Rock on Mount Wachusett and Samson's Pebble in Oakham, Massachusetts.Cronin, William. Changes in the Land: Indians, Colonists, and the Ecology of New England (2003). New York: Hill and Wang. Notable features that are on or are easily accessible from the trail route include Wallum Lake, the French River (Massachusetts), Hodges Village Dam, Buffumville Lake and dam, the historic Ryder Tavern, Moose Hill, Sampson's Pebble, the ruins of an early 20th-century work camp for prisoners with tuberculosis, Barre Falls Dam, the Massachusetts Audubon Society's Wachusett Meadows and Burncoat Pond sanctuaries, Mount Wachusett (the most prominent peak in eastern Massachusetts), the Crow Hills (a popular rock climbing destination), Muddy Pond (an attractive, remote, and undeveloped glacial pond), and Mount Watatic, the southernmost prominent summit in the Wapack Range of mountains (sometimes referred to as the Pack Monadnock Range). Although the trail is most often used for hiking and occasionally snowshoeing and backpacking, portions of it are suitable for, and are used for, mountain biking and cross country skiing. Site-specific activities such as downhill skiing (on Mount Wachusett), horseback riding, swimming, fishing, hunting, rock climbing, bouldering, and disc golf (there are courses at Buffumville Dam and Barre Falls Dam) are enjoyed on the trail corridor as well.Department of Conservation and Recreation (Massachusetts). Retrieved November 20, 2007.United States Army Corps of Engineers. Retrieved December 7, 2007 =Trail communities= The Midstate Trail passes through land in the following incorporated towns: Douglas, Sutton, Oxford, Charlton, Spencer, Leicester, Oakham, Rutland, Barre, Hubbardston, Princeton, Westminster, Ashburnham, and Ashby. History In the 1920s, a trail was blazed from Mount Watatic to Mount Wachusett, but it fell into disuse. In 1972, the Worcester County Commissioners proposed a trail that would recreate the abandoned route and extend the trail through the length of Worcester County. The trail was created primarily through the efforts of local volunteers. The Appalachian Mountain Club was heavily involved in the process and remains involved today. A summit hotel on Mount Wachusett, which operated in the 19th and early 20th centuries (eventually succumbing to fire and dynamic changes in tourism), encouraged trail building on the mountain well before the Midstate Trail was created. The Midstate Trail incorporated some of these footways into its route. Other sections of the trail route follow old town roads and farm roads abandoned during the agrarian shift to the midwestern United States in the late 19th century.Massachusetts Online Mapping. Various shapefiles. Retrieved November 19, 2007. Landscape, geology, and environment Wallum Lake is located just off the Midstate Trail in Douglas, Massachusetts.Southern portions of the Midstate Trail traverse a terrain marked by rock outcrops and ledges of gneiss and schist, and occasionally granite. Central portions of the trail climb the flanks and summits of drumlins such as Moose Hill and Buck Hill in Spencer, Massachusetts. Northern portions of the trail (especially Mount Watatic) follow mountainous ridges of 400 million year old, heavily metamorphized schist and quartzite identified as the Littleton Formation. Evidence of recent glacial activity can be found throughout all parts of the Midstate Trail. Such evidence includes glacial erratics, glacial scouring, glacial striations, deranged drainage, highland swamps, and roches moutonn√©es, so called \\"sheepback mountains\\" because they often resemble the shape of a sheep in profile. The extremely steep south and/or east faces of these hills were carved by the movement of glacial ice down lee slopes.Raymo, Chet and Raymo, Maureen E. Written in Stone: A Geologic History of the Northeastern United States (1989). Chester, Connecticut: Globe Pequot. The trail route generally follows a highland watershed divide that separates the drainage of four river systems: the Blackstone River (southeast); the Nashua River, which is part of the Merrimack River watershed (northeast); the Ware River and Millers River watersheds which are absorbed by the Connecticut River watershed (west); and the French River in Oxford, Massachusetts, which is part of the south flowing Quinebaug River watershed. Major flood control projects are visible from the trail and have significantly altered the landscape via damming, the elimination of ecosystems subject to periodic flooding, and the creation of large bodies of water. These include the Hodges Village Dam and the Buffumville Lake projects in the French River drainage and the Barre Falls Dam project on the Ware River in Barre, Massachusetts. These projects are managed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Much of the forest the trail passes through is regrowth. The original woodlands were cleared to make room for farms in the early 18th century. Old stone walls and crumbling cellar holes are common evidence of the region's agrarian past. When farming interests moved west in the 19th century, the land reverted to forest. Much of these new forests were in turn successively re-harvested for building materials or firewood3. Forests along the trail are in various stages of re- growth, where they have not been cleared to make room for the ever-increasing suburban development. Notable old growth stands (such as the one on Mount Wachusett‚Äîwhich became a magnet for heated controversy after a 2003 court ruling allowing a ski area expansion under state lease; see (#Protecting the trail corridor below)) are rare on the trail route. Douglas State Forest, near the southern end of the trail, supports an original Atlantic white cedar swamp, although the trees are not considered old growth cedars. Forest ecology types include the oak-hickory forest at lower elevations and the northern hardwood forest at higher elevations. Common species include American beech and yellow birch at higher elevations and on north facing slopes. Eastern hemlock is common in damp, shaded ravines. Red, white, and black oak, sugar maple, and ash are prolific throughout, including frequent very old individual specimens often called wolf trees. Solid stands of eastern white pine are common while pitch pine can be found scattered on dry ledges. Monoculture tree plantations of both native and non-native species can be found along the trail as well. The forest understory supports mountain laurel, witch-hazel, wintergreen, hobblebush, partridgeberry, as well as a variety of herbs, ferns and mosses. Multiflora rose, oriental bittersweet, purple loosestrife, and phragmites are well-established invasive species along the trail.Kricher, John. A Field Guide to Eastern Forests (1998). Boston: Houghton-Mifflin. Abandoned farms and currently functional farms, hay fields, pastures, and orchards are also apparent landscape features on the trail. Hiking the trail The Midstate Trail passes through the cow tunnel ( high; rebuilt in 2005) under U.S. Route 20. The Midstate Trail is blazed with yellow triangles. The trail is regarded as easy hiking, with occasional steep and rugged sections. Most of the route is no more than a mile or two (as the crow flies) from a public road. Potential hazards and annoyances along the Midstate Trail include biting and stinging insects and poison ivy. Lyme disease, borne by deer ticks, has become an increasing problem throughout southern New England since the 1990s.Massachusetts DPH. Cited Dec. 6, 2007. Venomous snakes are considered nearly (perhaps totally) extinct in Worcester County. The trail does pass through black bear habitat, although problems with bears are extremely rare (though not unheard of). Skunks, porcupines, and raccoons are common during the evening. Because some of the water sources flow through populated areas or farms, water sources along the trail may be unfit to drink. Weather along the trail is typical of Massachusetts; however, conditions on exposed hilltops and mountaintops can be much harsher in bad weather. In the winter and early spring, ice is a common danger on steep slopes and ledges, sometimes making portions of the trail unhikeable without special equipment. Deep snow in the winter may necessitate snowshoes or skis. Snow and ice may cling to parts of Mount Wachusett and Mount Watatic longer than it does in the surrounding area. Lightning can be a hazard on exposed peaks and hilltops during summer thunderstorms.NOAA Several primitive lean-tos and campsites are available along the route; however, camping is prohibited in most areas and amenities are lacking.

Like other towns in the Vulture area, Maschito was repopulated by Albanian refugees after the occupation of Albania by the Ottoman Empire. Geography Located Northeast of Basilicata, it is a small town covering a hill named Mustaf√†, about above sea level. It is bounded by the comuni (Municipalities), of Forenza, Ginestra, Palazzo San Gervasio, Venosa. Maschito has a typical Mediterranean climate with slight mountain characteristics, because of its distance from the sea. History Maschito was founded in 1467 by King Ferdinand I of Naples, when the Albanian hero Skanderbeg was sent with numerous troops to fight the Angevin pretenders to the throne of Naples and the Barons. The capture of Kruja by the Turks and the abandonment of Shkod√´r (1478‚Äì79) led to the first migration of Albanians (Arb√´resh√´) to Basilicata. In 1533, when the Fortress of Koroni fell the Albanian refugees of the area were allowed to settle areas of the Kingdom of Naples, including Maschito. At that time the territory of Maschito belonged to the Bishop of Venosa and the Prior of Gerosolmitano of Bari. By law, around November 17, 1539, the Notary Giacomo Citamiore of Venosa, and the Spanish viceroy of Naples, Pedro √Ålvarez de Toledo, ceded the aforementioned territory to Giovanni de Icis. The Albanians were obligated to pay one ducat a year from the annual income of each household, and 200 ducats extra a year if the number of homes increased by one. Economy The economy is based on agriculture, especially grapes and olives.

It is the oldest and largest organization led by blind people in the United States. Its national headquarters are in Baltimore, Maryland. Overview Anyone, blind or sighted, is permitted to join the NFB, but a majority of members in its local chapters, state affiliates, and nationwide divisions must be blind, as must its officers and board members at every level with exception of the National Organization of Parents of Blind Children. This structure is intended to ensure that the organization is run by blind people and reflects the collective views of its blind members, the NFB refers to itself as \\"the voice of the nation's blind.\\" The philosophy of the organization is; The organization's former President, Dr. Kenneth Jernigan, said, \\"We who are blind are pretty much like you. We have our share of both geniuses and jerks, but most of us somewhere between, ordinary people living ordinary lives.\\" The NFB works to promulgate its philosophy by educating and recruiting new members, working to educate the general public, and interacting with legislators and policy makers at the local, state, and national levels. The positions of the National Federation of the Blind on issues are determined by its national convention, which meets annually and typically has between 2,500 and 3,000 delegates from the organization's affiliates in the fifty states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.https://www.nfb.org/get- involved/national-convention/first-timers-guide The policy positions of the NFB take the form of resolutions, which are voted upon by the convention. Like a union, the convention is subsidized by the organization making it affordable to those attending. The agenda of the National Convention is published on-line prior to its convention. Its logo is called the whosit and consists of an outline of a walking person with a white cane. The NFB-style white cane is longer than most in order to allow the blind person to use a more natural walking position with their arms at their sides, rather than extended in front of them. The added length also allows the blind person to walk more quickly by giving more advanced information. In addition, the lighter weight of the fiberglass and carbon fiber canes, coupled with the metal tip, provides more information than the heavier aluminum style canes with plastic tips. Federation members view the long white cane as a tool of independence and self-determination, rather than one of helplessness and dependency, as it provides greater mobility to the blind. Though detractors of the National Federation of the Blind assert that the NFB is anti-guide dog, the NFB has a division dedicated to educating the public about the use of guide dogs,http://www.nagdu.org/ while promoting and fostering effective handling of guide dogs by its members. The National Association of Guide Dog Users (NAGDU) is one of the largest and fastest-growing divisions of the Federation. Organizational history The National Federation of the Blind headquarters and Jernigan Institute in Baltimore, Maryland In 1940 sixteen people met in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, to develop a constitution that would unite organizations of blind people in seven states (California, Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin) in a national federation that would serve as a vehicle for collective action to improve the prospects of the nation's blind citizens. The founder and president of the NFB for its first twenty years was Dr. Jacobus tenBroek, a professor, lawyer and constitutional scholar. The NFB's first logo was a circle with the words \\"Security, Equality, and Opportunity\\" forming a triangle at the center of the circle. This expressed the pressing needs and demands of the fledgling organization. TenBroek led early battles to obtain a modest stipend for blind people so they could live independently (security), equal access to jobs in the Civil Service and elsewhere where blind candidates had been prohibited from applying (opportunity), and equal access to housing, transportation, and places of public accommodation (equality). Because of pressure exerted from within and differences of opinion about whether the organization should be a loose confederacy of strong state affiliates or a unified federal structure with state affiliates and local chapters (which is the way the current federation is organized), the NFB split into two groups in 1961. Those who left the NFB united to form the American Council of the Blind (ACB), an organization that continues to exist today. Jacobus tenBroek, who had served as president of the NFB for 20 years, resigned due to these problems, and was succeeded by John Taylor, who was succeeded by Russell Kletzing the following year, but tenBroek became president again in 1966. The NFB gradually replaced the handful of affiliates that had left, and by the 1970s it had regained its momentum. When Jacobus tenBroek died in 1968, he was succeeded in the presidency by Kenneth Jernigan, who served as president for most of the period until 1986 and who continued to be a blind leader, teacher, and thinker with an international reputation until his death in 1998. Marc Maurer, a young lawyer who had been mentored by Jernigan, was elected president in 1986 and served as President until 2014 when he was replaced by Mark Riccobono, who is the current president of the organization. In 1978 Jernigan led the organization in establishing its national headquarters at 1800 Johnson Street in Baltimore, Maryland. Gradually the group remodeled and occupied the four floors of a block-long building, which they named the National Center for the Blind. The NFB broke ground in October 2001 for a twenty-million-dollar research and training institute now located adjacent to the National Center. The National Federation of the Blind Jernigan Institute opened for business in January 2004. Continuing to exert its influence, the NFB has taken over Braille Transcriber Certification from the Library of Congress, will receive up to $10 million from a US coin honoring Louis Braille and works to influence state training programs for the blind to require training in the use of the white cane. PublicationsBooks= * In 1999, the NFB published Kenneth Jernigan, The Master, The Mission, The Movement, which tells of the convergence of a master teacher and the organized blind movement-of Dr. Kenneth Jernigan and the National Federation of the Blind. * In 1990 the NFB published a history of its first fifty years, : A History of the Organized Blind Movement in the United States. * In the 1990s the group published thirty small compilations of first-person articles written by blind people intended to demonstrate what it is like to be blind known as the Kernel Books. The NFB uses these Kernel Books in its public education efforts. =Magazines= The organization publishes several magazines. * Since 1957 it has produced a monthly general-interest magazine called the Braille Monitor. * Future Reflections is a quarterly magazine produced by the National Organization of Parents of Blind Children for parents and teachers. Future Reflections was established in 1981, and issues beginning in 1991 are available on the NFB's web site. * From 1998 through 2007 the National Association of Blind Students published the Student Slate, discussing topics relating to blindness and higher education. * Since one of the most frequent ramifications of diabetes is vision loss, the NFB publishes a quarterly tabloid-format magazine called Voice of the Diabetic. Membership, governing structure and subsidiary organizations The NFB's literature estimates about 50,000 active members. Membership is open to all, both blind and sighted. All officers of the organization and its affiliates must be blind, except for the leaders of the National Organization of Parents of Blind Children.Constitution of theNational Federation of the Blind (1986 revision). Article 3, Section C. The NFB has affiliates in all 50 states as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, and these affiliates are divided into local chapters. Affiliates and chapters pledge to support the national organization while carrying on independent activities in their local areas. The affiliates, chapters and the national organization periodically have elections for officers. The positions are president, first vice president, second vice president, secretary, treasurer and several board members. The NFB also has dozens of groups for people with special interests, such as the National Association of Blind Students, the National Association of Blind Lawyers, The National Association of Blind Merchants the National Association of the blind in Communities of Faith, and the National Association of Guide Dog Users, to name some of the larger groups. Some of these groups, such as the National Association of Guide Dog Users and National Association of Blind Students, also have state affiliates. Since 1945, the NFB has held a convention every year in a major American city, usually early in July. As of 2005, it is estimated that between 2,000 and 3,000 people attend these conventions. In 2002, 2003 and 2005 the convention was held at the Galt House Hotel in Louisville, Kentucky but it is highly unusual for the conventions to be held so often in a particular city. The 2006 convention was held in Dallas, Texas, and the 2007 convention was held in Atlanta, Georgia. At the 2007 convention, on the morning of July 3, over 1000 NFB members marched two miles from the Marriott Marquis Hotel to the Olympic Park in what was known as the March for Independence. It was led by Congressman John Lewis. The March for Independence was held again the following year in Dallas, Texas. Money raised from the march went to the Imagination fund, which will support NFB programs and grants. Each state has its own affiliate convention sometime during the year. At the national convention, which lasts a week, there are presentations about the struggles and triumphs of blind people, and the availability of technology for blind people has been a common topic. The special interest groups have meetings at the convention during which they elect their officers, and the president gives his presidential report. The presidential report describes the actions taken by the national headquarters during the last year. The president also gives a speech at the banquet, in which he takes a more philosophical approach focusing on the nature of blindness as a characteristic. The national convention has elections for officers and board members, in which the selections of the nominating committee have been elected unanimously in recent years, and the convention passes resolutions about the policies of the organization, which often provokes some debate. The state conventions, which usually last two to three days, also have resolutions and elections, which are often more contentious than at the national level. Scholarships The NFB awards scholarships to 30 blind college students each year in recognition of achievement by blind scholars. Rehabilitation NFB provides blindness training at sites in the United States which require a residency of about 12 to 14 months. Spouses and children of the blind are not permitted to live with the blind student during this time of intense training. Family involvement in rehabilitation is limited and discouraged. The NFB has developed and requires the students in its rehabilitation programs to use only their own line of lightweight long white non-folding canes. The purported purpose is to enhance effective travel coupled with the use of dark sleep shades for total occlusion during the intense year long training schedule. The object of simulating total blindness according to various articles and opinions published in the Braille Monitor (an NFB Publication) is to prepare the student for such a time when they might become totally blind. Some medical professionals hold the opinion that such total occlusion practice actually exacerbates the deterioration of sight in those who might still have a remainder of limited or partial sight. The NFB has always stressed that the blind citizen is to be taught to travel, not simply by memorizing specific routes, but by practicing going to unfamiliar places using the long cane and even wearing blindfolds, called sleep shades, if they have any residual vision. The NFB contends that students who have been trained using this method become confident, independent travelers who don't need to return for more training if they lose more sight. Though the NFB supports the use of guide dogs (and some of its members use them) the NFB believes that all blind people should know how to use canes and in practice strongly discourages the use of guide dogs as a sign of weakness and a lack of independence in the user of this tool. The NFB advocates teaching Braille to both children and adults who cannot read print efficiently and comfortably. This position has provoked opposition from some agencies and school districts who believe that only children who are totally or almost totally blind should need to learn Braille. According to the National Center for Health Statistics National Health Interview Survey, the United States 94,000 legally blind school-age children. Of these only about 5,500 are being taught Braille. Some of these students can read print effectively; some are multiply impaired and cannot learn to read at all; but the NFB believes that many more than the six percent of the blind children currently learning to read Braille could be taught to read if parents and educators were committed to doing so. An even smaller percentage of adults losing vision are encouraged to learn Braille. The NFB maintains that these adults are functionally illiterate when they are no longer able to read print effectively and Braille instruction has not been made available to them. Some graduates of NFB rehabilitation programs report that after losing their sight in mid-life they were discouraged by those who never experienced sight not to continue visualizing their surroundings or loved ones despite medical opinions to the contrary. In the mid 1980s the NFB established three adult training centers: the Louisiana Center for the Blind (Ruston, Louisiana) the Colorado Center for the Blind (Littleton, Colorado), and Blindness Learning in New Dimensions (BLIND), Inc., (Minneapolis, Minnesota). These facilities have now trained hundreds of blind adults to travel, read Braille, use computers with screen- access programs, cook, and use power tools. These centers also have summer programs for teenagers. The training centers are largely staffed by blind people. Technology In 1977 the NFB directed the final field trials of the first reading machine, developed by Ray Kurzweil. The machine weighed 80 pounds and cost $50,000. The machine used 50 bits per word and could store 750,000 bits of information. It used a camera to scan 15 characters per second and was programmed with the rules that govern spoken English. From this it produced the word with a synthetic voice. NFB has partnered with Kurzweil Educational Systems, a company founded by noted inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil, to develop a completely portable reading machine: the Kurzweil- National Federation of the Blind Reader. A digital camera takes a picture of the printed material to be read, and an attached personal digital assistant (PDA) reads the text aloud. The text is also stored as a text file, which can be saved and moved to a computer or portable notetaker so that it can be sent to a Braille embosser (sometimes called a Braille printer) or read on a paperless Braille display. Outside the United States The NFB is a participant in the World Blind Union and maintains relationships with groups of blind people in other countries. In the UK, there is a similar organization known as the National Federation of the Blind of the United Kingdom. See also *National Federation of the Blind v.

He was the son of Baha' al-Dawla. Biography Abu Shuja lived in Baghdad during his youth. Shortly before Baha' al-Dawla's death, he named Abu Shuja as his successor. Upon succeeding his father, he took the title Sultan al-Dawla wa 'Izz al-Milla (\\"Power of the Dynasty and Glory of the Community\\"). Travelling to his father's capital in Shiraz, he did seek for the traditional investiture by the Abbasid caliph, but instead had the required materials sent to him. He entrusted his oldest brothers Jalal al-Dawla and Qawam al-Dawla with the governorships of Basra and Kerman, respectively. He stayed in Persia for a long time; when he returned to Iraq three years later, he only went to Ahvaz to meet with his governor. In 1018 Sultan al-Dawla again came to Iraq, in an attempt to maintain friendly terms with the neighboring Amirate of Mosul. Qawam al-Dawla, taking advantage of his brother's presence in the west, invaded Fars with the support of the Ghaznavids. The attack failed, Qawam al-Dawla's marked the division of the Buyid state. After repulsing Qawam al-Dawla's attack, Sultan al-Dawla returned to Iraq in order to solidify his rule there. The marchlands of the region, which had long resisted Buyid authority, were finally subjugated. The Turkish mercenaries, however, became discontented over the presence Sultan al-Dawla's Daylamite troops. They therefore raised a brother of the amir, Musharrif al- Dawla, as their ruler in 1021. After a long series of negotiations, Sultan al- Dawla recognized his brother as \\"King of Iraq\\", in exchange for the latter's submission as a vassal. Sultan al-Dawla, however, wanted to retain direct rule over the region, and he invaded with his army. His defeat by Musharrif al- Dawla's forces put an end to this plan, and Iraq became fully independent. The concept of the senior amir temporarily died; each region of the Buyid state was now ruled independently of one another. Having overseen the fragmentation of the Buyids, Sultan al-Dawla died in Shiraz in December 1024. He was succeeded in Fars by his son Abu Kalijar.

Biography Ibarra was born in Lomas de Zamora, a district located in the southern region of Greater Buenos Aires. His father was a Paraguayan member of the PLRA who left his country during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner. He enrolled at the Instituto Libre de Segunda Ense√±anza, a public college preparatory school, and earned a law degree at the University of Buenos Aires. He worked as a prosecutor in the Judiciary, but resigned this job to participate in politics with as co-founder in 1990 of center-left party: the Frente Grande. His opposition to the pardons granted by President Carlos Menem to leaders of the 1976-83 dictatorship convicted in the 1985 Trial of the Juntas led to Ibarra's dismissal as prosecutor in 1991 by Solicitor General Oscar Roger. He was elected, however, to the Buenos Aires Deliberative Council that September, and in 1993 was named President of the Council. He was later elected as a member of the convention that oversaw the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution. Ibarra became a leading member of the Front for a Country in Solidarity (FrePaSo), an alliance formed in 1995 by the Frente Grande, the Socialist Party, and other center- left parties, becoming the first president of the Buenos Aires City Legislature upon its replacement of the Deliberative Council in 1997. Ibarra was elected on May 7, 2000, as Mayor of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires in the first round, defeating Domingo Cavallo, former Economy Minister of the country. He was re-elected mayor in 2003, winning the run-off election against the center-right businessman Mauricio Macri. He was supported by newly elected President N√©stor Kirchner, and became a leading \\"transversal\\" figure during the Kirchner presidency (allies of the president without belonging to his party). Some of Ibarra's most significant works as mayor include the expansion and refurbishment of the Pedro de Elizalde Children's Hospital, initiating construction on subway Line H, and the purchase of the derelict but architecturally significant CIAE power station, later converted into the Usina del Arte (Arts Powerhouse). On December 30, 2004, the Rep√∫blica Cromagnon nightclub fire killed 194 people and raised a wave of accusations against political officials of the city. Ibarra was accused of tolerating or ignoring a lack of safety checks, of conducting the rescue operations improperly, and other charges. On November 14, 2005, an impeachment jury formed by a commission of the Buenos Aires Legislature suspended him for four months. He accused the opposition of manipulating the families of Rep√∫blica Cromagnon's victims in order to ruin his career, and upon being notified of the suspension, he announced did not resign but await for the investigation to be concluded. The Executive Branch of Buenos Aires was in the meantime presided over by Vice-Mayor Jorge Telerman. On March 7, 2006, the impeachment jury commission ruled the dismissal of Ibarra as mayor of Buenos Aires. Of the 15 members of the commission, 10 voted for Ibarra's dismissal, 4 against, and one abstained. The accusers had additionally asked for a 10-year ban from public office duties, but the members of the commission only asked for 6 years at most, and finally did not decide on any sort of ban. In the City elections of June 2, 2007, Ibarra's party list for the City Legislature gained second place and he and four other members of his coalition - the Popular Progressive Front - were elected for the term starting December 10, 2007, in support of President Kirchner's unsuccessful mayoral candidate, Daniel Filmus. Ibarra was reelected to the City Legislature in 2011. His sister, Vilma Ibarra, is a National Deputy and former Senator. References * Bloomberg, 7 March 2006.

The snakes may be inserted into the container while still alive, causing them to drown on their own, or the snake may be stunned first by being placed on ice, after which the distiller cuts the snake open, guts it, and then sews it shut again. Upon removal from the ice, the snake will briefly reawaken and thrash around, before curling into an aggressive striking pose and dying. The latter method is sometimes preferred because the removal of the snake's digestive tract can noticeably reduce the pungent smell of the finished wine, and because the snakes often die in a coiled position that is visually attractive inside the jars, suggesting the snake was fierce in spirit. *Mixed: The fresh body fluids of the snake are mixed directly into prepared alcohol and consumed immediately in the form of a shot. Snake blood wine is prepared by slicing a snake along its belly and draining its blood directly into the drinking vessel filled with rice wine or grain alcohol. Snake bile wine is made by mixing the alcohol with the snake's gall bladder and bile, and snake heart wine is made by putting the still-beating heart of the slaughtered snake into a bottle of alcohol. History Snakes and their viscera have long been considered by followers of Traditional Chinese medicine to be invaluable for the promotion of vitality and health. The drink was first recorded to be used in China during the Western Zhou dynasty (771 BC) and the medicinal use of snakes was noted in the medical manual Shen nong ben cao jing (Á•ûËæ≤Êú¨ËçâÁ∂ì) compiled between 300 B.C. and 200 A.D. The detailed use of various snake feces, their body parts, and various preparations were greatly elaborated in Li Shizhen's Bencao Gangmu (Êú¨ËçâÁ∂±ÁõÆ). Snake bile was offered to Yang Jisheng as treatment for the injuries he suffered in prison circa 1554. Snake wine can be found in many areas of Vietnam, Southeast Asia and Southern China. Claims of medicinal value Snakes are widely believed to possess medicinal qualities and the wine is often advertised to cure everything from farsightedness to hair loss, as well as to increase sexual performance. In Vietnam, snake wine (R∆∞·ª£u r·∫Øn) is widely believed by some individuals to improve health and virility. A similar drink is made with dehydrated geckos or sea horses rather than snakes. Snake wine, due to its high alcohol percentage, is traditionally drunk in shot glasses. It is illegal to import snake wine to many countries because many of the snakes used for its production are endangered species.  Health risks  The risks of ingesting snake wine include systemic envenomation from the contained venom, which may present features differing from direct envenomation by snakebite. A number of health problems of the vascular system may result, including damage to the vascular wall endothelium, abnormal platelet function and activation, and coagulopathy.. There have been reports from China that such snakes have bitten humans, though they had supposedly been in the bottle for months.

She was portrayed by Carolyn McCormick from 1991 to 1997 and in 1999. The character was revived in 2002, but made far fewer appearances on the show. Olivet is one of only five characters who have appeared in all four of the Law & Order series set in New York City. The other four are Lennie Briscoe (Jerry Orbach), Ed Green (Jesse L. Martin), Arthur Branch (Fred Dalton Thompson), and Elizabeth Rodgers (Leslie Hendrix). Olivet and police psychiatrist Emil Skoda (J.K. Simmons) are the only Law & Order characters to make crossover appearances on New York Undercover, another series produced by Dick Wolf. She has appeared in 94 episodes of the franchise (87 episodes of Law & Order, five episodes of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, one episode of Law & Order: Criminal Intent and one episode of Law & Order: Trial by Jury). Character biography Olivet is introduced as a clinical psychologist who performs consultation work for the 27th Detective Squad and District Attorney's office in Manhattan. She is usually tasked with interviewing murder suspects to assess whether or not they are legally sane, and to assist the DA's office in forming psychological profiles. In her first appearance, she is hired by the precinct as a grief counselor for Det. Mike Logan (Chris Noth) when his partner Max Greevey (George Dzundza) is murdered in the line of duty. After a rocky start, she helps Logan cope with the loss, and the two form a close bond. The character appears in several episodes afterward. Olivet does not offer easy answers with more complicated cases. This tendency results some frustration to Executive ADA Ben Stone (Michael Moriarty) and particularly to his successor, Jack McCoy (Sam Waterston), whose prosecution strategies are sometimes hampered by her diagnoses. She is also generally in favor of compassionate, involved psychotherapy in mental institutions, rather than imprisonment or antipsychotic drugs, for genuinely disturbed criminals; this is often shown to clash with the detectives' sense of justice. In the 1992 episode \\"Helpless\\", Olivet is molested and raped by a gynecologist, Dr. Alex Merritt (Paul Hecht). While Merritt is eventually incarcerated, Olivet's emotional scars never fully heal. later in the third season at the 9th episode point of view Olivet returns but her rape comes back to haunt her and threaten good judgement. Where she's been subpoenaed by the woman's lawyer who she interviewed of killing a man and it maybe a rape case, the district attorney remembers Olivet's rape case later Executive DA Ben Stone apologizes to her and forgives him. Several years later, as she is talking to Logan in the 2006 Law & Order: Criminal Intent episode \\"To the Bone\\", she is implied to have started a family. The character was effectively written out of the show in 1997; in the Law & Order universe, Olivet goes into private practice. She is replaced by Dr. Emil Skoda. In the 2002 season, she returns to do freelance work with the DA's office. She would later appear in several episodes of Law & Order. McCoy's volatile relationship with Olivet begins with his first encounter with her in the 1994 episode \\"Blue Bamboo\\". In that episode, Olivet interviews a defendant (Laura Linney) who had murdered a sexually abusive employer and informs McCoy professionally that she believes the woman was traumatized by the abuse she suffered. McCoy retorts belligerently that she does not belong on his witness list. Since then, McCoy has had a tenuous relationship with Olivet. At times, he has retreated from his defensive position to convince her to help; examples include the episode \\"Privileged\\", in which McCoy needs her expert testimony to convict an alcoholic (Eddie Malavarca) accused of murdering his foster parents. In the 2008 episode \\"Betrayal\\", McCoy reveals that, in her days as a grief counselor, Olivet had sex with a police detective whose partner had been murdered; while not directly stated, it is implied that the detective was Logan. Olivet feels compelled to contradict the prosecution's expert witness, Dr. Lydia Stronach (Nancy Hess), who had done studies on child sexual abuse that were officially censured as dangerous and damaging by the authoritative body in her field. When Olivet informs McCoy that she will be testifying for the defense, he feels he has no other choice but to provide Michael Cutter (Linus Roache), his successor as Executive ADA, with information that could be used in their favor when cross-examining Olivet. When Cutter questions Olivet during the trial, she confirms the affair, but adds that she stopped treating the (still unnamed) detective shortly after the relationship began. Appearance outside Law & Order  * In the 1996 New York Undercover episode \\"Smack Is Back\\", she counsels Detective Nina Moreno (Lauren V√©lez). * In the 2000 Law & Order: Special Victims Unit episode \\"Baby Killer\\", she is hired by a defense attorney to help defend a young boy accused of murder and finds herself at odds with a former colleague, Alexandra Cabot (Stephanie March). She also makes brief appearances in the SVU episodes \\"...Or Just Look Like One\\", \\"Abuse\\", \\"Deadly Ambition\\", \\"Pathological\\" and \\"Remember Me Too\\". * In the Law & Order: Trial by Jury episode \\"Day\\", Olivet consults with Tracey Kibre (Bebe Neuwirth) on the mental stability of a rape suspect whom Kibre is prosecuting. * In the 2006 Law & Order: Criminal Intent episode \\"To the Bone\\", Logan goes to her for counselling after he accidentally kills an undercover police officer. * Also on Law & Order: Criminal Intent, Olivet treats Detective Alexandra Eames (Kathryn Erbe) after she is abducted and tortured, and her partner Detective Robert Goren (Vincent D‚ÄôOnofrio) while he is on suspension.

The Auckland Peering Exchange was established to allow entities connected to the APE switches in Auckland to send traffic directly to and from each other rather than via their ISP. This activity is known as peering. This provides improvements in speed as traffic travels directly between the parties and reduces load on the network by reducing the need for traffic to be duplicated through one or more intermediate ISP routers. In some cases this also avoids traffic being routed \\"out of town\\", or incurring ISP's traffic charges. The Auckland Peering Exchange provides two route servers which contain routing details for each of the participants. This simplifies peering enormously for most exchange users. APE grew out of discussions on the NZNOG mailing list.\\"Sky Tower/Sky City colo update\\", NZNOG April 2009 The Sky Tower (Auckland) was agreed to be a sensible meeting place, since it was already equipped as a telehousing facility, it is a good high- point for wireless access, and it is a neutral point to meet.

This species was recently split from the similar black-tailed gnatcatcher of the Sonoran and Chihuahuan deserts. This bird is often solitary, but joins with other birds in winter flocks. Description The male California gnatcatcher is dusky gray overall, distinguished only by its black crown and thin black beak. It has a long, thin black tail with narrow white tips and edges on the underside of the tail feathers. However, the male loses its plumage colors by winter and obtains a plumage color similar to the females. The female is similar to the male, but with a blue-gray instead of a black crown. In its range from coastal Southern California south through Baja California and Baja California Sur, this inconspicuous non-migratory resident is most often seen flitting hastily into undergrowth, or heard giving its call, which sounds like a kitten's meow, a rising and falling zeeeeer, zeeeeer. Diet The California gnatcatcher's diet consists of small insects and spiders. Habitat In the northern part of its range (Southern California) this species was listed as Threatened by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in 1993 due to increasing development in its habitat, coastal sage scrub (current loss of coastal sage scrub in U.S is estimated at 70 to 90 percent). Critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act has been designated for the California gnatcatcher. This species is especially vulnerable as a metapopulation due to its small populations in a limited habitat often live in the prime land to be developed for housing and commerce that can be easily isolated and reduced in size. Though some of its habitat has been saved in national forests and state parks, its population has been severely fragmented. There are, however, ongoing efforts to preserve more open land in southern California to help ensure that this species will not disappear from its former range. California gnatcatchers are a focal species in many regional habitat conservation planning efforts. Ecology and reproduction Monogamous pairs care for their brood of 3‚Äì5 eggs in cone- shaped nests. Brown-headed cowbirds are parasites that lay eggs in their nests.

A standby power system may include a standby generator, batteries and other apparatus. Emergency power systems are installed to protect life and property from the consequences of loss of primary electric power supply. It is a type of continual power system. They find uses in a wide variety of settings from homes to hospitals, scientific laboratories, data centers,Fuel cell in the data center Munich telecommunicationIndia orders 10.000 fuel cell emergency power systems equipment and ships. Emergency power systems can rely on generators, deep-cycle batteries, flywheel energy storage or fuel cells.Fuel Cells in Backup Power ApplicationsDOE Fuel Cells for Backup Power History Emergency power systems were used as early as World War II on naval ships. In combat, a ship may lose the function of its boilers, which power the steam turbines for the ship's generator. In such a case, one or more diesel engines are used to drive back-up generators. Early transfer switches relied on manual operation; two switches would be placed horizontally, in line and the \\"on\\" position facing each other. a rod is placed in between. In order to operate the switch one source must be turned off, the rod moved to the other side and the other source turned on. Operation in buildings Emergency power electric generator in a water purification plant, driven by a marine propulsion diesel engine Mains power can be lost due to downed lines, malfunctions at a sub-station, inclement weather, planned blackouts or in extreme cases a grid-wide failure. In modern buildings, most emergency power systems have been and are still based on generators. Usually, these generators are Diesel engine driven, although smaller buildings may use a gasoline engine driven generator and larger ones a gas turbine. However, lately, more use is being made of deep cycle batteries and other technologies such as flywheel energy storage or fuel cells. These latter systems do not produce polluting gases, thereby allowing the placement to be done within the building. Also, as a second advantage, they do not require a separate shed to be built for fuel storage. With regular generators, an automatic transfer switch is used to connect emergency power. One side is connected to both the normal power feed and the emergency power feed; and the other side is connected to the load designated as emergency. If no electricity comes in on the normal side, the transfer switch uses a solenoid to throw a triple pole, single throw switch. This switches the feed from normal to emergency power. The loss of normal power also triggers a battery operated starter system to start the generator, similar to using a car battery to start an engine. Once the transfer switch is switched and the generator starts, the building's emergency power comes back on (after going off when normal power was lost). Unlike emergency lights, emergency lighting is not a type of light fixture; it is a pattern of the building's normal lights that provides a path of lights to allow for safe exit, or lights up service areas such as mechanical rooms and electric rooms. Exit signs, Fire alarm systems (that are not on back up batteries) and the electric motor pumps for the fire sprinklers are almost always on emergency power. Other equipment on emergency power may include smoke isolation dampers, smoke evacuation fans, elevators, handicap doors and outlets in service areas. Hospitals use emergency power outlets to power life support systems and monitoring equipment. Some buildings may even use emergency power as part of normal operations, such as a theater using it to power show equipment because \\"the show must go on.\\" Operation in aviation A view of an Aviation 501-1228-04 Emergency Power Supply by Repaero The use of Emergency power systems in aviation can be either in the aircraft or on the ground. In commercial and military aircraft it is critical to maintain power to essential systems during an emergency. This can be done via Ram air turbines or battery emergency power supplies which enables pilots to maintain radio contact and continue to navigate using MFD, GPS, VOR receiver or directional gyro during for more than an hour. Localizer, glideslope, and other instrument landing aids (such as microwave transmitters) are both high power consumers and mission-critical, and cannot be reliably operated from a battery supply, even for short periods. Hence, when absolute reliability is required (such as when Category 3 operations are in force at the airport) it is usual to run the system from a diesel generator with automatic switchover to the mains supply should the generator fail. This avoids any interruption to transmission while a generator is brought up to operating speed. This is opposed to the typical view of emergency power systems, where the backup generators are seen as secondary to the mains electrical supply. Electronic device protection Computers, communication networks, and other modern electronic devices need not only power, but also a steady flow of it to continue to operate. If the source voltage drops significantly or drops out completely, these devices will fail, even if the power loss is only for a fraction of a second. Because of this, even a generator back-up does not provide protection because of the start-up time involved. To achieve more comprehensive loss protection, extra equipment such as surge protectors, inverters, or sometimes a complete uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is used. UPS systems can be local (to one device or one power outlet) or may extend building-wide. A local UPS is a small box that fits under a desk or a telecom rack and powers a small number of devices. A building-wide UPS may take any of several different forms, depending on the application. It directly feeds a system of outlets designated as UPS feed and can power a large number of devices. Since telephone exchanges use DC, the building's battery room is generally wired directly to the consuming equipment and floats continuously on the output of the rectifiers that normally supply DC rectified from utility power. When utility power fails, the battery carries the load without needing to switch. With this simple though somewhat expensive system, some exchanges have never lost power for a moment since the 1920s. Structure and operation in utility stations Diagram of a redundant power supply system. In recent years, large units of a utility power station are usually designed on a unit system basis in which the required devices, including the boiler, the turbine generator unit, and its power (step up) and unit (auxiliary) transformer are solidly connected as one unit. A less common set-up consists of two units grouped together with one common station auxiliary. As each turbine generator unit has its own attached unit auxiliary transformer, it is connected to the circuit automatically. For starting the unit, the auxiliaries are supplied with power by another unit (auxiliary) transformer or station auxiliary transformer. The period of switching from the first unit transformer to the next unit is designed for automatic, instantaneous operation in times when the emergency power system needs to kick in. It is imperative that the power to unit auxiliaries not fail during a station shutdown (an occurrence known as black-out when all regular units temporarily fail). Instead, during shutdowns the grid is expected to remain operational. When problems occur, it is usually due to reverse power relays and frequency-operated relays on grid lines due to severe grid disturbances. Under these circumstances, the emergency station supply must kick in to avoid damage to any equipment and to prevent hazardous situations such as the release of hydrogen gas from generators to the local environment. In nuclear power plants Emergency power systems, called there Emergency Diesel Generators (EDGs), are a required feature in nuclear power plants. They are typically installed in sets of three. The EDG installation is designed to the same safety-grade requirements as the other safety systems in the plant. The next (upcoming) generation of nuclear power plants includes some designs with multiple independent banks of EDGs (as in the ABWRs Simplified Active Safety Systems [for the ABWR] ). Controlling the emergency power system For a 208 VAC emergency supply system, a central battery system with automatic controls, located in the power station building, is used to avoid long electric supply wires. This central battery system consists of lead-acid battery cell units to make up a 12 or 24 VDC system as well as stand-by cells, each with its own battery charging unit. Also needed are a voltage sensing unit capable of receiving 208 VAC and an automatic system that is able to signal to and activate the emergency supply circuit in case of failure of 208 VAC station supply.

Approximately 700 million geese are slaughtered each year for meat worldwide. Origins and characteristics A pair of swan goose-type domestic geese swimming In Europe, northern Africa, and western Asia, the original domesticated geese are derived from the greylag goose (Anser anser). In eastern Asia, the original domesticated geese are derived from the swan goose (Anser cygnoides); these are commonly known as Chinese geese. Both have been widely introduced in more recent times, and modern flocks in both areas (and elsewhere, such as Australia and North America) may consist of either species or hybrids between them. Chinese geese may be readily distinguished from European geese by the large knob at the base of the bill, though hybrids may exhibit every degree of variation between the two species.Buckland, R., & Guy, G. (2002). Goose Production. Chapter 1: Origins and Breeds of Domestic Geese. FAO Agriculture Department. The domestication, as Charles Darwin remarks (The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication i. 287), is of very ancient date; there is archaeological evidence for domesticated geese in Egypt more than 4,000 years ago.Hugo, S. (undated). Geese: the underestimated species. FAO Agriculture Department. They have been selected for larger size, with domesticated breeds weighing up to , compared to the maximum of for the wild swan goose and for the wild greylag goose.del Hoyo, J., Elliott, A., & Sargatal, J., eds. Handbook of Birds of the World Vol. 1: 581. Lynx Edicions, Barcelona. This affects their body structure; whereas wild geese have a horizontal posture and slim rear end, domesticated geese lay down large fat deposits toward the tail end, giving a fat rear and forcing the bird into a more upright posture. Although their heavy weight affects their ability to fly, most breeds of domestic geese are capable of flight. Geese have also been strongly selected for fecundity, with females laying up to 50 eggs per year, compared to 5‚Äì12 eggs for a wild goose. As most domestic geese display little sexual dimorphism, sexing is based primarily on physical characteristics and behaviour. Males are typically taller and larger than females, and have longer necks. In addition, males can be distinguished by the protective behaviour they exhibit towards their mates and their offspring - the male will typically stand between his partner and any perceived threat. Changes to the plumage are variable; many have been selected to lose dark brown tones of the wild bird. The result is an animal marked, or completely covered in white feathers. Others retain plumage close to the natural; some, such as the modern Toulouse goose look almost identical to the greylag in plumage, differing only in structure. White geese are often preferred as they look better plucked and dressed, with any small down feathers remaining being less conspicuous. From the time of the Romans, white geese have been held in great esteem. Geese produce large edible eggs, weighing . They can be used in cooking just like chicken's eggs, though they have proportionally more yolk, and this cooks to a slightly denser consistency. The taste is much the same as that of a chicken egg, but gamier. Like their wild ancestors, domestic geese are very protective of their offspring and other members of the flock. The gander will normally place himself between any perceived threat and his family. Owing to their highly aggressive nature, loud call and sensitivity to unusual movements, geese can contribute towards the security of a property. In late 1950s South Vietnam, the VNAF used flocks of geese to guard their parked aircraft at night due to the noise they would make at intruders.Grandolini, A. Indo-Chinese Fighting ' Cats: Grumman's Superb Bearcat in Vietnam Air Enthusiast magazine article July-August 1997 No.70 p.17 Because domestic geese descended from the Greylag goose are effectively the same species as their wild ancestor (being a subspecies formed through domestication), escaped individuals readily breed with wild populations, resulting in the offspring sometimes resembling either one of their parents, or bearing mixed plumage with patterns of grey and white feathers and orange beaks.

There are Mother Goose tales, such as a farmwife might have told; there is the proverbial goose that laid the golden eggs, warning about the perils of greed. The geese in the temple of Juno on the Capitoline Hill were said by Livy to have saved Rome from the Gauls around 390 BC when they were disturbed in a night attack. The story may be an attempt to explain the origin of the sacred flock of geese at Rome.

He served as the head men's basketball coach at the University of Dayton from 1964 to 1989, compiling a record of 437‚Äì275. His Dayton Flyers were champions of the 1968 National Invitation Tournament and runners-up at the 1967 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament. Donoher was also the athletic director at Dayton from 1976 to 1980. Early years Donoher began his career as a basketball player at Central Catholic High School in Toledo, Ohio from 1947 to 1950. He played three years of varsity basketball for coach Tom Blackburn at the University of Dayton, scoring 578 career points in 72 games. Following graduation from Dayton in 1954, Donoher served a two-year enlistment in the United States Army. Returning to Dayton after the end of his service, Donoher accepted a part-time basketball scout position offered by Blackburn. In February 1963, Blackburn made Donoher the University's first full-time assistant coach. Blackburn had been suffering from cancer for most of the 1963‚Äì64 season. When the disease's effects became too debilitating for him to continue, Donoher took over as interim coach for the last three games of the season. In March 1964, Blackburn died from cancer, and Donoher was formally named his successor. However, Dayton credits the entire 1963‚Äì64 season to Blackburn. Head coaching experience Donoher enjoyed immediate success as a head coach, going 22‚Äì7 in his inaugural season and guiding the Flyers to a berth in the NCAA tournament, reaching the Sweet Sixteen. Two years later, Donoher's Flyers defeated Western Kentucky University, the University of Tennessee, Virginia Tech, and the University of North Carolina en route to a national runner-up finish in the NCAA tournament. During his tenure at Dayton, Donoher guided the Flyers to the NCAA tournament eight times, reaching the Sweet Sixteen five times, the Elite Eight twice, and the national final once. Additionally, Dayton played in seven NIT post-season competitions under Donoher, winning the championship in 1968.http://www.collegesports.com/auto_pdf/p_hotos/s_chools/dayt/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/postseason Donoher is Dayton's all-time winningest coach with a 437‚Äì275 record (.614), including a 20‚Äì16 post season record (.556).https://web.archive.org/web/20051025020647/http://www.ncaa.org/stats/m_basketball/coaching/all_d1_coaching_records.pdf Donoher-coached teams were noted for their discipline, tenacity, and sound fundamentals, frequently besting teams with greater athleticism. Donoher served as an assistant to Head Coach Bobby Knight on the gold medal winning U.S. men's basketball team at the 1984 Summer Olympic Games.http://archive.usab.com/mens/national/moly_1984.html Awards and recognition Donoher has been inducted into the Toledo Area High School Hall of Fame, the Ohio High School Basketball Coaches Association Hall of Fame, and the University of Dayton Hall of Fame.https://web.archive.org/web/20050824192736/http://www.ohiobkcoaches.com/HallofFame/HOF2000/dondonoher.html On February 17, 2015 it was announced that Donoher had been selected for induction into the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame.http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/sports/college-basketball/donoher-to- be-inducted-into-college-basketball-hal/nkCxh/ In 1998, the University of Dayton named the new state of the art addition to the University of Dayton Arena after Donoher .

Blaise Pascal likely contributed considerable portions of the text. Its linguistic companion piece is the Port Royal Grammar (1660) by Arnauld and Lancelot. Written in French, it became quite popular and was in use up to the twentieth century, introducing the reader to logic, and exhibiting strong Cartesian elements in its metaphysics and epistemology (Arnauld having been one of the main philosophers whose objections were published, with replies, in Descartes' Meditations on First Philosophy). The Port-Royal Logic is sometimes cited as a paradigmatic example of traditional term logic. The philosopher Louis Marin particularly studied it in the 20th century (La Critique du discours, √âditions de Minuit, 1975), while Michel Foucault considered it, in The Order of Things, one of the bases of the classical √©pist√©m√®. Among the contributions of the Port-Royal Logic is the introduction of a distinction between comprehension and extension, which would later become a more refined distinction between intension and extension. Roughly speaking: a definition with more qualifications or features (the intension) denotes a class with fewer members (the extension), and vice versa. The main idea traces back through the scholastic philosophers to Aristotle's ideas about genus and species,Joseph C. Frisch, Extension and Comprehension in Logic, Philosophical Library, New York, 1969. and is fundamental in the philosophy of Leibniz.Bertrand Russel, A Critical Exposition of the Philosophy of Leibniz, Routledge, London, 1900, 1992. More recently, it has been related to mathematical lattice theory in Formal Concept Analysis, and independently formalized similarly by Yu. Schreider's group in Moscow,http://alexei.nfshost.com/biosem/schreidr/schreidr.html Jon Barwise & Jerry Seligman in Information Flow,Jon Barwise and Jerry Seligman, Information Flow: The Logic of Distributed Systems, Cambridge University Press, 1997, and others.

High quality residential and retail developments that the German school attracted are present in the ≈åmori-sann≈ç area. ≈åmori is home to the headquarters of the automotive company Isuzu, which has offices in the Belport complex a few hundred metres from ≈åmori station. Prior to its development as a convenient residential and business location, ≈åmori was laced with a network of small rivers which were used by many locals for drying harvested nori (seaweed), a staple of the Japanese diet. Modern ≈åmori is built on mostly reclaimed land, and is very much a traditional Shinto area; there are many shrines in the area, and during the August o-bon festival, mikoshi parades are very common. ≈åmori-sann≈ç, to the west of ≈åmori station, is an upscale neighbourhood compared to the other side of the tracks, and ≈åmori- sann≈ç is known to be traditionally an area where Japanese poets, philosophers and writers have made their home.  World War II POW Camp  ≈åmori was the site of an Imperial Japanese Army-administered prisoner-of-war camp during World War II. The inhumane conditions in the camp were described in detail in the award winning book Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption describing the life of American Olympic Athlete Louis Zamperini. The camp was brutal and included in its staff known war criminal Mutsuhiro Watanabe. However, US Navy submarine commander Richard O'Kane found Omori camp harsh, but essentially correct in administration, particularly compared with the ≈åfuna Imperial Japanese Navy detention centre. Local anti- militarist Japanese civilians sometimes helped the prisoners with small gifts of food.O'Kane, Richard H. Clear the Bridge!

Founded in 1912, Penn State Lehigh Valley is the oldest of Penn State's commonwealth campuses. History In 1912, Penn State opened its first permanent \\"branch school\\" in the attic of an elementary school in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Designed to provide professional training to employees, the Allentown Branch School offered evening courses in engineering. Over the next few decades additional programs were added, including three-year evening programs in engineering, technology, and business administration, as well as \\"continuation school\\" offered one day a week for workers in silk mills and other local factories. Eventually the evening programs were compressed into a one-year daytime program designed to meet the needs of returning World War II veterans. By 1951, the curriculum had expanded to include associate degrees in Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering Technology, business programs, and graduate credit classes for teachers. The University purchased a converted factory building at 725 Ridge Avenue in Allentown to house the \\"Allentown Center.\\" In the 1970s, the Allentown Campus grew rapidly and moved first to larger quarters in the Fogelsville School Building, and then, in 1977, to its campus in Fogelsville, Pennsylvania which was built on a tract of land donated by Mohr Orchards. Along with the new facilities came a new mission to provide the first two years of Penn State baccalaureate degrees in addition to expanded continuing education programming. The Penn State Lehigh Valley campus in Center Valley, Pennsylvania The 1990s brought considerable change and subsequent growth to the campus. Changing its name to Penn State Lehigh Valley to better reflect the community it serves, the campus became part of a college within the University composed of Penn State Lehigh Valley and Penn State Berks. The two- campus college was designated Penn State Berks-Lehigh Valley College. Together the campuses shared faculty and developed four-year baccalaureate degree programs in a number of disciplines. With the addition of four-year baccalaureate degree programs came an increase in enrollment, and in 2003 Penn State Lehigh Valley opened a second site, the Corporate Learning Center, located at 100 Brodhead Road in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The Bethlehem site currently housed continuing education programs as well as the Elementary Education degree program classes. In 2005 the University restructured across the state, and discontinued the Berks-Lehigh Valley College partnership. Currently, approximately 900 undergraduate students attend Penn State Lehigh Valley. An additional 3,000 students participate each year in its continuing education programs. On March 20, 2009 the Penn State University board approved the purchase of the facility owned by Lehigh Valley College in Center Valley. Classes moved to Center Valley in September 2009. Penn State shared the facility with Lehigh Valley College until that school closed in December 2009. The new facility more than doubled the size of the building on the old campus. With the increased space at the Center Valley campus, programs at the Corporate Learning Center were moved to Center Valley and the Corporate Learning was closed at the end of 2010. Athletics Penn State‚ÄìLehigh Valley teams participate as a member of the United States Collegiate Athletic Association (USCAA). The Nittany Lions are a member of the Pennsylvania State University Athletic Conference (PSUAC).

ONO membership comprises news ombudsman, readers' representatives and standards editors from around the world, working online, in print, in television and radio. All are individuals who work for professional news organizations such as the BBC, the Guardian, CBC, the ABC and SBS in Australia and the Hindu in India. Editorial standards editors work to maintain ethical practice in their newsrooms, while ombudsmen or reader representatives attempt to find mutually satisfactory solutions to complaints about coverage. Both standards editors and ombudsmen seek to explain the workings of journalism to their audiences. Since its inception in 1980, ONO has built an active cohort of European, Scandinavian, British, South American, Indian, Australian and Canadian editorial standards and editorial complaints handling executives. It is also working to strengthen relationships with the Asian news media who share its editorial principles of independence, fairness, balance and accuracy. Purposes of ONO The official web site of ONO states that it is: \\"Dedicated to protecting and enhancing quality journalism by encouraging respectful and truthful discourse about journalism‚Äôs practices and purposes.\\" The Organization of News Ombudsmen and Standards Editors is a best practice organisation, encouraging reliable editorial standards processes and effective editorial complaints handling mechanisms. ONO aims to: ‚Ä¢ Promote the values of accuracy, fairness and balance in news reporting for the public good. ‚Ä¢ Assist media organizations to provide mechanisms to ensure they remain accountable to consumers of their news. ‚Ä¢ Encourage transparency within news media organizations to develop trust within their audience. ‚Ä¢ Support the role of news ombudsmen, readers' editors and other mediators between the news consumer and the media organization. Annual conference The main event on the ONO calendar is its annual conference, which examines current challenges facing news media and news audiences and how those issues are affecting the work of its members. The 2019 ONO Conference was held in New York in association with the Columbia Journalism Review. The conference, entitled ‚ÄúJournalism in a Polarized World ‚Äì Sharing Common Ground\\", examined the role and responsibilities of news media, standards editors and news ombudsman in a time of heightened political, social and economic polarization. ONO's 2009 conference was held in Washington DC, at the offices of National Public Radio, The Washington Post and the Washington Bureau of The New York Times. The 2010 conference took place at Reuters Institute, and St Peter's College Oxford University, Oxford, England, the 2011 conference at CBC in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and the 2013 conference in Los Angeles, California. Conferences in Copenhagen (2014), Hamburg (2015), Buenos Aires (2016), Chennai (2017) and Amsterdam (2018) followed. Topics discussed at annual conferences are usually of an ethical nature, because news ombudsmen and standards editors are more often than not concerned with the ethics of reporting the news. Some of topics raised in the past include coverage of minorities, coverage of sex crimes, the relationship to the news department, the use of anonymous sources, invasion of privacy, plagiarism, conflicts of interest. Mini-conferences Besides attending the ONO's annual conference, many members of the ONO often participate in small mini-conferences which are conducted by conference telephone calls or email throughout the year. Members can raise issues they are dealing with and swap viewpoints on a wide range of topics that news ombudsmen and standards editors deal with on a regular basis. The goal is to provide participants with support, counsel and problem-solving ideas. See also * Organizational ombudsman External links * NewsOmbudsmen.org - Official ONO website.

He began his parliamentary career in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly (1882‚Äì1898, 1900) and served as a government minister under Henry Parkes. He transferred to the new House of Representatives after Federation, representing the Division of Macquarie from 1901 to 1906. He served as Postmaster-General in the Reid Government from 1904 to 1905. Early years Born in Colyton, near Penrith, west of Sydney, the son of a hotel keeper, Smith was educated at public schools before gaining work with the railways. Following his marriage in 1879, Smith turned to auctioneering and grazing before following his brother, Thomas Richard, into Parliament. State politics Smith was first elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1882, representing East Macquarie until its abolition in 1894 and then ran for nearby Bathurst. Described as \\"tall, spare and bearded\\" but \\"not renowned for his oratory skills\\", the non-smoking teetotaller was made Secretary for Mines by Henry Parkes in 1889 and the inaugural Secretary for Agriculture in 1890, in which position he founded Hawkesbury Agricultural College. He also found the time to serve as Mayor of Leichhardt Municipal Council from 1888‚Äì89. Smith lost his seat by 103 votes at the 1898 New South Wales election when he ran on what many considered to be an anti-federalist stance and ran unsuccessfully against Edmund Barton for Hastings and Macleay in a by-election later that same year before returning to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in a by-election for Canterbury on 9 June 1900. However, his victory (by five votes) was declared void and Smith was defeated at the subsequently reheld by-election on 28 July 1900. Federal politics Undated photo While not a parliamentarian, Smith served on the executive of the Free Trade Party and began planning his campaign for a seat in the new federal parliament. He decided to contest Macquarie at the first federal election in 1901 but was given little chance of victory by observers and the local press, who pointed to his earlier anti- federal views and his recent electoral losses as proof that he exercised little influence amongst the electorate. Smith, however, gained the endorsement of the local branch of the influential Loyal Orange Lodge and the support of Free Trade Party leader George Reid‚Äîwho enjoyed a large personal support amongst voters‚Äîand was elected. In 1903, he again won Macquarie, defeating William Sandford. Smith served as a senior member of the Free Trade Party in opposition before helping to engineer the downfall of the Chris Watson government and its replacement by George Reid as Prime Minister. Widely considered Reid's most faithful henchman during his time in parliament, Smith was made Postmaster-General by Reid but retired from political life following his defeat at the 1906 elections. Smith died in Sydney on 21 February 1934, preceded by his wife and youngest son, killed during the Gallipoli landings. Smith's eldest son, also named Sydney, served as President of the New South Wales Cricket Association from 1935‚Äì66.

It is particularly useful for efficiently implementing backtracking algorithms, such as Donald Knuth's Algorithm X for the exact cover problem. Algorithm X is a recursive, nondeterministic, depth- first, backtracking algorithm that finds all solutions to the exact cover problem. Some of the better-known exact cover problems include tiling, the n queens problem, and Sudoku. The name dancing links, which was suggested by Donald Knuth, stems from the way the algorithm works, as iterations of the algorithm cause the links to \\"dance\\" with partner links so as to resemble an \\"exquisitely choreographed dance.\\" Knuth credits Hiroshi Hitotsumatsu and K≈çhei Noshita with having invented the idea in 1979, but it is his paper which has popularized it. Implementation As the remainder of this article discusses the details of an implementation technique for Algorithm X, the reader is strongly encouraged to read the Algorithm X article first. =Main ideas= The idea of DLX is based on the observation that in a circular doubly linked list of nodes, x.left.right ‚Üê x.right; x.right.left ‚Üê x.left; will remove node x from the list, while x.left.right ‚Üê x; x.right.left ‚Üê x; will restore x's position in the list, assuming that x.right and x.left have been left unmodified. This works regardless of the number of elements in the list, even if that number is 1. Knuth observed that a naive implementation of his Algorithm X would spend an inordinate amount of time searching for 1's. When selecting a column, the entire matrix had to be searched for 1's. When selecting a row, an entire column had to be searched for 1's. After selecting a row, that row and a number of columns had to be searched for 1's. To improve this search time from complexity O(n) to O(1), Knuth implemented a sparse matrix where only 1's are stored. At all times, each node in the matrix will point to the adjacent nodes to the left and right (1's in the same row), above and below (1's in the same column), and the header for its column (described below). Each row and column in the matrix will consist of a circular doubly- linked list of nodes. =Header= Each column will have a special node known as the \\"column header,\\" which will be included in the column list, and will form a special row (\\"control row\\") consisting of all the columns which still exist in the matrix. Finally, each column header may optionally track the number of nodes in its column, so that locating a column with the lowest number of nodes is of complexity O(n) rather than O(n√óm) where n is the number of columns and m is the number of rows. Selecting a column with a low node count is a heuristic which improves performance in some cases, but is not essential to the algorithm. =Exploring= In Algorithm X, rows and columns are regularly eliminated from and restored to the matrix. Eliminations are determined by selecting a column and a row in that column. If a selected column doesn't have any rows, the current matrix is unsolvable and must be backtracked. When an elimination occurs, all columns for which the selected row contains a 1 are removed, along with all rows (including the selected row) that contain a 1 in any of the removed columns. The columns are removed because they have been filled, and the rows are removed because they conflict with the selected row. To remove a single column, first remove the selected column's header. Next, for each row where the selected column contains a 1, traverse the row and remove it from other columns (this makes those rows inaccessible and is how conflicts are prevented). Repeat this column removal for each column where the selected row contains a 1. This order ensures that any removed node is removed exactly once and in a predictable order, so it can be backtracked appropriately. If the resulting matrix has no columns, then they have all been filled and the selected rows form the solution. =Backtracking= To backtrack, the above process must be reversed using the second algorithm stated above. One requirement of using that algorithm is that backtracking must be done as an exact reversal of eliminations. Knuth's paper gives a clear picture of these relationships and how the node removal and reinsertion works, and provides a slight relaxation of this limitation. =Optional constraints= It is also possible to solve one-cover problems in which a particular constraint is optional, but can be satisfied no more than once. Dancing Links accommodates these with primary columns which must be filled and secondary columns which are optional. This alters the algorithm's solution test from a matrix having no columns to a matrix having no primary columns and if the heuristic of minimum one's in a column is being used then it needs to be checked only within primary columns. Knuth discusses optional constraints as applied to the n queens problem. The chessboard diagonals represent optional constraints, as some diagonals may not be occupied. If a diagonal is occupied, it can be occupied only once.

Komatsu was born in Yokohama in 1928; her mother was the successor to a hereditary line of kannushi (Shinto priests). In 1976, an acquaintance of Komatsu's made a prophecy that a kami was about to descend to Earth. Shortly thereafter, Komatsu was visited in turn by a dragon god, Kannon and Amaterasu, the sun goddess. From that time forward, Komatsu dedicated herself to passing on knowledge from Amaterasu. Faith and practices The Shinmei Aishinkai movement became an official religious organization in 1983. The focus of the movement's practices are ritual purification (okiyome or osame) meant to give ascension to the spirits or jaki of departed people which are still bound to the earth. By doing so, the group hopes to ensure peace and prosperity throughout the world. To that end, rituals have been held following such events as the fall of the Berlin Wall and the September 11 attacks. The movement's main festival, Kamiyo Gy≈çretsu \\"Whole World Procession\\", is held in autumn at the main Tokyo shrine and includes a parade in which members dress in period clothing and proceed through the city. The five main gods worshipped by followers are Amaterasu, Takemikazuchi, Ninigi-no-Mikoto, Kann≈ç, and Ame- no-tajikarao. However, others such as Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto are also regularly worshipped. The Shinmei movement, like many Shinto-derived new religious movements includes a strong emphasis on divination and Wu Xing practices, known as kigaku. This includes the study of kas≈ç, the floor plan of one's house and the influences of energy drawn from various compass directions and shares some similarities with feng shui. The group also has strong ties to Ise Grand Shrine (Mie Prefecture), where the goddess Amaterasu is believed to reside. As of 2008, the group has approximately 50,000 members nationwide. Branch shrines have been established in Hokkaido, Kyushu, Nasu (Tochigi Prefecture), and Hy≈çgo Prefecture. The main shrine is located in Tokyo.

It was programmed by Kathleen O'Brien of Shepardson Microsystems, the company which wrote Atari BASIC, and Assembler Editor shares many design concepts with that language. Assembly times are slow, making the cartridge challenging to use for larger programs. In the manual, Atari recommended the Assembler Editor as a tool for writing subroutines to speed up Atari BASIC. The Atari Macro Assembler was offered by Atari to provide better performance and more powerful features, such as macros, but it was disk-based, copy-protected, and did not include an editor or debugger. Despite the recommendation, commercial software was written using the Assembler Editor, such as the games Eastern Front (1941) and Galahad and the Holy Grail. The source code to the original Assembler Editor was licensed to Optimized Systems Software who shipped EASMD based on it. History Assembler Editor was written by Kathleen O'Brien of Shepardson Microsystems. The company had been hired by Atari to help fit Microsoft 6502 BASIC onto an 8KB ROM, something the programmers at Atari were struggling with. Instead, Bill Wilkinson suggested designing an entirely new version of BASIC, which became Atari BASIC. While Atari BASIC was being written, primarily by Paul Laughton, O'Brien's husband, O'Brien worked on Assembler Editor. Assembler Editor was written \\"by hand\\" by punching codes into a punch tape machine, running the tape through an EPROM burner, and then testing the resulting ROM in an Atari 800. The cartridge was completed before Atari BASIC, and O'Brien spent some time working on portions of that project as well. As part of Shepardson's work on the Atari, a number of common routines were copied into the Atari's operating system. These included the floating point routines, which O'Brien was tasked with writing, although she had not worked on such code before. These routines were considered to be notoriously slow, a topic that Wilkinson often wrote about.  Details  The Assembler Editor is two-pass 6502 assembler in an 8KB cartridge. Both source and object code can be in memory simultaneously, allowing repeated editing, assembly, and running of the resulting code without accessing a disk or tape drive. =Edit= The cartridge starts in EDIT mode. The programmer enters lines of assembly source into the Atari BASIC-like editor. Source text must be prefixed with a line number, or it is interpreted as a command. Like Atari BASIC, Assembler Editor included an \`ENTER\` command that could be used to combine files together into a single larger program listing. Unlike Atari BASIC, Assembler Editor included a number of commands for automatically creating spaced-out line numbers, as well as renumbering lines and deleting them en masse. The editor also had a \`FIND\` command, which was very useful when working with labels. Instructions are listed in the order they will be placed in memory. The starting point for the instructions is specified with the \`*=\` instruction, so, for instance, code intended to be placed in the special \\"page six\\" would be prefixed with the line \`*= $0600\`. Variable names could be assigned to point to specific locations, and this was often combined with an increment \`*= *+1\` to directly encode offsets into tables. Values following instructions were normally interpreted as \\"the value at this memory address\\", but an actual numeric value could be provided as an \\"immediate operand\\" by appending it with a hash, like \`LDA #12\`, which loads the accumulator with the decimal value 12. Hexadecimal was indicated with a dollar sign, \`LDA #$12\` would load the accumulator with 12 hex, or 18 decimal. Indirect addressing was supported using parentheses; \`LDA ($600)\` would use the values in location $600,$601 to produce a 16-bit address, and then load the accumulator with the value found at that location. Errors are reported with numeric error codes, with about 50 such codes in total. =Assemble= Code can be assembled at any time by typing the \`ASM\` command into the editor. Assembler Editor was widely derided as the slowest assembler on the platform. Much of this was due to it sharing much of the editor code with Atari BASIC, which had also been written by Shepardson Microsystems. Atari BASIC was notorious for the very slow routines used to convert numerical constants in code into an internal representation, which used binary coded decimal (BCD) routines in the Atari's operating system. This meant that all numbers, even line numbers, had to be converted to BCD. Oddly, it also meant that \`1E2\` was a legal line number. =Debug= The debugger, really a monitor, is entered with the \`BUG\` command. The \`X\` command returns to EDIT mode. The debugger allows the viewing and changing of registers and memory locations, code tracing, single-step and disassembly.  Example code  The following is 6502 code for Hello World! written for the Assembler Editor: 10 ; HELLO.ASM 20 ; --------- 30 ; 40 ; THIS ATARI ASSEMBLY PROGRAM 50 ; WILL PRINT THE \\"HELLO WORLD\\" 60 ; MESSAGE TO THE SCREEN 70 ; 0100 ; CIO EQUATES 0110 ; = 0120 *= $0340 ;START OF IOCB 0130 IOCB 0140 ; 0150 ICHID *= *+1 ;DEVICE HANDLER 0160 ICDNO *= *+1 ;DEVICE NUMBER 0170 ICCOM *= *+1 ;I/O COMMAND 0180 ICSTA *= *+1 ;I/O STATUS 0190 ICBAL *= *+1 ;LSB BUFFER ADDR 0200 ICBAH *= *+1 ;MSB BUFFER ADDR 0210 ICPTL *= *+1 ;LSB PUT ROUTINE 0220 ICPTH *= *+1 ;MSB PUT ROUTINE 0230 ICBLL *= *+1 ;LSB BUFFER LEN 0240 ICBLH *= *+1 ;MSB BUFFER LEN 0250 ICAX1 *= *+1 ;AUX BYTE 1 0260 ICAX2 *= *+1 ;AUX BYTE 1 0270 ; 0280 GETREC = 5 ;GET TEXT RECORD 0290 PUTREC = 9 ;PUT TEXT RECORD 0300 ; 0310 CIOV = $E456 ;CIO ENTRY VECTOR 0320 RUNAD = $02E0 ;RUN ADDRESS 0330 EOL = $9B ;END OF LINE 0340 ; 0350 ; SETUP FOR CIO 0360 ; ------------- 0370 *= $0600 0380 START LDX #0 ;IOCB 0 0390 LDA #PUTREC ;WANT OUTPUT 0400 STA ICCOM,X ;ISSUE CMD 0410 LDA #MSG&255 ;LOW BYTE OF MSG 0420 STA ICBAL,X ; INTO ICBAL 0430 LDA #MSG/256 ;HIGH BYTE 0440 STA ICBAH,X ; INTO ICBAH 0450 LDA #0 ;LENGTH OF MSG 0460 STA ICBLH,X ; HIGH BYTE 0470 LDA #$FF ;255 CHAR LENGTH 0480 STA ICBLL,X ; LOW BYTE 0490 ; 0500 ; CALL CIO TO PRINT 0510 ; ----------------- 0520 JSR CIOV ;CALL CIO 0530 RTS ;EXIT TO DOS 0540 ; 0550 ; OUR MESSAGE 0560 ; ----------- 0570 MSG .BYTE \\"HELLO WORLD!\\",EOL 0580 ; 0590 ; INIT RUN ADDRESS 0600 ; ---------------- 0610 *= RUNAD 0620 .WORD START 0630 .END These commands can be interactively entered to assemble the code, enter the debugger, run the program, then exit the debugger when it is finished: ASM BUG G600 X Legacy Shortly after Shepardson delivered Assembler Editor and Atari BASIC to Atari, Bob Shepardson, the owner, decided to return to being a one-person company. O'Brien, Laughton and Wilkinson formed their own company, Optimized Systems Software (OSS), to continue development of the Atari products. They licensed the original source code for BASIC, Assembler Editor and Atari DOS, which they had collectively written. In 1981, OSS released an improved version of Assembler Editor, EASMD on floppy disk. EASMD was replaced by MAC/65 in 1982. MAC/65 was one of the fastest assemblers on the platform. Much of the improved performance of MAC/65 is the result of tokenizing lines of code as they're entered‚Äîat is the case with Atari BASIC‚Äîto reduce the amount of work needed at assembly time. Assembler Editor continued to be available from Atari, and increased in popularity as the price dropped to US$10 or $5 in the latter half of the 1980s.

This ranges from linguistics, literature and art history, archaeology and history, the focus lying on the study of the various Celtic languages, living and extinct.Wiley, \\"\\"Celtic studies, early history of the field\\" (2006). The primary areas of focus are the six Celtic languages currently in use: Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Manx, Welsh, Cornish, and Breton. As a university subject, it is taught at a number of universities, most of them in Ireland, the United Kingdom, or France, but also in the United States, Canada, Australia, Germany, Poland, Austria and the Netherlands. History Written studies of the Celts, their cultures and their languages go back to classical Greek and Latin accounts, possibly beginning with Hecataeus in the 6th century BC and best known through such authors as Polybius, Posidonius, Pausanias, Diodorus Siculus, Julius Caesar and Strabo. Modern Celtic studies originated in the 16th and 17th centuries, when many of these classical authors were rediscovered, published and translated. Academic interest in Celtic languages grew out of comparative and historical linguistics, which was itself established at the end of the 18th century. In the 16th century, George Buchanan studied the Goidelic languages. The first major breakthrough in Celtic linguistics came with the publication of Archaeologia Britannica (1707) by the Welsh scholar Edward Lhuyd, who was the first to recognise that Gaulish, British and Irish belong to the same language family. He also published an English version of a study by Paul-Yves Pezron of Gaulish. In 1767 James Parsons published his study The Remains of Japhet, being historical enquiries into the affinity and origins of the European languages. He compared a 1000-word lexicon of Irish and Welsh and concluded that they were originally the same, then comparing the numerals in many other languages. The second big leap forwards was made when the Englishman Sir William Jones postulated that Sanskrit, Greek, Latin and many other languages including \\"the Celtic\\" derived from a common ancestral language. This hypothesis, published in The Sanscrit Language (1786), would later be hailed as the discovery of the Indo-European language family, from which grew the field of Indo-European studies. The Celtic languages were definitively linked to the Indo-European family over the course of the 19th century. Although Jones' trail-blazing hypothesis inspired numerous linguistic studies, of which Celtic languages were a part, it was not until Johann Kaspar Zeuss's monumental Grammatica Celtica (volume 1, 1851; volume 2, 1853) that any truly significant progress was made. Written in Latin, the work draws on the earliest Old Irish, Middle Welsh and other Celtic primary sources to construct a comparative grammar, which was the first to lay out a firm basis for Celtic linguistics. Among other achievements, Zeuss was able to crack the Old Irish verb. Celtic studies in the German-speaking world and the Netherlands German Celtic studies (Keltologie) is seen by many as having been established by Johann Kaspar Zeuss (1806‚Äì1856) (see above). In 1847, he was appointed professor of linguistics at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. Until the middle of the 19th century, Celtic studies progressed largely as a subfield of linguistics. Franz Bopp (1791‚Äì1867) carried out further studies in comparative linguistics to link the Celtic languages to the Proto-Indo-European language. He is credited with having finally proven Celtic to be a branch of the Indo-European language family. From 1821 to 1864, he served as a professor of oriental literature and general linguistics in Berlin. In 1896, Kuno Meyer and Ludwig Christian Stern founded the Zeitschrift f√ºr celtische Philologie (ZCP), the first academic journal solely devoted to aspects of Celtic languages and literature, and still in existence today.Busse, \\"Zeitschrift f√ºr celtische Philologie.\\" In Celtic Culture, ed. Koch: p. 1823 In the second half of the century, significant contributions were made by the Orientalist Ernst Windisch (1844‚Äì1918). He held a chair in Sanskrit at the University of Leipzig; but he is best remembered for his numerous publications in the field of Celtic studies. In 1901, the Orientalist and Celtologist Heinrich Zimmer (1851‚Äì1910) was made professor of Celtic languages at Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin, the first position of its kind in Germany. He was followed in 1911 by Kuno Meyer (1858‚Äì1919), who, in addition to numerous publications in the field, was active in the Irish independence movement. Perhaps the most important German-speaking Celticist is the Swiss scholar Rudolf Thurneysen (1857‚Äì1940). A student of Windisch and Zimmer, Thurneysen was appointed to the chair of comparative linguistics at the University of Freiburg in 1887; he succeeded to the equivalent chair at the University of Bonn in 1913. His notability arises from his work on Old Irish. For his masterwork, Handbuch des Altirischen (\\"Handbook of Old Irish\\", 1909), translated into English as A Grammar of Old Irish, he located and analysed a multitude of Old Irish manuscripts. His work is considered as the basis for all succeeding studies of Old Irish. In 1920, Julius Pokorny (1887‚Äì1970) was appointed to the chair of Celtic languages at Friedrich Wilhelm University, Berlin. Despite his support for German nationalism and Catholic faith, he was forced out of his position by the Nazis on account of his Jewish ancestry. He subsequently emigrated to Switzerland but returned to Germany in 1955 to teach at Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich. In Berlin, he was succeeded in 1937 by , a devout Nazi. After World War II, German Celtic studies took place predominantly in West Germany and Austria. Studies in the field continued at Freiburg, Bonn, Marburg, Hamburg as well as Innsbruck; however an independent professorship in Celtic studies has not been instituted anywhere. In this period, Hans Hartmann, Heinrich Wagner and Wolfgang Meid made notable contributions to the scientific understanding of the boundaries of the Celtic language area and the location of the homeland of the Celtic peoples. The Berlin chair in Celtic languages has not been occupied since 1966. Today, Celtic studies is only taught at a handful of German universities, including those of Bonn,Celtic Studies at the University of Bonn Trier,Celtic Studies and Mannheim.Current Courses the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz,Scottish Studies Centre and the Philipps University of Marburg.Celtic Studies prospectus It is also taught at the University of Vienna.Celtic Studies Only Marburg, Vienna and Bonn maintain formal programs of study, but even then usually as a subsection of comparative or general linguistics. Only Marburg offers an M.A. course specifically in Celtic Studies. No Celtic studies research has taken place in the former centres of Freiburg, Hamburg or Berlin since the 1990s. The last remaining chair in Celtic studies, that at Humboldt University of Berlin, was abolished in 1997. The only Chair of Celtic studies in Continental Europe is at Utrecht University (in the Netherlands).Keltische talen en cultuur (in Dutch)Celtic languages and culture It was established in 1923, when Celtic studies were added to the Chair of Germanic studies on the special request of its new professor A. G. van Hamel.Marc Schneiders, \\"Hamel, Anton Gerard van (1886-1945).\\" Biografisch Woordenboek van Nederland 5 (Den Haag 2002). Celtic studies in Ireland  Celtic studies are taught in universities in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. These studies cover language, history, archaeology and art. In addition, the Irish language is taught to a greater or lesser extent in schools across the island of Ireland. Scholars at the XIV International Congress of Celtic Studies, Maynooth 2011 The beginning of Celtic Studies as a university subject in Ireland might be dated to Eugene O'Curry's appointment as professor of Irish history and archaeology at the Catholic University of Ireland in 1854. Celtic Studies, either as full Celtic Studies programmes or as Irish language programmes, are now offered in the National University of Ireland, Galway, University College Cork, University College Dublin (the successor institution to the Catholic University), National University of Ireland, Maynooth, Trinity College Dublin, University of Limerick, Mary Immaculate College, Limerick, Dublin City University, Queen's University Belfast and Ulster University. The Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies (DIAS), School of Celtic Studies, is a research institution but does not award degrees. DIAS and the Royal Irish Academy are leading publishers of Celtic Studies research, including the journals Celtica and √âriu.  Celtic studies in the UK and the Isle of Man  Celtic studies are taught in universities in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. These studies cover language, history, archaeology and art. In addition, Celtic languages are taught to a greater or lesser extent in schools in Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Cornwall and the Isle of Man. The formal study of Celtic Studies at British universities in the late nineteenth century gave rise to the establishment of chairs for Sir John Rhys, first Jesus Professor of Celtic at the University of Oxford, in 1874 and for Donald MacKinnon, first Chair of Celtic at the University of Edinburgh, in 1882. Institutions in the United Kingdom that have Celtic Studies departments and courses are: the Universities of Aberdeen, Aberystwyth, Bangor, Cambridge, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Exeter (which houses the Institute of Cornish Studies), Glasgow, Oxford, Swansea, Trinity St David's, Queen's University Belfast, Ulster University, the University of the Highlands and Islands and the University of Wales, Centre for Advanced Welsh and Celtic Studies. The top five rated degree- awarding programmes/departments as of 2017 are; (1) Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic at University of Cambridge (2) Welsh and Celtic Studies at Bangor University (3) Welsh and Celtic Studies at Cardiff University (4) Celtic and Gaelic at University of Glasgow (5) Irish and Celtic Studies at Queen's University, Belfast. A major funder of UK Celtic Studies doctoral studies is the AHRC-funded Centre for Doctoral Training in the Celtic Languages, which admitted PhD students in the period 2014‚Äì2019. The CDT in Celtic Languages is administered through Celtic and Gaelic at the University of Glasgow and its director is Prof. Katherine Forsyth. Celtic studies in North America While Celtic studies programs in Canada are not as widespread as they are in Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and England, several universities offer some Celtic studies courses, while only two universities offers a full B.A. as well as graduate courses. St. Michael's College at the University of Toronto and St. Francis Xavier UniversityCeltic Studies. offers the only B.A. of its kind in Canada with a dual focus on Celtic literature and history, while the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies at the University of TorontoCeltic Studies . offers courses at a graduate level through their Centre for Medieval Studies, along with St. Francis Xavier University. Other Canadian universities which offer courses in Celtic, Scottish or Irish studies include Cape Breton University,Celtic Studies . Saint Mary's University, Halifax, Simon Fraser University, the University of Guelph and the University of Ottawa. In the United States, Harvard University is notable for their Doctorate program in Celtic studies.See Department of Celtic Languages and Literatures.

Celtic studies in France In 1804, the Acad√©mie Celtique was founded with the goal of unearthing the Gallic past of the French people. France also produced the first academic journal devoted to Celtic studies, Revue Celtique. Revue Celtique was first published in 1870 in Paris and continued until the death of its last editor, Joseph Loth, in 1934. After that point it was continued under the name √âtudes Celtiques. The University of Western Brittany (Brest) offers a two-year, an international European-Union certified master's degree course entitled ‚ÄúCeltic languages and Cultures in Contact‚Äù. It is part of the Centre for Breton and Celtic Research (CRBC). Closely linked to this MA programme, the University of Western Brittany organizes an intensive two-week Summer School in Breton Language and Cultural Heritage Studies every year in June. This Summer School is also sponsored by the CRBC and welcomes scholars from around the world with an interest in the Celtic (and minority) languages and cultures to study Breton, the least known of the living Celtic languages. Celtic studies elsewhere Celtic studies are also taught at other universities elsewhere in Europe, including the Charles University in Prague (Czech Republic),Centre for Irish Studies.

It consists of two main islands, Likoma and Chizumulu. It is a district in the Northern Region of Malawi. The capital is Likoma.  History  Whereas Portuguese missionaries colonized the interior of Angola and Mozambique in the 19th century, Anglican missionaries colonized Malawi, including the islands in Lake Malawi. In 1954, an agreement was made to make the middle of Lake Malawi the border between Malawi and neighboring Mozambique; however, Likoma and Chizumulu islands were kept as part of Malawi.  Culture  The Likoma people are mostly fishermen and speak a traditional Nkamanga language. There are mostly small villages on both islands, with the exception of Mbamba with an Anglican cathedral. There are few cars but plenty of four-wheelers, creating a unique blend of tourism and local culture.

Mair (ed), Sino-Platonic Papers, No. 230, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, University of Pennsylvania Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations, p. 15, ISSN 2157-9687. The object has many Hellenistic period features, including a Greek centaur and diadem, linking it to the Greco- Bactrian Kingdom (formed after the conquest of the Achaemenid Empire by Alexander the Great of Macedon and establishment of the Seleucid Empire). It may represent a Yuezhi soldier, in red jacket and trousers, from the 1st century CE. Description The full tapestry is 48 cm wide and 230 cm long.Hansen 2012, p. 285, fn. 6 The centaur fragment is 45 cm by 55 cm, warrior's face fragment is 48 cm by 52 cm.Zhao 2004, p. 194 The recovered tapestry only constitutes the left decorative border of what would be a much bigger wall hanging. Made of wool,Wood 2002, p. 37; Zhao 2004, p. 194 it comprises 24 threads of various colours. The tapestry depicts a man with Caucasoid features,Time Life 1993, p. 81; Wood 2002, p. 37; Hansen 2012, p. 202 including blue eyes,Time Life 1993, p. 81 and a centaur.Time Life 1993, p. 81; Wood 2002, p. 37; Hansen 2012, pl. 13 image + text, p. 202 If lost fabric is accounted for, the soldier would be about six times as tall as the centaur.Zhao 2004, p.195 The subject is identified as a warrior by the spear he is holding in his hand as well as a dagger tucked on his waist.Zhao 2004, p. 194; Hansen 2012, p. 202 He wears a tunic with rosette motifs. His headband could be a diadem, a symbol of kingship in the Hellenistic world ‚Äì and represented on Macedonian and other ancient Greek coinage. The centaur is playing a horn while wearing a cape and a hood.Hansen 2012, pl. 13 text; Zhao 2004, p. 194 Surrounding him is a diamond-shaped floral ornament. Due to heavy looting at the location, the dating of the material is uncertain. It has been assigned dates from the 3rd century BC to the 4th century AD.Hansen 2012, pl. 13 textImage gallery for the Secrets of the Silk Road exhibition at the Penn MuseumWood 2002, p. 255 Discovery The centaur, with floral decorations. The tapestry was excavated in 1983‚Äì1984 at an ancient burial ground in Sampul (Shanpula), 30 km east of Hotan (Khotan), in the Tarim Basin.Wood 2002, p. 37, p. 255; Zhao 2004, p. 194; Hansen 2012, p. 201 The tapestry was, curiously, fashioned into a pair of man's trousers (all the other trousers found in Sampul had no decoration).Hansen 2012, pl. 13 text, p. 202 Origin It is uncertain where the tapestry was made, although the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom in Central Asia has been suggested to be a possibility. The technique used for the tapestry, with more than 24 threads of different colours, is a typically western one. The centaur's cape and hood are a central Asian modification of the Greek motif.Zhao 2004, p. 194; Hansen 2012, pl. 13 text The fact that he plays a horn also distinguishes him from the Greek prototypes. Flower diamond motif on the warrior's lapel are of central Asian origin. Certain motifs, particularly the animal head on the soldier's dagger, suggest that the tapestry originated in the kingdom of Parthia in northern Iran.Hansen 2012, p. 202 Rome has also been proposed as a possible source. Another suggestion is that it is locally made as Tang annal New Book of Tang mentioned that local people of Khotan were good at textile and tapestry work when Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141-87 BC) opened the Silk Road to Khotan during the first century BC. The tapestry may have been made roughly a century before the Han Chinese conquest of the Tarim Basin under Wudi. Hellenistic tapestries have also been found in Loulan by Aurel Stein, indicating a cultural link between Loulan and Khotan. Significance The existence of this tapestry tends to suggest that contacts between the Hellenistic kingdoms of Central Asia and the Tarim Basin, at the edge of the Chinese world occurred from around the 3rd century BC. Exhibition history The tapestry is on permanent display in the Xinjiang Museum, √úr√ºmqi, China.

It is a transit point, with roads leading to all areas of Malawi and Mozambique to the east. In fact, the border is not far once you cross the Shire River. To the north, the road bifurcates into the Salima or Monkey Bay roads. To the west, is the hilly region of Dedza. Traveling south, the road climbs up the Machinga escarpment to Zomba, the former colonial capital of Nyasaland, and from there to Malawi's commercial hub of Blantyre (named after David Livingstone's home town near Glasgow). It is fiercely hot in summer and ambient in winter. It is on the flood-plain for Lake Malawi (formerly Lake Nyassa). The lake is the third largest and most southerly in the Rift Valley lake system (the others being Lake Victoria and Lake Tanganyika), and is unofficially known as the Lake of Stars. The lake was named by David Livingston as he discovered it on September 18, 1859, for the effect of the reflection of the sun on the water's surface. It is also known as the Calendar Lake as it is approx long and 52 wide. While a beautiful area, the Mangochi area has been decimated by Africa's nemesis - AIDS. Couple that with poverty, climate change and a severe lack of infrastructure and the scenario is desperate. It is a very beautiful place, full of natural minerals, loads of fish, for example chambo, and of course Nkopola Lodge, Sun and Sand Palm Beach and many more. In fact there are numerous lovely lodges along the Mangochi Road other than Nkopola Lodge. One of the finest is Club Makokola (Club Mac). There are beautiful tropical fish, mostly cichlids, to be seen while swimming. There are also many fabulous bird rookeries along the lake with fish eagles, the national bird of Malawi, a member of the same genus as the American bald eagle.

The WLC model is the continuous version of the Kratky‚ÄìPorod model.  Model elements  250x250px The WLC model envisions a continuously flexible isotropic rod. This is in contrast to the freely-jointed chain model, which is only flexible between discrete freely hinged segments. The model is particularly suited for describing stiffer polymers, with successive segments displaying a sort of cooperativity: nearby segments are roughly aligned. At room temperature, the polymer adopts a smoothly curved conformation; at T = 0 K, the polymer adopts a rigid rod conformation. For a polymer of maximum length L_0, parametrize the path of the polymer as s \\\\in(0,L_0). Allow \\\\hat t(s) to be the unit tangent vector to the chain at point s, and \\\\vec r(s) to be the position vector along the chain, as shown to the right. Then: :\\\\hat t(s) \\\\equiv \\\\frac {\\\\partial \\\\vec r(s) }{\\\\partial s} and the end-to-end distance \\\\vec R = \\\\int_{0}^{L_0}\\\\hat t(s) ds . The energy associated with the bending of the polymer can be written as: E = \\\\frac {1}{2}k_B T \\\\int_{0}^{L_0} P \\\\cdot \\\\left (\\\\frac {\\\\partial^2 \\\\vec r(s) }{\\\\partial s^2}\\\\right )^{2} ds where P is the polymer's characteristic persistence length, k_B is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature. At finite temperatures, the end-to end distance of the polymer will be significantly shorter than the maximum length L_0. This is caused by thermal fluctuations, which result in a coiled, random configuration of the undisturbed polymer. The polymer's orientation correlation function can then be solved for, and it follows an exponential decay with decay constant 1/P: \\\\langle\\\\hat t(s) \\\\cdot \\\\hat t(0)\\\\rangle=\\\\langle \\\\cos \\\\; \\\\theta (s)\\\\rangle = e^{-s/P}\\\\, Mean squared end-to-end distance as a function of persistence length.

This can be used to show that a Kuhn segment is equal to twice the persistence length of a worm-like chain. In the limit of L_0 \\\\ll P, then \\\\langle R^{2} \\\\rangle = L_0^2, and the polymer displays rigid rod behavior. The figure to the right shows the crossover from flexible to stiff behavior as the persistence length increases. Comparison between the worm-like chain model and experimental data from the stretching of Œª-DNA.  Biological relevance  Experimental data from the stretching of Lambda phage DNA is shown to the right, with force measurements determined by analysis of Brownian fluctuations of a bead attached to the DNA. A persistence length of 51.35 nm and a contour length of 1318 nm were used for the model, which is depicted by the solid line. Other biologically important polymers that can be effectively modeled as worm-like chains include: * double-stranded DNA (persistence length 40-50 nm) and RNA (persistence length 64 nm) * single- stranded DNA (persistence length 4 nm) * unstructured RNA (persistence length 2 nm) * unstructured proteins (persistence length 0.6-0.7 nm) * microtubules (persistence length 0.52 cm) *filamentous bacteriophage  Stretching worm- like chain polymers  Upon stretching, the accessible spectrum of thermal fluctuations reduces, which causes an entropic force acting against the external elongation. This entropic force can be estimated from considering the total energy of the polymer: H = H_{\\\\rm elastic} + H_{\\\\rm external}= \\\\frac {1}{2}k_B T \\\\int_{0}^{L_0} P \\\\cdot \\\\left (\\\\frac {\\\\partial^2 \\\\vec r(s) }{\\\\partial s^2}\\\\right )^{2} ds - xF. Here, the contour length is represented by L_0, the persistence length by P, the extension is represented by x, and external force is represented by F. Laboratory tools such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) and optical tweezers have been used to characterize the force-dependent stretching behavior of biological polymers. An interpolation formula that approximates the force-extension behavior with about 15% relative error is: :\\\\frac {FP} {k_{B}T} = \\\\frac {1}{4} \\\\left ( 1 - \\\\frac {x} {L_0} \\\\right )^{-2} - \\\\frac {1}{4} + \\\\frac {x}{L_0} A more accurate approximation for the force-extension behavior with about 0.01% relative error is: :\\\\frac {FP} {k_{B}T} = \\\\frac {1}{4} \\\\left ( 1 - \\\\frac {x} {L_0} \\\\right )^{-2} - \\\\frac {1}{4} + \\\\frac {x}{L_0} + \\\\sum_{i=2}^{i=7} \\\\alpha_i \\\\left( \\\\frac{x}{L_0} \\\\right) ^i , with \\\\alpha_2 = -0.5164228, \\\\alpha_3 = -2.737418, \\\\alpha_4 = 16.07497 , \\\\alpha_5 = -38.87607 , \\\\alpha_6 = 39.49944 , \\\\alpha_7 = -14.17718.  Extensible worm-like chain model  The elastic response from extension cannot be neglected: polymers elongate due to external forces. This enthalpic compliance is accounted for the material parameter K_0, and the system yields the following Hamiltonian for significantly extended polymers: H = H_{\\\\rm elastic}+H_{\\\\rm enthalpic}+H_{\\\\rm external} = \\\\frac {1}{2}k_B T \\\\int_{0}^{L_0} P \\\\cdot \\\\left (\\\\frac {\\\\partial ^2\\\\vec r(s) }{\\\\partial s^2}\\\\right )^{2} ds + \\\\frac {1}{2}\\\\frac {K_0}{L_0} x^{2} - xF , This expression contains both the entropic term, which describes changes in the polymer conformation, and the enthalpic term, which describes the stretching of the polymer due to the external force. Several approximations for the force-extension behavior have been put forward, depending on the applied external force. These approximations are made for stretching DNA in physiological conditions (near neutral pH, ionic strength approximately 100 mM, room temperature), with stretch modulus around 1000 pN. For the low-force regime (F < about 10 pN), the following interpolation formula was derived: \\\\frac {FP} {k_{B}T} = \\\\frac {1}{4} \\\\left ( 1 - \\\\frac {x} {L_0} + \\\\frac {F}{K_0} \\\\right )^{-2} - \\\\frac {1}{4} + \\\\frac {x}{L_0} - \\\\frac {F}{K_0}. For the higher-force regime, where the polymer is significantly extended, the following approximation is valid: x = L_0 \\\\left ( 1 - \\\\frac {1} {2} \\\\left ( \\\\frac {k_{B}T}{FP} \\\\right )^{1/2} + \\\\frac {F}{K_0}\\\\right ) . As for the case wihtout extension, a more accurate formula was derived : \\\\frac {FP} {k_{B}T} = \\\\frac {1}{4} \\\\left ( 1 - l \\\\right )^{-2} - \\\\frac {1}{4} + l + \\\\sum_{i=2}^{i=7} \\\\alpha_i \\\\left( l \\\\right) ^i , with l = \\\\frac{x}{L_0} - \\\\frac{F}{K_0} . The \\\\alpha_i coefficients are the same as the one of the above described formula for the WLC model without elasticity.

In 1965-1967, on leave from Edinburgh, he established a Department of Psychiatry in the University of Western Australia. He became a Foundation Fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists in 1971, and in 1977 was appointed to a personal Chair in the University of Edinburgh. In the 1980s in research with Kirstine Adam, he reported that the sleeping drug triazolam (Halcion), when taken nightly caused adverse mental effects by day. This led on to 1991 when triazolam was banned in the United Kingdom because, as the Committee on Safety of Medicines said after studying further unpublished research by the Upjohn Company of Kalamazoo (Halcion's manufacturers), \\"triazolam causes frequent and disabling psychiatric adverse reactions at doses of 0.5 and 1mg when used in a population of young and middle-aged patients with no mental illness\\". (The Daily Telegraph. 2 October 1991). In 1992, the Upjohn Company of Kalamazoo, the makers of Halcion, sued him in London for libel and he countersued in a 62-day trial.

He also served as the military commander (spahbed) of Khwarasan under Khosrow I and his successor Hormizd IV (). According to Persian and Arabic sources, Bozorgmehr was a man of \\"exceptional wisdom and sage counsels\\" and later became a characterisation of the expression. His name appears in several important works in Persian literature, most notably in the Shahnameh (\\"The Book of Kings\\"). The historian Arthur Christensen has suggested that Bozorgmehr was the same person as Borzuya, but historigraphical studies of post-Sasanian Persian literature, as well as linguistic analysis show otherwise. However, the word \\"Borzuya\\" can sometimes be considered a shortened form of Bozorgmehr.  Name  The name of the Bozorgmehr is the New Persian variant of Middle Persian Wuzurgmihr ƒ´ B≈çkhtagƒÅn, which was later transformed in Arabic as Ab≈´zarjmehr, Bozorjmehr, or B≈´zorjmehr. The last variant was used by Ferdowsi in the Shahnameh (\\"The Book of Kings\\"). Etymologically the latter is a corruption of Burzmihr or DƒÅd-Burzmihr, also reported as Zarmihr. Its proper version was DƒÅdburzmihr, with B≈´rz≈´mihr being the original variant in ancient engravings. The name is attested as Dadburzmihr (\\"given by the high Mihr\\") in a seal, a theophoric name that emphasizes the Mihr worship of Bozorgmehrs clan, the Karenids. The -i B≈çkhtagƒÅn suffix is a patronymic name meaning \\"son of Bokhtagan\\", a title held by Bozorgmehrs father.  Background  Bozorgmehr is first mentioned in 498, as one of the nine sons of the powerful nobleman Sukhra. He belonged to the House of Karen, one of the Seven Great Houses of Iran, which was descended from the Arsacid prince Karen. The Karen family claimed descent from the legendary Pishdadian shah Manuchehr, and were based in Nihavand in Media. After the defeat and death of the Sasanian shah Peroz I () at the battle of Herat, Sukhra became the de facto ruler of Iran. He was eventually defeated and executed by Kavad I, which resulted in the Karen family being heavily weakened, with many of its members being exiled to the regions of Tabaristan and Zabulistan, which was away from the Sasanian court in Ctesiphon. In 496, Kavad I was deposed and imprisoned due to his support of the Mazdakite movement, and also for having Sukhra executed.  Career  Bozorgmehr challenges the Indian envoy to a game of chess. After Kavad I had reclaimed the Sasanian throne from his younger brother Jamasp in 498, he appointed Bozorgmehr as his minister (wuzurg framadƒÅr). During his tenure, Bozorgmehr persuaded Kavad to stop taxation on fruits and grain from the peasantry. An early reference to Bozorgmehr is found in the AydƒÅgƒÅr ƒ´ Wuzurgmihr, in which he is called an argbed‚Äîa high-ranking title in the Sasanian and Parthian periods. Among other sources, later mention of him is made in the Shahnameh and in al-Tha'alibi‚Äôs Ghurar and al-Masudi‚Äôs Mur≈´j al- Dhahab. During the reign of Kavad I's son and successor, Khosrow I (), Bozorgmehr continued his tenure as minister of the shah. He further rose to prominence after being appointed as military commander (spahbed) of the kust (frontier region) of Khorasan (Khwarasan) by Khosrow I, who reportedly regretted Kavad I's approach to the family. During the reign of Khosrow I's son Hormizd IV (), Bozorgmehr continued to serve as spahbed of the Khorasan. Two seals of Bozorgmehr has been found; both of them whom Bozorgmehr emphasizes his Parthian ancestry by claiming to be a Parthian aspbed (aspbed-i pahlaw). According to Ferdinand Justi, Bozorgmehr was later executed by the order of Hormizd IV. His execution probably lead to the legendary story of the royal resentment reported in various versions by al-Masudi, Ferdowsi, and al- Tha'alibi. The versions of Ferdowsi and al-Tha'alibi, which link Bozorgmehr with the reign of Khosrow I, he was reportedly pardoned by the shah, who was well-known for his fairness. In the version of al-Masudi, Bozorgmehr was linked with the reign of Khosrow II, where no mention of his execution is made. Bozorgmehrs descendants continued to remain active in Iran, with one of them, Adhar Valash, ruling Tabaristan and Gorgan under the last Sasanian shah, Yazdegerd III (). His grandson, Valash, ruled Tabaristan from 665 to 673.  Works  Several Middle Persian treatises were written by Bozorgmehr. Most famous is the WizƒÅri≈°n ƒ´ ƒçatrang (\\"Treatise on Chess\\"), also known as the Chatrang Nama (\\"Book of Chess\\"). As well as; AyƒÅdgƒÅr ƒ´ Wuzurgmihr ƒ´ B≈çxtagƒÅn, KetƒÅb al-Zabarj (the original version a commentary on Vettius Valens‚Äôs Astrologica), KetƒÅb MehrƒÅzƒÅd Jo≈°nas (\\"Book of MehrƒÅ·∏èar Jo≈°nas\\") and the ·∫íafar- nƒÅma (\\"Book of Victory\\", a book written in Middle Persian, that was translated into New Persian by Avicenna.

The total land area is 2,363 km2, representing three percent of the total land area of Malawi. The capital is Zomba. Geography Zomba District is bounded on the north by Machinga District, on the east by Mozambique, and on the south by Phalombe, Mulanje, and Chiradzulu districts, on the southwest by Blantyre district, and on the northeast by Balaka District. The Shire River forms the northwestern boundary of the district, and the northwestern portion of the district lies in the Shire River Valley, a portion of the East African Rift. The Shire Highlands run from north to south through the district, including the Zomba Plateau. The highlands form the divide between the Shire River basin and the basin of Lake Chilwa. The Phalombe Plain lies east of the highlands and west and south of Lake Chilwa. The central and eastern portions of the district lie in the closed basin of Lake Chilwa, and several small rivers drain from the surrounding highlands into the lake. The Domasi River forms part of the northern boundary of the district. The Phalombe River and its tributary the Namadzi form the southern boundary of the district, separating it from Phalombe, Mulanje, and Chiradzulu districts. The Likangala River and its tributary the Thondwe River drain the central portion of the district eastwards into lake Chilwa. Lake Chilwa's extent varies with rainfall and evaporation, and the lake is surrounded by broad seasonal wetlands. Demographics The district has a total population of 746,724 (2018) resulting in a population density of 316 persons per km2, more than half (52.6%) of whom are 18 years or younger. The annual population growth rate over the last decade was two percent. The main ethnic groups are Mang'anja/Nyanja, Yao and Lomwe. Chinyanja is the native language spoken by most of the inhabitants, although other languages like Chiyao and Chilomwe are also spoken. The two dominant religions are Christianity (78%) and Islam (20%).

Other crops produced include rice, cassava, sweet potato, groundnuts, beans and pigeon peas. Husbandry is still underdeveloped; nevertheless cattle, poultry, goats, sheep, pigs and rabbits are raised for meat production in Zomba, with poultry being the most common. Zomba on the other hand is one of the few districts with well-spread pond-fishing. There are around 2,600 farmers engaged in aquaculture, operating more than 5,000 ponds and producing as much as 757 tonnes of fish annually. In addition, Lake Chilwa continues to be the main source of fish in the district, with an annual catchment of more than 5,000 tonnes. Small and medium-scale businesses dominate the district's non agro-based economy, with general retail accounting for the gross of sales. Employment has increased to almost 97% of the total adult (15+) population, resulting in historically low unemployment. Services, general labour, and professional and technical groups are the dominant occupation groups. Ecology The district extends across four ecoregions. The Zambezian and mopane woodlands occupy the warm, dry valley of the Shire River in the northeast of the district. The South Malawi montane forest- grassland mosaic covers the cooler and moister Shire Highlands. Zambezian and mopane woodlands and Eastern miombo woodlands extend across the Phalombe Plain. Zambezian flooded grasslands surround Lake Chilwa. Most of the district's native forests have been cleared for agriculture or plantations of introduced pines (Pinus patula) and eucalyptus. Tourism Tourism plays an increasing role in the district's economy. Attractions include the Zomba Plateau and Lake Chilwa, historical relics and the natural environment of the district. Health Health services are provided mainly at health posts, clinics, health centres and hospitals. In addition, many people get medical treatment from traditional practitioners and traditional birth attendants. The crude birth rate for the district is estimated at 48.1 births per 1,000 Inhabitants. The total fertility rate stands at 5.3 children per woman. The infant mortality rate is 84 deaths per 1,000 live births and child mortality (14.4%) is among the highest in the country. Infrastructure Almost four- fifths of all households (79.6%) have access to safe drinking water, while access to sanitation facilities is still at 59%. Methods of refuse disposal include burning, dust bins, rubbish pits, random littering and, mainly for organic waste, integrating into garden and composite pits. Education Education in Zomba District is offered from pre-school, primary, secondary and tertiary levels to adult literacy classes and vocational training. The services are provided by the government, religious institutions and private individuals. The district has experienced a sharp increase in school enrolment. Primary school net enrolment is currently at 87.2% against the country rate of 80.0%. However, the education sector in Zomba at all levels continues to face a number of challenges, including teacher qualification, shortages in the total number of teacher and student accommodations, lack of or dilapidated classrooms and lack of teaching materials. Transportation Zomba District is comparatively well connected. The main road passing through the district is the M3 road (Blantyre-Zomba-Lilongwe). The Zomba Phalombe road is under construction. Earth roads comprise many of the other types of roads connecting different places within the district. Bicycles and matola (hitch- hiking) are the most common means of transport, followed by regular buses and minibuses.

A keen businesswoman, she financed many of her husband's political campaigns and important buildings like the Pitti Palace. She ruled as regent of Florence during his frequent absences and founded many Jesuit churches. She is credited with being the first modern first lady or consort. Childhood Eleanor's father, Pedro √Ålvarez de Toledo, Viceroy of Naples. Eleanor was born in Alba de Tormes, Salamanca, Spain, on 11 January 1522. She was the second daughter of Pedro √Ålvarez de Toledo, Viceroy of Naples, and Maria Osorio, 2nd Marquise of Villafranca. Her father was the lieutenant-governor of Emperor Charles V and brother of the Duke of Alba. Through his side, Eleanor was the third cousin of the Emperor since their great-grandmothers were daughters of Fadrique Enr√≠quez de Mendoza, grandson of King Alfonso XI of Castile.Cesati, p. 75. In May 1534, two years her father's appointment as Viceroy of Naples, Eleanor, her mother, and siblings joined him in Italy. The children were brought up in the strict and closed surrondings of the Spanish viceregal court. 13-years-old Eleanor seems to not have attracted much attention, except for the furtives glances of the visiting page Cosimo de' Medici in 1535 when he accompanied his cousin Alessandro, Duke of Florence, on a visit to Naples. Marriage Cosimo I de' Medici, her husband. Three years later, Cosimo, now Duke of Florence, was searching for a wife who could help strengthen his political position since the Medici were still new to their ducal status. He initially asked to marry Margaret of Austria, illegitimate daughter of Charles V and Alessandro's widow, but she displayed enormous reluctance at the idea in order to serve her father's own plans for her. Not wanting to antagonize Cosimo though, the Emperor offered him one of the daughters of the rich Viceroy of Naples. The bride would provide the Medici with a powerful link to Spain, at that time ultimately in control of Florence, offering the opportunity to show sufficient loyalty and trust to Spain in order that its troops would retire from the province. Remembering Eleanor, Cosimo firmly refused the Viceroy's first offer of his eldest and duller daughter, Isabella. Her father agreed and provided a large amount of money on Eleanor as dowry. Eleanore and Cosimo were married by proxy on 29 March 1539. No sooner was the agreement reached than the couple began to correspond. In May, Florencian agent Jacobo de' Medici was in Naples and informed the ducal secretary, Pierfrancesco Riccio, that \\"The Lady Duchess says she is happy and filled to the brim with satisfaction, and I want to assure of this.\\" Riccio then added that when Eleanor received letters from her fianc√© \\"she took pride in having understood them on her own, without anyone's help.\\" She was quickly working on her reading knowledge of Italian, something she probably hadn't been interested in developing while living in a Spanish court. On 11 June, 17 years-old Eleanor set sail from Naples, accompanied by her brother Garcia with seven galleys following. They arrived at Livorno on the morning of June 22. That same morning, she left for Pisa and halfway through, met Cosimo. After a short stay in Pisa, the couple left for Florence, stopping for a few days at the Poggio a Caiano. June 29, 1539 marked Eleanor and Cosimo's grandiose entrance from the Porta al Prato to the Church of San Lorenzo for their wedding in a grand, lavish celebration. Painter Agnolo Bronzino provided festive decor, the first instance for artistic renewal in Florence after the disastrous Siege in 1529-1530. This showed the new Duke's policy of \\"creating an organic relationship between artists and the principality.\\" The couple had a peaceful domestic life: surprisingly for the era, her husband was faithful throughout their long marriage. The ducal couple served as an example of a traditional couple, which served to strengthen Cosimo's various reforms and separate their association with the former Duke, who was assassinated by another member of the Medici family without leaving legitimate heirs and consolidating the dynasty's strength in Tuscany after years of politically damaging speculation about his excesses and sexual irregularities. He was reputed to have been the son of a black serving woman and Cardinal Giulio de' Medici, later Pope Clement VII, illegitimate son of Giuliano de' Medici, who was assassinated in the Pazzi Conspiracy against the reigning family. Before her marriage, the Medici line had been in danger of extinction. Both Eleanor and Cosimo heard reports of their children's progress and offered directions for their education, living arrangements, and clothing. The birth of male heirs and daughters who could be married into other ruling families inaugurated another era of stability and strength in Tuscany. Their royal ancestors provided the Medici with the blue blood they had lacked and began the process of placing them on equal footing with other European sovereigns. The couple had eleven children, though only five sons and three daughters reached maturity: *Maria (April 3, 1540 ‚Äì November 19, 1557): Engaged to Alfonso II d'Este, but died before the marriage. *Franceso (March 25, 1541 ‚Äì October 19, 1587): Succeeded his father as Grand Duke of Tuscany. *Isabella (31 August 1542 ‚Äì 16 July 1576): Married, Paolo Giordano I Orsini, Duke of Bracciano. *Giovanni (28 September 1543 ‚Äì November 1562): Became Bishop of Pisa and cardinal. *Lucrezia (7 June 1545 ‚Äì 21 April 1561): Married Alfonso II d'Este, Duke of Ferrara and Modena. *Pietro (10 August 1546 ‚Äì 10 June 1547): Known as \\"Pedricco\\". Died in infancy. *Garzia (5 July 1547 ‚Äì 12 December 1562): Died of malaria at the age of 15. *Antonio (July 1, 1548 ‚Äì July 1548): Died in infancy. *Ferdinando (30 July 1549 ‚Äì 17 February 1609): Succeeded his brother as Grand Duke of Tuscany. *Anna (19 March 1553 ‚Äì 6 August 1553): Died in infancy. *Pietro (3 June 1554 ‚Äì 25 April 1604): Murdered his wife and cousin, Eleonora di Garzia di Toledo, because of infidelity. Duchess of Florence Eleanor of Toledo with her son Giovanni by Agnolo Bronzino, 1545. It is considered the first state portrait to depict a ruler's wife with his heir. The picture was intended to demonstrate the wealth, domesticity and continuity of the Medici.Landini, pp. 70‚Äì74. Eleanor's high profile in Florence as ducal consort was initially a public relations exercise promoted by her husband, who needed to reassure the public of the stability and respectability of not only his family, but the new reign. Her motto was cum pudore laeta fecunditas (meaning \\"happy fruitfulness with chastity\\"), making reference to the plentiful harvests of her lands, her marital fidelity, and numerous children. Eventually, Eleanor gained considerable influence in Florence through her involvement in politics, to the point that Cosimo often consulted with her. So great was his trust in her political skills that in his frequent absences, the Duke made his wife regent, a station which established her position as more than just a pretty bearer of children. Eleanor ruled during Cosimo's military campaigns in Genoa in 1541 and 1543, his illness from 1544 to 1545, and again at times when the war for the conquest of Siena (1551‚Äì1554) required either his absence or greater focus on military matters. =Political Influence= Eleanor was very keen and interested in business, especially regarding agriculture. She owned great tracts of grain crops and livestock, such as beekeeping and silkworms raising. An additional business she took part was mining. Her harvests were plentiful and products were shipped as far as Spain. The Duchess managed and sold her goods wisely, which helped to considerably expand and increase the profitability of the vast Medici estates. Through her charitable interests, the lot of the peasantry obtained many economical benefits as well. Although Florentines initially thought of her as a Spanish barbarian and enemy to her husband's homeland, Eleanor not only made solid donations to Florentine charities but to their policies. She financially supported Cosimo's policies to restore the duchy's independence from foreign lands and helped people unable to gain audiences with the Duke realize that through the Duchess their causes could at least be pleaded. A pious woman, Eleanor made donations to and visited several convents. In 1547, Juan Polanco, sent by Ignatius de Loyola to preach in Pistoia, approached the Duchess and asked for her patronage to founding a Jesuit college. She refused Polanco's petition, but later undertook negotiations with Diego La√≠nez that eventually led to the first Jesuit school in Florence. La√≠nez eventually gained her affection, to the point that she became a constant intercessor to Cosimo on the order's behalf and founded many new churches in the city. However, she didn't completely embraced the entire Jesuit society nor their devotion. =Patronage of Arts= A lunette painted in 1599 by Giusto Utens, depicts the Palazzo Pitti before its extensions, with the amphitheatre and the Boboli Gardens behind. Detail of a Bronzino fresco in the Cappella di Eleonora. Like her husband, Eleanor was a notable patron to many of the most artists of the age like Agnolo Bronzino, Giorgio Vasari, and Niccol√≤ Tribolo and very notable buildings still standing today. Eleanor's private chapel in the Palazzo Vecchio was decorated by Bronzino. From 1559 to 1564, she commissioned Vasari to make a new fresco in her apartments about famous women whose, in his words, actions have equalled or surpassed men, such as Queen Esther, Penelope, and Florentine heroine Gualdrada. It is thought that the redecorations were a concerted effort on the middle age Eleanor's part to reshape her public persona away from fecundity and towards other her virtues - wisdom, valour and prudence. In the earlier part of her marriage, the Medici family lived in Florence's Via Larga at what is now the Palazzo Medici-Riccardi and later at the Palazzo Vecchio. Raised in the luxurious courts of Naples, Eleanor purchased the Pitti Palace across the Arno river in 1549 as a summer retreat for the Medici. In 1550, she commissioned and supervised Tribolo to create the Pitti's famous Boboli Gardens, which possess openness and expansive view unconventional for its time. The gardens were very lavish and no access was allowed to anyone outside the immediate Medici. Part of Eleanor's final will and testament was the creation and funding of the prestigious but exclusive convent Santissima Concezione, the daughter house of one of her favorite convents, Le Murate.K. J. P. Lowe, Nuns‚Äô Chronicles and Convent Culture in Renaissance and Counter-Reformation Italy, (Cambridge University Press, 2003), pp. 219-20. It was built around the Sale del Papa of the prominent Dominican monastery Santa Maria Novella, which once functioned as quarters for visiting popes. Personality and appearance 1543 portrait of Eleanor de Toledo by Agnolo Bronzino. Contemporary accounts of Eleanor give a different picture than her cold, stern portraits might lead people to assume. Much like her husband, the Duchess was realistic, practical and determinated, quietly but surely making important actions. Though she was sick much of her adult life, Eleanor was considered very charming, loved to gamble* https://web.archive.org/web/20050922030351/http://www.umich.edu/~newsinfo/MT/02/Spr02/mt14s02.html Women who ruled] and was a devoted traveler, moving endlessly throughout her palazzi and villas. Although she didn't support the Spaniards gaining control of Florence, Eleanor showed pride of her birthplace and preferred to write in Spanish than Italian, which sometimes causes communication problems in letters with her husband. Jesuits sent Spanish priests to negotiate with the Duchess, as \\"she doesn't wish to speak with any of our men who isn't Spanish.\\" Eleanor was remembered for her majestic facial features shown in portraits. She was very fashion-consciousCOX-REARICK, JANET. \\"Power-Dressing at the Courts of Cosimo De' Medici and Fran√ßois I: The 'Moda Alla Spagnola' of Spanish Consorts El√©onore D'Autriche and Eleonora Di Toledo\\".

On the other hand, this may not have been done out of simple vanity. 21-century forensic examinations revealed she had a significant calcium deficiency, a consequence of many and frequent pregnancies. This medical condition may have caused her much ill health, dental pain, and a poor overall appearance.Tales From The Crypt, CBS News. Death Cardinale Giovanni de' Medici Adriaen Haelwegh, Garzia dei Medici. National Gallery of Art, Washington. 40-year-old Eleanor and two of her sons, 16-year-old Giovanni and 19-year-old Garzia, got sick from malaria while travelling to Pisa in 1562. Her sons died before her and within weeks of each other. Weakened by her pulmonary tuberculosis, Eleanor died after on 17 December, in the presence of her disconsolate husband and a Jesuit confessor. Her funeral was held in 28 December, before she was buried in the Medici crypts in the Basilica of San Lorenzo. For centuries after her death, the myth pervaded that Garcia had murdered his brother Giovanni following a dispute in 1562. Cosimo was said to then murdered Garcia with his own sword and the distraught Eleanor died a week later from grief. The truth, proven by modern-day exhumations and forensic science, was that Eleanor and her sons, as the Medici family had always claimed, died together from malaria. Legacy Early, tinted 20th-century photograph of the famous Palazzo Pitti, La Residenza Reale which Eleanor bought for the Medici family. Since her death, historians have tended to overlook Eleanor's importance to Florentine history and today she is often thought of as just another consort. This is probably due to the numerous portraits painted of her extravagance dresses and the bad press she received from her Florentine subjects because she was Spanish. The rebuilding of the Pitti Palace was only partially completed at the time of Eleanor's death, but eventually became the principal residence of the grand rulers of Tuscany.Giusti, p. 11. The palazzo is now the largest museum complex in Florence as later generations amassed paintings, jewelry and luxurious possessions. Her iconal dress is today in the care of Pitti's Galleria del Costume. Eleanor's founding of Santissima Concezione contributed to her legacy since the convent's artistic commissions further reinforce the fact that she was the patron.

Although he was militarily successful, he died early as a victim of political intrigue. His younger brother Liu Xiu, however, would eventually found the Eastern Han Dynasty (as Emperor Guangwu). Family background Liu Yan was the sixth generation descendant of Emperor Jing of the former (or Western) Han. He was the son of Liu Qin (), magistrate of Nandun county (). Liu Qin was the son of Liu Hui (), vice governor in charge of military affairs for Julu Commandery (). Liu Hui was the son of Liu Wai (), governor of Yulin commandery (). Liu Wai was the son of Liu Mai (), known posthumously as Marquess Jie of Chongling (). Liu Mai was the son of Liu Fa (), known posthumously as Prince Ding of Changsha (). The prince of Changsha was a brother of Emperor Wu, a Han emperor, and he was the son of Emperor Jing. Liu Qin was married to the daughter of Fan Chong (), and they had three sons: Liu Yan, Liu Zhong (), and Liu Xiu. Liu Qin died early, so the brothers were raised by their uncle Liu Liang (). Liu Yan was ambitious, and ever since Wang Mang usurped the Han throne in 9 AD establishing Xin Dynasty, Liu Yan was constantly considering starting a rebellion to restore the Han Dynasty. Liu Xiu, in contrast, was a careful man who was content to be a farmer. Rebellion against Xin In 22 AD, with rebellions breaking out across the empire against Wang Mang's rule, Liu Yan prepared his rebellion. He planned, along with his brothers, and Li Tong () and his cousin Li Yi (), to kidnap the governor for Nanyang Commandery (modern Nanyang, Henan) and call for the people of the commandery to join him. When the young men of Chongling were told about the planned rebellion, they hesitated in joining until they were told that Liu Xiu was also involved. However, the news of the planned rebellion leaked out, and Li Tong and Li Yi barely escaped with their lives (but their family was slaughtered). Liu Yan changed his plan and persuaded two branches of the L√ºlin, the Xinshi Force () and Pinglin Force () to join forces with him, and they had some military success. Encouraged, Liu Yan launched a frontal assault against Wancheng (), the capital of Nanyang Commandery but suffered a major defeat. Liu Yan and Liu Xiu, along with their sister Liu Boji () survived, but their brother Liu Zhong and sister Liu Yuan died in the battle. Liu Yan's allies, seeing his defeat, considered leaving him, but Liu Yan was able to persuade them, along with another branch of the L√ºlin, the Xiajiang Force (), to join him. In 23 AD, Liu Yan's forces had a major victory against the Xin dynasty forces, killing Zhen Fu (), the governor of Nanyang Commandery. Being passed over as emperor By this point, other rebel leaders were becoming jealous of Liu Yan's capabilities, particularly as many of their men admired Liu Yan and wanted him to become the new emperor of the restored Han Dynasty. The other rebel leaders chose rebel leader, Liu Xuan, a third cousin of Liu Yan, who had taken the title General Gengshi () and who was considered a weak personality, and requested that he be made emperor. Liu Yan initially opposed this move and instead suggested that Liu Xuan carry the title \\"Prince of Han\\" first (echoing the founder of the Han Dynasty, Emperor Gao). The other rebel leaders dismissed this suggestion, and in early 23 AD, Liu Xuan was proclaimed Gengshi Emperor. Liu Yan became prime minister (Â§ßÂè∏Âæí, dasitu). Death After Gengshi Emperor's forces decisively defeated Wang Mang's remaining army at the Battle of Kunyang (in which Liu Yan's brother Liu Xiu played a major part), Gengshi Emperor quickly became at least nominally acknowledged by most of the empire as the legitimate Han emperor. However, Gengshi Emperor remained fearful of Liu Yan's capabilities and keenly aware that many of Liu Yan's followers were angry that Liu Yan had not been made emperor. In particular, Liu Ji (), was very critical of Gengshi Emperor. In response, Gengshi Emperor arrested Liu Ji and wanted to execute him, but Liu Yan tried to intercede to stop the execution. Gengshi Emperor, encouraged by Li Yi (who had by that point turned against Liu Yan) and Zhu Wei (), took this action by Liu Yan as an excuse to execute Liu Yan as well. Liu Xiu only survived because Gengshi Emperor then regretted having executed Liu Yan. After Liu Yan's death, Liu Xiu looked after Liu Yan's sons Liu Zhang () and Liu Xing () and raised them. When Liu Xiu proclaimed himself emperor, founding the Eastern Han Dynasty, in 25 AD, he took steps to honour Liu Yan's sons. In 26 AD, he created Liu Zhang Prince of Taiyuan and Liu Xing Prince of Lu (and made Liu Xing the heir to his other brother, Liu Zhong). In 39 AD, he posthumously honoured Liu Yan with the title Prince Wu (\\"martial prince\\") of Qi (as his son Prince Zhang had, by that point, been moved to the Principality of Qi).

Called the \\"Dean of American Balladeers,\\" Niles was an important influence on the American folk music revival of the 1950s and 1960s, with Joan Baez, Burl Ives, Peter, Paul and Mary and Bob Dylan, among others, recording his songs. Biography Born in Louisville, Kentucky, Niles learned music theory from his mother, and began writing down folk music as a teenager. He became a serious student of Appalachian folk music by transcribing traditional songs from oral sources while an itinerant employee of the Burroughs Corporation in eastern Kentucky, from 1910 to 1917. After serving in the U.S. Army Air Service during World War I, in which he was injured, he studied music in France, first in Lyon, then in Paris at the Schola Cantorum, also meeting Gertrude Stein. Returning to the United States in 1920, he continued his studies at the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music working there with Ralph Lyford. He sang opera in Chicago and folk songs on early radio. In 1925, he moved to New York City and held various jobs in the entertainment industry. In the 1930s, he toured Europe and the United States with contralto Marion Kerby. He performed at the White House in 1938, and on occasion at the Newport Folk Festival during the 1950s. Lt.-John-Jacob- Niles In the 1920s, Niles began publishing music. He made four extended trips into the southern Appalachians as an assistant to photographer Doris Ulmann, again transcribing traditional songs from oral sources, including the ballads \\"Pretty Polly\\", \\"Barbara Allen\\", and \\"He's Goin' Away\\". On other occasions, he transcribed songs he heard sung by African Americans and by fellow soldiers in World War I. Niles was also a noted songwriter. His songs, many based on traditional sources, include \\"Venezuela,\\" and the haunting Christmas song \\"I Wonder As I Wander.\\" Henry Miller's Plexus includes a powerful tribute to Niles's recording of this song. Niles composed \\"Go 'Way From My Window\\" when he was just 16 years old, but did not perform it until 1930. Marlene Dietrich recorded it and sang it on stage. Bob Dylan quoted its first line in his song \\"It Ain't Me Babe.\\" His original new melody to the traditional folk song \\"Black Is the Color (Of My True Love's Hair)\\" was similarly influential in the folk revival of the 1950s and 1960s. Later in life, Niles published compositions in a more classical style, including works for choir and art songs for voice and piano. The latter include the Niles-Merton Songs, a collection of 22 art songs setting the poetry of Thomas Merton. From 1938 he recorded a number of his compositions and transcribed songs, performing the material in an intense, dramatic manner. He employed a trademark very high falsetto vocal range that he described as the \\"electrifying effect of the male C# alto,\\" and accompanied himself on instruments of his own construction that he called Appalachian dulcimers, which were modelled on instruments such as a lute or cello. In 1936, he married Rena Lipetz. They settled on the Boot Hill farm in Clark County, Kentucky, with two sons, Thomas Michael Tolliver and John Edward, where they spent the rest of their lives. Niles died in Lexington, Kentucky on March 1, 1980, at age 87. He is buried at the nearby St. Hubert's Episcopal Church in Clark County, KY.

There is domestic adoption (adopting a non-relative child from within the United States), international adoption (adopting a non- relative child from another country), step parent adoption (adopting a child who is the legal child of one's spouse) and adult adoption (the adoption of an adult from within the United States). Domestic adoption within California The vast majority of adoptions occurring in California is the adoption of domestically born children, most from within California itself. There are two basic types of domestic adoption: independent and agency. An independent adoption is usually arranged by an attorney, with full openness in identities between the birth and adoptive parents. In fact, California law requires that the birth mother personally select the adoptive parents in an independent adoption: she cannot forfeit that decision to another person. Eighty-five percent of all newborn adoptions in California are accomplished via independent adoption. There are two types of agency adoption: private and public/county. Both are licensed to make child placements, but they tend to serve different children. Public/county agencies help find homes for children who are usually under governmental control, typically living in a foster home due to an inability to live in the home of their biological parents. These children tend to be older, and some may have needs requiring extraordinary parenting, but some newborns are also placed via public agencies. Private agencies focus primarily on newborn placements, like independent adoption, but many also serve waiting children. Differences between independent and agency adoption In an agency adoption, the agency must be licensed by the State of California. The California State Department of Social Services offers a website with a listing of licensed agencies. Caution must be exercised that the entity is indeed a licensed agency and not a business using a name which implies it is an agency. California permits \\"facilitators\\" to assist in adoptions (businesses not licensed to perform home studies or take relinquishments or do legal work, but permitted to aid in the process in other ways). Agency adoption first requires that the adoptive parent have a home study completed prior to the placement of a child. The agency then takes the relinquishment of the birth mother (and father if available). For six months following the adoptive placement, the agency supervises the placement, and then can write to the court to approve the adoption. In a typical home study, the adoptive parents are fingerprinted (run through the child abuse registry and criminal index), provide letters of reference, provide proof of marriage if married (although singles may adopt), complete a health and social history, and demonstrate a preparedness to provide a loving home. A court can then grant the adoption in a simple court hearing in which both adoptive parents and the child appear. Since the late 1990s, private agency adoptions involving newborns are mainly open and involve direct contact between birth parents and the adoptive family, as in independent adoption. Public agency adoptions, however, are often closed, with little or no contact between the birth family and the adoptive family. This is usually because the child was already relinquished by the birth parents, or the court terminated their rights. Independent adoption is slightly different and a bit less bureaucratic. It is not required that the adoptive parents have a pre-placement home study (unless the adoption is interstate). The theory is that the birth mother is directly selecting the adoptive parents, rather than relinquishing that decision to an agency. The birth mother (and sometimes the birth father) personally select the adoptive parents, usually by being shown photo-resumes of waiting adoptive parents, then meeting some families in person to select the chosen family. As with agency adoption, a six-month home study follows. In most counties, the home study is done by the California Department of Social Services. In some counties, however, a county office performs the service. Regardless, the home study fee is the same (see below). California adoption law Adoptions are governed by the Family Code. In both agency and independent adoptions, the placing birth parent signs relinquishment documents a few days after birth, in the presence of a licensed social worker and two witnesses. This can become permanent up to 30 days later, or she can waive those 30 days and make the consent permanent immediately. The vast majority of adoptions are successful and few birth parents change their mind, in large part due to adoption counseling provided prior to the placement. Birth fathers can elect to sign the same consenting forms as the birth mother. As a practical matter, however, some non-marital birth fathers can't be found, or decline to be involved. California law allows their rights to be terminated if they don't come forward to actively object, or if they can't be found or their identity is unknown. Costs of independent and agency adoption The home study fee is set at $4,500 in independent adoption, whether done by the California Department of Social Services, or the county equivalent. Attorney fees can range from $1,000 to $15,000, depending upon the services required and the complexity of the adoption. Counseling fees (provided by a person called an Adoption Services Provider) are usually about $700. Some birth mothers need help with pregnancy- related expenses (medical, food, et cetera), which can range from zero to thousands of dollars. Only pregnancy and adoption-related assistance may be legally provided and all expenses must be disclosed to the court. Private adoption agencies, like attorneys in an independent adoption, can charge what they feel is appropriate for the services rendered. To perform the home study, provide counseling and take the birth parent's relinquishment, the fee can range from $5,000 to $50,000. Like independent adoption, the birth mother may have expenses for the adoptive parents to provide. Public agencies, finding homes for waiting children, charge either no fee, or not in excess of $500. The government basically underwrites the cost to find homes for children who otherwise would be staying in foster care and benefit from a permanent and loving home. Step parent adoption No preplacement home study is required, but a six-month evaluation will be required prior to finalization. This is done by a county employee, usually the probation department. The fee is under $1,000. Both the parent who will be retaining their rights and the parent giving up their rights must consent to the new parent assuming parental responsibilities. If a person is looking to adopt a child as a stepparent/domestic partner they have to fill out a series of forms that are accessible through the court clerk or from the California Courts Self-Help Center at www.courtinfo.ca.gov/selfhelp. International adoption Californians adopt from many foreign countries. The process is completely different from a domestic adoption. Please refer to Wikipedia's international adoption for complete information. Adult adoptions Adult adoptions normally require no home study, nor birth parent consent. It is the mutual election of one person to be the lawful child of another. Federal adoption tax credit There is a federal adoption tax credit which can provide income eligible adoptive parents a tax credit of up to $12,970 for tax year 2013 (does not apply to adult or step parent adoptions). Key agencies Key public agencies for California adoptions include: *California Department of Social Services (CDSS) *U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) handles international adoptions The California Department of Social Services (CDSS) operates a \\"Consent Program\\" for adoptees age 18 and over, birth parents, and siblings of adoptees who are 21 years of age or older.

The Montgomery County Historical Society, located in Dayton, Ohio, USA, was designated as official historian of Montgomery County, Ohio, and of the cultural heritage of Ohio's Miami Valley. In 2005, the Society merged with Dayton's Carillon Historical Park to form Dayton History. In 1896, a group of citizens gathered at the Old Court House in Dayton, Ohio to create an organization dedicated to collecting and preserving the history of the Miami Valley. Their goal was to celebrate the city's centennial by saving and converting Newcom's Tavern, Dayton's oldest building (ca. 1796), into the community's first history museum. They called their organization the Dayton Historical Society. The society remained headquartered in Newcom's Tavern for seventy-five years. Newcom's Tavern is now located on the grounds of the Carillon Historical Park in Dayton. In 1968, the society's volunteers took a leadership role in the preservation of another outstanding Dayton landmark, the 1850 Montgomery County Courthouse, the nation's best surviving example of a Greek Revival style courthouse. The Dayton Historical Society became The Montgomery County Historical Society and relocated to the Old Court House. Patterson Homestead in Dayton, Ohio In 1977, the City of Dayton asked the society to provide management and museum services for the 1816 Patterson Homestead (Rubicon Farm), home of Dayton's prominent Patterson family and birthplace of John H. Patterson, founder of the National Cash Register Company (now NCR Corporation). Today, the Patterson Homestead is used for educational programming on life in early Dayton.

Eastlakes is located 8 kilometres south of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the Bayside Council, Eastlakes is mostly residential with a shopping centre located at Evans Avenue. History Eastlakes takes its name from the extensive lake system on its southeast and its location in the Eastern Suburbs. The area was once known as Botany Swamps. This was Sydney's third source of water when water was pumped from here to a reservoir in Paddington from 1859. The lakes were partly reclaimed from the swamp to create the Lakes Golf Course and Sydney Airport extensions. Part of the suburb is on the former site of the Rosebery Racecourse, which was redeveloped in the 1960s into a residential and commercial area.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, , p.91 Part of the racecourse area is now the site of a park with a memorial to local soldiers who trained on that site during both world wars. The Eastlakes area is mainly made up of affordable units and three Public housing, home to four high-rise towers and a large unit complex on the border with Daceyville. Demographics According to 2016 census, The most common ancestries in Eastlakes were Australian 10.5%, Chinese 9.8%, English 9.0%, Greek 7.2% and Bangladeshi 5.2%. 60.2% of people were not born in Australia.

Schools Eastlakes Public School began as an infants school in 1938 and was located in a church hall in O'Connor Street. It moved to Florence Avenue in 1944. When Rosebery Racecourse was demolished and the land developed as a residential area, enrolments at the school naturally increased and there was a need for a primary school, so Eastlakes included a primary school from 1979.Eastlakes Public School Churches The area is served by three churches as of 2009. A LDS Church is located in Mascot Drive. St Stephen's Anglican Church is located in Harry Street.

Edmondson Park is located 32 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Liverpool. Some Southern areas near Bardia is part of City of Campbelltown LGA. History Edmondson Park was named in honour of John Edmondson, who won the first Australian Victoria Cross medal for bravery of World War II. Unfortunately, it had been awarded posthumously in 1941 as he had been killed in action. Miss Gowan Flora MacDonald suggested the name \\"Edmondson\\" be used as a name of a suburb in the area, to honour the locally bred hero. Liverpool Council, regarding it as a fine tribute to the local war hero, offered no objection. This included the area of the present-day suburb of Denham Court, which straddled the council boundary and the support of Campbelltown was needed prior to any name change. Hostile aldermen claimed the \\"Parish of Denham Court\\" was a historic name applying to the whole area, and not just the house or farm. Council advised Liverpool that it objected. In November 1970, the NSW Geographical Names Board attempted a compromise. It decided to name part of the area within Liverpool territory as \\"Edmondson Park\\", while the remainder would simply be \\"Denham\\". The dumping of the word \\"Court\\" only drew unanimous criticism from Campbelltown Council, and the war of words continued until 1976, when the full title \\"Denham Court\\" was finally approved.Campbelltown's Streets and Suburbs - How and why they got their names written by Jeff McGill, Verlie Fowler and Keith Richardson, 1995, published by Campbelltown and Airds Historical Society Future Edmondson Park is part of the South West Growth Centre and is expected to see significant development over the coming years. To support the new development, Edmondson Park railway station opened on 8 February 2015 and has become a thoroughly used train station since its development, as the suburb continues to grow. By mid 2019, the suburb will have a shopping centre will be built with more than 120 shops, a tavern and a cinema, later in few more years time a Town square named Ed Square will be completed, giving future residents world class dining with thousands of apartments, terraces and townhouses. A 68-meter tower will become the centrepiece of the centre and the suburb. Population In the 2016 Census, there were 2,271 people in Edmondson Park. 46.7% of people were born in Australia.

In addition, it is located on the east side of the Nepean River. It has a small local shop, high school, primary school, skateboard park, netball courts, cricket, AFL, Football (Rugby League) oval, a BMX track and a historic house John Oxley Cottage built in the 1890s and converted into the Camden Visitors' centre in 1989. It was named after explorer John Oxley who held an early grant of land in the area. History The area now known as Elderslie was probably originally home to the Tharawal people, based in the Illawarra region, although the Western Sydney-based Darug people and the Southern Highlands-based Gandangara people were also known to have inhabited the greater Camden area. Very early relations with British settlers were cordial but as farmers started clearing and fencing the land affecting food resources in the area, clashes between the groups arose until 1816 when a number of indigenous people were massacred and the remainder retreated from direct conflict with the settlers. In 1795, a group of lost cattle was discovered in the area, earning it the name Cowpastures. In 1805, a small hut was built at Elderslie near the ford on the Nepean River to house two constables assigned to keep an eye on the cattle. This was the first house built by British settlers in the Camden region. Later the same year, wool pioneer John Macarthur was granted 5,000 acres (20 km¬≤) at Cowpastures. After the land was cleared, it was used for farming for most of the next 200 years until Sydney's suburban sprawl reached the town of Camden and modern suburbs like Elderslie were subdivided into housing blocks. Elderslie Post Office opened on 1 January 1839 and closed on 30 April 1841 when it was replaced by the nearby Camden office. It reopened on 1 August 1876 and closed in 1969. PeopleDemographics= At the 2016 census, there were 6,005 residents in Elderslie. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 2.5% of the population. The most common ancestries in Elderslie were English 29.8%, Australian 29.2%, Irish 9.5%, Scottish 7.2% and Italian 3.3%. 82.4% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England at 3.8%. 89.1% of people spoke only English at home. The top responses for religious affiliation were Catholic 30.3%, Anglican 25.9% and No Religion 21.6%.  Governance  Elderslie lies in the south ward of Camden Council, currently represented by Chris Patterson (who is also the Mayor of Camden), Eva Campbell and Fred Whiteman. It sits within the state electorate of Camden, represented by Liberal's Chris Patterson, and the federal electorate of Macarthur, represented by Labor's Dr. Michael Freelander.

It matched the host Chicago Bears and the Portsmouth Spartans. Because of snowfall and anticipated extremely cold temperatures in Chicago, Illinois, it was moved indoors and played at the three-year-old Chicago Stadium on December 18 on a reduced-size field on Sunday night. Standings controversy Since the NFL's first season in 1920, the league title had been awarded to the team with the best regular season record based on winning percentage with ties excluded. Four of the first six championships were disputed, but only in did two teams ever finish tied atop the standings: the two teams disputing the title had played each other, splitting a two-game series, but league officials used a tiebreaker to controversially give the Bears (then known as the Staleys) the title over the Buffalo All-Americans. In 1932, the Spartans and the Bears tied for first place with 6‚Äì1 records. Under the rules at the time, standings were based on winning percentage with ties excluded from the calculation, meaning that the Spartans and Bears each finished the regular season with identical winning percentages, ahead of the defending champion Green Bay Packers' (10 wins, 3 losses) winning percentage. Had pure win-loss differential or the current (post-1972) system of counting ties as half a win, half a loss been in place in 1932, the Packers' record of 10‚Äì3‚Äì1 (, +7) would have won them a fourth consecutive championship, ahead of the Spartans' 6‚Äì1‚Äì4 (, +5) and the Bears' 6‚Äì1‚Äì6 (, +5). The Packers controlled their own destiny at the end of the 1932 season, but lost their final two games to the Spartans and the Bears. Further complicating matters, the Spartans and Bears had played each other twice during the regular season for 13-13 and 7-7 ties, which rendered the league's only tiebreaker useless. As such, for the first time, the league arranged for what amounted to a replay game to determine the NFL champion, but the game would be counted in the final standings, meaning the loser would drop to 6‚Äì2 () and finish third behind runner-up Green Bay. The league also had to make a rule change to allow the game since championship-deciding postseason matches were banned in . Indoor field The game was set to be played at Wrigley Field, the Bears' home stadium, but due to severe blizzards followed by extremely cold temperatures and wind chill, the game was moved indoors to Chicago Stadium. Two years earlier, the Bears and Cardinals had played a charity exhibition game at the arena after the 1930 season, and the game was moved indoors due to extreme weather, allowing for reasonable attendance and gate revenue. The Bears won 9‚Äì7. It wasn't uncommon practice in the city, as local teams played in the Dexter Park Pavilion as early as 1917, when the Racine Cardinals and the Evanstons from Evanston, Illinois played to a 0-0 tie. A week before the game, the concrete surface had tanbark placed atop for a Salvation Army-sponsored circus; elephant manure from the circus produced an odor that caused a Bears player to throw up on the field. Because of the limited dimensions of the indoor arena, special rules were adopted for the game: * The tanbark-covered field itself was only 80 yards long (60 yards between the goal lines) and 45 yards wide, 10 yards narrower than the regulation width at the time. * The sidelines were butted up against the stands. * The goal posts were moved from the endlines to the goal lines (the NFL itself would move the goalposts to the goal line from 1933 to 1974). * Every time a team crossed the 10-yard line, the ball was moved back 20 yards to allow for the shortened field. * For the first time, all plays started with the ball on or between the hash marks, which were ten yards from the sidelines. It was also decided that due to the smaller field and indoor stadium, drop kicks and field goals would not be used in the game. Game summary The high temperature for that Sunday in Chicago was , warmer than anticipated earlier in the week. With terrible footing on the mulch and limited room for the offenses to work, the defenses dominated the game's first three quarters, with the game remaining scoreless. Bears quarterback John Doehling's first pass flew into the stands, as did most punts and kickoffs, with one colliding with a Chicago Black Hawks sign and another hitting the organist as he played. By the end of the game, only one punt was returned. On one drive, the Spartans were in position to score when Glenn Presnell tripped on the field before he could reach the end zone. For the Bears, they employed a heavy run game with fullback Bronko Nagurski, though possessions ended after just three downs as Ralph Jones frequently elected to pooch kick. In the fourth quarter, the Bears scored on a controversial touchdown: Carl Brumbaugh handed the ball off to Nagurski, who pulled up and threw to Red Grange in the end zone for the score. Rules at the time mandated that a forward pass had to be thrown from at least five yards behind the line of scrimmage. The Spartans argued Nagurski did not drop back five yards before passing to Grange, but the touchdown stood. The Bears later scored a safety after the Spartans fumbled the ball out of their end zone.

The goal posts were moved from the end line back to the goal line (reversed in ), all plays started with the ball on or between the hash marks, and the forward pass became legal anywhere behind the line of scrimmage; ironically, the forward pass rule was supported by Spartans head coach George Clark, who quipped, \\"Nagurski would do it anyway!\\" Its biggest legacy, however, was the creation of the NFL Championship Game in 1933, the NFL's original championship game, which would become the Super Bowl. NFL Commissioner Joseph Carr described the rule changes as providing better scoring opportunities, which he believed \\"would improve the game for both players and spectators.\\" Carr had attended the Playoff Game, and kept a ticket stub from the game in his personal scrapbook. In , the NFL expanded to ten teams and divided into two divisions. The division winners met in a scheduled championship game to determine the NFL champion. The 1932 NFL Playoff Game is also regarded as the first major indoor football game, a variation of American football with rules modified to make it suitable for play inside arenas. While several attempts to develop a true indoor football game have been made since then, the only version to meet with anything resembling true success and acceptance has been arena football. This game was the first‚Äîand, for the next 87 years, only‚Äîtime in which the NFL used an 80-yard field. In 2019, the Raiders and Packers met at IG Field in Winnipeg for a preseason game. The field, home to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League, normally has goal posts 110 yards apart. The posts were moved for the NFL preseason game, but the resulting divots in the field caused a safety hazard. To allow the game to go on, the game was played on a hastily shortened 80-yard field. Kickoffs were eliminated and each team started play at its own 15-yard line.

Emu Heights is located 58 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Penrith. Emu Heights sits on the land of the Dharug people, who are the traditional owners of the area. Sitting on the Blue Mountains escarpment and on the western side of the Nepean river, the suburb is just outside the Sydney metropolitan area. It is bounded to the east by the Nepean River and to the west by Blue Mountains local government area. History The Dharug people inhabited the land now known as Emu Heights and are the traditional owners of the land. Emu Heights was established by George Innes, a free settler from Bathurst who obtained in 1831, near McCann's Island and named it Emu Heights. However, the name \\"Emu Heights\\" wasn't officially assigned to the neighbourhood until early 1976.  Schools  Emu Heights Public School was founded in 1972. The school had only eighty seven pupils and three teachers, but now has over three hundred students enrolled. The school's teaching revolves around seven Key Learning Areas, English, Mathematics, Science, ICT, Human society and its environment, the Creative Arts and Personal Health and Social Development.  Parks  Clissold Park is host to great diversity of Australia's fauna and flora and features basketball, netball and children's playground facilities. The park does not have formal field sporting facilities but is more than large enough for such and regularly used by the close knit people of Emu Heights for community events. There is a peaceful stream that flows down from the mountain escarpment, though this stream has been recorded to flood the whole park and north along Wedmore Rd in major storms. (The stream was diverted east by housing developers in the 1980s who followed a farmers drainage channel rather that the original flow north beside Wedmore Rd to the Nepean river). A larger unnamed parkland also exists at the north end of Emu Heights, between the suburb and the Nepean River, giving wide access to the river. Sporting fields and golf facilities are being considered for this parkland. Fishing and canoeing are popular as this section of the river is not used by power boats. The section of river accessible from Emu heights is home to a large variety of native and migratory waterbirds. In the early 1960s, the native egg laying mammal the platypus could still be found in this section of the river but has since become extinct. Population According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 3,289 people in Emu Heights. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 3.4% of the population. * 85.3% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England at 4.0%. * 93.0% of people spoke only English at home. * The most common responses for religion were Catholic 32.6%, No Religion 24.0% and Anglican 22.6% * The most common ancestries were English 30.4%, Australian 30.1%, Irish 10.5%, Scottish 7.9% and German 3.2%. * Of occupied private dwellings in Emu Heights, 98.6% were separate houses.

It is 11 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of Municipality of Burwood. History The suburb is named after Enfield Town, a suburb of London, England. =Aboriginal culture= Before the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788, the Enfield area belonged to the Wangal people, a clan of the Eora tribe, which covered most of Sydney. In the early years, the Eora people were badly affected by smallpox, which arrived with the British. Many of the clans became unsustainably small and the survivors formed new bands who lived where they could. While it would be wrong to say that the local indigenous population gave no resistance to British land claims (Pemulwuy being a notable example), within thirty years or so of the colony's establishment, most of the land in the inner-west had been conceded to British settlers. =European settlement= William Faithful was granted in 1810 covering what is now Enfield as well as much of Croydon Park and parts of Burwood and Croydon. In 1812, Liverpool Road was built through Faithful's land and the high position of Enfield made it a sensible spot for a staging post along the road. By the mid-1840s a small village had formed and the surrounding area supported vegetable gardening and a timber industry. St Thomas' Anglican Church was built in 1848 and is the oldest surviving building in the suburb.Book of Sydney Suburbs, Frances Pollon (Angus and Robertson) 1990, p.96 Strathfield Souththumbleft In 1853, a post office was built. This was the first recorded use of the name Enfield for the area although it may already have been unofficially known as that. In 1889, Enfield was deemed large enough to have its own municipal council which covered a larger area than the current suburb including those parts of the current Burwood and Strathfield councils south of Liverpool Rd. In 1891, its municipal population of 2,050 was larger than that of neighbouring Strathfield (1,850) and only just smaller than another neighbour Canterbury (2,426). Enfield retained its separate identity until 1949 when the NSW state government decided to abolish a number of small local councils by amalgamating them with their neighbours. The Municipality of Enfield was split, with the eastern part (present-day Enfield and the western part of Croydon Park) absorbed into the Municipality of Burwood, and the western part (present-day Strathfield South, historically part of Druitt Town) absorbed into the Municipality of Strathfield.burwood.nsw.gov Enfield Olympic Pool, located in Henley Park is the oldest freshwater pool in Sydney, completed in 1933 and officially opened by Bertram Stevens, NSW Premier and Colonial Treasurer, on 18 November 1933. The Enfield War Memorial, now in Strathfield South, is situated on the corner of Liverpool Road and Coronation Parade on the lawn outside the former Enfield Council Chambers. The memorial is a rectangular sandstone pedestal with four marble plaque panels with the engraved names of the men and women who served during World War I. The top of the pedestal displays a 105mm French Howitzer gun that was donated to the Australian Government by the French government as recognition of Australia's wartime assistance during World War I. The Memorial was unveiled on 11 October 1924 by the NSW Attorney-General and later by the Premier of NSW from 1927-1930. Erection of the memorial was made possible by Mayor and Mayoress of Enfield, Mr and Mrs Ebenezer Ford. The wheel treads of the French howitzer gun which are made of wood are still intact. =Enfield tram lines= Enfield tram depot, in present-day Croydon Park, in the late 1940s Between 1891 and 1948, Enfield was served by a tram line centred around a depot in present-day Croydon Park, in Tangarra Street. The line began as a steam tramway, opened in 1891, between Ashfield Station and Enfield. In 1901, this line was extended north via Liverpool Road and Burwood Road through Burwood to Mortlake, and in 1909 a branch to Cabarita Park was opened. The system was electrified in 1912. The line was never connected to any of the other tram lines in Sydney, although its eastern terminus, at Ashfield station, was only one station away (on the main suburban railway line) from the nearest tram terminus at Summer Hill station. The northern part of Coronation Reserve (the grassy green space that runs down the centre of Coronation Parade) lies on top of the original tram tracks that led, in a straight line, directly north to the intersection with Liverpool Road and the Boulevarde. In the other direction, the line led from Ashfield station. thumb Services operated from Ashfield Station along Liverpool Road, Georges River Road and Tangarra Street, then north along Coronation Parade in a straight line passing what is now the Enfield War Memorial and back to Liverpool Road along the boundary between Enfield and Burwood, and then north along Burwood Road through Burwood. The line then turned into Crane Street, then Majors Bay Road and Brewer Street to Cabarita Junction. The line was double track until this point, it then split into single-track branches to Mortlake and Cabarita. Short services were turned back at Brighton Avenue, Plymouth Street, Enfield, Burwood Station and Wellbank St. Services operated every five minutes between Ashfield and Wellbank Street in peak periods, and every 15 minutes (30 minutes at off-peak times) on the two branches. A depot on Tangarra Street served the lines. The lines closed in 1948, and were replaced by buses. The roadway to the east of Coronation Reserve, now used for motor through-traffic as part of Coronation Parade, was built beside the original tram track until the main intersection where the road was then built over the tracks and became the Boulevarde. The Coronation Parade Arch, built in 1937 to commemorate the coronation of King George VI, formerly led into the Coronation Parade tram station. The arch displays four light bulbs in sockets which were originally the holders for the four electricity cables that ran along the old tram line. Features Enfield itself is a small suburb, bounded by Liverpool Road to the north, Coronation Parade to the west, Mitchell Street to the south and Burwood Road to the east. There is a small commercial area along Liverpool Road centred on the intersection with Coronation Parade and The Boulevarde. There are other commercial premises around that junction but within the boundaries of the suburbs of Strathfield, Burwood and Strathfield South. There are larger commercial areas nearby around Strathfield and Burwood stations. Because Enfield the modern-day suburb is much smaller than the historical Enfield municipality or locality, there are a number of establishments in nearby suburbs that are named \\"Enfield\\", but are not in Enfield itself. An example is the Enfield Intermmodal Logistics Centre, a large rail yard and logistics hub, which is located in neighbouring Strathfield South. Likewise, neither the historic Enfield Town Hall nor the associated war memorial are in the suburb of Enfield. = Churches = St Thomas's Anglican Church (1848) St Joseph's Catholic Church on Liverpool Road was built 1930-31.A Pictorial Guide to Identifying Australian Architecture, Apperly (Angus and Robertson) 1994, p.155 The church was designed by architect Clement Glancy in Inter-War Academic Classical style inspired by √âglise de la Madeleine, Paris.

History Enmore was named after Enmore House, built in 1835 by Captain Sylvester Browne, a master mariner with the British East India Company. Browne named his house after the Guyana estate of a business associate, the head of James Cavan & Co, which in turn took its name from Enmore in Somerset, England. Browne's son wrote several Australian classics, including Robbery Under Arms, under the name of Rolf Boldrewood. In 1836, there was a report of snowfall in the suburb. Weather observer T. A. Browne stated, \\"the years 1836, 1837 and 1838 were years of drought, and in one of these years [1836] a remarkable thing happened. There was a fall of snow; we made snowballs at Enmore and enjoyed the usual schoolboy amusements therewith\\". Enmore House was the home of the Josephson family from 1842 to 1883, when it was demolished. After Josephson's death, his son Joshua Frey Josephson lived there until 1883. Joshua Frey Josephson had four sons and nine daughters from three marriages. One son, Joshua Percy Josephson, was Mayor of Marrickville in 1901. Five streets are named after five of the daughters: Clara, Laura, Marian, Pearl and Sarah. The house at 75 London Street is listed on the Inner West Council local government heritage register and the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate. It was built and is a notable example of the Federation Queen Anne style, with elaborate Art Nouveau elements.The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981, p.2/44 Enmore is home to Sydney's oldest running live theatre.

Up until the 1980s, the theatre also served as a revival cinema screening classic and contemporary films.  Heritage listings  Enmore has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 88 Enmore Road: Stanmore House Commercial area Enmore is primarily residential, although there is a commercial strip along Enmore Road, which turns off the more famous King Street, Newtown. The now disused, former Enmore Post Office (built 1895) on the corner of Enmore and Stanmore Roads, is listed on the Register of the National Estate as an example of Federation Queen Anne architecture. It was designed by the government architect, Walter Liberty Vernon. Schools The suburb is home to the Design Campus of the Sydney Institute, on the site of the former Enmore Boys High School.

Ermington is located 19 kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Parramatta. Ermington lies on the northern bank of the Parramatta River.Place Name Search, Results for Ermington , Geoscience Australia (accessed 19 June 2006) HistoryAboriginal culture= The area now known as Ermington was associated with the Wallumettagal/Wallumedegal people.Living Harbour: Aboriginal Clan Names Map , Living Harbour website, Australian Museum (accessed 20 June 2006)Living Harbour: Aboriginal Clan Names Chart , Living Harbour website, Australian Museum (accessed 20 June 2006) References also note that the area had been controlled by the Wongal/Wangal people. =European settlement= Ermington was originally part of the Field of Mars area. In February 1792, Governor Arthur Phillip granted parcels of land on the northern bank of Parramatta River in the Field of Mars to eight marines: Isaac Archer, John Carver, John Colthread, Thomas Cottrell, James Manning, Alexander McDonald, Thomas Swinnerton and Thomas Tining. Most of the parcels were about in size, except for McDonald's which was 130 acres (apparently because he was married). The settlers used their land to grow wheat, maize and vegetables.Jervis, J.

Alexander McDonald's grant extended northward from Parramatta River to approximately present-day Stevens Street, and westward to present-day Spurway Street. His house is still standing near Parramatta River at 15-17 Honor Street. In 1809 he acquired an extra . He used his land to grow wheat, which he ground, dressed and sold to a baker in Sydney. After McDonald's death, his widow sold part of the land of about 45 acres to Seargent George MacDonald (no relation), who in turn sold it to Henry Bowerman and Charles Campbell. Bowerman named his estate 'MARION' developing an orchard and vineyard on the land, and he built the MARION homestead on the hill where present-day Rydalmere East Public School with sweeping views of Parramatta River now stands. Mrs Bowerman put the estate up for sale in 1857, though it was 1862 before she actually disposed of it at auction.Empire Newspaper 20.11.1857 p8 Jamed Hartwell Williams, a well known colonist and long time American Consul resided at 'Marion' for several years in the early 1870s.NSW Government Gazette 31'3'1874 p995 The estate passed into the hands of developers in the 1880s who renamed it the 'Broadoaks Estate' and 'Broadoaks House'. The remainder of McDonald's land was purchased by E. B. Miller, who built Rose Farm in Honor Street. John Colthread's grant comprised across present-day Wharf Road. The Police Magistrate to Parramatta, Major Edmund Lockyer, purchased the land in 1827 and built the stone mansion Ermington - named after the parish in Devon, England, where his second wife, Sarah Morris, was born. The house was completed in 1828 and stood near the current Ryde-Parramatta Golf Course. Locker increased his land holdings and by 1830 was grazing 1280 sheep and over 300 head of cattle on more than 1900 hectares. He subdivided some of his land in 1841 and advertised it for sale as the \\"Village of Ermington\\", but not many blocks were sold. In 1843, Lockyer sold off his remaining holdings. Lockyer died in 1860. His third child by his second marriage, born in England, was named Sarah Ermington Lockyer. =Agriculture= Ermington played an early role in Australia's wine industry. In 1806 Gregory Blaxland established a vineyard in what is now Ermington and produced award-winning wines. During March 1822 Australia's first wine export was shipped to England from Blaxland's 'Brush Farm' vineyard in Ermington.Wine and Grape History in the Sydney Region , Nepean Hawkesbury Wine & Grape Growers Association Inc (accessed 20 June 2006). This source draws its information from: Norrie, Dr Philip., 1990, Vineyards of Sydney - Cradle of the Australian Wine Industry from First Settlement to Today, Horwitz Grahame Pty Ltd, Sydney, p222. From the 1830s, the Ermington region became an important source of fruit for early Sydney, and it was a busy place in the packing season. Produce such as oranges, lemons, apples and apricots was carted down to Pennant Hills Wharf, and small boats including the Amy and the Growers Friend would transport it on to the markets in Sydney. Blue metal from the quarry in present-day Dundas Valley was also transported to Sydney for road building. =Industrial and residential development= In November 1886, the land bounded by present-day Silverwater Road, Jackson Street, Spurway Street and Lindsay Avenue was offered at auction as the Broad Oaks Estate. However, the auction was unsuccessful and the land reverted to grazing and dairying. Many years later the land was acquired by John Bridge Ltd, who engaged surveyors Lockie, Gannon, Worley and Campbell to prepare the current curvilinear design in 1930. The streets were named after Australian painters.Parramatta Development Control Plan 2001. Appendix 6: Special Character Area. Further south, parts of the lower area adjacent to the Parramatta River were filled in the early 1930s in anticipation of a residential subdivision, also to be known as the Broadoaks Estate. However, these plans were stifled by the Great Depression. In 1943, the site was occupied by the Ermington Naval Storage Depot. Seven large nissen-style storage and repair warehouses were constructed to serve as a supplies store for the United States Army during World War II. The Royal Australian Navy continued to use the site for several years after the war to store non- explosive materials, and Prix Car Services used it to hold cars in the 1990s.Parramatta Development Control Plan 2001.

Eventually the operation was decommissioned and the site revegetated. Since the Sydney property boom in the early 2000s, a wave of young families have settled in Ermington in search for affordable houses, while the continued development of Parramatta attracts professional workers. In 2006/07, the site of the former Ermington Naval Storage Depot was cleared and Stockland commenced development of its Riverwalk estate, featuring high- market housing beside the Parramatta River.

The barracks used to be overlooked by a very tall antenna tower, providing communications for the army. The tower was pulled down some years ago. Today there is a mobile phone tower not too far from the site of the original army tower. The barracks opened on 17 February 1968, on the former site of the 2CH radio station transmitter.

Eschol Park is located 60 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Campbelltown and is part of the Macarthur region. History The area now known as Eschol Park was originally home to the Tharawal people, based in the Illawarra region.Liston, C: Campbelltown: The Bicentennial History, Allen & Unwin, 1988: p.1-4. In 1805, wool pioneer John Macarthur was granted 5,000 acres (20 km¬≤) at Cowpastures (now Camden). This in turn led to other land grants in what is now known as the Macarthur area. One of these was a property named Eagle Vale. Campbelltown postmaster and storekeeper William Fowler bought the property in 1858 with the intention of establishing a vineyard. As a devout Christian, he gave the property a biblical name 'Eshcol Park'. An avenue of fine old trees in Eschol Park Drive, off Raby Road, guards what was once the entrance to the historic mansion. The house itself (the first parts of which were built in 1816) is now a restaurant. Fowler quickly established an extensive vineyard and two-storey winery on his property, and within a decade or so, was producing 2000 to 3000 gallons of award-winning wines. In 1876, he sold all his land to Samuel Spencer Milgate, who owned a local produce store off Queen Street. John Gorus, a Dutch photographer, bought the property two years later and continued the viticulture tradition. While Gorus was the owner, Eschol Park was auctioned by Hardie & Gorman. The pamphlet described a brick and stone residence, wine cellars, an ornamental lake, extensive flower gardens, and an orchard planted with oranges, bananas, and almost \\"every description of stone fruit\\". Farm buildings included a stable, cow house, buggy house, carpenter's workshop and a slaughter house. One feature described in the auction pamphlet was a large manure tank \\"into which the sweepings of the sheep sheds, stables, and fowl houses are placed ; there they remain until winter, when each vine and tree that appears to require assistance receives its share.\\" But vineyards across the region were badly hit in the 1890s when the phylloxera disease struck, and Eschol Park was devastated. The area remained rural hills, dominated by dairy cattle, until the mid-1970s, when it was earmarked for future housing developments. In 1975, when plans for a suburb at the site were under way, the Geographical Names Board of New South Wales inadvertently approved the use of the incorrectly spelt Eschol Park. By April 1978, Landcom was building its Highfield Estate, the first part of the proposed suburb. Its brick gateway can still be seen off Raby Road. Landmarks Eschol Park Primary School was opened in 1985, and the nearby Eschol Park Sports Complex was created in the early 1980s. This complex, consisting of sporting fields which double as water detention basins in times of flood, follows a branch of the old Eagle Creek. This was converted into a series of cascading detention basins in the 1970s, and a public park now stands on what was once the headwaters - Eagle Creek Reserve. A minor tributary creek running into it had once been known as \\"Vale Brook\\". Hence the name Vale Brook Reserve. The early vigneron of Eschol Park himself is remembered by William Fowler Reserve. PopulationDemographics= In the 2016 Census, there were 2,582 people in Eschol Park. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 4.5% of the population. The most common ancestries in Eschol Park (State Suburbs) were Australian 27.1%, English 25.7%, Scottish 6.8% and Irish 6.1%. 75.5% of people were born in Australia and 76.9% of people spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religion were Catholic 33.5%, No Religion 20.8% and Anglican 17.7%. Of occupied private dwellings in Eschol Park, 93.8% were separate houses.  Politics  Eschol Park is a suburb of the City of Campbelltown, of which the current mayor is Paul Hawker. It sits within the state electorate of Macquarie Fields, represented by Labor's Anoulack Chanthivong, and the federal electorate of Werriwa, represented by Labor's Mike Freelander.

In the United States, it is commonly known as tulip poplar or yellow poplar, even though the tree is not related to the poplars. In fact, the reference to poplar is a result of the tree's height, which can exceed 100 feet. The wood is very light, around 490 kg per cubic meter,Tulipwood published by Niche Timbers. but very strong and is used in many applications, including furniture, joinery and moldings. It can also be stained very easily and is often used as a low-cost alternative to walnut and cherry in furniture and doors.

It is used for inlays in furniture and for small turned items. Available only in small sizes, it is rarely used in the solid for luxury furniture. Like other woods with a pronounced figure it is rather strongly subject to fashion. In the nineteenth century Brazilian tulipwood was thought to be the product of the brazilian rosewood Physocalymma scaberrimum (West Indian tulipwood), but in the twentieth century it became clear it was yielded by a species of Dalbergia.Record S.J., Clayton D.M.: Timbers of tropical America. Yale Univ. Press, 1924, p. 288, 455, online on babel.hathitrust.org. At some point it was misidentified as Dalbergia frutescens, a misidentification which can still be found in books aimed at the woodworker. For some decades it has been known to be yielded by Dalbergia decipularis, a species restricted to a small area in Western-Brazil.

History  Appalshop was founded in 1969 as the Appalachian Film Workshop, a project of the United States government's War on Poverty. The organization was one of ten Community Film Workshops started by a partnership between the federal Office of Economic Opportunity and the American Film Institute. In 1974 the worker-operated organization evolved into a nonprofit company called Appalshop and established itself as a hub of filmmaking in Appalachia, and since that time has produced more than one hundred films, covering such subjects as coal mining, the environment, traditional culture, and the economy. The name was officially changed to reflect changing business structure and goals. Appalshop also produces theater, music, and spoken-word recordings (released on its June Appal Recordings label), as well as photography, multimedia, and books. Appalshop Main Building - Whitesburg, Kentucky Since 1985, Appalshop has also operated WMMT-FM (Mountain Community Radio), a radio station located in Whitesburg, Kentucky which serves much of central Appalachia (including portions of eastern Kentucky, southwest Virginia, and western West Virginia) with music and programming relevant to the region and its culture. WMMT also broadcasts live on the web.  Mission  As stated on its website, Appalshop's goals are: :*To document, disseminate, and revitalize the lasting traditions and contemporary creativity of Appalachia; :*To tell stories the commercial cultural industries don't tell, challenging stereotypes with Appalachian voices and visions; :*To support communities' efforts to achieve justice and equity and solve their own problems in their own ways; :*To celebrate cultural diversity as a positive social value; and :*To participate in regional, national, and global dialogue toward these ends.

It is about 760 km due west of Sydney and 90 km north-east of Mildura. The lake is the central feature of Mungo National Park, and is one of seventeen lakes in the World Heritage listed Willandra Lakes Region. Many important archaeological findings have been made at the lake, most significantly the discovery of the remains of Mungo Man, the oldest human remains found in Australia,New age for Mungo Man, new human history : Media Releases : News : The University of Melbourne Mungo Woman, the oldest human remains in the world to be ritually cremated and as the location of the Lake Mungo geomagnetic excursion, the first convincing evidence that Geomagnetic excursions are a geomagnetic phenomenon rather than sedimentological. Geology The shore of Lake Mungo. Sediments at Lake Mungo have been deposited over more than 120,000 years. On the eastern side of the Mungo lake bed are the \\"Walls of China,\\" a series of crescent-shaped sand dunes or lunettes, up to 40m in height, that stretch for more than 33 km, where most archaeological material has been found. There are three distinct layers of sands and soil forming the Walls. The oldest is the reddish Gol Gol layer, formed between 100,000 and 120,000 years ago. The middle greyish layer is the Mungo layer, deposited between 50,000 and 25,000 years ago. The most recent is the Zanci layer, which is pale brown, and was laid down mostly between 25,000 and 15,000 years ago. The Mungo layer, which was deposited before the last ice age period, is the most archaeologically rich. Although the layer corresponded with a time of low rainfall and cooler weather, more rainwater ran off the western side of the Great Dividing Range during that period, keeping the lake full. It supported a significant human population, as well as many varieties of Australian megafauna. A close up of the Lake Mungo lunette During the last ice age period, the water level in the lake dropped, and it became a salt lake. This made the soil alkaline, which helped to preserve the remains left behind in the Walls. Although the lake completely dried up several thousand years ago, ground vegetation remained on the Walls, which helped to stabilise them and protect them from erosion. With the arrival of European settlers in the area since the 1880s, introduced species, notably rabbits and sheep, have destroyed the vegetation cover. Herds of feral goats are also present in the region. This has led to increased erosion of the dunes. However, this erosion has led to the uncovering of many human and animal remains. Wind has moved sand and soil eastwards from the Walls, forming a mobile sand dune which moves further east every year. Archaeology: Lake Mungo fossils The most important findings at Lake Mungo have been Mungo Man and Mungo Woman. Mungo Woman, a partially cremated body, was discovered in 1969 by Dr Jim Bowler from the Australian National University (ANU). Mungo Woman was only partially cremated before the remainder of her bones were crushed. The time that was taken into her burial is demonstration of an advanced ritualistic process. She was initially estimated to be 25,000 years old, although a more recent multi- university study in 2003 determined that she was probably closer to 40,000 years old. Mungo Woman is thus the earliest known human to have been cremated. Mungo Man was also discovered by Dr Bowler, on 26 February 1974. The remains were covered with red ochre, in what is the earliest known incidence of such a burial practice. Red ochre is commonly used in burials for ritualistic purposes. The site was dating using OSL dating, or luminescence dating. The site is dated to be 60 kya. If the fossils are actually from 60 kya, the fossils would be that of archaic Homo sapiens. Mungo man There is evidence of human habitation of the area around Lake Mungo that is as much as 50,000 years old. Stone tools have been found in the dunes which are older than the Mungo Man. Grinders for making flour have been found which are estimated to be between 5,000 and 10,000 years old; they were made of sandstone sourced from the Murray River basin 100 km away. A stone axe head, estimated to be at least 500 years old, was also found in the dunes; it was made from stone from Mount Camel, near Shepparton, well over 300 km away. Genetic evidence has supported the theory of multiple waves of hominids moving into Australia. The migration is believed to consist of two groups moving into the continent at different periods. This would imply that hominids before 60 kya had the knowledge and skill to create a sturdy and sophisticated sea craft in order to sail all the way to Australia. The different years for which artifacts and the remains were found puts into debate the actual time in which Australia was inhabited. If it was inhabited 60 thousand years or over, it puts in question the theory that all civilizations derived from Africa. If, however, Mungo Man and Mungo Lady truly are evidence that Australia has only been inhabited for about 50,000 years, the theory of Africa is stronger than ever. This would put Mungo Man and Mungo Lady's civilization in the same time frame as other cultures that were just beginning to settle outside of Africa.http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/02/0224_030224_mungoman_2.html The discovery of these remains is important to Archaeology because we discover the beginnings of cremation as a burial ritual and in addition we find more evidence for the \\"out of Africa\\" theory. The rich archaeological heritage of the site is very significant to the Aboriginal Australian people from the area. The Willandra region is inhabited by the Barkindji, Nyiampaa and Mutthi Mutthi peoples, who have now entered Joint Management Agreements with the Government of New South Wales to manage the lake and the Mungo National Park. =Lake Mungo geomagnetic excursion= In 1972, Archaeomagnetic studies were conducted on the prehistoric aboriginal fireplaces occurring along the ancient shoreline of Lake Mungo. Magnetization preserved in oven-stones and baked hearths show that the axial dipole field moved up to 120 degrees from its normal position around 30,000 years ago. Called a geomagnetic excursion, the event occurred between 30,780 and 28,140 years BP with a very high field strength of 1 to 2√ó10‚àí4 T (around 3.5 times higher than Earths current 5.8√ó10‚àí5 T) which subsequently decreased to .2 to .3√ó10‚àí4 T. There is also evidence of a second excursion around 26,000 BP with a field strength of .1 to .2√ó10‚àí4 T. Because most of the excursions found before Lake Mungo were contained in sedimentary material, it had been suggested that the magnetic field directional anomalies were detrital or diagenetic in origin. The Lake Mungo results were due to thermoremanent magnetization, ruling out a sedimentological phenomenon. Two excursions have been recorded in sediments from Skjonghelleren on Valder√∏y, Norway with the Virtual Geomagnetic Pole (VGP) of one being synchronous with Lake Mungo suggests that the Lake Mungo event was global rather than a local event. Data from lake sediments of a similar age in France having near identical magnetic field lines also support Lake Mungo being a global event. However, it has been suggested that Lake Mungo's anomalous field is the result of lightning strikes.

Copiapite can also refer to a mineral group, the copiapite group. Copiapite is strictly a secondary mineral forming from the weathering or oxidation of iron sulfide minerals or sulfide-rich coal. Its most common occurrence is as the end member mineral from the rapid oxidation of pyrite. It also occurs rarely with fumaroles. It occurs with melanterite, alunogen, fibroferrite, halotrichite, botryogen, butlerite and amarantite. It is by far the most common mineral in the copiapite group. It rarely occurs as single crystals, is in the triclinic crystal system, and is pale to bright yellow. It is soluble in water, changing the water color to deep orange or orangish-red. In solution copiapite is very acidic. In high concentrations a negative pH can occur, as reported in waters draining from Richmond Mine at Iron Mountain, California. Copiapite can easily be distinguished from native sulfur because it does not give off an odor when dissolved in water. It can be distinguished from similar appearing uranium minerals, such as carnotite, by its lack of radioactivity. The only way to differentiate between the minerals in the copiapite group is by X-ray diffraction. Copiapite was first described in 1833 for an occurrence near Copiap√≥, Atacama, Chile.

Fairlight is located 13 kilometres north-east of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of Northern Beaches Council and is part of the Northern Beaches region. Fairlight lies between Balgowlah and Manly on both sides of Sydney Road. The suburb reaches north past Balgowlah Road and the western boundary is Hill Street. History Fairlight takes its name from Fairlight House built by Henry Gilbert Smith (1802-1886) on land he bought in 1853 from John Parker who had received a land grant in 1837. The house was named after Fairlight, East Sussex, a historic village in Hastings, on the south coast of England.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 104 Fairlight was originally only the area near the beach where Fairlight House once stood, and the suburb at the top of the hill was called Red Hill, due to the pre World War II red gravel surface of Sydney Road. Name legacy The Port Jackson & Manly Steamship Company has a tradition of naming its ferries after the suburbs of the Northern Beaches. A paddle steamer ferry was commissioned in 1878 and named \\"Fairlight\\". In 1966, the company commissioned a hydrofoil Fairlight, which in turn gave its name to the Fairlight CMI synthesizer. In 1987 Strider and Black Shadow named the now legendary warez and demogroup Fairlight after this synthesizer company. Landmarks Fairlight has a cemetery in Griffiths Street. The Manly Fire Station is located on Sydney Road, Fairlight. =Fairlight Beach = Dutch submarine K-12 on Fairlight Beach in 1949 Fairlight Beach is located on the Manly Scenic Walkway on Sydney Harbour, which can be followed for some kilometres to Spit Bridge. The beach experiences light harbour swells and southerly winds. Though swells up to 2 metres were recorded following Hurricane Larry, it is not a surfing beach, as the shore is rocky and the break unpredictable. The beach has sand largely made up of shell grit (largely missing from the beaches on either side), and a small tidal swimming pool. The K-12 was a 611-ton ex- submarine of the Royal Netherlands Navy (later the United States Navy) that was bought by private buyers after World War II and leased to the Port Jackson & Manly Steamship Company, who set her up as a museum ship at a custom berth adjacent to Manly harbour pool. When storms struck in June 1949, an attempt was made by her owners to tow her to a safer berth in Neutral Bay, however the tow ropes broke, and the submarine grounded on rocks near Fairlight Beach. The hull was lightened by salvagers then re-floated on 7 January 1951, and towed up the Parramatta River to Ryde Road bridge; however here she sank again after her seacocks were vandalised. Some sources say that the engines and sections of the bow remain in Fairlight and are accessible by scuba divers. However, they are the remains of a large aluminum speedboat that got blown by high winds and sunk on the night of 7 January 1952. Population AIn the 2016 Census, there were 5,840 people in Fairlight. 63.6% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 11.8% and New Zealand 2.8%. 84.3% of people only spoke English at home. The most common responses for religion in Fairlight (State Suburbs) were No Religion 40.2%, Catholic 22.5% and Anglican 16.8%. The most common occupations in Fairlight (State Suburbs) included Professionals 38.4%, Managers 21.7%, Clerical and Administrative Workers 11.4%, Community and Personal Service Workers 8.2%, and Sales Workers 8.1%. The median household weekly income was high at $2,620. Housing was expensive in Fairlight, with the median weekly rent being $648 and the median monthly mortgage payment was $3,000. Sport and recreation Fairlight Beach is popular for swimming and snorkelling and as a vantage point to view harbour yacht races. Fairlight is home to the Manly Golf Club and Golf Course. Shops and cafes are located in a shopping strip in Sydney Road. Events Fairlight is home to an annual Christmas Lights fundraising competition on Edwin Street.

It has over 90,000 regular students, 10,000 teaching staff, 17 departments and 106 available degrees. UNLP comprises the Rafael Hern√°ndez National College, the Victor Mercante Lyceum, the Bachelor of Fine Arts program, the School of Agronomy, the La Plata University Radio, the La Plata University Press and numerous academic centers for research and outreach including La Plata Museum of Natural Sciences, the University Public Library, the Samay Huasi Retreat for Artists and Writers, the Institute of Physical Education, the Astronomical Observatory and the Santa Catalina Rural Association. The institution began operations on April 18, 1897, as the Universidad Provincial de La Plata with Dr. Dardo Rocha as its rector. In 1905, Joaqu√≠n V. Gonz√°lez, the Minister of Justice and Public Education of the government of Manuel Quintana, decided to nationalize it. Gonz√°lez also integrated many municipal scientific institutions into the university, and a year later he became the first President of the National University of La Plata. Today the university holds one of the most important paleontological and anthropological collections in South America. Symbols The university coat of arms was adopted at the first university assembly on 14 February 1897. It represents the City of La Plata holding up the \\"Light of Science\\". The constellation of the Southern Cross is also featured, as well as the coat of arms of the Province of Buenos Aires, which is held in the hands of the woman who represents the city. The university emblem is the oak leaf. Its motto \\"Pro Scientia et Patria\\" is a Latin phrase meaning For Science and the Motherland. The university hymn was composed by Carlos L√≥pez Buchardo, and its lyricsLyrics of the university hymn were written by Arturo Capdevilla. The hymn premiered on 23 October 1927 in the Teatro Argentino of La Plata to commemorate the centenary of the death of Ludwig van Beethoven. It was performed by the orchestra of the Col√≥n Theater of Buenos Aires under the direction of Adolfo Morpurgo, a professor in the School of Fine Arts. History of the National University of La Plata Office of the President (NU of LP Archive) =Foundation= The national capital of Buenos Aires was federalized in 1880. This forced the surrounding Province of Buenos Aires to cede the city, and as a result it was left without the greater part of its institutions. The new provincial capital in La Plata was subsequently founded in 1882 but lacked a center of higher education and investigation. With the purpose of rectifying this situation, the provincial senators Rafael Hern√°ndez, Emilio J. Carranza, Marcelino Aravena, and Valent√≠n Fern√°ndez Blanco presented a bill on 12 June 1889 to create a provincial university in La Plata. The proposal had immediate repercussions in the city of La Plata. On 13 June, about 150 youths from the National College, the Argentine Institute, and the Literary Society mobilized around the home of Rafael Hern√°ndez, accompanied by a band, in order to display their support. The law was once and for all passed by the provincial Chamber of Deputies on 27 December 1889 and was enacted as Law Number 233 by Governor M√°ximo Paz on 2 January 1890. The new law established the creation of a university of tertiary studies with four faculties: Law, Medicine, Chemistry and Pharmacy, and Mathematical and Physical Sciences. The new university was expected to open that same year; however, the governor had not written the corresponding regulatory decree, nor had he even mentioned the issue in his final address to the legislature. Due to this delay, a group of local citizens presented a request to the Ministry of Government on 5 May 1891 declaring their intentions that their children study law in La Plata. However, the file on that request was closed in 1893. On 28 May 1894, a similar request was presented to the new governor, Guillermo Udaondo, insisting on the full completion of Law 233. Despite a favourable report made by the Consultancy Office of the government on 28 July of that year, the Ministry of Economy and Government did not advance on the determination of expenses or assignation of resources and a new note was sent to the governor in December 1896. Concurrently, Dr. Dardo Rocha, the founder of the city and first provincial governor, was developing the founding bylaws at the request of Governor Udaondo. This was finally sanctioned on 8 February 1897 ‚Äî seven years after the passing of the law. The first University Assembly came together on 14 February and designated Dardo Rocha himself as the first rector of the university. Studies began on 18 April in the Banco Hipotecario building ‚Äî the present-day site of the Rector's office ‚Äî with a class on Law History given by Jacob Larrain. =Nationalization of the University= Department of Physics (NU of LP Archive) Despite the objectives for which it may have been established, the first years of the university were discouraging, as much for the dearth of students as for the low operating budget. From 1897 to 1905, it only succeeded in enrolling 573 students, owing not only to the low population of La Plata in its founding era but also to the lack of national recognition for the degrees it granted, which heightened the attraction exerted by the University of Buenos Aires. At the same time, Joaqu√≠n V. Gonz√°lez, then Minister of Justice and Education, began to give shape to his idea of creating a national university on the base of the existing provincial university and other teaching institutes. In October 1904, Gonz√°lez, Governor Marcelino Ugarte and the province's congressional delegation convened to advance the nationalization project. This idea took shape with the transfer from a provincial to a national level, on January 1, 1905, of the Veterinary and Agronomy Faculty, the Astronomical Observatory and the fields of Santa Catalina (in Lomas de Zamora). On August 12 of that year the university and its faculties, the La Plata Museum, the La Plata Observatory, the Institute of Arts and Crafts, the University Library, the School and the Teachers' College were taken over by the national government. In the covenant of transfer, the Nation was obliged to found a university institute. On August 15, the creation of the Universidad Nacional de La Plata was approved in the House of Representatives, and on August 19, it received definitive sanction in the National Senate. The bill was signed by President Manuel Quintana on September 25, and on March 17, 1906, the university's first leadership, headed by Joaqu√≠n V. Gonz√°lez and university vice-president Dr. Agust√≠n Alvarez, was elected. In 1908 the national university was composed of the following faculties: * A Faculty of Social and Legal Sciences, with a Department of Teaching and a Department of Philosophy and Letters. * A Faculty of Agronomy and Veterinary Medicine (the one that the Regional School of Agriculture depended on) and the School of Stockbreeding of Santa Catalina. * A Faculty of Physical Science, Mathematics, and Astronomy, which is divided into a School of Mathematical Sciences, a School of Physical Sciences, a School of Astronomical Sciences, a School of Architectural Engineering, and a School of Engineering Hydraulics. * A Faculty of the Museum, (the one that the Faculty of Natural Sciences depended on), the Museum, the School of Chemistry and Pharmacy, the School of Physical Geography and the School of Drawing and Art. * A Department of Primary and Secondary Studies, consisting of the National School, the Secondary School for Young Ladies and the Graduate School. * A Library and the University Extension. * An Astronomical Observatory, consisting of the Division of Seismology, the Division of Meteorology, and the Station of lengths of Oncativo. It is recorded that the university had a student body of 1,845 students in 1908. Joaqu√≠n V. Gonz√°lez served four terms as president, retiring on March 18, 1918. =The era of university reform= University reform in Argentina was a movement that was initiated at the National University of C√≥rdoba in 1918. It sought various changes to the Argentine university system, including free university education, student participation in the administrative bodies of the university, autonomy, curricular flexibility, and university extension. These were to become the pillars of an ideology that spread throughout the universities of Argentina, as well as many others in Latin America. The National University of La Plata had been founded with a strong impulse for university extension which had developed, in its early years, into the form of systematic programs of conferences and courses that were open to the general public. Nevertheless, in other aspects related to the reform movement, its position was a source of controversies. In March 1918 Rodolfo Rivarola took charge of the university. One of the opponents of his election, Jos√© Nicol√°s Matienzo (who would later become Attorney General of Argentina) said about the reform of the Statutes in 1920: \\"Examining the proposed reforms to the statutes of the National University of La Plata, I believe that amongst all the universities of the republic, this is the one that has endured the most oligarchic regime until now.\\". His criticism centered principally on the excessive decision-making power of the president, the excessively long mandates, the possibility of undefined elections and the lack of participation in the designation of instructors. The events of C√≥rdoba had little impact in La Plata that year, with the exception of the proposal by the University Federation carried out in July 1918 on the teaching conditions in the Faculty of Agronomy and Veterinary Medicine. Nevertheless, beneath this calm fa√ßade was brewing an intense movement that was reflected in the pages of the student magazines Atenea of the National School, and Renovaci√≥n of the University Federation. In early 1919, the Upper Council approved the participation of members of the student body in the government of the University by a voice vote. On 20 October of that year, a strike broke out in the entire university, ignited by the resurgence of the conflict in the Faculty of Agronomy and Veterinary Medicine. At the beginning of 1920, after a ferocious crackdown on a student rally in March, the conflict turned violent, culminating in the murder of the student David Viera during an examination in the School of Medical Sciences. In the meantime, a strong rivalry exploded between opposing student factions: the reformers in the University Federation of La Plata and the University Concentration group. On June 5 President Rivarola tendered his resignation, which was accepted by Carlos Melo. In the meantime, Professor Alejandro Korn, a member of the Upper Council, became the most prominent representative of the reformist movement, carrying out some of the demands of the student body, such as the closure of the boarding school of the university which the students considered to be a source of favoritism and nepotism. Student activism staged a return during the university presidency of Nazar Anchorena, from 1921 to 1927. Despite not having achieved significant changes, it maintained the ideals of reform through the group Renovaci√≥n (Renewal), named after its goal of transforming the Federation of the University of La Plata. The federation had at this time become more commonly known by the initials, FULP (Federaci√≥n Universitaria de La Plata). The group was at the center of intense cultural campus activity. It was also the direct antecedent of what would become the university's theater group and the magazine Valoraciones (Appraisals). The latter would become a venue of expression for the reformer Alejandro Korn and such professors as Pedro Henr√≠quez Ure√±a. During this period, the radio station LR11 Radio University was created. Between 1927 and 1930, the presidency was held by Ram√≥n Loyarte and on December 1, 1930, the new president, Ricardo Levene, was elected. His tenure oversaw the turbulence produced by the coup d'√©tat of General Jos√© F√©lix Uriburu, and lasted only six months. The University of Buenos Aires was taken under state control after the coup d'√©tat, with Nazar Anchorena, former president of University of La Plata as administrator. The student body of La Plata considered this a violation of university autonomy. The tension that was generated between the two universities concluded with the expulsion from the University of Buenos Aires of Levene, and of Gabriel del Mazo, dismissed for his loyalty to the overthrown UCR government. There was a student strike, and the Upper Council was abolished by governmental decree, upon which Levene and of all the counselors and deans of the faculties resigned. The university was then \\"intervened\\" (that is, managed by a state-appointed president); extraordinary powers were bestowed upon Federico Walker, who declared his intention to exclude any opposing students, leading to the dismissal of 31 students and various professors. By August of that year, the new regime was well entrenched. During the so-called \\"infamous decade\\" (1931‚Äì1943), characterized by \\"patriotic (i.e., electoral) fraud\\", student participation was much restricted. This enclosed opening was fought by students and educational, and despite those conditions Ram√≥n Loyarte being was appointed as the president of the university January 14, 1932, in May from that year the pressure of the students and of the Upper Counsel forced it to renounce. Already the majority of the students and educational exclude you had been reincorporated the 17 March. On June 25, Dr. Levene was chosen with the support of the University. In 1935 Julio Casti√±eiras took office as the university's president, and in that era the Association of Mutual Aid for the students was created. The company was subsidized by the university and by the students that offered health care and dental services, as well as a community kitchen and a pharmacy. Also in this era a strong dispute between the conduction of the university arose, and the governor of the Province, Manuel Fresco, arose; Fresco's sympathies lay with Italian fascism. In 1938, Dr. Juan Carlos R√©bora was appointed rector, succeeding Julio Casti√±eiras. In that year the number of students reached 9,443. The start of World War II generated strong tensions within the institution, because the politics of neutrality did not allow political demonstrations by public and students. On June 27, 1941 Dr. Alfredo Palacios became president. He urged a return to the foundational view of Joaqu√≠n V. Gonz√°lez, whereby university institutes and faculties were organized as in a sort of \\"federal republic\\", while allowing for synergy and a degree of integration across disciplines. That vision is reflected in a university by a law that mandated: 1) studies of philosophy for all the graduates in the sciences; 2) the development of a series of courses that could provide a historic and ideological background common to may disciplines. These initiatives were eventually abandoned in 1943 during the management of Ricardo de Labougle, leading to an increasing fragmentation. During the era that began with the coup d'√©tat of 4 June 1943, some renewal took place, leading to the creation of the Institute of Theatre, the Commission of Fonograf√≠a Cultural, and the Latin American Institute. During that time, the Samay Huasi (House of Rest) was incorporated as patrimony of the university. =The limitation of university autonomy (1943-1955)= In 1943 to 1945 there was a common denominator for all the national universities: the tension between the de facto government and the reformist sectors that would conform later to the Democratic Union. In October 1943 the administration of Alfredo Palacios was interrupted due to his opposition to decrees issued by the National Executive. From 1952 to 1955 the college was called Eva Per√≥n National University, when the city of La Plata was renamed Eva Per√≥n City. =1966 to 1983Recent history=Artistic extensionThe choirs= The University Choir of the National University of La Plata was the university's first artistic group which was brought about through student initiative and was the first one in its kind in Argentina. Its debut took place on 19 September 1942 under the direction of the maestro Rodolfo Kubik. The choir's motto i\\"Friendship through Music\\" and since its inception, it has encouraged the creation of other university choirs. The First La Plata Festival of University Choirs was organized in 1959, thus initiating a tradition that is maintained to the present time. The choir's repertoire includes classical works, religious music of the 16th century, popular Argentinian folk or contemporary music (with works by composers such as Carlos Guastavino, Atahualpa Yupanqui, √Åstor Piazzolla, Eladia Bl√°zquez), Latin- American music and negro spirituals. Throughout the years, the choir has undertaken many tours including a cycle of concerts in cities along the East Coast of the United States in 1965, in which the choir was invited to take part in the inauguration of the Lincoln Center of New York; a tour of European cities in 1970 with performances in Rome, Paris, Munich, Vienna and Frankfurt; its participation in the 1995 International Music Festival of Cantonigr√≤s; and its 2000 participation in the International Festival of Choir Music \\"America Cantat III\\" in Caracas. The Coro Juvenil (Youth Choir) was created in September 1983, and is now conducted by Mtro. Pablo C√°naves. It has received several prizes, and its repertoire ranges from Renaissance music to contemporary music and popular folksongs. The Chamber Choir was created in 1985. Its objectives are: the musical and professional preparation of youths who aspire to sing professionally; the featuring of soloists and instrumental ensembles; and an emphasis on the musical literature of the 20th century. It is conducted by Mtro. Roberto Ruiz. =The String Quartet= The University String Quartet (Cuarteto de Cuerdas) was created in 1953 by professors of the College of Fine Arts. Its first concert took place at the Sal√≥n Dorado of the municipality of La Plata on October 5 of that year. The NU of LP formalized the status of the ensemble in 1958. The quartet has premiered the works of distinguished Argentinian composers such as Alberto Ginastera, √Åstor Piazzolla, Gerardo Gandini and Eduardo Alemann. Its repertoire ranges from classical to the present day. Its current members are: *1st Violin: Jos√© Bondar *2nd Violin: Fernando Favero *Viola: Roberto Regio *Cello: Siro Bellisomi =The wind quintet= The Wind Quintet of the NU of LP was created in 1979 as an instrumental ensemble of the university's radio station. In 1982 the NU of LP officialized it as its own. The Wind Quintet plays, amongst much else, classical music for the public Its repertoire covers composers of the romantic, classical, 20th-century and contemporary composers, which also includes folk and popular works. As of 2005, its members are: *Marcelo Mancuso (flute) *Cristian Cocchiararo (oboe) *Roberto Palomo (clarinet) *Calos Nalli, (horn) *Eduardo Rodriguez (bassoon) =University theater= The Theatre Workshop of the National University of La Plata was created on May 5, 1986. Its stated objective is to promote artistic creativity and research on aesthetics. The group is devoted to experimental productions open to the general public, as well as providing advice and consultancy on various artistic disciplines. The workshop can trace its roots to the theatre group termed \\"Renewal\\", associated with the reformist movement of the 1920s.

Flemington is located 16 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the Municipality of Strathfield. Commercial area Flemington is devoted to commercial developments. The area between Flemington railway station and Parramatta Road is the site of Sydney Markets. The markets feature a number of divisions including Produce, Flowers, Growers, Fresh Food, Motor, Swap & Sell, Paddy's Markets and Sydney Markets Plaza.http://www.sydneymarkets.com.au/ Sydney Markets Sydney Markets Plaza, located near Parramatta Road, features a supermarket, hotel, post office, banks and many specialty shops below an office building. A different section of Sydney Markets Plaza lie to the east of the main market, and is technically in the suburb of Homebush, New South Wales. The residential parts of the suburb formerly known as Flemington are now known as \\"Homebush West\\", although the name \\"Flemington\\" is still often applied to the whole of the suburb. The village commercial centre of Homebush West is located immediately south of Flemington railway station, and are often referred to as the \\"Flemington\\" shops. These include multiple grocery stores, restaurants, cafes, butchers and fishmongers, medical surgeries and pharmacies. Transport Flemington railway station is on the Inner West & Leppington Line of the Sydney Trains network. Parramatta Road and the M4 Western Motorway demarcate the northern border of Flemington. Homebush Bay Drive forms the western border. History This area was originally known Liberty Plains but was called Flemington by John Fleming, who was granted here in 1806. The bush was turned into paddocks and later was the site of a cattle saleyard (which gave its name to Saleyards Creek). In the early 1970s, the Sydney Markets were built at Flemington to relieve the Paddy's Markets at Haymarket, in the city. Since the establishment of Sydney Markets at Flemington in 1975, the residential part of the suburb, south of the railway line became known as Homebush West, named after the separate suburb of Homebush immediately to the east. However, Homebush West is still commonly referred to as \\"Flemington\\". Both the railway station serving the suburb and various organisations and businesses in the suburb still carry the name \\"Flemington\\".

It was ported to the Atari 8-bit family. Raster Blaster resembles the Williams Firepower table from 1980. While not the first pinball game for home computers, Raster Blaster set a higher bar for visual fidelity, and the next several years saw a flurry of Apple II pinball titles: David's Midnight Magic (1982), Night Mission Pinball (1982), and Budge's own Pinball Construction Set (1983). Development Raster Blaster presents a full screen high resolution display of a pinball game table. The 6502-based Apple II was not designed to support fast graphics and collision detection, but Budge solved these problems and the game was visually impressive compared to most Apple II action games of the time. Electronic Arts (EA) was formed that same year, and founder Trip Hawkins was impressed by Budge's titles. He approached Budge (with the help of Apple Computer co-founder Steve Wozniak) and invited him to join the initial group of EA developers. Budge agreed, and became the central figure among EA's designers. Pinball Construction Set became a mainstream hit and the top title in EA's original line-up.

He said that the goddess Amba sustained him. However, the findings of the investigations on him have been kept confidential and viewed with skepticism. He made several media and public appearances. Biography Prahlad Jani was born on 13 August 1929 in Charada village in British India (now in Mehsana district, Gujarat, India). According to Jani, he left his home in Gujarat at the age of seven, and went to live in the jungle. At the age of 12, Jani underwent a spiritual experience and became a follower of the Hindu goddess Amba. From that time, he chose to dress as a female devotee of Amba, wearing a red sari-like garment, jewellery and crimson flowers in his shoulder-length hair. Jani was commonly known as Mataji (\\"[a manifestation of] The Great Mother\\"). Jani believed that the Goddess provided him with water which dropped down through a hole in his palate, which allowed him to live without food or drink. Since the 1970s, Jani had lived as a hermit in a cave in the forest in Gujarat. He died on 26 May 2020 at his native Charada. He was given samadhi in his ashram at Gabbar Hill near Ambaji on 28 May 2020. Investigations Two observational studies and one imaging study of Jani have been conducted. The observational studies were one in 2003 and one in 2010, both involving Dr. Sudhir Shah, a neurologist at the Sterling Hospitals in Ahmedabad, India, who had studied people claiming to have exceptional abilities, including other fasters such as Hira Ratan Manek. In both cases the investigators confirmed Jani's ability to survive healthily without food and water during the testing periods, although neither study was submitted to a scientific journal. When questioned six days into the 2010 experiment, the DRDO spokesperson announced that the study's findings would be \\"confidential\\" until results were established. Uninvolved doctors and other critics have questioned the validity of the studies and stated their belief that, although people can survive for days without food or water, it is not possible to survive for years,\\"Yogi beaten by bear necessities of life without food\\" Glenda Kwek, 14 May 2010, The Sydney Morning Herald, Sydney, Australia. especially since glucose, a substrate critical to brain function, is not provided.Magistretti, Pierre et al. \\"Brain Energy Metabolism \\" American College of Neuropsychopharmacology. 2000. =2003 tests= In 2003, Dr. Sudhir Shah and other physicians at Sterling Hospitals, Ahmedabad, India observed Jani for 10 days. He stayed in a sealed room. Doctors said that he passed no urine or stool during the observation, but that urine appeared to form in the bladder. A hospital spokesperson said that Jani was physically normal, but noted that a hole in the palate was an abnormal condition. The fact that Jani's weight dropped slightly during the 10 days has cast some doubt on his claim to go indefinitely without food. =2010 tests= From 22 April until 6 May 2010, Prahlad Jani was again observed and tested by Dr Sudhir Shah and a team of 35 researchers from the Indian Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences (DIPAS), as well as other organizations. The director of DIPAS said that the results of the observations could \\"tremendously benefit mankind\\", as well as \\"soldiers, victims of calamities and astronauts\\", all of whom may have to survive without food or water for long durations. The tests were again conducted at Sterling Hospitals. Professor Anil Gupta of SRISTI, involved in monitoring the tests, described the team as being \\"intrigued\\" by Jani's kriyas apparently allowing him to control his body's physiological functions. The team studied Jani with daily clinical examinations, blood tests, and scans. Round-the-clock surveillance was reportedly followed using multiple CCTV cameras and personal observation. The researchers say that Jani was taken out of the sealed room for tests and exposure to sun under continuous video recording. After fifteen days of observation during which he reportedly did not eat, drink or go to the toilet, all medical tests on Jani were reported as normal. The doctors reported that although the amount of liquid in Jani's bladder fluctuated and that Jani appeared \\"able to generate urine in his bladder\\", he did not pass urine. Based on Jani's reported levels of leptin and ghrelin, two appetite-related hormones, DRDO researchers posited that Jani may be demonstrating an extreme form of adaptation to starvation and water restriction. DIPAS stated in 2010 that further studies were planned, including investigations into how metabolic waste material is eliminated from Jani's body, from where he gets his energy for sustenance, and how he maintains his hydration status. =2017 Brain Imaging Study= Independent of DRDO studies, IIT Madras team has conducted an imaging study in 2017. They have collected Jani's brain images and measured the size of Pineal and Pituitary glands. The result of the imaging study shows that the size of Jani's Pineal and Pituitary glands are of the same order of a 10-year-old boy. The study results have been published in scientific journals.Raghuprasad, MS et al. =Reactions= Dr. Michael Van Rooyen, director of the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, dismissed the observation results as \\"impossible\\", observing that the bodies of profoundly malnourished people quickly consume their own body's resources, resulting in renal/liver failure, tachycardia and heart strain. A spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association stated that, \\"The bottom line is that even fasting for more than a day can be dangerous. You need food to function.\\" Nutrition researcher Peter Clifton also disagreed with study results, accusing the research team of \\"cheating\\" by allowing Jani to gargle and bathe, and stating that a human of average weight would die after \\"15 to 20 days\\" without water. People who avoid food and water to emulate mystical figures often die. Sanal Edamaruku characterized the experiment as a farce for allowing Jani to move out of the CCTV cameras' field of view, claiming that video footage showed Jani was allowed to receive devotees and to leave the sealed test room for sunbathing. Edamaruku also said that the gargling and bathing activities were insufficiently monitored. Edamaruku was denied access to the site where the tests were conducted in both 2003 and 2010, and accuses Jani of having \\"influential protectors\\" responsible for denying him permission to inspect the project during its operation, despite having been invited to join the test during a live television broadcast. The Indian Rationalist Association observed that individuals making similar claims in the past have been exposed as frauds. In 2010, the prominent scientific sceptic James Randi criticized the studies performed by the Indian government, citing insufficient scrutiny of the subject. He also proposed that if Prahlad Jani could prove his claims, he would receive the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge prize. In September 2010, Dr. Shah announced that scientists from Austria and Germany had offered to visit India to carry out further research on Jani, and scientists from the United States had also offered to join the research. Jani has expressed interest in cooperating in further investigations. Television, video and public appearances In 2006, The Discovery Channel aired a documentary called \\"The Boy with Divine Powers\\" featuring a five-minute interview with Jani and Shah. In 2010, the Independent Television Network (ITN) posted an article and video featuring Prahlad Jani, commenting on the 2010 tests.Indian hermit stuns doctors surviving without food In 2010 Prahlad Jani was featured in an Austrian documentary \\"Am Anfang war das Licht\\" (English title In the Beginning There Was Light). In October 2010, the Italian television station Rai 2 broadcast a program named \\"Voyager\\" which presented an extensive report on Prahlad Jani and the tests.http://www.ilsussidiario.net/News/Programmi-e-ascolti- Tv/2010/10/13/VOYAGER-Anticipazioni-stasera-13-ottobre-2010-In-questa-puntata- Prahlad-Jani-l-uomo-che-non-mangia-e-beve-mai-21-05-Rai-Due/119435/ VOYAGER/ Anticipazioni stasera 13 ottobre 2010.

To an end-user who only deals with names of species, with some awareness that species are assignable to families, it may not be noticeable that there is more than one code, but beyond this basic level these are rather different in the way they work. The successful introduction of two-part names for species by Linnaeus was the start for an ever-expanding system of nomenclature. With all naturalists worldwide adopting this approach to thinking up names there arose several schools of thought about the details. It became ever more apparent that a detailed body of rules was necessary to govern scientific names. From the mid-19th century onwards there were several initiatives to arrive at worldwide-accepted sets of rules. Presently nomenclature codes govern the naming of: * Algae, Fungi and Plants - International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN), which in July 2011 replaced the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN) and the earlier International Rules of Botanical Nomenclature. * Animals - International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) * Bacteria and Archaea - International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (ICNP), which in 2008 replaced the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria (ICNB) * Cultivated plants - International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants (ICNCP) * Plant associations - International Code of Phytosociological Nomenclature (ICPN) * Viruses - The International Code of Virus Classification and Nomenclature (ICVCN); see also virus classification  Differences between codes  Starting point = The starting point, that is the time from which these codes are in effect (usually retroactively), varies from group to group, and sometimes from rank to rank. In botany and mycology the starting point is often 1 May 1753 (Linnaeus, Species plantarum), in zoology 1758 (Linnaeus, Systema Naturae, 10th Edition). On the other hand, bacteriology started anew, making a clean sweep in 1980 (Skerman et al., \\"Approved Lists of Bacterial Names\\"), although maintaining the original authors and dates of publication. Exceptions in botany: * Spermatophyta and Pteridophyta, suprageneric names: 4 August 1789 (Jussieu, Genera plantarum); * Musci (except Sphagnaceae): 1 January 1801 (Hedwig, Species muscorum); * Sphagnaceae and Hepaticae (including Anthocerotae), suprageneric names: 4 August 1789 (Jussieu, Genera plantarum); * (Fungi:) Microsporidia are governed by the ICZN (treated as animals), and see below for fossil fungi; * (Algae:) ** Nostocaceae homocysteae: 1 January 1892 (Gomont, ‚ÄúMonographie des Oscillari√©es‚Äù); ** Nostocaceae heterocysteae: 1 January 1886 (Bornet & Flahault, ‚ÄúR√©vision des Nostocac√©es h√©t√©rocyst√©es‚Äù); ** Desmidiaceae: 1 January 1848 (Ralfs, British Desmidieae); ** Oedogoniaceae: 1 January 1900 (Hirn, ‚ÄúMonographie und Iconographie der Oedogoniaceen‚Äù); * Fossil plants, algae (diatoms excepted) and fungi: 31 December 1820 (Sternberg, Flora der Vorwelt). Exceptions in zoology:ICZN - International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (1999). International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. Fourth Edition. The International Trust for Zoological Nomenclature, London, UK. 306 pp., . * Spiders: 1757 (Clerck, Aranei Svecici). = Workings = There are also differences in the way codes work. For example, the ICN (the code for algae, fungi and plants) forbids tautonyms, while the ICZN, (the animal code) allows them. = Terminology = These codes differ in terminology, and there is a long-term project to \\"harmonize\\" this. For instance, the ICN uses \\"valid\\" in \\"valid publication of a name\\" (= the act of publishing a formal name), with \\"establishing a name\\" as the ICZN equivalent. The ICZN uses \\"valid\\" in \\"valid name\\" (= \\"correct name\\"), with \\"correct name\\" as the ICN equivalent. Harmonization is making very limited progress. = Types = There are differences in respect of what kinds of types are used. The bacteriological code prefers living type cultures, but allows other kinds. There has been ongoing debate regarding which kind of type is more useful in a case like cyanobacteria. Other codesBioCode= A more radical approach was made in 1997 when the IUBS/IUMS International Committee on Bionomenclature (ICB) presented the long debated Draft BioCode, proposed to replace all existing Codes with an harmonization of them. The originally planned implementation date for the BioCode draft was January 1, 2000, but agreement to replace the existing Codes was not reached. In 2011 a revised BioCode was proposed that, instead of replacing the existing Codes, would provide a unified context for them, referring to them when necessary. Changes in the existing codes are slowly being made in the proposed directions.DL Hawksworth (2011) BioCode 2011. Introduction. http://www.bionomenclature.net/biocode2011.htmlWerner Greuter (2011) BioCode 2011. Explanatory prologue. http://www.bionomenclature.net/biocode2011.html =Phylocode= Some authors encountered problems in using the Linnean system in phylogenetic classification.de Queiroz, K.; Gauthier, J. (1990). Phylogeny as a Central Principle in Taxonomy: Phylogenetic Definitions of Taxon Names. Syst. Zool. (39): 307‚Äì322. doi:10.2307/2992353 http://vertebrates.si.edu/herps/herps_pdfs/deQueiroz_pdfs/1990deQ_GauSZ.pdf. Another Code in development since 1998 is the PhyloCode, which would regulate what their creators called phylogenetic nomenclature instead of the traditional Linnaean nomenclature (that is, it requires phylogenetic definitions as a \\"type\\" attached to every name, and does not contain mandatory ranks). The Code and the accompanying volume (meant to serve as a list of not- suppressed names and a new starting point, like the 1980s Approved Lists of Bacterial NamesVBD Skerman, Vicki McGowan, and PHA Sneath, 1989. Approved Lists of Bacterial Names, Amended edition. Washington (DC): ASM Press functions relative to the Bacteriological Code, much like Systema naturae functions relative to the Zoological Code), is however still in the draft stage, and it is uncertain when, or even if, the code will see any form of implementation. Ambiregnal protists Some protists, sometimes called ambiregnal protists, have been considered to be both protozoa and algae, or protozoa and fungi, and names for these have been published under either or both of the ICZN and the ICN. The resulting double language throughout protist classification schemes resulted in confusion.Adl, S. M. et al. Diversity, Nomenclature, and Taxonomy of Protists. Systematic Biology, p. 684-689, 2007, .Elbr√§chter, M. et al. Establishing an Agenda for Calcareous Dinoflagellates Research (Thoracosphaeraceae, Dinophyceae) including a nomenclatural synopsis of generic names. Taxon 57, p. 1289‚Äì1303, 2008, Groups claimed by protozoologists and phycologists include euglenids, dinoflagellates, cryptomonads, haptophytes, glaucophytes, many heterokonts (e.g., chrysophytes, raphidophytes, silicoflagellates, some xanthophytes, proteromonads), some monadoid green algae (volvocaleans and prasinophytes), choanoflagellates, bicosoecids, ebriids and chlorarachniophytes. Slime molds, plasmodial forms and other \\"fungus-like\\" organisms claimed by protozoologists and mycologists include mycetozoans, plasmodiophorids, acrasids, and labyrinthulomycetess. Fungi claimed by protozoologists and mycologists include chytrids, blastoclads, and the gut fungi. Other problematic groups are the Cyanobacteria and Microsporidia. Unregulated taxa The zoological code does not regulate names of taxa lower than subspecies or higher than superfamily. There are many attempts to introduce some order on the nomenclature of these taxa,Dubois, A. (2006). Proposed Rules for the incorporation of nomina of higher-ranked zoological taxa in the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. 2. The proposed Rules and their rationale.

Circumscriptional names of higher taxa in Hexapoda. Bionomina, 1, 15-55, . The botanical code is applied primarily to the ranks of family and below. There are some rules for names above the rank of family, but the principle of priority does not apply to them, and the principle of typification is optional. These names may be either automatically typified names or be descriptive names. In some circumstances, a taxon has two possible names (e.g., Chrysophyceae Pascher, 1914, nom. descrip.; Hibberd, 1976, nom. typificatum). Descriptive names are problematic, once that, if a taxon is split, it is not obvious which new group takes the existing name. Meanwhile, with typified names, the existing name is taken by the new group that still bears the type of this name. However, typified names present special problems for microorganisms.

In the , Kelvin Grove had a population of 7,927 people with a median age of 27. Kelvin Grove is a suburb in the City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. In the , Kelvin Grove had a population of 7,927 people.  Geography  Kelvin Grove is approximately from the CBD. This hilly suburb takes its name from Kelvingrove Park in Glasgow, Scotland. It is primarily residential with tree-lined streets and some commercial and light industrial activities along its main thoroughfare, Kelvin Grove Road. La Boite Theatre Company, Queensland's second largest theatre company, operates from the Roundhouse Theatre on the Kelvin Grove campus of the Queensland University of Technology. In common with many inner suburbs of Brisbane, the suburb has a mixture of traditional \\"Queenslander\\" homes, some post-war worker's cottages and more modern apartment blocks. History Kelvin Grove Road c.1890 Dr Joseph Bancroft built a residence in the area in 1865 which he called Kelvin Grove after a park in Glasgow that he remembered fondly. This is the origin of the suburb's name. Kelvin Grove Road State School opened in 1875. In 1887 it was split into Kelvin Grove Boys State School and Kelvin Grove Girls and Infants State School. On 31 January 1950 there was a merger creating Kelvin Grove State School for the older boys and girls and Kelvin Grove Infants State School for the younger boys and girls. In 1961 the Infants School was absorbed back into Kelvin Grove State School. In January 2002 Kelvin Grove State School and Kelvin Grove State High School merged to become Kelvin Grove State College. Kelvin Grove was part of the Shire of Ithaca (later the Town of Ithaca) before the town was amalgamated into the City of Greater Brisbane in 1925. In 1901 electric trams commenced operations along Kelvin Grove Road, running to the city. The tram service ceased in December 1968 and since that time diesel and more recently compressed natural gas buses operated by the Brisbane City Council have served the suburb. Electric trolley-buses, also operated by the Brisbane City Council connected the suburb with Fortitude Valley, via Herston between 1953 and 1969. In August 1914, 46 subdivided allotments of \\"Bancroft Park Estate\\" were advertised to be auctioned by Isles Love & Co. A map advertising the auction states the estate was fronting the Kelvin Grove tram line and easy walking distance of town. This property was situated at the Three Mile Bridge, on the Kelvin Grove tram line and waswell known as the former residence of the late Dr Bancroft. Kelvin Grove State High School opened on 23 January 1961. In January 2002 Kelvin Grove State School and Kelvin Grove State High School merged to become Kelvin Grove State College. Following the closure of the Gona Barracks in 1998, the site was used as the basis of an urban renewal program resulting in the Kelvin Grove Urban Village which integrates the Kelvin Grove campus of Queensland University of Technology with residential and commercial buildings. The Kelvin Grove Urban Village was officially opened by Queensland Premier Peter Beattie on 24 November 2003. Queensland Academy for Creative Industries opened in 2007. In the , Kelvin Grove had a population of 7,927 people. Heritage listings Kelvin Grove has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Kelvin Grove, Red Hill, Paddington: Ithaca Embankments * 3, 7,12, 25 & 26 Gona Parade: Gona Barracks * 95-107 Musk Avenue: Student residences * 104A Kelvin Grove Road: Kelvin Grove Fig Trees and Air Raid Shelter * 188 L'Estrange Terrace: AMA House Demographics In the , Kelvin Grove recorded a population of 6,018 people, 52% female and 48% male. The median age of the Kelvin Grove population was 27 years of age, 10 years below the Australian median. 60.8% of people living in Kelvin Grove were born in Australia, compared to the national average of 69.8%; the next most common countries of birth were China 3.6%, Saudi Arabia 3.4%, England 2.9%, India 2.4%, New Zealand 2.3%. 69.4% of people spoke only English at home; the next most common languages were 4.6% Arabic, 3.7% Mandarin, 1.7% Cantonese, 1.5% Malay, 1.1% Korean. Education Kelvin Grove State College is a government primary and secondary (Prep-12) school for boys and girls at L'Estrange Terrace (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 2862 students with 218 teachers (194 full-time equivalent) and 81 non- teaching staff (58 full-time equivalent). It includes a special education program. Queensland Academy for Creative Industries is a government secondary (10-12) school for boys and girls at 61 Musk Avenue (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 295 students with 40 teachers (34 full-time equivalent) and 22 non-teaching staff (13 full-time equivalent).

It is notable for the creation of Devil's garden. Using its own herbicide they kill off all the plants in an area except for the myrmecophytes, or ant-plants, in which they reside. Ant‚Äìplant mutualism M. schumanni live in large clearings in the rainforest, called devil's gardens, where there is little to no bio-diversity compared to the surrounding area. There are only one to three species of plants found in these areas consisting of Cordia nodosa, Tococa guianensis, Duroia hirsuta or Clidemia heterophylla. The few studies of the mutualism between M. schumanni‚ÄìD. hirsuta have incorrectly concluded that these clearings are formed by allelopathy on the part of D. hirsuta. It was established that worker ants were injecting leaves with formic acid, a toxin commonly produced in ant species, and the plants started to die within 24 hours. Lemon ants are the only known insect to use formic acid as a herbicide. By killing other plants, the lemon ants provide themselves with a nest site, usually residing in D. hirsuta. Researchers estimate that the largest garden observed, contains 328 trees over 1,300 square meters and is around 800 years old. Name Lemon ants get their name from the lemony taste of acids produced as part of a glandular chemical defense system. When crushed or attacked, citronellal pheromones are created to communicate alarm to nearby individuals, which also produces a citrus odor.

Colonel Roberto Federico Souper Onfray (May 2, 1927 in Angol, Chile ‚Äì August 24, 2015 in Santiago of Chile) was a Chilean military officer who launched an unsuccessful coup d'√©tat against the Allende administration, surrounding the presidential palace with a tank regiment. Twenty-two civilians were killed during the brief coup attempt, including Leonardo Henrichsen, a Swedish-Argentine news photographer filming the events. Death date of Roberto Souper Onfray Early life Souper was married to Mar√≠a Eugenia Wilshaw. He attended the Chilean military academy following his attendance at the Jesuit- run secondary school, \\"San Ignacio\\" in Santiago. After being commissioned as an Army officer he rose through the ranks and served with units including the \\"H√∫sares\\" of Angol, and the \\"Granaderos\\" of Iquique. Souper's family was characterised as being of a \\"military caste\\" following the entry of the first Souper on the Chilean historical scene, when colonel Robert Souper Howard (born in Harwich, Britain) played a prominent role in the 1879 War of the Pacific. Souper had one son, Gustavo, who did not follow the family military tradition, and instead operated a small hotel in Puerto Bories, in the XII Regi√≥n of Chile (Magallanes). Failed coup attempt The aforementioned attempted coup, known as the Tanquetazo, took place on June 29, 1973 and was widely reported in international wire and news media. At the time, Souper was the commander of the \\"Regimiento Blindado N¬∫2\\" Chilean Army tank force in the Santiago region. Souper's failure is considered significant in that it provided the military with a valuable lesson as to what conditions were necessary for a coup to succeed. There is no reliable evidence that the US actively assisted or even approved of Souper's tanquetazo and given the absurdly uncoordinated nature of the event, and the lack of support for it within the rest of the Chilean military, such a connection is considered unlikely. However, there is considerable published information about the Chilean organisation \\"Patria y Libertad\\" that did promote the coup attempt and members of that group notoriously took refuge in the embassy of Ecuador when the coup's failure was made clear. Souper's cousin, Carlos Souper Quinteros, along with Roberto's brothers Jaime and Patricio, were active members of \\"Patria y Libertad.\\" Dictatorship era Souper, detained under the Allende administration and under prosecution for sedition in a military court, was released following the successful coup on September 11, 1973. He then became an agent for the Santiago regional intelligences services (Divisi√≥n de Inteligencia Regional de la Divisi√≥n de Inteligencia Metropolitana). Though declassified CIA documents do not identify any American involvement in the tanquetazo, Souper was named by the CIA as early as August 1971 as one of eight known officers predisposed to oppose the government of Salvador Allende. Later life In 2001 Souper was a director of the symbolic armoured cavalry unit known as \\"Coronel Santiago Bueras\\". In 2004 the Chilean newspaper \\"La Cuarta\\" identified Souper as a probable participant in the death of Chilean musician and songwriter V√≠ctor Jara, according to the finding of special judge Juan Carlos Urrutia. In 2005 the daughter of the Swedish-Argentine filmmaker Leonardo Henrichsen, killed near the presidential palace during the \\"Tanquetazo\\" in 1973, initiated legal proceedings in Chile against those responsible for the death of her father. The story was carried in the Argentine media. In 2012 Souper was charged in Chile, along with several others, with the murder of Chilean folk singer Victor Jara in 1973. At the time, Souper was reported to be in a rest home, suffering from Alzheimer's. The edition of October 11, 2013 of \\"Diario UChile\\" indicated prosecution of Roberto Souper (as an accomplice) and other defendants, for aggravated homicide.

This risk can arise if the holder has done any of the following: * Borrowed cash from the counterparty to buy financial instruments, * Borrowed financial instruments to sell them short, * Entered into a derivative contract. The collateral for a margin account can be the cash deposited in the account or securities provided, and represents the funds available to the account holder for further share trading. On United States futures exchanges, margins were formerly called performance bonds. Most of the exchanges today use SPAN (\\"Standard Portfolio Analysis of Risk\\") methodology, which was developed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in 1988, for calculating margins for options and futures.  Margin account  A margin account is a loan account with a broker which can be used for share trading. The funds available under the margin loan are determined by the broker based on the securities owned and provided by the trader, which act as collateral for the loan. The broker usually has the right to change the percentage of the value of each security it will allow towards further advances to the trader, and may consequently make a margin call if the balance available falls below the amount actually utilised. In any event, the broker will usually charge interest and other fees on the amount drawn on the margin account. If the cash balance of a margin account is negative, the amount is owed to the broker, and usually attracts interest. If the cash balance is positive, the money is available to the account holder to reinvest, or may be withdrawn by the holder or left in the account and may earn interest. In terms of futures and cleared derivatives, the margin balance would refer to the total value of collateral pledged to the CCP (central counterparty clearing) and or futures commission merchants.  Margin buying  Margin buying refers to the buying of securities with cash borrowed from a broker, using the bought securities as collateral. This has the effect of magnifying any profit or loss made on the securities. The securities serve as collateral for the loan. The net value‚Äîthe difference between the value of the securities and the loan‚Äîis initially equal to the amount of one's own cash used. This difference has to stay above a minimum margin requirement, the purpose of which is to protect the broker against a fall in the value of the securities to the point that the investor can no longer cover the loan. Margin lending became popular in the late 1800 as a means to finance railroads. In the 1920s, margin requirements were loose. In other words, brokers required investors to put in very little of their own money, whereas today, the Federal Reserve's margin requirement (under Regulation T) limits debt to 50 percent. During the 1920s leverage rates of up to 90 percent debt were not uncommon. When the stock market started to contract, many individuals received margin calls. They had to deliver more money to their brokers or their shares would be sold. Since many individuals did not have the equity to cover their margin positions, their shares were sold, causing further market declines and further margin calls. This was one of the major contributing factors which led to the Stock Market Crash of 1929, which in turn contributed to the Great Depression. However, as reported in Peter Rappoport and Eugene N. White's 1994 paper published in The American Economic Review, \\"Was the Crash of 1929 Expected\\", all sources indicate that beginning in either late 1928 or early 1929, \\"margin requirements began to rise to historic new levels. The typical peak rates on brokers' loans were 40‚Äì50 percent. Brokerage houses followed suit and demanded higher margin from investors\\".  Short selling  Short selling refers to the selling of securities that the trader does not own, borrowing them from a broker, and using the cash as collateral. This has the effect of reversing any profit or loss made on the securities. The initial cash deposited by the trader, together with the amount obtained from the sale, serve as collateral for the loan. The net value‚Äîthe difference between the cash amount and the value of loan security‚Äîis initially equal to the amount of one's own cash used. This difference has to stay above a minimum margin requirement, the purpose of which is to protect the broker against a rise in the value of the borrowed securities to the point that the investor can no longer cover the loan.  Types of margin requirements  * The current liquidating margin is the value of a security's position if the position were liquidated now. In other words, if the holder has a short position, this is the money needed to buy back; if they are long, it is the money they can raise by selling it. * The variation margin or mark to market is not collateral, but a daily payment of profits and losses. Futures are marked-to-market every day, so the current price is compared to the previous day's price. The profit or loss on the day of a position is then paid to or debited from the holder by the futures exchange. This is possible, because the exchange is the central counterparty to all contracts, and the number of long contracts equals the number of short contracts. Certain other exchange traded derivatives, such as options on futures contracts, are marked-to-market in the same way. * The seller of an option has the obligation to deliver the underlying security associated with the option when it is exercised. To ensure they can fulfill this obligation, they have to deposit collateral. This premium margin is equal to the premium that they would need to pay to buy back the option and close out their position. * Additional margin is intended to cover a potential fall in the value of the position on the following trading day. This is calculated as the potential loss in a worst-case scenario. * SMA and portfolio margins offer alternative rules for U.S. and NYSE regulatory margin requirements.  Margin strategies  Enhanced leverage is a strategy offered by some brokers that provides 4:1 or 6+:1 leverage. This requires maintaining two sets of accounts, long and short. ;Example 1: An investor sells a put option, where the buyer has the right to require the seller to buy his 100 shares in Universal Widgets S.A. at 90¬¢. He receives an option premium of 14¬¢. The value of the option is 14¬¢, so this is the premium margin. The exchange has calculated, using historical prices, that the option value will not exceed 17¬¢ the next day, with 99% certainty. Therefore, the additional margin requirement is set at 3¬¢, and the investor has to post at least 14¬¢ (obtained from the sale) + 3¬¢ = 17¬¢ in his margin account as collateral. ;Example 2: Futures contracts on sweet crude oil closed the day at $65. The exchange sets the additional margin requirement at $2, which the holder of a long position pays as collateral in his margin account. A day later, the futures close at $66. The exchange now pays the profit of $1 in the mark-to-market to the holder. The margin account still holds only the $2. ;Example 3: An investor is long 50 shares in Universal Widgets Ltd, trading at 120 pence (¬£1.20) each. The broker sets an additional margin requirement of 20 pence per share, so ¬£10 for the total position. The current liquidating margin is currently ¬£60 \\"in favour of the investor\\". The minimum margin requirement is now -¬£60 + ¬£10 = -¬£50. In other words, the investor can run a deficit of ¬£50 in his margin account and still fulfil his margin obligations. This is the same as saying he can borrow up to ¬£50 from the broker.  Initial and maintenance margin requirements  The initial margin requirement is the amount of collateral required to open a position. Thereafter, the collateral required until the position is closed is the maintenance requirement. The maintenance requirement is the minimum amount of collateral required to keep the position open and is generally lower than the initial requirement. This allows the price to move against the margin without forcing a margin call immediately after the initial transaction. When the total value of the collateral dips below the maintenance margin requirement, the position holder must pledge additional collateral to bring their total balance back up to or above the initial margin requirement. On instruments determined to be especially risky, however, either regulators, the exchange, or the broker may set the maintenance requirement higher than normal or equal to the initial requirement to reduce their exposure to the risk accepted by the trader. For speculative futures and derivatives clearing accounts, futures commission merchants may charge a premium or margin multiplier to exchange requirements. This is typically an additional 10%‚Äì25%.  Margin call  The broker may at any time revise the value of the collateral securities (margin) after the estimation of the risk, based, for example, on market factors. If this results in the market value of the collateral securities for a margin account falling below the revised margin, the broker or exchange immediately issues a \\"margin call\\", requiring the investor to bring the margin account back into line. To do so, the investor must either pay funds (the call) into the margin account, provide additional collateral, or dispose some of the securities. If the investor fails to bring the account back into line, the broker can sell the investor's collateral securities to bring the account back into line. If a margin call occurs unexpectedly, it can cause a domino effect of selling, which will lead to other margin calls and so forth, effectively crashing an asset class or group of asset classes. The \\"Bunker Hunt Day\\" crash of the silver market on Silver Thursday, March 27, 1980 is one such example. This situation most frequently happens as a result of an adverse change in the market value of the leveraged asset or contract. It could also happen when the margin requirement is raised, either due to increased volatility or due to legislation. In extreme cases, certain securities may cease to qualify for margin trading; in such a case, the brokerage will require the trader to either fully fund their position, or to liquidate it.  Price of stock for margin calls  The minimum margin requirement, sometimes called the maintenance margin requirement, is the ratio set for: *(Stock Equity ‚àí Leveraged Dollars) to Stock Equity *Stock Equity being the stock price multiplied by the number of shares bought, and leveraged dollars being the amount borrowed in the margin account. *E.g., An investor bought 1,000 shares of ABC company each priced at $50. If the initial margin requirement were 60%: *Stock Equity: $50 √ó 1,000 = $50,000 *Leveraged Dollars or amount borrowed: ($50 √ó 1,000) √ó (100% ‚àí 60%) = $20,000 The maintenance margin requirement uses the variables above to form a ratio that investors have to abide by in order to keep the account active. Assume the maintenance margin requirement is 25%. That means the customer has to maintain a net value equal to 25% of the total stock equity. That means they have to maintain net equity of $50,000 √ó 0.25 = $12,500. So at what price would the investor be getting a margin call? For stock price P the stock equity will be (in this example) 1,000P. *(Current Market Value ‚àí Amount Borrowed) / Current Market Value = 25% *(1,000P - 20,000) / 1000P = 0.25 *(1,000P - 20,000) = 250P * 750P = $20,000 * P = $20,000/750 = $26.66 / share So if the stock price drops from $50 to $26.66, investors will be called to add additional funds to the account to make up for the loss in stock equity. Alternatively, one can calculate P using \\\\textstyle P=P_0\\\\frac{(1-\\\\text{initial margin requirement})}{(1-\\\\text{maintenance margin requirement})} where P0 is the initial price of the stock. Using the same example to demonstrate this: P=\\\\$50\\\\frac{(1-0.6)}{(1-0.25)} = \\\\$26.66.  Reduced margins  Margin requirements are reduced for positions that offset each other. For instance spread traders who have offsetting futures contracts do not have to deposit collateral both for their short position and their long position. The exchange calculates the loss in a worst-case scenario of the total position. Similarly an investor who creates a collar has reduced risk since any loss on the call is offset by a gain in the stock, and a large loss in the stock is offset by a gain on the put; in general, covered calls have less strict requirements than naked call writing.  Margin-equity ratio  The margin-equity ratio is a term used by speculators, representing the amount of their trading capital that is being held as margin at any particular time. Traders would rarely (and unadvisedly) hold 100% of their capital as margin. The probability of losing their entire capital at some point would be high. By contrast, if the margin- equity ratio is so low as to make the trader's capital equal to the value of the futures contract itself, then they would not profit from the inherent leverage implicit in futures trading. A conservative trader might hold a margin-equity ratio of 15%, while a more aggressive trader might hold 40%.  Return on margin  Return on margin (ROM) is often used to judge performance because it represents the net gain or net loss compared to the exchange's perceived risk as reflected in required margin. ROM may be calculated (realized return) / (initial margin). The annualized ROM is equal to : (ROM + 1)(1/trade duration in years) \\\\- 1 For example, if a trader earns 10% on margin in two months, that would be about 77% annualized : Annualized ROM = (ROM +1)1/(2/12) \\\\- 1 that is, Annualized ROM = 1.16 \\\\- 1 = 77% Sometimes, return on margin will also take into account peripheral charges such as brokerage fees and interest paid on the sum borrowed. The margin interest rate is usually based on the broker's call.

And commenting on the same list, R Morton Smith also writes: ‚ÄúThe names Kamboja Aupamanyava, Sati Austraksi and Madragara Saungayani suggest a North-west connection for the main branch of Vamsa Brahmana.Dates and Dynasties: Part III : the Brahmans, 2000, p 79, R Morton Smith - Brahmans.

Kamboja Aupamanyava appears as the first \\"Aupamanyava\\"' (i.e. son or descendant of Upamanyu). This Kamboja Aupamanyava was the guru of Anadaja Chandhanayana who in turn was the guru of Bhanumant Aupamanyava.Vamsa Brahmania 16-15. Bhanumant Aupamanyava had instructed Urjayant Aupamanyava.Vamsa Brahmana 15-14 Vedic teachers Bhanumanta Aupamanyava and Urjayant Aupamanyava of the Vamsa Brahmana list were probably the son and grandson of Kamboja Aupamanyava. Aupamanyava/Upamanyu Gotra Upamanyu also is one of the gotras of Hindu brahmins. The people with Upamanyu gotra live in far western part of Nepal and eastern Parts of Jammu & Kashmir. They are basically present just below the Mount Kailash as they pray to Lord Shiva only. However, according to Dr D. C. Sircar, Upamanyu gotra is not found in early Sanskrit literature and it is difficult to determine at this time whether it is a mistake for Aupamanyava gotra.Epigraphia Indica, XXXIII, p 193. Prof B. N. Datta comments: \\"...In the list of Brahmana gotras mentioned in the Matsya-Purana,Matasya Ourana Ch. 195, Sl. 336. the name \\"Kamboja\\" is to be found. It is said to be an offshoot of the Vrigu (Bhrigus) gotras. This means that a Rishi hailing from the Kamboja tribe was also founder of a Brahmanical class.......Weber says that the appearance of the name of Kamboja (an Indian-sounding name in Vedic text) as a Sama theologianVedic teacher Kamboja Aupamanyava mentioned in Vamsa Brahmana, 18. is analogous of the discovery of the name of Gautama in Zoroastrian Mithra-Yesht.Hymn to Mithra.Windischmann, Mithra, pp 29, 79.Indische Studien, herausg, 1858, p 356, Albrecht Friedrich Weber; Monatsberichte der K√∂niglichen preussische Akademie des Wissenschaften zu Berlin, 1858, p 5101, K√∂niglich Preussische Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin. Upamanyu was of Kamboja descent, and Ushtaxri (Sati Austrakshi) According to Vamsa Brahmana of Sama-Veda, Sati Aushtrakshi was the teacher of Madaragara Saungayanai. Madragara Saungayani was the guru of Kamboja Aupamanyava who in turn was the guru of Anandaja Chandhanayana. It appears that sage Ushtaxri/Ushtakshri was one of the two gurus of Sati Aushtrakshi, the second being Susravasa Varshaganya (See Vamsa Brahamana verses 18-22) was probably of Bactrian origin. Further, the name of prominent Rishi like Atharva sounds like Atharavan or Atharvan, the Persian fire-cult priest. The names of Atharva and Angirasa are connected with the introduction of fire-cult amongst the Vedic people. In this case, we find another infiltration of the foreign element (Kambojas etc.) in the ethnic composition of the Vedic Aryas\\" .Dialectics of Hindu Ritualism, 1956, p 59, 60, 132, BhupendranƒÅtha Datta.

It includes a contemporary carillon. The Park is administered by Olympiapark M√ºnchen GmbH, a holding company fully owned by the state capital of Munich. Location and structure The use of the term Olympiapark to designate the overall area has prevailed as a semiofficial practice, but no official name for the entire area exists. The general area comprises four separate sub- areas:Otto Haas, Wolfgang K√∂sler (Red.): Offizieller Olympiaf√ºhrer der Spiele der XX. Olympiade M√ºnchen 1972. Organisationskomitee f√ºr die Spiele der XX. Olympiade M√ºnchen 1972. Atlas Verlag, M√ºnchen 1972. * Olympic Area: Includes the Olympic sports facilities such as the Olympic Stadium and the Olympic Hall with Olympic Tower. Also in this area are the Aquatic Center and Olympic Event Hall. * Olympic Village, comprising two villages, one for male and one for female athletes. * Olympia-Pressestadt, today the home of the Olympia Shopping Center. Strictly speaking, this portion belongs to the area of the Moosach district. * Olympic Park, adjoining the Olympic Area to the south, it includes the Olympic Hill and Olympic Lake. The park is located in the Milbertshofen-Am Hart borough near BMW Group headquarters and the \\"Uptown\\" skyscraper of O2. Georg-Br√§uchle-Ring divides the area into two halves: Olympic Village and Olympia Pressestadt to the north and Olympic Area and Olympic Park to the south. HistoryThird Reich= In the 1930s the Nazi Party planned to develop Munich as the \\"Capital of the Movement,\\" with this area to serve as the central slaughterhouse and marketplace of the city. The Second World War hindered implementation of this plan. Up until 1939, Oberwiesenfeld has largely been used as an airfield. =Post-WWII years= After 1945, the Oberwiesenfeld area remained fallow, and was known as a \\"Tr√ºmmerberg,\\" which in German refers to a hill erected from the rubble resulting from the destruction caused by bombings during the war. Following the war, the US Army occupied this area and had facilities at the Oberwiesefeld. In October 1957, the Army housed most of the refugees from the Hungarian Revolution in a camp at this facility. Apart from infrastructure projects such as the Oberwiesenfeld Ice Rink, the area remained largely vacant during the post-war decades and presented an ideal site for the construction of the Olympic Stadium and complex. =Preparing for the Olympics= After the International Olympic Committee awarded Munich the Olympic Games in 1966, plans were solidified for the urban redevelopment of the Oberwiesenfeld area. The old airfield, intensely used up until 1939, lost its importance once the Munich- Riem airport was opened that year and expanded during the next three decades. As a result, Oberwiesenfeld airfield remained largely idle. Detail of the tensile membrane roof Germany chose the concept of a \\"green Olympic Games\\", with an emphasis on democratic ideals. Officials sought to integrate optimism toward the future with a positive attitude toward technology, and in so doing set aside memories of the past, such as the Olympic Games of 1936 in Berlin under Hitler. The architecture firm of G√ºnther Behnisch and its partners developed a comprehensive master plan for the sports and recreation area, which was under construction from 1968 until 1972. The landscape layout was designed by landscape architect G√ºnther Grzimek. The eye-catching tensile structure that covers much of the park was designed by German architect and engineer Frei Otto with G√ºnther Behnisch. In all, the project cost 1.35 billion German marks to complete. The name \\"Olympiapark\\" was related to the city's administrative commission practice for naming metro stations along the U- and S-Bahn (subway and metropolitan railroad) routes in the city area. On 3 November 1969 it had chosen the name \\"Olympiapark\\" for the subway station at the Olympic village, set on the U3 line of the Munich U-Bahn. This naming decision was based on the idea that the name \\"Olympiapark\\" related well to the central theme of a \\"green Olympic Games\\". It also related to the central function of the U-Bahn station, which, together with the bus station, served all sports venues and important sectors of the area. The term quickly entered into quasi-official common parlance, and consequently into media use. In most situations, the meaning established by the administrative commission is used to describe the entire area, not just the U-Bahn station, as was originally intended.  Transportation Using public transportation, the Munich U-Bahn's U3 line provides a direct route: From M√ºnchner Freiheit (a plaza in the Munich district of Schwabing, located on Leopoldstra√üe), the line connects to Olympiapark via Schwabing and the midtown area. In 2007, the U3 line was extended to continue on to Oberwiesenfeld station at the northern end of the Olympic Village and Olympia-Einkaufszentrum mall at the far areas of the Park. The continuation to Moosach, where the line connects to the S1 S-Bahn line, was completed in 2010. Olympiazentrum U-Bahn station is a central stop for the MVG bus line. The southern and western portions of the Olympiapark will also be connected via Munich tram lines 12, 20, 21, and 27. As these areas are remote from the northern part of Olympiapark, they are primarily of interest for the annual Tollwood music festival held there each summer. After the 1972 Olympic Games, the Olympiastadion Station was disconnected from regular networks. It was used for some events, but the station was closed in 1988 and the tracks taken up in 2003. It has been abandoned and continues to decay. The Olympiapark is accessible by car via Mittlerer Ring motorway. The Olympic Village is closed off from car traffic. Olympic Area in detail Public viewing during FIFA World Cup 2006 The Olympic Area lies south of Georg- Brauchle-Ring and north of the Olympiasee lake; it is the smallest portion of the entire Olympiapark area. It comprises the following competition sites: =Olympic Stadium= opening match of the finals tournament of 2006 FIFA World Cup The central ctadium, constructed from 1968 to 1972, was designed by the architecture firm of Behnisch and Partners. It is currently home to the highest number of staged national and international competitions in Germany. Originally constructed to hold 80,000 visitors, this number was reduced at the end of the 1990s to 69,000 due to security concerns. After the Olympic Games, the Stadium was used primarily for football matches and served as the home stadium for the football teams FC Bayern M√ºnchen and TSV 1860 M√ºnchen. Since the opening of the Allianz Arena in 2005, the site is used almost exclusively for cultural events. Olympic Hall and Aquatic Center = Olympic Hall = Also designed by the architecture firm of Behnisch and Partners, Olympic Hall is a sport and recreational facility located northeast of the Olympic Stadium. Its capacity is 12,150 with seats, or 14,000 without seats. = Small Olympic Hall = Smaller event facility at the Olympic Hall for up to 1,000 seated individuals, according to stage size. = Aquatic Center = This venue became an integral part of Olympic history when the US swimmer Mark Spitz won 7 gold medals there during the 1972 Munich Games. This amounted to a remarkable comeback for Mark Spitz, who had fallen short of the 5 gold medals expected of him at the 1968 Mexico Olympics. The venue also saw significant success by the young women's team of the GDR, which was later found - albeit, the matter was essentially an open secret - to be the result of an extensive doping programme. One notable feature of the Munich Schwimmhalle is the way in which the cobbled paths leading to the venue continue under the canopy as far as the top of the seating area, thus creating the genuine impression of walking in off the street to one's seat. The venue is available both to swimming teams and also to the public. =Olympic Ice Sports Center= The Olympic Icestadion was built from April 1965 by the plans of Rolf Sch√ºtze and opened on 12 February 1967 with the ice hockey game between FC Bayern Munich and SC Riessersee. After using it for the 1969 World Table Tennis Championships, the Icestadion was used for the Olympic Summer games 1972 for the Boxsports. The stadium has a capacity for 6,142 visitorshttp://www.redbullmuenchen.de/stadion and is used for the games of the team of EHC Red Bull M√ºnchen at the Deutsche Eishockey Liga. On the left site of the Icestadion stands an open air ice skating rink. In 1980 it was decided to build a roof over the open air rink in order to have it operational during the whole year independent of the weather conditions.Tensinet The German architectural firm Ackermann und Partner designed an elegant light-weight tensile structure spanning 100 meters length- wise. The building was completed in 1983. In 2004 the ice skating rink was closed and is now used to play Indoorsoccer. On the right side of the Icestadion 1991 the new training hall for the Icesport world championship was built over the parking area after the plans of Kurt Ackermann = Velodrome Olympic Tower= Olympiaturm The Olympiaturm has an overall height of 291 m and a weight of 52,500 tonnes. At a height of 190 m there is an observation platform as well as a small rock and roll museum housing various memorabilia. Since its opening in 1968 the tower has registered over 35 million visitors (as of 2004). At a height of 182 m there is a revolving restaurant that seats 230 people. A full revolution takes 53 minutes. The tower has one Deutsche Telekom maintenance elevator with a speed of 4 m/s, as well as two visitor lifts with a speed of 7 m/s which have a capacity of about 30 people per cabin. The travel time from the ground to the viewing platform is about 30 seconds. = Olympic Village = This was the site of the Munich massacre in the second week of the Games, when eleven of the Israeli team and a West German policeman were murdered by Black September Palestinian terrorists. * Olympic Village * Student District = Olympia Pressestadt = The Olympia Pressestadt lies west of the Olympiapark between Landshuter Allee in the east and Riesstra√üe in the west. It is the site of the former media center and today provides regular housing.  Carillon  The carillon, built in 1972, was one of five carillons in Bavaria. Rather than occupying a traditional bell tower, it was set on an open framework with the bells exposed to view. It was built for the 1972 Summer Olympics on Coubertinplatz, the central square in the Olympic Park. It was made by the Dutch bell foundry Eijsbouts and has a range of 50 bells (originally 49 bells, 1991 retrofit a Cis bell). In 2007, the Olympic Carillon was dismantled due to restructuring measures in the Olympic Park. It was reinstalled in 2012, with American carilloneur Jim Saenger \\"ringing in\\" the rebuilt carillon with a concert on April 16, 2012.https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-apr-16-2012-carillon-at- olympic-park-in-munich-west-germany-rung-in-69549957.html.

History Hills Road Sixth Form College was established on 15 September 1974 on the site of the former Cambridgeshire High School for Boys, when education in Cambridgeshire was reorganised on a comprehensive basis, and grammar schools and secondary moderns were replaced by a system of (mainly) 11-16 comprehensive schools and sixth form colleges. Since then, the college has expanded from its original single building, with the addition of the Sports and Tennis Centre in 1995; the Colin Greenhalgh building, which houses most arts subjects such as English, Modern Languages and History; The Rob Wilkinson building housing the Physics, Chemistry, and PE departments was developed in 2004; in 2005 the Margaret Ingram Guidance Centre provided specialist tutorial accommodation. Although the College previously had ambitious plans for a major redesign between 2010 and 2013, the economic crisis reduced the scope of the plans: in 2010 the College administrative areas were redesigned, more classrooms added in the Physical Sciences, Psychology and Art departments, the staffroom enlarged and relocated, the library partially refurbished, an extra resource area built to compensate for the space used to build new classrooms and the student social area rebuilt. In the early 1990s responsibility for further education was removed from local authorities (as part of reforms aimed at reducing the level of the council tax), and Hills Road like other colleges moved to direct funding from central Government. Admissions and destinations Hills Road is one of seven post-16 centres in the Cambridge Area 14-19 Partnership. The state-maintained secondary schools in the city and Village Colleges in the surrounding areas are the main feeder schools to the centre, although it attracts students from all over the county and further. Currently, about 85% of students come from the school's catchment area, and 80% of students are from state maintained schools. Hills Road is permanently over-subscribed. The college typically requires candidates to achieve a B/6 (although at least an A for science and maths courses) grade in a related GCSE to study an A-Level course, whereas the nearby Long Road Sixth Form College typically requires a C/4 grade for entry to AS courses. Priority for places is given to those who have attended a school in the catchment area. The college also attracts students from out of area establishments, although such applications are only considered after places have been offered to all qualifying applicants in the Cambridge area. The College runs a relative admissions program, meaning that the grades which got you in one year may not get you in the next, as all applicants are judged relative to all the others who apply. About 90% of Hills Road students go onto higher education following their time at the college, for 40% this is after a gap year. About 5% of students enter full-time employment. For five years prior to 2007, half of students went on to attend one of sixteen universities (Birmingham, Bristol, Cambridge, Durham, East Anglia, Leeds, Loughborough, Manchester, Oxford, Nottingham, Sheffield, Sussex, Southampton, UCL, Warwick and York).Life after Hills Road Hills Road Website. Retrieved on 2006-12-30. In 2006, fifty-two Hills Road students gained places at Oxbridge; this was a larger number than at any other state school and represents one in every sixteen students.Hackett, G., State Schools & Oxbridge table, page 8 of The Sunday Times, 2006-12-17 Hills Road was recently ranked third in a list of the schools with highest levels of Oxbridge entry, after Westminster School and Eton College. The Sunday Times reported that Hills Road sends approximately sixty-five students to the universities of Cambridge and Oxford every year. Results and reputation As of 2018, the College has consistently topped the A level league tables for state Sixth Form Colleges for the past 25 years, with an average pass rate of 99.5% over all subjects. In 2018, 72% of grades were awarded A*-B, and over 40% of all results achieved the top A*-A grades. Hills Road Sixth Form College was voted the Sixth Form College of the Year in 2013, by the Sunday Times. In January 2014 Hills Road was named the \\"creme de la creme\\" of state schools by Tatler Magazine, and included in Tatler's list of thirty elite state school in the United Kingdom.National measures also place the College in or around the top decile amongst all types of institution for added-value: students of all abilities achieve better results in GCE AS/A levels than expected from their starting points. The 2009 Alps Report places the College third in the sixth form college performance table and in the top 1% for all institutions.

It was and still is widely used for basic training of glider pilots.  Design and development  In 1965 Rudolf Kaiser continued development of the two-seat Ka 2 and Schleicher Ka 7 by introducing the ASK 13, using a mixture of materials including metal, wood and glassfibre. It has swept-forward single-spar wings, positioned lower than in the Ka 7, which allows for a large blown canopy providing a good all-round view for both pilots. The 6 degree forward sweep of the wing allows the rear pilot to be seated near the centres of gravity and lift. The glider therefore maintains the same trim whether flown single seated or dual seated. The D-type leading edge torsion box is of plywood and the whole wing is fabric-covered. There are metal Schempp-Hirth air brakes above and below the wing, and the wooden ailerons are fabric-covered. The fuselage is a welded steel tube structure with spruce stringers and fabric-covered overall, except for the nose, which is glassfibre. The tail unit is plywood-covered, except for the rear part of the rudder and elevators, which are fabric-covered, and there is a Flettner trim tab in the starboard elevator. Landing gear consists of a non-retractable sprung wheel, mounted aft of the centre of gravity. The original design featured a skid under the nose and tail, although on many K13s these have been replaced with wheels to make handling on hard surfaces easier. It first flew in prototype form in July 1966 and by January 1978 a total of approximately 700 ASK 13s had been built by Schleicher. They are superb training gliders because they stall and spin well but these manoeuvres are easy to recover from. Their construction also gives them great strength and yet they are easily repairable.

It obviously seemed like an ideal name for a wheat farm when Reuban Uther was granted in 1812 but Uther only persisted with his dream for six years before selling the estate. The purchaser was Thomas Rose who renamed it Mount Gilead. Rose lived and farmed the estate from 1818 until his death in 1837. The estate was inherited by his son Henry Rose, until the foreclosure by the mortgagees in 1862. In 1941, the land was bought by the Macarthur-Onslow family, owners of nearby Camden Park Estate, who still own it today.

Caudill (May 3, 1922 - November 29, 1990) was an American author, historian, lawyer, legislator, and environmentalist from Letcher County, in the coalfields of southeastern Kentucky. Biography Caudill served in World War II as a private in the U.S. Army and was elected three times as to the Kentucky State House of Representatives. He taught in the History Department at the University of Kentucky from 1976 to 1984. A common theme explored in many of Caudill's writings is the historic underdevelopment of the Appalachian region (particularly his own home area of southeastern Kentucky). In several of his books (most prominently Night Comes to the Cumberlands, 1962) and many of his published articles, he probes the historical poverty of the region, which he attributes in large part to the rapacious policies of the coal mining industries active in the region, as well as their backers: bankers of the northeastern United States. He notes that such interests most often had their headquarters not in Appalachia but in the Northeast or Midwest, and thus failed to properly reinvest their sizable profits in the Appalachian region. Following publication of Night Comes to the Cumberlands, President John F. Kennedy appointed a commission to investigate conditions in the region and subsequently more than $15 billion in aid was invested in the region over twenty-five years. In his later years he became an active opponent of the rapidly growing practice of strip mining as practiced by companies working in Appalachia, which he believed was causing irreparable harm to the land and its people. He published articles in many magazines in addition to speaking out about the subject. Caudill pointed out that strip mining could be done responsibly as in England, Germany, and Czechoslovakia where topsoil, subsoil, and rocks are removed separately and placed back in layers in their original order. Caudill became interested in the work of William Shockley, a scientist with controversial eugenicist stances at Stanford University in California. Caudill came to believe in Shockley's theory of \\"dysgenics,\\" the argument that unintelligent people weaken the genes of a \\"race\\" over time. He felt that \\"genetic decline\\" in Eastern Kentucky contributed to issues of poverty. \\"The slobs continue to multiply,\\" Caudill wrote in a 1975 letter to Time magazine. The editors of Time rejected Caudill's letter. He also produced several volumes of folklore and oral history, which he collected himself from residents of the area centering on Letcher County and Harlan County, Kentucky. One of those oral history interviews in 1941 of a man who would have been about 90 years old, was the basis for the 1995 movie, Pharaoh's Army, starring Chris Cooper, Patricia Clarkson, and Kris Kristofferson. Caudill killed himself with a gunshot to the head in 1990, faced with an advancing case of Parkinson's disease. He is buried in Battle Grove Cemetery, Cynthiana, Kentucky. Legacy The Harry M. Caudill Library located in Whitesburg, Kentucky, the main library of the Letcher County Public Library District, is named for Caudill. Quote \\"And we just can't afford to sit back and watch all that (land) be destroyed so a few people can get rich now. One of these days the dear old federal government is going to have to come in and spend billions of dollars just to repair the damage that's already been done.

Random number generators can be true hardware random-number generators (HRNGS), which generate random numbers as a function of current value of some physical environment attribute that is constantly changing in a manner that is practically impossible to model, or pseudo-random number generators (PRNGS), which generate numbers that look random, but are actually deterministic, and can be reproduced if the state of the PRNG is known. Various applications of randomness have led to the development of several different methods for generating random data, of which some have existed since ancient times, among whose ranks are well-known \\"classic\\" examples, including the rolling of dice, coin flipping, the shuffling of playing cards, the use of yarrow stalks (for divination) in the I Ching, as well as countless other techniques. Because of the mechanical nature of these techniques, generating large quantities of sufficiently random numbers (important in statistics) required much work and time. Thus, results would sometimes be collected and distributed as random number tables. Several computational methods for pseudo-random number generation exist. All fall short of the goal of true randomness, although they may meet, with varying success, some of the statistical tests for randomness intended to measure how unpredictable their results are (that is, to what degree their patterns are discernible). This generally makes them unusable for applications such as cryptography. However, carefully designed cryptographically secure pseudo- random number generators (CSPRNGS) also exist, with special features specifically designed for use in cryptography.  Practical applications and uses  Random number generators have applications in gambling, statistical sampling, computer simulation, cryptography, completely randomized design, and other areas where producing an unpredictable result is desirable. Generally, in applications having unpredictability as the paramount feature, such as in security applications, hardware generators are generally preferred over pseudo-random algorithms, where feasible. Random number generators are very useful in developing Monte Carlo-method simulations, as debugging is facilitated by the ability to run the same sequence of random numbers again by starting from the same random seed. They are also used in cryptography ‚Äì so long as the seed is secret. Sender and receiver can generate the same set of numbers automatically to use as keys. The generation of pseudo-random numbers is an important and common task in computer programming. While cryptography and certain numerical algorithms require a very high degree of apparent randomness, many other operations only need a modest amount of unpredictability. Some simple examples might be presenting a user with a \\"random quote of the day\\", or determining which way a computer-controlled adversary might move in a computer game. Weaker forms of randomness are used in hash algorithms and in creating amortized searching and sorting algorithms. Some applications which appear at first sight to be suitable for randomization are in fact not quite so simple. For instance, a system that \\"randomly\\" selects music tracks for a background music system must only appear random, and may even have ways to control the selection of music: a true random system would have no restriction on the same item appearing two or three times in succession.  \\"True\\" vs. pseudo-random numbers  There are two principal methods used to generate random numbers. The first method measures some physical phenomenon that is expected to be random and then compensates for possible biases in the measurement process. Example sources include measuring atmospheric noise, thermal noise, and other external electromagnetic and quantum phenomena. For example, cosmic background radiation or radioactive decay as measured over short timescales represent sources of natural entropy. The speed at which entropy can be harvested from natural sources is dependent on the underlying physical phenomena being measured. Thus, sources of naturally occurring \\"true\\" entropy are said to be blocking they are rate- limited until enough entropy is harvested to meet the demand. On some Unix- like systems, including most Linux distributions, the pseudo device file will block until sufficient entropy is harvested from the environment. Due to this blocking behavior, large bulk reads from , such as filling a hard disk drive with random bits, can often be slow on systems that use this type of entropy source. The second method uses computational algorithms that can produce long sequences of apparently random results, which are in fact completely determined by a shorter initial value, known as a seed value or key. As a result, the entire seemingly random sequence can be reproduced if the seed value is known. This type of random number generator is often called a pseudorandom number generator. This type of generator typically does not rely on sources of naturally occurring entropy, though it may be periodically seeded by natural sources. This generator type is non-blocking, so they are not rate-limited by an external event, making large bulk reads a possibility. Some systems take a hybrid approach, providing randomness harvested from natural sources when available, and falling back to periodically re-seeded software-based cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generators (CSPRNGs). The fallback occurs when the desired read rate of randomness exceeds the ability of the natural harvesting approach to keep up with the demand. This approach avoids the rate-limited blocking behavior of random number generators based on slower and purely environmental methods. While a pseudorandom number generator based solely on deterministic logic can never be regarded as a \\"true\\" random number source in the purest sense of the word, in practice they are generally sufficient even for demanding security-critical applications. Indeed, carefully designed and implemented pseudo-random number generators can be certified for security-critical cryptographic purposes, as is the case with the yarrow algorithm and fortuna. The former is the basis of the source of entropy on FreeBSD, AIX, OS X, NetBSD, and others. OpenBSD uses a pseudo-random number algorithm known as arc4random. In October 2019, it was noted that the introduction of quantum random number generators (QRNGs) to machine learning models including neural networks and convolutional neural networks for random initial weight distribution and random forests for splitting processes had a profound effect on their ability when compared to the classical method of pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs).  Generation methods  Physical methods = The earliest methods for generating random numbers, such as dice, coin flipping and roulette wheels, are still used today, mainly in games and gambling as they tend to be too slow for most applications in statistics and cryptography. A physical random number generator can be based on an essentially random atomic or subatomic physical phenomenon whose unpredictability can be traced to the laws of quantum mechanics. Sources of entropy include radioactive decay, thermal noise, shot noise, avalanche noise in Zener diodes, clock drift, the timing of actual movements of a hard disk read-write head, and radio noise. However, physical phenomena and tools used to measure them generally feature asymmetries and systematic biases that make their outcomes not uniformly random. A randomness extractor, such as a cryptographic hash function, can be used to approach a uniform distribution of bits from a non-uniformly random source, though at a lower bit rate. The appearance of wideband photonic entropy sources, such as optical chaos and amplified spontaneous emission noise, greatly aid the development of the physical random number generator. Among them, optical chaos has a high potential to physically produce high-speed random numbers due to its high bandwidth and large amplitude. A prototype of a high speed, real-time physical random bit generator based on a chaotic laser was built in 2013. Various imaginative ways of collecting this entropic information have been devised. One technique is to run a hash function against a frame of a video stream from an unpredictable source. Lavarand used this technique with images of a number of lava lamps. HotBits measures radioactive decay with Geiger‚ÄìMuller tubes, while Random.org uses variations in the amplitude of atmospheric noise recorded with a normal radio. Demonstration of a simple random number generator based on where and when a button is clicked Another common entropy source is the behavior of human users of the system. While people are not considered good randomness generators upon request, they generate random behavior quite well in the context of playing mixed strategy games. Some security-related computer software requires the user to make a lengthy series of mouse movements or keyboard inputs to create sufficient entropy needed to generate random keys or to initialize pseudorandom number generators. = Computational methods = Most computer generated random numbers use PRNGs which are algorithms that can automatically create long runs of numbers with good random properties but eventually the sequence repeats (or the memory usage grows without bound). These random numbers are fine in many situations but are not as random as numbers generated from electromagnetic atmospheric noise used as a source of entropy. The series of values generated by such algorithms is generally determined by a fixed number called a seed. One of the most common PRNG is the linear congruential generator, which uses the recurrence :X_{n+1} = (a X_n + b)\\\\, \\\\textrm{mod}\\\\, m to generate numbers, where , and are large integers, and X_{n+1} is the next in as a series of pseudo-random numbers. The maximum number of numbers the formula can produce is one less than the modulus, -1. The recurrence relation can be extended to matrices to have much longer periods and better statistical properties . To avoid certain non-random properties of a single linear congruential generator, several such random number generators with slightly different values of the multiplier coefficient, , can be used in parallel, with a \\"master\\" random number generator that selects from among the several different generators. A simple pen-and-paper method for generating random numbers is the so-called middle square method suggested by John von Neumann. While simple to implement, its output is of poor quality. It has a very short period and severe weaknesses, such as the output sequence almost always converging to zero. A recent innovation is to combine the middle square with a Weyl sequence. This method produces high quality output through a long period. See Middle Square Weyl Sequence PRNG. Most computer programming languages include functions or library routines that provide random number generators. They are often designed to provide a random byte or word, or a floating point number uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. The quality i.e. randomness of such library functions varies widely from completely predictable output, to cryptographically secure. The default random number generator in many languages, including Python, Ruby, R, IDL and PHP is based on the Mersenne Twister algorithm and is not sufficient for cryptography purposes, as is explicitly stated in the language documentation. Such library functions often have poor statistical properties and some will repeat patterns after only tens of thousands of trials. They are often initialized using a computer's real time clock as the seed, since such a clock generally measures in milliseconds, far beyond the person's precision. These functions may provide enough randomness for certain tasks (for example video games) but are unsuitable where high-quality randomness is required, such as in cryptography applications, statistics or numerical analysis. Much higher quality random number sources are available on most operating systems; for example /dev/random on various BSD flavors, Linux, Mac OS X, IRIX, and Solaris, or CryptGenRandom for Microsoft Windows. Most programming languages, including those mentioned above, provide a means to access these higher quality sources. = Generation from a probability distribution = There are a couple of methods to generate a random number based on a probability density function. These methods involve transforming a uniform random number in some way. Because of this, these methods work equally well in generating both pseudo- random and true random numbers. One method, called the inversion method, involves integrating up to an area greater than or equal to the random number (which should be generated between 0 and 1 for proper distributions). A second method, called the acceptance-rejection method, involves choosing an x and y value and testing whether the function of x is greater than the y value. If it is, the x value is accepted. Otherwise, the x value is rejected and the algorithm tries again. = By humans = Random number generation may also be performed by humans, in the form of collecting various inputs from end users and using them as a randomization source. However, most studies find that human subjects have some degree of non-randomness when attempting to produce a random sequence of e.g. digits or letters. They may alternate too much between choices when compared to a good random generator; thus, this approach is not widely used.  Post-processing and statistical checks  Even given a source of plausible random numbers (perhaps from a quantum mechanically based hardware generator), obtaining numbers which are completely unbiased takes care. In addition, behavior of these generators often changes with temperature, power supply voltage, the age of the device, or other outside interference. And a software bug in a pseudo-random number routine, or a hardware bug in the hardware it runs on, may be similarly difficult to detect. Generated random numbers are sometimes subjected to statistical tests before use to ensure that the underlying source is still working, and then post- processed to improve their statistical properties. An example would be the TRNG9803 hardware random number generator, which uses an entropy measurement as a hardware test, and then post-processes the random sequence with a shift register stream cipher. It is generally hard to use statistical tests to validate the generated random numbers. Wang and Nicol proposed a distance- based statistical testing technique that is used to identify the weaknesses of several random generators. Li and Wang proposed a method of testing random numbers based on laser chaotic entropy sources using Brownian motion properties.  Other considerations  Random numbers uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 can be used to generate random numbers of any desired distribution by passing them through the inverse cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the desired distribution (see Inverse transform sampling). Inverse CDFs are also called quantile functions. To generate a pair of statistically independent standard normally distributed random numbers (x, y), one may first generate the polar coordinates (r, Œ∏), where r2~œá22 and Œ∏~UNIFORM(0,2œÄ) (see Box‚ÄìMuller transform). Some 0 to 1 RNGs include 0 but exclude 1, while others include or exclude both. The outputs of multiple independent RNGs can be combined (for example, using a bit-wise XOR operation) to provide a combined RNG at least as good as the best RNG used. This is referred to as software whitening. Computational and hardware random number generators are sometimes combined to reflect the benefits of both kinds. Computational random number generators can typically generate pseudo-random numbers much faster than physical generators, while physical generators can generate \\"true randomness.\\"  Low-discrepancy sequences as an alternative  Some computations making use of a random number generator can be summarized as the computation of a total or average value, such as the computation of integrals by the Monte Carlo method. For such problems, it may be possible to find a more accurate solution by the use of so-called low-discrepancy sequences, also called quasirandom numbers. Such sequences have a definite pattern that fills in gaps evenly, qualitatively speaking; a truly random sequence may, and usually does, leave larger gaps.

They supply a variety of ways of fetching the data, including libraries for several programming languages. * The Group at the Taiyuan University of technology generates random numbers sourced from chaotic laser. Samples of random number are available at their Physical Random Number Generator Service.  Backdoors  Since much cryptography depends on a cryptographically secure random number generator for key and cryptographic nonce generation, if a random number generator can be made predictable, it can be used as backdoor by an attacker to break the encryption. The NSA is reported to have inserted a backdoor into the NIST certified cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator Dual EC DRBG. If for example an SSL connection is created using this random number generator, then according to Matthew Green it would allow NSA to determine the state of the random number generator, and thereby eventually be able to read all data sent over the SSL connection. Even though it was apparent that Dual_EC_DRBG was a very poor and possibly backdoored pseudorandom number generator long before the NSA backdoor was confirmed in 2013, it had seen significant usage in practice until 2013, for example by the prominent security company RSA Security. There have subsequently been accusations that RSA Security knowingly inserted a NSA backdoor into its products, possibly as part of the Bullrun program. RSA has denied knowingly inserting a backdoor into its products. It has also been theorized that hardware RNGs could be secretly modified to have less entropy than stated, which would make encryption using the hardware RNG susceptible to attack. One such method which has been published works by modifying the dopant mask of the chip, which would be undetectable to optical reverse-engineering. For example, for random number generation in Linux, it is seen as unacceptable to use Intel's RDRAND hardware RNG without mixing in the RDRAND output with other sources of entropy to counteract any backdoors in the hardware RNG, especially after the revelation of the NSA Bullrun program. In 2010, a U.S. lottery draw was rigged by the information security director of the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL), who surreptitiously installed backdoor malware on the MUSL's secure RNG computer during routine maintenance. During the hacks the man won a total amount of $16,500,000 by predicting the numbers correctly a few times in year. Address space layout randomization (ASLR), a mitigation against rowhammer and related attacks on the physical hardware of memory chips has been found to be inadequate as of early 2017 by VUSec. The random number algorithm, if based on a shift register implemented in hardware, is predictable at sufficiently large values of p and can be reverse engineered with enough processing power (Brute Force Hack). This also indirectly means that malware using this method can run on both GPUs and CPUs if coded to do so, even using GPU to break ASLR on the CPU itself.

This is in allusion to the conspicuous yelping calls which, when sitting, are given with the head fully thrown to the back, a peculiarity found among sea eagles only in this and the African species.) or Madagascar sea-eagle (to distinguish it from the Ichthyophaga fishing-eagles), is a large bird of prey in the family Accipitridae which also includes many other diurnal raptors such as kites, buzzards and harriers. It is endemic to the coastal strip in the northwest of Madagascar. It is about long and has a pale brown head, dark brown body and white tail. The Madagascan fish eagle has been suffering from a declining population and is threatened by habitat destruction and persecution, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being \\"critically endangered\\". Description The Madagascan fish eagle is a medium-sized sea eagle, long and with a wingspan of .Raptors of the World by Ferguson‚ÄìLees, Christies, Franklin, Mead & Burton. Houghton Mifflin (2001), The body and wings are dark brown, with a pale brown head and a white tail; the bill is blackish with a paler base, and the legs are pale grey. Males weigh , while the slightly larger females weigh . Its closest relative is the African fish eagle, Haliaeetus vocifer. Together, they form a distinct species pair lineage of sea-eagles, which separated soon after the divergence of the genus; they retain the ancestral dark beak, talon, and eye, but unlike other Haliaeetus species, they always have at least partially white tails, even while juvenile. As in other sea-eagle species pairs, one species (the Madagascan fish eagle in this case) has a tan head, while the other has a white one.  Distribution  This species is endemic to Madagascar, where it survives in low numbers along the northwest coast north of Morondava. The range of this eagle is within the Madagascar dry deciduous forests. The principal locus of population according to the United Nations Environmental Programme is in the Analova region; 20 to 25 breeding pairs were there as of the 1980s. A more recent survey by Garbutt and Hogan report a smaller concentration of at least three breeding pairs in the Anjajavy Forest along the Indian Ocean, where several streams discharge north of Anjajavy Village. Status Total population estimates from the United Nations and from Grambo Rebecca L. Grambo, \\"Eagles\\" (1.000.000.00bc) Published by Voyageur Press, Inc. place the world population of this species at about 40 breeding pairs; according to Grambo this bird may be one of the rarest birds on Earth. Other surveys between 1991 and 1995 recorded at least 222 adults from 105 sites, with an estimated 98 breeding pairs. The main threats to its breeding habitat are deforestation, soil erosion and the development of wetland areas for rice paddies. It is also in direct competition with humans for fish stocks. Because of its decline in numbers and the threats it faces, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the bird's conservation status as being \\"critically endangered\\".

Located in the Grijalva River valley of the Chiapas highlands, Chiapa de Corzo lies some 15 km (9.3 mi) to the east of the state capital, Tuxtla Guti√©rrez. Chiapa has been occupied since at least 1400 BCE, with a major archeological site which reached its height between 700 BCE and 200 CE. It is important because the earliest inscribed date, the earliest form of hieroglyphic writing and the earliest Mesoamerican tomb burial have all been found here. Chiapa is also the site of the first Spanish city founded in Chiapas in 1528. The \\"de Corzo\\" was added to honor Liberal politician Angel Albino Corzo. Demographics As of 2010, the municipality had a total population of 87,603. As of 2010, the city of Chiapa de Corzo had a population of 45,077. Other than the city of Chiapa de Corzo, the municipality had 404 localities, the largest of which (with 2010 populations in parentheses) were: Jard√≠nes del Grijalva (2,881), classified as urban, and Juli√°n Grajales (2,394), Salvador Urbina (1,653), Las Flechas (1,579), Galecio Narc√≠a (1,553), El Palmar (San Gabriel) (1,477), Juan del Grijalva (1,428), Ignacio Allende (1,396), Venustiano Carranza (1,301), Narciso Mendoza (1,193), Nicol√°s Bravo (1,184), Am√©rica Libre (1,073), and Nuevo Carmen Tonapac (1,010), classified as rural. Town and municipality View of the Santo Domingo Church The town/municipality is located about fifteen km from the state capital of Tuxtla Guti√©rrez and connected to the city of San Crist√≥bal de las Casas via Federal Highway 190 also known as the Panamerican Highway. The town is located along the Grijalva River and has one of the main docks along this waterway. The town is laid out in Spanish style, centered on a very large plaza which the municipality claims is larger than the Zocalo, or main plaza of Mexico City. (sec. This plaza has a number of important features. The largest and best known is the La Pila fountain. This was constructed in 1562 in Moorish style, made of brick in the form of a diamond. The structure is attributed to Dominican brother Rodrigo de Le√≥n. It measures fifty two meters in circumference and twelve meters in height. It has eight arches and a cylindrical tower which occasionally functioned as a watchtower. Another important feature is the La Pochota kapok tree. According to tradition, the Spanish town was founded around this tree. The last feature is a clock tower which was constructed in the 1950s. The town's main structures are centered on this plaza, including the municipal palace and the former home of Liberal governor Angel Albino Corzo, for whom the town is partially named. One side of the plaza is taken by the ‚Äúportales‚Äù a series of arches initially built in the 18th century, which contain a number of businesses. Unlike many towns, the main church does not face this plaza. It is set back from it about a block. The Santo Domingo church and former monastery is the largest structure in the town, set on a small hill overlooking the river.(sectorchiapas) It is locally known as the ‚ÄúIglesia Grande‚Äù or Big Church. The structure was built in the second half of the 16th century and attributed to Pedro de Barrientos and Juan Alonso. The church is one of the best preserved from the 16th century in Chiapas. It has three naves, a coffered ceiling and cupolas above the presbytery and intersection. It is based on the Moorish churches of the Seville region in Spain, but it also has Gothic, Renaissance and Neoclassical influences. Its main bell tower has the largest bells in the country. The main altar of the church is only about two decades old and made of cedar, designed in Puebla. The entire piece is supposed to be gilded but so far only a small area in the upper part has had this treatment. The gold used here is 24 carat from Italy and measures two meters by eighty centimeters. The work cost 150,000 pesos, which was collected through raffles and donations for the project. To finish the work, another half a million pesos is needed. Other images in the church include an image of the Virgin of Guadalupe, Saint Joseph, the Archangel Michael, Saint Dominic and Saint Sebastian. The church complex is partially maintained by the Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia (INAH). The Chiapa Pochota tree. To the side of the Big Church is the former Dominican monastery. This structure has been restored to house exhibition halls, including those associated with the Museo de la Laca (Lacquer Museum). The most important craft in the municipality is the working of wood, often with these pieces glazed in lacquer. One item is the masks used for traditional dances such as Parachicos. Another is the popular musical instrument the marimba. Lacquer is used on wooden items and other things such as gourds. It is decorative, often with intricate designs. This craft is locally called ‚Äúlaca.‚Äù Other important churches in the town include the Calvario and the San Sebastian. The Calvario Church is from the 17th century. It was remodeled in Gothic Revival architecture at the beginning of the 19th century. Its interior conserves a wooden relief which was part of the Santo Domingo Church. San Sebastian is a church in ruins located on the San Gregorio hill. It was constructed in the 17th century when the city was at its height. It had three naves separated by archways. However, only its apse and facade remain with elements of Moorish, Renaissance and Baroque elements. The municipality Chiapa de Corzo is the local governing authority for 83 other communities, all of which are considered rural for a total territory of 906.7km2. These communities include Juli√°n Grajales, Las Flechas, Salvador Urbina, El Palmar San Gabriel, Caleci√≥ Narcia, Ignacio Allende, Venustiano Carranza and Nicol√°s Bravo. ) Twenty three percent of the municipality's land is communally owned in ejidos with the rest either privately owned or parkland. The municipality borders the municipalities of Soyal√≥, Osumacinta, Tuxtla Guti√©rrez, Suchiapa, Villaflores, Zinacant√°n, Ixtapa, Acala and Villa Corzo. The municipality has 233.55 km of principal roadways, divided among rural roads managed by SCT, the Comisi√≥n Estatal de Campinos, the Secretar√≠a de Obras P√∫blicas, Desarrollo Rural, Defensa Nacional and the Comisi√≥n Nacional del Agua. Throughout the municipality, festivals, music and cuisine are similar. The Festival of the Se√±or de El Calvario is a social and religious event which occurs on 7 October. It honors an image of Christ with masses, popular dances, fireworks and amusement rides along with cultural and sporting events. The Fiesta Grande is celebrated from 15 to 23 January and it is the most important for the year. The marimba is the most often heard instrument at festivals and parties. The main dishes include stews with potatoes and squash seeds, pork with rice and tamales. Cochito is pork cooked in an adobo sauce. It is popular throughout the state but important in Chiapa de Corzo for the Comida Grande which is served during the Festival of San Sebastian in January. Another is a beef dish where the meat is dried then fried then served with a sauce made from squash seeds, green tomatoes and achiote. Typical sweets are also made with squash seeds. A typical cold drink is pozol. Historically, the dominant indigenous ethnicity has been the Zoques and there are still Zoque communities in the municipality. As of 2005, there were 2,899 people who spoke an indigenous language, out of a total of over 60,000. Most of the municipality's population is young with 64% under the age of thirty and the average age of twenty one. The rate of population growth is just over three percent, which is above the state average of 2.06%. The population of the municipality is expected to double within twenty three years. Over 48% of the population lives in the city proper and the rest live in the 276 rural communities. Population density is at 67 inhabitants per square kilometers, below the regional average of 75/km2 but above the state average of 52. The average woman has 2.89 children which is below the state average of 3.47. Over 76% of the population is Catholic with about 13percent belonging to a Protestant or other Christian group. Illiteracy as of 2000 was at just under twenty percent, down from just under twenty five percent in 1990. Of those over 15 years of age, just under 25% have not completed primary school, about 17% with primary completed and over 35% having education above the primary level. Maya clothing tianguis According to Consejo Nacional de Poblaci√≥n (CONAPO) the municipality has a high rate of socioeconomic marginalization, despite the fact that it is between the two least marginalized municipalities in the state, Tuxtla Guti√©rrez and San Crist√≥bal. As of 2005, there were 16,327 residences. Just over 84% of homes are owned by their residents, with an average occupancy of 4.62 people per home, which is about state average. Over 28% of homes have dirt floors and about 64% have cement. About 62% of homes have cinderblock walls, and roofs are either made of tile (about 40%) and or a slab of concrete (about 30%). About 95% of homes have electricity, over 70% have running water and over 77% have sewerage, all above state average. Over 35% of the municipality's working population is in agriculture. Of these, about a third do not receive any salary for their work. Principal crops include corn, peanuts, sorghum, cotton, bananas, mangos, melons, jocote (Spondias purpurea), chard, lettuce and onions. Livestock includes cattle, pigs and domestic fowl as well as beekeeping. Fishing is limited to species such as mojarra and catfish. Just over 20% of the population is dedicated to industry, construction and transportation. The main industry is the Nestl√© plant. There are also plants that manufacture plywood and bricks. There is also some handcraft workshops. Over 41% of the population is dedicated to commerce, services and tourism. One of the main tourist attractions for the municipality is the Sumidero Canyon, with the municipal docks on the Grijalva River mostly serving tour boats into the National Park up to the La Angostura Dam. Most commerce is small stores and commercial centers for local needs and some for tourism. Services include hotels, auto repair and professional services. There are three hotels with seventy nine rooms. The Fiesta Grande de Enero A Parachico dancer The Fiesta Grande de Enero (Great January Feast) takes place from 4 to 23 January every year in Chiapa de Corzo, to honor local patron saints Our Lord of Esquipulas, Anthony the Great and Saint Sebastian. The festival has been included in UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists on November 16, 2010, listed as \\"Parachicos in the traditional January feast of Chiapa de Corzo\\".ICH entry. Unesco.org (2009-12-11). Retrieved on 2011-06-03. Since then, the event has experienced a surge in interest, making the Dance of the Parachicos the highlight. However, this has not assured the survival of the event or of the Parachicos dancers. There are fewer dancers than in the past, and many of the younger generation are not interested in the time it takes to carve a traditional mask from wood then lacquer it. The Fiesta Grande de Enero is a celebration which joins a number of events which all happen in the month of January. Originally, these were the feast days of patron saints and other figures, including a Christ figure called the Our Lord of Esquipulas, Anthony the Great and Saint Sebastian. Since then, it has developed to include other events and overall it is meant to give thanks for what has been received over the past year. On 8 January, the Fiesta Grande is announced and the first of the dances, by dancers called ‚ÄúChuntas,‚Äù is performed. The feast day of the Our Lord of Esquipulas is on January 15, who is honored where he is kept at the Se√±or de Milagros Church. On 16 January the festival of Saint Sebastian is announced. 17 January is dedicated to San Antonio Abad with a parade of Parachicos. On 18 January, the Parachicos visit the graves of deceased patrons. On 19 January the festival of Saint Sebastian is announced. The 20th is dedicated to this saint as well, with activities starting early and foods such as pepita con tasajo to the public. On the 21 of January a naval battle takes place on the Grijalva River, which consists of a spectacle using thousands of fireworks. This tradition began in 1599, when Pedro de Barrientos, vicar of the Santo Domingo Church, encouraged the development of fireworks making. He came up with the naval battle idea as a diversion and over time it became a way to fascinate visitors. Today, the battle is a recreation of the Battle of Puerto Arturo which occurred on 21 January 1906, by a group of local firework makers. On 22 January, there is a parade with floats. This day is marked with confetti and mariachis along with various types of dancers. The last day, the 23rd is marked by a parade of dancers. Then there is a mass. During these last hours, the drums and flutes play a melancholy tune as the fireworks ends and the streets quiet. The Parachicos cry during their mass as the festival ends. The traditional food during this time is pork with rice and pepita con tasajo. Although the Parachicos are the best known and recognized of the dancers, there are actually three types. All refer back to a story that takes place in the colonial era. According to legend, Do√±a Mar√≠a de Angula was a rich Spanish woman who traveled in search of a cure for a mysterious paralytic illness suffered by her son, which no doctor could cure. When she arrived here, she was directed to a curandero, or local healer called a namandiyugu√°. After examining the boy, he instructed his mother to bathe him in the waters of a small lake called Cumbujuya, after which he was miraculously cured. To distract and amuse the boy, a local group disguised themselves as Spaniards with masks and began to dance showing ‚Äúpara el chico‚Äù which means ‚Äúfor the boy.‚Äù According to one version of the story, this is what cured the child. The tradition of these dancers began in 1711, leading the Spanish to call the event ‚Äúpara el chico‚Äù, which eventually evolved into Parachicos. The term is also used to refer to the best known of the dancers of the Fiesta Grande. The Parachicos dress in a mask, a helmet or wig made of ixtle, a Saltillo style sarape. The mask is carved of wood and decorated with lacquer to mimic a Spanish face. Originally the masks had beards, but over time they evolved and many have an almost childlike look. The ixtle head covering is supposed to mimic blonde hair. The dancers carry a type of maraca made of metal called chinchin to make noise along with the taping of their boot heels. These carry a guitar and/or whip (the latter used by encomenderos in the colonial period). The dancers use the whips to lightly tap children, youths, old men and even some women. These dancers appear a number of times during the days of the Fiesta Grande. These processions visit the various churches on their path, which are decorated with branches, on which are hung breads, sweets, fruits and plastic decorations. Accompanying the Parachicos or dancing on their own is another type of dancer called ‚Äúchuntas.‚Äù These are men dressed as women as the word chunta means maid or servant. These figures represent the ‚Äúservants‚Äù of Do√±a Mar√≠a. Most of the men dress in shirts and long skirts. The two types of dancers appear on several occasions during the days of the festival dancing and marching to pipes, drums and other instruments. The dance reenacts the search for relief from a pain and suffering, including hunger. The dancers distribute food and small gifts for this reason. The route is lined by spectators who hope to receive some of the gifts that the dancers distribute. The ‚Äúpatron‚Äù of the dances and processions has been the Nigenda family for about seventy years, whose house at 10 Alvaro Obregon Avenue becomes the meeting point for the dancers during the festival. At the back of the patio of this house, there is an altar which the portraits of two deceased members of the family Atilano Negenda and Arsenio Nigenda. The latter ceded the charge of the dance to the current patron, Guadalupe Rubicel Gomez Nigenda in 1999. The Parachicos dress in their costumes at the patron's house, then they pray as a group. First the musicians exit playing flutes, drums and whistles. At a signal, the hundreds of Parachicos begin dancing and shouting. At the end of the parade is the patron, Rubisel Nigenda, who is accompanying by a ‚ÄúChulita‚Äù a young woman who does not wear a mask, but rather an old fashioned traditional Chiapan dress, with a long skirt, embroidered shirt and roses. She represents the women of Chiapas. They are followed by people carrying flags representing various saints. In the middle of these is the flag of the city's patron saint and ‚Äúking‚Äù of the festival, Saint Sebastian. Environment Grijalva river running through the city. The municipality consists of rolling hills which alternate with flat areas, mostly along rivers and streams. Most of the territory is in the Central Valley region but in the northwest, it transitions into the Central Highlands. The main rivers include the Grijalva, also called the Grande de Chiapa and the Santo Domingo. Streams include El Chiquito, Majular, Nandabur√© and Nandalum√≠. The climate is hot and relatively humid with most rain falling from July to November. The annual average temperature in the city is 26C with an annual rainfall of 990mm. The natural vegetation of the area is lowland rainforest with pine-oak forests in the extreme north. However, much of these forests have been overexploited with the loss of wildlife. Wildlife includes river crocodiles, coral snakes, heloderma, iguanas, opossums and skunks. Part of the Sumidero Canyon National Park is in the municipality. The El Chorreadero is a state park located in the municipality centered on the waterfall of the same name. It has an area of 100 hectares with lowland rainforest and secondary vegetation. The Grijalva River extends twenty three km from the city to the Chicoas√©n Dam, formally known as the Ing. Manuel Moreno Torres, one of the largest in Latin America. Boats touring the canyon leave from the Cahuar√© Docks. History Skeleton from Mound 5 of Chiapa de Corzo site at the Regional Museum of Anthropology and History of Chiapas. The region has been inhabited at least since the Archaic period of Mesoamerican history.Lowe, p. 122-123. The immediate area of the municipality was settled around 1200 BCE by a group of people related to the Olmec culture, who are thought to have been speakers of an early Mixe‚ÄìZoquean language. However, the exact relationship between Chiapa de Corzo and the Olmec world has not been definitively established. By 900 or 800 BCE, the village, now archeological site, show a strong relationship with the Olmec center of La Venta, but it is unknown if Chiapa was ruled by La Venta or not. However, much the settlement shared many features with La Venta, including a ceremonial pond and pottery styles as well as using the same sources for materials such as obsidian and andesite. The Chiapa site is important because it shows a Mixe‚ÄìZoque‚ÄìOlmec culture which eventually split from the Olmec. The development of the ancient city has been divided into a number of phases. The earliest and most important are the Escalera or Chiapa III (700-500BCE) and Francesa or Chiapa IV (500BCE to 100CE) phase. Olmec influence is strongest in the Escalera phase when it became a planned town with formal plazas and monumental buildings. However, contacts with Mayan areas is evident as well. However, even during this phase, there are significant differences in architecture and pottery which suggest a distinct Zoque identity from the Mixe‚ÄìZoque/Olmec cultural base. The distinction grew in the Francesca period as monumental structures were enlarged and pottery was almost all locally made. There is also evidence of participation in long distance trade networks, and the first examples of hieroglyphic writing appear. The earliest Long Count inscription in Mesoamerica derives from this phase, with a date of 36 BCE appearing on Stela 2. At its height, was an independent city on major trade routes. It may have been a major influence for the later Maya civilization as the pyramids in Chiapa are very similar to the E group pyramids found in most of Mesoamerica. The following Horcones phase and Istmo phase to 400 CE show more elaborate tomb construction and craft specialization. By the end of these phases, however, craft activity diminishes and long distance ties contracted even though tombs remain elaborate. The final centuries are associated with the Jiquipilas phase around 400 CE. It is not known what brought down the civilization, but the city became gradually abandoned and appears to have become a pilgrimage site, perhaps by Zoque who had been conquered by the Chiapa people. Whether the Chiapa actually conquered the Zoque city or whether it had fallen before their arrival, the newcomers decided to occupy the adjacent floodplain of the Grijalva River, where the modern town is, and leave the old ruins untouched. By the early 16th century, this town had become a local power center called Napinaica. The Chiapa people were distinct from others in Chiapas in size, nudity, and fierceness which impressed the Spanish who noted it in their writings. These people were fiercely opposed to Spanish intrusion and were a major obstacle to the first efforts by the conquistadors to dominate. However, in 1528, Diego de Mazariegos succeeded in breaking this resistance by enlisting the help of neighboring peoples who were enemies of the Chiapa. The last Chiapa leader, named Sanguieme, tried to help his people escape the domination of the Spanish but, according to historian Jean de Vos, he was captured and burned alive in a hammock strung between two kapok trees, with a hundred of his followers hung from trees near the river. Panel from the original main altar of the Santo Domingo Church After the conquest, the town was refounded with the name of Villa Real de Chiapa by a large kapok tree called La Pochota as the first European city in Chiapas. However, the hot climate of the area did not entice many Spanish to stay. Most instead went to the northeast into the cooler mountains to found another city, today San Cristobal. The mountain city would be founded as Chiapa de los Espa√±oles, while Villa Real de Chiapa would become known Chiapa de los Indios, left to the indigenous and monks there to evangelize them. Despite this, the city would remain one of the most important for the first 200 years of colonization. While it was an encomienda at first, it became a dependency of the Spanish Crown in 1552, changing its name to Pueblo de la Real Corona de Chiapa de Indios. The developers of the area were Dominican friars, who followed the ideals of Bartolom√© de las Casas in neighboring San Cristobal. They worked to protect the indigenous against the abuses of the Spanish colonizers, allowing them to gain the trust of the local people and convert them to Christianity. They also taught the local indigenous crafts such as European pottery methods, fireworks making and rope making. The Dominicans also built many of the landmarks of the town such as the La Pila fountain. This protection and the very high percentage of indigenous population in the colonial period allowed for many indigenous names to survive to the present day. Along with surnames such as Grajales, Castellanos, Marino Hern√°ndez, there is Nandayapa, Tawa, Nuriul√∫, Nampul√° and Nangus√© among others. In 1849, the city was declared the seat of its district. The town was officially declared a city in 1851. ‚Äúde Corzo‚Äù was added to the name in 1881 in honor of Liberal politician Angel Albino Corzo. In 1863, there was a battle between the French and the Liberals, with the latter led by Salvador Urbina. Between 1970 and 1979, the construction of the Chicoas√©n Dam caused tremblers in the area. One of these toppled the large bell in the main church. The main highway that connects the city with San Crist√≥bal was built in 2000. During this same year, the first non PRI municipal president was elected, from the National Action Party. Archeology Date inscription from Stele 2 from the Chiapa de Corzo site While there is evidence of human occupation in the region from at least the Archaic period the main archeological site for the area is near the modern town of Chiapa de Corzo. This archeological site is located 2 kilometers away from Grijalva River. The origin of this ceremonial and administrative center goes back 3,500 years, being a strategic point in commercial routes between the Pacific and Gulf of Mexico coasts. It was one of the largest settlements in early Mesoamerica occupied from 1200 BCE to 600 CE. This site had been occupied from at least 1400 BCE until sometime in the late Classic period. The site reached its height between 700 BCE to 200 CE, when it was a large settlement along major trade routes.Lowe, pp. 122‚Äì123. The site is important for a number of reasons. First, while it was definitely inhabited by Mixe- Zoque speakers, it has strong ties to the Olmecs, but it is not known what exactly these ties were. Some theories state that the population was genetically related to the Olmecs, while others suppose that they were dominated by the Olmecs initially but then eventually broke away. There have been significant finds here such as the oldest Mesoamerican Long Count calendar with the date of 36 BCE on a monument, as well as a pottery shard with the oldest instance of writing system yet discovered.Justeson, p. 2. A recent discovery has been the oldest pre Hispanic tomb, dated to between 700 and 500 BCE. It was found in a previously excavated 20-meter-tall pyramid, but in the very center. The occupant is richly attired with more than twenty axes found as offerings, placed in the cardinal directions. The culture is considered to be Olmec although more exact dating needs to be done. The offerings show Olmec influence, such as depictions of wide eyes and lips, but other typical Olmec decorations such as earspools and breastplates are missing. In addition to the axes, there are also more than three thousand pieces made of jade, river pearls, obsidian and amber, from areas as far away as Guatemala and the Valley of Mexico, showing trade networks. The face was covered in a seashell with eye and mouth openings, the earliest example of a funeral mask. The burial shows that many elements of Mesoamerican burials are older than previously thought. The archeological site lies just outside the urban sprawl of modern Chiapa de Corzo, but the city is growing over it and many areas known to contains ruins underground are encroached upon by modern homes and businesses. The discovery of the ancient tomb has prompted the Mexican government to buy more lands and extend the site by 7,200 square meters to one and a half hectares. Part of the site has been open to tourism since late 2009. ReferencesBibliography *Justeson, John S., and Kaufman, Terrence (2001) Epi-Olmec Hieroglyphic Writing and Texts. *Lowe, G.

One of his daughters, who went to Krak√≥w after her marriage, is the reputed ancestress of the celebrated Rabbi Moses Isserles (◊®◊û◊¥◊ê). The Auerbach family gained Court Jew status and later nobility titles under the Habsburg Monarchy. The name, Auerbach means, \\"the stream that comes from the meadow. Auerbach is the name of several places in Southern German.  Viennese Branch  Another branch of the Auerbach family settled at Vienna. A near-relative, Meshullam Solomon Fischhof-Auerbach, achieved eminence in that city and married Miriam Lucerna, the daughter of a well-known rabbi and physician, Leo Lucerna (Judah L√∂b Ma‚Äòor-qat‚Äòon L.). {Miriam is known to have died on July 29, 1654 (Frankl, Inschriften, No. 202)}. In his old age, it was Meshullam's misfortune to be driven from Vienna and exiled (1670) with his coreligionists. Before his death (1677), he had the satisfaction of seeing his sons occupy honorable positions. Nearly twenty years before, his son, Menahem Mendel Auerbach, had been called as rabbi to Reussnitz, Moravia, after having officiated as assessor to the rabbinate at Krak√≥w. The pupil of Yom-Tov Lipmann Heller, Joel Sarkes, and Joshua ben Joseph at the Talmud school in Krak√≥w, Menahem Mendel achieved an international reputation for Talmudic authority.  Simon Auerbach  The best known among Mendel's brothers is Simon Auerbach, who at the age of twenty- three wrote a penitential poem on the occasion of an epidemic that broke out among children in Vienna, in 1634. This poem passed through several editions, under the title Mish'on (sic) la-Yeladim (Support to Children), Frankfort-on- the-Main, 1711. The author died March 11, 1638, at Eibensch√ºtz (:de:Ivanƒçice). The poem was printed by the grandson of the author, Meshullam Solomon Fischhof, who added a commentary, Rab Shalom (Much Peace). He also published several prayers and hymns of Israel Nagara, with additions of his own (Frankfort-on-the-Main, 1712).  Hayyim Auerbach  Hayyim Auerbach, a second brother of Menahem Mendel, settled at Krak√≥w but later returned to Vienna as assessor of the rabbinate. He died there on 7 October 1665. A third brother, Benjamin Wolf Auerbach, settled at Nikolsburg and was held in high esteem as elder of the community, even officiating temporarily as chairman of the college of the rabbinate. His testament, printed together with the work Meqor Chokmah (Source of Wisdom), which contains an abundance of worldly wisdom and pious reflection, was published by his son, Meshullam Solomon, assessor of the rabbinate at Nikolsburg, who published an ethical work at the same time. Menahem Mendel's successor as rabbi of Krotoszyn was his grandson, who bore the same name, the son of Moses Auerbach (died May 9, 1739). Menahem Mendel ben Moses Auerbach served as rabbi of the congregation in Krotoszyn from 1732 to 1755,Lewin, Lewis; Gotthard, Deutsch (1905). \\"Posen\\", section: \\"Krotoschin\\".

A son of Simon Wolf, mentioned above, was David Tebele, surnamed \\"HaKadosh\\" (the Holy), who died as chief rabbi of Prague. His name was commemorated by his son, Samuel Auerbach, the author of Chesed Shmuel (Samuel's Charity), published in Amsterdam.  Phineas Auerbach  A member of the same family was Phineas Auerbach, president of the Jewish court at Krak√≥w (1695), and author of Halakah Berurah (Lucid Law), a commentary on Orach Chayim.  Hirsch Auerbach  Hirsch Auerbach belongs to another branch of the family. He was first assessor of the rabbinate at Brody, fleeing thence to Germany with a part of the community to escape exorbitant taxation and the machinations of informers. After wandering from one place to another he settled at Worms, to which he had been called in 1733 to Rabbi L√∂b Sinzheim's college, and was appointed rabbi in the same community in 1763. He died at Worms May 3, 1778, in the eighty-eighth year of his life, his pious wife Dobresch (daughter of the president Isaac at Brody) dying a few weeks before him. His son, born at Brody, Abiezri Selig Auerbach, was at first rabbi at Edenkoben, then at Buxweiler, where he died in 1767; his wife was the daughter of Isaac Sinzheim, rabbi at Trier and Niederehnheim.  Meir Auerbach  Yet another member of the family was Meir Auerbach (1815), president of the Jewish court at Ko≈Ço and author of \\"Imrei Bina\\" (Words of Wisdom).

This category was created to differentiate between British nationals with strong ties to the United Kingdom and those connected only with an overseas territory. Individuals with this nationality are British nationals and Commonwealth citizens, but not British citizens. This status does not give the holder right of abode in the United Kingdom but since 2002, almost all BOTCs simultaneously hold British citizenship, except for those connected only with the territory of Akrotiri and Dhekelia. Nationals of this class who are not also full citizens are subject to immigration controls when entering the UK. About 63,000 BOTCs hold active British passports with this status and enjoy consular protection when travelling abroad.  Background  All natural-born subjects of the Crown previously held the unrestricted right of free movement in any part of the British Empire., at para. 26. As different areas of the empire gained legislative power from London, these territories gradually enacted their own laws governing entry and residence rights. At the same time, a common imperial nationality was maintained (British subject status) so that those \\"belonging\\" to one territory would not be considered aliens in another., at para. 27. Although colonies that had not become independent Dominions remained under British sovereignty, they also had an accepted right to determine local immigration policy., at para. 29. The British Nationality Act 1948 categorised subjects from the United Kingdom and its remaining overseas territories as Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies (CUKCs)., at para. 32. All CUKCs initially held the right to enter and live in the UK,. although non-white immigration was systemically discouraged.. Immigration from the colonies and other Commonwealth countries was gradually restricted by Parliament from 1962 to 1971 amid decolonisation, when British subjects originating from outside of the British Islands first had immigration controls imposed on them when entering the UK.. Conversely, CUKCs did not have automatic right of abode in the colonies., at para. 35. After passage of the British Nationality Act 1981, CUKCs were reclassified into different nationality groups based on their ancestry and birthplace: CUKCs with right of abode in the United Kingdom or were closely connected with the UK, Channel Islands, or Isle of Man became British citizens while those connected with a remaining colony became British Dependent Territories citizens (BDTCs).. Right of abode in the territories is dependent on possession of belonger status., at para. 44. = Debate over full citizenship rights = At the time of nationality reclassification in 1983, the largest group of BDTCs (2.5 million people) was associated with Hong Kong.. The deprivation of full passports and nationality rights for colonial residents was criticized for effectively codifying ethnicity as the deciding factor in determining what rights British subjects were entitled to, an impression confirmed by exceptions granted to the majority white residents of Gibraltar and ‚Äì after the Falklands War ‚Äì the Falkland Islands..Lord Wyatt of Weeford, , col. 863. The British government was particularly unwilling to grant full citizenship and immigration rights to Hongkongers, fearing a mass migration to the UK after the transfer of sovereignty to China in 1997.Jim Marshall, , col. 495. In the remaining dependent territories, the majority of white residents maintained access to full citizenship while this was denied to non-white belongers. Territorial residents resented this treatment, because although Britain bore ultimate responsibility for their homes as the sovereign power, it did not treat them more favourably than travellers from foreign countries.Richard Spring, , col. 487.Michael Trend, , col. 523.Lord Waddington, , col. 904. = Restoration of citizenship = Almost five years after Hong Kong was transferred to China, Parliament restored access to full British citizenship and right of abode in the United Kingdom to virtually all British Dependent Territories citizens.Richard Spring, , col. 483. The sole exception to this was for those living in Akrotiri and Dhekelia, which were excluded due to their status as military bases as specified in the treaty establishing Cyprus.Ben Bradshaw, , col. 479. Any person who was a BDTC before 21 May 2002. automatically became a British citizen on that date,, s. 3. and children born after that date to BDTCs also automatically acquire full citizenship., s. 5. Additionally, the Act renamed the status British Overseas Territories citizenship, mirroring the name change for the territories themselves as well., s. 2.  Acquisition and loss  British Overseas Territories citizens may originate from any of the 14 territories (shown in red). There are four ways to acquire British Overseas Territories citizenship: by birth, adoption, descent, or naturalisation. Individuals born in a territory automatically receive BOTC status if at least one parent is a BOTC or has belonger status. Children born to British citizen parents who are not settled in an overseas territory are not BOTCs at birth. Parents do not necessarily need to be connected with the same overseas territory to pass on BOTC status. Alternatively, a child born in an overseas territory may be registered as a BOTC if either parent becomes a BOTC or settles in any overseas territory subsequent to birth. A child who lives in the same territory until age 10 and is not absent for more than 90 days in each year is also entitled to registration as a BOTC. Furthermore, an adopted child automatically become a BOTC on the effective day of adoption if either parent is a BOTC or has belonger status. In all cases that an individual is a British Overseas Territories citizen at birth or adoption within the territories, that person is a BOTC otherwise than by descent. Individuals born outside of the territories are BOTCs by descent if either parent is a BOTC otherwise than by descent. Unmarried fathers cannot automatically pass on BOTC status, and it would be necessary for them to register children as BOTCs. If a parent is a BOTC by descent, additional requirements apply to register children as BOTCs. Parents serving in Crown service who have children abroad are exempted from these circumstances, and their children would be BOTCs otherwise than by descent, as if they had been born on their home territory. Foreigners and non- BOTC British nationals may naturalise as British Overseas Territories citizens after residing in a territory for more than five years and possessing belonger status or permanent residency for more than one year. The residency requirement is reduced to three years if an applicant is married to a BOTC. All applicants for naturalisation and registration are normally considered by the governor of the relevant territory, but the Home Secretary retains discretionary authority to grant BOTC status. Since 2004, BOTC applicants aged 18 or older are required to take an oath of allegiance to the Sovereign and loyalty pledge to the relevant territory during their citizenship ceremonies. British Overseas Territories citizenship can be relinquished by a declaration made to the governor of the connected territory, provided that a person already possesses or intends to acquire another nationality. BOTC status can be deprived if it was fraudulently acquired or if an individual is solely connected with a territory that becomes independent and that person gains the new country's citizenship. The last territory to have done so is Saint Kitts and Nevis in 1983. BDTCs connected with Hong Kong also had their status removed at the transfer of sovereignty in 1997, but were able to register for British National (Overseas) status before the handover.  Rights and privileges  British Overseas Territories citizens are exempted from obtaining a visa or entry certificate when visiting the United Kingdom for less than six months. They are eligible to apply for two-year working holiday visas and do not face annual quotas or sponsorship requirements. When travelling in other countries, they may seek British consular protection. BOTCs are not considered foreign nationals when residing in the UK and are entitled to certain rights as Commonwealth citizens. These include exemption from registration with local police, voting eligibility in UK elections,. and the ability to enlist in the British Armed Forces. British Overseas Territories citizens are also eligible to serve in non-reserved Civil Service posts, be granted British honours, receive peerages, and sit in the House of Lords. If given indefinite leave to remain (ILR), they are eligible to stand for election to the House of Commons and local government. All British Overseas Territories citizens other than those solely connected with Akrotiri and Dhekelia became British citizens on 21 May 2002, and children born on qualified overseas territories to British citizens since that date are both BOTCs and British citizens otherwise than by descent. Prior to 2002, only BOTCs from Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands were given unrestricted access to citizenship. BOTCs naturalised after that date may also become British citizens by registration at the discretion of the Home Secretary. Becoming a British citizen has no effect on BOTC status; BOTCs may also simultaneously be British citizens.  Restrictions  British Overseas Territories = Although British Overseas Territories citizenship is granted to individuals who are closely connected to particular territories, each territory maintains separate immigration policies and different requirements for conferring belonger status. BOTC status by itself does not grant its holders right of abode or the right to work in any of the territories, at para. 42. and confers no entitlements other than the right to apply for a BOTC passport. Consequently, there are circumstances in which BOTCs do not have right of abode in the territory that they derive their citizenship from. BOTCs who are part of this group and have no other nationality are de facto stateless because they are deprived of the right to enter the country that claims them as nationals., at para. 17. Additionally, both BOTCs and full British citizens who are not belongers of a given territory may not vote or stand for public office in that jurisdiction.. = United Kingdom = British Overseas Territories citizens are subject to immigration controls and have neither the right of abode or the right to work in the United Kingdom. BOTCs other than Gibraltarians are also required to pay a \\"health surcharge\\" to access National Health Service benefits when residing in the UK for longer than six months and do not qualify for most welfare programmes.. However, since 2002, almost all BOTCs are also British citizens and have UK right of abode., at para. 43. When exercising that right and entering the UK for a period of more than six months, they must travel with British citizen passports or other valid passports endorsed with a certificate of entitlement for right of abode. = European Union = Before the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union on 31 January 2020, full British citizens were European Union citizens.. Most British Overseas Territories citizens were not EU citizens and did not enjoy freedom of movement in other EU countries. They were, Annex II. and continue to be, exempted from obtaining visas when visiting the Schengen Area. Gibraltar was the sole exception to this; BOTCs connected to that territory were also EU citizens and did have freedom of movement within the EU.

He is regarded as one of the greatest fielders in the history of Test cricket. Cricket career Colin Bland was educated at Milton High School in Bulawayo. He made his first-class debut for Rhodesia as a schoolboy against Peter May's English team in 1956-57 and went on to represent them 55 times from 1956 to 1968.. He later played for the South African provincial sides Eastern Province and Orange Free State. A tall and elegant right-handed batsman, Bland broke into the South African Test team in 1961, and was a regular until 1966‚Äì67. As South Africa in the apartheid era played Test cricket only against England, Australia and New Zealand, his career was restricted to just 21 Tests, in which he scored 1,669 runs, including three centuries. His highest Test score came in the Second Test against England at Johannesburg in 1964‚Äì65; South Africa followed on 214 behind, and was 109 for 4 in the second innings when Bland came in and hit 144 not out in just over four hours to save the match.Wisden 1966, p. 807. Bland's chief fame, though, rested on his fielding. The general consensus is that he was the finest cover fieldsman of his time, and rated by some as the finest ever, he was able to the turn the course of whole matches. His spectacular run out of Ken Barrington in the Lord's Test of 1965, followed by a similar dismissal of Jim Parks, may have prevented England from establishing a match- winning first innings lead, the match eventually being drawn. Brian Johnston recalled of the 1965 tour, \\"For the first time I heard people saying that they must go to a match especially to watch a fielder.\\"Brian Johnston, A Delicious Slice of Johnners, Virgin, 2001, p.147. Bland was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1966; he is one of only two players so honoured (the other is Stuart Surridge) to be depicted in the accompanying portrait fielding, rather than batting, bowling or keeping. When Wisden asked Peter van der Merwe in 1999 to name the five outstanding cricketers of the twentieth century, he included Colin Bland, saying, \\"He revolutionised the attitude to fielding, and set a standard not yet equalled.\\"Matthew Engel, \\"Five Cricketers of the Century: How They Were Chosen\\", Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 2000, p.19. Bland retired from Test cricket after injury forced him out of the side after the first Test in 1966‚Äì67. He continued to play first-class cricket in South Africa until the 1973‚Äì74 season. Death On 14 April 2018, Bland died at his home in London after a prolonged battle with colon cancer.

It is a plant of the large genus Grevillea in the diverse family Proteaceae. Native to Queensland, it has been a popular garden plant for many years though has been superseded somewhat horticulturally by smaller and more floriferous hybrids. A white-flowered form G. banksii fo. albiflora is known as white silky oak. Taxonomy Grevillea banksii was first described by the botanist Robert Brown, who gave it its epithet in honour of Sir Joseph Banks. Description It is a tall, slender or spreading shrub, or small tree up to high. Its leaves are pinnate with 3-11 deeply divided, linear to lanceolate segments long and 1 cm wide, with curled-back margins. Flowers are bright red or creamy-white, in clusters up to long. It flowers for most of the year, but mainly in winter and spring. Distribution and habitat Grevillea banksii is found on the Queensland coast from Ipswich to Byfield National Park. Here it grows on headlands, ridges and forest. The species has also been introduced elsewhere in the world. It has naturalized in the drier parts of southern portion of the island of Hawai'i and across large areas in eastern Madagascar. Cultivation seed pods of Grevillea banksii Various forms of Grevillea banksii have been in cultivation for many decades, however it is less seen now than previously as it has been replaced by smaller, more compact, hybrids such as G. 'Robyn Gordon' and G.' Superb'. These newer plants are more compact and have longer flowering periods and are more in demand in the era of the shrinking garden. Grevillea 'Ruby red' is a prostrate red flowering form of uncertain origin which is in cultivation, often grafted onto Grevillea robusta. However, it has left a rich horticultural legacy, being one of the parents of G. 'Robyn Gordon', which has been one of the most commercially successful garden plants in Australian horticultural history. It is also parent of other garden plants Grevillea 'Honey Gem', G. 'Superb', G. 'Misty Pink', G. 'Pink Surprise', and possibly G. 'Moonlight'.

The class introduced new features to destroyer design, placing a greater emphasis on seakeeping and endurance and less on a high maximum speed in good weather. All the ships were named after British and Irish rivers, and as such were the first Royal Navy destroyer class to be named systematically. Genesis The concept for the River class began in December 1900, with a request from John de Robeck, then the senior destroyer officer in the Mediterranean Fleet, for a new class of destroyer with a longer range than the existing \\"30-knotter\\" and \\"27-knotter\\" types. Robeck's specification called for a range of at a sustained speed of ; the \\"30-knotter\\" could only make at its cruising speed of .Friedman, p. 86 Robeck also called for various modifications to destroyer design to help make ships more seaworthy, in particular keeping up their speed in adverse weather conditions. The most noticeable change would be to introduce a raised forecastle rather than an arched turtleback for the hull forward of the bridge, and that the bridge should be placed further aft to keep it clear of spray from waves breaking over the bow. Furthermore, he felt that destroyers should run their speed trials with a more realistic load of fuel and supplies. The \\"30-knotter\\" type might have a nominal speed of 30 knots, but even in very good weather this was never achieved in service.Friedman, p. 87 Other officers serving on Royal Navy destroyers made similar observations about their ships. Robeck's commanding officer, Admiral \\"Jackie\\" Fisher, drew a comparison with the German , which had impressed Royal Navy officers who had seen it.Friedman, p. 88 In July 1901 the Director of Naval Construction worked on sketch designs for future destroyers, which included many of the features Robeck and his colleagues advocated, as well as a heavier and more reliable kind of engine. The trials speed was initially be , though further requirements for increased strength reduced the speed to . While this speed seemed like a significant reduction, it would be measured with a realistic 95 tons of coal loaded on board, and the better seakeeping properties meant that the new ships would perform better than a \\"30-knotter\\" in any seas except for a flat calm.Friedman, pp. 88-89 Design View at stern and the three propeller shafts of HMS Eden, 1904 laying in the dry dock As with other early British destroyer classes, the Admiralty invited specialist private firms to submit their own designs for destroyers which would meet the specification. The idea was to use the builders' knowledge of building small, fast, ships to help cram powerful machinery into a small hull. For this reason, details of the hull and internal arrangements differed between ships in the class. Nevertheless, the River class can clearly be distinguished from previous destroyers because of its raised forecastle. Previous British designs that had a low \\"turtle-back\\" forecastle, which, although intended to clear the bows, caused them to dig in to the sea, resulting in a very wet conning position. The bridge was also further back than in previous destroyer models. All ships were coal fired and all but three had triple expansion steam engines; Eden, Stour and Test were powered by steam turbines. Eden was given turbines to test their viability for future destroyer classes, with two propellers on each of her three shafts, to transmit the power at the high revolutions of the direct drive turbines, a feature of the earlier . By 1906 the Russo-Japanese War had shown that the 6-pounder gun was insufficiently effective, so the five 6-pounders in this class were replaced by three additional 12-pounders, creating an \\"all big gun\\" armament.Gardiner and Chesneau, p. 99 Performance With a general increase in size and more solid construction, the Rivers became the first truly oceangoing and useful torpedo boat destroyers in Royal Navy service. Despite making only 25 knots (previous classes had made under the most favourable conditions), the increased seaworthiness meant that they could maintain this speed into a sea and that they remained workable and fightable at the same time. Notwithstanding a variety of design differences, all ships had either two broad funnels or two pairs of narrow funnels. All ships surviving the war were sold out of service by late 1920. Ships HMS Welland Thirty-four ships were ordered - ten ships under the 1901-02 Programme, eight ships under the 1902-03 Programme (with one extra purchased when Palmers built it on speculation), and fifteen ships under the 1903-04 Programme; two additional vessels (also built on speculation) were purchased in 1909 under the 1908-09 Programme. *Hawthorn Leslie type; all built by Hawthorn Leslie, Hebburn, Newcastle upon Tyne.

The longer one is approximately with a span of 59 m and a maximum clearance to the sea of . The building of the old bridges started in 1911 and were opened in 1922. They cost . The old bridges still stand, but are not in a good shape. For the last few years before the new bridge was opened, the old bridges had restrictions on the weight and width of the cars that crossed it, and that meant that heavier traffic had to take a longer road through the village of Skodje. This was of course very impractical. With the new bridge in operation, the old bridges are now open only for pedestrians. History On 10 August 1880, two teachers wrote to the local council, requesting a road, going from the main road by Svortavatnet, to the Vatne lake, with a bridge over Straumen. It was not until 1909 that the local council agreed to pay to start the work on the bridge. Chief engineer Hovdenakk, from the Public Roads Administration office in Molde, constructed and led the work on the bridge.

Early years Peretz Markish was born in 1895 in Polonne, the Russian Empire (now Ukraine) to a Sephardi Jewish family. As a child he attended a cheder and sang in the choir of the local synagogue. He served as a private in the Russian Imperial Army during World War I. He was discharged from the army after the Russian Revolution, and settled in Ekaterinoslav (now Dnipropetrovsk), Ukraine. In 1918, he relocated to Kiev. Life Markish's first poetry collection, Shveln (\\"Thresholds\\"), published in Kiev in 1919, established his reputation. His poetry cycle Di kupe (\\"The Heap\\"; 1921) was written in response to the Ukrainian pogroms of 1919‚Äì20. Peretz Markish (in centre), with Mendl Elkin, Peretz Hirschbein, Uri Zvi Greenberg, Melech Ravitch and I. J. Singer in 1922. In the early 1920s, he was a member of the Kiev group of Yiddish poets that included David Hofstein and Leib Kvitko. After a series of pogroms took place in Ukraine, he moved to Warsaw and in Western Europe. While in Warsaw, he co-edited with I. J. Singer the expressionist literary anthology Khalyastre (\\"Gang\\"; 1922). Uri Zvi Grinberg and Melech Ravitch edited other literary publications. A second and final volume of Khalyastre, edited with Oser Varshawski, appeared in Paris in 1924 with a cover illustration by Marc Chagall. In 1924 he was a co-founder and editor of the Literarishe bleter in Warsaw. In 1926, Markish returned to the Soviet Union. There he published a number of optimistic poems glorifying the communist regime, including Mayn dor (\\"My Generation\\"; 1927) and the epic Brider (\\"Brothers\\"; 1929). His novel Dor oys, dor ayn (\\"Generation After Generation\\"; 1929), about the genesis of revolution in a small Jewish town, was condemned for \\"Jewish chauvinism.\\" As a co-founder of the Soviet School of Writers he was awarded the Order of Lenin in 1939. Markish joined the Soviet Communist party in early 1942http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Markish_Perets when he took a job at the International Division of Sovietinformburo, while a colleague Teumin was the press agent. The bureau head Lozovsky banned them from any further contact with JAC; effectively cutting them off from the international socialist element altogether. The monitors started looking through their post, investigating the articles they wrote. In April 1942, Stalin had ordered the formation of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee designed to influence international public opinion and organize political and material support for the Soviet fight against Nazi Germany, particularly from the West. Solomon Mikhoels, a popular actor and director of the Moscow State Jewish Theater, was appointed its chairman. Other members included Der Nister, Itzik Feffer and Samuel Halkin. They wrote texts and petitions almost as cries for help against the Nazi pogroms; among other countries the texts were printed in U.S. newspapers. The JAC also raised funds. In 1946, he was awarded the Stalin Prize, and wrote several paeans to Joseph Stalin, including a 20,000-line epic poem Milkhome (\\"War\\") in 1948. However, Stalin soon changed policy towards the liquidation of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee and against the remnants of official Jewish cultural activity in the Soviet Union. Solomon Mikhoels was murdered by the secret police in January 1948, to avoid a show trial. Other writers were accused of treason, and other \\"crimes\\", and arrested. Markish was accused of being a \\"Jewish nationalist\\", and arrested in January 1949, and shot with other Jewish writers during the Night of the Murdered Poets in August 1952. After Stalin's death, Markish's widow Esther and his sons, literary scholar Shimon Markish and prose writer David Markish, actively set out to redeem his memory. Following Markish's official rehabilitation in November 1955, several comprehensive editions of his poems, translated into Russian by Anna Akhmatova, were published in 1957. His oldest child, daughter Olga Rapay-Markish by his first wife, Zinaida Joffe, was a renowned Ukrainian ceramicist. Writings Markish wrote a number of poems and plays, as well as several novels. Markish is one of the three heroes, with his fellow Yiddish poets Uri Zvi Grinberg (1896‚Äì1981) and Melekh Ravitsh (1893‚Äì1976), of Gilles Rozier's novel D'un pays sans amour. (Paris, 2011) .

Sometimes the emotions expressed outwardly are very different from how the person feels on the inside. These strong emotions can be a disproportionate response to something that happened, but other times there might be no trigger at all. The person experiencing emotional lability usually feels like they do not have control over their emotions. For example, someone might cry uncontrollably in response to any strong emotion even if they do not feel sad or unhappy. Emotional lability is seen or reported in various conditions including borderline personality disorder, histrionic personality disorder, hypomanic or manic episodes of bipolar disorder, and neurological disorders or brain injury (where it is termed pseudobulbar affect), such as after a stroke. It has sometimes been found to have been a harbinger, or early warning, of certain forms of thyroid disease. Emotional lability also results from intoxication with certain substances, such as alcohol and benzodiazepines. It can also be an associated feature of ADHD. Children who display a high degree of emotional lability generally have low frustration tolerance and frequent crying spells or tantrums. During preschool, ADHD with emotional lability is associated with increased impairment and may be a sign of internalizing problems or multiple comorbid disorders. Children who are neglected are more likely to experience emotional dysregulation, including emotional lability. Potential triggers of emotional lability may be: excessive tiredness, stress or anxiety, over- stimulated senses (too much noise, being in large crowds, etc.), being around others exhibiting strong emotions, very sad or funny situations (such as jokes, movies, certain stories or books), death of a loved one, or other situations that elicit stress or strong emotions.

He introduced the Ward‚ÄìTakahashi identity, also known as \\"Ward Identity\\" (or \\"Ward's Identities\\"). Andrei Sakharov said Ward was one of the titans of quantum electrodynamics. He made significant contributions to quantum solid-state physics, statistical mechanics and the Ising model. Ward was one of the authors of the Standard Model of gauge particle interactions: his contributions were published in a series of papers he co-authored with Abdus Salam. He is also credited with being an early advocate of the use of Feynman diagrams. It has been said that physicists have made use of his principles and developments \\"often without knowing it, and generally without quoting him.\\" In 1955, Ward was recruited to work at the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Aldermaston. There, he independently derived a version of the Teller-Ulam design, for which he has been called the \\"father of the British H-bomb\\". Early life John Clive Ward was born in East Ham, London, on 1 August 1924. He was the son of Joseph William Ward, a civil servant who worked in Inland Revenue, and his wife Winifred Palmer, a schoolteacher. He had a sister, Mary Patricia. He attended Chalkwell Elementary School and Westcliff High School for Boys. In 1938 he sat for and won a ¬£100 scholarship to Bishop Stortford College. He took the Higher School Certificate Examination in 1942, receiving distinctions in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Latin, and was offered a postmastership (scholarship) to Merton College, Oxford. Although the Second World War was raging at the time, Ward was not called up by the Army, and was allowed to complete his Bachelor of Arts degree in Engineering Science with first class honours, studying mathematics under J. H. C. Whitehead and E. C. Titchmarsh. He received a bursary from the Harmsworth Trust, and in October 1946, with the war over, secured a position as a graduate assistant to Maurice Pryce, who had recently been appointed a professor of theoretical physics at Oxford.  Scientific contributions Quantum entanglement= In 1947, Ward and Pryce published a paper in Nature, in which they were the first to calculate, and use, probability amplitudes for the polarisation of a pair of quantum entangled photons moving in opposite directions. For polarisations x and y, Ward derived this probability amplitude to be: :\\\\left\\\\psi\\\\right\\\\rang=(\\\\leftx,y\\\\right\\\\rang - \\\\lefty,x\\\\right\\\\rang ) which can be normalised as: :\\\\left\\\\psi\\\\right\\\\rang= {1 \\\\over \\\\sqrt{2}}(\\\\leftx\\\\right\\\\rang_{1} \\\\lefty\\\\right\\\\rang_{2}- \\\\lefty\\\\right\\\\rang_{1} \\\\leftx\\\\right\\\\rang_{2}) This can be used to derive the correlation of the quantum polarisations of the two photons. Their prediction was confirmed experimentally by Chien-Shiung Wu and I. Shaknov in 1950. This was the first experimental confirmation of a pair of entangled photons as applicable to the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox. The result was subsequently explained by Richard Dalitz and Frank Duarte. Apparently following Dirac's doctrine, Ward was never bothered by issues of interpretation in quantum mechanics. With his Harmsworth scholarship expiring, and seeing few prospects at Oxford, Ward responded to a job advertisement from the University of Sydney. He was offered a position, but when he arrived, found that it was for a tutor, and not a lecturer. He therefore served out the year, then returned to Oxford to complete his Doctor of Philosophy (D.Phil.) thesis on \\"Some Properties of the Elementary Particles\\". Ward expected that his thesis, an elaboration of his 1947 paper, would be easily approved by the external examiner, Nicholas Kemmer, but at the last minute Kemmer's place was taken by Rudolf Peierls, who refused to accept it. Only after a forceful argument by the internal examiner, J. de Witt, was the thesis awarded. =Ward identity= Pryce arranged for Ward to receive an award from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) for two years. It was then that he developed the Ward‚ÄìTakahashi identity, originally known as \\"Ward Identity\\" (or \\"Ward's Identities\\"). This result in quantum electrodynamics was inspired by a conjecture of Freeman Dyson, and was disclosed in a one-half-page letter typical of Ward's succinct style. In their book Quantum Electrodynamics, Walter Greiner and state in their discussion of charge renormalisation: \\"the Ward Identity has a much more fundamental significance: it ensures the universality of the electromagnetic interaction.\\" In his book The Infinity Puzzle, Frank Close wrote: \\"Ward's Identities are the basic foundations on which the entire edifice of renormalisation rests.\\" In 1950, Ward's DSIR fellowship was coming to an end. Pryce had become a visiting professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and Ward's colleagues P. T. Matthews and Abdus Salam were visiting members there in the 1950‚Äì1951 academic year. Through them, he was able to secure a $3,000 membership for the 1951‚Äì1952 academic year. It was at Princeton that he was introduced to the Ising Model, and met Mark Kac from Cornell University, with whom he would collaborate on an exact solution of the Ising model using a combinatorial method. His joint work with Kac on the Ising Model gave rise to what is now being called the Kac-Ward operator. When his membership ended he worked for the Bell Laboratories in 1952 and 1953. He then accepted an offer of a lectureship at the University of Adelaide from Bert Green, where he worked for a year before taking up another membership at the Institute for Advanced Study. =Standard Model= Luttinger's theorem (introduced by J. M. Luttinger and Ward) relates a Fermi liquid's particle density to the volume of its Fermi surface. Ward left the British hydrogen bomb programme and took a job with an electronics company in California. Later in 1956, Elliott Montroll offered him a visiting professorship at the University of Maryland. Noting a recent paper by Keith Brueckner and Murray Gell-Mann on the ground state energy of an electron gas, Ward gave a lecture in which he proposed a different approach. Montroll recognised that this was Debye‚ÄìH√ºckel theory. Over the next few weeks, Ward later recalled, \\"We had managed not only to produce a definitive extension of a previously purely classical theory, but also to establish the rules for diagrammatic treatment of problems in quantum statistical mechanics, rules that are now the bread and butter of modern calculations.\\" Soon after, physicists were rocked by the news that Wu and Tsung-Dao Lee had demonstrated in the Wu experiment that parity is not conserved in weak interactions. This inspired Ward to consider particle physics again. Along with many others, he consider how gauge theory could be applied to Fermi's theory of beta decay. Ward became one of the authors of the Standard Model of gauge particle interactions; his contributions on electromagnetic and weak interactions were published in a series of papers he co-authored with Abdus Salam. Ward wrote a note to Abdus, informing him that Albert Einstein would be spinning in his grave, presumably clockwise. The contributions of Salam and Ward to the Standard Model were used in the development of the theoretical structure of the Higgs boson. Ward also made contributions to quantum mechanics, fermion theory, quantum solid-state physics, and statistical mechanics and the Ising model. Aldemaston In 1955, Ward was recruited by William Cook to work on the British hydrogen bomb programme at the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Aldermaston. The British government had decided that it needed hydrogen bombs, and it was Aldermaston's task to design one. Cook had been put in charge of the project in September 1954. Ward was the only theoretical physicist at Aldermaston; the director, William Penney, although a physicist, was an expert on hydrodynamics and instrumentation. Penney was not happy to have Ward forced on him, and the two did not get along. John Corner recalled that Ward did not fit in at Aldermaston. British knowledge of thermonuclear designs was limited to the work done by the wartime Manhattan Project: Edward Teller's Classic Super, and a 1946 design by John von Neumann and Klaus Fuchs. All that was known for certain about the American hydrogen bomb design was that it had multiple stages. \\"I was assigned\\", Ward later recalled, \\"the improbable job of uncovering the secret of the Ulam-Teller invention ... an idea of genius far beyond the talents of the personnel at Aldermaston, a fact well-known to both Cook and Penney.\\" After working through a large number of proposals, Ward hit upon a workable design incorporating staging, compression and radiation implosion. At a meeting on 2 December 1955, Ward sketched it on the blackboard. Penny's response was cool, regarding it as too complicated, but Cook recognised it as worthy. Although Ward's design was not the one ultimately adopted for the hydrogen bombs used in Operation Grapple, the concept was influential, and the development of a more advanced design than the Americans had would be the key to achieving the overall objective of the project‚Äîa resumption of the nuclear Special Relationship with the Americans. He has been called the \\"father of the British H-bomb\\". Macquarie University After Maryland, Ward looked for a new job. He thought he had found one at the University of Miami in Florida, but was denied tenure and left in 1959. He then secured a position at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, but was unhappy there. He applied once again for a one-year membership at the Institute for Advanced Study, and was accepted for a third time. Theodore H. Berlin then offered him a position at Johns Hopkins University in 1961. He remained until 1966, when he answered an advertisement for a mathematics professor at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand. Australian friends were astounded that anyone would choose New Zealand over Australia, and in 1967 he became the foundation professor of physics at Macquarie University in Sydney. He turned down offers from Oxford and Cambridge. He eventually became an Australian citizen. In 1967 he created the physics program at Macquarie University using the Feynman Lectures on Physics as primary textbooks. This program had a strong experimental emphasis and Ward himself (who originally was trained as an engineer) \\"had great admiration for anything practical\\". He is credited with being an early pioneer in the use of Feynman diagrams, and spreading their use in Australia. In the late 1970s Ward participated, with Frank Duarte, in the successful Macquarie science reform movement, and considered this a \\"most important accomplishment\\". The most visible sign was that the university agreed to present Bachelor of Science (BSc) degrees instead of just Bachelor of Arts (BA) degrees, the former being more highly prized by students and workplaces in Australia. Personal life and death Ward's total number of published papers was only about 20, a fact that reflects a strong sense of self- criticism. He was also critical of what he called \\"PhD factories\\" and expressed scepticism towards the importance attached to having a large number of citations. He never supervised graduate students. Although he never received the Nobel Prize in Physics, he did receive some significant awards, including the Guthrie Medal and Dirac Medal in 1981, the Heineman Prize in 1982, and the Hughes Medal in 1983 \\"for his highly influential and original contributions to quantum field theory, particularly the Ward identity and the Salam-Ward theory of weak interactions\\". He became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1965. He has an Erd≈ës number of 2. Andrei Sakharov said Ward was one of the \\"titans\\" of quantum electrodynamics alongside Freeman Dyson, Richard Feynman, Julian Schwinger, Sin-Itiro Tomonaga and Gian Carlo Wick. In this regard, it has been said that physicists have made use of his principles and developments \\"often without knowing it, and generally without quoting him.\\" Besides his physics, Ward played the piano and the French horn. He was a bachelor for most of his life, but he was briefly married while in the US. He had no children. He died on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada, on 6 May 2000, from a respiratory illness.

History In June 1917, before the first A7V tanks had been completed, the German War Ministry ordered the development of a new superheavy tank intended to be used in break-through situations. Design work was carried out by Joseph Vollmer, a reserve captain and engineer working for the Verkehrstechnische Pr√ºfungskommission (\\"Transport-technologies Board of Examiners\\" of the army), and a Captain Weger. On June 28, 1917 the War Ministry approved the draft design and ordered ten examples, five to be built by the Riebe ball-bearing factory in Berlin and five by Wegmann & Co. of Kassel. The vehicle originally weighed 165 tons but this was reduced to a more practicable 120 tons by shortening the length. The huge size and mass of the K-Wagen made it impossible to transport, so it was decided that it would be split into sections for transport by rail, to be reassembled behind the front line near where it was to be used. Two prototypes were built at the request of Hindenburg, and were almost complete by the end of the war. Description Drawing of a K-Wagen The hull of the K-Wagen consisted of six modules that could be transported separately by rail: the control room, the fighting room, the engine room, the transmission room and the two sponsons. The commander could give orders to the crew by means of electric lights: fire control was comparable to that of a destroyer, the Germans seeing the vehicle as a veritable \\"landship\\". The drivers would have had to steer the vehicle blindly, directed by the commander. The K-Wagen was to be armed with four 77 mm fortress guns and seven MG08 machine guns and had a crew of 27: a commander, two drivers, a signaler, an artillery officer, 12 artillery men, eight machine gunners and two mechanics. At the beginning of the project the incorporation of flamethrowers was considered but later rejected. The K-Wagen never became operational as under the conditions of the Armistice Germany was forbidden to possess tanks. One of the tanks, \\"Ribe\\" was complete at the end of the war, but it never left the factory and was scrapped under the watchful eyes of the Military Inter-Allied Commission of Control.

She was built by Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company (Govan, Scotland), her keel was laid down on 2 September 1937. She was launched on 25 March 1939, and commissioned on 30 September 1940. HistoryMediterranean= HM King George VI and HM Queen Elizabeth on board, coming alongside the quay at Belfast in 1942 Phoebes first six months were spent in the Home Fleet, escorting troop convoys on the first stage of their long voyage via the Cape to the Middle East. In April 1941 she was transferred to the 7th Cruiser Squadron in the Mediterranean. Enemy-held territory here was to keep the British Fleet busy for the next two-and-a-half years, and Phoebe was to have her fair share of the action. One of her first operations was the evacuation of troops from Greece and Crete, which was followed quickly by the Syria landings and transporting troops to and from Tobruk. =Africa= On 23 October 1942, Phoebe was torpedoed by the German submarine off the Congo Estuary, while on passage to French Equatorial Africa. Her route was from Simonstown in South Africa to Freetown Sierra Leone but the ship had to refuel at Pointe Noire. Two U-boats (U-161 and ) were patrolling that area at the time. After the hit, a corvette coming up from the harbour prevented the U-boat from finishing off the cruiser. About 60 crew members were killed. After temporary repairs, Phoebe made for New York for complete repairs. It was an incredible feat to sail with a gaping hole () in her hull. The repairs were not completed until June 1943. In October 1943, she returned to the Mediterranean to take part in the Aegean operations. =Far East= In May 1944, Phoebe was transferred to the Eastern Fleet and was involved in strike operations against the Andaman Islands, Sabang in Northern Sumatra and the Nicobar Islands. In January 1945, she was switched to supporting amphibious operations in Burma and was engaged in actions against Akyab, Ramree Island off the Arakan Coast, and Cheduba Island. From April to May 1945, Phoebe was involved in the amphibious assault on Rangoon as part of the East Indies Fleet's, 21st Aircraft Carrier Squadron. =Post war= After VJ-Day, Phoebe returned home for refitting and spent five years in the peacetime Mediterranean Fleet. In early 1948, the cruiser took elements of Royal Marines 40 Commando to Haifa, to assist in the British withdrawal from Mandate Palestine. On 30 June Phoebe embarked the last G. O. C.

As a player, he made five appearances for Cheshunt in the 1981‚Äì82 season.  Stevenage  In 1990 Stevenage Borough employed Paul Fairclough as manager, who had previously managed Hertfordshire neighbours Hertford Town. After two fourth-placed finishes, under the management of Fairclough, Stevenage won The Isthmian League Division Two North in 1990‚Äì91, winning 34 of their 42 games, including every match played at home, scoring 122 goals and amassing 107 points. The following season Fairclough led the club to the Division One championship, remaining unbeaten at home again, and were promoted to the Premier Division. The club's long unbeaten home record was finally ended by Dulwich Hamlet, with the streak lasting 44 matches, of which 42 were won. In 1993‚Äì94, still under Paul Fairclough's reins, the club won the Premier Division, and were promoted to the Football Conference. Two seasons later Fairclough led Stevenage to win the Conference, but they were denied promotion to the Football League due to insufficient ground facilities. In 1998 Fairclough guided Stevenage into the FA Cup fourth round. They were awarded a home tie against Newcastle United, which they drew 1‚Äì1 against all odds, and subsequently were awarded a replay at St James' Park. Stevenage lost 2‚Äì1 in a controversial game, as Alan Shearer's header, awarded a goal by the referee, may or may not have crossed the line. Video evidence shows that a Stevenage defender appeared to have made a magnificent clearance.  Barnet  Fairclough was appointed caretaker manager of Barnet for the final few months of the 2003‚Äì04 Conference National season, replacing the popular Martin Allen who had controversially left the North Londoners for Brentford in March 2004. Initially there was some scepticism surrounding Fairclough's appointment due to his history with rivals Stevenage Borough. Despite some edgy performances, Fairclough kept Barnet's promotion hopes alive, cementing 4th place and setting up a play-off semi- final with Shrewsbury Town. Barnet won the first leg at Underhill 2‚Äì1 thanks to a dramatic injury-time header from Bees defender Simon Clist. The second leg was a cagey affair and the tie was eventually settled on penalties ‚Äì Barnet losing 5‚Äì3 in the shootout. Although the team had failed to reach the play-off final, Fairclough was handed the job on a permanent basis shortly after by Barnet chairman Tony Kleanthous. In his first full season as Barnet manager Fairclough determined to make up for the previous season's disappointment. The team took the Conference by storm. Following an excellent start to the campaign, the Bees propelled themselves to the top of the division, a position they occupied for the majority of the season. Fairclough's side produced some excellent performances both at Underhill and on the road, including the 3‚Äì1 victory over promotion rivals Carlisle United in mid-October, watched by a then-record Conference crowd of 9,215. With a solid defence marshalled by captain Ian Hendon, and 29 goals from striker Giuliano Grazioli, Barnet won the Conference title, securing automatic promotion to the Football League and finishing 12 points clear of their closest challengers with a vastly superior goal difference. In his maiden venture into League management Fairclough successfully fought off relegation back to the Conference, ensuring Barnet's Football League status with victory over Rushden & Diamonds on the final day of the season. The highlight of the campaign undoubtedly came in late October when Fairclough's men travelled north to take on Manchester United in the third round of the League Cup. During the 2006‚Äì07 campaign, Fairclough led Barnet to the Fourth Round of the FA Cup ‚Äì the first time in the club's history. Indeed, the team's league position improved significantly on the previous season, finishing well clear of the relegation zone in 14th place. Despite this, Fairclough has expressed his disappointment with the season overall, bemoaning his side's failure to draw a \\"big fish\\" in the FA Cup which could have seen a sizeable cash injection into the club. Fairclough was also critical of his team's performances on the pitch, in particular some of his side's defensive displays. As a result, he signalled his intentions for a squad shake-up in the close season, releasing a number of first team players just days after their final league match. By the time Christmas arrived in the 2008‚Äì09 season, Barnet had only won three league matches, and would have been in dire relegation trouble had it not been for the deduction of points at the beginning of the season from Luton Town, Rotherham United and Bournemouth. After losing at home to Aldershot Town on Boxing Day, Fairclough decided it was time to step down after the game at Bournemouth on 28 December. The players responded magnificently and put in a performance which gained an important 2‚Äì0 win to finish Fairclough's reign on a high. In April 2010 Fairclough was made caretaker manager at Barnet after the sacking of Ian Hendon, guiding the Bees to safety with a 1‚Äì0 win over Rochdale on the last day of the season. He was made Temporary Manager till the end of the season in early 2011 following the sacking of Mark Stimson however stepped down with 8 games to go and was replaced by Martin Allen. He began his fourth managerial spell at Barnet in January 2014 following the departure of Edgar Davids.Fairclough named interim manager After a 1‚Äì3 loss at home to Aldershot Town he resigned and was replaced by Ulrich Landvreugd and Dick Schreuder.

Models  There were several models of the JavaStation produced, some being pre-production variants produced in very small numbers. Production models comprised: * JavaStation-1 (part number JJ-xx), codenamed Mr. Coffee: based on a 110 MHz MicroSPARC IIe CPU, this was housed in a cuboidal Sun \\"unidisk\\" enclosure. * JavaStation-NC or JavaStation-10 (part number JK-xx) codenamed Krups: a redesigned Mr. Coffee with a 100 MHz MicroSPARC IIep CPU and enhanced video resolution and color capabilities. Krups was housed in a striking curved vertically oriented enclosure. Models produced only as prototypes or in limited numbers included: * JavaStation/Fox: a prototype of the Mr Coffee: essentially a repackaged SPARCstation 4 Model 110. * JavaStation-E (part number JE-xx) codenamed Espresso: a Krups with PCI slots and a non-functional ATA interface in a restyled enclosure. * Dover: a JavaStation based on PC compatible hardware, with a Cyrix MediaGXm CPU. * JavaEngine-1: an ATX form-factor version of Krups for embedded systems. * A 68030-based system designed by Diba, Inc. (later acquired by Sun) circa 1996, which could be considered a very early JavaStation-like system. In addition, Sun envisioned a third-generation \\"Super JavaStation\\" after Krups, with a JavaChip co-processor for native Java bytecode execution. This doesn't appear to have been produced. The JavaStation concept was superseded by the Sun Ray series of thin client terminals.  Operating systems  The JavaStation comes with JavaOS in the flash memory, but it is also possible to install Linux or NetBSD on the JavaStation.

Cricket writer, Colin Bateman, stated, \\"he was the best slow left-arm bowler Lancashire had seen this century and, at 22, was in the Test side, seemingly set for life. Hilton, however, suffered the spinners' nightmare, the jitters, and lost his way at times\\". Bateman added, \\"He also, say colleagues, enjoyed cricket's social life a little too much although his 1,006 first-class wickets still cost only 19 apiece\\". Early career Hilton was born in Chadderton, Lancashire. He began playing in the Central Lancashire League at Werneth Cricket Club as a teenager in 1945, and made his first-class debut in 1946 against Sussex at Hove, scoring 2 not out and taking one wicket. He came into prominence at the age of 19 by dismissing Donald Bradman twice in Lancashire's match with the Australians in May 1948, making national newspaper headlines.Brightly Fades The Don ‚Äì Jack Fingleton(1949) His first 10 wickets were Test batsmen, but Lancashire kept him from the front line up to the end of 1949, until the late Bill Roberts and Eric Price were no longer on the staff. He took 103 wickets for the Second Eleven in the Minor Counties Championship in 1949 and, in 1950, he gained a permanent place in the First Eleven taking 125 wickets for less than 17 runs apiece. He was called up for the final Test match against the West Indies but was not successful. England In 1951, he bowled with great steadiness against the South Africans,Wisden 1952 taking 3 for 176 in the first innings on a featherbed pitch at Headingley during the fourth Test Match. He toured India the following winter, but was criticised in Wisden as lacking the ability to exploit the Indian type of pitch. Despite this, at Kanpur in the Fourth Test he took nine wickets in the match, and led England to victory, alongside his off-spinning Lancastrian colleague Roy Tattersall. Career in the mid-1950s However, in 1952, Lancashire began a period of indecision. Hilton often alternated with Bob Berry, a policy that adversely affected both players.John Kay in Lancs summary Playfair CA 1953 & 1954 In 1953, Hilton played irregularly but returned in the wet summer of 1954 to take 96 wickets. In 1955, although occasionally left out, he took 104 wickets and scored his only century in even time against Northamptonshire. 1956 was Hilton's best season. He took 147 wickets and was chosen as one of Wisden Cricketers of the Year. However, in 1957, he lost accuracy and was frequently left out in favour of Tommy Greenhough. He came back with 94 wickets in 1958, including a career best 8 for 19 against the New Zealanders. His younger brother Jim played a few times for Lancashire, and more often for Somerset. At Weston-super-Mare in 1956, Malcolm Hilton took 14 Somerset wickets and Jim Hilton responded with eight Lancashire victims.

General Count Jean Rapp (27 April 1771 - 8 November 1821) was a French Army officer during the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. Rapp was born the son of the janitor of the town-hall of Colmar, then located in the Old Customs House. He began theological studies to become a clergyman, but with his build and heated character, he was better suited to the military, which he joined in March 1788. From the rank of a regular of the chasseurs de C√©vennes, he worked his way up through his courage and character to the rank of a division general and adjutant of Napoleon Bonaparte. As a lieutenant, his reputation grew through his impetuousness as well as the wounds he received in battle. He was made aide-de-camp of Louis Desaix, who named him captain and took him to Egypt, where Rapp distinguished himself at Sediman, capturing an enemy battery. For that he was given a squadron and later a brigade by Napoleon. After the Egyptian campaign, Rapp remained under the command of Desaix until the latter's death at Marengo on 14 June 1800. He then became aide-de-camp of Napoleon, then the First Consul, a post he held until 1814. Under this title, he was charged with many confidential missions by Napoleon in the Vend√©e, Switzerland and Belgium. In 1803 he was promoted to brigadier general and in December 1805, he led a memorable attack at Austerlitz, when he charged at the head of two squadrons each of the Mounted Chasseurs and the Mounted Grenadiers of the Guard and the Guard Mameluks and decimated the Chevalier Guards of the Russian Imperial Guard. Promoted to division general, he later fought at Jena on 14 October 1806 and was wounded at Golymin. Rapp stayed in the line of fire: at Essling, he led the front of his fusiliers of the Garde imp√©riale and carried the day; during the signing of the Treaty of Sch√∂nbrunn, he averted a planned attempt on Napoleon by the young Friedrich Staps; in Russia, he was wounded by four bullets at the battle of Moscow on 5‚Äì7 September 1812. He saved Napoleon's life a second time by repelling an attack of Cossacks at the Gorodnia and was again wounded at the passage of the Berezina, fighting alongside Ney in the rear guard. As governor of Danzig, Rapp held the town for a year after the Grande Arm√©e left Russia. During the Hundred Days, Rapp rallied to Napoleon and was given command of V Corps, consisting of about 20,000 men. It was used to observe the border near Strasbourg,Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition, Waterloo Campaign and to defend the Vosges. Ten days after the battle of Waterloo (in which his corps took no part), he met some Coalition forces near Strasbourg and defeated them at the Battle of La Suffel. After the Waterloo Campaign, he offered his resignation several times, but was reinstated. Later, Rapp became a deputy of the department of Haut-Rhin and was appointed as treasurer of Louis XVIII in 1819. He died in Rheinweiler in Baden. His hometown of Colmar built a statue in his honor on the Champ de Mars with the inscription Ma parole est sacr√©e (my word of honour is sacred). Rapp's heart is kept in a shrine in the √âglise Saint-Matthieu, Colmar.

He is best remembered as the creator of one of Australia's longest running children's shows Mr. Squiggle. Hetherington was the sole operator and voice of its star performer, the Mr. Squiggle marionette. Family He was the son of Frederick Hetherington (1883‚Äì1951) and Ellen Mary Hetherington (1888‚Äì1976) (n√©e Markwell). They were married at Balmain, New South Wales in 1918, and Norman Frederick Hetherington was born on 29 May 1921 in Lilyfield. He grew up at 35 Meryla Street, Burwood. He did his primary schooling from Burwood Public School (1927‚Äì1933), and secondary schooling at Sydney's Fort Street Boys' High School (1934‚Äì1937). He studied art, full-time, at East Sydney Technical College (now known as the National Art School), from 1937‚Äì1938; and, because he had taken a position with one of Sydney's largest advertising agencies, Lintas (Lever International Advertising), he transferred to part-time studies, studying at night from 1939 to 1941 (when he enlisted in the army). In 1958, he married Margaret (n√©e Purnell); she would later write the scripts for all episodes of Mr. Squiggle. They moved to the Sydney suburb of Mosman in 1960, and Hetherington remained there until his death.Mr. Squiggle: Who's Pulling the Strings? , Mosman Festival, 3 September 2005.

The Entertainment Unit also included actor Michael Pate, and comedian George Wallace Jr. Cartoonist He had attended classes at the National Art School before the war; and once the war was over, he continued his studies, and attended classes there four nights a week.McDonald, J., \\"Drawn from the ranks\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, (Saturday, 2 August 2008). When he was only 15, and still a student at Fort Street Boys' High School, Hetherington sold his first cartoon to The Bulletin magazine. He contributed to The Bulletin from time to time over the next few years; and he even continued to do so whilst he was in the army.Hetherington, N., \\"My Bulletin Days\\", 1946-1961, Biblionews and Australian Notes & Queries, No. 360, (December 2008), pp.143-147. As a freelance cartoonist he sold work to magazines that included Man, Man Junior, Army, Humour and Quiz: \\"His modus operandi was to approach the best-paying magazine first and continue on until he got down to the worst paying with whatever was left of his work\\".Foyle (2010) He was discharged from the army in May 1946, and was immediately asked to join the full-time Bulletin staff; he continued to work for The Bulletin until 1961 (when all of the staff were sacked by Frank Packer, its new owner). He had worked alongside such luminaries as Norman Lindsay, Ted Scorfield and Percy Lindsay. =Signature= \\"Heth 42, Cartoonist\\", one of the stars at the Army Entertainment Unit concert for the \\"Penny-a-Plane\\" Appeal, Ambassadors Theatre , Perth, Sunday, 15 November 1942. Early in his career, he signed his cartoons and caricatures with \\"Heth\\" and the last two digits of the year: a signature of, say, \\"Heth 42\\" (see advertisement at right) identifies Hetherington as the artist of the work, and 1942 as the year in which it had been drawn.For example, he signed his 1946 self-portrait as \\"Heth 46\\" (see ). In the late 1940s, he changed his manner of signing his cartoons; it was no longer written horizontally, and it no longer displayed the year's last two digits. Whilst the signature \\"Heth\\" was still exclusively written in capital letters; it now took the form of \\"HETH\\", rather than \\"HETH\\". The letters were now rotated sideways, and the signature was written vertically running down the page from the top-left to the bottom-right (see left); and was read with one's head tilted to the right. Many of those who were not aware of this imagined he was signing his work with (non-rotated) imitations of a number of Chinese characters, traditionally written vertically, that needed to be read with one's head tilted to the left.Foyle and Carman (2010) speak of the signature appearing to have been \\"written in a Chinese-like jumble\\"; and, given the following genuine Chinese characters ‚Äî Â§ß, Âúü, Â£´, Â£≥, Ê≠£, Ëµ∞, Â§©, and Âõ† ‚Äî can be found within his signature (see ), this impression was widespread. PuppetryPopular Science Monthly= His interest in marionettes began in 1935 when his father, who was the head carpenter for a major shipping line, gave him a copy of an American magazine called Popular Science Monthly, which contained instructions for making a puppet out of used bicycle inner tubes.This was an article by Florence Fetherston Drake, on how to make marionettes from old inner tubes, that commenced on page 58 of Popular Science Monthly, Vol. 127, No. 3, (September 1935) THE BALLARD INSTITUTE AND MUSEUM OF PUPPETRY: Practical Marionettes Made From Old Inner Tubes. Later articles (which, along with that first article, were eventually accumulated into the booklet How to Make Your Own Marionettes () were: Drake, F.F., \\"Its Great Fun to Give a Circus at Home With These Comical Animal Puppets\\", Popular Science Monthly, Vol. 127, No. 6, (December 1935), pp.67, 92-93; Drake, F.F., \\"Puppet Heads Modeled from Newspaper Pulp\\", Popular Science Monthly, Vol. 128, No. 1, (January 1936), pp.57, 90-91; Drake, F.F., \\"Marionette Bodies\\", Popular Science Monthly, Vol. 128, No. 2, (February 1936), pp.65, 109-111; Drake, F.F., \\"Constructing Simple Marionette Stages\\", Popular Science Monthly, Vol. 128, No. 3, (March 1936), pp.64-65, 105; Drake, F.F., \\"Stage Sets and Scenery for Marionette Shows\\", Popular Science Monthly, Vol. 128, No. 4, (April 1936), pp.71, 106-108; Drake, F.F., \\"Properties for Marionette Shows\\", Popular Science Monthly, Vol. 128, No. 5, (May 1936), pp.70-71, 103-105; Drake, F.F., \\"Lighting the Miniature Stage\\", Popular Science Monthly, Vol. 129, No. 1, (July 1936), pp.67, 91-92; and Drake, F.F., \\"Trick Marionettes Will Enliven Your Puppet Shows\\", Popular Science Monthly, Vol. 129, No. 5, (November 1936), pp.72-73, 83-105. In a 1971 interview,Toshack, (1971). he told Marie Toshack that he made his first \\"professional puppet\\" in 1952. It was a clown, made specifically for a puppet show called \\"The Reluctant Dragon\\", at the old Mercury Theatre. Even in these first shows, critics were remarking on the \\"wit, whimsy, and lively inventiveness\\" of his performance with his marionettes, and were very impressed with the skill and craftsmanship with which his puppets had been created.L.B., \\"Puppets at the Mercury\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, (Monday, 22 June 1953), p.4. In a 1977 interview,Molloy, (1977). Hetherington explained to Sue Molloy that his interest in marionettes \\"was the outcome of a professional interest in cartoons, and amateur interest in theatre and a hobby of puppets\\", remarking that, in his view, \\"puppets are only three-dimensional cartoons\\". =Clovelly Puppet Theatre= In the interview he also revealed that his burgeoning puppet hobby had been further developed, after the war, under the guidance of the psychologist, Doris Mary Matheson (1896‚Äì1969), who, along with her sister Elsie Grace Rivett (1887‚Äì1964), had founded the Children's Library and Crafts Movement in 1934 (which became the Creative Leisure Movement in 1969).For more on Doris Mary Matheson, n√©e Rivett (1896-1969) and Elsie Grace Rivett (1887-1964), see Godden, G., \\"Rivett, Doris Mary (1896‚Äì1969)\\", Australian Dictionary of Biography, 1988. Driven by the support, encouragement and guidance of Mrs. Matheson, Hetherington became involved, along with Richard Bradshaw,Carr, V., \\"The Actor in the Wings\\", The Australian Women's Weekly, (Wednesday, 26 February 1969), p.7.; Benson, P.D., \\"Good Show, Super 'Roo\\", The Australian Women's Weekly, (Wednesday, 25 September 1974), p.113. and Edith Constance Murray (n√©e Blackwell) (1897‚Äì1988),Design and Art Australia Online Biography: Edith Constance Murray; for many years Edith, who was a foundation member of the Puppetry Guild of NSW, and served as its Secretary for many years is generally regarded today as the founder of as the founder of UNIMA Australia (Union Internationale de la Marionnette, of the International Puppetry Association). with regular performances at the sisters' Clovelly Puppet Theatre (which they had established in 1949),Richard Bradshaw and Katharine Brisbane, \\"Puppet Theatre\\", pp.82-85 in Rubin, D.

Describing it as \\"a nurturing ground\\", Hetherington said that this was where and when his puppetry changed from being just a hobby into a lifelong interest.Molloy, (1977); Bradshaw, (December 2010). Milne, G., Theatre Australia (Un)Limited: Australian Theatre Since the 1950s, Rodopi, (Amsterdam), 2004. =Meryla Marionettes= During the 1950s, whilst pursuing his own rapidly developing personal interest in puppetry, he created a number of shows with the group he led, the Meryla Puppet Group.Mercury Theatre, The (Sydney) Sunday Herald, (Sunday, 14 June 1953), p.16. He was soon working on his own, as The Meryla Marionettes, with a series of shows that were very popular with children.Hetherington chose to use the name \\"Meryla\\" because that was (a) the name of the street in which he grew up, (b) had learned how to manipulate a marionette, and (c) had constructed his first puppets. It is also significant that, in the first few decades, his single operator puppet shows were always introduced as \\"The Meryla Marionettes present‚Ä¶\\", rather than as \\"Norman Hetherington presents‚Ä¶\\". Eventually, however, they became known as The Norman Hetherington Puppets (e.g., ; ). In November 1957, he was performing on stage for children during Saturday matinees at Sydney cinemas; and performing at three different locations on the one afternoon . Along with Igor's Puppets, the Merlya Marionettes performed on stage at the children's matinees at The Coronet Cinema, Bondi Junction, The Sixways Cinema, at Bondi, and the Randwick Cinema, at Randwick, on Saturday 23 November 1957;Hoyts Suburban Theatres: Special Children‚Äôs Matinee, The Sydney Morning Herald, (Saturday 23 November 1957), p.22. and at The Bondi Road Cinema, at Bondi, The Sixways Cinema, at Bondi, and The Woollahra Cinema, at Woollahra on Saturday 30 November 1957.Hoyts Suburban Theatres: Special Children‚Äôs Matinee, The Sydney Morning Herald, (Saturday, 30 November 1957), p.22. Hetherington (assisted by Annette MacArthur-Onslow) and his puppets also performed live, on television, on Christmas Day 1957.ABN Channel 2: Wednesday 25 December 1957: 4:00PM: \\"KINDERGARTEN PLAYTIME ‚Äî Jan McKay introduces the Meryla Puppets with Norm. Hetherington and Annette MacArthur-Onslow\\", Sydney Morning Herald TV Guide, (Monday, 23 December 1957), p.4. In the beginning, the shows were often performed at children's libraries. Hetherington was always keen to demonstrate to his young audiences just how easily puppets could be made. From time to time, his own children participated in his performances for the Australian Theatre for Young People during the school holidays,For example, in the school holidays of May 1969, his son Stephen assisted his father in presenting a series of shows: Some Holiday Treats for the Children, The (Sydney) Sun-Herald, (Sunday, 11 May, 1969), p.128. and also in the shows that he presented at various Department Stores (Anthony Horden's, Farmer's, Grace Bros., and David Jones, etc.), such as \\"Enchanted Scarecrow\\", \\"The Magic Tinderbox\\", \\"The Moon for Supper\\" and \\"Nicky's Christmas Snowman\\".For example, See These Today: Free Puppet Show!, The Sydney Morning Herald, (Wednesday 8 September 1954), p.11; Youngsters Meet the Stars, The Sydney Morning Herald, (Thursday, 2 September 1954), p.3; Puppet Show, The Sydney Morning Herald's Women's Section, (Thursday, 15 December 1955), p.5. =Puppet designer= His innovative and creative design and construction skills were such that, from time to time, he was also asked to design puppets for others to operate in their own shows.In 1990, for example, he designed and constructed a set of puppets for Maddy Slabacu's performance of Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Books (Cochrane, 1990); and he designed and constructed all the puppets for Richard Bradshaw's performance of The Mysterious Potamus in 1979 (Camens, (1979). The photograph of \\"Smiley\\" on the front page of The Sydney Morning Herald of Tuesday 2 June 1970, provides a beautiful sense of just how wonderfully skilled Hetherington was in designing and constructing puppets, and the detailed, intricate nature of the mechanical devices and the special sets that he designed for his shows, and just how much children loved them. Television Having attended the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's (ABC) television training school some time prior to the introduction of television to Australia,History of the ABC: The 50s - The Postwar Years, Hetherington began his television career in 1956,Australia's National TV: ABN Channel 2 Commences: Fascinating Puppet Shows, The Sydney Morning Herald, (Monday, 5 November 1956), p.7. creating Nicky and Noodle for the ABC,ABV 2 (26 March 1959) 5PM. and another series, Jolly Gene and His Fun Machine for Channel Seven in 1957.ATN 7 (7 October 1957), 5PM.

The marionette had a very heavy head, and it was always manipulated by and voiced by Hetherington himself as the sole operator. Since the images were drawn upside down, Hetherington would lie above the set in the rafters above looking down at the drawing whilst operating the marionette. The gentle politeness of Mr. Squiggle, and the gentle strength of Hetherington's well-modulated voice was immediately attractive to children, at a time when most of the other Australian TV channels had violent, raucous, and brash ventriloquist acts associated with their children's shows.Shelley, G., \\"20 Years of Mr. Squiggle\\", The Herald TV Guide, The Sydney Morning Herald, (Monday, 2 July 1979), p.8. Exploiting the \\"fusion\\" of his skills as both puppeteer and cartoonist, he used the tip of the pencil that formed the puppet's nose to convert \\"squiggles\\" that had been sent in to the television station by young viewers into full-realised drawings and cartoons. Most significantly, given all of the mechanics of his marionette's performance, all of these \\"squiggle\\" conversions by Mr. Squiggle were always performed with the original children's drawing up-side down. When asked, in 2009, in one of the \\"Moment in Time\\" segments of the ABC TV programme Can We Help?, on behalf of a viewer, Miriam Webster,\\"Miriam Webster from Willoughby has sent us in search of the secret behind Mr. Squiggle's famous nose. Who better to ask than his creator, Norman Hetherington?\\": Moment in Time, Can We Help?, Episode 36, Friday 16 October 2009. whether Mr. Squiggle had lead in his pencil or whether it was \\"something more extraterrestrial\\", Norman Hetherington replied: \\"It started off with a very large felt pen, a very thick felt pen; but, in Studio 23, we were very close to the lights, and the heat would dry up the felt, and it wasn't very good, so we graduated to crayon, and then to oil chalk, and then [to] chalk.\\"ABC TV: Transcript: \\"What was Mr. Squiggle's nose made from?\\", Moment in Time, Can We Help?, Episode 36, Friday 16 October 2009. Initially intended as a temporary fill-in,In a 2008 interview with Matthew Perkins, Hetherington said that he had been given a week's notice that the ABC TV wanted him to perform; and that, quite unusually, he was not required to audition (Perkins, 2008). the show ran on ABC for 40 years,Spacewalk time , Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 1 September 2005. Mr. Squiggle's first appearance on ABC TV was on 1 July 1959, and he drew his last picture on ABC TV on 9 July 1999.Australian film and television chronology: The 1950s: National Film and Sound Archive. When interviewed by Sarah Collerton in 2009, Hetherington told her that \\"I taught Mr. Squiggle to draw and now he draws better than I do\\".Collerton, (2009). In May 1999, Mr. Squiggle was honoured by Australia Post with his own 45-cent postage stamp.In May 1999, Australia Post issued a set of five different stamps, featuring four of the best-loved children's television programmes. Along with the stamp featuring Mr. Squiggle (who \\"starred\\" as the centre of the group), there was one stamp for Here's Humphrey, one stamp for Bananas in Pyjamas, and on the other side of Mr. Squiggle, two stamps for Play School. There was also a special first day cover for the set: Children's TV, Australian Stamp Bulletin, No. 250, (May-July 1999), p.3. Smiley's Good Teeth Puppet Theatre In March 1962, the Dental Health Education and Research Foundation was established at the University of Sydney to promote the philosophy and practice of preventive dentistry and, in particular, communicate positive dental health messages to the general population. Preliminary studies had convinced the Foundation that \\"dental health literature of a hand-out nature was virtually useless unless it was used to supplement information or knowledge already passed on to the recipient by a dentist or some other authoritative person\\".Woolley, (1980), p.249. Moreover, it was soon found that the presence of Dental Health Educators in primary schools, instructing children up to 12 years in such things as diet, oral hygiene and plaque control, was not as effective as anticipated. In 1967, Hetherington was consulted by the Foundation; and, with the initial notion of strongly augmenting the work of the Dental Health Educators, he was responsible for establishing the \\"Smiley's Good Teeth Puppet Theatre\\", starring a new puppet, Smiley (\\"a little boy who gets toothache because he has not looked after his teeth properly\\"),Anon, (1969). that delivered performances based on a script that had been produced in collaboration with the Foundation, that featured all of its desired preventive dentistry messages. The first performance‚Äîwhich, it had been decided by that time, would run \\"in parallel with\\" (rather than \\"as part of\\") the dental health educator programme‚Äîwas in February 1968, with the specific target of the younger, primary school children. The shows were performed with two puppeteers, with the assistant operating Smiley, and Hetherington everything else.One of his assistants was Geoff. Murray, the grandson of Edith Murray The show, and its associated Good Teeth Club‚Äîto which Hetherington, having emerged from behind the puppet stage, would invite the delighted children to join at the end of each of his performances (Anon, 1970)The Certificate of Membership of the Good Teeth Club, indicated that the member had promised to do three things: \\"I will keep my teeth clean\\", \\"I will eat the right food and give my teeth plenty of chewing exercise\\", and \\"I will visit my dentist three times a year\\" (Anon, 1969).‚Äîwas immensely popular with the school children immediately it began its operation.Column Eight, The Sydney Morning Herald, (Monday, 5 August 1968), p.1. The Foundation was overjoyed to discover that evaluations showed that, even after six months, the children could remember 70% of the dental health messages associated with the show (Woolley, 1980).\\"Evaluation studies of the school programs revealed that after six months children were able to recall more than 70% of the dental health message. Results of a recent WHO survey of the oral health status of 13-14-year-olds in Canterbury (New Zealand), Sydney (Australia), Trondelag (Norway), Yamanashi (Japan) and Hannover (West Germany) showed that the Sydney children [who had seen Hetherington's show] had the lowest caries rate\\" (Woolley, 1980, p.254). In 1970, as part of a weekend workshop conducted by the Australian Dental Association and the Dental Health Education and Research Foundation at Sydney University, Hetherington demonstrated his work to the assembled dentists, by allowing them to observe him deliver an entire performance to a group of children from Newtown North Primary School. They were all greatly impressed with his work.A puppet (aged about 10) goes to university, The Sydney Morning Herald, (Tuesday, 18 August 1970), p.16. Smiley's Good Teeth Puppet Theatre operated from 1968 to 1985,Anon, (1970). and, although it began in suburban Sydney, it was making trips into the country by late 1969. As time passed, Hetherington became less involved in the actual delivery of the performances and often hired other puppeteers to perform the shows. For the four years his son Stephen studied at Sydney University (i.e., from 1977 to 1980), Stephen worked part-time on the show as a puppeteer and was, also, the person who spoke to the children before and after each show. The other puppeteer who teamed with Stephen was Pam Sahm, who operated Smiley.Pam was the wife of the Mosman potter, Bernard Sahm (see Pinson, P. & Warren, G., \\"Sahm, Bernard (1926‚Äì2011)\\", Obituaries Australia, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, 2011. Javanese Shadow Puppet Theatre Given his wide range of appropriate skills and experience, Hetherington was invited to work with a group of undergraduate students (ranging from second to fourth year) from the (then) Department of Indonesian and Malayan Studies at the University of Sydney, over the entire three-term year of 1980, in the task of preparing them for a performance of \\"Irawan Rabi\\", or \\"Irwan's Wedding\\", as it had been adapted for a western audience by James R. Brandon, in the manner of the traditional Javanese shadow puppet theatre (or wayang kulit). (Day, 1981). He was asked to assist them to acquire an understanding of shadow puppet design, train them in the appropriate techniques of puppet manipulation, guide them into a smooth performance, as well as transferring an understanding of puppetry stagecraft (Day, 1981). Apart from the extensive training he delivered to the students, and the advice that he gave to the entire company on puppetry stagecraft,As well as the students and Hetherington, the company included an academic, Anthony Day, an actress, Ludmilla Doneman, a director from the university‚Äôs Theatre Studies Workshop, Derek Nicholson, and a post-graduate student and accomplished performer of Javanese gamelan music, Jenny Lindsay (Day, 1981, p.17). he was also a very important participant in the joint construction of the final script, the musical improvisations used during the performance, and the comic routines that were woven throughout the entire performance.

The band formed in 1977 at Leeds University, where Burnham was studying English Literature. Before the band signed with EMI Records (UK, R.O.W.) and Warner Bros. Records (USA), he was a founding member of Impact Theatre Co-operative. Creem magazine's Dave DiMartino said in 1980 \\"Witness Hugo Burnham, a close-cropped, thickset out- and-out scary drummer who looks like his idea of fun might be pushing young American faces into old American brick walls.\\" He continued, \\"watching the Gang Of Four perform at Bookie's Club 870 and realizing that as great as the records are, the band in live performance is even better. There's rhythm, always rhythm, provided by Burnham's steady drums and Dave Allen's absolutely superb funk basswork\\". Rolling Stone critic Greil Marcus wrote, \\"Hugo Burnham play(s) in an economical and precise yet propulsive style, giving the rhythm a piston-like drive.\\" After leaving the band in 1983, Burnham joined Illustrated Man, then worked as an occasional session drummer with Wall of Voodoo's Stan Ridgway, ABC, PiL, Nikki Sudden, and Samantha Fox, before joining his former G4 bandmate Dave Allen with Shriekback, serving as the band's manager from 1985 until 1988, when he moved from London, UK to New York City, to open an office for his company Huge & Jolly Management and Outlaw Management. He then worked as an A&R; executive with Island Records in New York, Imago Records in New York and Los Angeles, Qwest Records in Los Angeles, and EMI Music Publishing in Los Angeles. He reunited briefly with Allen to play on The Call leader Michael Been's solo album On The Verge of a Nervous Breakthrough. After leaving EMI Music, he returned to management with Deathray (featuring former members of rock group Cake, Victor Damiani and Greg Brown), then left Los Angeles for Gloucester, Massachusetts, at the end of 1998, adding Little Red Rocket (see Azure Ray), and Boston rock group C60 (whose album he produced with engineer Matthew Ellard), to the Huge & Jolly Management roster. Gang of Four's original line-up reunited in 2005, with Burnham telling Rolling Stone \\"It would be folly to go out and try to foist new music on people... What resonates is the old stuff, and we need to go out and do that. After all, the crux of it is the four of us onstage playing, making loud rude noises and running around furiously.\\" He also told the New York Times' Jon Pareles, \\"I knew we could do it, when I saw we all still had our hair.\\" He spent 2005 and 2006 making those loud rude noises and won (with the band) Mojo magazine's \\" Inspiration to Music\\" and the U \\"LifeTime achievement in Music\\" awards. He last performed with the band in December 2006 at All Tomorrow's Parties at Minehead in England. Burnham along with Dave Allen left the band again in 2008, intending to focus on his studies and work as an academic. Burnham completed his master's degree in Education from Cambridge College in 2006. He was an associate professor at the New England Institute of Art in Boston from 2000 until 2015, when he became Dean of Student Affairs, before leaving the college in October, 2016.

Bolshaya Rossiyskaya Encyclopedia. . p. 238 They speak a sub-dialect of the Tatar language's middle dialect. Russian and Tatar historians usually treat the Naƒüayb√§ks as an integral part of Volga Tatars; a minority considers Naƒüayb√§ks a separate ethnicity in their own right. In the 1989 Russian census, 11,200 people identified themselves as Naƒüayb√§ks, falling to 9,600 in 2002.  Origin  The origins of the Naƒüayb√§ks are unclear. One theory places the Naƒüayb√§ks as an offshoot of the Nogais. Other accounts claim that they are Volga Tatars baptized after the fall of Kazan Khanate. The most plausible theory, according to the 1994 Russian encyclopedia, says that the ancestors of the Naƒüayb√§ks traditionally lived in central districts of the Khanate, east of Kazan, and most likely descended from Nogay and Kipchak people. In the 18th century, they also assimilated a small group of Christians from Iran and Central Asia.\\"62 male christians (Persians, Arabs, Bukharans, Karakalpaks)\\" - Tishkov, Iskhakov (1994), p. 238 The most popular theory in Tatarstan is that they were Serving Tatars from Kazan Khanate that were forcibly baptized by Ivan IV and relocated to the border between nomad Bashkirs, that were already incorporated to Russia and nomad Kazakhs as border keepers. Yet another theory says that the Naƒüayb√§ks were Tatarized Finno-Ugric peoples that kept the Kazan Khanate's borders. Demonym Naƒüayb√§k emerged in written sources only in the 19th century although a fringe theory asserts its existence as far as the 17th century. The village of Nagaybak, which gave name to present-day Nagaybaksky District, is known since the 1730s.  Historical record  Reliable historical evidence of Naƒüayb√§k people start with a 1729 record detailing 25 villages of \\"newly baptized [Tatars]\\" (Russian: –Ω–æ–≤–æ–∫—Ä–µ—â—ë–Ω—ã) in Ufa uezd, east of the Kama River. Most likely, they settled around Ufa in the second half of the 17th century after the completion of the defensive Kama Abatis Line (1652‚Äì1656). During the Tatar and Bashkir revolts of late 17th and early 18th century the Naƒüayb√§ks remained loyal to the Russian Empire. The government rewarded them with a wholesale transfer of the Naƒüayb√§ks into the Cossack estate, and assigned the Naƒüayb√§ks to the defense of Menzelinsk Fort. Another defensive fort was built in 1736 in the village of Nagaybak, 64 versts from Menzelinsk (present-day Bakalinsky District). The new fortress became the hub of the \\"newly baptized\\", and by 1744 the nearby Naƒüayb√§k population increased to 1359 people in eleven villages.One selo (larger village) and ten smaller villages, not counting Fort Nagaybak itself - Tishkov, Iskhakov (1994), p. 238 Two more Naƒüayb√§k villages were recorded in 1795. The original Naƒüayb√§k race was gradually diluted with an inflow of other Christianized Tatars recruited into cossack service (Yasak Tatars and Tipt√§rs). The government mandated their relocation into predominantly Christian Naƒüayb√§k lands to evade daily contact between Christian and Muslim Tatars, and the new settlers rapidly intermarried with the locals. In 1773, Nagaybak Fort was caught in the way of Yemelyan Pugachev's rebellion. Loyal cossacks and troops, headed by captain Rushinsky, fled to Menzelinsk; most of the remaining soldiers joined the rebellion and participated in the siege of Ufa. Pugachev installed a \\"newly baptized Persian\\" by the name of Tornov, as the ataman of Nagaybak. In January 1774, a small government company pushed the rebels out of Nagaybak Fort, but Tornov returned in strength and regained control over the fort. Two weeks later a whole corps of government troops crushed the rebellion. The fort became a base for punitive expeditions against the remains of Pugachev's army.R. V. Ovchinnikov, L. N. Bolshakov. Encyclopedia of Orenburg Oblast. Nagaybak Fortress (in Russian). Retrieved October 25, 2010 Naƒüayb√§k cavalry participated in the Napoleonic Wars and in the subsequent occupation of Paris. In 1842, the Naƒüayb√§k cossacks relocated from their former host in Nagaybak Fort eastward, to the former Orenburg Governorate. Here, they founded a chain of villages named after the battles of Napoleonic Wars, including present-day Parizh, named after the Battle of Paris in 1814, Fershampenuaz (after the Battle of F√®re-Champenoise), Kassel (after engagements near Kassel in Hesse), Trebiy (after the Battle of Trebbia) in 1799, etc. Fershampenuaz remains the center of Nagaybaksky District to present. Another group of the Naƒüayb√§k settled in present-day Orenburg Oblast. These Naƒüayb√§ks settled on traditionally Muslim territories, and by the beginning of the 20th century they converted back to Islam and were reassimilated into Tatar ethnos. Traditional Naƒüayb√§k female clothing is similar to that of the Ker√§≈üen Tatars, but male clothing contains many elements of the Cossack uniform.

Lewthwaite, the widow of 7/7 London terrorist bomber Germaine Lindsay, is accused of causing the deaths of more than 400 people. She is a fugitive from justice in Kenya, where she was wanted on charges of possession of explosives and conspiracy to commit a felony and is the subject of an Interpol Red Notice requesting her arrest with a view to extradition. Lewthwaite was an alleged member of the Somalia-based radical Islamic militant group Al-Shabaab. She was accused of orchestrating grenade attacks at non-Muslim places of worship, and is believed to have been behind an attack on those watching football in a bar in Mombasa during Euro 2012. In September 2013, there was speculation over her possible involvement in the Nairobi Westgate shopping mall attack, although other reports cast doubt on this, or said her role had been exaggerated. She was dubbed the \\"White Widow\\" by the news media, a play on words referencing her race and the death of her first husband and the practice of referring to Chechen female suicide bombers as \\"black widows\\". Early life Lewthwaite was born to parents Andrew and Elizabeth Christine (n√©e Allen) Lewthwaite in Banbridge, County Down in 1983. Her father is a former British Army soldier who served in the 9th/12th Royal Lancers and had met her mother while he was stationed in Northern Ireland in the 1970s. Following her birth the family lived for a short period in Northern Ireland, where her father worked as a lorry driver, before settling in Aylesbury, England. She attended Elmhurst middle school and The Grange secondary school in Aylesbury. She studied for a politics and religion degree at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, but dropped out. =Conversion to Islam= Lewthwaite's parents separated in 1994, and friends later reported that she was \\"badly affected by the break-up\\" and \\"sought solace from Muslim neighbours who she believed had a stronger family network.\\" Raised as a Christian, by the age of 17 she had converted to Islam. She adopted the Muslim name Sherafiyah at the time of her conversion. She arranged to meet Germaine Lindsay at a Stop the War march in Hyde Park, London; they subsequently married in Aylesbury on 30 October 2002, using the Islamic names Asmantara and Jamal. Lewthwaite's parents, who \\"never came to terms with their daughter's conversion\\", refused to attend the ceremony. =7/7 bomb attacks= Three years later, at 8:50 a.m. on 7 July 2005, Lindsay blew himself up on a train travelling between King's Cross and Russell Square tube stations. He killed 26 civilians in his suicide attack. Lewthwaite was eight months pregnant with their second child, a daughter, at the time of his death, and their first child, a son, was 14 months old. Lewthwaite reported her husband missing six days after the bombing by telephoning a helpline set up for families of the victims. She denied prior knowledge of the attacks and said: She was placed in protective custody in a police 'safe house' after her home was firebombed in the immediate aftermath of the bombings. At the inquest into the bombings, it was disclosed that Lewthwaite had associated with Mohammad Sidique Khan, the ringleader of the London bombers, before the attacks. =Newspaper controversy= In September 2005, Lewthwaite was widely criticised for selling her story, in which she portrayed herself as a victim and her husband as a \\"relatively recent [convert]\\" who had been \\"tricked into his actions by extremists\\", to tabloid newspaper The Sun for ¬£30,000. The Independent reported that Lewthwaite's account conflicted with evidence from Lindsay's sister that he had actually converted to Islam aged 15, and said that families of the victims were \\"unconvinced by her portrait of the bomber\\", while her \\"attempts to share the blame with others obscured the murder of innocent commuters\\". The Yorkshire Post said: \\"For very good and obvious reasons, there is a law against any criminal profiting from his illegal activities by selling his story to a newspaper. And while the letter of the law has not been broken on this occasionMs Lewthwaite is not a criminalits spirit has clearly been breached.\\" =Post-7/7= The Daily Telegraph reported in September 2013 that Lewthwaite was subsequently believed to have met and married Habib Saleh Ghani, who was born in Hounslow, London in 1985. Ghani, also known as Abu Usama al-Pakistani, first moved to Kenya in 2007, where his mother was born. His father emigrated to Britain from Pakistan. Ghani was a contemporary of Asif Mohammed Hanif at Hounslow Jamia Masjid and Islamic Centre. Hanif became Britain's first Islamic suicide bomber; he killed himself and three others at \\"Mike's Place\\", a bar in Tel Aviv, in April 2003, after being recruited by Hamas in Damascus, Syria. Lewthwaite gave birth to a third child in 2009, but the father was not named on the birth certificate. She is reported to have moved to the north of England, then later to have disappeared with her children, and was believed to be in hiding in Tanzania or Somalia. A later Telegraph report casts doubt on the marriage to Ghani. Quoting anti- terrorist police in Kenya, the newspaper said in October 2013 that there was \\"no romantic relationship between the two\\", but that they were linked through their \\"associates in the same cell in Mombasa, that was intending to set off bombs in December 2011\\". In May 2014, the Daily Mirror reported that Lewthwaite had married Hassan Maalim Ibrahim, a senior commander with the Al- Shabaab militant group. Alleged links to Al-ShabaabUse of fraudulent passport= In February 2012, anti-terrorist police in Nairobi, Kenya, issued an arrest warrant for a white woman using the false name of Natalie Webb. The white woman was known to have used a fraudulently obtained South African passport. After liaising with Scotland Yard, they said that the woman was known to be using at least three separate identities that included her true identity, Samantha Lewthwaite, and was accompanied by three children. The woman was wanted in connection with links to an Al-Shabaab terrorist cell planning attacks in Kenya in reprisal for anti-terrorism operations being conducted in Somalia. The photograph of the woman in the passport bore \\"a strong likeness to Samantha Lewthwaite.\\" The police said: \\"We believe she is not a small fish. She is among several Britons that our intelligence service is aware of in relation to terrorists' plans to attack us.\\" The woman had entered Kenya in November 2011 using the passport and then joined other members of the cell in Mombasa. The real Natalie Webb was discovered to be an English nurse living in the home counties who had been the victim of identity theft. A \\"large team\\" of detectives from SO15, the Metropolitan Police Service's Counter Terrorism Command, travelled to Nairobi to assist with the investigation and attempts were launched to locate Lewthwaite in Britain. The police initially said that they could not confirm that the woman was definitely Lewthwaite \\"unless and until she is captured\\" and said: \\"Samantha Lewthwaite is one of the names in our records. She had three children with her. She was connected to the terror group.\\" Lewthwaite's father said: \\"I cannot believe she would be involved in something like this and be there with the children. We have not had any contact with her for some time, I haven't spoken to her for a long time. I don't know if she's in this country or where she is. She has a lot of friends up north but she does not have much to do with us. I don't even know the name of her latest child.\\" Alfred Mutua, the Kenyan Government Spokesperson and Public Communications Secretary, said: \\"We believe she is a collaborator with terrorists. Our understanding is she was working with people here, al-Qaeda or al-Shabaab people. She is a very big sympathiser with those people. She was not going to carry out an attack, but she helped to fund-raise, helped in the acquisition of weapons, hiding people, transporting people, that kind of thing.\\" Examination of the recovered passport showed that the woman first entered Kenya from Tanzania on 26 February 2011, re-entered on 25 August 2011, and again on 21 November 2011. She was placed under surveillance by Kenyan police after moving into an apartment in Mombasa belonging to the former wife of terrorist financier Musa Hussein Abdi. Abdi had been killed along with Fazul Abdullah Mohammed, the leader of Al-Qaeda in East Africa, by Somali Armed Forces near Mogadishu, Somalia, in June 2011, and was believed to have been a key player in the funding of Al-Shabaab. =Links to Johannesburg= Following renewed publicity about Lewthwaite's activities in 2013, Naledi Pandor, the South African Minister of Home Affairs, issued a statement saying that the passport had been \\"fraudulently acquired\\" using birth registration documents in the name of Natalie Faye Webb, and had been issued by the passport agency in Durban. Pandor said that they had determined that Lewthwaite first entered South Africa in July 2008 and \\"travelled in and out of the country on several occasions\\". The passport had been cancelled and added to a \\"stop list\\" in 2011. Further investigations revealed that Lewthwaite, using the Natalie Webb identity, had worked as an IT specialist at a halal meat factory in Lenasia, Johannesburg, and had lived in rented properties in the Mayfair and Bromhof suburbs of Johannesburg. Credit records showed that Lewthwaite ran up a number of unpaid debts from bank loans, credit cards and clothing store charge accounts in South Africa, including R28,000 owed to First Rand Bank and R30,000 to Standard Bank. Lewthwaite gave birth to her fourth child, a daughter, at a private birthing centre in Johannesburg in July 2010. The Daily Telegraph reported that she registered with the clinic late into her pregnancy, and under the name Asmaa Shahidah Bint-Andrews. She gave birth after attending four prenatal appointments. Anti-terrorism investigators told the newspaper the child's father is believed to be Abdi Wahid, a former Kenyan naval officer who defected to al-Shabaab. =Arrest of Jermaine Grant= In December 2011, Kenyan police raided a property in Mombasa and arrested Jermaine Grant, also known as Ali Mohammed Ibrahim, a 29-year-old British Muslim convert of Jamaican origin from Newham, London. Grant, who was using a forged Canadian passport in the name of Peter Joseph, was charged with possession of bomb-making materials and preparing to commit a felony. In January 2012, police raided the apartment where the woman known as Natalie Webb was staying but she had already fled. The terror cell was believed to be planning attacks targeting hotels and tourists in Mombasa during Christmas 2011. When questioned by police Grant identified the woman as the leader of the cell and confirmed that she was Samantha Lewthwaite. Kenyan police revealed Grant was already known to them after being arrested in the Dadaab refugee camp in northern Kenya in 2008 while attempting to travel to Somalia disguised as a woman wearing a burqa. He and two other men, also wearing burqas, were allegedly travelling to meet an Al-Qaeda leader. Six hours after their arrest, a group of 20 Al-Shabaab fighters freed all three men after storming the Dadajbula police post where they were being held. One of the other two men is believed to have been Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, later killed by US Navy SEALs in Operation Celestial Balance, an attack against an Al-Qaeda training camp in Somalia in 2009. A woman who was with the group at the time of their arrest but not detained was subsequently identified by Kenyan police as Lewthwaite. =Confirmation of identity= In March 2012, it was disclosed that the CIA had joined the search for Lewthwaite along with Habib Saleh Ghani who had fled at the same time. The two were identified from photographs as having rented a property near to the exclusive Mombasa Serena Beach Hotel and Sarova Whitesands Beach Resort, which police suspected they planned to target. Ghani was using a forged Mozambique passport in the name of Marco Costa and told the landlord that Lewthwaite was his wife. A neighbour said: \\"We knew her as 'the white woman' who was very secretive. She went to the mosque a lot and would not let her children attend school.\\" When police searched the property they found a laptop computer, magazines for an AK-47 assault rifle, 100 rounds of ammunition, detonators and a photograph of Lewthwaite. Initial reports indicated that the computer had been smashed, and its hard drive removed, but later reports discussing the laptop's content appeared to contradict this. Police said: \\"We have no doubt that the woman we are looking for is Samantha Lewthwaite. This is a massive manhunt. We believe she is dangerous and have issued her photograph to all border posts.\\" Fingerprint evidence recovered in Mombasa was sent to Scotland Yard and confirmed to be a match with those of Samantha Lewthwaite. Kenyan police said: \\"Samantha Lewthwaite's fingerprints have been confirmed by detectives we have been working with from the UK... We are confident we are looking for the White Widow.\\" The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office warned: \\"We believe that terrorists may be in the final stages of planning attacks. Attacks could be indiscriminate and target Kenyan institutions as well as places where expatriates and foreign travellers gather, such as hotels, shopping centres and beaches.\\" Ghani was reportedly killed in al-Baate, southern Somalia, in September 2013 following an internal feud within the organisation. Ghani and American jihadist Abu Mansoor Al- Amriki were shot dead by Al-Shabaab fighters who had been tracking down and killing allies and supporters of Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys, who split from Al- Shabaab in June 2013. Al-Amriki was on the FBI's Most Wanted Terrorists list with a $5million bounty offered for information leading to his capture. The killings were allegedly ordered by Al-Shabaab's chief, Moktar Ali Zubeyr. In October 2013, reports emerged concerning the content of a laptop and flash drive used by Lewthwaite, and subsequently recovered from Mombasa by Kenyan police. A Sky News investigation suggested she had used the computer to research information about bomb-making, as well as hair and beauty tips. Among the 2,000 files on the hardware was a downloaded document titled The Mujahideen Explosives Handbook, and Ode to Bin Laden, a poem allegedly written by Lewthwaite which pays tribute to the founder of al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden. =Arrest warrant= On 4 January 2012, Kenyan authorities issued an arrest warrant for Lewthwaite to answer charges of possessing bomb-making material and conspiring to make an explosive device with the intent to harm others. The charges were not made public until May 2012, when Jacob Ondari, Kenya's assistant director of public prosecutions, announced: \\"Samantha Lewthwaite was charged in absentia and a warrant of arrest issued against her.\\" Kenyan police revealed that when Grant was arrested in December 2011, the group was only days away from committing an attack. The target was either \\"a hotel in Mombasa or a shopping mall in Nairobi.\\" Grant was also alleged to have voluntarily given up the identity of Lewthwaite, telling police officers: \\"There is someone much bigger you really want; she is the financier.\\" In March 2012, following a request from the Kenyan authorities, Interpol issued an international alert requesting the arrest and extradition of Lewthwaite. In April 2019 Grant was convicted of possession of bomb-making materials, but acquitted of conspiracy to commit a terrorist act. =Mombasa grenade attack= In July 2012, she was named as one of the suspects involved in a 24 June 2012 grenade attack on the Jericho bar in Mombasa. The attack took place during a Euro 2012 football match between England and Italy. Kenyan police said a woman matching Lewthwaite's description was seen near the bar shortly before the attack in which three people were killed and 25 injured. Police said: \\"We suspect Samantha Lewthwaite was actively involved in the terrorist attack on the club.\\" =Westgate shopping mall attack= Lewthwaite's name was linked with the September 2013 attack claimed by Al-Shabaab on the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi, which left 71 dead and approximately 200 injured. Despite intense media speculation, these reports were viewed with caution by UK government officials, and there was no confirmation of Lewthwaite's involvement as an attacker, organiser or fundraiser. Al-Shabaab itself claimed no women played a role in the attack. In a Twitter post the group said, \\"We have an adequate number of young men who are fully committed and we do not employ our sisters in such military operations.\\" On 5 October, Kenyan authorities named four people believed to have participated in the attack, all of whom they said were killed in the ensuing standoff with the country's military forces. Police chief David Kimaiyo also confirmed that Lewthwaite was not among those involved in the incident. =Alleged presence in Lamu= In June 2014, the BBC reported that well-placed security sources indicated that they had reliable information that Lewthwaite was in Kenya, and that they had launched a large operation to find her. According to reports, an unknown woman, who was believed to be Lewthwaite, was escorted by armed Kenyan police officers in the coastal town of Lamu, with the apparent intention of visiting a Kenyan army base in Somalia. The woman then allegedly disappeared after immigration officials denied her entry into the country. However, Lamu Police Commander Leonard Omollo denied the allegations, indicating that the woman in question had been identified as a Spanish tourist who had since returned home.

He was the son of Edward Lingen and Blanche Bodenham. He fathered 2 sons, Henry and William and 7 daughters, Elizabeth, Joan, Blanch, Mary (Dobbyns), Cecilia, Frances (Unett), and Alice (Herring). Both sons died without issue but the daughters left considerable posterity. Ancestry The Lingen family had long been settled in that county and are recorded in early documents including Doomsday Book. The manor of Lingen was settled on Turstan de Lingen and his wife Agnes, heiress and daughter of Alfred of Marlborough, Baron of Ewyas with his extensive Doomsday landholding. Turstan's and Agnes's descendants included Isolde de Lingen who married Brian Harley, ancestor or the Harley Earls of Oxford and Dukes of Portland and Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother. Another descendant and sister of Isolde was Isabella de Lingen, Lady Pembruggue of Tong Castle, founderess of the Chantry Church and buried at Tong, ancestor of the Ludlows of Stokesay Castle, Vernons of Hadden Hall and the Manners, Dukes of Rutland. Another descendant was Sir John Lingen of Lingen d 1506, who fought at the Battle of Mortimer's Cross which elevated Edward IV as king and the family's arms were amended with the three white roses of York. Sir John married Elisabeth de Burgh (d. 1522) who was a co-heiress of Sir John de Burgh and thus descended from the native Welsh Princes of Powys and Llewellyn the Great, Prince of Wales. Elisabeth also shared common descent with the Royal House of Tudor with a grandmother being a sister of Margaret ferch Thomas who married Fychan Tudor and was grandmother of Henry VII, and another of these sisters Ellen ferch Thomas being the mother of Owain Glynd≈µr \\"Prince of Wales\\". Both Elisabeth and Sir John are buried in Aymestrey church near Lingen with in the chancel. Their descendants included Sir Henry Lingen, Sir Ralph Robert Wheeler Lingen the 1st Baron Lingen of Lingen, the Lingen's of Stoke Edith, Andrew Lingen-Stallard Esq, a former Council member of Royal College of Midwives and the present senior line of the Burton-Lingen's of Longner Hall near Shrewsbury, in which any co rights of the former Principality of Powys now rest. Early career He was High Sheriff of Herefordshire in 1638, and made much money from collecting taxes and rent. The English Civil War During the Civil War he was again appointed High Sheriff of the county in 1643 and commanded Goodrich Castle, defending it against the Parliamentarians until July 1646 when Colonel John Birch finally broke the defences using the famous cannon Roaring Meg. His house of Freen's Court at Sutton was besieged until Prince Rupert of the Rhine was called to the rescue. Lingen was knighted by Charles I on his visit to Hereford in 1645. He himself in turn besieged Brampton Bryan Castle, home of his distant kinsman Robert Harley (1579-1656) (quite a common occurrence during the Civil War), the Harley family were later holders of the title Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer. This siege was defended by Lady Brilliana Harley but to no avail. In 1646 he defended Goodrich Castle but the castle's defences were breached and he was allowed to leave and the castle slighted. He attempted to rally the citizens of Hereford to rebel against the parliamentary forces with out success. A portrait of Sir Henry and his wife is in the Old House in Butcher Row in the centre of the city of Hereford. Aftermath of war After the Civil War, Sir Henry retired to Stoke Edith \\"The Fairer House of the Lingens\\" near Hereford but was fined heavily by Parliament of the sum of six thousand pounds for supporting the former King. Later, his heirs sold Stoke Edith, his principal estate to the Foley family in 1670, it becoming the principal house of Paul Foley, later Speaker of the House of Commons, who rebuilt the house from 1695.Roy Peaccock, The Seventeenth Century Foleys: iron wealth and vision 1580‚Äì1716 (Black Country Society, 2011), 131‚Äì2 154‚Äì5. Marriage Sir Henry married Alice Pye of the Mynnd. (Both were later interred in the Church at Stoke Edith but during remodelling of the Church their monuments were lost). With the Restoration he became a member of parliament for Herefordshire but died of smallpox in Gloucester on his way back from a sitting in London in 1662. Posterity His male heirs died with no issue. Other family lines exist, including heirs of his daughters. Other Lingen lines exist which descend from Sir John Lingen and Elisabeth de Burgh are represented by the Burton-Lingens of Longner Hall in Shropshire who are now the senior branch of the family, Ralph Lingen, 1st Baron Lingen (a title now extinct), Permanent Secretary to the Treasury d 1905 and buried in Brompton cemetery in London.

He studied philosophy, sinology and history in Heidelberg, but did not finish his studies. Political careerEarly beginnings= B√ºtikofer was active in the student's movement and one of the \\"K groups\\", the Maoist Communist League of West Germany (Kommunistischer Bund Westdeutschland; KBW). From the 1980s onwards, he became active in Heidelberg municipal politics for the Green-Alternative List. In 1984, he was elected into the town council of Heidelberg and became a member of the Green Party, the starting point of his political career with Alliance 90/The Greens. In 1988, he was elected in the Landtag of Baden-W√ºrttemberg. He was Member of the Landtag until 1996. After a year of parental leave, in 1997 B√ºtikofer became co-chairman of the Green Party in Baden-W√ºrttemberg. Two years later he was elected secretary general of the federal party.

Political viewsOn the Green Party and the German political system= In 2005, B√ºtikofer complained that because Germany has no winner-take-all political system, there were only few Green party members in the foreign service, even after Joschka Fischer had been foreign minister for seven years; by contrast, hundreds of supporters of the Christian Democratic Union served in the Federal Foreign Office.Richard Bernstein (April 29, 2005), Europa: German 'second front' against Joschka Fischer International Herald Tribune. In 2010, B√ºtikofer characterized his party as representing ‚Äúa certain lifestyle,‚Äù noting that, mostly urbanized, many belong to the professions and are politically and socially engaged. ‚ÄúThey sit on school boards.

It was founded in 1969 by guitarist Jukka Tolonen and drummer Vesa Aaltonen. Other founder members were M√•ns Groundstroem (bass) and Frank Robson (vocals), previously of Blues Section. Juhani Aaltonen (saxophone/flute) had earlier played in Soulset; he was replaced in 1970 by Pekka P√∂yry. Eero Raittinen replaced Robson as a vocalist in 1972, the same year as the album Lambertland was released in UK. The album was a tight fusion of jazz and folk rock with highly inventive and imaginative lyrics which charted at the number 7 position in Finland. Milky Way Moses reached number 12 in Finland in 1974. The band toured in continental Europe and the United Kingdom in 1973 and 1974, but P√∂yry, stricken with bouts of manic depression, was occasionally replaced with keyboardist Esa Kotilainen on live dates. Tasavallan Presidentti disbanded in 1974, then reunited from 2005-06 with original saxophonist Juhani Aaltonen, as P√∂yry had committed suicide in 1980.

Written by Steven S. DeKnight and Drew Goddard and directed by David Greenwalt, it was originally broadcast on May 5, 2004 on the WB network. When Angel and Spike go to Italy after hearing Buffy is in trouble, they discover she is dating their long-time nemesis The Immortal. While searching for Buffy - and the head of a demon which must be brought back to L.A. to prevent a demon war - they reminisce about their history with The Immortal and finally accept that they can't control whom Buffy dates. Plot Gunn discovers a demon gang war is imminent, unless the head of the leaders is recaptured from Rome, so Angel and Spike travel to Rome to retrieve the head. They find out that Buffy is dating their nemesis \\"The Immortal\\". Flashbacks are shown that explain why Angel and Spike hate \\"The Immortal\\": he slept with Darla and Drusilla simultaneously while his minions held Angelus and Spike in chains. They discuss the matter and conclude that Buffy must be under some sort of love spell. Spike and Angel visit Buffy's apartment and find Andrew Wells. He said that he lives with Buffy and Dawn, and Buffy went to a club with The Immortal. They go to the club and see Buffy from a distance. They get distracted and leave the demon head in a bag on a table, which is snatched by The Immortal's demon butler. Angel and Spike fight the minions and \\"accidentally\\" hit each other a few times, too. The demon butler gets away with the head and mocks the heroes as he leaves. Angel and Spike argue over how \\"if they had their resources\\", that they would be able to find the head. Spike points out that there is a Wolfram & Hart office in Rome. Meanwhile, at Wolfram & Hart in L.A., Fred's parents show up and Wesley ushers them into his office to tell them she has been consumed. He is about to tell them when Illyria walks in the door looking and acting exactly like Fred. Later, while her parents are being shown Fred's office, Wesley confronts Illyria. She explains because of Fred's past memories she cannot bear to witness their grief in addition to Wesley's, which she experiences as a physical pain. She explains that she can appear in the form that she wishes. After Fred's parents leave, Wesley asks her if she got what she wanted from that experience. Illyria answers \\"Yes\\", and Wesley orders her never to do it again. Angel and Spike go the Rome Wolfram & Hart offices, where they are greeted by the CEO, an ebullient Italian woman. She says the head is being held in a standard ransom situation. Angel and Spike are given money for the drop, which they exchange with the butler for the bag. They open it and in it is actually a bomb, three seconds from detonation. While the explosion isn't shown, Spike and Angel both easily survive, albeit with their clothing heavily damaged and the street destroyed. Spike complains about his ruined jacket that he took from the dead Slayer Nikki Wood. They go back to the Rome Wolfram & Hart - the CEO laughs, saying they always do that (bomb) to first-timers. She replaces their damaged clothing, including Spike's 'irreplaceable' jacket. After being locked out of her office, Spike and Angel declare their intentions to go home, but return to Buffy's apartment and Andrew tells them to let her move on, that \\"people change,\\" while he leaves the apartment with two sexy women. Frustrated by their inability to contact Buffy and by the demon butler's chicanery on The Immortal's behalf, they decide to go home. Illyria follows Wesley into his office, still appearing and speaking as Fred. She states that she wishes to explore the relationship further and does not understand why Wesley is angry when he obviously loved Fred. He replies that she is not Fred and that he is sickened by the sight of her. He tells her to be anything as long as it's not Fred. She appears somewhat confused and when he leaves the room changes back into her usual form. \\"As you wish\\" she says. When Angel and Spike return home, they find the head on Angel's desk with a note signed by The Immortal. They are outraged; this is the second time he \\"distracted\\" them while he put the moves on \\"their\\" girl. They do, however, vehemently insist to each other that they are both now going to move on. Acting Carole Davis, who plays Ilona Costa Bianchi, the CEO of the Roman offices of Wolfram & Hart, plays a similar flamboyant Southern Italian role in Sex and the City as Amalita Amalfi. Production details This episode was the first time James Marsters met director David Greenwalt, despite working on the second season of Buffy together. \\"I was just a guest star, and I had no reason to go up to the writers' offices. I didn't go to the gods at that point,\\" says Marsters. He says that Greenwalt is \\"exceptional\\" at inspiring actors to perform their best. Actress Julie Benz says her last appearance as Darla in the flashback scenes of this episode was \\"a great way for us to... say goodbye to our characters, to be together and to have some fun.\\" She was relieved to shoot such a \\"playful\\" scene, \\"because anything else I think would have been too hard; too difficult; too painful.\\" She adds the sheet she was wrapped in kept snagging on the camera dolly and falling down. \\"It was a great way to end; flashing everybody!\\" she says. Dawn Summers was intended to appear in this episode, but as Michelle Trachtenberg was unavailable for filming, the role of Dawn was rewritten for Andrew Wells. =Writing= It is a commonly held but mistaken belief that the producers sought Sarah Michelle Gellar for this episode. Another actress played Buffy Summers in a faraway shot of her dancing with The Immortal in a nightclub. In fact, the intention of this episode was always that neither Buffy nor the Immortal would be clearly seen. Gellar was actually sought for the penultimate episode \\"Power Play\\", but proved unavailable because she was busy finishing the filming of The Grudge. Writer David Fury explains this in an interview with Mike Jozic: David Greenwalt refers to this episode as \\"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern go to Rome.\\" =Continuity= *The canonical eighth season comic retcons the identity of the Immortal's blonde consort; Buffy (as narrator) says: \\"The guys figured I was a target. Set up two other Slayers to be me. ... One's in Rome, partying very publicly - and supposedly dating some guy called 'The Immortal.' That part was Andrew's idea. He did research on the guy, said it would be hilarious for some reason\\" -- apparently the reason being a prank aimed at Spike and Angel.Darkhorse.com - Buffy Comic Preview *This episode makes reference to Buffy's speech to Angel in \\"Chosen\\". Of course, this is not explicitly explained, leaving Spike immensely confused by Angel's seemingly random statement. > Angel: But she's not finished baking yet. I gotta wait till she's done > baking, you know, till she finds herself, 'cause that's the drill. Fine. I'm > waitin' patiently, and meanwhile, The Immortal's eatin' cookie dough! *Although Angel and Spike have a particularly acrimonious relationship where Buffy is concerned, this adventure (and Buffy having moved on from them both) provides them with somewhat of a bonding experience - they drink together, engage in their most civil dialogue to date, and reminisce about the past. It is also relevant that Andrew, when sending the vampires, mentions that Buffy does love both of them. In the last episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Buffy had told Spike that she loved him, and he had told her \\"No you don't, but thanks for saying it.\\" *Spike complains about the duster he'd 'ripped off a dead slayer' (Nikki Wood, Slayer from the 1970s and mother of Robin Wood, who appears in the final season of Buffy). Clips of the encounter range through the seasons, most notably 'Lies My Parents Told Me' (Season 7) *This is perhaps the only episode when Angelus is portrayed as anything but a manipulative sociopath, joining Spike as being the target of many comical misfortunes, ranging from their mutual disbelief that Darla and Drusilla had been seduced \\"concurrently\\" by the Immortal to suffering the indignity of being denied entrance to one of the Immortal's parties while seeking a 'Blood Vengeance.' * Along with \\"Becoming, Part One\\", \\"Fool for Love\\" and \\"Darla\\", this is one of only four Buffyverse episodes in which all four members of the Whirlwind (Angel, Spike, Darla and Drusilla) appear. During their argument over which of them has helped save the world more times, Angel and Spike refer to the events of \\"Prophecy Girl\\" and \\"The Zeppo\\" (in which Angel helped to close the Hellmouth), \\"Doomed\\" and \\"Chosen\\" (in which Spike did so), \\"Graduation Day, Part Two\\" (in which Angel helped to defeat the Mayor), \\"Peace Out\\" (in which Angel Investigations defeated Jasmine) and \\"Becoming, Part Two\\" (in which Spike conspired with Buffy Summers so that she could kill Angelus before he could awaken the demon Acathla). =Cultural references= *The brief scene in black-and-white of Spike and Drusilla in an Italian jazz club resembles the style of Italian modernist films from the early 1960s by the likes of Fellini and Antonioni. *Andrew is seen wearing a Strong Bad t-shirt from the popular internet website Homestar Runner. *Upon finding out that Buffy is dating The Immortal, Spike declares \\"It's Worse!\\", in classic Star Wars style.

It lies on the River Leven about 5 miles (8 km) northeast of Ulverston in Furness in the county of Cumbria. History Remains of Backbarrow ironworks Backbarrow probably grew during the Elizabethan period, due to the corn mills that were built along the river. Earlier mills at the site had been owned by Furness Abbey, which by this time had been dissolved. Development increased due to the iron furnace that was built in Backbarrow in 1711.Harrison Ainsliehttp://www.28dayslater.co.uk/backbarrow-ironworks-cumbria- aug-2013.t83650 The furnace has been described as the first efficient blast furnace. The cotton mills continued to grow in size during the Victorian period. In 1868 an extension of the Furness Railway was built through the village to transport iron and products from the mills. Though the line was closed in the 1960s with the demise of the ironworks, the section from Haverthwaite to Lakeside, which passes through Backbarrow, remains open as a heritage railway (see Lakeside and Haverthwaite Railway). Backbarrow was particularly associated with the production of the blue pigment ultramarine, or \\"dolly blue\\". The ultramarine factory was established in an old mill building by the Lancashire Ultramarine Company, then purchased by Reckitt & Sons in 1928. The 'blue mill' was well-known locally, as dust from its production gave a blue tint to most of the village. Production of this continued until 1981. The factory site, which was known locally as \\"the bluemills\\", now accommodates a popular hotel and two blocks of apartments. A display of machinery used in the old factory is maintained by the hotel's proprietors while the old furnace, believed to be the only remaining example of its type, has been declared a Scheduled Ancient Monument and preserved as part of the Ironworks Apartments development. Backbarrow was hit by the nationwide floods of November 2009, as the River Leven overflowed causing severe damage to the bridge's walls and both parts of the Whitewater Hotel, as well as the Swan Hotel in Newby Bridge, 1.3 miles further up the river.http://www.thewestmorlandgazette.co.uk/news/4751700.Cumbria_flooding__Backbarrow_hotels_flooded/?ref=rss In 2010 the Lakeland Motor Museum relocated from Holker Hall to the former site of the Reckitt's Blue Dye Works carton packaging sheds in Backbarrow. Today, the site of the former Geography and environment The growth of the National Park led to an increase in tourism in the region. In particular, Backbarrow has great views of the turbulent nature of the River Leven, just south of Windermere. The river has also been used to develop a small hydro- electric plant, installed in 2000, generating electricity for the National Grid.

Born in Szombathely, We√∂res was brought up in the nearby village of Cs√∂nge. His first poems appeared when he was fourteen, being published in the influential journal Nyugat (\\"West\\") through the acceptance of its editor, the poet Mih√°ly Babits. We√∂res attended the University of P√©cs, studying law first before moving on to geography and history. He ultimately received a doctorate in philosophy and aesthetics. His doctoral dissertation The Birth of the Poem was published in 1939. It was in 1937 that he made the first of his travels abroad, going first to Manila for a Eucharistic Congress and then visiting Vietnam and India. During World War II We√∂res was drafted for compulsory labor, but was not sent to the front. After the end of the war, he returned to Cs√∂nge and briefly lived as a farmer. In 1948 We√∂res again travelled abroad, residing in Italy until 1949. In 1951 he settled in Budapest where he would reside for the rest of his life. The imposition of Stalinism in Hungary after 1948 silenced We√∂res and until 1964 little could be published.  Work  We√∂res' translations into Hungarian were wide and varied, including the works of Ukrainian national poet Taras Shevchenko, the Georgian poet Rustaveli, the Slovenian poets Oton ≈Ωupanƒçiƒç and Josip Murn Aleksandrov. He translated Indian poet Jai dev's poetry Gita Govinda from Sanskrit. He also translated Shakespeare's Venus and Adonis and Henry VIII, T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land, the nonsense poems by Edward Lear and Lewis Carroll, the complete poetry of St√©phane Mallarm√©,. His translation of the Tao Te Ching continues to be the most widely read in Hungary.  Legacy  Many of We√∂res' poems have been set to music. Zolt√°n Kod√°ly composed a choral piece to the text of the 14-year-old poet's poem √ñregek (Old People). Gy√∂rgy Ligeti, a friend of the poet, set several poems from Rongysz≈ënyeg and other books in the composition S√≠ppal, dobbal, n√°diheged√ºvel. Composer Peter E√∂tv√∂s has composed two pieces, Atlantis and Ima with texts from We√∂res' poem N√©ma zene (\\"Silent Music\\"), and in 2013 he composed Speaking Drums (Four Poems for Percussion Solo and Orchestra) based on the poems by S√°ndor We√∂res.

The English landscape garden, also called English landscape park or simply the English garden (, , , , ), is a style of \\"landscape\\" garden which emerged in England in the early 18th century, and spread across Europe, replacing the more formal, symmetrical jardin √† la fran√ßaise of the 17th century as the principal gardening style of Europe.Yves-Marie Allain and Janine Christiany, L'Art des jardins en Europe, Citadelles and Mazenod, Paris, 2006. The English garden presented an idealized view of nature. Created and pioneered by William Kent, the ‚Äúinformal‚Äù garden style originated as a revolt against the architectural garden and drew inspiration from paintings of landscapes by Claude Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin. The English garden usually included a lake, sweeps of gently rolling lawns set against groves of trees, and recreations of classical temples, Gothic ruins, bridges, and other picturesque architecture, designed to recreate an idyllic pastoral landscape. The work of Lancelot \\"Capability\\" Brown was particularly influential. By the end of the 18th century the English garden was being imitated by the French landscape garden, and as far away as St. Petersburg, Russia, in Pavlovsk, the gardens of the future Emperor Paul. It also had a major influence on the form of the public parks and gardens which appeared around the world in the 19th century.Lucia Impelluso, Jardins, potagers et labyrinthes, Mondatori Electra, Milan The English landscape garden was centred on the English country house. History Castle Howard (1699‚Äì1712), a predecessor of the English garden modelled on the gardens of Versailles The predecessors of the landscape garden in England were the great parks created by Sir John Vanbrugh (1664‚Äì1726) and Nicholas Hawksmoor at Castle Howard (1699‚Äì1712), Blenheim Palace (1705‚Äì1722), and the Claremont Landscape Garden at Claremont House (1715‚Äì1727). These parks featured vast lawns, woods, and pieces of architecture, such as the classical mausoleum designed by Hawksmoor at Castle Howard. At the center of the composition was the house, behind which were formal and symmetrical gardens in the style of the garden √† la fran√ßaise, with ornate carpets of floral designs and walls of hedges, decorated with statues and fountains. These gardens, modelled after the gardens of Versailles, were designed to impress visitors with their size and grandeur.Philippe Prevot, Histoire des jardins, Editions Sud Ouest, 2006 The royal gardens at the private residence of Charles, Prince of Wales, Highgrove House, have been open to the public for 25 years. The gardens of the late 18th century home were overgrown and untended when Charles first moved in but have since flourished and now include rare trees, flowers and heirloom seeds. Current organic gardening techniques have allowed the gardens to serve also as a sustainable habitat for birds and wildlife. The gardens were designed by Charles in consultation with highly regarded gardeners like Rosemary Verey and noted naturalist Miriam Rothschild. =William Kent and Charles Bridgeman= The new style that became known as the English garden was invented by landscape designers William Kent and Charles Bridgeman, working for wealthy patrons, including Richard Temple, 1st Viscount Cobham, Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington, and banker Henry Hoare; men who had large country estates, were members of the anti-royalist Whig Party, had classical educations, were patrons of the arts, and had taken the Grand Tour to Italy, where they had seen the Roman ruins and Italian landscapes they reproduced in their gardens. William Kent (1685‚Äì1748) was an architect, painter and furniture designer who introduced Palladian style architecture to England. Kent's inspiration came from Palladio's buildings in the Veneto and the landscapes and ruins around Rome‚Äîhe lived in Italy from 1709 to 1719, and brought back many drawings of antique architecture and landscapes. His gardens were designed to complement the Palladian architecture of the houses he built.See Allain and Christiany, pg. 280. Charles Bridgeman (1690‚Äì1738) was the son of a gardener and an experienced horticulturist, who became the Royal Gardener for Queen Anne and Prince George of Denmark, responsible for tending and redesigning the royal gardens at Windsor, Kensington Palace, Hampton Court, St. James's Park and Hyde Park. He collaborated with Kent on several major gardens, providing the botanical expertise which allowed Kent to realize his architectural visions. Ionic Temple at Chiswick House =Chiswick House= Kent created one of the first true English landscape gardens at Chiswick House for Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington. The first gardens that he laid out between 1724 and 1733 had many formal elements of a garden √† la fran√ßaise, including alleys forming a patte d'oie and canals, but they also featured a folly, a picturesque recreation of an Ionic temple set in a theatre of trees. Between 1733 and 1736, he redesigned the garden, adding lawns sloping down to the edge of the river and a small cascade. For the first time the form of a garden was inspired not by architecture, but by an idealized version of nature.Lucia Impelloso, Jardins, potagers et labyrinthes, pg. 90. =Rousham= Garden of Rousham House Rousham House in Oxfordshire is considered by some as the most accomplished and significant of William Kent's work.See John Dixon Hunt, Garden and Grove, London 1986. The patron was General Dormer, who commissioned Bridgeman to begin the garden in 1727, then brought in Kent to recreate it in 1737. Bridgeman had built a series of garden features including a grotto of Venus on the slope along the river Cherwell, connected by straight alleys. Kent turned the alleys into winding paths, built a gently turning stream, used the natural landscape features and slopes, and created a series of views and tableaux decorated with allegorical statues of Apollo, a wounded gladiator, a lion attacking a horse, and other subjects. He placed eyecatchers, pieces of classical architecture, to decorate the landscape, and made use of the ha-ha, a concealed ditch that kept grazing animals out of the garden while giving an uninterrupted vista from within. Finally, he added cascades modelled on those of the garden of Aldobrandini and Pratolino in Italy, to add movement and drama.Allain and Christiany, pg. 290 =Stowe House= Stowe (1730‚Äì38) The Palladian bridge and Pantheon at Stourhead Stowe, in Buckinghamshire, (1730‚Äì1738), was an even more radical departure from the formal French garden. In the early 18th century, Richard Temple, 1st Viscount Cobham, had commissioned Charles Bridgeman to design a formal garden, with architectural decorations by John Vanbrugh. Bridgeman's design included an octagonal lake and a rotunda (1720‚Äì21) designed by Vanbrugh. In the 1730s, William Kent and James Gibbs were appointed to work with Bridgeman, who died in 1738. Kent remade the lake in a more natural shape, and created a new kind of garden, which took visitors on a tour of picturesque landscapes. It eventually included a Palladian bridge (1738); a Temple of Venus (1731) in the form of a Palladian villa; a Temple of Ancient Virtues (1737), with statues of famous Greeks and Romans; a Temple of British Worthies (1734‚Äì1735), with statues of British heroes; and a Temple of Modern Virtues, which was deliberately left in ruins, which contained a headless statue of Robert Walpole, Cobham's political rival.Lucia Impelluso, Jardins, potagers et labyrinthes, pg. 96. The garden attracted visitors from all over Europe, including Jean-Jacques Rousseau. It became the inspiration for landscape gardens in Britain and on the Continent. =Stourhead= Stourhead, in Wiltshire (1741‚Äì80), created by banker Henry Hoare, was one of the first 'picturesque' gardens, inspired to resemble the paintings of Claude Lorrain. Hoare had travelled to Italy on the Grand Tour and had returned with a painting by Claude Lorrain. Hoare dammed a stream on his estate, created a lake, and surrounded the lake with landscapes and architectural constructions representing the different steps of the journey of Aeneas in the Aeneid by Virgil.Impelluso, Jardins, potagers et labyrinthes, pg. 95. The great age of the English gardenCapability Brown= Lancelot \\"Capability\\" Brown The most influential figure in the later development of the English landscape garden was Lancelot \\"Capability\\" Brown (1716‚Äì1783), who began his career in 1740 as a gardener at Stowe under Charles Bridgeman, then succeeded William Kent in 1748. Brown's contribution was to simplify the garden by eliminating geometric structures, alleys, and parterres near the house and replacing them with rolling lawns and extensive views out to isolated groups of trees, making the landscape seem even larger. \\"He sought to create an ideal landscape out of the English countryside.\\"Allain and Christiany, pg. 282. He created artificial lakes and used dams and canals to transform streams or springs into the illusion that a river flowed through the garden. He compared his own role as a garden designer to that of a poet or composer. \\"Here I put a comma, there, when it's necessary to cut the view, I put a parenthesis; there I end it with a period and start on another theme.\\"Cited in Allain and Christiany, pg. 282. Brown designed 170 gardens. The most important were: * Petworth (West Sussex) in 1752; * Chatsworth (Derbyshire) in 1761; * Bowood (Wiltshire) in 1763; * Blenheim Palace (Oxfordshire) in 1764. =Humphry Repton= Site at Wentworth, South Yorkshire before proposed landscaping Site at Wentworth, South Yorkshire after proposed landscaping Humphry Repton (21 April 1752 ‚Äì 24 March 1818) was the last great English landscape designer of the eighteenth century, often regarded as the successor to Capability Brown.Patrick Goode Ed. (2009) The Oxford Companion to Architecture, Oxford University Press Repton hit upon the idea of becoming a \\"landscape gardener\\" (a term he himself coined) after failing at various ventures and, sensing an opportunity after Brown's death, was ambitious to fill the gap and sent circulars round his contacts in the upper classes advertising his services. To help clients visualize his designs, Repton produced 'Red Books' (so called for their binding)Patrick Taylor Ed. (2006) The Oxford Companion to the Garden, Oxford University Press with explanatory text and watercolors with a system of overlays to show 'before' and 'after' views.John Cannon (2009) The Oxford Companion to British History, Oxford University Press In 1794 Richard Payne Knight and Uvedale Price simultaneously published vicious attacks on the 'meagre genius of the bare and bald', criticizing Brown's smooth, serpentine curves as bland and unnatural and championing rugged and intricate designs, composed according to 'picturesque theory' that designed landscapes should be composed like landscape paintings, with a foreground, a middle ground and a background. Early in his career, Repton defended Brown's reputation during the 'picturesque controversy'. However, as his career progressed Repton came to apply picturesque theory to the practice of landscape design. He believed that the foreground should be the realm of art (with formal geometry and ornamental planting), that the middle ground should have a parkland character of the type created by Brown and that the background should have a wild and 'natural' character. Repton re-introduced formal terraces, balustrades, trellis work and flower gardens around the house in a way that became common practice in the nineteenth century.James Stevens Curl (2006) A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture,Oxford University Press Repton published four major books on garden design: Sketches and Hints on Landscape Gardening (1795), Observations on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening (1803), An Inquiry into the Changes of Taste in Landscape Gardening (1806) and Fragments on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening (1816). These drew on material and techniques used in the Red Books. These works greatly influenced other landscape-designers including John Claudius Loudon, John Nash, Jean- Charles Adolphe Alphand, Hermann Ludwig Heinrich P√ºckler-Muskau and Frederick Law Olmsted. The Anglo-Chinese garden The Kew Gardens Pagoda at Kew, west London (1761) The Far East inspired the origins of the English Garden via Holland. In 1685, the English diplomat in The Hague and writer Sir William Temple wrote an essay Upon the garden of Epicurus (published in 1690), which contrasted European theories of symmetrical gardens with asymmetrical compositions from China, for which he introduced the Japanese term sharawadgi.See Wybe Kuitert \\"Japanese Art, Aesthetics, and a European discourse - unraveling Sharawadgi\\" Japan Review 2014 ISSN 0915-0986 (Vol.27) Temple had never visited the Far East, but he was in contact with the Dutch and their discourse on irregularity in design, had spoken to a merchant who had been in the Far East for a long time, and read the works of European travellers there. He noted that Chinese gardens avoided formal rows of trees and flower beds, and instead placed trees, plants, and other garden features in irregular ways to strike the eye and create beautiful compositions, with an understatement criticizing the formal compositions of the gardens at the Palace of Versailles of Louis XIV of France.see Wybe Kuitert \\"Japanese Robes, Sharawadgi, and the landscape discourse of Sir William Temple and Constantijn Huygens\\" Garden History, 41, 2: (2013) p.172 His observations on the Chinese garden were cited by the essayist Joseph Addison in an essay in 1712, who used them to attack the English gardeners who, instead of imitating nature, tried to make their gardens in the French style, as far from nature as possible.Michel Baridon, Les Jardins- Paysagistes, Jarininiers, Poetes. Pg. 839-40. The novelty and exoticism of Chinese art and architecture in Europe led in 1738 to the construction of the first Chinese house in an English garden, in the garden of Stowe House. The style became even more popular thanks to William Chambers (1723‚Äì1796), who lived in China from 1745 to 1747, and wrote a book, Designs of Chinese Buildings, Furniture, Dresses, Machines, and Utensils. To which is annexed, a Description of their Temples, Houses, Gardens, &c.; published in 1757. In 1761 he built a Chinese pagoda, house and garden in Kew, London, as part of Kew Gardens, a park with gardens and architecture symbolizing all parts of the world and all architectural styles. Thereafter Chinese pagodas began to appear in other English gardens, then in France and elsewhere on the continent. French and other European observers coined the term Jardin Anglo-Chinois (Anglo-Chinese garden) for this style of garden. The Gothic temple on Hawkwelle Hill at Stowe House The Gothic revival influence on English gardens In the 1750s, classical architecture and Chinese architecture were joined by Gothic revival ruins in English gardens. This was largely the result of Horace Walpole, who introduced Gothic revival features into his house and garden at Strawberry Hill in Twickenham.Allain and Christiany, pg. 280 At Stowe, Capability Brown followed the new fashion between 1740 and 1753 by adding a new section to the park, called Hawkwelle Hill or the Gothic promenade, with a Gothic revival building.Allain and Christiany, pg. 307 The English garden spreads to the continent English Grounds of W√∂rlitz were one of the largest English parks in 18th-century Europe Descriptions of English gardens were first brought to France by the Abb√© Le Blanc, who published accounts of his voyage in 1745 and 1751. A treatise on the English garden, Observations on Modern Gardening, written by Thomas Whately and published in London in 1770, was translated into French in 1771. After the end of the Seven Years' War in 1763, French noblemen were able to voyage to England and see the gardens for themselves, and the style began to be adapted in French gardens. The new style also had the advantage of requiring fewer gardeners, and was easier to maintain, than the French garden.Allain and Christiany, pg. 316-318. One of the first English gardens on the continent was at Ermenonville, in France, built by marquis Ren√© Louis de Girardin from 1763 to 1776 and based on the ideals of Jean Jacques Rousseau, who was buried within the park. Rousseau and the garden's founder had visited Stowe a few years earlier. Other early examples were the D√©sert de Retz, Yvelines (1774‚Äì1782); the Gardens of the Ch√¢teau de Bagatelle in the Bois de Boulogne, west of Paris (1777‚Äì1784); The Folie Saint James, in Neuilly-sur-Seine, (1777‚Äì1780); and the Ch√¢teau de M√©r√©ville, in the Essonne department, (1784‚Äì1786). Even at Versailles, the home of the most classical of all French gardens, a small English landscape park with a Roman temple was built and a mock village, the Hameau de la Reine (1783‚Äì1789), was created for Marie Antoinette. The monopteros in the Munich Englischer Garten The new style also spread to Germany. The central English Grounds of W√∂rlitz, in the Principality of Anhalt, was laid out between 1769 and 1773 by Prince Leopold III, based on the models of Claremont, Stourhead and Stowe Landscape Garden. Another notable example was The Englischer Garten in Munich, Germany, created in 1789 by Sir Benjamin Thompson (1753‚Äì1814). In the Netherlands the landscape-architect Lucas Pieters Roodbaard (1782‚Äì1851) designed several gardens and parks in this style. The style was introduced to Sweden by Fredrik Magnus Piper. In Poland the main example of this style is ≈Åazienki Park in Warsaw. The garden scheme owes its shape and appearance mainly to the last king of the country Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski (Stanis≈Çaw II Augustus). In another part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth the Sofiyivka Park (Zofi√≥wka), now Ukraine, was designed by Count Potocki so as to illustrate the Odyssey and the Iliad. The style also spread rapidly to Russia, where in 1774 Catherine the Great adapted the new style in the park of her palace at Tsarskoe Selo, complete with a mock Chinese village and a Palladian bridge, modeled after that at Wilton House. A much larger park was created for her son Paul in the neighbouring estate of Pavlovsk. The Monrepos Park is sited on the rocky island of Linnasaari in the Vyborg Bay and is noted for its glacially deposited boulders and granite rocks. Characteristics of the English garden 1803 painting of English garden's elements The continental European \\"English garden\\" is characteristically on a smaller scale and more filled with \\"eye-catchers\\" than most English landscape gardens: grottoes, temples, tea- houses, belvederes, pavilions, sham ruins, bridges and statues, though the main ingredients of the landscape gardens in England are sweeps of gently rolling ground and water, against a woodland background with clumps of trees and outlier groves. The name‚Äînot used in the United Kingdom, where \\"landscape garden\\" serves‚Äîdifferentiates it from the formal Baroque design of the garden √† la fran√ßaise. One of the best-known English gardens in Europe is the Englischer Garten in Munich. The dominant style was revised in the early 19th century to include more \\"gardenesque\\"The term gardenesque was introduced by John Claudius Loudon. features, including shrubberies with gravelled walks, tree plantations to satisfy botanical curiosity, and, most notably, the return of flowers, in skirts of sweeping planted beds. This is the version of the landscape garden most imitated in Europe in the 19th century. The outer areas of the \\"home park\\" of English country houses retain their naturalistic shaping. English gardening since the 1840s has been on a more restricted scale, closer and more allied to the residence. The canonical European English park contains a number of Romantic elements. Always present is a pond or small lake with a pier or bridge. Overlooking the pond is a round or hexagonal pavilion, often in the shape of a monopteros, a Roman temple. Sometimes the park also has a \\"Chinese\\" pavilion. Other elements include a grotto and imitation ruins. A second style of English garden, which became popular during the 20th century in France and northern Europe, is the late 19th-century English cottage garden.From Peasants to Monet - Triumph of English Cottage Gardens Gallery File:Bowood pinetum - Wiltshire, England - DSC00369.jpgPinetum at Bowood House File:Bridge and Mausoleum Castle Howard - panoramio.jpgBridge and mausoleum at Castle Howard File:Sheffield Park Gardens, Fletching, Sussex - geograph.org.uk - 1582535.jpgSheffield Park Garden File:Stowe Park, Buckinghamshire (4663886537).jpgHawkwell Hill with Gothic temple, Cobham monument and Palladian bridge at Stowe House File:Stourhead Pantheon.jpgEyecatching pantheon at Stourhead estate File:Roma - 2016-05-21 - Villa Borghese - 0697.jpgVilla Borghese gardens, Rome, showing the late 18th century \\"Temple of Aesculapius\\", built as an eyecatcher in the manner of the lake at Stourhead File:0 Ch√¢teau Royal de Laeken - Jardins 2 resynt.JPGRoyal Castle of Laeken File:Temple of Friendship in Pavlovsk Park 01.jpgThe \\"Temple of Friendship\\" in Pavlovsk Park File:Grotto at Bowood.jpgGrotto at Bowood House, by Capability Brown Image:W√∂rlitz- Felseninsel Stein MS.jpgFelseninsel Stein and Villa Hamilton in W√∂rlitzer Park See also * List of landscape gardens * German garden * Landscape gardens topics * Landscape design history * Historic garden conservation ReferencesBibliography * Kuitert, Wybe, Japanese Robes, Sharawadgi, and the landscape discourse of Sir William Temple and Constantijn Huygens Garden History, 41, 2: (2013) p. 172 * Kuitert Wybe, Japanese Art, Aesthetics, and a European discourse - unraveling Sharawadgi Japan Review 2014 ISSN 0915-0986 (Vol.27)https://web.archive.org/web/20170318031441/http://publications.nichibun.ac.jp/region/d/NSH/series/jare/2014-08-29/s001/s006/pdf/article.pdf * Clark, H.F., The English Landscape Garden.

The company previously traded as Warrington Borough Transport up until 2006 and as Network Warrington between 2006 and 2018. With the launch of the 'Cheshire Cats' brand in 2018 the company rebanded as Warrington's Own Buses. History Warrington Corporation Tramways started operating a network of five radial tramways from the town centre in 1902, with the first motor bus service starting in 1913. Buses replaced trams on routes starting in 1931, with the infrastructure starting to require major renewal which could not be justified economically. The last tram operated in 1935. Services expanded rapidly after the Second World War as new housing estates grew in areas such as Orford and Great Sankey. The conversion of bus routes with conductors into one-man operated services began in 1965. Warrington was designated as a new town in 1968, which led to new housing estates planned in the Birchwood and Westbrook areas of town. As such, Warrington Borough Council Transport Department started operating new services to these new developments as they started to grow in the 1970s and beyond. The department also began operating new services jointly with Crosville upon the split of the old Stockport based North Western Road Car Company in 1972. To comply with the Transport Act 1985, Warrington Borough Transport was incorporated in 1986. The company's mission was that if money could be made by operating services deemed uneconomic by other operators, then it should assume operation. This policy led to an increase in services operated as other bus companies who ran into the area decided to concentrate on their own core areas. A Marshall C37 bodied Dennis Dart new in 1995 Competition from other operators flared up in 1995, with Warrington Goldlines duplicating the vast majority of the existing bus network following Lancashire Travel's decision to stop competing after a few months. In retaliation to North Western, Warrington Borough Transport commenced operating services to places such as Wigan, St Helens, Widnes, Runcorn, Chester and Liverpool, as well as commencing a local minibus service in Northwich. After eighteen months of intense competition, both companies agreed a truce. Warrington Borough Transport kept routes to Prescot and St Helens, whilst giving up operations in the Birchwood area of town, which were operated North Western. North Western was rebranded as Arriva North West in 1997. In February 2002, Arriva North West decided to close its depot in Warrington and transferred the interurban routes to depots in Liverpool and St Helens. Warrington Borough Transport resumed operation of town routes to Birchwood, Cinnamon Brow and Woolston, but transferred the St Helens route back to Arriva. Further withdrawals by Arriva led to the takeover of routes to Leigh in 2005 and Altrincham in 2006. Throughout the mid-late 2000s, Warrington Borough Transport made several cuts to their longer distance services as part of preparations for their eventual rebrand. In 2006, the company was rebranded and became known as Network Warrington, with a new livery designed by Samantha Beeley.https://web.archive.org/web/20061007220806/http://www.warringtonboroughtransport.co.uk/new/timetables.htmhttps://web.archive.org/web/20061206040615/http://www.warringtonboroughtransport.co.uk/new/timetables.htmhttp://www.networkwarrington.co.uk/assets/library/original/pdf/3/future- timetable-5-6-35-47--- september-2015_web.f54ab2443c9033e4eaa57f9cff682eaf.1439555183.pdf However, this did lead to a streamlining of other routes, both long distance and in the town centre, which were operated with increased frequencies to shorten journey times.https://web.archive.org/web/20061007220855/http://www.warringtonboroughtransport.co.uk/new/tables_pdf/45%20TT.pdfhttps://web.archive.org/web/20061007220932/http://www.warringtonboroughtransport.co.uk/new/tables_pdf/45%20Map.pdfhttps://web.archive.org/web/20060524045909/http://www.warringtonboroughtransport.co.uk/new/tables_pdf/43%20TT%20Summary.pdf Budget cuts by Warrington Borough Council resulted in the network of Sunday evening services being completely withdrawn from 27 June 2010, as these socially necessary services no longer receive any subsidy from the council. The company continues to operate a service during daytime shopping hours on a commercial basis. In April 2018, the company was rebranded as Warrington's Own Buses. Routes Warrington's Own Buses operate a number of routes across the Warrington borough, Cheshire and Greater Manchester. Ticket types Warrington's Own Buses offer a wide range of ticket options for passengers, including singles, returns and all day tickets. Smartcard ticketing is also available. Offices and depot The frontage of the bus depot on Wilderspool Causeway The main depot and offices for Warrington's Own Buses are located on Wilderspool Causeway at the junction with Chester Road The two main sheds to the rear of the site were originally built in 1943 for Fairey Aviation and used to assemble wings for their Fulmar bomber until they were purchased by Warrington Corporation in 1947.Robinson 1987, p.13 This site eventually became the main operational centre, with the frontage of the depot dating from 1964. The ground floor consists of a reception area and vehicle inspection bays, with the company's offices on the upper floor.Robinson 1987, p.15 The Travel Centre on the main concourse at Warrington Bus Interchange provides for season ticket sales and information. Other facilities are located here for driving and supervisory staff. =Former= The original tram system was operated from an eight-track depot at the junction of Mersey Street and Lower Bank Street.Robinson 1987, p.5 A purpose built bus garage was constructed on Lower Bank Street in 1930, although buses were also housed in the old tram sheds following the withdrawal of trams.Robinson 1987, p.9 Despite the move to the new Wilderspool garage, the old staff canteen on Lower Bank Street remained in use until the opening of the new bus station in 1979. The building was demolished in 1981Robinson 1987, p.16 and is today the site of a DW Sports Fitness Club. = Future = Plans were approved for a new state of the art depot to replace the current Wilderspool Causeway depot back in July 2019 located just off Dallam Lane, bringing the depot closer to the main Warrington Interchange. In September 2020 it was yet not known when construction of the new modern facility was due to commence. Fleet A Warrington's Own Buses 215x215px As at March 2019, Warrington's Own Buses' fleet consists of 92 vehicles.Network Warrington Fleet List Network Warrington March 2017 The fleet is entirely low floor and the majority of vehicles in the fleet are single deck, with the most common vehicle type being the Volvo Merit/Wright Cadet midibus, of which there are 35 examples. The newest buses in the fleet date from 2018. Other single deck types in service are the integral Alexander Dennis Enviro200, Optare Versa and the Wright Eclipse 2-bodied Volvo B7RLE, with the latter being the company's largest single deckers. On the double deck side of the fleet, Warrington's Own Buses operate fifteen Volvo B7TLs and five DAF/VDL DB250s. Both types feature bodywork from either Alexander or Wrightbus. Additionally, the company also maintains a heritage fleet. This consists of a Leyland PD2/40 from 1965 and an open top Volvo Olympian new in 1996. The Olympian was originally new to Dublin Bus and acquired in 2008. Both vehicles are used for special occasions and are also available for private hire. On the 24th of December, the company obtained 2 former Alexander Dennis Enviro400City which have been in service since January 2020. The company has also recently bought a variety of other buses from companies near to Warrington. Branding Including the standard fleet livery, which updated in 2018, Warrington's Own Buses has a wide range of branding, which include route specific and advertising liveries. Dedicated route liveries include: * Connect17 ‚Äì routes 17/17A. * The Cheshire Cat ‚Äì routes CAT5, CAT6, CAT7, CAT8 and CAT9 (including variants). * The Pops ‚Äì routes 20/21. There is also a wide range of historical branding and liveries, which include the town's traditional dark red and ivory two-tone livery dating from 1945, with the dark red continuing to feature after the company's 2006 and 2018 re-brands. Some of company's former brands include Super Midi, Super Mini, MidiLines and Centrelink.

He appeared in a series of films with Mabel Normand and worked closely with Charlie Chaplin, both in silent and sound films. Early life Conklin was born in Oskaloosa, Iowa. One of three children, he grew up in a violent household. When he was eight, his mother was found burned to death in the family garden. Although first judged a suicide, his father, a devoutly religious man who hoped his son would be a minister, was eventually charged with murder, but found not guilty at trial. Conklin won first prize when he gave a recitation at a community festival. A few years later, he ran away from home after vowing to a friend he would never return, a promise he kept. Heading to Des Moines he found employment as a hotel bellhop, but then moved to Omaha, Nebraska, where his interest in theatre led to a career in comedic acting. In St. Louis, Missouri, he saw a performance by the vaudeville team of Joe Weber and Lew Fields, which prompted Conklin to develop a character based on his boss at the time, a man with a thick accent and a bushy walrus moustache. With this character, Conklin broke into vaudeville, and spent several years touring with various stock companies, doing vaudeville shows and minstrel shows. He also performed as a clown with the Al G. Barnes Wild Animal Show. Career Chester Conklin in 1919 After seeing several Mack Sennett comedies while in Venice, California during the 1913 winter break, the 27-year-old Conklin went to Keystone Studios, applied for a job and was hired as a Keystone Kop with a salary of $3 a day. Sennett directed him in his first film, a comedy short titled Hubby's Job.TCM Biography In 1914, Conklin co-starred with Mabel Normand in a series of films: Mabel's Strange Predicament, Mabel's New Job, Mabel's Busy Day and Mabel at the Wheel. In that same year he appeared in Making a Living, in which Charlie Chaplin made his film debut. He would go on to make more than a dozen films with Chaplin while at Keystone and the two became lifelong friends. Years later, Conklin would perform with Chaplin in two more feature-length films, first in 1936 in Modern Times and in 1940's The Great Dictator. During this time, Chaplin kept Conklin on year-round salary.Erickson, Hal Biography (Allmovie) While at Keystone, Conklin became most famous when he was teamed up with the robust comic Mack Swain to make a series of comedies. With Swain as \\"Ambrose\\" and Conklin as the grand mustachioed \\"Walrus\\", they performed these roles in several films including The Battle of Ambrose and Walrus and Love, Speed and Thrills, both made in 1915. Beyond these \\"Ambrose & Walrus\\" comedies, the two appeared together in twenty-six different films. In 1920, when Sennett refused to discuss a contract renewal with Conklin and insisted on referring him to an underling, Conklin quit and went to Fox Film Corporation, which had earlier approached him about doing a series of comedy shorts. He also worked at the Famous Players-Lasky Corporation studio. In between, he had a significant role as ZaSu Pitts' father in director Erich von Stroheim's acclaimed 1924 MGM production, Greed, although the part was cut from the film and the footage is now lost, and in 1928 in the Christie Film Company version of Tillie's Punctured Romance with W.C. Fields, which had nothing to do with the 1914 Chaplin version (in which Conklin had also appeared) aside from the title. Paramount Pictures teamed up Conklin and Fields for a series of comic films between 1927 and 1931. Conklin made the transition to talkies and, although he would continue to act for another thirty years, age and the shift in moviegoing tastes to more sophisticated comedy saw his roles limited to secondary or smaller parts in shorts, including the Three Stooges shorts Flat Foot Stooges (as a fire chief), Dutiful But Dumb (as a bartender), Three Little Twirps (as a Circus butcher), Phony Express (as a bartender), and Micro-Phonies (as a drunken pianist who answers a song request with \\"Know it? I wrote it!\\"). Conklin also appeared in films that appealed to nostalgia for the silent era, such as Hollywood Cavalcade (1939) and The Perils of Pauline (1947). In Soundies musicals, he appeared with other silent-comedy alumni as The Keystone Kops, as well as on the televised This Is Your Life tribute to Mack Sennett. Conklin was part of Preston Sturges' unofficial \\"stock company\\" of character actors in the 1940s, appearing in cameo parts in six films written by Sturges.Conklin appeared in Sullivan's Travels, The Palm Beach Story, The Miracle of Morgan's Creek, Hail the Conquering Hero, The Great Moment and The Beautiful Blonde from Bashful Bend, Sturges' last American film. Conklin was also in I Married a Witch, which Sturges produced, and had earlier appeared in Hotel Haywire, written by Sturges. In 1957, he was a guest challenger on the TV panel show To Tell The Truth, dressed in his Keystone Kops uniform. Her Majesty, Love First National Pictures (1931) Personal life On April 12, 1933, Conklin was divorced from Minnie V. Conklin after a marriage of 18 years and nine months. He married Margherita Rouse on May 5, 1934, in Hollywood. She died on May 14, 1937. On June 17, 1965, Conklin married former actress June Gunther in Las Vegas. Decline and death Conklin's career hit bottom in the 1950s, and he took work as a department-store Santa Claus to make ends meet. In the 1960s, Conklin was living at the Motion Picture Country Home and Hospital when he fell in love with another patient there, June Gunther. The two got married in Las Vegas in 1965, his fourth marriage and her fourth,Time, July 2, 1965 and set up housekeeping in Van Nuys, California; the groom was seventy-nine and the bride sixty-five. Conklin made one last film after that, a Western comedy, A Big Hand for the Little Lady, released in 1966. Chester Conklin died in autumn 1971 in California at the age of 85. He was cremated and his ashes were given to his family. Following his death, his great nephew, Robert Stoltz, along with his sisters rested his ashes at sea in the Pacific Ocean. For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Conklin has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1560 Vine Street.

The play is run farther outside than an off tackle play. Variants of the sweep involve the quarterback or a wide receiver running with the ball, rather than a running back.  Types of the sweep  Toss sweep = A toss sweep is a play that is usually run out of the I formation or single set back formation. The quarterback takes the snap, reverses out, then tosses the ball to the tailback. When run from the I formation, it allows the fullback to pick up any defenders who have penetrated into the backfield. Blocking from the offensive line ranges from straight zone blocking to pulling the playside guard. While this sweep doesn't have as many playfake combinations as the buck sweep, it tends to be more powerful and allows the running back to turn upfield faster. = Buck sweep = The buck sweep is usually run from a Wing T formation that includes a variety of play fakes. The quarterback takes the snap and fakes trap to the fullback. He then hands off to a halfback or wingback, who runs to the outside. The buck sweep is normally blocked by pulling the playside guard to kickout the force defender, and the backside guard pulling and turning up on the playsided linebacker. This allows for the other linemen to downblock on the other defenders, giving the offense an advantage when it comes to blocking angles. The buck sweep also provides an advantage in the possibilities available from its action, with the fullback trap before the sweep, a \\"waggle\\" pass, or bootleg after it, and the sweep itself. Packers sweep Vince Lombardi, head coach of the Green Bay Packers, was fond of the sweep. In the 1960s, he utilized the Packers sweep play‚Äîalso known as the Lombardi sweep‚Äîin which guards Jerry Kramer and Fuzzy Thurston rapidly pulled out from their normal positions and led blocking for the running back (typically Paul Hornung or Jim Taylor) going around the end. It was an integral part of an offense that won five NFL titles in seven years. = Flanker sweep = Also known as the jet sweep or fly sweep, this sweep is a running play that is run from a set with a wide receiver (flanker) split out to the side away from the play, often run with the receiver in motion. The quarterback receives the snap and turns or runs toward the receiver, as the receiver makes a deep arc into the backfield behind the quarterback, where there is an exchange either by handoff or by pitching the ball to the receiver. This play typically resembles Student Body Right, in that every available blocker blocks to the playside. The variant that became popular in the National Football League (NFL) in 2018 is often run with the quarterback in a shotgun formation and the receiver crossing in front of him to receive the ball; when run in this manner using a pitch, the pitch is considered a forward pass, resulting in an incomplete pass rather than a fumble if the ball is dropped. = Quarterback sweep = The quarterback sweep is a running play where the quarterback takes the snap from center, typically in a shotgun formation, and then runs to the outside. This play can best be run by a fast, athletic quarterback. Sweeps often involve pulling of offensive linemen, usually one or both guards, to provide extra blockers at the point of attack. Teams such as the Arkansas Razorbacks have had success running this play by lining up the halfback as the quarterback in a wildcat formation.

It was the film debut of the original four members who would later, minus Ted Healy, go on to become known as The Three Stooges comic trio (Shemp Howard, Moe Howard, and Larry Fine). Goldberg made a cameo appearance in the film as himself, opening letters in a restaurant. Several other comedians are also featured. Plot Ted Healy is a salesman for the Schmidt Costume Shop who likes to hang out at the fire station where Moe (billed as \\"Harry Howard\\"), Larry, and Shemp (along with Fred Sanborn) work. Old man Schmidt spends more time building crazy inventions (typical of devices by writer/cartoonist Rube Goldberg) than tending to his business; as a consequence he is bankrupt and his business is taken over by his creditors, who send a young man named Carlson to manage the business. Carlson immediately falls for Mr. Schmidt's niece, Louise, but she resists him. Meanwhile, a certain General Avocado wants to organize a revolution in San Stevedore and comes to the costume shop to order uniforms; sadly his army flees in fright without paying at the sound of a child bursting a toy balloon. Ted also swings a deal with the Fire Department to supply costumes for the fireman's ball. Carlson wants to take Louise, so Ted hatches a plan to take Louise, and have himself and Carlson dressed alike, then switch places at the ball. When Louise learns of the switch, she runs back to the shop and locks herself in her room. Carlson chases her home, and unknowingly starts a fire while trying to persuade her to come out. The firemen (the Stooges) arrive to extinguish the blaze ‚Äî with the unexpected help of one of Old Man Schmidt's inventions ‚Äî and at last Louise and Carlson are a couple.

They rejoined Healy in July 1932 for the Broadway revue PASSING SHOW OF 1932, but Healy quit during rehearsals, which subsequently prompted Shemp Howard to leave on August 19, 1932 (he remained with PASSING for a time, and then began a solo career, landing at Brooklyn's Vitaphone Studios in May 1933). Younger Howard brother Jerry replaced Shemp on August 20, 1932, and Ted Healy's stooges became Moe, Larry & Curly. The Stooges finally split from Healy in March 1934, and became The Three Stooges at Columbia Studios. (When Curly was debilitated by strokes years later, Shemp reluctantly abandoned his solo career and returned to the Stooges). In Soup To Nuts, Shemp appears to be the \\"leader\\" of the three. He has most of the dialogue and does a lot of the pushing and hitting. Plus, Shemp was billed before the other two in the credits. Also note that Moe was credited as \\"Harry Howard.\\" In the film, the Stooges use one of their longest running gags.

The light morph is dark greyish brown on the upperparts with fine barring and pale spots along the scapulars. The underparts are reddish buff with a dense pattern of fine barring on the flight feathers and tail. The dark morph is overall dark chocolate brown but no specimen of a dark morph individual has been taken. It measures approximately in length and the wingspan is . =Voice= A whistled \\"toot\\" which is given repeatedly with one second intervals. Distribution and habitat Endemic to the island of Grande Comore, the Karthala scops owl is found only on Mount Karthala, an active volcano. Here it inhabits the montane forest, some secondary growth and the tree heath above the forest. Habits Nocturnal and very territorial, the Karthala scops owl will approach an imitation of its call, otherwise almost unknown. It has relatively weak talons so probably feeds on insects and other invertebrates. It is thought to nest in tree cavities. Status and population It has an estimated population of 2,000. It is classified as endangered due to it being restricted to such a small area, which is being rapidly deforested. Taxonomy The Karthala scops owl was formerly considered to be a subspecies of the Madagascar scops owl Otus rutilus, but with the other Comoro Islands scops owls it is now regarded as a separate species.

Khalid, the son of Barmak became the chief minister (wazir) of Al Saffah, the first Caliph of the Abbasid dynasty. His son Yahya aided Harun Al-Rashid in capturing the throne and rose to power as the most powerful man in the Caliphate. The Barmakids were remarkable for their majesty, splendor and hospitality. They are mentioned in some stories of the One Thousand and One Nights.  Origins  The family is traceable back to the hereditary Buddhist administrators of the Buddhist monastery of Nava VihƒÅra (Nawbahar) west of Balkh (Northern Afghanistan).Kevin van Bladel, \\"The Bactrian Background of the Barmakids\\" ch.3 in A. Akasoy, C. Burnett and R. Yoeli-Tlalim (eds.) \`\`Islam and Tibet: Interactions along the Musk Routes, Ashgate, 2011, 43-88 Historians of Islam have sometimes considered the Barmakids to have been Zoroastrian priests before converting to Islam, an erroneous view based on the fact that Balkh was known as an important centre of Zoroastrianism, or from a simple failure of early Islamic sources to distinguish Zoroastrians from Buddhists. In fact, the Barmakids descended from the chiefs, or administrators of the Buddhist monastery called NavavihƒÅra (Skt. ‡§®‡§µ‡§µ‡§ø‡§π‡§æ‡§∞) or \\"New Monastery\\", that was described by the Chinese Buddhist diarist Xuanzang in the seventh centuryEncyclopedia of Islam, 2 ed., v.1, pp.1033 ff. Online as: \\"al-BarƒÅmika.\\" Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Brill Online , 2012. Reference. Universitaet Wien. 24 July 2012 which may have led to the Persian and Arabic error of thinking that the term \\"NowbahƒÅr\\" was the name of a Zoroastrian fire temple headed by the Barmakids as reported in Islamic sources. The Pramukhas converted during the Arab invasion of the Sasanian Empire. Harold Bailey proposed that the name of the Barmakids May derive from the Sanskrit word ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ñ Pramukha, meaning ‚Äúleader,‚Äù although the theory is subject of debate. The Barmakids were highly educated, respected and influential throughout Arabia, Persia, Central Asia and the Levant. In Baghdad, the Barmakid court became a centre of patronage for the Ulema, poets, scholars alike. The first member of the family whose identity is known in historical records was a physician of Balkh. He is reputed for a pill named after him and also recommended by Avicenna in addition to a scent which was widely used by prostitutes. According to al- Masudi, the name Barmak was not a name but a title of the high priest of the fire temple of the city, though recent research makes it certain that it was a Buddhist title changed to look more Iranian. His wife was enslaved during the battle for Balkh in 705 and given to the Arab general's brother 'Abd-Ullah. Their sexual relation produced a son known as Khalid, whom 'Abd-Ullah later acknowledged as his natural son. She was later restored to her husband after peace was reached. Barmak had also been summoned to cure Caliph Abd al-Malik's son Maslama in 705. Abu Hafs 'Umar al-Kirmani's account narrates that the Barmak was brought among a party of shakirriya (thought to be slaves or retainers) and honored by the Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik who increased his status and was impressed by him. He then became a Muslim and enjoyed a high status. Clifford Edmund Bosworth states that it isn't known when or where the Barmak died, nor is his conversion certain, despite al-Kirmani's account. al- Kirmani states that he may have retained his faith as his son Khalid's beliefs were suspect, according to Ibn 'Asakir. Ibn al-Faqih records that his father had to abandon Islam after converting due to pressure from local magnates as well as people of Tukharistan and was even attacked by Tarkhan Nizak, being killed along with his ten sons. Khalid was born a Buddhist and later converted to Islam, taking various ministerial jobs within the Abbasid Caliphate. The Buddhist ancestry of Baramkids seems to have stimulated interest in Indian sciences in the eighth century. =Khalid al-Barmaki= See Khalid ibn Barmak. Khalid al-Barmaki (705‚Äì782) occupied distinguished positions under first two Abbasid Caliphs, al-Saffah (722‚Äì754) and al-Mansur (714‚Äì775). He had risen to be the vizier, following death of Abu Salma and Abul Jahm. Khalid was on such intimate terms with al-Saffah that his daughter was nursed by the wife of the Caliph. Likewise, Caliph's daughter was nursed by Khalid's wife. Under Abbasid regime Khalid rose to the headship of the department of Finance (diwan al- Kharaj) This department was concerned with Taxation and Land Tenure. Genuine budgets began to be drawn up for the first time and offices sprang up for various departments. The extensive staff of officials engaged in correspondence with the provinces and prepared estimates and accounts. An influential stratum of officialdom, the Irano-Islamic class of secretaries (kuttab in Arabic, dabiran in Persian), was formed which considered itself as the main support of the state. Their knowledge of the complex system of the kharaj (land tax) which took account not only of the quality of the land but of the produce of the crops sown, made the officials of the diwan al-Kharaj; the guardians of knowledge which was inaccessible to the uninitiated and was passed by inheritance. In 765, Khalid al-Barmaki received the governorship of Tabaristan, where he crushed a dangerous uprising. During his governorship of Upper Mesopotamia, Khalid, through a mix of firmness and justice, brought the province quickly into order and effectively curbed the unruly Kurds. = Ya·∏•y√° ibn KhƒÅlid = Khalid's son, Ya·∏•y√° ibn KhƒÅlid (d. 806), at one time Governor of Arminiya, was entrusted by Caliph al-Mahdi (775-85) with the education of his son, Harun, the future Caliph al-Rashid. = al-Fadl and Ja'far = Ya·∏•ya's sons al-Fadl (766‚Äì808) and Ja'far (767‚Äì803), both occupied high offices under Harun al-Rashid.  Influence under the early Abbasids  The Barmakid family was an early supporter of the Abbasid revolt against the Umayyads and of As-Saffah. This gave Khalid bin Barmak considerable influence, and his son Ya·∏•y√° ibn KhƒÅlid (d. 806) was the vizier of the caliph al-Mahdi (ruled 775‚Äì785) and tutor of HƒÅr≈´n al-Rashid (ruled 786‚Äì809). Yahya's sons al- Fadl and Ja'far (767‚Äì803), both occupied high offices under Harun. Many Barmakids were patrons of the sciences, which greatly helped the propagation of Iranian science and scholarship into the Islamic world of Baghdad and beyond. They patronized scholars such as Gebir and Jabril ibn Bukhtishu. They are also credited with the establishment of the first paper mill in Baghdad. The power of the Barmakids in those times is reflected in The Book of One Thousand and One Nights; the vizier Ja'far appears in several stories, as well as a tale that gave rise to the expression \\"Barmecide feast\\".  Loss of support at the Abbasid court and murder of Jafar  In 803, the family lost favor in the eyes of Harun al-Rashƒ´d, and many of its members were imprisoned. According to Rit Nosotro, Harun al-Rashƒ´d found his chief pleasure in the society of his sister  øAbbƒÅsa and Barmakid prince Jafar bin Yahya. In order that these two might be with him continuously without breach of the restrictions on women, he persuaded them to contract a purely formal marriage. This marriage was on condition the two would meet only in his presence, and never produce an heir. This condition was broken, and when Harun learned that  øAbbƒÅsa had borne a son, he had Jafar suddenly arrested and beheaded, and the rest of the family, except Yahya's brother Mu·∏•ammad, also imprisoned and deprived of their property. However, al-Tabari and Ibn Khald≈´n mentioned other reasons ensuring that their decline was gradual and not sudden. These other reasons are: *The Barmakids' monetary extravagance, so that in displays of wealth they overshadowed HƒÅrun himself. It has been said that Yahya ibn Khalid had gold tiles on the wall of his mansion, and Jafar ibn Yahya's mansion cost twenty million dirhams. HƒÅrun became upset on a tour of Baghdad: whenever he saw an impressive house or mansion, he was told it belonged to the Barmakids. *The hostility of al-Fadl ibn al-Rabi', an official very close to HƒÅrun. He convinced HƒÅr≈´n to assign spies to watch them, and that is how HƒÅr≈´n found out about the escape of Yahya ibn Abdullah al-Talibi. *The Yahya ibn Abdullah al- Talibi incident. In AH 176, Yahya ibn Abdullah went to Daylam in Persia and called for rule by himself in place of HƒÅr≈´n. Many people followed him, and he became strong enough to threaten HƒÅr≈´n. HƒÅr≈´n captured him, and placed him in house arrest in the custody of Barmakid al-Fadl ibn Yahya. However, al-Fadl ibn Yahya instead connived at Yahya ibn Abdullah's escape from Baghdad. The Caliph considered that to be high treason. *The Barmakid army. Although technically this army of 50,000 men was under the Caliph, in reality, it was controlled by al-Fadl ibn Yahya. During the last days of Barmakid power, al- Fadl brought 20,000 men to Baghdad as the Karnabiya Legion. This made Harun very wary of their intentions. *The Governor of Khurasan at the time, Ali ibn Isa ibn Mahan, sent a letter to HƒÅrun reporting unrest in his province, which he blamed on Musa ibn Yahya, another brother of Jafar. The fall of the Iranian Barmakids did not, however, affect the prominent position of the Persians in the Abbasid court, which continued until al-Mutawakkil. Felicia Hemans reflects on the suppression by HƒÅrun even of their name in her poem The Mourner for the Barmecides, published in 1826.  Legacy  A number of canals, mosques and other public works owe their existence to the initiative and munificence of the Barmakids. Al Fadl ibn Yahya is credited with introducing the use of lamps in the mosques during the holy month of Ramadan. They are also credited with the establishment of the first paper mill in Baghdad. Jafar ibn Yahya acquired great fame for eloquence, literary activity, and calligraphy. Hitti argues that chiefly because of him, Arab historians regard the Barmakids as the founders of the class designated as 'people of the pen' (ahl al-qalam). The long neck which Barmakids possessed is said to have been responsible for the introduction of the custom of wearing high collars. The first extant Arabic report on India was prepared under the directions of Yahya ibn Barmak by his envoy. The Barmakids invited several scholars and physicians from everywhere in the caliphate to the court of Abbasids. During the Caliphate campaigns in India, Khalid ibn Barmak built the city of Mansura (Brahmanabad) there. Khalid was later in charge of the building of Baghdad. On 30 July 763, the caliph Al Mansur concluded the construction of the city.  Family TreeTrivia Baramkeh which is named after the Barmakids, is a neighborhood and district in the Qanawat municipality of Damascus.

The series starred William Russell as the eponymous Sir Lancelot, a Knight of the Round Table in the time of King Arthur at Camelot. It was originally broadcast on NBC in the United States from 1956 to 1957. Its success on the network led to it becoming the first British television series to have entire episodes filmed in colour, with the last fourteen of the thirty half-hour episodes being shot on colour stock, although they were seen in colour only in the US. (Although the BBC's 1954 TV series Zoo Quest pre-dated The Adventures of Sir Lancelot's use of colour film stock by two years, this was only for the location work whilst the studio links were captured by monochrome video cameras). As was common with other British television series of the time, the programme employed several American screenwriters who had moved to Britain after being placed on the Hollywood blacklist, often under pseudonyms. These included Ian McLellan Hunter, Hy Kraft and Ring Lardner Jr. The series was made at Nettlefold Studios in Walton-on-Thames. Cast and characters *William Russell as Sir Lancelot (30 episodes) *Cyril Smith as MerlinA running joke in the series is that Merlin the magician is plainly seen to have no magical powers, but to use low cunning and various tricks and deceits to achieve his supposedly magical effects.

It is two miles to the south-east of Ulverston on the northern coast of Morecambe Bay. It is in the historic county of Lancashire. History Bardsea, or Berretseige, is mentioned in the Domesday Book as one of the townships forming the Manor of Hougun held by Earl Tostig.Hougun (The Domesday Book On-Line) Also once part of the medieval manor of Muchland. Bardsea was once a small farming and fishing village well into the 19th century. It was accessed mainly by crossing the treacherous sands of Morecambe Bay. The church of Holy Trinity was consecrated in 1853. Previously the area had been included within the parish of Urswick. The area was also associated with the early Quaker movement. When founder George Fox married local landowner Margaret Fell, he took over Swarthmoor Hall and much of the land round Bardsea. There is an old Quaker burial ground nearby at Sunbrick on Birkrigg Common, where Margaret Fell was reputedly buried in 1702 (one authority suggests she was interred at the burial ground at Swarthmoor, although that is contradicted by other sources). George Fox himself was buried in London. When iron ore mining and production led to industrialisation in Furness, Bardsea became a significant port, with steamers leaving for Fleetwood and Liverpool. That was short-lived, however, with the Furness Railway and Ulverston Canal taking business away from the village by the end of the Victorian period. A branch line from Plumpton Junction, on the main railway to Barrow, which opened in 1883, was supposed to run to Bardsea and beyond, but the rails never got closer than Conishead Priory, about to the north. The line closed in 1917. Community Bardsea currently has one used public house; the Ship Inn which was a farm in 1750. Bardsea also has a converted Malt Kiln, dated 1829 and once part of the Well Wood estate, which is now used as a village hall. The Hartley family bought the hall and set up a trust deed in memory of local men who were killed in the war, handing over the malt Kiln to the community. Geography Nearby locations of interest are the common with prehistoric Birkrigg stone circle, Sea Wood which once belonged to Lady Jane Grey, the Manjushri Centre at Conishead Priory and Chapel Island used as a sanctuary when crossing the sands.

The film features George Montgomery, Nancy Guild and Conrad Janis.. Fred MacMurray, Victor Mature, and Dana Andrews were all mentioned at different times as having been cast as Philip Marlowe in the film before the studio settled on George MontgomeryHarnisch, Larry.

The High Window had already been adapted for film in 1942 as a Michael Shayne adventure starring Lloyd Nolan. Plot Private detective Philip Marlowe is hired by wealthy widow, Elizabeth Murdock, to investigate the theft of a rare coin, the Brasher Doubloon, from her deceased husband's private collection. Believing the case to be a fairly routine one, Marlowe soon finds himself confronted by murder and a succession of shady characters and lethal crooks. The course of his investigation leads Marlowe to realise that the source of the mystery hinges upon Merle Davis, the timid and neurotic secretary of Mrs Murdock. Cast * George Montgomery as Philip Marlowe * Nancy Guild as Merle Davis * Conrad Janis as Leslie Murdock * Roy Roberts as Lt. Breeze * Fritz Kortner as Vannier * Florence Bates as Mrs. Elizabeth Murdock * Marvin Miller as Vince Blair * Reed Hadley as Dr. Moss (uncredited) Production The novel was published in 1942. The New York Times said \\"Chandler has given us a detective who is hard boiled enough to be convincing without being disgustingly tough and that is no mean achievement.\\" Film rights were bought by 20th Century Fox in May 1942 who used it as the basis of a script for a movie in their B-picture series about Michael Shayne, A Time to Kill (1942). Following the success of the Chandler adaptation Murder My Sweet (1944) and the Chandler-written Double Indemnity (1944), the author became in fashion in Hollywood ‚Äì Warners filmed The Big Sleep, MGM did The Lady in the Lake (1946) and Paramount filmed a Chandler original, The Blue Dahlia (1946). Fox decided to film The High Window again, this time more faithfully. In May 1945, they announced that Leonard Praskins was writing a script and Robert Bassler would produce. Fred MacMurray, who had been in Indemnity, would play Marlowe In October 1945 Fox announced that John Payne would play the lead role and that filming would begin in January 1946. In December there was another casting change ‚Äì Victor Mature was given the role. John Brahm was assigned to direct. Both Mature and Brahm were taken off Three Little Girls in Blue to do the film. In January 1946 Fox announced that the film would star Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney, who had been so successful in Laura, and that Richard Macaulay would write the script. In May 1946 Fox said that George Montgomery would play the lead and that filming would begin in July. Ida Lupino was to co star. By June Lupino had dropped out and was replaced by Nancy Guild. At one stage John Ireland was meant to be in the cast. In July 1946 the title was changed to The Brasher Doubloon. ReceptionCritical response= When the film was released, The New York Times film critic panned the film, writing, \\"... Chandler's popular 'shamus' and, we might add, his efforts to recover the stolen brasher doubloon, a rare coin with a violent history, is the least of his exploits to date. Perhaps this is due equally to a pedestrian adaptation of Mr. Chandler's novel, The High Window, to the plodding and conventional direction accorded the film by John Brahm, and to the lack of conviction in George Montgomery's interpretation of Marlowe.\\" Film critic Dennis Schwartz, on the other hand, liked the film, and wrote, \\"A film noir similar in theme and almost as enjoyable as The Big Sleep, as private investigator Philip Marlowe (George Montgomery) leaves his Hollywood office for a case in Pasadena from a rich old widow who lives in a dark old house. It's just smart enough of a film noir to be considered a classic ... This brooding Gothic melodrama is brought to life by John Brahm's expressionistic ambiance ably photographed by cinematographer Lloyd Ahern and by the sharp hard-boiled Raymond Chandler story the film is adapted from, The High Window. The film is not as complex as the novel, but it makes good use of its snappy dialogue and has vividly grotesque characterizations to go along with the dark mood it sets. Fritz Kortner stands out in his villainous role, which he plays like Peter Lorre would; while Florence Bates is charmingly acerbic in her creepy role as a bitter old hag.\\"Schwartz, Dennis.

The classification is updated on a regular basis by a Committee of Experts, consisting of representatives of the Contracting States of that Agreement with observers from other organisations, such as the European Patent Office. Classification Patent publications from all of the Contracting States (and also most others) are each assigned at least one classification symbol indicating the subject to which the invention relates and may also be assigned further classification symbols and indexing codes to give further details of the contents. Each classification symbol is of the form A01B 1/00 (which represents \\"hand tools\\"). The first letter represents the \\"section\\" consisting of a letter from A (\\"Human Necessities\\") to H (\\"Electricity\\"). Combined with a two digit number, it represents the \\"class\\" (class A01 represents \\"Agriculture; forestry; animal husbandry; trapping; fishing\\").

It was built by the Liverpool, Crosby and Southport Railway Company and now stands at the junction between the branch to Southport and the branch to Ormskirk and Kirkby. The two platforms form a single island, overlooking the River Mersey on one side, and the former industrial area of Commercial Road on the other. It is also used by football fans heading for Liverpool F.C. and Everton F.C. matches: a bus service called Soccerbus runs between the station and the football stadiums on match-days only. Previously passengers had to walk up a ramp to reach the ticket office, then through a subway and up ramps to reach the platform. Now the ramp remains, with alternate staircase. Leading to a lift directly into the Booking Office, accessing both sides of the island platforms.  History  Sandhills opened in 1850 as an intermediate station when the Liverpool, Crosby and Southport Railway was extended from its previous terminal at Waterloo to Liverpool Exchange. It became part of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR), on 14 June 1855. who took over from the (LCSR). The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway amalgamated with the London and North Western Railway on 1 January 1922 and in turn was Grouped into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923. Nationalisation followed in 1948 and in 1978 the station became part of the Merseyrail Network's Northern Line (operated by British Rail until privatised in 1995). The station had four wooden platforms until it was rationalised in 1973. An extensive refurbishment plan for the station was suggested in 2006 which involved the building of a completely new booking hall and greatly improved facilities on the platform. A large canopy was constructed - originally intended to cover the entire length of the platform, but now eventually covering approximately half. In addition, a dedicated bus-rail interchange point was built, improving transport beyond the station to localities such as Kirkdale, Anfield and Everton. On 24 April 2007, improvement works to the station at a cost of ¬£6 million were agreed. In November 2007, it was announced that the station would be closed from 17 November 2007 until March 2008 for refurbishment.Merseytravel - Temporary Closure of Sandhills Station 17 November 2007 to March 2008. Accessed 5 November 2007 The refurbishment work was extended until July 2008, when the station reopened in a partly completed state. The full completion of the work at the station was finished in early 2009. Facilities The station is staffed 15 minutes before the first service and 15 minutes after the last service. There are toilets, platform CCTV and a booking office. There are departure and arrival screens on the platform for passenger information. Each of the two platforms has sheltered seating. The station does not have a car park, though there is a cycle rack with 10 spaces. The station is fully wheelchair accessible and access to the station is via lifts and ramps.

Land History  In the early nineteenth century, the estate of Sandhills was purchased by Liverpool solicitor and land speculator, John Leigh (1752-1823). As well as building a 'handsome house, where he had beautiful gardens, complete with hothouses and conservatories'. He also turned much of the pasture land to clay pits and brickworks needed to fuel the rapid growth of Liverpool - he reputedly lowered the ground level by seven or eight feet (well over two metres). His son, John Shaw Leigh (1791-1871) reaped the most benefit, selling plots piecemeal at huge profits to supply the land needed for the expanding docks and railways.

Education  Dawes was born in Chapel of Ease, part of Abercarn near Newbridge. He was educated at Lewis School Pengam, and later University College of Wales, Aberystwyth and Loughborough College. He gained a degree in chemistry and later achieved a PGCE at Loughborough College.  Rugby playing career Club= Dawes played club rugby for Newbridge in Monmouthshire. He then joined London Welsh. Dawes was appointed captain, and effectively also as coach, for the 1965-66 season, leading the club in a period of great success in the late 1960s. He initially significantly increased fitness levels, and then led the club in an open, running, quick-passing, attacking style of rugby, including an overlapping full-back, and relatively skilled forwards. One 1968-69 performance was described by journalist John Reasonhttps://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid;=10425614https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/columnists/brendangallagher/2307779/About- Rugby-Special-tribute-to-John-Reason.html as \\"one of the most brilliant exhibitions of club football it has been my privilege to see,\\" and by journalist Terry O'Connorhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/3015852/Talking-Rugby- Union-Game-enriched-by-competitive-line-out.html as \\"the finest display by a club team I can remember', further describing London Welsh 'switching attacks with speed and handling skill.' The Man Who Changed the World of Rugby - John Dawes and the Legendary 1971 British Lions, Ross Reyburn https://www.therugbyjournal.com/rugby-blog/john-dawes =International= Dawes won his first cap for Wales against Ireland in 1964. He was selected for Wales' first overseas tour later the same year and played in the Welsh rugby team's first match outside of Europe and its first in the Southern Hemisphere. He played against East Africa in Nairobi on 12 May 1964, Wales winning 26-8. He went on to make 22 appearances for Wales, captaining the side in six of them, including leading the Grand Slam winning side of 1971. = British Lions and Barbarians = In 1971, Dawes was appointed captain of the British and Irish Lions side for the tour to New Zealand. This side, coached by Carwyn James, became the first and so far the only Lions team to win a series in New Zealand. Dawes was also captain of the Barbarians side that beat New Zealand in Cardiff in 1973. Today he holds a proud record for any Welshman in the fact that as a player or coach he has never lost to an England side. He is one of five captains to lead his side to a test series win on New Zealand soil, along with Philip J. Nel (1937 Springboks), Trevor Allan (1949 Australia), Andrew Slack (1986 Australia) and Philippe Saint-Andr√© (1994 France).  Rugby coaching career  After retiring as a player, Dawes became coach of the Welsh national side in 1974, a post he held until 1979. This was one of the most successful periods in the history of Welsh rugby, with the team winning the Five Nations Championship four times in the five seasons between 1975 and 1979, including two Grand Slams. He also coached the 1977 British Lions tour to New Zealand, but was unable to repeat the success of 1971. Ian McGeechan has said of this tour \\"perhaps John, a natural player and leader in his time, was just not so good at putting things across,\\" but others have pointed out that the 1977 Lions nearly drew the series, and that subsequent Lions tours to New Zealand fared much worse.The Man Who Changed the World of Rugby - John Dawes and the Legendary 1971 British Lions, Ross Reyburn  Subsequent roles  Dawes is currently president of London Welsh RFC and has written several books on rugby union.

Literally, the terms mean a thing that changes, referring to a state of transformation or shapeshifting. These words are often translated as \\"ghost\\", but primarily they refer to living things or supernatural beings who have taken on a temporary transformation, and these bakemono are distinct from the spirits of the dead.Mayer p. 89 However, as a secondary usage, the term obake can be a synonym for y≈´rei, the ghost of a deceased human being.Daijirin and Daijisen definitions of obake. A bakemono's true form may be an animal such as a fox (kitsune), a raccoon dog (bake-danuki), a badger (mujina), a transforming cat (bakeneko), the spirit of a plant‚Äîsuch as a kodama, or an inanimate object which may possess a soul in Shinto and other animistic traditions. Obake derived from household objects are often called tsukumogami. A bakemono usually either disguises itself as a human or appears in a strange or terrifying form such as a hitotsume-koz≈ç, an ≈çny≈´d≈ç, or a noppera-b≈ç. In common usage, any bizarre apparition can be referred to as a bakemono or an obake whether or not it is believed to have some other form, making the terms roughly synonymous with y≈çkai.Daijirin and Daijisen dictionary definitions. In Hawaii Due to the influence of a large number of Hawaiian population with Japanese ancestry, on the islands of Hawaii the term obake has found its way into the dialect of the local people. Some Japanese stories concerning these creatures have found their way into local culture in Hawaii: numerous sightings of kappa have been reported on the islands, and the Japanese faceless ghosts called noppera-b≈ç have also become well known in Hawaii under the name mujina. This name confusion seems to have stemmed from a story by Lafcadio Hearn titled \\"Mujina\\", a story about a badger (mujina) which takes the form of a noppera-b≈ç, rather than being one itself, which first introduced the faceless ghost to the Western world. Hawaiian folklorist Glen Grant was known for his Obake Files, a series of reports he developed about supernatural incidents in Hawaii. The grand bulk of these incidents and reports were of Japanese origin or concerned obake.Grant In popular culture Bakemono is featured in The Terror: Infamy, the second season of AMC's television series, The Terror.

He corresponded with John Ray and some of his notes and specimens were used by Carolus Linnaeus in descriptions of new species. The genus Petiveria was named in his honour by Charles Plumier. His collections were bought by Sir Hans Sloane and became a part of the natural history museum. Life Born somewhere between 1663 and 1665 in Hillmorton, Warwickshire to James and Mary n√©e Elborow, the family moved to London soon after where his father became a haberdasher. After the death of his father in 1676, Petiver was sent to Rugby Free School, sponsored by his maternal grandfather Richard Elborow. Petiver later stated that \\"I have often bewailed my not being allowed after that time academical learning.\\" He became an apprentice to an apothecary Charles Feltham in London on 5 June 1677, and was made a freeman of the Society of Apothecaries on 6 October 1685, later supplying medicine to St. Bartholomew's Hospital.Guildhall Library, London MS 8200/2. In 1692 he set up his apothecary practice at \\"at the sign of the white cross\\" on Aldersgate and lived in London for the rest of his life. His interest in natural history may have come from herbalizing visits to the garden of the Society for Apothecaries or at Fulham Palace. Early naturalist influences included John Watts and fellow apothecary Samuel Doody. The Temple Coffee House Botany Club, an informal group set up around 1689 by several people, including Dr Hans Sloane, was a place of botanical discussion. By 1691, the club included Martin Lister, Tancred Robinson, John Watts, Nehemiah Grew, William Sherard, Samuel Doody, Leonard Plukenet, Charles Hatton, Adam Buddle, and Samuel Dale. Petiver began to collect objects of natural history through his networks and his office became a centre for visiting travellers and collectors. Collectors and correspondents included Rev. John Banister from Virginia, Samuel Browne in Madras, surgeon Edward Bartar in Africa, John Smyth in Jamaica, and John Dickinson in Bermuda. In 1695 he published a catalogue, the first of many, of his collections as Musei Petiverani Centuria Prima Rariora Naturae Continens. He managed numerous specimens received by post and was routinely sending collection instructions to his correspondents (he had nearly 80 in America). One visitor, Zacharias von Uffenbach, noted that his specimens were poorly documented and heaped into a cabinet unworthy of display. In 1700 he was appointed as Apothecary to the Charterhouse. Patrick Blair promoted Petiver's publications in Scotland. Petiver himself did not travel much with visits restricted to Bristol and Cambridge and in 1711 to the Netherlands. He was known for his administrative ability which he extended to the Royal Society to which he (along with Samuel Doody) was elected in 1695 and Society of Apothecaries. He never married and was found dead around 2 April 1718 (incorrectly noted as 20 April in some sources) after a long illness. His body was taken on 10 April, the pallbearers included Sir Hans Sloane, Dr Levit and four other physicians and was buried at St Botolph Church on Aldersgate. Scientific work Petiver made use of a global network of collectors who worked aboard colonial trading ships and naval vessels, about a quarter to a third of his collectors were associated with the global slave trade. The collection that Petiver amassed was the largest natural history collection in his time. Petiver visited the Netherlands in 1711 on behalf of Sloane to study the collections of the Dutch entomologist Paul Hermann. He also met Boerhaave and other Dutch naturalists of the period and received an honorary degree from the University of Leiden. He recorded many English folk- names for butterflies, also coining some himself, and wrote some of the first butterfly books that used English names in addition to Latin. He himself was not very proficient in Latin although he was a member of several scholarly societies and an educated gentleman. He named the white admiral butterfly, and gave the name fritillary to another group of butterflies after the Latin word for a chequered dice box. He called skippers \\"hogs\\", swallowtails \\"Royal Williams\\", walls as \\"Enfield Eyes\\" and marbled whites as \\"Half-Mourners\\". Petiver received many specimens, seeds and much other material from overseas correspondents including Samuel Browne and Edward Bulkley in Madras, Jezreel Jones in Barbary, and the Czech Jesuit Georg Joseph Kamel in Manila. Petiver traded these specimens, often at exorbitant prices. From 1709 he used his position in the Society of Apothecaries to use the Chelsea botanic garden for his personal gain. After his death, his collections went to his sister Jane Woodstock and were purchased by Sir Hans Sloane for ¬£4000, and some of it is now in the Natural History Museum in London. Sloane found the condition of Petiver's collections appalling on purchase in 1718.

It was the site in 1813 of an American victory in the Battle of Fort Stephenson during the War of 1812. The town that later developed here was first named by settlers as \\"Lower Sandusky\\", as it was located near the falls of the lower river; it was renamed as Fremont, Ohio. It developed around the fort and a historic Wyandot village known as Junquindundeh. History The historic Wyandot village known as Junquindundeh developed at the falls of the Lower Sandusky River. Later European-American colonists also settled here, as ships could not navigate above this point. Fort Stephenson, first called Fort Sandusky, was constructed here in the early 1800s. It had two blockhouses connected by a palisade stockade of vertical logs. Another blockhouse was located within the fort. It was intended to protect the Lower Sandusky and a nearby supply depot during the War of 1812 with Great Britain. The United States expected attacks from along Lake Erie and Canada. In 1812 US Major George Croghan was assigned as commandant of a garrison of about 150-160 men. = Battle of Fort Stephenson = On August 1, 1813 a mixed force of British soldiers and allied Native American warriors, said to number 1500 to 2000, led an assault on Fort Stephenson. Over the course of two days, the severely outnumbered garrison of about 160 men, under the leadership of Major George Croghan, repelled all probes by strategically using their marksmanship and a single cannon, dubbed \\"Old Betsy.\\" The British forces returned the next day but were again unsuccessful in breaching the fort. The British general did not want to lay siege and withdrew his forces to Canada. = Legacy = After the US army withdrew from the fort, it deteriorated, and settlers helped themselves to the wood. By the late 19th century, there was little left but the stone retaining walls and Old Betsy. The city and state established what is now Fort Stephenson State Park on the site of the former fort to preserve its remains and commemorate the victory of the Battle of Fort Stephenson. The cannon known as \\"Old Betsy\\" is chained off overlooking the northern approach to the site. The main branch of Birchard Public Library was constructed in the Park in 1878, according to the terms of the bequest by Sardis Birchard that endowed the facility. This library serves all of Sandusky County. The city established recognition and celebration of Major Croghan by designating a \\"Croghan's Day\\". The Sandusky County Soldiers Monument was unveiled in the Park on \\"Croghan's Day\\", 1885. Former President Rutherford B. Hayes presided over the event. Additional commemoration followed on Croghan's Day in 1906, when the remains of Col. George Croghan were reinterred below the soldiers' monument. (They had been transported from his family cemetery in Kentucky.) The Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) had also arranged to add an historic plaque commemorating his leadership and his garrison's achievement to the Soldiers Monument. The cast bronze plaque is affixed to the pink granite stone of the monument. It reads: > \\"Fort Stephenson most gallantly defended by Major George Croghan with but > 160 men against 1300 British and Indians under Henry Proctor and Tecumseh on > August 2, 1813 ___ This tablet erected by Col. George Croghan Chapter > Daughters of the American Revolution 1903.\\" (Sic) The monument is located in front of the library's entrance on Croghan Street, which was named for the officer. He was promoted to Lt. Colonel for his success in the battle. ReferencesFurther reading *Hurt, R. Douglas. The Ohio Frontier: Crucible of the Old Northwest, 1720-1830.

Language Ngunnawal, or Gundungurra, is an Australian Aboriginal language, the traditional language of the Ngunnawal and Gandangara peoples. There are contradictory claims as to whether they are one language or two. The name Burragorang is applied to either. A dialect of the Gundungurra or Burragorang people is classified, together with Ngarigo, as one of several southern tableland languages of New South Wales. Country Map of the traditional lands of the Ngunnawal peoples of New South Wales. When first encountered by European settlers in the 1820s, the Ngunnawal speaking indigenous people were called the Yass Blacks, and lived around there around and to its north. Their tribal country according to the early ethnographer, R. H. Mathews stated their country extended from Goulburn to Yass and Burrowa southwards as far as Lake George to the east and Goodradigbee to the west. To the south of Lake George was the county of the Nyamudy speaking a Ngarigo dialect. Recent research by Harold Koch (2011) and others shows that the Ngunnawal country was primarily the land surrounding the Yass River extending between Lake George to the east and the Murrumbidgee to the west, while the southern boundary of the Ngunnawal people was north of Canberra, approximately on a line from Gundaroo to Wee Jasper. Sometimes the whole of the Burragorang language speaking area as far north as near Young is included as Ngunnawal, giving them a population in the 1830s of well over a thousand people. A major battle for ownership of the country was fought at Sutton between an invading Ngunnawal band and the Nyamudy inhabitants, which the latter won, establishing the Ngunnawal country, which did not extend further south along the Yass River than Gundaroo. People When first encountered by European settlers in the 1820s, the Ngunnawal speaking people were called the Yass Blacks or Yass mob with a reputation for hostility. The Ngunnawal people were northern neighbours of the Nyamudy/Namadgi people who lived to the south on the Limestone Plains. The Wiradjuri (to the west) and Gundungurra (to the north) peoples also bordered the Ngunnawal. However an alternative view is that the Ngunnawal people were not a people but the southern dialect of the Wallaballoa clan whose territory extended north from Yass to north of Borrowa. The 'Black Yass tribe' gradually merged with the European settlers, and by 1890 there were no full-blooded people. The mixed race people primarily lived in or close to the town of Yass. Between 1920 and 1930 some of those people left to live in Canberra so that they could work in the rapidly developing city, which had been first settled by Europeans a hundred years earlier, when it was populated by the Nyamudy/Namadgi tribe who spoke a Ngarigo dialect. Once there some lived in communities calling themselves Ngunnawal, a 'new tribe', although they only spoke English and were mainly descended from European settlers. Dispute over the traditional ownership of Canberra and the surrounding region At present, three groups contest ownership in the Canberra area: the Ngambri, the Ngarigo, and the Walgalu speaking Ngambri-Guumaal, represented by Shane Mortimer, with widespread connections from across the Snowy Mountains down to the Blue Mountains. According to settlers living in the area in the 1830s, such as quoted in the Queanbeyan Age, there were three groups in the region: the Yass Blacks (Ngunnawal), the Limestone Blacks (Nyamudy/Namadgi) and the Monaro Blacks (Ngarigo). Battles for ownership of the territory took place at Goondaroo/Sutton with the Yass Blacks, and at Pialigo with the Monaro Blacks, in both cases the Nyamudy/Namadgi tribe won to retain the first ownership of the Canberra district. The present dispute originated when the Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory at the time, Jon Stanhope, inaccurately stated that \\"Ngambri is the name of one of a number of family groups that make up the Ngunnawal nation.\\" He went on to say that \\"the Government recognises members of the Ngunnawal nation as descendants of the original inhabitants of this region.\\" He made the error after talking with multiracial people of part Ngunnawal descent whose forebears had come from Yass in the 1920s to find work. In 2012 research for the ACT Government, \\"Our Kin, Our Country\\", found \\"there is no basis within the description of the country supplied by Tindale. The research confirmed that the language spoken in the Canberra region was a dialect of Ngarigu, 'related to but distinguishable from the dialects spoken at Tumut and Monaro'\\". The report stated that evidence gathered from the mid-1700s onward was too scant to support any family's claims to be original owners. Some Canberra-area people with part Aboriginal heritage in inland southeast Australia, including Matilda House, identify as Ngambri. Shane Mortimer defines himself as one of the Ngambri-Guumwaal, Guumwaal being a language name said to mean \\"high country\\". This claim to be a distinct nation is disputed by many other local Aboriginal people who say that the Ngambri are a small family who took their name from the Sullivan's Creek area located to the east of Black Mountain in the late 1990s. There are others, whose relatives are mainly European, but in small part are Aboriginal descended from the Yass Blacks, who identify themselves as English Ngunnawal. Native title The earliest direct evidence for Indigenous occupation in the area comes from a rock shelter near the area of Birrigai near Tharwa, which has been dated to approximately 20,000 years ago. However, it is likely (based on older sites known from the surrounding regions) that human occupation of the region goes back considerably further. They were gradually displaced from the Yass area beginning in the 1820s when graziers began to occupy the land there. Some people worked at properties in the region. In 1826 many Aboriginal people at Lake George protested an incident involving a shepherd and an Aboriginal woman, though the protesters moved away peacefully. Historical records of Australia record the last full-blooded Ngunnawal person, Nellie Hamilton, dying in 1897. However, it has been regarded by some part Indigenous Australians as a biased attempt to claim that they were wiped out when there are many part Ngunnawal people still around today. Due to the lack of historical records, there has been little success in gaining native title in the Yass area, and no success in the ACT when the Ngunnawal, combined with Aboriginal people from other tribal connections, tried to recreate an Aboriginal presence.

The origin of the community is thought to be from the linen industry in the 19th century. The Church of Scotland parish church was built in 1861, and now shares a minister with nearby Ceres and Kemback. The church garden was originally intended to be a cemetery, but the high water table prevented this. The community is surrounded by fields; agriculture is still an important part of the economy of north east Fife (although few Springfield residents work in agriculture). After World War II, a considerable number of council houses were built in the village, creating new communities in Crawley Crescent, Tarvit Terrace and several other streets. Many of these local authority-owned houses have since been bought by their former tenants. One of the largest local employers is Stratheden Hospital, a psychiatric hospital located between Springfield and Cupar. Springfield has a pub, shop, parish church, village hall, primary school and a railway station on the Edinburgh to Aberdeen Line.

Biography According to Livy, Quintus was the only male to escape the slaughter of the gens Fabia at the Battle of the Cremera in 477 BC, since he was too young to be sent to war.Livy, 2.50. He was consul of the Roman Republic three times: # 467 BC, with Tiberius Aemilius L.f. Mamercinus (Mamercus) # 465 BC, with Titus Quinctius L.f. Capitolinus Barbatus # 459 BC, with Lucius Cornelius Ser.f. Maluginensis Uritus (Cossus) In his first consulship there was popular agitation for an agrarian law, which had been the cause of much social conflict at Rome for many years. Fabius successfully brought an end to the conflict by passing a law that the lands of the Volsci at the new Roman colony of Antium be distributed amongst the plebs. Three commissioners were named for the purpose of dividing the lands Titus Quintius, Aulus Virginius, and Publius Furius.Livy 3.1Livy III, 1.2-5Dionysius of Halicarnassus IX, 59.1-3 Also in 467 BC, Fabius led a Roman army against the Aequi. The Aequi sued for peace, which was granted, however the Aequi broke the peace shortly after with a raid into the Latin territory.Livy, 3.1. The following year Fabius was sent by the senate to demand restitution from the Aequi.Dionysius. ix. 60.3-6Livy. iii, 2.3Broughton, vol i, pp.33 In his second consulship in 465 BC Fabius was given a special command against the Aequi. He sought to persuade the Aequi to make peace, however the Aequi rejected that offer, and marched to Algidum. The Romans were so offended by the Aequian behaviour that the second consul Quinctius was sent with another Roman army against the Aequi. A battle was fought and the Romans were successful, following which the Aequi retreated to their own territory.Livy, 3.2 However the Aequi immediately returned to Latium and began pillaging the countryside. Fabius successfully ambushed the Aequi and routed them, recovering all the bounty that had been taken from the Latin territory. He then pursued the Aequi into their own territory and ravaged their lands, later returning to Rome with much bounty and glory.Livy, 3.3 The war would continue with the Aequi and in 462 BC, when both consuls were occupied with fighting both the Aequi and Volscians, Fabius was appointed as Praefectus urbi and given command in Rome.Livy, iii. 8.7, 9.6-9.13Dionysius, ix. 69.2Broughton, vol i, pp.36 During his third consulate, he besieged Antium and helped the Tusculans to rescue their city, which was occupied by the Aequi. In the end, he attacked the Aequi fleeing from Tusculum, killing many of them near Mount Algidus. In the following year, 458 BC, he was one of three ambassadors sent by the senate to demand recompense from the Aequi for the breaking of a treaty. Later in the year, during the dictatorship of Cincinnatus, Fabius was again appointed Praefectus urbi and held command in Rome.Livy. iii. 25.2-25.3, 29.4Dionysius. x. 22.4-24.1Broughton, vol i, pp.40 In 450 BC, Appius Claudius named him one of the second set of decemviri, ten men given absolute authority in Rome while they compiled the Law of the Twelve Tables. Livy says that Fabius was easily corrupted by Appius and he went from being a very good man to a very wicked one.Livy, 3.41.

A late starter in county cricket, having been told by his native county, Kent, that he would be better off taking up a career as a policeman, Wellard played on into his late 40s. He was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1936. Wellard was a fast-bowling all-rounder who exemplified much of the happy-go-lucky cricket played by Somerset in the 1930s. Despite a first-class batting average of only 19.72, he was famous for the number of sixes he hit, with over 500 in his career, accounting for a quarter of his runs. He was for many years the holder of the record number of sixes in a single season, with 72 in 1935. But Wellard as a fast bowler was good enough to be picked twice for England, against New Zealand in 1937 and against the Australians in 1938, and his 1,614 career wickets put him 63rd on the all-time bowling lists. Wellard was chosen in the England team to play three Tests in India in 1939-40, but the tour was cancelled due to the outbreak of World War II. Career Wellard's first- class debut came at the age of 25 for Somerset against the touring New Zealanders. A further tourists match against the West Indians followed the following season, but he was unable to appear in the County Championship until he was qualified in 1929. He took 125 wickets in his maiden season in the tournament, finishing behind only Jack White in the club's tally for the year. He took ten wickets in a match for the first time during his fourth County Championship match for Somerset against the visiting Kent side, with figures of 6/108 & 4/28. He took five-wicket hauls in four out of five innings at the beginning of June 1929, with five in the only innings against Derbyshire, six in the first innings against Leicestershire, and another six in the first innings followed by five in the second innings when Gloucestershire visited Taunton. On 24 August 1938, at Wells, Wellard thumped five sixes off an over from Kent's England allrounder Frank Woolley. This equalled a world record that lasted until Garry Sobers hit six sixes off Malcolm Nash in 1968. Wellard was well named: before Ian Botham struck 80 sixes in 1985, our Arthur was the only man to hit 50 in a season, which he did four times, including the round number of 66 sixes in 1935. Wellard played county cricket with Boss Meyer, the founder of Millfield School. Meyer was a well known eccentric and allegedly in 1947, Wellard who was even older than Meyer, was bowling rather well, when Northamptonshire batsman Dennis Brookes played a false stroke through the slips which Meyer, too crippled by lumbago to bend down, failed to catch. Meyer reached into his back pocket and said, \\"Sorry Arthur, here's a quid.\\" ReferencesExternal links  A tribute to Wellard Category:1902 births Category:1980 deaths Category:English cricketers Category:England Test cricketers Category:London Counties cricketers Category:Somerset cricketers Category:Wisden Cricketers of the Year Category:Players cricketers Category:English cricketers of 1919 to 1945 Category:H.

Born in Alabama and growing up in Ohio, Matthews joined the 10th Cavalry Regiment when he was only 15 years old, after having been recruited at a Lexington, Kentucky racetrack and having documents forged so that he appeared to meet the minimum age of 17. While stationed in Arizona, he joined General John J. Pershing's Mexico expedition to hunt down Mexican general Pancho Villa. He was later transferred to Virginia, where he took care of President Roosevelt and First Lady Eleanor's horses and was a member of the Buffalo Soldiers' drum and bugle corps. In his late 40s, he served in combat operations in the South Pacific during World War II and achieved the rank of first sergeant. He was noted as an excellent marksman and horse showman. Leaving the United States Army a few years before it was integrated, Matthews then took a job as a security guard in Maryland, rising to the rank of chief of the guards and then retiring in 1970. After the war, he told stories of military experiences and grew to become a symbol of the Buffalo Soldiers. In his later years he met with Bill Clinton and Colin Powell and also dedicated a barracks in Virginia in honor of the Buffalo Soldiers. Having experienced excellent health for most of his life, Matthews died of pneumonia at the age of 111 and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery. At the time of his death, he was recognized as the oldest living Buffalo Soldier as well as the oldest man, and the second-oldest person, in the District of Columbia. Early life Matthews was born in Greenville, Alabama and grew up in Mansfield, Ohio. His horse riding career began early, when he would deliver newspapers on the back of a pony. When he was only 15 years old, he met members of the 10th Cavalry, the original Buffalo Soldier unit, while tending to horses on a racetrack in Lexington, Kentucky. Although there is disagreement as to the origins of the name \\"Buffalo Soldiers,\\" it referred to several segregated units within the United States army. Although the legal age of recruitment was 17 at the time, documents were forged and Matthews signed up to join the army in Columbus, Ohio. Military career After his training, Matthews was first stationed in Fort Huachuca in Arizona. At the time, the army was still using Native Americans as guides in the western United States. During his tenure in the state, he was regarded as an excellent marksman. Next, he joined General John J. Pershing's campaign into Mexico in 1916 to hunt for Pancho Villa. Although Matthews admitted to never having met Villa, he would claim that \\"I knew where he was at.\\" During World War I, the battlefields of Europe were not conducive to cavalry; the 10th Regiment performed duty on the border with Mexico, including skirmishes with Mexicans and their German military advisors in the vicinity of Nogales, Arizona. In 1931, he was transferred to Fort Myer in Virginia. While stationed there, Matthews and some of his troops were escorts for King George VI and his wife Queen Elizabeth when they came to visit President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the White House. He earned acclaim for his horse shows, which helped sell war bonds during World War II and he tended to First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt's personal horses. He also played on the polo team while stationed in the state. He was also a member of the Buffalo Soldiers' drum and bugle corps, and performed at funerals in Arlington National Cemetery, where he himself would later be buried. Since the Army would not allow colored soldiers to be seen at white funerals at this time, he was forced to hide in the woods while playing \\"Taps\\". A decade later, he fought in World War II and saw combat action at the Battle of Saipan in the South Pacific. During the conflict, he rose to the rank of First Sergeant. He had originally been sent to train with the Tuskegee Airmen, but was deemed to be too old at the time. Later life Grave at Arlington National Cemetery Although there were conflicting reports on whether he retired from the Army in 1947, 1949 or 1950, he left the army only shortly before the Buffalo Soldiers were disbanded as part of President Harry S. Truman's initiative to integrate the Army. His next job was at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda where he worked as a security guard. By the time he retired for a second time, in 1970, he had become the chief of the guards at the institution. He spent much of his spare time fishing, reading the Bible, and recounting tales of his extensive military experiences, which made him a popular and respected figure within the community. His wife of 57 years, Genevieve Hill Matthews, died in 1986 and one of his daughters, Shirley Ann, died two years later. In his old age, he became a symbol for the Buffalo Soldiers. In 1994, he met with President Bill Clinton at the White House. In 1997, at the age of 103, Matthews was present at Arlington National Cemetery for a service honoring the Buffalo Soldiers, where he unveiled a plaque that dedicated his former barracks in honor of the soldiers. For his 108th birthday in 2002, he met with then-United States Secretary of State Colin Powell, where Powell was presented with a portrait of Matthews. He was a member of his local church, a Prince Hall Masonic Temple and the Washington chapter of the 9th and 10th Cavalry Association until his death. Although partially blind from glaucoma by the age of 109 and completely blind from cataracts by 111, he nevertheless retained his memory and good health until his final days; his medical history showed no signs of high blood pressure, heart or kidney trouble or diabetes. He was able to walk without a cane or walker, preferring not to use one, and was able to feed himself, including Cheerios for breakfast, his favorite vanilla ice cream with his other meals and a daily can of Ensure for energy. While he enjoyed recounting tales from his military experience, he never complained about the segregated nature of his unit, preferring instead to focus on his own exploits on the job. Matthews died at the claimed age of 111 of pneumonia in Washington, D.C. At the time of his death, he was recognized as the oldest living former Buffalo Soldier, the oldest man in Washington and the second oldest person in Washington overall behind then oldest American Corinne Dixon Taylor. He was survived by three of his four daughters, his son, nine grandchildren and seventeen great- grandchildren. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery in September 2005 and Washington, D.C. Mayor Anthony A. Williams spoke at his funeral, which was also attended by councilman and future mayor Adrian Fenty.

History Radio Rediffusion was officially founded in 1949 as a highly successful wired radio station run by the Rediffusion company. The radio service was highly successful with its main competitor Commercial Radio. Some of the early contents included plays, stories, concerts and Cantonese operas. The broadcasts were some of the main attraction in Hong Kong tea shops. One of the most famous broadcasters was Li Ngaw: another was Uncle Ray, the pioneering DJ. It later became a subscription cable television station on 29 May 1957, becoming the first television station in a colony of the British Empire, as well as the first television station in a predominantly Chinese city. It initially offered a four-hour-per-day English language and Chinese language service. The installation fee during its launch was HK$25, with an equipment rental fee of $45, and a monthly subscription charge of $36. The charge was considered expensive, at a time when the average worker in Hong Kong earned HK$100 per month. Hong Kong tea shops once again provided an outlet for the broadcasts to the working class who could not afford the subscription fees. When competitor TVB made its first free-to-air broadcast on 19 November 1967, RTV had 67,000 subscribers. It was renamed Rediffusion Television Limited (RTV; ) on 1 June 1973 when it was granted its free-to-air terrestrial broadcasting license. Cable television broadcasts were ceased thereafter.

The dam was the first and uppermost of several large-scale dams to be built on the Euphrates by Turkey. Although the Keban Dam was not originally constructed as a part of the Southeastern Anatolia Project (GAP), it is now a fully integrated component of the project, which aims to stimulate economic development in Southeastern Turkey. Construction of the dam commenced in 1966 and was completed in 1974. Keban Dam Lake (), the reservoir created by Keban Dam, has a surface area of and is reputedly the fourth-largest lake in Turkey after Lake Van, Lake Tuz, and the reservoir created by the Atat√ºrk Dam. Project history Construction of the Keban Dam was first proposed in 1936 by the newly established Electric Affairs Survey Administration, but not started before 1966. Construction was carried out by the French-Italian consortium SCI-Impreglio and completed in 1974. Estimates of the total construction cost vary between US$85 million and US$300 million. At that time, archaeological rescue missions had also been carried out at important sites that were to be flooded. Flooding of the reservoir started in 1974 and led to the displacement of 25,000 people. During the flooding of the Keban Reservoir, Turkey maintained the discharge of the Euphrates at per second, as agreed with the downstream countries of Syria and Iraq. However, as a result of the fact that Syria was at that time filling the reservoir of its newly constructed Tabqa Dam as well, in 1975 a dispute broke out between Syria and Iraq over the amount of water that flowed into Iraq. This dispute, exacerbated by drought which reduced the amount of available water even further, was solved by mediation of Saudi Arabia. After the initial filling of the lake, geological weaknesses in the bedrock on which the dam was built necessitated a temporary lowering of the lake level in order to carry out extensive reinforcement works. Reportedly, Keban Dam was the world's eighteenth-tallest dam at completion, creating Turkey's largest man-made reservoir and third-largest lake until the filling of the reservoir of the Atat√ºrk Dam. The construction of the dam and its subsequent reservoir resulted in involuntary resettlement of approximately 25,000 people.Bogumil Terminski, Development-Induced Displacement and Resettlement: Theoretical Frameworks and Current Challenges, Geneva, 2013; Bogumil Terminski, Development-Induced Displacement and Resettlement: Causes, Consequences and Socio-Legal Context, Ibidem Press, Stuttgart, 2015. =Archaeological rescue work= From 1968 to 1974, the Euphrates and Murat river valleys were the scene of intense archaeological survey and excavation in advance of flooding. The lake formed by the dam is mostly narrow, hemmed in by deep rock valleys. No archaeological sites were found in the survey of these valleys. The Murat valley opens up in two places, and it is here that archaeological (and modern) settlement was concentrated. The A≈üvan region, covering about , contained eleven archaeological sites, all relatively small. The largest, A≈üvan Kale, covered about in total; this site, as well as three others were excavated by the British Institute of Archaeology at Ankara: Ta≈ükun Mevkii, √áayboyu and Ta≈ükun Kale. The other broadening of the valley, at the Altƒ±nova plain (Elazig Province), was a well-defined area of thick and fertile alluvial soil. Archaeological survey located 36 sites, of which one, Nor≈üuntepe, covered , being by far the largest site in the region. It was excavated by a German team led by Harald Hauptmann. The Altƒ±nova plain contained other relatively large mounds, including Tepecik (), Korucutepe (), Deƒüirmentepe () and K√∂rtepe (). The late Roman Karamagara Bridge, a notable example of an early pointed arch bridge, has been permanently submerged by the dam. The area of rescue excavations is well covered in the work by Fahri Dikkaya.Fahri Dikkaya (2003), Settlement Patterns of Altƒ±nova in the Early Bronze Age. academia.edu; (PDF version) Characteristics of the dam and the reservoir The Keban Dam is a combined rockfill and concrete gravity hydroelectric dam operated by the State Hydraulic Works (DSƒ∞). The dam is long and its crest is above the level of the river-bed ( above sea-level). Its eight water turbines are capable of producing 1,330 MW. The storage capacity of Lake Keban is and the surface area of the lake is , although the lake has reportedly reached higher levels in the past. Due to Lake Keban's relatively high elevation at above sea-level and its location in an area with high precipitation, evaporation is relatively low at per year compared to reservoirs in Syria or Iraq. Apart from the Euphrates Valley directly upstream of the dam, the lake has also flooded parts of valleys of the Murat River and the Karasu, the two rivers from which the Euphrates emerges. Although the dam was not originally intended for irrigation, of agricultural land was irrigated from Lake Keban in 1999.

It is mostly used for general aviation; scheduled passenger jet service operated by Allegiant Air nonstop to Las Vegas was discontinued in October 2012. The airport also formerly was served by commercial flights non-stop to Chicago Rockford International Airport by Elite Airways. The airport is situated west of Interstate 25 and Denver is located about south. It is most notable for serving the tourist areas of northern Colorado, such as the Rocky Mountain National Park, which is situated directly west of the airport. FNL primarily serves the Fort Collins‚ÄìLoveland Metropolitan area located in Larimer County. The population for the metropolitan area is approximately 300,000. As per Federal Aviation Administration records, the airport had 31,094 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 31,079 enplanements in 2009, and 35,671 in 2010. It is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011‚Äì2015, which categorized it as a primary commercial service airport.  History  FNL opened in 1964 under joint agreement and ownership by Loveland and Fort Collins. The construction of the airport followed a significant rise in Colorado State University's (CSU) enrollment due to the civil rights movement. The name was officially changed by the Northern Colorado Regional Airport Commission at the regular Commission meeting on April 27, 2016 to the Northern Colorado Regional Airport to better reflect the area served by the airport.  Operation and management  FNL is jointly (50/50) owned and operated by the two cities of Loveland and Fort Collins. This means that it is publicly owned by the cities and follows a municipal structure. The Northern Colorado Regional Airport Commission provides direction for airport staff and is made up of two mayors and two city managers (one from each city) and three at large citizen members. There is no airport authority, which means funding and decisions are made on behalf of the two cities. However, to ensure proper balance in the decision-making process, the Commission is required to communicate with both city councils and involve them in financial and development activities that occur outside of the councils' approved standard form. This was changed under the amended and restated Intergovermental Agreement dated June 7, 2016. The airport manager at FNL is Jason Licon, who previously served 10 years as airport manager for the Kankakee Valley Airport Authority in Kankakee, Illinois.  Facilities and aircraft  Northern Colorado Regional Airport covers an area of 1,065 acres (431 ha) at an elevation of 5,016 feet (1,529 m) above mean sea level. It has two runways with asphalt surfaces: 15/33 is and 6/24 is . For the 12-month period ending January 1, 2012, the airport had 107,360 aircraft operations, an average of 294 per day: 96% general aviation, 3% air taxi, 1% scheduled commercial, and <1% military. At that time there were 237 aircraft based at this airport: 89% single-engine, 5% helicopter, 3% jet, 3% multi-engine, and <1% glider. On October 2, 2015, the Federal Aviation Administration announced that the airport would be used as a test facility for a remote air traffic control tower. This uses sensors and cameras that are operated remotely. The cost for this test phase was quoted at , paid for by the Colorado Aviation Fund, and unanimously passed by the board of the Colorado Division of Aeronautics.

The airline said it was due to an \\"internal business decision\\" to airport officials for a period of several months. In late September 2012, at a Texas airline conference, Allegiant CEO Maurice Gallagher told a reporter from Las Vegas, Nevada that the airline left because the airport had no control tower.

History  Clwb Ifor Bach has existed since 1983 and was founded by Cymdeithas Clwb Cymraeg Caerdydd, a society formed with the purpose of establishing a Welsh language social club. The new venue was created inside a former British Legion club on Womanby Street. The chair was Welsh politician Owen John Thomas. The club is named for Ifor Bach, a famous rebel leader against English rule in the 12th century. In 2017 planning permission was granted to create a hotel opposite the club and planning permission was also submitted to build six apartments next door. With worries that complaints about noise would threaten Clwb Ifor Bach's existence, a 'Save Womanby Street' campaign was launched. Following support from Cardiff Council and the local MP, plans for the flats were withdrawn in September. The Welsh Government said it would consider new planning laws to protect music venues.  The building  The club is contained within an unassuming three- storey building. There is a bar, stage and dance floor on each level, varying in size from level to level. The top floor is the largest. The physical fabric of the club underwent a fairly major overhaul in the 1990s. In early 2019 Clwb Ifor Bach announced plans to take over the derelict site next door to create new 500-capacity and 300-capacity venues. Cardiff Council had acquired the next door site and would lease it to the club. Designs are by architects Nissen Richards Studio.

The Roman dictator Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus turned an expected Roman defeat into an important victory. Background The government of Rome was already shared between the original Romans, the Latin and Sabine peoples. For example, the Quinctia gens, who had a major influence on Roman public life during this time, were of Latin origin. The Hernici were allied to Rome; the Etruscans were not impinging on the Romans, even though the Etruscan town of Veii was close to Rome. The greatest enemies of Rome at this time were the Volsci and the Aequi. The Volsci were based in territory to the southeast of Rome, while the Aequi were based to the east. The Aequi kept attacking Rome and its surroundings, either alone or with allies. In particular, the Aequi moved from the Apennine Mountains towards Tusculum. Their attacks disturbed trade and commercial communications along the Via Latina, as well as throughout Roman territory. The situation at Rome in this time was disturbing. There were conflicts between the Roman patricians and plebeians. There was also a revolt by the slaves of Rome. During the revolt, the Capitol was held by the slaves for a lengthy period, along with the most important temples of Rome. It was during this revolt that consul Publius Valerius Poplicola had died. The revolt ended only with the arrival of an army from Tusculum, led by the Tusculan dictator Lucius Mamilius. Meanwhile, Cincinnatus was appointed consul to replace Publicola. In 459 BC, the Aequi occupied Tusculum. In response to the threat, the Romans decided to send an army to help the allied city, under the command of the consul Lucius Cornelius Maluginensis. In addition, the consul Quintus Fabius Vibulanus, who was at that point besieging Antium, moved his forces to attack Tusculum. In the end, the Tusculans were able to recapture their city, with Vibulanus killing many Aequi near Mount Algidus. A truce was then arranged with the Aequi. The following year, 458 BC, the Aequi broke the truce. They attacked Tusculum again, and camped near Algidus; at the same time, a Sabine army moved against Rome. Two Roman armies were formed in haste: the consul Gaius Nautius Rutilus planned to move against the Aequian territories, while his colleague, Lucius Minucius Esquilinus Augurinus, planned to move against the Aequi camped near the mountain.Livy, iii. 25.Dionysius, x. 22. Minucius did not attack the Aequi, who by nightfall had started to build a fortification all around the Roman camp.Livy, iii. 26. Since Nautius did not know how to handle the situation, Cincinnatus, whose brief term as consul had ended, was nominated dictator.Dionysius, x. 23. Battle Cincinnatus chose his magister equitum, and levied every available Roman in the Campus Martius, requiring them to bring food for five days, along with twelve valli. The vallus was the pole brought by each Roman soldier. Valli were used to build a protective wall around the camp; a requirement of twelve valli instead of one was unusual. The Roman army arrived at Mount Algidus by nightfall. Cincinnatus signalled to the besieged Romans that he had arrived, then ordered his men to build a wall all around the Aequi. The Aequi attacked Cincinnatus, but they were soon obliged to turn and face the Romans under Minucius, who had left their camp to aid their countrymen. At dawn, the wall around the Aequi was completed; Cincinnatus ordered his men, who had marched and worked for a whole day without rest, to attack the Aequi within the wall. The Aequi, unable to sustain a double attack, surrendered. Cincinnatus let all but the leaders of the Aequi go.Livy, iii. 28.Dionysius, x. 24. Aftermath The spoils from the sack of the Aequian camp were distributed among Cincinnatus' men, while the Romans who had fought under Minucius were poorly regarded, and Minucius himself was obliged to resign the consulship. The Aequian leaders were brought to Rome as prisoners, where Cloelius Gracchus, the Aequian commander, was paraded in Cincinnatus' triumphal procession. Cincinnatus resigned the dictatorship, having held it for just sixteen days. Lucius Mamilius, the Tusculan commander, was rewarded with Roman citizenship.Livy, iii. 29.Dionysius, x. 25.

The improvement of the worst-case delay is achieved by using several carry-skip adders to form a block-carry-skip adder. Unlike other fast adders, carry-skip adder performance is increased with only some of the combinations of input bits. This means, speed improvement is only probabilistic. Single carry-skip adder The worst case for a simple one level ripple-carry adder occurs, when the propagate-condition is true for each digit pair (a_i, b_i). Then the carry-in ripples through the n-bit adder and appears as the carry-out after \\\\tau_{CRA}(n) \\\\approx n \\\\cdot \\\\tau_{VA}. Full adder with additional generate and propagate signals. For each operand input bit pair (a_i,b_i) the propagate-conditions p_i = a_i \\\\oplus b_i are determined using an XOR-gate. When all propagate-conditions are true, then the carry-in bit c_0 determines the carry-out bit. The n-bit-carry-skip adder consists of a n-bit-carry-ripple-chain, a n-input AND-gate and one multiplexer. Each propagate bit p_i, that is provided by the carry-ripple- chain is connected to the n-input AND-gate. The resulting bit is used as the select bit of a multiplexer that switches either the last carry-bit c_n or the carry-in c_0 to the carry-out signal c_{out}. * s = p_{n-1} \\\\wedge p_{n-2} \\\\wedge \\\\dots \\\\wedge p_1 \\\\wedge p_0 = p_{[0:n-1]} This greatly reduces the latency of the adder through its critical path, since the carry bit for each block can now \\"skip\\" over blocks with a group propagate signal set to logic 1 (as opposed to a long ripple-carry chain, which would require the carry to ripple through each bit in the adder). The number of inputs of the AND-gate is equal to the width of the adder. For a large width, this becomes impractical and leads to additional delays, because the AND-gate has to be built as a tree. A good width is achieved, when the sum-logic has the same depth like the n-input AND-gate and the multiplexer. 4 bit carry-skip adder. =Performance= The critical path of a carry-skip-adder begins at the first full-adder, passes through all adders and ends at the sum-bit s_{n-1}. Carry- skip-adders are chained (see block-carry-skip-adders) to reduce the overall critical path, since a single n-bit carry-skip-adder has no real speed benefit compared to a n-bit ripple-carry adder. :\\\\tau_{CSA}(n) = \\\\tau_{CRA}(n) The skip-logic consists of a m-input AND-gate and one multiplexer. :T_{SK} = T_{AND}(m) + T_{MUX} As the propagate signals are computed in parallel and are early available, the critical path for the skip logic in a carry-skip adder consists only of the delay imposed by the multiplexer (conditional skip). :T_{CSK} = T_{MUX} = 2 D. Block-carry-skip adders 16-bit fixed-block- carry-skip adder with a block size of 4 bit. Block-carry-skip adders are composed of a number of carry-skip adders. There are two types of block-carry- skip adders The two operands A = (a_{n-1}, a_{n-2}, \\\\dots , a_1, a_0) and B = (b_{n-1}, b_{n-2}, \\\\dots , b_1, b_0) are split in k blocks of (m_{k}, m_{k-1}, \\\\dots , m_{2}, m_{1}) bits. * Why are block-carry-skip-adders used? * Should the block-size be constant or variable? * Fixed block width vs. variable block width =Fixed size block-carry-skip adders= Fixed size block-carry-skip adders split the n bits of the input bits into blocks of m bits each, resulting in k = \\\\frac{n}{m} blocks. The critical path consists of the ripple path and the skip element of the first block, the skip paths that are enclosed between the first and the last block, and finally the ripple-path of the last block. :T_{FCSA}(n) = T_{CRA_{[0:c_{out}]}}(m) + T_{CSK} + (k-2) \\\\cdot T_{CSK} + T_{CRA}(m) = 3 D + m \\\\cdot 2 D + (k-1) \\\\cdot 2 D + (m+2) 2 D = (2m + k) \\\\cdot 2 D + 5 D The optimal block size for a given adder width n is derived by equating to 0 :\\\\frac{d T_{FCSA}(n)}{d m} = 0 :2 D \\\\cdot \\\\left(2 - n \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{m^2} \\\\right) = 0 :\\\\Rightarrow m_{1,2} = \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{n}{2}} Only positive block sizes are realizable :\\\\Rightarrow m = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{n}{2}} =Variable size block-carry-skip adders= The performance can be improved, i.e. all carries propagated more quickly by varying the block sizes. Accordingly the initial blocks of the adder are made smaller so as to quickly detect carry generates that must be propagated the furthers, the middle blocks are made larger because they are not the problem case, and then the most significant blocks are again made smaller so that the late arriving carry inputs can be processed quickly. Multilevel carry-skip adders By using additional skip-blocks in an additional layer, the block-propagate signals p_{[i:i+3]} are further summarized and used to perform larger skips: :p_{[i:i+15]} = p_{[i:i+3]} \\\\wedge p_{[i+4:i+7]} \\\\wedge p_{[i+8:i+11]} \\\\wedge p_{[i+12:i+15]} Thus making the adder even faster. Carry-skip optimization The problem of determining the block sizes and number of levels required to make the physically fastest carry-skip adder is known as the 'carry-skip adder optimization problem'. This problem is made complex by the fact that a carry- skip adders are implemented with physical devices whose size and other parameters also affects addition time. The carry-skip optimization problem for variable block sizes and multiple levels for an arbitrary device process node was solved by Thomas W. Lynch. This reference also shows that carry-skip addition is the same as parallel prefix addition and is thus related to, and for some configurations identical to the Han‚ÄìCarlson, the Brent‚ÄìKung, the Kogge-Stone adder and a number of other adder types. Implementation overview Breaking this down into more specific terms, in order to build a 4-bit carry-bypass adder, 6 full adders would be needed. The input buses would be a 4-bit A and a 4-bit B, with a carry-in (CIN) signal. The output would be a 4-bit bus X and a carry-out signal (COUT). The first two full adders would add the first two bits together. The carry-out signal from the second full adder (C_1)would drive the select signal for three 2 to 1 multiplexers. The second set of 2 full adders would add the last two bits assuming C_1 is a logical 0. And the final set of full adders would assume that C_1 is a logical 1. The multiplexers then control which output signal is used for COUT, X_2 and X_3.

The carry-select adder is simple but rather fast, having a gate level depth of O(\\\\sqrt n). Construction The carry-select adder generally consists of ripple carry adders and a multiplexer. Adding two n-bit numbers with a carry-select adder is done with two adders (therefore two ripple carry adders), in order to perform the calculation twice, one time with the assumption of the carry-in being zero and the other assuming it will be one. After the two results are calculated, the correct sum, as well as the correct carry-out, is then selected with the multiplexer once the correct carry-in is known. The number of bits in each carry select block can be uniform, or variable. In the uniform case, the optimal delay occurs for a block size of \\\\lfloor \\\\sqrt n \\\\rfloor. When variable, the block size should have a delay, from addition inputs A and B to the carry out, equal to that of the multiplexer chain leading into it, so that the carry out is calculated just in time. The O(\\\\sqrt n) delay is derived from uniform sizing, where the ideal number of full-adder elements per block is equal to the square root of the number of bits being added, since that will yield an equal number of MUX delays. =Basic building block= 300px Above is the basic building block of a carry-select adder, where the block size is 4. Two 4-bit ripple carry adders are multiplexed together, where the resulting carry and sum bits are selected by the carry-in. Since one ripple carry adder assumes a carry-in of 0, and the other assumes a carry-in of 1, selecting which adder had the correct assumption via the actual carry-in yields the desired result. =Uniform-sized adder= 800px A 16-bit carry-select adder with a uniform block size of 4 can be created with three of these blocks and a 4-bit ripple carry adder. Since carry-in is known at the beginning of computation, a carry select block is not needed for the first four bits. The delay of this adder will be four full adder delays, plus three MUX delays. =Variable-sized adder= 800px A 16-bit carry-select adder with variable size can be similarly created. Here we show an adder with block sizes of 2-2-3-4-5. This break-up is ideal when the full- adder delay is equal to the MUX delay, which is unlikely. The total delay is two full adder delays, and four mux delays. We try to make the delay through the two carry chains and the delay of the previous stage carry equal. =Conditional sum adder= A conditional sum adder is a recursive structure based on the carry-select adder. In the conditional sum adder, the MUX level chooses between two n/2-bit inputs that are themselves built as conditional- sum adder. The bottom level of the tree consists of pairs of 2-bit adders (1 half adder and 3 full adders) plus 2 single-bit multiplexers. The conditional sum adder suffers from a very large fan-out of the intermediate carry outputs. The fan out can be as high as n/2 on the last level, where c_{n/2-1} drives all multiplexers from s_{n/2} to s_{n-1}. Combining with other adder structures The carry-select adder design can be complemented with a carry- lookahead adder structure to generate the MUX inputs, thus gaining even greater performance as a parallel prefix adder while potentially reducing area. An example is shown in the Kogge‚ÄìStone adder article.

Introduction The Brent‚ÄìKung adder is a parallel prefix adder (PPA) form of carry-lookahead adder (CLA). Proposed by Richard Peirce Brent and Hsiang Te Kung in 1982 it introduced higher regularity to the adder structure and has less wiring congestion leading to better performance and less necessary chip area to implement compared to the Kogge‚ÄìStone adder (KSA). It is also much quicker than ripple-carry adders (RCA). Ripple-carry adders were the initial multi-bit adders which were developed in the early days and got their name from the ripple effect which the carry made while being propagated from right to left. The time taken for addition was directly proportional to the length of the bit being added. This is reverse in Brent‚ÄìKung adders where the carry is calculated in parallel thus reducing the addition time drastically. Further work has been done on Brent‚ÄìKung adders and other parallel adders to reduce the power consumption and chip area as well as to increase the speed thus making them suitable for low-power designs. A Brent‚ÄìKung adder is a parallel adder made in a regular layout with an aim of minimizing the chip area and ease of manufacturing. The addition of n-bit number can be performed in time O(\\\\log_2 n) with a chip size of area O(n \\\\log_2 n), thus making it a good- choice adder with constraints on area and maximizing the performance. Its symmetry and regular build structure reduces costs of production effectively and enable it to be used in pipeline architectures. In parallel adders the critical path is decided by computation of the carry from least significant bit (LSB) adder to the most significant bit (MSB) adder, therefore efforts are in reducing the critical path for the carry to reach the MSB. Basic model outline In general, most of the adders use carry-in and the corresponding bits of two numbers (A and B) to get the corresponding sum bit and carry-out - with ripple carry adders taking O(n) time for carry to reach MSB. * Considering that A = an an-1 ‚Ä¶ a1 and B = bn bn-1 ‚Ä¶ b1 both be n-bit binary numbers. * With sum being S = sn+1 sn ‚Ä¶ s1 and carry generated in each stage C = cn ‚Ä¶ c0 will be carry-in to next stages. thumb * For RCA, c0 = 0, and i the sum bit and carry bit generated are ci = gi ‚à® (ai ‚àß ci-1) ‚à® (bi ‚àß ci-1), si = ai ‚äï bi ‚äï ci-1 for i = 1, 2, ‚Ä¶ n sn+1 = cn respectively. * It is possible to transform the above ripple carry into carry-lookahead (CLA) by defining the carry bit i as c0 = 0, ci = (ai ‚àß bi) ‚à® (pi ‚àß ci-1) where gi = ai ‚àß bi and pi = ai ‚äï bi for i = 1, 2, ‚Ä¶ n. p and g are known as carry propagate and carry generate. This corresponds to the fact that the carry ci is either generated by ai and bi or propagated from the previous carry ci-1. Brent and Kung further transformed the carry generation and propagation by defining an operator o as (a1, b1) o (a2, b2) = (a1 ‚à® (b1 ‚àß a2), b1 ‚àß b2). * They also defined a function (Gi, Pi) = (g1, p1) for i = 1; otherwise (gi, pi) o (Gi-1, Pi-1) for i = 2, 3, ‚Ä¶ n. It can be derived that Gi in the function is equivalent to ci. Also (Gn, Pn) can be non-recursively written as = (gn, pn) o (gn-1, pn-1) o ‚Ä¶ o (g1, p1). Taking advantage of the associativity of operator o (Gn, Pn) can be computed in a tree-like manner. The design of the white nodes is obvious as they are just buffering the gi's and pi's, and the black nodes are performing operation defined by operator o, which is similar to a one bit adder. * This tree-like propagation of carry reduces its critical path to that of tree height. As the carry tree height can be maximum of O(log_2(n)), the critical path of the Brent‚ÄìKung parallel adder is also O(log_2(n)), which is better than the normal adder performance of O(n). The tree-based layout also reduces the chip area and redundant wiring required in general CLA-based adders. Final processing stage Using the carry propagation and generation transformation for working out addition and carry used by Brent and Kung, the performance of the adder increases considerably and also leads to an increase in regularity. The final sum can be calculated as follows: si = pi ‚äï ci-1 Low-power adder The increase in performance in Brent‚ÄìKung adders is attributed to its tree structure of carry propagation which also leads to lower power consumption as the carry signal now has to travel through fewer stages, leading to less switching of transistors. Also, the decrease in amount of wiring and fan-out also contributes largely to its lower power consumption than CLA adders. A Brent‚ÄìKung adder can also be used in a pipeline manner which can further reduce the power consumption by reducing the depth of combinatorial logic and glitches stabilization. The graph shows a low-power Brent‚ÄìKung adder. Comparison with Kogge‚ÄìStone adderAdvantages= Due to this type of adder requiring fewer modules to implement than the Kogge‚ÄìStone adder, the Brent‚ÄìKung adder is much simpler to build. It also contains far fewer connections to other modules, which also contributes to its simplicity. =Disadvantages= One major disadvantage of this adder is fan-out. Fan-out may split and weaken the current propagating through the adder.

The movie starts with the suicide of the protagonist and uses reverse chronology to depict some of the key events of the past 20 years of his life that led to his death. It was the ninth highest grossing domestic film of 2000 with 311,000 admissions in Seoul. It was received well, especially in film festivals. Spurred by the success of Lee Chang-dong's directorial debut, Green Fish, Peppermint Candy was chosen as the opening film for the Busan International Film Festival in its first showing in 1999. It won multiple awards at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival and won the Grand Bell Awards for best film of 2000. Plot At the beginning, the main character Yong-ho wanders to a reunion of his old student group. After causing some general mayhem with his deranged antics, he leaves and climbs atop a nearby train track. Facing an oncoming train, he exclaims \\"I want to go back again!\\" What follows is a series of prior events in the main character's life that show how he became the suicidal man portrayed in this scene. The first flashback takes place only three days before Yong-ho's death. At this point he is already clearly suicidal, spending the last of his money on a gun and contemplates who he should use it on. After confronting his former business partner and ex-wife Hong-ja, the husband of his teenage crush Sun-im pays him a surprise visit. Yong-ho is taken to visit a comatose Sun-im in a hospital, and presents some peppermint candies she used to give him. The next flashback shows Yong-ho's life five years earlier. At first glance, he seems to be a rather successful businessman, but the problems in his life become clear when he confronts his wife, who is having an affair with her driving instructor. Yong-ho is unable to claim moral high ground, since he is also shown having an affair, with an assistant from his workplace. Finally, Yong-ho is shown with his wife at their new house, having dinner with his colleagues, where it becomes apparent that the marriage isn't working. On the third flashback, Yong-ho is shown as a police officer in 1987. At the beginning, he is shown along with his pregnant wife at a mundane scene. After this, he is shown apprehending a witness and brutally torturing him for information about another man's whereabouts. This leads Yong-ho to Kunsan where he and his fellow police officers capture the wanted man. While in Kunsan, Yong-ho is distracted from his work by fruitlessly trying to search for Sun-im and instead ends up on a one-night stand with a woman. The following flashback shows Yong-ho when he is just starting his career as a policeman and is pressured by his peers to torture a crime suspect, presumably a student demonstrator. Shortly afterward, he is visited by Sun-im. Yong-ho coldly and cruelly dismisses her by feigning interest in another woman, his future wife Hong-ja. At the final scene of this sequence, Yong-ho is shown sleeping with Hong-ja, whom it is shown he never truly cared about. During the next flashback, it's May 1980 and Yong-ho is performing his mandatory military service. While Sun-im is trying to visit him, his company is taken to quell the Gwangju Democratization Movement. Yong-ho gets shot in the leg and is told to stay behind. This leads to a scene where he confronts a harmless and presumably innocent student, whom he accidentally shoots and kills. The last flashback shows Yong-ho as a part of the student group that reunited at the beginning of the movie. This is also where he meets Sun-im for the first time. The scene poignantly shows the innocence that Yong-ho had, before his country molded him into the violent and jaded man he is at the start of the film by pitting him against his friends. Analysis The events of Yong-ho's life that are shown in the movie can be seen as representing some of the major events of Korea's recent history. The student demonstrations of the early 1980s leading to the Gwangju massacre are shown, as Yong-ho becomes traumatized by the shooting incident. The tightening grip on the country by the military government during the 1980s is mirrored by Yong-ho losing his innocence and becoming more and more cynical during his stint as a brutal policeman. Similarly, Yong-ho losing his job during the late 1990s mirrors the Asian financial crisis. Yong-ho's life represents the struggle between historiography and psychoanalysis. Despite his desperate desire to move on from his past, mnemonic traces overpower the psychoanalytical aspects of his life. These mnemonic traces include the train, the camera, and the peppermint candy as well as Sun-im and her surrogates throughout the vignettes, which led the psychoanalysis of his life to triumph over historiography. The relationship between historiography and psychoanalysis can be seen in historicism and progressivism, where Yong-ho chooses to look back on his past instead of looking solely at his future to move forward. The major traumatic events that were historically imposed on him were so embedded in his life that he could not simply move on. However, finally reflecting back on his past allows him to accept what happened and finally advance into the future. Unfortunately, this was moments before he committed suicide when he turned to face the train. The train is the symbol that guides the film in reverse chronology, and his cry to return to the past signifies his tragically late recognition of the past's significance for his life. Issues of masculinity in South Korean culture arise in the film. Yong-Ho's masculinity is broken during the Gwangju Massacre scene in which the militarized masculinity enforced by the Korean government -- a required 26-month duty in the military, an order to kill innocent civilians, and a need to conform to the standards of the other soldiers around him -- ultimately force Yong-Ho to compensate later in life by interrogating the student protesters who inevitably were the reason he was put in that situation.Steve Choe, \\"Catastrophe and finitude in Lee Chang Dong's Peppermint Candy: temporality, narrative, and Korean history\\" This theme continues with the way he treats women later on in his life, objectifying and mistreating his wife Hong-ja and ultimately losing his one link back to his innocence, Sun-im. What results in the beginning of the film, which will be the end of Yong-Ho's life, is an ultimate humiliation and a lamentation for a lost innocence where personal history is connected with the history of South Korea.

Family Brother of Quintus Minucius Esquilinus Augurinus, consul in 457 BC, he was a member of the Minucii Augurini branch of the gens Minucia. Lucius was the son of a Publius Minucius and grandson of a Marcus Minucius. His complete name is Lucius Minucius P.f. M.n. Esquilinus Augurinus. CareerConsulship= In 458 BC, he was consul with Gaius Nautius Rutilus. Livy, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, and Diodorus Siculus called him consul ordinarius, but according to the Fasti Capitolini, he was the consul suffect, replacing a certain Carvetus who died at the beginning of his term. This year, Rome had faced an assault by the Aequi whose treaty had expired the year before and Roman territory was pillaged by the Sabines, reaching as far as the city walls. The consuls levied two armies, Augurinus alongside the dictator Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, named by consul Rutilus, who relinquished command of the army once the mission was accomplished, and returned power to the Senate.Livy, III. 25-29 Once back in Rome, Augurinus abdicated and command of his army was given to the praefectus Urbi, Quintus Fabius Vibulanus.Livy, III. 39Dionysius of Halicarnassus, X. 22-24 =Decemvirate= In 450 BC, Lucius was elected as member of the Second Decemvirate against more qualified candidates thanks to the supportive actions of Appius Claudius Crassus, who had been decemvir the year before. This commission achieved the writing of the Law of the Twelve Tables, but under the influence of Crassus, they despotically maintained power after the end of their mission.Livy, III. 35 In 449 BC, the decemvirs, led by Crassus, illegally kept their power, against the will of the Senate and the people. The invasion of the Sabines and the Aequi had consequently dispersed the decemvirs. Quintus Fabius Vibulanus, Manius Rabuleius, and Quintus Poetelius Libo met the Sabines in battle while Lucius Minucius accompanied Marcus Cornelius Maluginensis, Lucius Sergius Esquilinus, and Titus Antonius Merenda in their fight with the Aequi. However, the army had revolted against the decemvirs, and the plebeians had left the city en masse for Aventine Hill. Lucius Minucius and his colleagues acquiesced and gave up their power - some left in exile. Their goods were confiscated.Livy, III. 40 =Prefect of the corn-market= In 440 BC, a great famine had reached Rome. Given the urgency of the situation, the consuls had quickly elected a praefectus annonae crearetur (\\"Prefect of the Corn-market\\"),Livy, Ab urbe condita, IV. 12 some sort of prefect of the Republic's corn supply, whose purpose it was to secure the grain supply. It was probably this year that the aedile of the plebs, Manius Marcius, organized a distribution of grain for the plebs, where each individual was given one-third of a Roman bushel (modius). The example of Manius Marcius was soon followed by Spurius Maelius, a rich member of the Equestrian order, who had acquired great quantities of fresh wheat in Etruria, and then distributed it to the people for free. His popularity became such that the Patricians were convinced that he was only trying to gain support in order to become king. He had already taken measures for a coup. In the meantime, Lucius Minucius had informed Titus Quinctius Capitolinus Barbatus, and Agrippa Menenius Lanatus, who were elected consuls for the year 439 BC, and named Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus dictator at the start of their term. Cincinnatus had Spurius Maelius assassinated by his magister equitum, Gaius Servilius Ahala.Livy, Ab urbe condita, IV. 13 According to ancient authors, Lucius Minucius was rewarded with the erection of a statue for having alerted the patricians to the danger that Spurius Maelius posed.Livy, Ab urbe condita, IV. 13-16Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, XII. 1-2 ReferencesBibliography * Category:Roman Republican consuls Augurinus Esquilinus, Lucius Category:5th-century BC Romans Category:Ancient Roman decemvirs ","title":"Lucius Minucius Esquilinus Augurinus"},{"id":"2737779","text":"Rattle is a hamlet in the English county of Derbyshire.

Rombouts and Th. van Lerius, De liggeren en andere historische archieven der Antwerpsche sint Lucasgilde van 1453‚Äì1615, J. E. Buschmann, Antwerp, 1872‚Äì1876, p. 457 He left Antwerp for Paris in 1616, where he spent about two years in the workshop of Frans Pourbus the Younger, a prominent portrait painter from Antwerp.Justus Sustermans in the National Gallery of Art Systematic Catalogue Portrait of Galileo Galilei When Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany invited in 1620 a team of Flemish and French tapestry weavers from Paris to Tuscany, Suttermans joined them. The party likely reached Florence in October 1620. On 20 April 1621 he is first documented in Florence when the Compagnia dei SS Barbara e Quirino paid him for a painting of Saint Barbara. He is first recorded in the service of the Medici in October 1621. Suttermans gained this court appointment on the strength of a portrait of the one of the tapestry weavers, a painting identified as a portrait of Pietro F√©v√®re or Ebert d'Egidio van Asselt.Gaspard De Wit, Flemish Tapestry Weavers Abroad: Emigration and the Founding of Manufactories in Europe: Proceedings of the International Conference Held at Mechelen, 2‚Äì3 October 2000, Koninklijke Manufactuur van Wandtapijten, Leuven University Press, 2002, p. 165 As the Medici had many family connections with other courts in northern Italy and Austria, Sustermans often travelled to other cities in Italy as well as to Vienna. In 1620 to early 1621 he was active in Mantua, where his master Pourbus had been a court painter at the beginning of the century. He painted in Mantua portraits of Eleonora Gonzaga, who was Emperor Ferdinand II's future wife, of Caterina de' Medici, Duke Ferdinando Gonzaga's wife, and a miniature portrait of Caterina de' Medici. On 5 January 1622, he delivered his first surviving documented work for the Medici, a portrait of Maria Maddalena of Austria, the widow of Grand Duke Cosimo II (now in the Royal Museum of Fine Arts of Belgium Brussels). In 1623 and 1624 he worked in Vienna on commissions from the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II. He wrote a letter to the Emperor pleading for him and his brothers Jan, Nicolaes, Frans, Vincent and Cornelis to be raised to the nobility. He explained in the letter that he and his brothers had been called from Florence to put their art in the service of the Emperor. The Emperor elevated the brothers Sustermans, including a brother called Matthias not mentioned in Justus' letter, to the nobility in 1624.A. Hajdecki, 'Die Niederl√§nder in Wien', in: Oud-Holland 23 (1905), p. 1-26, 108-128, 25 (1907), p. 9-26, esp. 23 (1905), p. 6-9 His brother Jan may have assisted with some of the portraits of the imperial family that Justus painted in Vienna. He returned to Florence by 17 February 1625, when he enrolled in the Accademia del Disegno. He may have made another trip to Vienna in 1626. Portrait of Domenica delle Cascine, la Cecca di Pratolino and Pietro Moro He traveled to Rome with his brother Frans, where in 1627 he painted portraits of Pope Urban VIII and most of the cardinals at the Vatican. Other travels included a 1639 stay at the Farnese court in Parma where he would have seen the work of Correggio. He was in 1639‚Äì40 in Piacenza. In 1640 he worked in Milan for Don Diego Felipez de Guzm√°n, 1st Marquess of Legan√©s. He returned to Florence. He traveled to Rome in 1645 in the following of Cardinal Giancarlo de' Medici, the second son of Grand Duke Cosimo II. He painted portraits of Pope Innocent X and members of the Doria Pamphilj family. He was in Modena from June 1649 where he worked at the court of Francesco I d'Este. From there he was summoned to Genoa to work in the service of Giancarlo de' Medici. He is recorded making in November 1649 in Genoa a portrait of Maria Anna of Spain for Giancarlo. Here he would have seen van Dyck's portraits of Genoese patricians. He returned to Modena in November where he may have seen Vel√°zquez' Portrait of Duke Francesco (Galleria Estense, 1638). In Modena he also met Guercino. From there he returned to Florence in 1650 where he resided until 1653. That year he worked in Ferrara, Modena and Mantua. In the fall of 1654 he was back in Modena and in 1654 in Genoa. In the period from 1654 to 1681 he spent most of his time in Florence. He worked in 1656 in Mantua and Modena and at the end of that year and the next year in Innsbruck. While in Austria he may have visited his brothers Matthias, a court musician, and Cornelis, a painter. He worked again in Modena from June to October 1659. He may have worked for some time in Spain. Equestrian portrait of Ferdinando de' Medici He became friends with Rubens and van Dyck and maintained regular correspondence with them.Filippo Baldinucci, Notizie dei professori del disegno da Cimabue in qua per le quali si dimostra come, e per chi le belle arti di pittura, scultura e architettura, Volume 4, V. Batelli, 1846, pp. 473-488 He commissioned from Rubens in 1638 the painting Horrors of War (Florence, Pitti Palace) for his own collection. He operated a large workshop which produced many copies and variations of his paintings. Some of the collaborators in his workshop established a name for themselves including the brothers Valore and Domenico Casini, Valerio Marucelli, Francesco Bianchi Buonavita and Giovanni Lionardo Henner. These assistants likely painted the secondary details in his portraits. The important role played by the workshop in his output had a negative impact on his posthumous reputation. Sustermans married three times. He married first Dejanira di Santi Fabbretti, originally from Pisa. She died in August 1628 at the birth of their only son Carlo who later became a priest. In 1635 he married Maddalena di Cosimo Mazzocchi, from which union were born a son Francesco Maria and a daughter Vittoria. His son died in 1663. He married Maddalena Artimini in 1664 with whom he had another son and daughter. His nephew Giovanni Vangheldri (Jan van Gelder) (active 1651-1675), a son of his sister Clara Sustermans and merchant Johannes van Gelder, was a prominent portrait artist for the Dukes of Modena and Counts of Novellara. He likely joined his uncle Justus in Modena in 1649.Gli artisti italiani e stranieri negli stati estensi catalogo storico ... By Giuseppe Campori, pages 477.Jan van Gelder at the Netherlands Institute for Art History He died in Florence on 23 April 1681 and was buried in San Felice church. Work Sustermans is mainly known for his portrait paintings. He also painted a number of history and genre paintings, still lifes and animals. Portrait of Orazio Piccolomini, three-quarter-length, with a dog He rarely dated his works, which makes it difficult to establish a chronology. His works have been dated mainly by relying on the apparent age of identified sitters. His early portraits show the influence of his master Frans Pourbus the Younger whose courtly portrait style was known for accentuating attention to precious details as well as its hard modelling.Sustermans, Justus at Treccani Enciclopedia on line Sustermans did not share the Flemish preference for concentrating on the details of the sitters' clothes and rather favored a monumental simplicity in form. In Italy his style started to reflect the contact with Florentine painters such as Cristofano Allori and Domenico Passignano. An example is the Portrait of Fra' Francesco dell'Antella (private collection, before early 1623). His Maria Maddalena of Austria (Wife of Duke Cosimo II de' Medici) with her Son, the Future Ferdinand II (Flint Institute of Arts, 1623) shows his familiarity with the work of Scipione Pulzone, in particular his Portrait of Christine of Lorraine (Uffizi). The cloakroom of the Villa di Pratolino with hunters and cooks of the Medici family During his years in Vienna in 1623 and 1624 he painted in a more painterly style which possibly was under the influence of the works of Hans von Aachen and Josef Heintz. Later, his work became more Baroque, under the influence of Flemish painters such as Rubens, Antony van Dyck and Cornelis de Vos. His Portrait of Prince Waldemar Christian of Denmark (Galleria Palatina) shows the influence of Rubens. His mature style of the 1630s is characterised by its loose and expressive brushwork and lighter palette. The works of the Venetians such as Titian may have led to his lighter palette in the 1630s. Suttermans was for seven years in possession of Titian's Portrait of Pietro Aretino (Florence, Pitti), which was in the collection of the Medici. This work may have inspired his famous Portrait of Galileo Galilei (Uffizi Museum). It was commissioned by Elia Diodati, a jurist who lived between Paris and Geneva and was a good friend of Galileo. After Galileo's death, he donated the portrait to the Grand Duke Ferdinand II. The portrait is a half bust showing Galileo's face on which the light source falls and looking upwards outside the frame. At the time of the painting, Galileo was around 70 years old. The work is executed in a thickly painted texture similar to 16th- century Venetian painting.Justus Sustermans, Portrait of Galileo Galilei at Uffizi Galleries The presence of Pietro da Cortona in Florence from 1637 may have been another element in his stylistic evolution. From the mid 1640s he returned to his earlier handling of surfaces, with sharp contrasts between light and shadow. An example is the full-length Portraits of Vittoria della Rovere with the young Cosimo III de Medici (Museo Nazionale di Palazzo Mansi, 1646). Prince Valdemar, aged between 16 and 18 In the mid-50s there was a dip in the quality of his output. The reason behind this may have been an increased dependence on his workshop, either because Sustermans was regularly travelling or because of the Grand Duke's imposition of standard prices for anything other than full-length portraits. In the 1660s and 1670s his brushwork became more restrained and he often placed his figures against a dark background with rapid expert touches of highlight. = Selected works = *Portrait of a Lady, oil on canvas (Norton Simon Museum, Pasadena, California) *Portrait of a Lady Wearing Pearls , oil on canvas (Odessa Museum of Western and Eastern Art, Ukraine) *The Senators of Florence swearing Allegiance to Ferdinando II de‚ÄôMedici, oil on canvas, (Ashmolean, Oxford) *Portrait of Galileo Galilei, (shown at right) oil on canvas (National Maritime Museum, Greenwich) *Portrait of Galileo, oil on canvas (Uffizi Gallery, Florence) *Portrait of a Woman, oil on canvas (National Museum of Serbia), BelgradePortrait of a Woman, CulturalHeritage.cc Foundation, Accessed 8 October 2013. *Portrait of the Grand Duke Ferdinando II of Tuscany and his Wife Vittoria della Rovere, oil on canvas (National Gallery, London) *Vincenzo II Gonzaga, Ruler of Mantua from 1587‚Äì1612, Wearing the Order of the Redemeer, oil on canvas *Portrait of Cardinale Carlo de' Medici, oil on canvas (Museo Poldi Pezzoli, Milan) *Maria Maddalena of Austria, Wife of the Grand Duke Cosimo II de' Medici and Sister of the Emperor Ferdinand, with her son, the Future Ferdinand II, oil on canvas (Summerfield Gallery, Flint Institute of Art, Flint, Michigan) *The family of Darius in front of Alexander, (Biblioteca Museu V√≠ctor Balaguer, Vilanova i la Geltr√∫) ReferencesExternal links Category:Flemish Baroque painters Category:Flemish portrait painters Category:Flemish history painters Category:Flemish draughtsmen Category:Artists from Antwerp Category:1597 births Category:1681 deaths Category:Court painters ","title":"Justus Sustermans"},{"id":"2737804","text":"James Campbell is a British stand-up comedian.

He has released 10 studio albums on various labels, and has released 34 singles to country radio. Although he first charted on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart in 1988, he did not reach the top 40 for the first time until 1992's \\"Where Forever Begins\\", which peaked at number 40. McCoy broke through two years later with the back-to-back number one singles \\"No Doubt About It\\" and \\"Wink\\" from his platinum-certified album No Doubt About It. Although he has not topped the country charts since, his commercial success continued into the mid to late 1990s with two more platinum albums and a gold album, as well as six more top 10 hits. A seventh top 10 hit, the number 10 \\"Billy's Got His Beer Goggles On\\", came in 2005 from his self-released That's Life. Early life Hubert Neal McGaughey Jr. was born on July 30, 1958, in Jacksonville, Texas, to a Filipino American mother and Irish-American father. Inspired by the variety of music that his parents listened to, which included country, rock, disco and R&B;, McGaughey first sang in his church choir before founding an R&B; band. He later switched his focus to country music, performing in various bars and clubs in Texas. McGaughey, after attending junior college near his hometown, found work selling shoes at a shopping mall. In the early 1980s, he met his wife, Melinda, at the store. After winning a 1981 talent contest hosted by Janie Fricke, he secured a spot as an opening act for Charley Pride. Musical career Crediting himself as Neal McGoy, a phonetic spelling of his surname, he signed to the independent 16th Avenue Records label in 1988. He released the singles \\"That's How Much I Love You\\" and \\"That's American\\", and although the former reached No. 85 on the country charts, he did not release an album for the label. He continued to tour as an opening act for Pride until 1990, the same year that the 16th Avenue label closed. =1990‚Äì2000: Atlantic Records= He then signed to Atlantic Records in 1990, changing his surname to McCoy per the label's request, as fans had already begun to refer to him as McCoy. His debut album, At This Moment, was released that year. None of the three singles made the country Top 40, although the lead-off single \\"If I Built You a Fire\\" was a Top 20 country hit in Canada. The other two releases were the title track, a cover of Billy Vera and the Beaters' hit song from 1987, and \\"This Time I've Hurt Her More Than She Loves Me\\", which was co- written by Earl Thomas Conley and originally recorded by Conway Twitty. McCoy continued touring and developed a \\"reputation for exciting, freewheeling live shows.\\" A second album for Atlantic, Where Forever Begins, followed in 1992. This album produced his first American Top 40 country hit in its No. 40-peaking title track, followed by \\"There Ain't Nothin' I Don't Like About You\\" at No. 57, and \\"Now I Pray for Rain\\" at No. 26\\\\. The album was also his first entry on Top Country Albums, at No. 58\\\\. Working with producer Barry Beckett for the first time, McCoy released his breakthrough album, No Doubt About It, in 1994. The album produced his only number 1 country hits in its title track and \\"Wink\\", both of which also made minor entries on the Billboard Hot 100. The album also earned a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and gold certification from the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA). Its final single was \\"The City Put the Country Back in Me\\" at No. 5\\\\. =Mid-Late 1990s= You Gotta Love That, his fourth album, also received a platinum certification and it produced four singles: \\"For a Change\\", \\"They're Playin' Our Song\\" and the title track (respectively the first, second, and fourth singles) all peaked at No. 3, while \\"If I Was a Drinkin' Man\\" reached No. 16. McCoy's self-titled fifth studio album began a decline in his chart momentum. Although it was certified gold, Neal McCoy accounted for only one Top Ten hit in a cover of The Casinos' 1967 doo-wop single \\"Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye\\". The next two singles ‚Äî \\"Going, Going, Gone\\" and \\"That Woman of Mine\\" ‚Äî both peaked at No. 35\\\\. Also in 1996, he sang guest vocals on the multi-artist charity single \\"Hope\\", the proceeds of which went to the T. J. Martell Foundation's cancer research.Whitburn, p. 193 After \\"That Woman of Mine\\", he reached No. 5 with \\"The Shake\\", the only new song on his first Greatest Hits package, which reprised nine of his greatest hits to that point and also earned platinum certification. Be Good at It, his sixth studio release, followed in 1998. This was his first album since Where Forever Begins not to include a Top Ten hit. The title track, \\"If You Can't Be Good, Be Good at It\\", was the highest- peaking single release from it at No. 22, followed by \\"Party On\\", which became his first single since 1992 to miss Top 40 entirely. After it came the No. 29 \\"Love Happens Like That.\\" McCoy made a second appearance on a multi-artist charity single that same year, as one of several collaborators on \\"One Heart at a Time\\", a song written by Victoria Shaw to benefit cystic fibrosis research. In 1999, McCoy released his final album for Atlantic, The Life of the Party. It only accounted for two singles: the Phil Vassar co-write \\"I Was\\" at No. 37 and \\"The Girls of Summer\\" at No. 42\\\\. He, Tracy Byrd, and T. Graham Brown also sang guest vocals on \\"Now That's Awesome\\", a song featuring snippets of a Bill Engvall comedy sketch, found on Engvall's Now That's Awesome album. This single peaked at No. 59. =2000‚Äì04: Warner Bros. Records and SEA Records= Due to the closure of Atlantic Records' Nashville division in mid-2000, McCoy's next album, 24-7-365, was issued via Giant Records. It included the singles \\"Forever Works for Me (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday)\\", \\"Every Man for Himself\\", and \\"Beatin' It In\\", at No. 38, No. 37, and No. 41 respectively. In late 2000, he released a Christmas medley consisting of \\"I'll Be Home for Christmas\\" and \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\", which reached number 74 based on seasonal airplay. After Giant closed as well, he moved again to Warner Bros. Records, where he recorded The Luckiest Man in the World. Although the title track entered the country charts and peaked at number 46, the album itself was not released, and McCoy exited Warner Bros. by the end of the year. He signed with an independent label called SEA Records in 2004, and was slated to release a single for it in the middle of the year, but he left the label without releasing anything. =2005‚Äì07= In 2005, Neal McCoy and his manager Karen Kane founded a label called 903 Music. His first single for his own label was \\"Billy's Got His Beer Goggles On\\", which reached the Top 10 on the Hot Country Songs chart in 2005. The song served as the lead-off to his 2005 album That's Life. Also included on the album were a cover of Charley Pride's \\"You're My Jamaica\\", a song preceded by a spoken-word intro from United States Army general Tommy Franks, and a studio version of \\"Hillbilly Rap\\", which he had performed in concert since the early 1990s. McCoy's next single release, \\"The Last of a Dying Breed\\", peaked at 36. Darryl Worley and the Drew Davis Band were signed to 903 as well. Worley released his 2006 album Here and Now on 903, which produced the top 40 hits \\"Nothin' but a Love Thang\\" and \\"I Just Came Back from a War\\". In May 2007, McCoy announced that the label had filed for bankruptcy and closed its doors. In Summer of 2007, Neal could be seen showing off his comedic chops on local TV commercials in the Waco, Texas market for Mike Craig Chevrolet Pontiac Buick in Marlin, Texas. The commercials continued for approximately one year. In one of them Neal acts like a puppet in the hands of the branch manager of the Mike Craig dealership in Hillsboro, Texas. =2008‚Äì13: The Very Best of Neal McCoy, XII, and Pride= In 2008, Rhino Records issued a compilation album entitled The Very Best of Neal McCoy. This album reprised most of his biggest chart hits to that point, and it included the new recording \\"Rednecktified\\", which was released as a single but did not chart. Later that same year, he issued another single, \\"For the Troops\\", which also failed to chart. McCoy released a book titled New Mountain to Climb in 2011, which coincided with the release of a single of the same name. In April 2011, McCoy signed with Blaster Music. He released his twelfth album, XII, for the label on March 6, 2012. Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert co-produced the album with Brent Rowan, and sang backing vocals on its lead-off single \\"A-OK\\". A year later, McCoy released Pride: A Tribute to Charley Pride via Slate Creek Records, under the production of Garth Fundis. The album features guest appearances from Darius Rucker, Trace Adkins, and Raul Malo of The Mavericks. To promote the album, McCoy and Pride filmed a video for \\"Kaw-Liga\\", which was co-written and originally recorded by Hank Williams before Pride covered it in 1969. Personal life McCoy has been married to Melinda since 1980. The two met when McCoy was working at a shoe store in a local mall. The couple have two children: a son named Swayde, and a daughter Miki Dougherty. McCoy is also the head of a charity called the East Texas Angel Network, which helps provide money for families of seriously ill children.

It is one of the 22 dams of the Southeastern Anatolia Project and its purpose is hydroelectric power production, flood control and water storage. When operational, the dam will support a 1,200 MW power station and will form a 10.4 billion m3 reservoir. Construction of the dam began in 2006 and was originally expected to be completed by 2016. As part of the project, the much smaller Cizre Dam is to be constructed downstream for irrigation and power. The dam has drawn international controversy,http://iraqmarshrestoration.blogspot.co.uk/2010/08/ilusu-dam.html because it will flood portions of ancient Hasankeyf and necessitate the relocation of people living in the region. Because of this, the dam lost international funding in 2008.http://iraqmarshrestoration.blogspot.co.uk/p/press-release-doga-dernegi- support-for.html Kurdistan Workers' Party terrorists have also attacked infrastructure associated with the dam which led to construction delays. The dam began to fill its reservoir in late July 2019. Due to rainfall, the dam has achieved water levels up to 100m above the river bed and stored 5 billion cubic meters of water. The water level has reached to the elevation of 498.2m on 1 April 2020. DSI has started testing 2 turbines for energy production after completing the spillway testing. Dam has attained a storage of 7.6 billion cubic meters water volume. Water storage crest level was 513m on 19 April 2020. It would need 12m rise to achieve the maximum storage level. The first of six generators was commissioned on 19 May 2020, while its power plant is scheduled to reach full capacity by the end of 2020. Now three hydro- turbines have been commissioned since 19 June 2020 and remaining three are being tested. So far dam contributed 51M$ energy towards economy. Design The Ilƒ±su Dam will be a high and wide rock-fill embankment dam with a structural volume of . It will be wide at its crest and wide at its base. The dam will have an overflow spillway on its right bank which will be controlled by eight radial gates which will pour into four chutes before the water reaches a plunge pool. Its power station will be above ground and will contain 6 x 200 MW Francis turbine-generators with an expected annual generation of 3,833 GWh and gross hydraulic head of . The dam's reservoir will have a capacity of , of which will be active (or live, useful) storage and will be inactive (dead) storage. At a normal elevation of above sea level, the reservoir surface area will cover . Background Beginning in 1954 the Turkish government surveyed of the Tigris river downstream of Diyarbakƒ±r with the aim of identifying suitable locations for a hydroelectric power plant at an elevation below . Turkey's Electric Power Resources Survey and Development Administration (EIE) included 10 potential sites in its 1971 Tigris River Pre- Investigation Report. By 1975, the EIE had completed a technical and economic evaluation of the sites. Ilƒ±su was selected as the preferred site for geological reasons. A feasibility study and final design by international consultants (1980‚Äì82) resulted in a recommendation to construct both the Ilƒ±su Dam and the Cizre Dam downstream. There was little movement on the project for more than 15 years until the dam was added to the State Hydraulic Works' formal construction program in 1997 or 1998. On 5 August 2006, the foundation stone for the dam was laid and initial construction began. =Funding issues= To avoid inflation and other economic repercussions, the Turkish Government has often sought outside assistance to fund the Ilƒ±su Dam Project. However, pressure from environmental and human rights groups have often halted this process. In 2000, the British Government declined $236 million in funding for the Ilƒ±su Dam. Before the 2006 ground-breaking ceremony, German, Swiss and Austrian export credit agencies had agreed to fund $610 million of the project. In December 2008, the European firms suspended funds for the dam and gave Turkey a 180-day period to comply with over 150 international standards. In June 2009, after failing to meet the standards, the European firms officially cut the funding for the Ilƒ±su Dam Project. Shortly after the announcement of the funding loss, Turkey's Environment Minister Veysel Eroƒülu said ‚ÄúLet me tell you this, these power plants will be built. No one can stop it. This is the decision of the state and the government.‚Äù Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan is also committed to the Ilƒ±su Dam Project as well and claims Turkey will use internal or other international funding. Turkey stated that construction would start again in July 2009. In February 2010, it was announced that loans had been granted and the project would continue. On 15 July 2010, Andritz Hydro lifted a temporary suspension on supplying parts to the project and announced it would provide the six 200 MW Francis turbines for the power plant. Construction As part of early and ongoing construction, of roads are subject to raising and repairing work. A long temporary bridge was constructed upstream of the dam site which is supported by 30 sections of steel pipe. Additionally, a permanent steel-girder bridge with concrete supports was constructed just downstream of the dam. Construction of new Ilƒ±su and Ko√ßtepe villages were underway as well as the relocation of major portions of Hasankeyf. Excavations for the main body of the dam began in May 2011 and the first loads of fill were laid in January 2012. Diversion of the Tigris River began during a ceremony on 29 August 2012. As of April 2014, the project is 60% complete while the resettlement of Hasankeyf is 73% complete. All works are expected to be completed in 2015. In 2014, the dam, as well as others in southeast Turkey such as the Silvan Dam, became a prime target of Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) militants after peace talks collapsed with the government. Attacks on the dam, supporting structures and workers are part of the PKK's efforts to stop construction. Construction of the dam was suspended temporarily late in the year. On 3 February 2015, a convoy of supplies for the dam was attacked, injuring three. Several days later a worker was killed in his home by suspected PKK militants. The construction reached 96% in June 2017. In February 2018, construction on the dam was completed. On 1 June 2018, the reservoir was to begin impoundment but was delayed until November then 2019 following another detail due to water shortages in Iraq. Impoundment began in late July 2019. As of November 2019, the hydroelectric power generation would start in February 2020. Due to rainfalls dam has achieved the water elevation level of 498.2m as of 1 April 2020. Ilisu Dam has attained water level of 513m on 19 April 2020, and it is less than 12m from the maximum conservation level of 525m, according to CNN T√ºrk citing the State Hydraulic Works (DSI) by an AA correspondent.  Controversy  The Tigris flowing past the town of Hasankeyf, much of which will be flooded by the filling of the dam Completion of the Ilƒ±su Dam will cause the flooding of the majority of the ancient city of Hasankeyf, whose history stretches back over 10,000 years. About 199 settlements (villages and hamlets) will be fully or partially affected by flooding as well. This figure excludes vacant settlements, which will also be inundated. Three decades of conflict between the Turkish government and the PKK has resulted in the depopulation of many hamlets in the area, and so now their original inhabitants will never be able to return home either, in addition to the others who still live in the region. In 2006, the Turkish government estimated that 61,620 people would be \\"physically or economically displaced\\". Using 1990 census data, it had previously estimated that 55,127 people would be affected; updating these calculations using 2000 survey data produced a figure of 71,186. The official Turkish government line was expressed by then-Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan at the ground-breaking ceremony in 2006: \\"The step that we are taking today demonstrates that the south-east is no longer neglected. This dam will bring big gains to the local people.\\" The government says the project will generate 10,000 jobs, spur agricultural production through irrigation and boost tourism, although others argue that the tourism industry will be ruined due to the loss of Hasankeyf and that the local people will be forced to move to cities because the amount of money they were given to buy new homes in the region is insufficient. It has additionally been theorized that the main motive of this project is to Turkify the Kurds of the region, as forcing them to move to cities for jobs will pressure them to assimilate.https://corporatewatch.org/news/2015/sep/18/save-hasankeyf-stop- il%C4%B1su-dam Impact on downstream countries After the completion of the dam's construction in early spring 2018, the Iraqi government approached the Turkish authorities to postpone filling of the proposed Ilƒ±su reservoir until the end of June in the same year, due to the fact that the Tigris river has its highest levels during spring time. However, water shortages were witnessed in the Mosul dam, where water in the reservoir had more than 3 billion cubic meters compared with its levels of more than 8 billion cubic meters in the same period of the previous year. Moreover, the southern governorates of Iraq had the lowest portions of the river in years, in which the total Tigris water share in Iraq fell from 21 billion cubic metres to only 9.7 billion cubic metres instead. Such impacts which might lead to the drainage of the Mesopotamian Marshes and destruction of its ecology system, were part of the reasons to the emergence of a new wave of Iraqi protests, along with several other issues, especially in Basra Governorate. In addition, water shortages, lack of rainfall and depleted soils led nearly to a halt in farming rice, corn, sesame, sunflower seeds and cotton; and a decrease in the area planted for wheat and barley by half for the 2018‚Äì19 season.

He also was sued by a small Oklahoma company and was ordered to pay $10 million in damages.Spam King Robert Soloway smacked down, September 23, 2005 However, an injunction to cease his activities did not stop him from spamming: Soloway's company was responsible, from around June 2004 until April 2005, for a spam campaign (sent from open proxies) on behalf of various websites including broadcastingtoday.biz and broadcastadvertise.org (all since suspended), which promised to send recipients' Web site addresses to several million \\"opt-in email addresses.\\" He later claimed that as the service was free, the campaign was not illegal under the anti-spam law CAN-SPAM. A disclaimer in the spams stated, \\"the above emailing is only free if you are a nonprofit organization that aids child abuse victims.\\" Soloway insisted that NIM removed all MSN and Hotmail addresses from his mailing lists. He asserted that it was his company's subcontractors, or \\"spam affiliates\\", who had carried out the illegal activity (though he remained liable under both state and federal laws, including Washington's Commercial Electronic Mail Act and CAN-SPAM). He insisted he had fired all his subcontractors (none of whom he named) and had himself taken charge of emailing, using spam program Dark Mailer. However, a Washington superior court judge ruled that Soloway was in default. Soloway pleaded guilty to three counts on 14 March 2008. He formerly operated a company based in Seattle, Washington which he is calling \\"Broadcast E-mail Service\\" that offers \\"mailing services\\" by contract as well as a software program which the site promises will allow the buyer to \\"email your Web site to 2,500,000 opt-in email addresses for free.\\" E-mails advertising Soloway's company have been sent with forged headers (the headers purport to be \\"from\\" the person they were sent \\"to\\"). Soloway reportedly switched IP addresses for his Web sites to avoid detection. In 2006 he registered them through Chinese internet service providers (ISP) in an apparent ploy to mask his involvement.  Legal troubles  2005 judgments = In 2005, Microsoft won a $7.8 million civil judgment against Soloway, for spam sent through MSN and Hotmail services. That money, however, was never collected because Soloway's bank accounts remained elusive.Shukovsky, Paul and Vanessa Ho. \\"'Spam King' suspect seized.\\" Seattle Post-Intelligencer May 31, 2007 Later in 2005, Robert Braver, an internet services provider based in Oklahoma, was awarded $10,075,000.00 in another spam-related case against Soloway. In this lawsuit, a permanent injunction was issued against Soloway, enjoining him from further spam activities.United States District Court #CIV-05-210-T. \\"ROBERT H. BRAVER, Plaintiff, v. NEWPORT INTERNET MARKETING CORPORATION, and ROBERT ALAN SOLOWAY, Defendants\\" Those judgments, however, did not stop Soloway's illegal spamming; in fact, he mocked them.E-Mail from Robert Soloway to spamhaus.org, May 17, 2005 = Arrested in May 2007 = He was arrested on May 30, 2007, after a federal grand jury indicted him on 35 charges including mail fraud, wire fraud, e-mail fraud, identity theft and money laundering. If convicted as charged, he could have faced decades in prison. Prosecutors wanted to seize $773,000 that Soloway made from his firm. = Pleaded guilty in March 2008 = On March 14, 2008, Robert Soloway reached an agreement with federal prosecutors, two weeks before his scheduled trial on 40 charges. Soloway pleaded guilty to three charges‚Äîfelony mail fraud, fraud in connection with e-mail, and failing to file a 2005 tax return. In exchange, federal prosecutors dropped all other charges. Soloway faced up to 27 years in prison on the most serious charge, and up to $625,000 total in fines. = Prison sentence = On 22 July 2008 Robert Soloway was sentenced to 47 months in federal prison, and ordered to repay over $700,000.

The album was released in 1997 by Stephen Bray, who was the producer of the songs when they were recorded, and was distributed by Soultone. It was released as In the Beginning in European countries. Madonna met up with Bray, her former boyfriend, in 1980 when she was trying to establish her music career. She had left the band Breakfast Club and enlisted Bray's help to further her career. Together they started writing songs and recorded them at New York's Music Building studio. The songs recorded at that time‚Äîseven of which were written solely by Madonna‚Äîwere released in Pre-Madonna. Although not authorized by Madonna, Bray decided to release Pre-Madonna by remixing some of the tracks, and keeping the others in their original form. Included were the demo versions of \\"Everybody\\" and \\"Burning Up\\" which Madonna used for her self-titled debut album. The album received mixed reviews, with some critics deeming the release as unnecessary, while others were delighted to hear Madonna's original recordings. Background In 1979, Madonna was trying to establish her career in the music industry. She was the drummer of a band called Breakfast Club, which was headed by the Gilroy brothers, Dan and Ed. After their lead female vocalist left, Madonna was given the role of the lead female singer. However, she wanted to be the only female voice of the band, and opposed against the introduction of another female vocalist, Angie Smith. This led to a dispute between Dan and her, which resulted in Madonna leaving the band. She then formed a new band called Madonna and The Sky, but that also faced a major problem within a few weeks when its principal drummer Mike Shenoy, who had a full-time job and a fianc√©, decided to leave the band. Undaunted by Shenoy's departure, Madonna partnered up with her Michigan boyfriend Stephen Bray. Bray and Madonna had met at the University of Michigan in 1976, where he was working as a waiter in a club at Ann Arbor. Bray used to take Madonna on the tours of his band; after their romance ended, they remained good friends. When Madonna telephoned Bray to come and join the band, he immediately accepted and joined as the drummer replacing Shenoy. Madonna's main focus now was to become a professional singer, and she asked Bray to help her achieve that. Together they started writing songs and recorded them under Gotham Records, in New York's rehearsal studio called the Music Building. The songs recorded included \\"Ain't No Big Deal\\", \\"Laugh to Keep from Crying\\", \\"Crimes of Passion\\" and \\"Stay\\". Bray was the producer of these recordings, along with some demos that Madonna had recorded, including \\"Everybody\\" and \\"Burning Up\\". The latter two songs were accepted for Madonna's self-titled debut album, in a reworked version; however the demos were left with Bray. Composition When Bray decided to release the demo tracks in an album, he remixed some of them for a more contemporary appeal. \\"Ain't No Big Deal\\" was re-recorded and released as the B-side to her singles \\"True Blue\\" and \\"Papa Don't Preach\\". The track features Madonna's typical high-pitched vocal timbre of that time, and talks about a carefree woman proclaiming her love. \\"Stay\\" and \\"Don't You Know\\" were combined into one song, \\"Stay\\", which was included on the Like a Virgin album. The songs use triple-rhythms and double-tracked vocals and includes a noise resembling someone slapping a microphone and a spoken sequence which fades away in the end. The 1981 versions of \\"Everybody\\", \\"Burning Up\\" and \\"Ain't No Big Deal\\" are the pure demo versions of officially released songs whose titles are tagged with the year in which they were recorded to differentiate them from the officially released versions. According to Rikky Rooksby, author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, \\"Everybody\\" demo version is more or less same as the single version, without the synth grooves added in it. Similarly, the demo \\"Burning Up\\" does not contain the guitar riffs of the single version. Larry Flick from Billboard described \\"Crimes of Passion\\" as \\"disco-spiced\\". The song talks about how infidelity can actually set one free from a doomed relationship. Madonna's voice sounds fuller in the verses and chorus, but takes a higher pitch in the bridge. \\"Laugh to Keep from Crying\\" is a rock song, with 12-string Rickenbacker guitar played by Madonna herself. Madonna's voice sounds drunk and the drum machine backs her voice in the chorus. AllMusic compared her sound on the song to that of The Pretenders. According to Bray, \\"[Pre-Madonna] carve the dance sound of a generation and chronicle Madonna's first musical self-definition phase.\\" Release and reception At the time the compilation was released, Madonna was riding a wave of publicity as a result of the film Evita and her pregnancy with daughter Lourdes. Bray said in an interview with Extra that Madonna would receive royalties for the release, and added \\"There's nothing in these tapes that would be embarrassing, and just hoping that she would like it as much as we do.\\" In the European countries, the album was re-titled as In the Beginning, featuring different artwork, and a re-arranged track list. Pre- Madonna received mixed reviews from critics. Mark Egan from Rocky Mountain News writes that \\"although the songs have soul in them, it's the delivery that lacks in Madonna's voice; you just feel that something is really missing.\\" Mark Zug from Chicago Tribune commented that \\"the demos on Pre-Madonna are a delight to listen to. To all the Madonna fans, this is one album worth collecting and replaying.\\" Jasmine Temple from Lexington Herald-Leader calls the album, \\"a gloriously voyeuristic‚Äîand unauthorized‚Äîglimpse at Madonna's past, the woman she was then. You can actually sense the development of the icon she is today from the songs.\\" Robin DeRosa from USA Today was disappointed with the release, saying that \\"it feels forced. This release is as unneeded as the hoopla surrounding Madonna's new born. Every artist has demo recordings in their early phases of career and they are generally not good. This one is not different.\\" After Madonna was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008, Tony Sclafani from MSNBC noted that none of Madonna's songs were in the rock music genre, \\"but all use rock as a jumping off point. Audible evidence of Madonna's rock roots can be found on the collection of early demos Pre-Madonna.\\" Track listing All tracks written by Madonna except \\"Ain't No Big Deal\\" by Stephen Bray.

The title originates from lyrics Fenriz of Darkthrone wrote for the band; the lyrics sheet can be found in the 2009 limited edition EP, Life Eternal. Despite being a bootleg, the album is sometimes listed as one of the band's main albums, mainly due to the notoriety regarding the cover art, which is an image of the late Mayhem vocalist Per \\"Dead\\" Ohlin's suicide. The image of his death was photographed by guitarist Euronymous via a disposable camera. Cover The album is infamous and controversial for bearing a photograph of vocalist Dead (Per Yngve Ohlin), shortly after his suicide in April 1991. The photograph was taken by guitarist Euronymous (√òystein Aarseth), shortly after he entered the cabin the band shared and discovered the body. Michael Moynihan, Didrik S√∏derlind: Lords of Chaos: The Bloody Rise of the Satanic Metal Underground. First Edition. Venice, CA: Feral House 1998, pp. 59f. Euronymous took bits of Dead's skull and made them into necklaces for members of the black metal scene, including the band's drummer Hellhammer. Necrobutcher, the band's bassist, was so disgusted with Euronymous' actions that he left Mayhem. He was replaced by Burzum's Varg Vikernes, who murdered Euronymous two years later.

This original version contains eight songs from a concert in Sarpsborg on 28 February 1990. The label bears the band's logo and the album title in golden ink. The album has been reissued many times by various bootleg record labels, with many versions including four extra songs, recorded at the band's first-ever concert in Ski, Norway on 20 April 1985, with Messiah on vocals. Most of the re- releases erroneously claim that the additional songs come from a 1986 Lillehammer show with Maniac on vocals, but the band did not play live at all during that year, or indeed, for the rest of that decade. They would not play in Lillehammer until many years later (after Grand Declaration of War was released).

The station was located at the Allerton Junction of the routes from Liverpool to Manchester and Crewe.

It served as the vehicle for the promulgation of his Buddhist teachings, and was also the name by which his community was known from 1973 until 1990. Starting in 1976 it was paralleled by a governmental structure for establishing the non-denominational enlightened society of Shambhala Kingdom, which included Shambhala Training among many other activities. Eventually, the Vajradhatu organization was renamed Shambhala International by Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche. History The community of Ch√∂gyam Trungpa originated in 1970 with his arrival in North America from Scotland. The first established center of his teachings was \\"Tail of the Tiger\\" in Barnet, Vermont (now Karm√™ Ch√∂ling). When he began teaching at University of Colorado Boulder in 1971, a second branch of the community began to form there. When Vajradhatu was incorporated in Colorado in 1973, it consolidated Tail of the Tiger, Rocky Mountain Dharma Center, a retreat facility in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado; and Karma Dzong, an urban meditation center in Boulder. The organization grew to include Gampo Abbey in Nova Scotia and dozens of smaller meditation centers called Dharmadhatus in cities around the US, Canada and later in Europe. In the early 1970s the community grew rapidly and attracted the involvement of such notables as Allen Ginsberg, Anne Waldman, and many others. As the decade wore on, the hippies and sixties counterculture members who comprised the large part of the membership were asked by Trungpa to experiment with more formal modes of behavior, attire, address, and societal expressions in general. Vajradhatu hosted visits by Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, 16th Karmapa, head of the Kagyu, in 1974, Khyentse Norbu, head of the Nyingma, in 1976, and the 14th Dalai Lama in 1981. In 1976 Trungpa Rinpoche began his cycle of Shambhala teachings and, with his students, manifesting forms of Shambhala society. In 1986 he moved the international headquarters of Vajradhatu to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he died the following year. A large number of his disciples emigrated from the United States to Nova Scotia along with him. In 1972 Trungpa had identified Thomas F. Rich, an American with Buddhist name √ñsel Tendzin, as his dharma heir, and in a formal ceremony on August 22, 1976, Trungpa appointed Rich as Dorje Gyaltsap, Vajra Regent and Director of the First Class of Vajradhatu. As described in the 1977 article in \\"Garuda V\\", which also reproduces the proclamation (signed by Trungpa XI and the 16th Karmapa, Trungpa empowered Thomas Rich \\"as his regent and as a holder of the Kagyu and Nyingma lineages\\". Trungpa further stated \\"There is the possibility that members of the sangha, Western people, can take over from the Tibetans\\". Following Trungpa's death, senior Kagyu lineage holder Tai Situpa recommended that he himself take over leadership of Vajradhatu in conjunction with Trungpa's half brother, Damchu Tenphel, who resided in Tibet.Eldershaw 2004, pg 229 Tendzin declined the offer, and assumed leadership of the organization until his own death shortly thereafter in 1990 of HIV/AIDS, amid controversy over admissions that he had unprotected sex with students while knowing he was HIV+. √ñsel Tendzin infected at least one male student with HIV; the young man later died of AIDS.Butterfield 1994Dart 1989 Transition to Shambhala International After the death of √ñsel Tendzin, √ñsel Rangdr√∂l Mukpo (Trungpa's eldest son, then known as \\"the Sawang,\\" now Sakyong Mipham) became the new spiritual head. The community had been deeply divided and in distress over the events surrounding √ñsel Tendzin's death, and repeatedly turned to the elder statesmen of the Kagyu and Nyingma lineages for guidance.The Chronicles of Ch√∂gyam Trungpa Rinpoche The succession of √ñsel Rangdr√∂l was approved by the heads of both the Kagyu and Nyingma lineages, who encouraged the community to persevere. Jamg√∂n Kongtr√ºl the third, one of the four regents of the Karma Kagyu lineage in the period when the Karmapa had yet to be recognized, issued a statement that \\"His Holiness [Dilgo Khenstse Rinpoche, head of the Nyingma lineage and the Sawang's teacher] and the Kagyu lineage holders are all in agreement that the Sawang √ñsel Rangdr√∂l Mukpo should become the lineage holder of Vajradhatu.\\".The Chronicles of Ch√∂gyam Trungpa Rinpoche In February 2000, restated articles of incorporation were signed, officially changing the name from Vajradhatu to Shambhala International. The change of name, which began informally with the Sakyong Mipham's assumption of leadership in 1990, reflected his approach of integrating the Shambhala teachings within Buddhism and making them the unifying principle of a Shambhala Buddhist sangha.http://www.shambhala.org/int/SMR_ltr_05.pdf This transition enabled the organization to avoid lawsuits and consequent financial ruin.Eldershaw 2007, pg. 80 NotesReferences * Butterfield, Stephen T.

The area was suburban to London, and formed part of the Metropolitan Police District and from 1933 was included in the area of the London Passenger Transport Board. HistoryLocal board and urban district= Bromley Local Government District was formed in 1867 when the parish of Bromley adopted the Local Government Act 1858, and a local board of twelve members was formed to govern the town. The Local Government Act 1894 reconstituted the area as Bromley Urban District. An urban district council of 16 members replaced the local board. =Incorporation= The town was granted a charter of incorporation to become a municipal borough in 1903. The granting of the charter was celebrated by a public holiday in the town on 2 September 1903. The charter was brought by train to Bromley South station where it was handed to the charter mayor. The mayor then rode in procession led by units of the Royal Horse Artillery and the Royal West Kent Regiment, accompanied by mayors and mace bearers of boroughs in Kent and the County of London and watched by an estimated crowd of 20,000. A sports day and carnival was held at Queen's Mead. Under the charter a town council consisting of a mayor, six aldermen and eighteen councillors replaced the UDC. The council was initially based at the old Town Hall in the Market Square but moved to a new Town Hall in Tweedy Road in 1907. =Boundary changes= The area of the borough was increased in 1934, when a county review order added parts of the abolished Bromley Rural District (Hayes and part of Keston). The council was subsequently enlarged to seven aldermen and twenty-one councillors. In 1965 the municipal borough was abolished by the London Government Act 1963 and its former area transferred to Greater London from Kent. Its former area was combined with that of other districts to form the present-day London Borough of Bromley. Borough council The borough council was initially controlled by independents, with a handful of Labour party councillors forming an opposition group. There was a single Communist councillor from 1945 to 1947.Municipal Elections, The Times, November 2, 1947, p.8 The Conservative Party began to contest elections in 1947, and gained a majority in 1950.The Municipal Elections, The Times, May 12, 1950, p.4 At the final election prior to abolition the Conservatives lost their overall majority with 14 councillors and aldermen against 6 independents, 4 Labour and 4 Liberal members.Election Results in the Boroughs, The Times, May 10, 1963 Coat of arms Armorial bearings were granted to the borough by the College of Arms on 19 April 1904. The blazon was as follows:A C Fox-Davies, The Book of Public Arms, 2nd edition, London, 1915 Quarterly gules and azure, on a fesse wavy argent three ravens volant paroper, between in the first quarter two branches of broom slipped of the third, in the second a sun in splendour, in the third an escallop shell or, and in the fourth a horse forcene argent. Crest: On a wreath of the colours, upon two bars wavy azure and argent, an escalllop shell as in the arms, between two branches of broom proper. The sprigs of broom were in allusion to the name \\"Bromley\\". The silver wave bearing three ravens represented the River Ravensbourne, while the sun was for Sundridge. The scallop shell was derived from the arms of the diocese of Rochester, granted the manor of Bromley at the time of King Ethelbert.

Stand-up comedy Having initially travelled to the UK at the age of 27 as a summer student at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art,Reginald D Hunter: ‚ÄòThe British really reward cleverness‚Äô Hunter became a comedian after performing his first comedy set as a dare, for which he received ¬£100. Realising that he enjoyed performing comedy, and that it might be profitable, he turned his attention from acting to stand-up. In 2006 and 2008, he participated in Project X Presents events. In 2013 he toured Ireland with his show In the Midst of Crackers.\\"Reg D Hunter promises crackin‚Äô show\\", Cork Independent, 4 April 2013. Hunter often uses variations of the term \\"nigga\\" in the titles of his shows; Reginald D Hunter: Pride & Prejudice... & Niggas attracted some controversy, and the poster was banned from the London Underground. His tour with Steve Hughes, called Trophy Nigga, played 55 venues around the UK, but not all the venues used the tour title. Hunter joked that this was because promoters didn't like the word \\"trophy\\". In April 2013, Hunter performed at an engagement for the Professional Footballers' Association. Following the event, PFA chairman Clarke Carlisle accused Hunter of racism, as he had used the word \\"nigger\\" during his set. Carlisle also said that some of those present had found Hunter's material \\"highly offensive\\". In response, Hunter posted to his Facebook page many photos of himself taken after his set with people attending the event, with most smiling.

In geometry, the folium of Descartes is an algebraic curve defined by the equation :x^3 + y^3 - 3 a x y = 0 \\\\,. It forms a loop in the first quadrant with a double point at the origin and asymptote :x + y + a = 0 \\\\,. It is symmetrical about y = x. The name comes from the Latin word folium which means \\"leaf\\". The curve was featured, along with a portrait of Descartes, on an Albanian stamp in 1966.  History  The curve was first proposed by Descartes in 1638. Its claim to fame lies in an incident in the development of calculus. Descartes challenged Fermat to find the tangent line to the curve at an arbitrary point since Fermat had recently discovered a method for finding tangent lines. Fermat solved the problem easily, something Descartes was unable to do.Simmons, p. 101 Since the invention of calculus, the slope of the tangent line can be found easily using implicit differentiation.  Graphing the curve  Since the equation is degree 3 in both x and y, and does not factor, it is difficult to solve for one of the variables. However, the equation in polar coordinates is: :r = \\\\frac{3 a \\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\cos \\\\theta}{\\\\sin^3 \\\\theta + \\\\cos^3 \\\\theta }. which can be plotted easily. By using this formula, the area of the interior of the loop is found to be 3a^2/2. Another technique is to write y = px and solve for x and y in terms of p. This yields the rational parametric equations: x = {{3ap} \\\\over {1 + p^3}},\\\\, y = {{3ap^2} \\\\over {1 + p^3}}. We can see that the parameter is related to the position on the curve as follows: * p < -1 corresponds to x>0, y<0: the right, lower, \\"wing\\". * -1 < p < 0 corresponds to x<0, y>0: the left, upper \\"wing\\". * p > 0 corresponds to x>0, y>0: the loop of the curve. Another way of plotting the function can be derived from symmetry over y = x. The symmetry can be seen directly from its equation (x and y can be interchanged). By applying rotation of 45¬∞ CW for example, one can plot the function symmetric over rotated x axis. This operation is equivalent to a substitution: : x = {{u+v} \\\\over {\\\\sqrt{2}}},\\\\, y = {{u-v} \\\\over {\\\\sqrt{2}}} and yields : v = \\\\pm u\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{3a \\\\sqrt{2} - 2u}{6u + 3a \\\\sqrt{2}}} Plotting in the cartesian system of (u,v) gives the folium rotated by 45¬∞ and therefore symmetric by u axis. Since the folium is symmetrical about y = x, it passes through the point (3a/2,3a/2).  Relationship to the trisectrix of MacLaurin  The folium of Descartes is related to the trisectrix of Maclaurin by affine transformation. To see this, start with the equation :x^3 + y^3 = 3 a x y \\\\,, and change variables to find the equation in a coordinate system rotated 45 degrees. This amounts to setting x = {{X+Y} \\\\over \\\\sqrt{2}}, y = {{X-Y} \\\\over \\\\sqrt{2}}. In the X,Y plane the equation is :2X(X^2 + 3Y^2) = 3 \\\\sqrt{2}a(X^2-Y^2). If we stretch the curve in the Y direction by a factor of \\\\sqrt{3} this becomes :2X(X^2 + Y^2) = a \\\\sqrt{2}(3X^2-Y^2) which is the equation of the trisectrix of Maclaurin.

It is named after the German mathematician Otto Hesse. This curve was suggested for application in elliptic curve cryptography, because arithmetic in this curve representation is faster and needs less memory than arithmetic in standard Weierstrass form.Cauchy-Desbove's Formulae: Hessian- elliptic Curves and Side-Channel Attacks, Marc Joye and Jean-Jacques Quisquarter  Definition  A Hessian curve of equation x^3+y^3+1=0.3xy Let K be a field and consider an elliptic curve E in the following special case of Weierstrass form over K : : Y^2+a_1 XY+a_3 Y=X^3 where the curve has discriminant \\\\Delta = (a_3^3(a_1^3 - 27a_3)) = a_3^3 \\\\delta. Then the point P=(0,0) has order 3. To prove that P=(0,0) has order 3, note that the tangent to E at P is the line Y=0 which intersects E with multiplicity 3 at P. Conversely, given a point P of order 3 on an elliptic curve E both defined over a field K one can put the curve into Weierstrass form with P=(0,0) so that the tangent at P is the line Y=0. Then the equation of the curve is Y^2+a_1 XY+a_3 Y=X^3 with a_1,a_3\\\\in K. Now, to obtain the Hessian curve, it is necessary to do the following transformation: First let \\\\mu denote a root of the polynomial : T^3-\\\\delta T^2+{\\\\delta^2\\\\over3}T+ a_3\\\\delta^2=0. Then : \\\\mu={\\\\delta-a_1\\\\delta^{2/3}\\\\over 3}. Note that if K has a finite field of order q\\\\equiv 2 (mod 3), then every element of K has a unique cube root; in general, \\\\mu lies in an extension field of K. Now by defining the following value D=\\\\frac{3(\\\\mu-\\\\delta)}{\\\\mu} another curve, C, is obtained, that is birationally equivalent to E: : C : x^3 + y^3 + z^3= Dxyz which is called cubic Hessian form (in projective coordinates) : C : x^3 + y^3 + 1= Dxy in the affine plane ( satisfying x=\\\\frac{X}{Z} and y=\\\\frac{Y}{Z} ). Furthermore, D^3 e1 (otherwise, the curve would be singular). Starting from the Hessian curve, a birationally equivalent Weierstrass equation is given by : v^2 = u^3 - 27D(D^3 + 8)u + 54(D^6 - 20 D^3 - 8), \\\\, under the transformations: : (x,y) = (\\\\eta (u + 9D^2), - 1 + \\\\eta(3D^3 - Dx -12)) \\\\, and : (u,v) = (-9D^2 + \\\\varepsilon x, 3\\\\varepsilon(y - 1)) \\\\, where: :\\\\eta = \\\\frac{6(D^3 - 1)(v + 9D^3 - 3Du - 36)}{(u + 9D^2)^3 + (3Dd - Du - 12)^3} and :\\\\varepsilon = \\\\frac{12(D^3 - 1)}{Dx + y + 1}  Group law  It is interesting to analyze the group law of the elliptic curve, defining the addition and doubling formulas (because the SPA and DPA attacks are based on the running time of these operations). Furthermore, in this case, we only need to use the same procedure to compute the addition, doubling or subtraction of points to get efficient results, as said above. In general, the group law is defined in the following way: if three points lie in the same line then they sum up to zero. So, by this property, the group laws are different for every curve. In this case, the correct way is to use the Cauchy-Desboves¬¥ formulas, obtaining the point at infinity \\\\theta = ( 1 : -1: 0), that is, the neutral element (the inverse of \\\\theta is \\\\theta again). Let P=(x1,y1) be a point on the curve. The line y=-x+(x_1+y_1) contains the point P and the point at infinity \\\\theta. Therefore, -P is the third point of the intersection of this line with the curve. Intersecting the elliptic curve with the line, the following condition is obtained x_2-(x_1+y_1)\\\\cdot x + x_1\\\\cdot y_1=\\\\theta Since x_1+y_1+D is non zero (because D^3 is distinct to 1), the x-coordinate of -P is y_1 and the y-coordinate of -P is x_1 , i.e., -P=(y_1,x_1) or in projective coordinates -P=(Y_1:X_1:Z_1) . In some application of elliptic curve cryptography and the elliptic curve method of factorization (ECM) it is necessary to compute the scalar multiplications of P, say [n]P for some integer n, and they are based on the double-and-add method; these operations need the addition and doubling formulas. Doubling Now, if P=(X_1:Y_1:Z_1) is a point on the elliptic curve, it is possible to define a \\"doubling\\" operation using Cauchy-Desboves¬¥ formulae: [2]P=(Y_1\\\\cdot (X_1^3-Z_1^3) : X_1\\\\cdot (Z_1^3-Y_1^3) : Z_1\\\\cdot (Y_1^3-X_1^3)) Addition In the same way, for two different points, say P=(X_1 : Y_1 : Z_1) and Q=(X_2 : Y_2 : Z_2), it is possible to define the addition formula. Let R denote the sum of these points, R=P+Q, then its coordinates are given by: R=(Y_1^2\\\\cdot X_2\\\\cdot Z_2-Y_2^2\\\\cdot X_1\\\\cdot Z_1 : X_1^2\\\\cdot Y_2\\\\cdot Z_2-X_2^2\\\\cdot Y_1\\\\cdot Z_1 : Z_1^2\\\\cdot X_2\\\\cdot Y_2-Z_2^2\\\\cdot X_1\\\\cdot Y_1) Algorithms and examples There is one algorithm that can be used to add two different points or to double; it is given by Joye and Quisquater. Then, the following result gives the possibility the obtain the doubling operation by the addition: Proposition. Let P = (X,Y,Z) be a point on a Hessian elliptic curve E(K). Then: 2(X:Y:Z) = (Z:X:Y) + (Y:Z:X) (2). Furthermore, we have (Z:X:Y)‚â†(Y:Z:X). Finally, contrary to other parameterizations, there is no subtraction to compute the negation of a point. Hence, this addition algorithm can also be used for subtracting two points P= (X_1:Y_1:Z_1) and Q= (X_2:Y_2:Z_2) on a Hessian elliptic curve: ( X1:Y1:Z1) - ( X2:Y2:Z2) = ( X1:Y1:Z1) + (Y2:X2:Z2) (3) To sum up, by adapting the order of the inputs according to equation (2) or (3), the addition algorithm presented above can be used indifferently for: Adding 2 (diff.) points, Doubling a point and Subtracting 2 points with only 12 multiplications and 7 auxiliary variables including the 3 result variables. Before the invention of Edwards curves, these results represent the fastest known method for implementing the elliptic curve scalar multiplication towards resistance against side-channel attacks. For some algorithms protection against side-channel attacks is not necessary. So, for these doublings can be faster. Since there are many algorithms, only the best for the addition and doubling formulas is given here, with one example for each one: = Addition = Let P1 = (X1:Y1:Z1) and P2 = (X2:Y2:Z2) be two points distinct to \\\\theta. Assuming that Z1=Z2=1 then the algorithm is given by: A = X1 Y2 B = Y1 X2 :X3 = B Y1-Y2 A :Y3 = X1 A-B X2 :Z3 = Y2 X2-X1 Y1 The cost needed is 8 multiplications and 3 additions readdition cost of 7 multiplications and 3 additions, depending on the first point. ;Example Given the following points in the curve for d=-1 P1=(1:0:-1) and P2=(0:-1:1), then if P3=P1+P2 we have: :X3 = 0-1=-1 :Y3 = -1-0=-1 :Z3 = 0-0=0 Then: P3 = (-1:-1:0) = Doubling = Let P = (X1 : Y1 : Z1) be a point, then the doubling formula is given by: *A = X12 *B = Y12 *D = A + B *G = (X1 + Y1)2 ‚àí D *X3 = (2Y1 ‚àí G) √ó (X1 + A + 1) *Y3 = (G ‚àí 2X1) √ó (Y1 + B + 1) *Z3 = (X1 ‚àí Y1) √ó (G + 2D) The cost of this algorithm is three multiplications + three squarings + 11 additions + 3√ó2\\\\. ;Example If P=(-1:-1:1) is a point over the Hessian curve with parameter d=-1, then the coordinates of 2P=(X:Y:Z) are given by: X = (2.(-1)-2)(-1+1+1) = -4 Y = (-4-2.(-1))((-1)+1+1) = -2 Z = (-1-(-1))((-4)+2.2) = 0 That is, 2P=(-4:-2:0) Extended coordinates There is another coordinates system with which a Hessian curve can be represented; these new coordinates are called extended coordinates. They can speed up the addition and doubling.

The equation of the hippopede is 4x2+y2=(x2+y2)2. In geometry, a hippopede (from Ancient Greek ·º±œÄœÄŒøœÄŒ≠Œ¥Œ∑, \\"horse fetter\\") is a plane curve determined by an equation of the form :(x^2+y^2)^2=cx^2+dy^2, where it is assumed that and since the remaining cases either reduce to a single point or can be put into the given form with a rotation. Hippopedes are bicircular rational algebraic curves of degree 4 and symmetric with respect to both the x and y axes. Special cases When d > 0 the curve has an oval form and is often known as an oval of Booth, and when the curve resembles a sideways figure eight, or lemniscate, and is often known as a lemniscate of Booth, after 19th-century mathematician James Booth who studied them. Hippopedes were also investigated by Proclus (for whom they are sometimes called Hippopedes of Proclus) and Eudoxus. For , the hippopede corresponds to the lemniscate of Bernoulli. Definition as spiric sections Hippopedes with a = 1, b = 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0. Hippopedes with b = 1, a = 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0. Hippopedes can be defined as the curve formed by the intersection of a torus and a plane, where the plane is parallel to the axis of the torus and tangent to it on the interior circle. Thus it is a spiric section which in turn is a type of toric section. If a circle with radius a is rotated about an axis at distance b from its center, then the equation of the resulting hippopede in polar coordinates : r^2 = 4 b (a - b \\\\sin^{2} \\\\theta) or in Cartesian coordinates :(x^2+y^2)^2+4b(b-a)(x^2+y^2)=4b^2x^2.

The station was located on the Northern Line of the Merseyrail suburban rail network. The station was closed in 2006 when it was replaced by Liverpool South Parkway, which is a combined bus and rail interchange. The proximity of the stations was so close the platforms of South Parkway nearly merged onto the Garston station's platforms. History A 1913 Railway Clearing House map showing (left) railways in the vicinity of Garston The station was opened on 1 April 1874 by the Cheshire Lines Committee. It was served by local services between Liverpool Central, Warrington and Manchester, and also to Aintree Central on the North Liverpool Extension Line. In 1960 the passenger service to Aintree was cut back to Gateacre. In 1966 services from Manchester were diverted to Liverpool Lime Street, leaving Garston with just the Gateacre-Liverpool train. This service continued until 17 April 1972, when Garston station closed along with the line from Liverpool Central. In 1978 the former CLC route through Garston was partially reinstated as part of the electrified Northern Line of Merseyrail, and the station reopened on 2 January 1978 as a single platform terminus for services from Kirkby. Prior to the 1972 closure, the station had been named simply Garston, but upon reopening in 1978, it became Garston (Lancs), which was changed in 1979 to Garston (Merseyside). In 1983 services were extended further south to Hunts Cross and Garston once again became a through station with two platforms. In 1984 services were diverted to run to Southport instead of Kirkby. From the airports opening in 1933 until 1986 it was the nearest station to Liverpool Airport. In 2004 work began on a combined rail-bus interchange at Liverpool South Parkway. The new station's proximity to Garston rendered the old station surplus to requirements. Garston closed on 10 June 2006 and Liverpool South Parkway opened the following day. The station was demolished soon after closure and no trace remains as of 2013.\\"Disused Stations - Garston\\"Disused Station; Retrieved 10 May 2016 Services At the time of closure, trains operated to Southport via Liverpool Central to the north, and Hunts Cross to the south at 15-minute intervals, Monday-Saturday daytimes.

It is almost midway between Derby and Nottingham and is near junction 25 of the M1 motorway, and the A52. In 1870 it had a population of 203 when there was a grammar school that served seven neighbouring parishes.John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales, 1870 History All Saints' Church was built in Elizabethan times by members of the Willoughby family, who had acquired Risley in 1350 AD and who also founded a free school in the village.

Typically a character or characters are linked to one or more of the four classical elements (air, water, earth and fire) common to most ancient philosophies (particularly the Greek, Hindu, Buddhist and Japanese or Chinese traditions), either through special powers granted, ability to mimic the element, or other means. Sometimes a fifth element is included, such as aether (also known as Quintessence), void, or something else altogether. Light and/or shadow/darkness are also often portrayed as elements in addition to the classical four or in place of any of them. Reception The classical elements and their use in literary history have served as the subject of various published books. In How Artists See The Elements: Earth, Air, Fire, Water, Colleen Carroll examines \\"how the four elements have been depicted in works of art from different time periods and places.\\" In Legends of Earth, Ice, Fire and Water, Eric Hadley and Tessa Hadley provide a \\"collection of myths and legends from different parts of the world about the four basic elements without which life would not be possible.\\" According to Publishers Weekly, in Earth, Fire, Water, Air, Mary Hoffman and Jane Ray collect \\"snippets of factual information, myths, stories, poems and musings in this fascinating volume about the four classic elements.\\" The reception of the classical elements by scholars and mainstream critics varies considerably, largely depending on the medium and/or use of the classical elements. For example, the classical elements have served as significant plot elements in the various Mortal Kombat fictional universes. Blaze, a fire elemental, appears in multiple Mortal Kombat games, including as the end boss in the most recent game. The film Mortal Kombat: Annihilation features Elder gods based on the four elements. Notable examplesPok√©mon= Pok√©mon has 18 elements that go beyond fire, water, earth and air. Those elements are known as types. They have weaknesses and strengths (e.g. fire is weak against water but is strong against grass (not a classic element)). =AdventureQuest= In AdventureQuest, there are 8 elements, which are Fire, Wind, Earth, Ice, Water, Energy, Light, and Darkness, which are stated to be in a constant struggle and each ruled by a \\"elemental lord\\" with each element being able to do differing amounts of damage to a character or monster. A base guide to this would be that a being made from ice would be usually weak to fire. =Adventure Time= In the animated TV series Adventure Time, there are four main elements: ice, fire, candy, and slime. Firstly introduced in the Evergreen episode, then more explored in the season 7 episode Elemental and in the Elements miniseries. These four elements began to exist since the beginning of the evolution in the planet, presented in special individuals from the prehistoric age to the Land of Ooo times, where the characters; Patience St Pim; Flame Princess; Princess Bubblegum; and Slime Princess, are the actual incarnations of the ancient elementals. It was revealed in this miniseries that there was a secret fifth element - lumps - which Lumpy Space Princess is the incarnation of. =The Alchemy Index= The Alchemy Index is Thrice's fifth studio recording, a four- disc concept album that was split between two releases, the first in October 2007 and the second in April 2008. The band originally planned to release four discs at once, each disc with six tracks representing one of the four classical elements: Fire, Water, Earth, and Air. Recorded in guitarist Teppei Teranishi's house in Orange, \\"Alchemy\\" is full of experimentation. Inspired by Radiohead, Botch, Pelican and ISIS among others, Thrice has produced an effort that can be blisteringly heavy and melodically serene, as evidenced by the sludgy baritone guitar work of \\"Fire\\" and the sampled drums, synthesizers and piano on \\"Water.\\" Kensrue said \\"Earth,\\" recorded to sound as if the listener was in the room where it was being played, features acoustic guitars, upright bass, banjos, piano, tambourine and some horns. Air, the singer said, is the most dynamic and ties the other three records together. The final song on each disc is written in the form of a sonnet, depicting the relationship of man with each of the particular elements. Each of these songs is in iambic pentameter, with a concluding rhyming couplet. These final couplets also contain the same vocal melody and chord progression as each other, although they are in different keys. The Artwork for the Album was designed by Dustin Kensrue. =Angels & Demons= In Dan Brown's thriller novel Angels & Demons, the antagonist kidnaps four cardinals on the night of conclave and brands them with the ambigrammatic words \\"Earth,\\" \\"Air,\\" \\"Fire,\\" and \\"Water.\\" He then kills each cardinal using a method based on their respective elements; Cardinal Ebner, who was branded with the word \\"Earth,\\" suffocates by having dirt shoved down his throat. Cardinal Lamasse (Air) dies from having both of his lungs punctured. Cardinal Guidera (Fire) is burned alive, and Cardinal Baggia (Water) drowns in the Fountain of the Four Rivers. Then, the Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca is branded with the Illuminati Diamond‚Äîa diamond shape made of the words for the aforementioned elements (also ambigrammatic). It is later revealed that he had done this to himself. These brandings and murders also appear in the film adaptation of Angels & Demons, except Cardinal Baggia does not die; he is instead rescued from drowning and in the end becomes the new Pope. Also, the fifth brand in the film is not the elemental Illuminati Diamond, but rather the papal symbol of two crossed keys. =Avatar: The Last Airbender and The Legend of Korra= In the animated series Avatar: The Last Airbender and its sequel series, there are only four mystical martial arts, which allows certain people called \\"benders\\" to freely have control and manipulation of the four elements through real-life martial arts tradition: Waterbending, Firebending, Earthbending, and Airbending. These are more based on the elemental structure of the Western and/or the Japanese elements, without a style based around Aether/Void instead having the fifth bending element be spirit. However, there is some overlap of elements as Blood, Lightning, Plants, and Metal are all uniquely special sub-abilities of the other four main elements. Airbending is a martial arts-based ability that controls and manipulates the element of Air. It is primarily based around the real martial arts of Bagua Zhang. Airbending focuses on evading and avoiding attacks. Earthbending is a martial arts-based ability that controls and manipulates the element of Earth. It is primarily based around the real martial arts of Hung Ga, however there are exceptions like Toph who uses the Southern Praying Mantis Kung Fu. However, it is likely different due to the fact Toph has learned her Earthbending from the Badger-moles (Natural animal benders, and mentioned in the show as the first earthbenders). Unlike Airbending, Earthbending is based around withstanding attacks and holding one's ground. Toph discovers how to use earthbending to easily control and manipulate metal by focusing on its earthen impurities, and teaches this technique to other earthbenders, including her daughters Lin and Suyin. Firebending is a martial arts-based ability that controls and manipulates fire, flame and heat. It is primarily based on Northern Shaolin, here primarily the Northern Shaolin Style. A specialized form of Firebending can be used to control and manipulate lightning. This is done by dividing the yin from the yang of the electricity, like splitting positive and negative charges. The charge tries to merge again, much like a lightning bolt moves from one charged object to another (Like a positively charged cloud to the negatively charged ground or vice versa). Waterbending is a martial arts-based ability that controls and manipulates the element of water. It is primarily based on T'ai chi. Firebending opposes Waterbending, as the former prefers to attack first and hard until a weakness is found while the latter waits for the opponent to attack first and then redirects their strike. Whereas the other styles appear incapable of controlling and manipulating the various forms and phase of their native element, waterbenders can alter the phase of water, controlling and manipulating water in its solid (ice, snow, hail), liquid (pure water) and gaseous forms (mist, steam, clouds, fog, and water vapor), or even take liquid water from the air, plants, animals, or even humans. Some are even capable of controlling and manipulating others (by way of the rare and sinister ability of bloodbending) under the light of a full moon, when waterbenders are at their strongest and full potential. This is done by controlling the bodily fluids inside another's living body and thus controlling them to do the waterbender's bidding like a puppet. Spiritbending does not have a martial arts equivalent as it is rarely used. This style controls the spirit or chi of others, making them capable of removing bending from another. This bending style is only able to be used by the avatar, the master of all elements, and isn't used for fighting like the other elements. Each season, or book, of Avatar: The Last Airbender is named after one of the classical elements: water, earth, and fire respectively. The first season of the Legend of Korra corresponds to the fourth element, air. The second season of ‚ÄúLegend of Korra‚Äù is named after the fifth element spirits. =Beast King GoLion/Voltron= Within Beast King GoLion (and its American counterpart Voltron), the Lions are each powered by a different element of the Wu Xing: *the Black Lion ‚Äì Metal *the Red Lion ‚Äì Fire *the Green Lion ‚Äì Wood *the Blue Lion ‚Äì Water *the Yellow Lion ‚Äì Earth =Bionicle= A line of construction toys from Lego. In its storyline, the main characters ‚Äì the Toa ‚Äì are warrior- like beings (usually depicted as a team of six) who each represent and possess the ability to create, manipulate and absorb an element, namely one of the six \\"primary\\" elements: Fire, Water, Air, Earth, Ice and Stone. Toa and other beings of less common \\"secondary\\" elements are later introduced, these include Light, Shadow, Gravity, Sonics (referring to sound), Lightning, Iron, the Green (referring to plant life), Plasma, Magnetism and Psionics (referring to mental abilities). The Toa's counterparts ‚Äì the villager-like Matoran and their Turaga elders ‚Äì possess innate or weaker elemental abilities, while all of them live as tribes in environments associated with their respective elements. Many other species in their universe also possess elemental powers. In a later storyline featuring a different society, the characters of the Agori villagers and Glatorian warriors do not have elemental abilities, but live in tribes associated with the elements of Fire, Water, Jungle, Ice, Rock, Sand, Iron and Earth. In a reboot of the story, the primary elements of Fire, Water, Earth, Ice and Stone are retained, however, Air has been replaced with Jungle, which now encompasses both wind and plant-based powers. =Captain Planet= Captain Planet and the Planeteers, an animated series from the early 1990s, is about five teenagers, each with a magic ring that controls an element. When their powers combine, they create a superhero named Captain Planet, who uses the power of all of the elements. Each Planeteer's personality (and sometimes, appearance) reflects their element. The level headed, brown skinned Kwame (Earth) functions as the leader, and holds the group together. Growing up in an African village, he knows much about the land and plant life. Wheeler (Fire), who has red hair and is more temperamental and impulsive, acts as the team's fighting spirit. Linka (Wind) has a passion for bird life, while Gi (Water) is a student of marine biology and has skills in water sports. The fifth element is named as \\"Heart\\", and Ma-Ti's ring controls it. Ma-Ti, in tune with wildlife, becomes empathic with both animals and people, and can communicate telepathically with his teammates. Whereas the other Planeteers give Captain Planet his powers, Ma-Ti's ring creates his persona. =Castle Crashers= Castle Crashers is a video game on the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC (Microsoft Windows and OS X) about knights and princesses. The four main characters each represent and use different elements. The Red Knight represents Lightning. The Blue Knight represents Ice. The Green Knight represents Poison. The Orange Knight represents Fire. =Challengers of the Unknown= In the comic book series Challengers of the Unknown, each of the four original members of the team represent one of the Greek elements. Ace Morgan is a pilot (air), redheaded Red Ryan is a daredevil (fire), Prof Haley is a deep-sea explorer (water), and Rocky Davis is wrestler (earth). While the symbolic relationship between the individuals and elements can be seen, it never really played a strong role in the development of the characters' personalities, which took many twists and turns unrelated to any archetypes. =Digimon= The eponymous creatures in Digimon often have attacks and characteristics that relate to an element. This theme was perhaps most emphasized in the fourth season, when the Ten Legendary Warriors were based on elements of fire, light, ice, wind, thunder, earth, water, steel, wood and darkness. The second and third seasons introduced the Digimon Sovereigns, which are based on the Wu Xing animals. For unknown reasons, Qinglongmon's element was water and Xuanwumon's was wood, whereas in Wu Xing tradition, the reverse is true. =Dungeons & Dragons= In the Dungeons & Dragons family of role-playing games, the idea of the Greek elements are used as the symbolic building blocks of reality; the four Elemental Planes form a metaphorical ring around the \\"Prime Material Plane\\" that contains all the \\"everyday\\" game settings (Faerun, Greyhawk, et cetera). In all editions of the game there is the addition of a Positive (Creative/Constructive) Energy Plane \\"above\\" the Elemental and Prime planes, as well as a Negative (Destructive/Necromantic) Energy Plane \\"below\\" them. In the more complex cosmos of the 2nd Edition and beyond there are other planes where the six major elemental planes adjoin each other. The Paraelemental Planes manifested where the elemental planes overlap ‚Äì Fire and Earth become Magma, Earth and Water form Ooze, Water and Air are joined as Ice, and Air and Fire unite as Smoke (the opposing pairs of Fire/Water and Earth/Air do not touch). The Quasielemental Planes were formed where the Positive or Negative Planes bordered the elemental planes; they express either the abundance or intensification of the element's nature, or its destruction or absence. The positive Quasielemental expressions of Earth, Water, Air and Fire are Minerals, Steam, Lightning and Radiance, respectively; their negative counterparts are Dust, Salt, Vacuum and Ash. =Earth, Wind & Fire= The popular R&B; musical group Earth, Wind & Fire is so named because founder Maurice White's sign was Sagittarius, whose primary elemental quality is Fire (hot & dry), but whose north and south seasonal qualities are Earth (cold & dry), and Air (hot & wet). =Elemental Assassin= In Jennifer Estep's Elemental Assassin series, the four \\"primary elements\\" are Air, Fire, Ice, and Stone. To be considered a true elemental, one must be able to manipulate one of these substances. Despite this, there are other, rarer elements derived from the primary four: Metal (derived from Stone), Electricity (derived from Air), Water (derived from Ice), and Acid (derived from Fire). The rarest elemental of all, however, is one who is gifted in multiple elements, like series protagonist Gin Blanco (Stone and Ice). = Encantadia = The Brilyantes are fictional gemstones in the Filipino fantasy television series Encantadia as well as its 2016 requel. They are the elemental gems that holds the balance in Encantadia. Each gem manifests the classical elements: aether, fire, air, water, and earth. The tranquility and future of Encantadia rests on these gemstones. In both series, each Brilyante are being carefully kept by each kingdom in Encantadia. The kingdom of fairies, Lireo, in the east of Encantadia, is the keeper of Brilyante ng Hangin (Gemstone of Air). Adamya, the kingdom of elves in the south is the keeper of Brilyante ng Tubig (Gemstone of Water). Sapiro, the northern kingdom of valiant warriors and healers, kept the Brilyante ng Lupa (Gemstone of Earth). Hathoria, the kingdom of proud and violent blacksmiths and orcs in the west, is the keeper the Brilyante ng Apoy (Gemstone of Fire). But after the Hathoria attempted to seize the all the gemstones, they are turned-over to Queen Mine-a of Lireo for safekeeping. Later, the four daughters of Queen Mine-a became the keeper of these gemstones. =Fantastic Four= In the comic book series Fantastic Four, each of the four characters have powers that relate to the Greek elements. The two most obvious links are the Human Torch (whose fire control power is best expressed through the image of him as a burning man) and the Thing (who resembles a living being of rock and stone). Mister Fantastic, while not having water-based powers, does have a fluid form. The Invisible Woman's powers of invisibility and force fields evoke the unseen forces of wind and air. This is especially true in Neil Gaiman's Marvel 1602, where the Invisible Woman is both permanently invisible and weightless. It should also be mentioned the two obvious elemental personalities (the Human Torch and the Thing) tend to have personality traits people tend to associate with their own elements. Johnny the human Torch is extremely hot-headed and impulsive, with a brash personality, contrast this to Ben the Thing who is more sullen, dependable and strong. Perhaps the closest character to embodying Water in the Fantastic Four is their companion (and sometimes rival) Namor the Sub-Mariner, who becomes invincible when underwater, can breathe both above and below the surface, and rules Atlantis. =Final Fantasy= The Final Fantasy role- playing video games frequently feature the four Greek elements as major natural forces, with each element often being associated with a crystal that serves as the nexus of its presence in the world. In installments starring Warriors of Light as protagonists, each Warrior is generally associated with one of these four elements. Less frequently, Final Fantasy also associates each of the four Greek elements with a character trait; wind is associated with an adventuresome spirit, water with devotion, fire with courage, and earth with hope. The elements of light and darkness also frequently feature prominently in Final Fantasy. Crystals in the Final Fantasy series are generally associated with light in addition to their individual Greek elements, but some installments feature a set of dark counterparts to the elemental crystals, as well. In addition to the Greek elements, Final Fantasy also prominently features ice and lightning, which form a separate trinity of elements most commonly found in the magic spells Fire, Thunder, and Blizzard. Certain creatures in the Final Fantasy series will also come in fire-, ice-, and lightning-themed variants in certain installments. =Frozen II= An enchanted forest to the north is the home of four elemental spirits. Bruni the magical salamander is the fire spirit, Gale is the air spirit in the form of a tornado, a group of rock giants are the Earth spirits, and the legendary Nokk is the water spirit. The main character of the film, Elsa, represents the fifth spirit. =Ghost= The Swedish heavy metal band Ghost assign elemental symbols to each of the masked instrumentalists, known collectively as The Nameless Ghouls. They are: * Fire: Lead Guitar * Water: Bass Guitar * Air: Keyboards * Earth: Drums * Aether (or Quintessence): Rhythm Guitar =Harry Potter= In the Harry Potter series, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where most of the books' plots are set, is divided into four houses: Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Each of the four houses corresponds roughly to one of the classical Greek elements. Ravenclaw's high tower and representative symbol of the eagle correspond to the element of air. Hufflepuff, whose symbol is the badger, corresponds to earth, and their common room is located under the school. The fluid snake symbol of Slytherin corresponds to water, and their common room is located directly under the lake. The symbol of Gryffindor is the lion, exemplifying bravery, quick temper, and boldness, symbolized by fire. =Heroes of Might and Magic III= In Heroes of Might and Magic III, magic spells and skills were divided into schools of magic with each school corresponding to a classical element. Representative spells include *Implosion, Meteor Shower and Slow from the school of Earth Magic *Armageddon, Inferno and Curse from the school of Fire Magic *Frost Ring, Clone and Heal from the school of Water Magic *Chain Lightning, Counter Strike and Haste from the school of Air Magic Progression in proficiency (Basic ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Expert) in magic skill increases some aspect of the spells cast in the corresponding school of magic (e.g. higher damage, increased effect, longer duration, lower mana cost etc.). =Jackie Chan Adventures= In the KidsWB series, Jackie Chan Adventures, eight of Jackie's enemies were Chinese demons who derived their magical abilities from eight elemental forces of nature: Wind, Water, the Moon, Sky, Mountain, Thunder, Earth, and Fire. =Keeper of the Lost Cities= Keeper of the Lost Cities In the Keeper of the Lost Cities series by Shannon Messenger, several abilities that the elves can have include Frosters (cryokinetics), Gusters (aerokinetics), Hydrokinetics, and Pyrokinetics. The elves that manifested any one of these abilities struggled to maintain control of these highly volatile forces of nature. Due to the uncontrollable danger of fire, Pyrokinesis was banned. Also, some specialized shades can control Shadwoflux. (one of the two secret elements Shadwoflux and Quintessence) =Kingdom Hearts= The original thirteen members of Organization XIII each have a designated element that they control. The first four named members to appear in the series Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories: Axel, Larxene, Vexen, and Marluxia, control the series' standard four magic elements of fire, thunder, ice, and flower (in a death- attribute counterpart to the Cure spell) respectively. The range of elements used by the group is later expanded to include more traditional elements such as earth (Lexaeus), water (Demyx), and wind (Xaldin), cosmic elements like space (Xigbar) and time (Luxord), as well as more eclectic elements such as moon (Sa√Øx) and illusion (Zexion). Even the principal forces in the series' universe are present with Roxas, the youngest member who controls light and Xemnas, the group's leader who controls nothingness. Each of these elements is represented in Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days by a negative status ailment that is resisted by the element's respective member (e.g. the flower-elemental \\"blind\\" status effect, which is resisted by Marluxia). The classical elements air, earth and water are also represented by the trio of Sora, Riku and Kairi, through the kanji for their names, and especially the trio of Ventus, Terra and Aqua, who represent their respective element through their names, their starting weapons and several of their special abilities. =Mastodon= Each of the first four albums by the heavy metal band Mastodon is based on one of the classical elements: Remission is based on fire, Leviathan is based on water, Blood Mountain is based on earth, and Crack the Skye is based on aether. There is no album based on air, as the band dropped this concept with their fifth album The Hunter. =Magic the Gathering= In Magic the Gathering, a card game, there are 5 magic colors, based on both Western and Eastern elemental traditions; White: aether (quintessence), Blue: air and water, Black: nether, Red: earth and fire, and Green: wood. =Max Steel= In the 2013 reboot of Max Steel, there are four lizard-like creatures known as elementors. Each elementor is taken from one of the four classical elements and have appearances and powers based on their respective elements: The earth elementor is made of rock, has geokinesis and can repair itself, the fire elementor is made of flaming lava rock, has pyrokinesis and is faster than the others, the water elementor is liquid and has hydrokinesis and the air elementor is made of clouds and wind and is the most powerful (having flight and aerokinesis). The four of them can combine into a single, four-armed being with the combined powers of all of them. In Season 2, a fifth, Metal elementor is added and is the strongest and smartest of the group. It has magnetic powers similar to Magneto and can liquify/solidify itself. =Naruto= In the manga and anime series Naruto, ninjas use the ability of Chakra (mixing of mental energy and physical energy to create a supernatural force of pure life energy, manna, chakra, chi, Quintessence, Aether) to perform jutsu (ninja techniques that allow the use of superpowers or martial arts). As depicted in the series, Chakra has elemental aspects, with the five elements' comparative strengths and abilities resembling the creative/destructive cycle of the Chinese elements. The cycle goes from Air to Lightning to Earth, and Water to Fire before returning to Air/Wind again, each element much, much stronger than the one after it. In the world of Naruto, there are certain people who can mix elemental aspect into new elemental jutsu. So far, expressions of this shown are ice, wood, lava, storm, boil, dust, heat, explosion and magnetism. The ice mixes water and wind, wood mixes water and earth, lava mixes earth and fire, storm mixes water and lightning, boil mixes fire and water, dust mixes earth, wind and fire. There are also elements unique to the anime and movie medium, among them crystal, darkness, steel and swift. This is similar to the building block idea of Dungeons and Dragons, which also links with ideas of primitive man that all things are made up of classical element. Within the series, some countries are named after the elements (like the \\"Land of Fire\\" where Naruto lives). There are also five strong and powerful ninja villages who exhibit dominance over the smaller villages, each of which is based on the five elements above. Each holds a leader ninja who is the only one to take the name of shadow (Kage). =Ninjago= In the Lego Ninjago theme, the land of Ninjago was created by four elemental weapons: The Scythe of Quakes, the Nunchucks of Lightning, the Shurikens of Ice and the Sword of Fire. The TV series Masters of Spinjitzu focuses on four ninjas, each wielding one of the four elements and possessing personalities that mirror them. *Cole (the Black Ninja of Earth), whose abilities include super-strength, terrakinesis and invulnerability, is portrayed as the team's leader and muscle who shows no fear. *Kai (the Red Ninja of Fire), whose abilities include flight and pyrokinesis, is somewhat hotheaded, violent and impulsive, but cares fiercely for his friends. *Jay (the Blue Ninja of Lightning), whose abilities include flight, teleportation, and electrokinesis, is the team's chatty and fast- talking jokester. *Finally, Zane (the White Ninja of Ice), whose primary ability is cryokinesis, is intelligent, serious, and calm. During the first season, main character Lloyd Garmadon joins the team (and eventually becomes their new leader) as the Green Ninja, the Master of all Four Elements; in addition to gaining the other ninja's powers, he can also fire green energy blasts. In Season 2, he acquires Golden Power, which grants him nigh omnipotence, but has a majority of it stripped by the Overlord. Upon dividing the rest of his power among the four ninja, Lloyd is left with his green energy. Season 4 reveals that there are several other elemental powers out there, including Metal, Gravity, Nature (specifically Plant-Life), Smoke, Sound, Form, Poison (also known as Toxicity), Light, Shadow, Speed, Mind, Water, and Amber (the ability to absorb or replicate other elemental powers). In Season 5, the Element of Wind is introduced, and the current Master of Water is revealed to be Kai's sister Nya. Coincidentally, Nya's relationships with the original four ninjas corresponds to how water reacts with their particular elements: she is able to quench Kai's hot temper, she is Jay's girlfriend, she can erode Cole's hard exterior to reveal his soft side, and she shares interests with Zane. In the seventh season, the Element of Time is introduced and serves as the story's primary focus. =Nowhere Boys= In the teen adventure series Nowhere Boys, the four main characters each represent an element-‚ÄîFelix with the power of fire, Andy with the power of water, Sam with the power of air and Jake with the power of earth. Felix later discovers that his younger brother, Oscar is the missing fifth element needed for them to return to their own universe. That element is spirit. =Ragnarok Online= In the MMORPG Ragnarok Online characters, monsters and magic skills maybe be of one of 10 elements: Neutral, Fire, Earth, Wind, Water, Poison, Holy, Shadow, Ghost or Undead. =Ronin Warriors= In the anime series Ronin Warriors, all of the heroes and villains are representative of different concepts of virtue as well as the classical elements (in the case of the series' heroes) or seasons (in the case of the villains). =Sailor Moon= Most of the Sailor Guardians characters in the Sailor Moon manga metaseries have elemental powers, some being inspired by Chinese elements (the Wu Xing) and some by Roman mythology. These are derived from the Japanese names given to their planets; even in civilian form, each superheroine has a surname that reflects her planet and her tremendously powerful Sailor powers. Four of the Sailor Senshi (Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, and Venus) have elemental abilities based directly on their planets: Mercury for water, ice, and fog, Mars for fire, flame and heat, Jupiter for lightning, rocks, and plants, and Venus for metal and light. They also take inspiration from Greek mythology, especially Jupiter (lightning) and Venus (love). The other set of four (Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, and Saturn) also have powers based on their planet names, but since the first three were not known from antiquity, their names derive from the Western names and therefore from Roman myth (resulting in \\"sky king,\\" \\"sea king,\\" and \\"underworld king\\" respectively). Sailor Uranus uses the forces of the air and wind, Sailor Neptune uses the forces of the sea and ocean, and Sailor Pluto is the Guardian of Space-Time and the Underworld. Sailor Saturn's element is given as earth, which corresponds to mythological harvest symbolism and to her vastly dark powers over death and destruction, and rebirth. The main character, Sailor Moon, along with the younger Sailor Chibi Moon, use elemental powers of pure moonlight. =Slugterra= In the 2012 television series Slugterra, there are creatures described as slugs, which originated from 5 elemental slugs, representing the elements of Earth, Fire, Air, Water and Energy. The various species of slugs are classified into these elements, or even subcategories of them. Earth is categorised into Earth, Metal and Plant; Air is categorised into Air and Toxic; Water is categorised into Water and Ice and Energy is categorised into Light, Psychic and Electricity. Fire is the only element without sub-categories. Additionally when slugs are corrupted into \\"ghouls\\" (slugs that have been mutated by the life-sucking \\"dark water\\") they are categorised into \\"Shadow\\". If any of the original elemental slugs are corrupted, it will spread to all the slugs its element originated. The only cure is to reform the ghouled elementals and fire them simultaneously. =Star Trek: The Next Generation= In the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \\"Thine Own Self\\", Data is stranded on a pre-industrial planet where the inhabitants are still taught that the elements consist of rock, fire, sky, and water. =Super Sentai/Power Rangers= Several teams of Super Sentai and Power Rangers have used the classical elements thematically, with each Ranger having powers related to one element. Normally, the Red Ranger represents fire, and the Blue Ranger water. For example, the Red Turbo Ranger and the Red Lightspeed Ranger have had Zords based on fire trucks, while the Blue Aquitian Ranger had a water-based attack. Gosei Sentai Dairanger drew heavily from Chinese mythology, and five of the Mythical Qi Beasts correspond to the Wu Xing. In Seijuu Sentai Gingaman and Power Rangers Lost Galaxy, the five Rangers represented fire (Red), water (Blue), wind (Green), lightning (Yellow) and flora (Pink), with earth (the Black Knight/the Magna Defender) added later. The elements in Ninpuu Sentai Hurricanger are air (Red), earth (Yellow), water (Blue), with Kuwaga and Kabuto both wielding the power of lightning. The last two became the Thunder Rangers in Power Rangers Ninja Storm, sharing the element thunder, with the Green Samurai Ranger being a non- elemental (his power was dubbed \\"Green Samurai Power\\"). The elemental theme was here used more extensively than in previous series, and the Rangers‚Äô attacks and fighting styles often reflect it. In Mahou Sentai Magiranger and Power Rangers Mystic Force, MagiRed (the Red Ranger) and Wolzard (the Wolf Warrior) share the element fire. The other Rangers have powers based on thunder (Yellow), water (Blue), air (Pink), earth (Green), ice (White), and light/the sun (MagiShine/the Solaris Knight). In Power Rangers: Samurai and its follow up season Super Samurai, the five rangers each represent the classical elements, albeit with forest in place of aether: fire (red), water (blue), sky (pink), earth (yellow) and forest (green). The Red Ranger has also shown use of lightning. Later on when the gold ranger is added, he harnesses the element of light. The use of elements is not restricted to the protagonists. In Kyuukyuu Sentai GoGo-V, the demons Zylpheeza, Drop, Cobolda and Venus (Diabolico, Impus, Loki and Vypra in Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue) each represent one of the four elements. In both versions, all monsters are affiliated with one of them, and relate to the same element. =Swordquest= Atari's 1982‚Äì1983 Swordquest video game series were four video games with each title representing one of the four classical elements. They were released in order from least-to-most important, in life's necessities, concerning the classical elements. The fourth and final game was never released. *Swordquest: Earthworld *Swordquest: Fireworld *Swordquest: Waterworld *Swordquest: Airworld =Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 series)= In the 2003 series of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, The Shredder has control over five mystical beings referred to as the Mystic Ninja. Each of the Mystic ninjas represent and have control over one of the basic elements: Earth, Fire, Water, Wind and Metal. The Mystic Ninja serve as guards to the Shredders throne room. They are held under the Shredders control with a mystic amulet known as the Heart of Tengu. The Mystics are later set free when they manage to have the amulet destroyed, and it is revealed that they are, in truth, heralds of and ancient Tengu demon known as the Original Shredder. The heralds are later destroyed by the Turtles and their allies. =Tenkai Knights= In episode 27 of Tenkai Knights, the heroes known as Bravenwolf, Tributon, Valorn and Lydendor received new forms and powers based on the elements of fire, ice, earth and lightning. =Xiaolin Showdown= In the KidsWB series, Xiaolin Showdown, the four main characters were monk children of the four elements: Omi (water), Raimundo (wind), Kimiko (fire), Clay (earth). In the first season, the call out their element and their fighting skill is increased dramatically. In the second season, they're able to bring their element into a physical form performing a fighting stance. For example, Omi's Tsunami Strike where he spins his entire body to allow water to fly everywhere. In the third season, the monks are promoted to Wudai Warriors. The promotion apparently unlocked their ability to bring the elements into physical form, but they can control them without any limitations. The base of the show revolves around collecting mystical items called Shen Gong Wu on which some of them are able to conjure elements. =W.I.T.C.H.= The Italian comic book series and its later cartoon series W.I.T.C.H. is centered on five girls who receive magical powers to fight evil in fantasy worlds parallel to their own, with each girl, now a \\"guardian\\", being able to produce one of the four classical elements from nothing as well as control, manipulate and mentally communicate with it. A fifth element, Quintessence, is later revealed to be the element controlled by the fifth guardian and is described as \\"the stuff of life\\". As such, Quintessence manifests in the form of lightning that contains pure life energy that can create sentience in inanimate objects. =Wizard101= Wizard101 is an RPG for PC. All attacks and defenses are based on some traditional elements as well as other additional elements. The practitioner of each element has a different general play style. Fire Wizards (Pyromancers) focus on spells that deal damage over time; Storm Wizards (Diviners) have spells that have high damage, but low accuracy, while also having low health; Ice Wizards (Thaumaturges) focus on damage absorption and defense, having the highest health; Life Wizards (Theurgists) are healers, with their spells having the highest unchanged accuracy; Myth Wizards (Conjurers) mainly summon other beings to help them in battle; Death Wizards (Necromancers) have spells that not only damage enemies, but also heal themselves; Balance Wizards (Sorcerers) are unspecialized, focusing on buffing themselves or others.

A racket is therefore generally a repeated or continuous organized criminal operation or enterprise. Conducting a racket is racketeering. However, according to the original and more specific definition, a racket or racketeering usually involves extortion or criminal coercion. Originally and often still specifically, a \\"racket\\" in this sense refers to an organized criminal act in which the perpetrators fraudulently offer a service that will not be put into effect, offer a service to solve a nonexistent problem, or offer a service that solves a problem that would not exist without the racket. Particularly, the potential problem may be caused by the same party that offers to solve it, but that fact may be concealed, with the specific intent to engender continual patronage for this party. The traditional and most common example of a racket is the \\"protection racket\\", which promises to protect the target business or person from dangerous individuals in the neighborhood and then either collects the money or causes damage to the business until the owner pays. The racket exists as both the problem and its solution, and it is used as a method of extortion. However, the term \\"racket\\" has expanded in definition over time and may now be used less strictly to refer to any continuous or repeated illegal organized crime operation, including those that do not necessarily involve fraudulent practices or extortion. For example, \\"racket\\" may refer to the \\"numbers racket\\" or the \\"drug racket\\", neither of which generally or necessarily involve extortion, coercion, fraud, or deception with regard to the intended clientele. Racketeering is most often associated with organized crime, and the term was coined by the Employers' Association of Chicago in June 1927 in a statement about the influence of organized crime in the Teamsters union.David Witwer, \\"'The Most Racketeer-Ridden Union in America': The Problem of Corruption in the Teamsters Union During the 1930s\\", in Corrupt Histories, Emmanuel Kreike and William Chester Jordan, eds., University of Rochester Press, 2004. Specifically, a racket was defined by this coinage as being a service, such as protection (see below) which calls forth its own demand, and would not have been needed otherwise.David Witwer, \\"'The Most Racketeer-Ridden Union in America': The Problem of Corruption in the Teamsters Union During the 1930s\\", in Corrupt Histories, Emmanuel Kreike and William Chester Jordan, eds., University of Rochester Press, 2004.  Examples  Examples of crimes that may be alleged to be part of a pattern of racketeering activity include * A protection racket is a form of extortion whereby racketeers offer to \\"protect\\" property from damage in exchange for a fee, while also being responsible, in part or in whole, for the property damage. * A fencing racket is an operation specializing in the resale of stolen goods. * A numbers racket is any unauthorized lottery or illegal gambling operation. * Money laundering and other creative accounting practices that are misused in ways to disguise sources of illegal funds. * Organized, coordinated, and repeated or regular theft operations, including: burglary, home invasion, robbery, identity theft, art theft, auto theft and carjacking * Organized retail crime, shoplifting, and copyright infringement (including the sale of counterfeit goods and art forgery) * Fraud and embezzlement operations, including: credit card fraud, check fraud, health care fraud, insurance fraud, mail and wire fraud, securities fraud, bank fraud, mortgage fraud, skimming (fraud), electoral fraud, confidence tricks, and bid rigging * Kidnapping and ransom rings * Contract killing or murder-for-hire services * Bribery and police corruption * Organized academic dishonesty by school administrators * Loan sharking rackets * Computer crimes * Drug trafficking * Arms trafficking * Extortion rackets * Blackmail operations * Counterfeit money operations * Organized prostitution operations and commercial sexual exploitation of children * Tax evasion and cigarette smuggling rackets * Organized witness tampering and intimidation * Skimming (casinos) * Operating chop shops * Illegal gambling, bookmaking, and match fixing * Human trafficking rings * People smuggling rings * Organ trafficking rings * Rum-running rackets (or alcohol smuggling) and moonshine operations * Criminal operation of otherwise ostensibly legal operations, such as strip clubs, casinos, nightclubs or bars, pornographic film studios, social clubs, construction companies, salvage yards, auto shops, and waste management firms * Political corruption * Corporate corruption * Bid rigging and price fixing * Labor corruption or labor racketeering * No-show jobs * Poaching and overfishing * Illegal logging, illegal construction, and illegal mining * Dog fighting, cockfighting, and bullfighting RICO Act On October 15, 1970, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (18 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 1961‚Äì1968), commonly referred to as the \\"RICO Act\\", became United States law. The RICO Act allowed law enforcement to charge a person or group of people with racketeering, defined as committing multiple violations of certain varieties within a ten-year period. The purpose of the RICO Act was stated as \\"the elimination of the infiltration of organized crime and racketeering into legitimate organizations operating in interstate commerce\\". S.Rep. No. 617, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 76 (1968). However, the statute is sufficiently broad to encompass illegal activities relating to any enterprise affecting interstate or foreign commerce. Section 1961(10) of Title 18 provides that the Attorney General of the United States may designate any department or agency to conduct investigations authorized by the RICO statute and such department or agency may use the investigative provisions of the statute or the investigative power of such department or agency otherwise conferred by law. Absent a specific designation by the Attorney General, jurisdiction to conduct investigations for violations of 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1962 lies with the agency having jurisdiction over the violations constituting the pattern of racketeering activity listed in 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1961. In the US, civil racketeering laws are also used in federal and state courts.

Now let P1 and P2 be the two points on L whose distance from K is the same as the distance from A to K. The locus of such points P1 and P2 is then the strophoid of C with respect to the pole O and fixed point A. Note that AP1 and AP2 are at right angles in this construction. In the special case where C is a line, A lies on C, and O is not on C, then the curve is called an oblique strophoid. If, in addition, OA is perpendicular to C then the curve is called a right strophoid, or simply strophoid by some authors. The right strophoid is also called the logocyclic curve or foliate. EquationsPolar coordinates= Let the curve C be given by r = f(\\\\theta), where the origin is taken to be O. Let A be the point (a, b). If K = (r \\\\cos\\\\theta,\\\\ r \\\\sin\\\\theta) is a point on the curve the distance from K to A is :d = \\\\sqrt{(r \\\\cos\\\\theta - a)^2 + (r \\\\sin\\\\theta - b)^2} = \\\\sqrt{(f(\\\\theta) \\\\cos\\\\theta - a)^2 + (f(\\\\theta) \\\\sin\\\\theta - b)^2}. The points on the line OK have polar angle \\\\theta, and the points at distance d from K on this line are distance f(\\\\theta) \\\\pm d from the origin. Therefore, the equation of the strophoid is given by :r = f(\\\\theta) \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{(f(\\\\theta) \\\\cos\\\\theta - a)^2 + (f(\\\\theta) \\\\sin\\\\theta - b)^2} =Cartesian coordinates= Let C be given parametrically by (x(t), y(t)). Let A be the point (a, b) and let O be the point (p, q). Then, by a straightforward application of the polar formula, the strophoid is given parametrically by: :u(t) = p + (x(t)-p)(1 \\\\pm n(t)),\\\\ v(t) = q + (y(t)-q)(1 \\\\pm n(t)), where :n(t) = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{(x(t)-a)^2+(y(t)-b)^2}{(x(t)-p)^2+(y(t)-q)^2}}. =An alternative polar formula= The complex nature of the formulas given above limits their usefulness in specific cases. There is an alternative form which is sometimes simpler to apply. This is particularly useful when C is a sectrix of Maclaurin with poles O and A. Let O be the origin and A be the point (a, 0). Let K be a point on the curve, \\\\theta the angle between OK and the x-axis, and \\\\vartheta the angle between AK and the x-axis. Suppose \\\\vartheta can be given as a function \\\\theta, say \\\\vartheta = l(\\\\theta). Let \\\\psi be the angle at K so \\\\psi = \\\\vartheta - \\\\theta. We can determine r in terms of l using the law of sines. Since :{r \\\\over \\\\sin \\\\vartheta} = {a \\\\over \\\\sin \\\\psi},\\\\ r = a \\\\frac {\\\\sin \\\\vartheta}{\\\\sin \\\\psi} = a \\\\frac {\\\\sin l(\\\\theta)}{\\\\sin (l(\\\\theta) - \\\\theta)}. Let P1 and P2 be the points on OK that are distance AK from K, numbering so that \\\\psi = \\\\angle P_1KA and \\\\pi-\\\\psi = \\\\angle AKP_2. \\\\triangle P_1KA is isosceles with vertex angle \\\\psi, so the remaining angles, \\\\angle AP_1K and \\\\angle KAP_1, are (\\\\pi-\\\\psi)/2. The angle between AP1 and the x-axis is then :l_1(\\\\theta) = \\\\vartheta + \\\\angle KAP_1 = \\\\vartheta + (\\\\pi-\\\\psi)/2 = \\\\vartheta + (\\\\pi - \\\\vartheta + \\\\theta)/2 = (\\\\vartheta+\\\\theta+\\\\pi)/2. By a similar argument, or simply using the fact that AP1 and AP2 are at right angles, the angle between AP2 and the x-axis is then :l_2(\\\\theta) = (\\\\vartheta+\\\\theta)/2. The polar equation for the strophoid can now be derived from l1 and l2 from the formula above: :r_1=a \\\\frac {\\\\sin l_1(\\\\theta)}{\\\\sin (l_1(\\\\theta) - \\\\theta)} = a \\\\frac {\\\\sin ((l(\\\\theta)+\\\\theta+\\\\pi)/2)}{\\\\sin ((l(\\\\theta)+\\\\theta+\\\\pi)/2 - \\\\theta)} = a \\\\frac{\\\\cos ((l(\\\\theta)+\\\\theta)/2)}{\\\\cos ((l(\\\\theta)-\\\\theta)/2)} :r_2=a \\\\frac {\\\\sin l_2(\\\\theta)}{\\\\sin (l_2(\\\\theta) - \\\\theta)} = a \\\\frac {\\\\sin ((l(\\\\theta)+\\\\theta)/2)}{\\\\sin ((l(\\\\theta)+\\\\theta)/2 - \\\\theta)} = a \\\\frac{\\\\sin((l(\\\\theta)+\\\\theta)/2)}{\\\\sin((l(\\\\theta)-\\\\theta)/2)} C is a sectrix of Maclaurin with poles O and A when l is of the form q \\\\theta + \\\\theta_0, in that case l1 and l2 will have the same form so the strophoid is either another sectrix of Maclaurin or a pair of such curves. In this case there is also a simple polar equation for the polar equation if the origin is shifted to the right by a. Specific casesOblique strophoids= Let C be a line through A. Then, in the notation used above, l(\\\\theta) = \\\\alpha where \\\\alpha is a constant. Then l_1(\\\\theta) = (\\\\theta + \\\\alpha + \\\\pi)/2 and l_2(\\\\theta) = (\\\\theta + \\\\alpha)/2. The polar equations of the resulting strophoid, called an oblique strphoid, with the origin at O are then :r = a \\\\frac{\\\\cos ((\\\\alpha+\\\\theta)/2)}{\\\\cos ((\\\\alpha-\\\\theta)/2)} and :r = a \\\\frac{\\\\sin ((\\\\alpha+\\\\theta)/2)}{\\\\sin ((\\\\alpha-\\\\theta)/2)}. It's easy to check that these equations describe the same curve. Moving the origin to A (again, see Sectrix of Maclaurin) and replacing ‚àía with a produces :r=a\\\\frac{\\\\sin(2\\\\theta-\\\\alpha)}{\\\\sin(\\\\theta-\\\\alpha)}, and rotating by \\\\alpha in turn produces :r=a\\\\frac{\\\\sin(2\\\\theta+\\\\alpha)}{\\\\sin(\\\\theta)}. In rectangular coordinates, with a change of constant parameters, this is :y(x^2+y^2)=b(x^2-y^2)+2cxy. This is a cubic curve and, by the expression in polar coordinates it is rational. It has a crunode at (0, 0) and the line y=b is an asymptote. =The right strophoid= A right strophoid Putting \\\\alpha = \\\\pi/2 in :r=a\\\\frac{\\\\sin(2\\\\theta-\\\\alpha)}{\\\\sin(\\\\theta-\\\\alpha)} gives :r=a\\\\frac{\\\\cos 2\\\\theta}{\\\\cos \\\\theta} = a(2\\\\cos\\\\theta-\\\\sec\\\\theta). This is called the right strophoid and corresponds to the case where C is the y-axis, A is the origin, and O is the point (a,0). The Cartesian equation is :y^2 = x^2(a-x)/(a+x). The curve resembles the Folium of Descartes and the line x = ‚àía is an asymptote to two branches. The curve has two more asymptotes, in the plane with complex coordinates, given by :x\\\\pm iy = -a. =Circles= Let C be a circle through O and A, where O is the origin and A is the point (a, 0). Then, in the notation used above, l(\\\\theta) = \\\\alpha+\\\\theta where \\\\alpha is a constant. Then l_1(\\\\theta) = \\\\theta + (\\\\alpha + \\\\pi)/2 and l_2(\\\\theta) = \\\\theta + \\\\alpha/2. The polar equations of the resulting strophoid, called an oblique strophoid, with the origin at O are then :r = a \\\\frac{\\\\cos (\\\\theta+\\\\alpha/2)}{\\\\cos (\\\\alpha/2)} and :r = a \\\\frac{\\\\sin (\\\\theta+\\\\alpha/2)}{\\\\sin (\\\\alpha/2)}. These are the equations of the two circles which also pass through O and A and form angles of \\\\pi/4 with C at these points.

The University of Natal no longer exists as a distinct legal entity, as it was incorporated into the University of KwaZulu-Natal on 1 January 2004. It was founded in 1910 as the Natal University College in Pietermaritzburg and expanded to include a campus in Durban in 1931. In 1947, the university opened a medical school for non-white students in Durban. The Pietermaritzburg campus was known for its agricultural engineering programmes, hence the nickname \\"the farmers\\" whilst the Durban campus was known as \\"the engineers,\\" as it concentrated on other engineering programmes. The Council of the University of Natal voted on 31 May 2002 to offer the post of Vice-Chancellor and University Principal to world-renowned medical scientist and former Medical Research Council President - Professor Malegapuru Makgoba who assumed office on the 1 September 2002. He was entrusted with leading the University of Natal into the merger with the University of Durban-Westville. In so doing, he became the last Vice- Chancellor of the University of Natal. Professor Makgoba succeeded Professor Brenda Gourley as Vice-Chancellor. Brenda Gourley, a qualified chartered accountant, was the second last vice-chancellor of the University of Natal. Her appointment at the university in 1994 was an historical event in South Africa. She was the first woman in South Africa to be appointed as a vice- chancellor of a South African university. The Maritime law programme based at the then Institute of Maritime Law at the University of Natal, which was pioneered under the headship of Professor Hilton Staniland, was one of the first Maritime law programmes of its kind in South Africa. The above institute was well known in South African Maritime circles. A number of South African statutes regulating the South African maritime industry were drafted by Professor Hilton Staniland at the above Institute, including the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1 of 1986 and the Wreck and Salvage Act 94 of 1996. The Memorial Tower Building on the Howard College Campus of the University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban The main science block on the Howard College campus, completed in the early 1980s, was a pivotal location for biological research and game conservation for the province. The Howard College campus in Durban was strung out along the Berea, a ridge to the north of the Durban city centre. Under apartheid, the Howard College Campus, in Durban, was known for the activism of its staff and students against government-imposed racial segregation. Particularly in the 1960s Natal University students were active in the non-racial National Union of South African Students, which was one of the main organizations opposing the apartheid system. In the 1970s and 1980s many of its students were members of the often-banned South African Students' Organisation (SASO), centred on the main arts centre at the Howard College campus. In addition, the university magazine Dome (named for the dome of the Howard College Building), was active against apartheid and was often banned, with the printing press being moved around to prevent its being confiscated by police. The Howard College campus had a number of onsite residences, named after prominent South Africans including John Bews, Ernest Jansen, Louis Botha and Mabel Palmer. The Pietermartizburg campus was the original campus, though it later became the smaller of the two main campuses. The campus is in a suburban location, centred on the library and administration buildings. The library houses many historic books, including books on colonial history and Boer war history. Unlike the Durban campus, most students did not live in campus residences. On 1 January 2004, the University of Natal was merged with the University of Durban-Westville to create a new legal entity called the University of KwaZulu-Natal.

In other words, it is the curve traced out by a point fixed to a circle (where the point may be on, inside, or outside the circle) as it rolls along a straight line.

General description A more general approach would define a trochoid as the locus of a point (x,y) orbiting at a constant rate around an axis located at (x',y'), :x=x'+r_1\\\\cos(\\\\omega_1 t+\\\\phi_1),\\\\ y=y'+r_1\\\\sin(\\\\omega_1 t+\\\\phi_1),\\\\ r_1>0, which axis is being translated in the x-y-plane at a constant rate in either a straight line, :\\\\begin{array}{lcl} x'=x_0+v_{2x} t,\\\\ y'=y_0+v_{2y} t \\\\therefore x = x_0+r_1\\\\cos(\\\\omega_1 t+\\\\phi_1)+v_{2x} t,\\\\ y = y_0+r_1 \\\\sin(\\\\omega_1 t+\\\\phi_1)+v_{2y} t, \\\\end{array} or a circular path (another orbit) around (x_0,y_0) (the hypotrochoid/epitrochoid case), :\\\\begin{array}{lcl} x' = x_0+r_2\\\\cos(\\\\omega_2 t+\\\\phi_2),\\\\ y' = y_0+r_2\\\\sin(\\\\omega_2 t+\\\\phi_2),\\\\ r_2\\\\ge 0 \\\\therefore x = x_0+r_1\\\\cos(\\\\omega_1 t+\\\\phi_1)+r_2\\\\cos(\\\\omega_2 t+\\\\phi_2),\\\\ y = y_0+r_1 \\\\sin(\\\\omega_1 t+\\\\phi_1)+r_2\\\\sin(\\\\omega_2 t+\\\\phi_2), \\\\end{array} The ratio of the rates of motion and whether the moving axis translates in a straight or circular path determines the shape of the trochoid. In the case of a straight path, one full rotation coincides with one period of a periodic (repeating) locus. In the case of a circular path for the moving axis, the locus is periodic only if the ratio of these angular motions, \\\\omega_1/\\\\omega_2, is a rational number, say p/q, where p & q are coprime, in which case, one period consists of p orbits around the moving axis and q orbits of the moving axis around the point (x_0,y_0). The special cases of the epicycloid and hypocycloid, generated by tracing the locus of a point on the perimeter of a circle of radius r_1 while it is rolled on the perimeter of a stationary circle of radius R, have the following properties: :\\\\begin{array}{lcl} \\\\text{epicycloid: }&\\\\omega_1/\\\\omega_2&=p/q=r_2/r_1=R/r_1+1,\\\\ p-q \\\\text{ cusps} \\\\text{hypocycloid: }&\\\\omega_1/\\\\omega_2&=p/q=-r_2/r_1=-(R/r_1-1),\\\\ p-q=p+q \\\\text{ cusps} \\\\end{array} where r_2 is the radius of the orbit of the moving axis. The number of cusps given above also hold true for any epitrochoid and hypotrochoid, with \\"cusps\\" replaced by either \\"radial maxima\\" or \\"radial minima\\".

Huron was incorporated on 5 May 1863 and is the founding institution of the University of Western Ontario. It was established in 1863 by two Anglican clergyman and is the oldest affiliated institution of the University of Western Ontario. Huron is also home to an Anglican seminary. Huron predates the establishment of the University of Western Ontario by 15 years and acted as a founding element of the larger university. In the latter half of the 20th century, Huron evolved from its theological roots into a modern liberal arts college. History Benjamin Cronyn Isaac Hellmuth Huron was founded on 5 May 1863 by Benjamin Cronyn (first Bishop of Huron) and Isaac Hellmuth (Archdeacon of Huron), as an evangelical low-church alternative to the high-church Trinity University in Toronto. The first class of 13 students was taught by Isaac Hellmuth (Huron's first principal) in the winter of 1863. The evangelical section of the Church of England obtained a charter for Huron, under the name of the Western University of London in 1878. It has been a University of Western Ontario founding institution since 1878 (the oldest affiliated institution of the University of Western Ontario). William A. Joanes (architect) designed an addition to Huron College's original property in 1891.http://dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/architects/view/160William A. Joanes (architect) Over one-fifth of Canadian Anglican chaplains who served in the First and Second World Wars were trained at Huron.http://www.christophermccreery.com/Heritage_Projects/Heritage_Projects/huron.html Heritage Projects A plaque was unveiled on 11 November 1997 to commemorate the lives of 18 Huron graduates who died in the First and Second World Wars. Its original property, known as Rough Park, occupied the block bounded by Grosvenor, St. George and St. James Streets. In 1951, Huron moved to its present location and has since seen a growth in not only student enrollment, but also in its residence facilities, classrooms, library, and faculty offices. Huron's faculty of Arts and Social Science has been in partnership with the University of Western Ontario since 1956.

The act provides for an Executive Board composed of The Bishop of Huron, the Coadjutor and Suffragan Bishop or Bishops of Huron, the Principal of Huron, the President of the Huron's Students' Council, the Deans of Huron, the President of the Alumni Association, a full-time student from each of the Faculty of Theology and Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, and up to 12 additional members. The Act also provides for an Academic Council to oversee issues relating to the academic life of Huron College. As an affiliate of the University of Western Ontario, Huron is also subject to an Affiliation Agreement which outlines the relationship between both universities. Under this agreement, the University grants degrees on behalf of Huron College and has authority to set common academic and admission standards in consultation with Huron and the other affiliate colleges: Brescia College and King's College. Huron retains the right to grant Honorary Doctor of Divinity degrees. The strategic plan for 2005‚Äì2010 aims to \\"nurture a sense of community respectful of individual differences and responsive to individual needs; to support an active student life which encourages the personal and intellectual growth of its members; and, through its chapel and theological programs, to affirm its heritage as an Anglican university.\\" =School structure= The majority of students are enrolled in the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences which offers over 60 undergraduate programs of study. The remainder of students are enrolled in undergraduate and graduate programs through the Faculty of Theology. =Campus property= Rough Park, its original property, occupied the block bounded by Grosvenor, St. George and St. James Streets in London Ontario. In 1951, Huron moved to its present location steps from the University of Western Ontario. Huron is located on the western side of Western Road, across from the centre of the University of Western Ontario Main Campus. The University Community Centre (UCC) and the Weldon Library are also nearby. The Administrative Wing includes the Silcox Memorial Library, the Great Hall and the Chapel of St. John the Evangelist. The Valley Wing includes Jago Courtyard and classrooms. The Huron dining hall is steps from the Western campus. Classroom W12, one of Huron's largest classrooms which holds 120 seats is used for many first-year courses and larger lectures. The Kingsmill Room in Huron's main building is used for larger events such as convocations and guest lectures. ;Chapel Huron is also home to the collegiate-style Chapel of St. John the Evangelist which was built in the 1950s to replace the original chapel. The chapel has a seating capacity of 160 and includes a Casavant organ. There are also a number of Orthodox icons including a 19th-century hand-painted Russian icon of the Holy Trinity. The chapel is open to students of all denominations. ;Silcox Memorial Library The Huron University College Library is located on the main floor of the administration wing of the Huron campus. The library houses a 165,000 volume collection in the humanities and social sciences as well as The Kimel Family Information Commons, with 20 PC workstations and wireless access. Comfortable reading alcoves and private group study rooms are available in addition to personal study carrels. All registered students, faculty and staff at Huron and Western, as well as qualified guest borrowers, may borrow from Huron Library. Campus lifeResidence= Huron has three residence halls. Hellmuth Hall is a co-ed residence and houses approximately 98 first-year Huron students. O'Neil/Ridley Hall is a co-ed dormitory housing 185 Huron first-year students. Southwest Residence is a suite-style residence building that houses approximately 56 first-year students. Huron also has two houses on campus, Brough House and Henderson House, that serve as both first-year and upper-year student housing. = Huron University College Students' Council = The Huron University College Students‚Äô Council (HUCSC) is a student government organization and not-for-profit corporation at Huron, committed to enhancing the educational experience and quality of life for all undergraduate students at Huron University College. The HUCSC works toward this mission in three main ways: \\\\- Amplifying the collective student voice through advocacy on student issues, concerns, and priorities to Huron administration, faculty, and other community stakeholders. \\\\- Providing programming to students in the form of social and academic events, as well as services like the HUCSC Clubs System, Intramurals, and the campus bar, the Beaver Dam. \\\\- Creating opportunities for meaningful involvement in the Huron community, service-learning, and leadership- development for students. There are typically 70+ members and positions on the HUCSC ranging from Executive positions, elected Councillors and Representatives, hired bartenders, Commissioners, Coordinators, and Associate Vice-Presidents. The HUCSC consists of 6 portfolios: The President‚Äôs Portfolio, the Student Affairs Portfolio, the Student Events Portfolio, the Finance and Administration Portfolio, the Communications Portfolio, and the Governance Portfolio.

It is the intersection of a sphere with a cylinder that is tangent to the sphere and passes through the center of the sphere (see diagram). Before Viviani this curve was studied by Simon de La Loub√®re and Gilles de Roberval.Kuno Fladt: Analytische Geometrie spezieller Fl√§chen und Raumkurven. Springer-Verlag, 2013, , 9783322853653, p. 97.K. Strubecker: Vorlesungen der Darstellenden Geometrie. Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, G√∂ttingen 1967, p. 250. The projection of Viviani's curve onto a plane perpendicular to the line through the crossing point and the sphere center is the lemniscate of Gerono.. In 1692 Viviani tackled the task: Cut out of a half sphere (radius r) two windows, such that the remaining surface (of the half sphere) can be squared, i.e. a square with the same area can be constructed using only compasses and ruler. His solution has an area of 4r^2 (see below).  Equations  cylinder upright. In order to keep the proof for squaring simple, : the sphere has the equation \\\\; x^2+y^2+z^2=r^2\\\\; and : the cylinder is upright with equation \\\\; x^2+y^2-rx=0\\\\;. The cylinder has radius r/2 and is tangent to the sphere at point (r,0,0)\\\\ .  Properties of the curve  Floor plan, elevation and side plan = Floor plan, elevation and side plan Elimination of x , y , z respectively yields: The orthogonal projection of the intersection curve onto the : x-y-plane is the circle with equation \\\\; (x-\\\\tfrac{r}{2})^2+y^2=(\\\\tfrac{r}{2})^2\\\\ . : x-z-plane the parabola with equation \\\\; x=-\\\\tfrac{1}{r}z^2+r \\\\; . : y-z-plane the algebraic curve with the equation \\\\; z^4+r^2(y^2-z^2)=0 \\\\; . = Parametric representation = For parametric representation and the determination of the area Representing the sphere by : \\\\begin{array}{cll} x &=& r \\\\cdot \\\\cos \\\\theta \\\\cdot \\\\cos \\\\varphi  y &=& r \\\\cdot \\\\cos \\\\theta \\\\cdot \\\\sin \\\\varphi  z &=& r \\\\cdot \\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\qquad \\\\qquad -\\\\tfrac{\\\\pi}{2}\\\\le\\\\theta\\\\le\\\\tfrac{\\\\pi}{2}\\\\ , \\\\ -\\\\pi\\\\le\\\\varphi\\\\le \\\\pi \\\\; , \\\\end{array} and setting \\\\; \\\\varphi=\\\\theta, \\\\; yields the curve *: \\\\begin{array}{cll} x &=& r \\\\cdot \\\\cos \\\\theta \\\\cdot \\\\cos \\\\theta  y &=& r \\\\cdot \\\\cos \\\\theta \\\\cdot \\\\sin \\\\theta  z &=& r \\\\cdot \\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\qquad \\\\qquad -\\\\tfrac{\\\\pi}{2}\\\\le\\\\theta\\\\le\\\\tfrac{\\\\pi}{2}\\\\ . \\\\end{array} One easily checks, that the spherical curve fulfills the equation of the cylinder. But the boundaries allow only the red part (see diagram) of Viviani's curve. The missing second half (green) has the property \\\\; \\\\color{green}\\\\varphi=-\\\\theta \\\\; . With help of this parametric representation it is easy to proof the statement: The area of the half sphere (containing Viviani's curve) minus the area of the two windows is 4r^2: = Rational bezier representation = The quarter of Viviani's curve that lies in the all-positive quadrant of 3D space cannot be represented exactly by a regular bezier curve of any degree. However, it can be represented exactly by a 3D rational bezier segment of degree 4, and there is an infinite family of rational bezier control points generating that segment. One possible solution is given by the following five control points: : \\\\boldsymbol{p0} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0  0  1  1 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\boldsymbol{p1} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0  \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\sqrt{2}}  \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}  \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\boldsymbol{p2} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\frac{1}{3}  \\\\frac{1}{2}  \\\\frac{1}{2}  \\\\frac{2}{3} \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\boldsymbol{p3} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}  \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\sqrt{2}}  \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\sqrt{2}}  \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\boldsymbol{p4} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1  0  0  1 \\\\end{bmatrix} The corresponding rational parametrization is: : \\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{c} \\\\frac{2 \\\\mu ^2 \\\\left(\\\\mu ^2-2 \\\\left(2+\\\\sqrt{2}\\\\right) \\\\mu +4 \\\\sqrt{2}+6\\\\right)}{\\\\left(2 (\\\\mu -1) \\\\mu +\\\\sqrt{2}+2\\\\right)^2}  \\\\frac{2 (\\\\mu -1) \\\\mu \\\\left((\\\\mu -1) \\\\mu -3 \\\\sqrt{2}-4\\\\right)}{\\\\left(2 (\\\\mu -1) \\\\mu +\\\\sqrt{2}+2\\\\right)^2}  -\\\\frac{(\\\\mu -1) \\\\left(\\\\sqrt{2} \\\\mu +\\\\sqrt{2}+2\\\\right)}{2 (\\\\mu -1) \\\\mu +\\\\sqrt{2}+2}  \\\\end{array} \\\\right) \\\\; \\\\mu\\\\in\\\\left[0,1\\\\right] = Squaring = The area of the upper right part of Viviani's window (see diagram) can be calculated by an integration: :\\\\iint_{S_{sphere}} r^2 \\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\theta \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\varphi =r^2 \\\\int_0^{\\\\pi/2} \\\\int_0^\\\\theta \\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\varphi \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\theta= r^2(\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}-1)\\\\ . Hence the total area of the spherical surface included by Viviani's curve is 2\\\\pi r^2-4r^2 and * the area of the half sphere (2\\\\pi r^2) minus the area of Viviani's window is \\\\; 4r^2\\\\;, the area of a square with the sphere's diameter as the length of an edge.  Relation to other curves  * The 8-shaped elevation (see above) is a Lemniscate of Gerono. * Viviani' curve is a special Clelia curve. For a Clelia curve the relation between the angles is \\\\; \\\\varphi=c\\\\;\\\\theta \\\\;. Viviani's curve (red) as intersection of the sphere and a cone (pink) Subtracting 2√ó the cylinder equation from the sphere's equation and applying completing the square leads to the equation :(x-r)^2+y^2=z^2\\\\; , which describes a right circular cone with its apex at \\\\;(r,0,0)\\\\;, the double point of Viviani's curve. Hence * Viviani's curve can be considered not only as the intersection curve of a sphere and a cylinder but also as :a) the intersection of a sphere and a cone and as :b) the intersection of a cylinder and a cone.

It is generated by two circles of radius b with centers distance 2a apart (taken to be at (¬±a, 0). A line segment of length 2c attaches to a point on each of the circles, and the midpoint of the line segment traces out the Watt curve as the circles rotate partially back and forth or completely around.

Any side must be less than the sum of the remaining sides, so the curve is empty (at least in the real plane) unless a2+b2 2 then the curve has the form of a figure eight. If d is 0 then the curve is a figure eight with two branches of the curve having a common horizontal tangent at the origin. If 0b then the points ¬±d are still solutions to the Cartesian equation of the curve, but the curve does not cross these points and they are acnodes. The curve again has a figure eight shape though the shape is distorted if d is close to b. Given b>a+c, the shape of the curve is determined by the relative sizes of a and c. If ac then the curve does not cross the x-axis at all and consists of two flattened ovals.Encyclop√©die des Formes Math√©matiques Remarquables page for section. Watt's linkage thumb When the curve crosses the origin, the origin is a point of inflection and therefore has contact of order 3 with a tangent. However, if a2=b2+2 then tangent has contact of order 5 with the tangent, in other words the curve is a close approximation of a straight line. This is the basis for Watt's linkage.

It can be defined as locus of the point of intersection of two lines, each rotating at a uniform rate about separate points, so that the ratio of the rates of rotation is 1:3 and the lines initially coincide with the line between the two points. A generalization of this construction is called a sectrix of Maclaurin. The curve is named after Colin Maclaurin who investigated the curve in 1742. Equations Let two lines rotate about the points P = (0,0) and P_1 = (a, 0) so that when the line rotating about P has angle \\\\theta with the x axis, the rotating about P_1 has angle 3\\\\theta. Let Q be the point of intersection, then the angle formed by the lines at Q is 2\\\\theta. By the law of sines, :{r \\\\over \\\\sin 3\\\\theta} = {a \\\\over \\\\sin 2\\\\theta}\\\\\\\\! so the equation in polar coordinates is (up to translation and rotation) :r= a \\\\frac{\\\\sin 3\\\\theta}{\\\\sin 2\\\\theta} = {a \\\\over 2} \\\\frac{4 \\\\cos^2 \\\\theta - 1} {\\\\cos \\\\theta} = {a \\\\over 2} (4 \\\\cos \\\\theta - \\\\sec \\\\theta)\\\\\\\\!. The curve is therefore a member of the Conchoid of de Sluze family. In Cartesian coordinates the equation of this curve is :2x(x^2+y^2)=a(3x^2-y^2)\\\\\\\\!. If the origin is moved to (a, 0) then a derivation similar to that given above shows that the equation of the curve in polar coordinates becomes :r = \\\\frac{a}{2 \\\\cos{\\\\theta \\\\over 3}}\\\\\\\\! making it an example of an epispiral. The trisection property The Trisectrix of Maclaurin showing the angle trisection property Given an angle \\\\phi, draw a ray from (a, 0) whose angle with the x-axis is \\\\phi. Draw a ray from the origin to the point where the first ray intersects the curve. Then, by the construction of the curve, the angle between the second ray and the x-axis is \\\\phi/ 3 Notable points and features The curve has an x-intercept at 3a \\\\over 2 and a double point at the origin. The vertical line x={-{a \\\\over 2}} is an asymptote. The curve intersects the line x = a, or the point corresponding to the trisection of a right angle, at (a,{\\\\pm {1 \\\\over \\\\sqrt{3}} a}). As a nodal cubic, it is of genus zero. Relationship to other curves The trisectrix of Maclaurin can be defined from conic sections in three ways. Specifically: * It is the inverse with respect to the unit circle of the hyperbola ::2x=a(3x^2-y^2). * It is cissoid of the circle ::(x+a)^2+y^2 = a^2 :and the line x={a \\\\over 2} relative to the origin. * It is the pedal with respect to the origin of the parabola ::y^2=2a(x-\\\\tfrac{3}{2}a). In addition: * The inverse with respect to the point (a, 0) is the Lima√ßon trisectrix. * The trisectrix of Maclaurin is related to the Folium of Descartes by affine transformation.

It does this by changing the administration paradigm to make all of the slave node file systems manageable from one point, and automate the distribution of the node file system during node boot. It allows a central administration model for all slave nodes and includes the tools needed to build configuration files, monitor, and control the nodes. It is totally customizable and can be adapted to just about any type of cluster. From the software administration perspective it does not make much difference if you are running 2 nodes or 500 nodes. The procedure is still the same, which is why Warewulf is scalable from the admins perspective. Also, because it uses a standard chroot'able file system for every node, it is extremely configurable and lends itself to custom environments very easily. While Warewulf was designed to be a HPC system, it is not an HPC system in itself. Warewulf is more along the lines of a distributed Linux distribution, or more specifically a system for replicating and managing small, lightweight Linux systems from one master. Using Warewulf, HPC packages such as LAM/MPI/MPICH, Sun Grid Engine, PVM, etc. can be easily deployed throughout the cluster. Warewulf solves the problem of slave node management rather than being a strict HPC specific system (even though it was designed with HPC in mind). Because of this it is as flexible as a home grown cluster, but administratively scales very well. As a result of this flexibility and ease of customization, Warewulf has been used not only on production HPC implementations, but also development systems like KASY0 (the first system to break the one hundred dollar per GFLOPS barrier), and non HPC systems such as web server cluster farms, intrusion detection clusters, and high-availability clusters.

This included a greatly increased set of objects, including support for the Communications ToolBox and an associated Terminal object. This release also included a suite of multimedia objects that allowed for the creation of interactive kiosk apps and similar. A 2.1 release followed in October, and an enormous performance upgrade in 2.2 in October 1991.

In January 1992 3.0 was release, including significant changes. The largest change followed in November 1992, however, with the introduction of Windows support and a renaming to Serius Workshop and Serius Developer Pro (mapping to Programmer and Developer from previous versions). =AppWare= Novell had invested in Serius on a number of occasions. In June 1993, during Ray Noorda's period of intense empire building, Novell purchased Serius outright. The company also purchased Software Transformations Inc., who made a cross- platform object code library that could be used to port conventional programs to a number of platforms, including the Mac, Windows, SunOS, UnixWare, HP-UX, with plans to add many more. Together, Serius and Software Transformations were bundled under the new name AppWare, although they were unrelated products. Immediately after the acquisitions, AppWare was positioned as one of the \\"three pillars\\" of Novell's long-term strategy, the others being NetWare and UnixWare. The plan, according to statements from Novell, was to make it easier for 3rd party developers to write network-aware programs. Under the new AppWare branding, Serius became the AppWare Visual AppBuilder, or VAB for short. The name of the internal Objects also changed, becoming \\"AppWare Loadable Modules\\" (ALMs), in keeping with the naming for their NetWare Loadable Modules (NLMs) under their core Novell NetWare product. The newly renamed version was released as a 1.0 version in October 1993. Software Transformations' code base became the AppWare Foundation. It was not long before the AppWare plans started to fall apart. By early 1994, Novell's support for AppWare Foundation was waning, and in September 1994 they announced they would be selling the product to a third party. They did state that development of Visual AppBuilder would continue, and a Unix port would be following. They also continued to release a number of new ALMs.Scott Mace, \\"AppWare strategy in disarray\\", InfoWorld, 5 September 1994, pp. 5 The Unix versions never appeared, instead, the Mac and Windows versions were renamed AppWare, and updated in a 1.1 release in 1994. =MicroBrew= Noorda was forced from Novell in April 1994, and many of the companies and products he had purchased were subsequently sold off. Joe Firmage became disillusioned with Novell in mid-1995, following its decision to sell UnixWare and abandon the \\"SuperNOS\\" project that would have combined UnixWare and Netware, and left Novell later that year. Novell then publicly stated in November 1995 that it was looking for a buyer for AppWare.Krill, Paul. \\"Will AppWare be next to go?\\" InfoWorld, November 6, 1995, 24.

In March 1996, it was announced (based on an agreement that had been signed the month before) that Novell had sold all rights to the AppWare technology to a new company called Network Multimedia Inc. (NMI), which was headed by Ed Firmage, who had been director of AppWare marketing at Novell.\\"Novell Inc.

Users of the system attempted to negotiate a release of the source code into some sort of open source license in early 2000, and started The Serious Project on SourceForge to coordinate development. However this release does not appear to have taken place, the page has no code.\\"The Serious Project\\", SourceForce, 10 June 2000 Description Applications in AppWare were constructed by dropping icons representing pre-rolled objects onto a worksheet, and then connecting them together to represent message flows between them. Communications was mediated by a protocol known as the Object Interaction Protocol. Some of the \\"objects\\" represented basic logic statements, while others represented GUI widgets such as text editors. The overall logic for any particular object, say a text editor in a window, was constructed as a series of chains of these object connections, fired up in response to an event. At a high level the system is similar in concept to HyperCard or Visual BASIC, in that the program's logic is strongly associated with the object that sends some initial event. AppWare built true \\"double clickable\\" applications that ran natively on either Windows or the Mac. Unlike most systems of the sort, like HyperCard, the applications did not end up looking generic, and generally behaved as first-class citizens of the host system. However the applications were also similar to HyperCard in that they generally did not support multi-window operation or the creation of new documents. AppWare applications consisted of a fixed number of forms and windows, a side effect of its lack of a \`NEW\`-type operator for creating new objects at runtime.

It serves, via a bus link, Liverpool John Lennon Airport in the neighbouring suburb of Speke, as well as providing an interchange between main line services and the Merseyrail rapid transit/commuter rail network. The station is located towards the southern end of Merseyrail's Northern Line and on the junction of two main lines: the City Line from Liverpool to Manchester via Warrington and the Liverpool branch of the West Coast Main Line to London via . Allerton Traction Maintenance Depot is situated to the immediate east of the station. History The entrance to Liverpool South Parkway Exterior shot of Liverpool South Parkway during construction The station was built at a crossing point between two railway lines that had until then been served by separate stations. The first was the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC) line from Liverpool Central to Manchester via Warrington Central, which ran from west to east. The second was the line built by the St Helens Railway from Liverpool Lime Street to Warrington Bank Quay, which crossed from northwest to southeast. The latter route became part of the Liverpool branch of the West Coast Main Line when it was connected to a new route from Crewe via the newly built Runcorn Railway Bridge. The original line to Warrington Bank Quay is now closed to passenger trains. The two lines were served by two separate stations in the area, respectively Garston and Allerton (though the latter was also located in Garston). The first proposals for an interchange station at Garston were made in the 1960s and 1970s, when the Merseyrail semi-underground network was being planned. At the time, the suggestion was that the new station and Broad Green would be interchanges between long-distance trains and trains on an outer orbital line (the North Liverpool Extension Line). However, the latter line closed in 1972. The line from Liverpool Central to Garston was also closed in 1972, with trains on the CLC route being diverted to Liverpool Lime Street. The route from Liverpool Central to Garston was reopened in 1978 as part of the Merseyrail Northern Line. After 1983, this route was extended to Hunts Cross, the next station to the east. As the orbital route had been closed, the impetus to eventually complete the station was to improve public transport access to the expanding Liverpool John Lennon Airport, and also to provide new journey opportunities for rail passengers in south Liverpool by giving easy interchange between Northern Line, City Line and West Coast Main Line services. Construction began in 2004. Allerton station closed in July 2005 and the new station was built on its site. The concourse, bus station and car park were built on land that was once the home of South Liverpool F.C. An information board situated on the footpath towards the main road explains the history of the site. The station opened on 11 June 2006, the day after Garston station closed. At the time of opening, the Merseyrail City Line service (which had been hourly at the former Allerton station) was increased to half-hourly. The station also became an additional stop on the Liverpool-Birmingham service (then operated by Central Trains). From 11 December 2006, the Monday-Saturday evening service on the Northern Line was increased to run every 15 minutes, instead of half-hourly as previously. Initially, many long-distance services omitted Liverpool South Parkway from their timetables, however more train services were gradually introduced. In December 2008 the Birmingham service was doubled in frequency, and East Midlands Trains services began calling at the station. In December 2010 a further service was introduced, when First TransPennine Express services added the station as an extra stop on their services from Liverpool to and Scarborough. In May 2011, Blackpool North services which operated from Lime Street were extended to start and terminate at Liverpool South Parkway. The service is operated by Northern Trains and does not call at stations between South Parkway and Lime Street. The service from Lime Street is unchanged. Trains travelling from Blackpool North to Liverpool South Parkway have a 15-minute dwelling time at Liverpool Lime Street. In early 2017 Liverpool South Parkway served as a temporary hub for national trains whilst Lime Street was closed due to a landslide. In September of the year, platform 4 was temporarily extended by 150 metres to allow intercity services to serve the station whilst Lime Street station is shut due to refurbishment work. In mid 2018 the station again acted as a hub whilst Lime Street was upgraded.Liverpool Lime Street reopens after eight-week closure =Criticism= Originally scheduled to open in December 2005, the project fell behind schedule, and finally opened on 11 June 2006. The construction cost, originally estimated to be ¬£16 million, had doubled to ¬£32 million by the time construction was completed. Merseytravel rejected criticism of the delays and cost increase, stating that it had been caused by factors beyond its control, such as the collapse of Railtrack, increasing steel costs and poor weather causing flooding at the construction site. Tom Wileman, regional director of bus operator Stagecoach, described Liverpool South Parkway as a \\"white elephant\\". However, from 28 September 2008 Stagecoach service 82 was rerouted to serve the station; and from December 2008, trains operated by Stagecoach-owned East Midlands Trains began calling. Facilities The station has six platforms (four high-level platforms on the West Coast Main Line and a further two on the Northern Line), a bus station for local bus services, taxi rank, car park, bicycle storage, caf√© and passenger lounge. The station has been designed to use environmentally friendly techniques wherever possible. Some of the building's electricity is provided by photovoltaic cells. A 700,000 litre rainwater harvesting system has also been installed to reduce the use of mains water. This water will be used for cleaning and washing, as well as toilet flushes. All timber used has been certified by the Forest Stewardship Council as being from a well-managed forest. The roof is made from recycled aluminium instead of virgin materials. The automatic doors at each of the five bus stances open only when a bus arrives, enhancing safety but also retaining heat within the building and avoiding excessive openings of the doors. The free-access main entrance uses a revolving door to avoid draughts. In August 2006, Liverpool South Parkway won the Innovation Award at Network Rail's annual Environment Awards. In June 2009 the station underwent some enhancements, and saw the introduction of a new travel centre and a heated passenger lounge with wifi internet access, comfortable chairs and free newspapers, adjacent to the caf√©; ticket barriers at both ends of the concourse were also installed. A ticket vending machine, allowing collection of tickets booked online, was installed in July 2014. In November 2016, an MtoGo shop was opened, selling a range of snacks and drinks alongside tickets. This replaced the former travel centre, which was converted into a Costa Coffee outlet in the summer of 2017.

Transport for Wales Transport for Wales services between Liverpool Lime Street and Chester serve the station hourly, with a single early evening service extended to Wrexham General. Avanti West Coast Avanti West Coast services do not normally serve the station. The platforms are not long enough to accommodate a 9 or 11 coach Pendolino train. However, platform 4 was temporarily extended in 2017 to permit Virgin services to use the station while Lime Street was closed for major engineering works in Autumn 2017 and Summer 2018. Bus Services Bus services run from the station to Liverpool John Lennon Airport, Aigburth, Dingle, Mossley Hill, Penny Lane, Liverpool City Centre, Belle Vale, Widnes and Runcorn. Services are operated by Arriva North West, Stagecoach Merseyside & South Lancashire and HTL Buses. Passengers can use local services 80A and 86A for transfer to/from the airport. The Arriva AirLink 500 express service also calls here. Combined bus- rail tickets are available for rail passengers wishing to travel to the airport. Former services From 23 May 2011, Northern Rail introduced direct services to Blackpool North. This was achieved by extending the existing Blackpool to Liverpool service. Trains ran non-stop from Liverpool South Parkway to Liverpool Lime Street, where they reversed to continue their journey to Blackpool. Seven trains operated Monday-Saturday, all outside the peaks with no direct evening or Sunday service.GB National Railway Timetable 2013-14, Tables 90 & 91 This service ceased to serve South Parkway in May 2018, reverting to operate between Liverpool Lime Street and Blackpool North only. TransPennine Express trains served the station with an hourly service to Scarborough from December 2010. This ended in May 2018 when TransPennine services were rerouted to use the Chat Moss route between Liverpool and Manchester via Newton-le-Willows. A shuttle bus formerly provided a link to the National Trust's property at Speke Hall, running weekends and bank holidays between April and September. Future Merseytravel have stated that they aim to work with the train operators to improve the train service at Liverpool South Parkway, introducing new services with each twice-yearly timetable change. Other new services which have been proposed but not confirmed are: * Additional shuttle services between Liverpool South Parkway and Liverpool Lime Street on the City Line * More frequent Sunday services on the Northern Line * Merseytravel have repeatedly asked for a Virgin service from Liverpool South Parkway. Proposals for High Speed 2 raise the possibility of London trains calling at Liverpool South Parkway. This could be as part of the new high speed service to Liverpool or as part of a revised stopping pattern on the existing West Coast Main Line service. =Airport tram-train proposal= In August 2009, it was reported that a new tram-train link to Liverpool John Lennon Airport and a link to Kings Dock from the east of the city had been proposed. At Liverpool South Parkway, the tram-train would leave the existing railway line and seamlessly transfer to a new tramway. This project was referenced again in November 2016 in Merseytravel's Rail Development and Delivery presentation as a \\"top rail project\\". During the presentation, Merseytravel's Senior Head of Service Operations revealed that there were no immediate plans to develop the rail link and its feasibility depended on the airport's passenger numbers increasing. Accidents and incidents On 6 October 2017 a train derailed near the station. The incident occurred at low speed while not in passenger service. There were no injuries.

It is located on the European shore of the Bosporus, between Be≈üikta≈ü and Ortak√∂y in Istanbul, Turkey. The Sultan‚Äôs Suite, billed at per night, is ranked number 14 on World's 15 most expensive hotel suites compiled by CNN Go in 2012.Arnold, Helen CNN Go. 25 March 2012. Retrieved 2014-10-09  History  The palace, built by Sultan Abdulaziz, was designed by the Armenian palace architect Nigoƒüayos Balyan and constructed by his sons Sarkis and Hagop Balyan between 1863 and 1867, during a period in which all Ottoman sultans built their own palaces rather than using those of their ancestors; √áƒ±raƒüan Palace is the last example of this tradition. The inner walls and the roof were made of wood, the outer walls of colorful marble. A beautiful marble bridge connects the palace to the Yƒ±ldƒ±z Palace on the hill behind. A very high garden wall protects the palace from the outer world. The construction and the interior decoration of the palace continued until 1872. Sultan Abdulaziz did not live long in his magnificent palace - he was found dead inside on 30 May 1876, shortly after he was dethroned. His successor, his nephew Sultan Murad V, moved into √áƒ±raƒüan Palace, but reigned for only 93 days. He was deposed by his brother Abdul Hamid II due to alleged mental illness and lived there under house arrest until his death on 29 August 1904 On November 14, 1909, during the Second Constitutional Monarchy, Sultan Mehmed V allowed the Ottoman Parliament to hold their meetings in this building. Only two months later, on January 19, 1910, a great fire destroyed the palace, leaving only the outer walls intact. Called \\"≈ûeref Stadƒ±\\", for many years its garden served as a football field for the club Be≈üikta≈ü J.K.. In 1987, the ruined palace was bought by a Japanese corporation, which restored the palace and added a modern hotel complex next to it in its garden. The modern hotel building was opened in 1990 and the restored palace building was opened in 1992. Today, it serves as luxury suites for the five-star Kempinski hotel along with two restaurants that cater to guests. The Palace was renovated again during the first quarter of 2007, now resembling the authentic palace with the baroque style and soft colors.

If the multipath time delay spread equals D seconds, then the coherence bandwidth W_c in rad/s is given approximately by the equation: :W_c \\\\approx {2 \\\\pi \\\\over \\\\ D} Also coherence bandwidth B_c in Hz is given approximately by the equation: :B_c \\\\approx {1 \\\\over \\\\ D} It can be reasonably assumed that the channel is flat if the coherence bandwidth is greater than the data signal bandwidth. The coherence bandwidth varies over cellular or PCS communications paths because the multipath spread D varies from path to path. Application Frequencies within a coherence bandwidth of one another tend to all fade in a similar or correlated fashion. One reason for designing the CDMA IS-95 waveform with a bandwidth of approximately 1.25 MHz is because in many urban signaling environments the coherence bandwidth Bc is significantly less than 1.25 MHz. Therefore, when fading occurs it occurs only over a relatively small fraction of the total CDMA signal bandwidth. The portion of the signal bandwidth over which fading does not occur typically contains enough signal power to sustain reliable communications. This is the bandwidth over which the channel transfer function remains virtually constant.  Example  If the delay spread D over a particular cellular communication path in an urban environment is 1.9 ¬µs, then using equation above, the coherence bandwidth is approximately 0.53 MHz, which results in frequency selective fading over the IS-95 bandwidth.

Originally published in the Irish Homestead on 13 August 1904, \\"The Sisters\\" was Joyce's first published work of fiction. Joyce later revised the story and had it, along with the rest of the series, published in book form in 1914. Major characters *The boy (narrator) *James Flynn, former priest *Eliza Flynn, sister of James Flynn *Nannie Flynn, sister of James Flynn *Old Cotter *Aunt of the boy *Uncle of the boy Summary ‚Ä≥The Sisters‚Ä≥ gives a portrait of the relationship between a nameless boy and the infirm priest Father Flynn. The priest who has been relieved of his priestly duties has acted as a mentor for the boy in the clerical duties of a Catholic priest. The story starts with the boy contemplating Father Flynn's illness and impending death. He is fascinated with interpreting signs and symbols, and their meaning. Later, while the boy eats his dinner, his aunt, uncle, and old Cotter have a conversation in which the boy is informed that the priest has died. The conversation focuses on the priest and his relationship with the boy. That night the boy is haunted by images of the priest. The next day the boy goes to look at the announcement that the priest has died, and then wanders about, further puzzling about his dream and about his relationship with the priest. That night the boy and his aunt go to the house of mourning. They view the corpse with Nannie, and then they sit with the sisters Eliza and Nannie. They are offered food and drink, and then Eliza and the aunt carry on a conversation that reveals that Father Flynn had apparently suffered a mental breakdown after accidentally breaking a chalice. The dialogue then trails off. Evolution of the story In summer of 1904, George Russell of the editorial department of the weekly paper The Irish Homestead wrote Joyce a letter in regards to a section of the journal called \\"Our Weekly Story\\": > Dear Joyce, Look at the story in this paper The Irish Homestead. Could you > write anything simple, rural?, livemaking?, pathos?, which could be inserted > so as not to shock the readers. If you could furnish a short story about > 1800 words suitable for insertion the editor will pay ¬£1. It is easily > earned money if you can write fluently and don't mind playing to the common > understanding and liking for once in a way. You can sign it any name you > like as a pseudonym. Yours sincerely > > Geo. W. Russell (Letters 43)James Joyce, Letters Vol. I, ed. by S. Gilbert, > 1957. Joyce took the offer, and ‚Ä≥The Sisters‚Ä≥ was published on 13 August 1904 using the pseudonym Stephen D√¶dalus, a name given to one of Joyce's semi- autobiographical literary characters in his later novels A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and Ulysses. ‚Ä≥The Sisters‚Ä≥ was the start of a series called Dubliners that he hoped the Homestead would continue to publish. In fact, Joyce would write two more stories for the Homestead, ‚Ä≥Eveline‚Ä≥ and ‚Ä≥After the Race,‚Ä≥ before complaints stopped the paper from publishing any more of his stories.Ellman, Richard (1959, 1982). James Joyce: New and Revised Edition, p. 164. University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, California. . Joyce, nevertheless, continued to add more stories to the collection. But, he had great difficulty getting Dubliners published, and it wasn't until 1914 that the first edition of the book came out. During that decade, ‚Ä≥The Sisters‚Ä≥ went through a number of revisions.Gifford,Don (1982). Joyce Annotated, p. 29. University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, California. . The two published versions have essentially the same plot. The diction, however, was transformed from a romantic style to a wholly modernist text. The Homestead version spelled much out for the reader. In the 1914 version, on the other hand, Joyce dropped the non-essential commentary leaving the facts to speak for themselves, a style Joyce called \\"scrupulous meanness.\\" Readers are left to interpret and feel the bare facts for themselves. The style demands a greater engagement by the reader who must now provide more interpretation of the facts. Other changes were made to characterisation and relationships. In particular, Joyce severely strengthened the relationship between the priest and the boy making it stand out as a memorable feature of the story.Gifford,Don (1982). Joyce Annotated, p. 29. University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, California. . Reception \\"The Sisters\\" has been a subject of scholarly debate, mostly in regards to the priest's illness. One analysis of Father Flynn's illness throughout the second version of the story shows that Joyce deliberately implied that Father Flynn had central nervous system syphilis. Joyce was interested and qualified enough in medicine to be able to describe a syphilitic and had definite reasons for doing so. The syphilitic nature of Father Flynn's illness is apparent in the author's use of paralysis, which was often used synonymously with paresis (general paralysis of the insane) when Joyce began his revisions in 1905.*Waisbren, Burton A. and Walzl, Florence L., \\"Paresis and the Priest: James Joyce's Symbolic Use of Syphilis in 'The Sisters,'\\" Annals of Internal Medicine, vol. 80, no. 6 (June 1974), pp. 758-762. The priest having suffered from a sexually transmitted infection would help account for the adult society's negative opinion and disdain for him.

It was signed at the state dacha near Viskuli in Belovezhskaya Pushcha on December 8, 1991, by the leaders of three of the four republics-signatories of the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR ‚Äì Russian President Boris Yeltsin and First Deputy Prime Minister of RSFSR/Russian Federation Gennady Burbulis, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and Ukrainian Prime Minister Vitold Fokin, Belarusian Parliament Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich and Prime Minister of Belarus Vyacheslav Kebich. The original accord could not be found as of 2013 (see below). Translation The name is variously translated as Belavezh Accords, Belovezh Accords, Belavezha Accords, Belavezha Agreement, Belovezhskaya Accord, Belaya Vezha Accord, etc. Legal basis and ratification While doubts remained over the authority of the leaders of three of the 12 remaining republics (the three Baltic republics had seceded in August) to dissolve the Union, according to Article 72 of the 1977 Soviet Constitution, Soviet republics had the right to secede freely from the Union. On December 12, 1991 the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR ratified the accords on behalf of Russia and at the same time denounced the 1922 Treaty on the Creation of the Soviet Union. While this is sometimes noted as the moment that the largest republic in the Soviet Union effectively seceded, this is not the case. Rather, the RSFSR appeared to take the line that it was not possible to secede from an entity that no longer existed. However, in the aftermath of the failed coup in August 1991, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union had been effectively dissolved and the republics were scrambling to pull free of Moscow. By the end of the summer of 1991, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev could no longer influence events outside of the Kremlin. He was being challenged even there by Yeltsin, who by the end of the fall had taken over most of the Soviet government. Xerography of Accords The preamble of the document stated that \\"the USSR, as a subject of international law and a geopolitical reality, is ceasing its existence\\". It also invited other republics to join the three founding members. On December 12, the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR formally ratified the Belavezha Accords, denounced the 1922 Union Treaty, and recalled the Russian deputies from the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. The legality of this ratification raised doubts among some members of the Russian parliament, since according to the Constitution of the RSFSR of 1978 consideration of this document was in the exclusive jurisdiction of the Congress of People's Deputies of the RSFSR.V.Pribylovsky, Gr.Tochkin .

There was some question as to whether the Belavezha Accords were enough in and of themselves to dissolve the Soviet Union, since they were signed by only three republics, albeit three of the five largest and most powerful republics. However, all doubts about whether the Soviet Union still existed were removed on December 21, 1991, when the representatives of 11 of the 12 remaining Soviet republics‚Äîall except Georgia‚Äîsigned the Alma-Ata Protocol, which confirmed the extinction of the Soviet Union and restated the establishment of the CIS. Given that 11 of the republics now agreed that the Soviet Union no longer existed, the plurality of member-republics required for its continuance as a federal state was no longer in place. The summit of Alma-Ata also provisionally accepted Gorbachev's resignation as president of the Soviet Union and agreed on several other practical measures consequential to the extinction of the Union. Gorbachev stated that he would resign as soon as he knew the CIS was a reality. Three days later, in a secret meeting with Yeltsin, he accepted the fait accompli of the Soviet Union's dissolution. However, for four more days a rump Soviet federal government continued to exist, and Gorbachev continued to hold control over the Kremlin. This ended in the early hours of December 25, 1991, when Gorbachev resigned and turned control of the Kremlin and the remaining powers of his office over to the office of the president of Russia, Yeltsin. Gorbachev's televised resignation speech and the subsequent lowering of the flag of the Soviet Union and hoisting of the flag of Russia on the flagpole in front of the Kremlin was broadcast around the world. On this day, President of the United States George H. W. Bush, a former head of the CIA, gave a short speech on national TV in the United States to commemorate the ending of the Cold War and to recognize the independence of the former states of the Soviet Union. Also on December 25, 1991, the Russian SFSR, now no longer a sub-national entity of the Soviet Union but a sovereign nation in its own right, adopted a law renaming itself the \\"Russian Federation\\" or \\"Russia\\" (both being equally official with the ratification of the Russian constitution in 1993). Gorbachev's speech and the lowering of the Soviet flag marked the end of the Soviet Union in the eyes of the world. However, the final legal step in the dissolution came a day later, when the Soviet of the Republics, the upper house of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, recognized the collapse of the Union and voted both itself and the Union out of existence. The lower house, the Soviet of the Union, had not met since December 12 when Russia recalled its deputies from both chambers, leaving it without a quorum. The Summit of Alma-Ata also issued a statement on December 21, 1991 supporting Russia's claim to be recognized as the successor state of the Soviet Union for the purposes of membership of the United Nations. On December 25, 1991, Russian President Yeltsin informed UN Secretary-General Javier P√©rez de Cu√©llar that the Soviet Union had been dissolved and that Russia would, as its successor state, continue the Soviet Union's membership in the United Nations. The document confirmed the credentials of the representatives of the Soviet Union as representatives of Russia, and requested that the name \\"Soviet Union\\" be changed to \\"Russian Federation\\" in all records and entries. This was a move designed to allow Russia to retain the Soviet Union's permanent Security Council seat, which would not have been possible if the former republics were all reckoned as equal successors of the Soviet Union, or if the Soviet Union was regarded as having no successor state for the purpose of continuing the same UN membership (see Russia and the United Nations). The Secretary General circulated the request, and there being no objection from any Member State, the Russian Federation took the Soviet Union's UN seat. On January 31, 1992, Russian Federation President Yeltsin personally took part in a Security Council meeting as representative of Russia, the first Security Council meeting in which Russia occupied the permanent Security Council seat originally granted to the Soviet Union by the UN Charter.

As a founding member of the Toronto School of Theology, students can avail themselves of the wide range of courses from Canada's largest ecumenical consortium. Wycliffe College trains those pursuing ministry in the church and in the world, as well as those preparing for academic careers of scholarship and teaching. History Old postcard depicting Wycliffe College In response to the Liberal Catholic perspective of Trinity College, which is the Toronto diocesan seminary, the Church Association of the Diocese of Toronto, a lay evangelical group at the Cathedral Church of St. James, founded the independent Protestant Episcopal Divinity School in 1877 to provide an alternative source for evangelical and low-church theological training. Like its Oxford counterpart, Wycliffe Hall, the name Wycliffe College was inspired by John Wycliffe, a 14th-century English scholastic philosopher, theologian, biblical translator, and reformer. The name was given first to the college's building and then to the college itself. To ensure its long-term viability, Wycliffe College began considering various forms of union with the University of Toronto towards the end of the 19th century. Wycliffe College became affiliated with the University of Toronto in 1885 and federated in 1889. Wycliffe College had a close association with the Anglican Church of the Epiphany in Parkdale. The church's founding rector, Bernard Bryan, had been one of the nine men who constituted the first class at Wycliffe in 1877. This connection continued in 1959 when the Church of the Epiphany's rector, Leslie Hunt, was appointed Principal of Wycliffe College.

Within its own federation, the University of Toronto granted degrees except theology or divinity degrees. Since 1978, by virtue of a change made in its charter, the University of Toronto has granted theology degrees conjointly with Wycliffe College and other TST member institutions. An act respecting Wycliffe College, being chapter 112 of the Statutes of Ontario, 1916, was repealed and the Wycliffe College Act, 2002 was substituted.http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/source/private/english/2002/elaws_src_private_pr02001_e.htm Wycliffe College Act, 2002, S.O. 2002, c.

It was mandated by the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (Brady Law) of 1993 and launched by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in 1998. After a prospective buyer completes the appropriate form, the holder of a Federal Firearms License (FFL) initiates the background check by phone or computer. Most checks are determined within minutes. If a determination is not obtained within three business days then the transfer may legally be completed. Background checks are not required under federal law for intrastate firearm transfers between private parties. Some states require background checks for firearm transfers. These states either require gun sales to be processed through an FFL holder, or they require that the buyer obtain a license or permit from the state. NICS experienced an unprecedented surge in the number of gun background checks in March and June 2020, tied to the COVID-19 pandemic and protests over the killing of George Floyd. Background Running background checks was discussed as early as the 1930s. The Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA) mandated that individual and corporate firearms dealers have a Federal Firearms License (FFL). It also created a system for keeping prohibited persons (e.g. a person determined to be prohibited of possessing a weapon due to criminal history or immigration status) from buying guns that relied upon buyers answering a series of \\"yes/no\\" questions such as, \\"Are you a fugitive from justice?\\". However, sellers, including FFL dealers, were not required to verify the answers. Coordinated efforts to create a national background check system did not materialize until after the assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan in March 1981. White House press secretary James Brady was seriously wounded in the attack, and afterward his wife, Sarah Brady, spearheaded the push to pass the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act in 1993. When signed into law in November of that year, the Brady Act included a GCA amendment that created the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). The Brady Act mandated that FFL dealers run background checks on their buyers. At first, the law applied only to handgun sales, and there was a waiting period (maximum of five days) to accommodate dealers in states that did not already have background check systems in place. Those dealers were to use state law enforcement to run checks until 1998, when the NICS would become operational and come into effect. In 1997, the Supreme Court ruled against the five-day waiting period, but by 1998 the NICS was up and running, administered by the FBI, and applied to all firearms purchases from FFL dealers, including long guns. Functionality After the prospective buyer completes and signs a Firearms Transaction Record (ATF Form 4473), the FFL contacts the NICS by telephone or Internet. When the background check is initiated three databases are accessed: the National Crime Information Center (NCIC), the Interstate Identification Index (III), and the NICS Index. According to the FBI, checks are usually determined within minutes of initiation. If there is no match in any of the checked databases, the dealer is cleared to proceed with the transfer. Otherwise, the FBI's NICS Section must contact the appropriate judicial and/or law enforcement agencies for more information. Per the Brady Act, the FBI has three business days to make its decision to approve or deny the transfer. If the FFL has not received the decision within that time it may legally proceed anyway. If the FBI later determines that the buyer is prohibited, it referred it to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to retrieve the firearm. In 2019, 261,312 federal background checks took longer than three business days. Of those, the FBI referred 2,989 to ATF for retrieval. The FBI stops researching a background check and purges most of the data from its systems at 88 days. This happened 207,421 times in 2019. States may implement their own NICS programs. Such states become the point of contact (POC) between their FFL dealers and the NICS. A few partial-POC states run FFL handgun checks, while the FBI runs long gun checks. FFLs in other, non-POC states access the NICS directly through the FBI. Authorized local, state, tribal, and federal agencies can update NICS Index data via the NCIC front end, or by electronic batch files. In addition, the NICS Section receives calls, often in emergency situations, from mental health care providers, police departments, and family members requesting placement of individuals into the NICS Index. Documentation justifying entry into the NICS Index must be available to originating agencies. Dead Link The ATF has designated some states' firearm possession or carry permits/licenses as exempting that person from the NICS background check requirement since ownership of such permits/licenses require a background check.  Notable claims of failures  After the Charleston Church shooting, FBI Director James Comey apologized for \\"lapses in the FBI‚Äôs background-check system\\", saying that \\"An error on our part is connected to this guy‚Äôs purchase of a gun\\". Dylan Roof's arrest and admission that he was in possession of Suboxone without a prescription a month prior to his purchasing a firearm would have disqualified him as a prohibited person under the Gun Control Act of 1968. An internal FBI report on Roof's background check cited gaps in the agency's databases and its policies for handling background checks, along with legal restrictions on how long it can maintain certain kinds of data, for the failure. On August 30, 2019, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the survivors and families of the deceased can sue the Federal government. In the wake of the Sutherland Springs church shooting, in which the gunman, 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley of nearby New Braunfels killed 26 and injured 20 others, the Fix NICS Act of 2017 was introduced in the 115th United States Congress. Kelley was prohibited by law from purchasing or possessing firearms and ammunition due to a domestic violence conviction in a court-martial while in the United States Air Force. The Air Force failed to record the conviction in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) National Crime Information Center database, which is used by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System to flag prohibited purchases. In the wake of the shooting, it emerged that the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General had issued reports flagging similar problems with criminal reporting in 1997 and 2015. The error in Kelley's case prompted the Air Force to begin a review. The attack was the deadliest mass shooting by one person in Texas and the fifth-deadliest mass shooting in the United States. Firearm denial appeals A buyer who believes that a NICS denial is erroneous may appeal the decision by either challenging the accuracy of the record used in the evaluation of the denial or claiming that the record used as basis for the denial is invalid or does not pertain to the buyer. The provisions for appeals are outlined in the NICS Regulations at Title 28, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 25.10, and Subsection 103 (f) and (g) and Section 104 of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993. According to the National Rifle Association, false positives in the NICS system deny citizens' Second Amendment rights. The NRA says that \\"there is significant reason to believe that the number of erroneous denials is far greater than those overturned on appeal\\" because some people may not appeal erroneous denials. In an operations report in 2014 by the FBI, of a total of 90,895 \\"deny transactions\\", 4,411 (about 5%) were overturned after further research by the NICS section. According to the report, \\"The primary reason for the overturned deny decisions in 2014 was the appellant's fingerprints not matching the fingerprints of the subject of the firearms-disqualifying record. Another chief reason deny decisions are overturned on appeal pertain to criminal history records that do not contain current and accurate information ... In cases where the matches are refuted by fingerprints, the NICS Section may overturn the subject's deny decision and allow the transaction to proceed. However, because the NICS is required to purge all identifying information regarding proceed transactions within 24 hours of notification to the FFL, in many instances, the process must be repeated when the same transferee attempts subsequent firearm purchases and is again matched to the same prohibiting record.\\" The NICS system however also includes a \\"Voluntary Appeal File\\" procedure, by which an individual may request that the NICS section retain their identifying information, rather than purging it, to prevent future erroneous denials or delays. Between November 30, 1998 and May 31, 2016, the NICS denied 1,323,172 transactions. The top reasons for denials include: \\"Convicted of a crime punishable by more than one year or a misdemeanor punishable by more than two years\\", \\"Fugitive from Justice\\", \\"Misdemeanor Crime of Domestic Violence Conviction\\" and \\"Unlawful User/Addicted to a Controlled Substance\\". In January 2016, USA Today reported that the FBI had stopped processing NICS denial appeals in October 2015, leaving a backlog of approximately 7,100 appeals as of January 20, 2016. The National Rifle Association said that the failure to review the appeals was a \\"gross disregard for those illegitimately denied their Second Amendment rights\\". Prohibited persons Under sections 922(g) and (n) of the GCA certain persons are prohibited from: *Shipping or transporting any firearm or ammunition in interstate or foreign commerce; *Receiving any firearm or ammunition that has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.

It is a leisurely paced domestic situation comedy. It was first published in newspapers on July 29, 1985.  Cast  The focus of the strip is tightly on its two title characters, a middle-aged, middle-class baby boomer couple with an easygoing approach to life. The family surname is Day, but it's only rarely used in the strip. Johnson confessed, \\"When I first sold the strip, the family had no name. The strip itself had no name! Preparing to launch, the syndicate brain trust decided, 'Let's make their name Day and call the strip Day by Day. ' However, it turned out there was an old, semi-defunct newspaper column called Day by Day, and legally timid heads prevailed. The strip was named Arlo and Janis. I subsequently kept the name ‚ÄòDay.‚Äô Why not?\\" Johnson, surveying his core cast, compared Gene, Janis and Arlo to Larry, Moe and Curly, respectively, with the family cat, Ludwig, corresponding to Shemp. *Arlo is Janis' husband. \\"He works for one of those vague, comic-strip corporations that survives year after year despite inept management, disgruntled workers and no apparent purpose.\\" Arlo is drawn wearing a tie when at work, and at home he wears jeans and a plain T-shirt. His character is generally laid back and ironic. He enjoys barbecues, and dreams and daydreams of sailing.That could take forever! http://arloandjanis.com/?p=642#comments He can be riled by injustice and marauding squirrels. He ponders the meaning of life, monitors his decline, and doesn't get enough exercise. He is in his late 40s. *Janis is Arlo's wife. Like Arlo, she is shown to have an undefined corporate job, at which she has been known to receive embarrassing faxes and emails from Arlo. Especially in earlier strips, she was portrayed as insecure about her looks (despite Arlo's sincere compliments) and, due to that insecurity, prone to \\"petty jealousies.\\" She worries about Arlo's health and about Gene growing up. Janis is sincere, straightforward, and works hard on her relationships. She gets plenty of exercise, and enjoys gardening. She has at times sunbathed secretly, despite the danger to her health.e.g., Caught Red-Handed http://arloandjanis.com/?p=780 \\"A highlight of the strip's run was when Janis bobbed her shoulder-length hair.\\" The first on-panel appearance of Ludwig, then referred to only as \\"the cat\\". *Gene (Eugene) is their son. Arlo and Janis were once frequently joined by their son, but as Gene slowly matured, his presence in the strip shrank dramatically. He is a good kid. Having been approximately eight years old when the strip was introduced, he received his driver's license May 26, 2003. By 2007, he's roughly eighteen when a week's worth of strips in June 2007 featured Gene's high school graduation. In August 2007 he is shown leaving home for college. Johnson maintained that Gene's diminished role in the strip was due to his wanting to show realistically the way that adolescents begin to lead their own lives. In time, Gene received more panel-time as his relationship with Mary Lou blossomed. The couple surprised Arlo and Janis with a small wedding ceremony in September 2012, and they seem to have been pronounced man and wife in a pantomime daily on September 20, 2012. They were presented as \\"Mr. and Mrs. Eugene Day\\" in the final panel of the next day's installment. *Ludwig the cat was first seen in the third panel of the daily published November 2, 1993, and has only more recently become a regular character. Except in fantasy sequences, Ludwig behaves like a real cat. One such sequence began with Ludwig suggesting to Arlo that \\"the role of the cat in this strip should be more anthropomorphic!\\"http://www.gocomics.com/arloandjanis/2013/04/09 On Johnson's blog, at least, he is often referred to as \\"Luddie\\", and his fans are identified as \\"Luddites\\".http://arloandjanis.com/?p=573 That darn cat 11/17/08 *Mary Lou is their daughter-in-law. She first appeared as a summer love whom young Gene met while on a family beach vacation in 1993. Johnson had brought her back into the strip on several occasions as early as Christmas 1993 and the summer of 1994, including the summers after Gene's first three years of college (2008, 2009 and 2010). Johnson said that Mary Lou had taken on an importance second only to the three main characters and Ludwig, and that she and her family are about the only recurring characters outside the immediate family. In 2009, Mary Lou, an unwed mother from a previous relationship, became Gene's first mature love interest and in 2010 Gene offered Mary Lou his great-grandmother's ring.Arlo & Janis Comics.com 6-18-10 ff In September 2012 she became Gene's wife. *Meg is Mary Lou's precocious daughter from an early relationship. *Other Cast Members: Mary Lou's father Gus often appears. Other characters take part in storylines on occasion, some as established \\"guest stars\\", but no other characters appear regularly in the strip, and few ever recur at all.  Content  Arlo and Janis strips are most often gag-a-day strips based on recurring themes, with only rarely any advancement of continuity. Readers may see themselves in Johnson's observations, and have written to his blog jokingly accusing Johnson of looking in their windows. Occasionally, Johnson strings together a few daily gags that, taken together, amount to the exploration of a topic. Only rarely does he create arcs of daily strips that together take on all the traditional elements of a story. Johnson wrote, \\"I‚Äôve always enjoyed serial strips, but they change the nature of the product. Ultimately, I think I prefer the gag-a-day format, done well. The 'done well' part is crucial. Of course, they can't be hilarious every day.\\" \\"Sometimes when I get on a roll with an extended conversation within a sequence of strips\\", Johnson observed, \\"the whole can be viewed like a short comic book.\\" Expressing a preference for timely, topical humor when available, Johnson wrote, \\"Given the choice (if they are the only two) between drawing a pedestrian comic related to some current event, thereby given it a shiny new sheen... or doing another Arlo-isn‚Äôt-listening-to-Janis gag even if it might be funnier, I‚Äôll choose the former.\\" He went on to observe, nevertheless, that topical humor tends to not hold up well over time. Johnson wrote that early on he experimented with short poems \\"when I wanted to do something a bit different or when I was stuck for a better idea.\\" In time it occurred to him that the limerick format was inherently comical and \\"fit the four-panel format\\" of the comic strip. Since the time of that realization, the limerick has been an occasionally recurring structure in the daily strip. Some of his recurring themes for jokes and storylines are touched on below: = Physical attraction = An example of the frequently suggestive content that the strip features. Many of the most notable jokes are based on sexual attraction, especially Arlo's desire for Janis. Despite having been a couple since meeting in college in 1973 (a backstory revealed in a series of strips that also functioned as a parody of the book and film Gone with the Wind), Arlo and Janis are still besotted with each other. The libidinous content of the strip can be surprisingly overt to readers accustomed to more sanitized newspaper comics. And in a medium where long marriages are often presented as either sexless or antagonistic (The Lockhorns, Andy Capp, etc.), these strips that show the couple's love and ongoing attraction to each other offer an alternative. \\"There has always been knowledge of sex in Arlo and Janis, and the fact that married people have sex,\\" Johnson said. \\"I think it's silly to ignore that humans have sex. It's like ignoring eating and sleeping.\\" Johnson also wrote, \\"I'd be willing to bet you five dollars I was the first cartoonist to depict a couple exchanging sexual fantasies in bed.\\" On the \\"Comics I Don't Understand\\" website, \\"The Arlo Award\\" is given to a cartoonist who slips something past the syndicate censors. Janis's negative body image has been a popular topic over the years. She sees herself as at least a little overweight, and unworthy of wearing a two-piece swimsuit. Arlo, on the other hand, persistently tries to convince her to put on the bikini again. =Office humor= The early years of the strip regularly featured office humor. Johnson claims he was \\"doing office humor when Scott Adams worked for the phone company,\\" but he used the theme less frequently over time. Johnson has attributed that decline to two factors. First, his memories of own his experiences in an office setting began to fade as he became ensconced in his cartooning, leaving him \\"neither inclined nor qualified to comment on 'the office.'\\" Second, he feels that with the concept of traditional \\"careers\\" falling by the wayside, his middle-aged title characters would tend to center their lives around relationships and home. Seldom were jobs even mentioned as time passed, and by 2017, Johnson felt he needed to address the suspicion of readers that Arlo and Janis were retired. While proclaiming they retained their usual undefined jobs, Johnson allowed that Arlo and Janis were in \\"that winding-down phase of employment.\\" = Battle of the sexes and species, and generations = Stereotypical gender differences between Arlo and Janis provide a lot of the strip's content. For example, Janis often accuses Arlo of not listening to her, and he pretends that he does. Arlo watches football and Janis complains about it. Arlo's envy of the cat Ludwig's idyllic lifestyle, sometimes veiled as criticism, fuels many strips. \\"I make it a rule to draw one cat cartoon a week,\\" Johnson writes. \\"I draw a cat cartoon every fifth or sixth Sunday. Other than that, I don't plan it. Sometimes, a cat cartoon will run late in the week, then on Sunday, then again early the next week. Inevitably, I will get mail of the ilk, 'I hate your stupid cat cartoons! That's all you do anymore! Why don't you throw yourself under a bus, you loser!' If I were a cat, I'd steer clear of those types.\\" Johnson's readers submit many stories of cute cats to his blog. Johnson also treats Arlo's envy of Gene's youth and freedom, and Arlo's ironic and sympathetic observation of Gene's unawareness of how much lies ahead. Janis is shown worrying that Gene is growing up‚Äîand away‚Äîbefore she is ready and she struggles to hold onto him. =Politics and history= The strip often includes political viewpoints. In particular, Arlo regularly rants about the damaging influence of large corporations on American society. One lengthy storyline examined American and Cuban relations. Another related the World War II experience of Arlo's father. =Modern life= Arlo and Janis humorously criticizes the pace, direction, and quality of modern American life. Arlo feels trapped on a \\"treadmill\\" and has questioned the wisdom of the entire disposable consumer economy on multiple occasions. In the strip on Sunday, November 30, 2008, this idea was reiterated by Janis: \\"You said we buy things we don't need with money we don't have.\\" Arlo counters with, \\"But the people who sell us the things we don't need depend on the money we don't have.\\" In August 2009, Arlo has gone up a tree to escape \\"the absurdity of modern living,\\" but he soon pines for a Kindle. So-called conveniences like cable television and cellular phones are examined. For example, the miniaturization of data storage devices is both trumpeted and lampooned in the November 3, 2007, daily, with Janis unable to find the tiny disk that conveniently holds all her photographs. The loss of privacy that has come with the internet is also mourned: \\"I still think it's creepy to go to a book or music web site and have it make suggestions of 'other titles you might enjoy,'\\" admits Johnson. = Surrealism, fantasy and metaphor = There are regular detours from \\"reality\\". In one case, Arlo \\"called in sick\\" to the strip and was replaced by a large, realistically drawn alligator for a week. Janis imagined a large dust-bunny named Harvey in another sequence, representing her feelings of house-keeping inadequacy. Janis has shared her fantasy of being a torch singer and Arlo has periodically \\"sailed away\\" from his mundane existence in extended daydreams. The courtship of a mermaid by a fisherman and a fable of the grasshopper and the ant were both played out by the Arlo and Janis characters. The fourth wall is sometimes broken, and readers sometimes are shown behind the scenes, with the \\"actors\\" preparing for the strip. For example, as Daylight Saving Time ended on November 4, 2012, nothing is happening, and Arlo implies that the reader has come in too early due to the time change, and that the \\"comic strip doesn't begin for another hour.\\" = Self-reference = There have been many meta-joke strips about the process of creating a daily comic strip, particularly about writer's block, with the character admitting (for the cartoonist) the absence of a joke or the reuse of a joke used before. Arlo's fondness for and the inclusion in the strip of the Mississippi-born singer/songwriter Jimmy Buffett reveal Johnson's musical taste, and his love of sailing mirrors Johnson's. Within the Sunday strip for January 1, 2012, Arlo affixes that same strip onto his freezer door, creating the infinity effect sometimes used on comic book covers, and also referencing that habit of comic strip readers to clip and post favorites. In the July 19, 2018 daily strip, Johnson steps out into full view. He draws himself drinking coffee at the drawing board. A blank sheet of paper awaits an inspiration.  Setting  Though it's unclear exactly where Arlo and Janis live, Johnson's southern upbringing regularly influences the strip, and it might be assumed that they live in or near a southern city such as Jackson, Mississippi, Birmingham, Alabama or Atlanta, Georgia. On the other hand, it snows quite a bit in their area. In a 2008 strip, Johnson put their home a four-hour drive from the coast, but he didn't reveal which coast. Johnson wrote in his blog on January 2, 2014, \\"I remember not long after I started drawing Arlo & Janis , I made a reference to eating peas on New Year's Day, and my editor in New York City expressed concern that might be a 'southern' tradition, and we didn't want to give newspaper editors the idea A&J; was a 'southern' strip. I guess she was afraid I'd start doing jokes about fatback and kissin‚Äô cousins.\\" Most of the action takes place in the home and the yard, both of which are portrayed with an economy of ink. In earlier years especially, a glimpse into the office environments of either Arlo or Janis might be given. There are occasional forays into the neighborhood, but there are few if any discernible landmarks there. The seashore is the favored vacation destination. Especially after Gene's marriage, the strip's setting expanded to include Gene's family's home, their farm, and their farm stand and cafe.  Origins of the characters' names  According to Johnson's ex-wife, the newspaper columnist Rheta Grimsley Johnson, the lead characters are named after 1960s music icons Arlo Guthrie and Janis Joplin, and their son after Eugene McCarthy.Johnson, Rheta Enchanted Evening Barbie and the Second Coming: A Memoir, NewSouth Books, 2010 , p90 Jimmy Johnson has said that Arlo was inspired by a friend with curly hair who resembles Guthrie, and the name Janis was \\"a marketing device used to attract the baby boom generation.\\" Some readers have suggested that the strip is autobiographical, because Janis and Rheta Grimsley Johnson are lookalikes, as are Johnson and Arlo. Rheta Grimsley Johnson confirms the physical resemblances, but states that the strip is not autobiographical, noting that they did not have any children, and that there is not a contrast between her personality and that of Johnson, unlike the personality differences in the strip between Arlo and Janis. Johnson expanded on and clarified the origins story in a 2020 blog entry: \\"When I was in college, I did a comic strip for the weekly student newspaper. It was about a hapless hippie (Yes, that term was alive and well back then.) named 'Arlo.' Indirectly, the character was named for Arlo Guthrie. I say 'indirectly,' because I had a buddy named Pat whom we had nicknamed 'Arlo,' because he had a shocking mane of long curly hair, much like the singer. Basically, I just wanted to annoy him. Years later, when I was developing the comic strip Arlo & Janis, I resurrected the name 'Arlo' for my male lead, because I think it has a certain comic quality. 'What name,' I thought, 'would pair well with 'Arlo?' It didn‚Äôt take long to come up with 'Janis.'‚Äù  Jimmy Johnson  Jimmy Johnson lives in the coastal city of Pass Christian, Mississippi. Although his own house was largely undamaged by Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, the devastation of his adopted hometown affected Johnson greatly; his blog at ArloAndJanis.com focused on little else for months afterward, and references to the hurricane appeared in the strip in the last third of 2005.  Reprint volumes  There has been one paperback reprint volume titled Arlo and Janis: Bop 'Till You Drop. It was published by Pharos Books in February 1989. The ISBN numbers assigned to it are: ; and . When offered for sale on Amazon.com, it is usually priced as a prized collectable. Johnson made mention in his blog of wanting to publish a twentieth anniversary volume for 2005. In 2008, after repeated inquiries by posters to his blog, the idea was revived on April 1, but on March 3, 2011, Johnson announced in his blog that the book deal had fallen through. Finally in November 2011, Johnson self-published Beaucoup Arlo & Janis, a 256-page, hard-bound collection of over 900 carefully selected A&J; comic strips with several introductory essays by the creator.

Johnson was born and grew up in Lanett, Alabama, graduating from Lanett High School in 1970. He is an alumnus of Auburn University where he was a member of Phi Kappa Tau fraternity, class of 1974. \\"My earliest cartoon work was copying Fred and Barney and Yogi Bear. I became quite proficient and was able to amaze my friends,\\" wrote Johnson. Johnson credits his mother with being especially supportive of his early artwork. Johnson noted an early endeavor related to his future profession in a 2020 blog entry: \\"When I was in college, I did a comic strip for the weekly student newspaper. It was about a hapless hippie (Yes, that term was alive and well back then.) named 'Arlo.' Indirectly, the character was named for Arlo Guthrie. I say 'indirectly,' because I had a buddy named Pat whom we had nicknamed 'Arlo,' because he had a shocking mane of long curly hair, much like the singer. Basically, I just wanted to annoy him.\\" As a young man just out of college, Johnson briefly worked as a reporter and in the public relations department of Auburn University. In the years before Arlo and Janis, from about 1980 to 1985, Johnson drew cartoons professionally for newspapers. He did so on a part-time basis when he was a reporter and editor, and then full-time as an editorial cartoonist in Jackson, Mississippi. While employed in this role, Johnson won the Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award. Beginning in 1985, Johnson drew Arlo and Janis for national syndication by the Newspaper Enterprise Association. Johnson said, \\"At the time I sold Arlo & Janis to the newspaper syndicate United Media in 1985, there were a lot of 'talking animal' strips. Newspaper editors reacted to this by demanding more comic strips about human beings, particularly young families. So, it really was a market-driven thing.\\" Johnson cites Mort Walker as an influence on his comic strip work, putting him at the head of \\"a cabal of talented and successful humorists who were redefining the newspaper comic strip in a post-war world.\\" Mel Lazarus, Johnny Hart, Dik Browne, Charles Schulz, Bud Blake are also mentioned. \\"As a youngster, I read them all in their heyday,\\" Johnson recalls. \\"These men were the primary influence upon me, and foremost among them was the enterprising and prolific Walker.\\" Naming other direct influences on his work, Johnson cites \\"the old Warner Bros. Looney Tunes animated cartoons, originally produced for theater audiences of all ages... Even as a kid, I could appreciate a subtle, grown-up wit that absolutely was missing in the Disney cartoons that dominated the scene in my day.\\" Johnson also describes himself as a \\"huge fan of Scrooge McDuck comic books and the work of Carl Barks.\\" Unsatisfied with the line- quality produced when he experimented with markers, Johnson draws the strip in traditional comic strip fashion, \\"with an old-fashioned pen nib and India ink on 2-ply Bristol paper.\\" But Johnson scans the finished drawings electronically for transmission to the syndicate editors. Syndicate colorists colored the daily strips until 2018, when Johnson took on the work. He has long used Photoshop to color the Sunday strips himself. In his comic strip about a small family, Johnson presents political and social commentary through his characters. Humor is also integral, and Johnson writes \\"jokes about many different subjects, not unlike stand-up comedians do.\\" Much of the strip's content is grounded in \\"Arlo and Janis' love and continued desire for each other.\\" Johnson's work is often sexually suggestive, and \\"the Arlo Award\\" is awarded to \\"cartoonists who slip one by the syndicate's censors.\\" Johnson was at one time married to author Rheta Grimsley Johnson, and the two remain good friends. As of 2006, despite the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina, he owns a home in Pass Christian, Mississippi. On April 3, 2006, he suffered a mild heart attack.

This movement followed the Old Lutheran movement and focused on a reassertion of the identity of Lutherans as a distinct group within the broader community of Christians, with a renewed focus on the Lutheran Confessions as a key source of Lutheran doctrine. Associated with these changes was a renewed focus on traditional doctrine and liturgy, which paralleled the growth of Anglo-Catholicism in England. An extract from Scherer's 1968 Ph.D. thesis, \\"Mission and Unity in Lutheranism\\". Scherer was Professor of World Mission and Church History at the Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago until his retirement. It was sometimes even called \\"German Puseyism\\". In the Roman Catholic Church in Germany, neo- Lutheranism was paralleled by Johann Adam M√∂hler. The chief literary organ of the neo-Lutheranism was Evangelische Kirchenzeitung, edited by Ernst Wilhelm Hengstenberg. Repristination versus Erlangen school Neo-Lutheranism developed as a reaction against the Prussian Union in a similar manner to the development of Tractarianism against the British Government's decision to reduce the number of Irish bishoprics. The term has been defined different ways to distinguish it from the Old Lutherans movement, which was a schism in areas where a church union was enforced. Also, a distinction developed in neo- Lutheranism whereby one side held to repristination theology which tried to restore historical Lutheranism, while the other held to the theology of the Erlangen School. The repristination theology group was represented by Ernst Wilhelm Hengstenberg, Carl Paul Caspari, Gustav Adolf Theodor Felix H√∂necke, Friedrich Adolf Philippi, and C.F.W. Walther. Repristination theology is more similar to later Confessional Lutheranism. In contrast, confessionalism to the Erlangen School was not to be static, but dynamic. The Erlangen School tried to combine Reformation theology with new learning. The Erlangen School included Franz Hermann Reinhold von Frank, Theodosius Harnack, Franz Delitzsch, Johann Christian Konrad von Hofmann, Karl Friedrich August Kahnis, Christoph Ernst Luthardt and Gottfried Thomasius. High Church Lutheranism However, neo-Lutheranism is sometimes called only theology and activity represented by Theodor Friedrich Dethlof Kliefoth, August Friedrich Christian Vilmar, Johann Konrad Wilhelm L√∂he, August Friedrich Otto M√ºnchmeyer and Friedrich Julius Stahl who had particularly high ecclesiology. They were polemic against idea of invisible church, strongly claiming church as an outward, visible institution of salvation and therefore laid emphasis on ordained ministry instituted by Christ and significance of sacraments above word as Means of Grace. However, unlike the Erlangen School, this neo- Lutheranism did not make lasting influence on Lutheran theology. Properly speaking, High Church Lutheranism began in Germany much later, 1917 the Hochkirchliche Vereinigung Augsburgischen Bekenntnisses was created, inspired by 95 theses Stimuli et Clavi, exactly 100 years after Claus Harms' 95 theses. Neo-Lutheranism should not be confused with term Neo-Protestantism, represented e.g. by Adolf von Harnack and his followers, which means exclusively liberal theology.

Together with Leon, Euxenon, and other young men from noble families, he helped assassinate Clearchus, the tyrant of Heraclea (353 BC). Most of the conspirators were killed by the tyrant's body guards, others were put to death later, after being tortured. Rule of the city passed to Clearchus' brother, Satyrus, who is generally considered to have been a worse tyrant than Clearchus.Memnon, History of Heracleia, 1; Justin, Epitome of Pompeius Trogus, xvi. 5 Seventeen surviving letters are ascribed to Chion, but they are no doubt spurious and may have been written by one of the later Platonists whose intention was to write an epistolary novel based on Chion's life. It has been very difficult to date them, but they are generally presumed to have been written in the 1st or 2nd century of our era. Some scholars are more cautious and prefer the 4th century. They were first printed in Greek in the Aldine collection of Greek Letters (Venice, 1499), then in Greek and Latin, in the 1606 reprint of that collection. The first separate edition was by Johannes Caselius in 1583 at Rostock. There was also a Latin translation published in the same volume with a Latin version of the fourth book of Xenophon's Cyropaedia by the same editor and printer the following year. An expanded edition of the Greek text, based on a new recension of some manuscripts in the Medicean collection, with notes and indices, was published by J. T. Coberus (Leipzig & Dresden, 1765). The best edition, containing all that is valuable in the preceding ones, is that of Johann Conrad Orelli in the same volume with his edition of Memnon (Leipzig, 1816). It contains the Greek text, the Latin version of Caselius, the introduction by Andreas Gottlieb Hoffmann, the preface of Coberus, and the notes of Coberus, Hoffmann, and Orelli. It was first translated into English by I. During (Gothenburg, 1951).

Composition At its core was a cube-shaped building block called a \\"Tog'l Block\\". Each side of the block had a hole or a pin that could be used to connect to the corresponding element (pins snapped into holes) on the side of another block. A chief advantage of Tog'l blocks over Lego (and similar) bricks is that a Lego brick can only attach to other bricks on two of its faces (top or bottom), while Tog'l blocks could attach to others on all six of its faces (each of its six faces could attach to another block). Another feature that gave the product its name was that one side had a hinge that allowed models built with Tog'l blocks to flex and move. Other building elements included wheels, axles, pinion gears, tubes, girders, air bellows, windows, doors, blue pins, green \\"hemisphere\\" pins, red double pins, clown heads, pig heads, hands, feet, and many other variations with generic uses or specific purposes.

Scotland The prospective advocate is placed under the care of a devilmaster, who traditionally must not be a Queen's Counsel. The pupil follows a programme of training as laid down by the Faculty of Advocates. The process has an ancient heritage, as it is the legal right of the Faculty of Advocates to admit persons as advocates to the Courts of Scotland. This right was apparently granted by the College of Justice. Ireland Devilling is a period of training undertaken by barristers in Ireland where they work under a more senior barrister (one who has been called for seven or more years but who is not a senior counsel) who is called their master. A barrister is called to the bar after successfully completing the course of barrister-at-law in the King's Inns, but during their first year of practice, they must devil for one year. It is common for barristers to also devil during their second year of practice. The work is generally unpaid and there is no obligation on the master to cover the costs of the devil. A barrister who has not devilled may still be recognised as fully qualified by the bar associations of other EEA member states, and practise in those member states in accordance with the relevant European Union (EU) directives. England and Wales The term is used in the English legal system to refer to a junior barrister undertaking paid written work on behalf of a more senior barrister. The instructing solicitor is not informed of the arrangement and the junior barrister is paid by the senior barrister out of his own fee as a private arrangement between the two. This is one of the exceptions to the usual prohibition on fee sharing under the Code of Conduct for Barristers in England and Wales. Treasury Devil The \\"Treasury Devil\\" is the colloquial term for the First Junior Treasury Counsel (Common Law), a private practitioner barrister who represents Her Majesty's Government in the civil courts, instructed by the Treasury Solicitor. It was a tradition that the Treasury Devil was made a High Court Judge after the end of his term in office. There is no current Treasury Devil. James Eadie QC, who was appointed in 2009 when he was already a QC, holds the position of First Treasury Counsel (Common Law).

His other creations include an angry manager with a conversational style and the worldview of Bernard Manning, Roger T Pigeon, and H:BOT 2000, a robot from the future. Each of these characters interact with both Big Howard and each other. Howard Read is also known for his on-stage human Guess Who? act: the audience guesses who he has drawn on a large pad of paper, sitting down as their questions exclude those of a certain appearance until only one person is left standing. In 1993, Howard Read invented NikNakNoodles - an amalgamation of Golden Wonder's Pot Noodle and Golden Wonder's other oddly-flavoured product, Nik Naks. Unfortunately the product was never mass-produced. Read is a regular contributor to Robin Ince's Book Club. Read also went on to work as a current writer for a Disney XD series Counterfeit Cat and is also a current writer for the new Danger Mouse series on CBBC.  Little Howard  Little Howard is a sketched cartoon child aged 6 who is a \\"standing-up comedian\\".

A recipient of the Israel Prize, he taught and served as director of the Rubin Academy of Music, now known as the Buchmann-Mehta School of Music in Tel Aviv.http://www.tau.ac.il/arts/music/Eindex.html √ñd√∂n P√°rtos  Biography  Partos was born in Budapest (at that time, part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire) and studied at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music, together with Antal Dor√°ti and M√°ty√°s Seiber, studied the violin with Jen≈ë Hubay and composition with Zolt√°n Kod√°ly. Upon completing his studies, he was accepted to the position of Principal Violinist in an orchestra in Lucerne, after which he played in other European orchestras, among them, in Berlin. In 1934, following Hitler‚Äôs ascendance to power, Partos returned to his birthplace, Budapest, where he was Principal Violinist in the city‚Äôs symphony orchestra. In 1936, Bronis≈Çaw Huberman founded the Palestine Orchestra (now: Israel Philharmonic Orchestra), for which he recruited Jewish musicians cast out of Europe's orchestras. Huberman sought to include Partos, though the latter's take-up of the post was delayed due to a prior commitment ‚Äì a contract with the government of the USSR through which Partos taught violin and composition in the Conservatory of Baku, Azerbaijan. In 1937, Partos left the USSR, after having refused to join the Communist Party during the period of the Moscow Trials. He returned to Budapest, where he served as the orchestra‚Äôs Principal Violinist along with making concert tours of European countries. At that time, Bronis≈Çaw Huberman invited Partos to a meeting in Florence, where he offered him the position of Principal Violist in the Palestine Orchestra. Declining attractive offers from South America (notably, Peru), Partos immigrated to British Mandatory Palestine in 1938. Between the years 1938‚Äì1956, Partos was the principal of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra's viola section, as well as playing numerous solo performances in Israel and abroad. In 1946, together with cellist L√°szl√≥ Vincze, he founded the Samuel Rubin Israel Academy of Music (now: Buchmann-Mehta School of Music) in Tel Aviv, and in 1959 was instrumental in founding the Thelma Yellin High School of Art in Tel Aviv. In 1951, Partos was appointed director of the Rubin Academy, a position he was to hold until his death (although the state of his health during his last five years of life prevented him from taking an active part in the Academy's administration, a position filled by Prof. Arie Vardi who succeeded him as director there). √ñd√∂n Partos is regarded as among the most important Israeli composers. He was awarded the Israel Prize in 1954, the first honoree in the field of music. Among the notable students of Partos: Cecylia Arzewski, Dvora Bartonov, Menahem Breuer, Ilan Gronich, Rami Solomonow, Rivka Golani, Rami Bar-Niv, Yehoshua Lakner , Avraham Sternklar, Shelemyahu Zacks, and Noa Blass .

A New York Times bestselling novel, It was the first in his The Fourth Realm Trilogy. Book two,The Dark River, was published in July 2007. The final part in the trilogy, The Golden City, was released September 8, 2009. The trilogy has been translated into 25 languages and has sold more than 1.5 million books. Setting The book is set in the near future in a world where the real power lies in the hands of a secret organisation who call themselves the Brethren and are called by their enemies as the Tabula. The Tabula are a centuries-old secret society who believe in the importance of control and stability. The Tabula wish to enforce a Virtual Panopticon: a society where all individuals become so accustomed to being watched and monitored that they act at all times as if they were being observed and are as such completely controllable. This Virtual Panopticon is made possible through the use of surveillance cameras, centralized databases, RFID-like tags for each citizen, and assorted spy gear. The Tabula consider Travelers to be a threat to their control. The Travelers are individuals with a special gift which allows them to detach from their bodies and journey through elemental barriers to other realms. Pathfinders are individuals capable of teaching potential Travelers how to break free from their body. Harlequins are specially trained warriors who are committed to protecting Travelers. Travelers, Pathfinders, and Harlequins are hunted by the Tabula. Plot summary Maya, a young woman, is trying to live the life of a normal citizen. Her background, on the other hand, is anything but normal. She is the daughter of a famous German Harlequin named Thorn, who had been badly injured in an ambush by the Brethren. On a mission she killed two men of the Yakuza, the Japanese mafia. As a consequence Maya had tried to hide and leave her Harlequin past behind until one day her handicapped father calls for her. When visiting him in Prague, she finds him slaughtered by his enemies. Fulfilling her father's last wish, Maya takes a flight to the States supporting Shepherd, the last American Harlequin. She is determined to help him defend the last two potential Travelers alive. However, Shepherd has become a member of the Brethren. Working for the other side now, he tries to kill Maya. With the help of a young woman named Vikki she is lucky to get away. Vikki is a member of the I. T. Jones Church, a church of followers of the Traveler Isaac T. Jones, who was killed by the Brethren in 1889 with a harlequin. Together they are able to find an ally, Hollis, a Capoeira trainer from Los Angeles and a former member of the Isaac T. Jones Community. The three of them search for potential Travelers Michael and Gabriel Corrigan. Maya and her companions find Gabriel, but Michael is captured by the Brethren. The Brethren recently started a new program. They were in contact with a technologically advanced civilization dwelling in another realm who offer the Brethren high technology, weapons and plans for a quantum computer. The Brethren want to use a Traveler that can find this other civilization and guide it to the Earth. By offering Michael power, money and everything else he wants, the Brethren convince him to work for them. With a new drug called 3B3, Michael is able to leave his realm. While Michael gains his first experiences with other realms, Maya tries to find a Pathfinder for Gabriel. Hollis stays in Los Angeles to place a false track. The Brethren show up at his house and try to kill him with a new weapon called ‚ÄúSplicer,\\" some kind of genetically engineered animal designed to search and destroy, but Hollis defeats them. Maya and Gabriel find a Pathfinder in the desert in Arizona. While teaching Gabriel how to cross over, she tells him everything she knows about the Travelers and the six realms. There is the first realm of a town like hell, the second realm of a city full of \\"hungry ghosts\\", the third is inhabited by animals ignorant of all others, the fourth realm is our own reality, where the sin is desire, the fifth realm is the reality of the \\"half gods\\", where the sin is jealousy, and the sixth realm of the \\"gods\\" themselves, where the sin is pride. The \\"gods\\" and \\"half-gods\\" of the fifth and sixth realm are not meant like God as the creator of all life, but like the Tibetans describe them: human beings from parallel worlds. The realms are separated each by four barriers: one barrier of fire, one of water, one of earth and one of air. A Traveler that is capable of passing these four barriers is then able to enter one of the five other realms. If his body on earth dies, his soul, called the light, is condemned to stay forever in the realm it visits at that time. Crossing over into other realities, a Traveler can only carry special objects, called talismans, with him. Such an object is the sword Gabriel‚Äôs father gave him. Equipped with this sword, he meets his brother in the realm of the hungry ghosts. His brother tries to convince him to join the Brethren. Gabriel resists the temptation, but he tells his brother where he left his body. As a consequence Gabriel is imprisoned by the Brethren within hours and brought to the research centre where Michael is kept. Maya realizes that an immediate counterstrike is necessary. After a battle in the Brethren's research facility, they free Gabriel but realize that they can not convince Michael to leave the Brethren. Maya and her allies are able to find refuge in a house on a beach in Cape Cod to recover. Literary significance and reception David Pitt in his review for Booklist said that John Twelve Hawks is \\"a gifted storyteller, makes this surreal and vaguely supernatural good-versus-evil story entirely believable.\\" About the novel he says that the \\"pace is fast, the characters intriguing and memorable, the evil dark and palpable, and the genre-bending between fantasy and thriller seamless\\". The New York Times reviewer Janet Maslin began her review with the statement: \\"It takes outlandish nerve and whopping messianic double talk to inaugurate a new science fiction project on the scale of The Traveler.\\" She then concluded, \\"Amazingly, this novel sustains a new voice even when its roots show. And the list of obvious influences is long indeed. There are traces of Star Wars, The Matrix, Kill Bill and Minority Report. There are echoes of Stephen King, Michael Crichton, Joseph Campbell, Jeremy Bentham, various samurai stories and (could it not have been thus?) The Da Vinci Code.\\" Film adaptation On March 23, 2012, Deadline Hollywood announced that Warner Bros. acquired film rights to the Fourth Realm Trilogy. The Traveler music album In October 2014, British DJ and Bedrock Records producer John Digweed and his partner Nick Muir released an album inspired by The Traveler. John Twelve Hawks made the initial contact, sending Digweed his novel with a note saying it had been written while listening to Digweed‚Äôs Transitions radio show. After reading The Traveler Digweed immediately emailed Hawks to say how much he‚Äôd loved the novel. Eighteen months later Digweed found an email from Hawks in his junk folder and they finally arranged to collaborate. Initial attempts to record Hawks‚Äô narration via Skype failed, forcing Hawks to make a rare personal appearance in the studio. Digweed and Muir met with John Twelve Hawks in the UK and recorded his voice as he read passages from the novel. Hawks's voice was changed electronically and woven into the 13 tracks. Reaction to the album was positive. Music critic Rich Curtis called it \\"a very engaging and superbly crafted meeting of artistic minds.\\" ReferencesExternal links * The Traveler official book site * The Traveler, by John Twelve Hawks * Interview with John Twelve Hawks about The Traveler * The Fourth Realm Site Semi- fictional and semi-official forum, established by John Twelve Hawks Category:2005 American novels Category:American science fiction novels Category:Novels by John Twelve Hawks Category:2005 science fiction novels Category:Doubleday (publisher) books ","title":"The Traveler (novel)"},{"id":"2738286","text":"Luca Fancelli (c. 1430 - c. 1502) was an Italian architect and sculptor. Biography Corte Ghirardina, Motteggiana, constructed by Luca Fancelli. Torre dell'Orologio of the Palazzo della Ragione, Mantua, constructed by Luca Fancelli in 1473. Fancelli was born in Settignano, a fraction of Florence. Much of his life and work is an enigma; what is known for sure is that he trained as a stonecutter and mason and studied under Brunelleschi. Giorgio Vasari, the 16th-century Florentine artist and biographer of the artists, is responsible for many doubts pertaining to the authenticity of works attributed to Fancelli. While Fancelli likely designed the Palazzo Pitti, the Florentine residence of the Medici's friend, and supposed rival, Luca Pitti; Vasari attributes the design to Brunelleschi, who had died several years before work began. The palazzo is not in Brunelleschi's style, and considered by many to be by a lesser hand. Fancelli has also been credited also with the design of the tribune of SS. Annunziata in Florence, but this too is disputed. In 1450 Fancelli moved to Mantua, where he was employed in the court of Marquis Ludovico III. Mantua under the Gonzagas was artistic center, employing Pisanello, Mantegna, Perugino, Correggio, Leon Battista Alberti, Giulio Romano, and Rubens. At Mantua, Fancelli became clerk of works and supervisory architect for the churches of San Sebastiano (1460), and Sant'Andrea (1472) while the plans for both churches were drawn by Alberti himself, Fancelli's input was large, especially at the church of Sant'Andrea, which was begun only shortly before Alberti's death. The Marquess of Mantua Federico I began work on a new royal palace in the city, and Fancelli received the commission to design a complex of rooms for new palace centred on its clock tower, this wing known as the Domus Nova (\\"New House\\"). Fancelli worked on from 1478 to 1484, but the palace itself remained incomplete until the 17th century. The final years of Fancelli's life are characteristically enigmatic; he disappears from all written references from 1494.

He was managing director of Great Universal Stores (G.U.S. or Gussies) 1932‚Äì1947 and chairman 1947‚Äì1987. He established the Wolfson Foundation to distribute most of his fortune to good causes. Great Universal Stores was a mail order business. He joined the company as a merchandising controller in 1932, becoming joint managing director in the same year. The company was in trouble when he joined but he turned it round and made it into a very strong business and the principal source of his wealth. He also had other successful business ventures. He was succeeded by his son Leonard Wolfson. Early life Isaac Wolfson was the son of a Jewish cabinet maker, Solomon Wolfson, an immigrant from Rajgr√≥d, PolandBut Aris, p. 97, says BialystockHis parents were married in the town of Goniadz in Grodno Gubernia on 8 May 1893 who settled in the Gorbals in Glasgow, Scotland. His mother was Nechi Surah Wilamowski. He was educated at Queen's Park School, Glasgow. He was highly capable in mathematics but could not afford to train as an accountant so he became a salesman for his father, who made cheap tables and chairs for local people. He is said to have been a brilliant salesman. At this time he made many business friends who worked with him ever afterwards. In 1920 he left for London. There he started his own business, selling clocks, mirrors and upholstery. In 1926 he married Edith Specterman. His father-in-law owned a chain of suburban cinemas and helped him financially in his early days. Great Universal Stores In 1930 he was exhibiting at a trade fair in Manchester City Hall. George Rose was then a director of Great Universal Stores, only just renamed from mere Universal Stores. Rose liked Wolfson's display and ordered 500 clocks, which for Wolfson at the time was a big order. Rose took Wolfson to lunch and showed him the G.U.S. Devonshire Street factory. Soon Wolfson was G.U.S.'s chief buyer but he retained his own business and from G.U.S. took profit share and share options in lieu of salary. Universal Stores was founded in 1900 by Abraham, George and Jack Rose. The company developed a mail-order trade, sending out small (by later standards) catalogues. In 1931, just after Wolfson joined, it went public but got into serious trouble and the shares plummeted. There were a number of reasons: financial inexperience, an ill-advised move from Manchester to London, a fire and the recession. These troubles hastened the death of Abraham who was already a sick man. Wolfson gradually acquired shares from the Rose brothers using cash lent by his father-in-law and by Archibald Mitchelson, who was a friend. In 1932 he became joint Managing Director with George and in 1934 sole Managing Director. In his first eighteen months Wolfson streamlined and rationalised the company. A loss of ¬£55,000 in 1932 became a profit of ¬£330,000 the next year. From 1934 onwards Wolfson acquired companies with large hire purchase debts and property assets, some for G.U.S. and some for his own business. These acquisitions provided cash for more acquisitions. Acquired companies included Midland and Hackney, Drages, Alexander Sloan, Jays and Campbells, British and Colonial and Smart Brothers. Wolfson was too old to go to war. As World War II approached and during the war he continued to buy. He reasoned that if Hitler won the war his businesses would be finished anyway but if not then the opportunities would be enormous. In 1932, G.U.S. was worth ¬£700,000, in 1938 ¬£1,980,000 but by 1948 it was ¬£16 million. This remarkable growth rate and aggressive acquisition plan was then succeeded by a gentler growth rate and a more corporate style. By 1970 Wolfson had sold his private business and handed over control of G.U.S. to his son Leonard. Other business interests Wolfson was a brilliant financier and this was central to his early success. Later he backed James Goldsmith. He also underwrote the hire purchase agreements of washing machine entrepreneur John Bloom at Rolls Razor but withdrew financial support in 1964, leading to the company's voluntary liquidation. In 1954 Wolfson was part of Kemsley- Winnick Television, which won the initial ITV weekend contracts for the Midlands and the North of England. However, shortly after the award of the contracts the consortium was shown not be have the financial backing required, causing it to collapse. Religion and philanthropy Wolfson was a devout orthodox Jew. He followed the example of his father and the middle-European community from which he came. He is quoted as having said, \\"No man should have more than ¬£100,000. The rest should go to charity\\". He gave immense amounts to charities: from 1948 he included Zionist charities at the urging of his friend Israel Sieff. In 1962 he was appointed president of the United Synagogue, the first to be selected from descendants of the nineteenth century waves of immigrants. In 1955, Wolfson established the Wolfson Foundation, to aid in the advancement of education, health and youth activities. This supported the establishment of Wolfson College, Oxford (where he was a Founder Fellow), Wolfson College, Cambridge, the Wolfson Building at Somerville College, Oxford, the Wolfson Building at Trinity College, Cambridge, and the Wolfson Room at St David's College, among many other projects over the years; he thus became the only non-religious figure to have a college named after him at both Oxford and Cambridge. Professorships named after him exist at Bar-Ilan, Haifa, Jerusalem, Oxford and Tel Aviv. He was also a benefactor of the John Rylands Library donating the cost of a small extension in 1961. The Edith and Isaac Wolfson Trust financed two housing projects in Israel, both called Kiryat Wolfson, and the family supported the founding of Wolfson Medical Center in Tel Aviv. Personal life Until 1960 Wolfson lived in Worcester; he then moved to London. He received a baronetcy in the Queen's 1962 New Year's Honours list, becoming Baronet as Sir Isaac Wolfson of St. Marylebone on 19 February 1962. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1963 under Statute 12. In 1971, he was awarded the Freedom of the City of Glasgow. He died in Israel in 1991, aged 93. Wolfson's wife, the former Edith Specterman, was a Vice-President of the English Jewish Welfare Board. Isaac and Edith Wolfson's only child, a son Leonard, was born in 1927.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. The station is operated by Northern Trains. History The station, opened by the CLC on 1 August 1873, was originally known as Farnworth (Widnes), Farnworth being at the time a village north of Widnes, but is now a northern suburb of the town. The station was renamed Widnes North on 5 January 1959, and finally Widnes on 6 May 1968 ( and , on other lines, having closed to passengers in 1964 and 1962 respectively). Plaque Widnes railway station is generally said to be the station where Paul Simon reputedly composed the song \\"Homeward Bound\\" though some think it more likely that it was Ditton railway station, part of the Widnes Loop Line and the train to London.

The station was refurbished in 2009 and as of 2010 houses a station shop and a beauty parlour, though there are still no toilet or waiting facilities for passengers other than the already existent shelter on the Manchester-bound platform. The platforms and footbridge have recently been refurbished. A ticket machine has been installed on the Manchester-bound platform.

The portraits were produced as watercolours and turned into chromolithographs for publication in the magazine. These were then usually reproduced on better paper and sold as prints. Such was his influence in the genre that all Vanity Fair caricatures are sometimes referred to as \\"Spy cartoons\\" regardless of who the artist actually was. Early portraits, almost always full-length (judges at the bench being the main exception), had a stronger element of caricature and usually distorted the proportions of the body, with a very large head and upper body supported on much smaller lower parts. Later, as he became socially accepted in the society in which he moved to gain access to his subjects, and not wishing to cause offence, his style developed into what he called \\"characteristic portraits\\", being less of a caricature and more of an actual portrait of the subject, using realistic body proportions. Background \\"Tommy\\" Bowles, founder of Vanity Fair, caricatured by Leslie Ward in 1889 Ward was one of eight children of artists Edward Matthew Ward and Henrietta Ward, and the great-grandson of the artist James Ward. Although they had the same surname before marriage, Ward's parents were not related. Both were well-known history painters, his mother coming from a line of painters and engravers, including her father, the engraver and miniature painter George Raphael Ward, and her grandfather, the celebrated animal painter James Ward. She was niece and great-niece respectively of the portrait painter John Jackson and the painter George Morland. Both parents had studios in their homes in Slough and Kensington in London, where they regularly entertained the London artistic and literary elite. Ward's father was a gifted mimic who entertained Charles Dickens and other eminent guests. Although they never gave their son formal training, they and their artistic friends encouraged the young Ward to draw, paint, and sculpt.Leslie Ward (1915), Forty Years of \\"Spy\\", London: Chatto and Windus. . Ward had started caricaturing while still at school at Eton College, using his classmates and school masters as subjects. In 1867 his bust of his brother was exhibited at the Royal Academy in London. At school Ward had been an unexceptional student, and after he left Eton in 1869 his father encouraged him to train as an architect. Ward was too afraid to tell his father that he wanted to be an artist and he spent an unhappy year in the office of the architect Sydney Smirke, who was a family friend. The artist W. P. Frith spoke to Ward's father on his behalf, and after a great deal of arguing he finally agreed to support his son's training as an artist, and Ward entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1871. In 1873 he sent some of his work to Thomas Gibson Bowles, four years after Vanity Fair was founded. This led to him being hired to replace \\"Ape\\" (Carlo Pellegrini), who had temporarily left the magazine after falling out with Bowles. As his nom de crayon, Ward suggested to Bowles that he use the name \\"Spy\\", meaning \\"to observe secretly, or to discover at a distance or in concealment\\". Ward's Spy signature was similar to Pellegrini's stylised Ape. Vanity Fair Leslie Ward caricatured in 1889 by 'Pal' Ward drew 1,325 cartoons for Vanity Fair between 1873 and 1911, many of which captured the personality of his subjects. His portraits of royalty, nobility, and women, however, were over-sympathetic, if not sycophantic. Later, as he became a member of Society himself, he became even more of a complimentary portraitist, moving from caricature to what he termed \\"characteristic portraits\\", a charge he acknowledged in his autobiography Forty Years of \\"Spy\\", published in 1915.Peter Mellini (2004) \\"Ward, Sir Leslie [Spy] (1851‚Äì1922)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press. . Ward worked methodically, often from memory, after observing his 'victims' at the racecourse, in the law courts, in church, in the academy lecture theatre, or in the lobby of the Houses of Parliament. Sometimes they came to his studio to pose in their robes or uniforms. A caricaturist, Ward believed, was born, not made. He observed, \\"A good memory, an eye for detail, and a mind to appreciate and grasp the whole atmosphere and peculiarity of the 'subject' are of course essentials.\\" A caricature, he noted, should never depend on a physical defect, nor should it be forced. \\"If I could sum up the art in a sentence it would be that caricature should be a comic impression with a kindly touch, and always devoid of vulgarity.\\"R. T. Matthews (June‚ÄìJuly 1976), \\"Spy\\", British History Illustrated, 2, pp. 50‚Äì57 In an 1897 interview given by Oliver Armstrong Fry (editor of Vanity Fair) to Frank Banfield of Cassell's Magazine, it was reported that Ward received a sum of between ¬£300 and ¬£400 for a portrait. Ward was the most famous Vanity Fair artist; indeed, the whole genre tends to be named after him, the caricatures often being referred to as \\"Spy cartoons\\". He worked for Vanity Fair for over forty years, producing more than half of the 2,387 caricatures published. Later years Ward's clubs included the Arts, the Orleans, the Fielding, the Lotus, the Punch Bowl, and the Beefsteak, where he was one of the original members. There he sketched many of his victims. In 1899, years after her father had refused him permission to marry her, Ward married the society hostess Judith Mary Topham-Watney, the only daughter of Major Richard Topham of the 4th Queen's Own Hussars. They had one daughter, Sidney. Ward's last cartoon for Vanity Fair appeared in June 1911 as he had recently begun to contribute his \\"characteristic portraits\\" to The World and Mayfair. He supplemented his income by painting portraits. In 1918 he was knighted. Ward prophesied that \\"when the history of the Victorian era comes to be written in true perspective, the most faithful mirror and record of representative men and spirit of their times will be sought and found in Vanity Fair\\". After a nervous breakdown Ward died suddenly of heart failure at 4 Dorset Square, Marylebone, London on 15 May 1922 and was buried on 18 May at Kensal Green Cemetery in London. About 300 of his original watercolours for Vanity Fair are in the National Portrait Gallery, London. Gallery File:Guglielmo, Marchese Marconi. Colour lithograph by Sir L.

In 2009, he was released from Guantanamo after France agreed to accept him. He was transported there on November 30, 2009, and lives in Bordeaux.

These hearings were designed to assess the threat a detainee might pose if released or transferred, and whether there were other factors that warranted his continued detention. Lahmar chose to participate in his Administrative Review Board hearing.[ Summarized transcript (.pdf)], from Sabir Mahfouz Lahmar's Administrative Review Board hearing - page 115  Habeas corpus and release  Lahmar was one of six Algerian nationals whose petitions for habeas corpus reached the United States Supreme Court. In 2008 it ruled on them together under Boumediene v. Bush, deciding that detainees and foreign nationals were covered by constitutional protections allowing them to sue for habeas corpus. The Bush administration had contended that detainees at Guantanamo had no rights under the constitution. The cases were referred to US District Court for review. US District Court Judge Richard Leon ruled in September 2008 on Saber's habeas corpus petition. He concluded that there was no evidence to support classifying him as an \\"enemy combatant\\", and that he should be released. He made the same ruling for four other Bosnians of Algerian descent. Lahmar was transferred to French territory for release on November 30, 2009. Noting that Lahmar would \\"finally begin to live a normal life again\\", the French foreign ministry pledged to help re-integrate him into society. In its coverage of his release the Washington Post noted that Leon's September 2008 ruling had ordered his release \\"forthwith\\". Three other men were transferred when Lahmar was released. A Palestinian captive was transferred to Hungary. His name was not released, and authorities did not report whether he was being detained in Hungarian custody or set free. Two Tunisian captives, Adel Ben Mabrouk, and Mohamed Ben Riadh Nasri, were transferred to the custody of Italy. Lahmar was arrested in Bordeaux in May 2017. He was suspected to be a member of an alleged ISIL recruiting network.  See also  * Boumediene v.

Since 1965 the district has been part of the London Borough of Croydon within Greater London. History A local board of health was formed for the parish of Croydon St John the Baptist in 1849. On 9 March 1883 the town received a charter of incorporation to become a municipal borough. The borough was granted a commission of the peace and a separate court of quarter sessions in 1885 and 1889 respectively.Kelly's Directory of Kent, Surrey and Sussex (1891), pp. 1199‚Äì1204 Under the Local Government Act 1888 it became an autonomous county borough in 1889. The area of the original borough included part of Norwood and Addiscombe, Bensham, Croham, Coombe, Haling, Norbury, Shirley, Waddon and Woodside. From 1894 to 1915 it was adjacent to Croydon Rural District to the south, east and west and the County of London to the north. The rural district was abolished in 1915, but the county borough was unsuccessful in its attempt to annex the area. The only significant extension of the borough boundaries was in 1925, when the parish of Addington was absorbed.F A Youngs Jr, Guide to the Local Administrative Units of England, Vol 1, London 1979 The borough ran trams until they became the responsibility of the London Passenger Transport Board in 1933. The borough ran its own fire brigade and ambulance service until it became a London Borough. In 1954 Croydon Corporation unsuccessfully petitioned the Queen for the grant of city status. At the time, Croydon was the only county borough with a population in excess of 200,000 not to be a city.Claim for city status, The Times, 1 March 1954 In 1965 the county borough was abolished and its former area transferred to Greater London to be combined with that of Coulsdon and Purley Urban District to form the London Borough of Croydon. =Corporation= On incorporation the borough was divided into six wards (Central, East, South, South Norwood, Upper Norwood and West) each returning six councillors. Together with 12 aldermen and a mayor, these formed the town council. In 1905 a new North ward was formed, and the council was enlarged to 14 aldermen and 42 councillors.Kelly's Directory of Surrey, pp. 97 - 98 By 1918 a new ward of Bensham Manor had been created and on further enlargement in 1925 Addington ward was formed, with the numbers of aldermen and councillors being increased to 18 and 54 respectively. The wards were reorganised in 1930, with 15 wards each returning three councillorsSam Davies and R E Morley, County Borough Elections in England and Wales, 1919-1938: A Comparative Analysis, London, 1999, pp.145 -162 From then until the abolition of the county borough the council consisted of the mayor, 15 aldermen and 45 councillors. The 1930 wards were: *Addington *Addiscombe *Bensham Manor *Broad Green *Central *East *Norbury *South *South Norwood *Thornton Heath *Upper Norwood *Waddon *West Thornton *Woodside *Whitehorse Manor The wards were slightly reorganised with the creation of Shirley ward and the amalgamation of two wards as \\"South and Waddon\\" by 1955.The Parliamentary Constituencies (Croydon) Order, 1955 (S.I. 1955 No. 174) =Politics= From its incorporation the council was controlled by parties allied to the Conservative Party, known as the Coalition Party or Ratepayers Association. The Ratepayers Association was more formally organised as an anti-Labour Party grouping after 1900, and was supported by both the Conservatives and the Liberals, who seldom fielded candidates. Croydon was constituted a parliamentary constituency in 1885, with the same boundaries as the borough. In 1918 the county borough was divided into North and South constituencies. For the general election of 1950 representation increased to three: Croydon North, East and West. In 1955 the boundaries were altered to create Croydon North East, North West and South. Coat of arms The municipal borough was granted a coat of arms on 16 October 1886 by the College of Arms, and this was inherited by the county borough. With its quartered shield and its complicated design, the coat of arms was in a style typical of grants to municipal corporations by Albert Woods, then Garter Principal King of Arms. Most of the emblems on the shield were related to the Archbishops of Canterbury, who had a palace in Croydon. The three choughs are associated with Thomas Becket and appear in the arms of the city of Canterbury. The cross crosslets came from the arms of the Diocese of Canterbury. The flory cross bearing three gold discs was taken from the arms of Archbishop John Whitgift. The embattled fesse in the fourth quarter represented a town wall and thus municipal government. The crest on top of the helm featured a grassy mound and heraldic fountain, for the Croydon Bourne. On either side was a sprig of rye- grass, for the irrigation meadows of Beddington Sewage Farm. The crest also contained a gold crozier, another reference to the archbishops, and a crossed sword and tilting spear for the East India Company Military Seminary at Addiscombe. The motto, which was in Latin, was Sanitate Crescimus (\\"May we grow in health\\").C. W. Scott-Giles, Civic Heraldry of England and Wales, 2nd edition, London, 1953 Some charges from these arms were used, together with some charges from the coat of arms of Coulsdon and Purley Urban District, to form the new coat of arms of the London Borough of Croydon in 1965.

Biography Christian de Castries was born into a distinguished military family: the House of Castries; and enlisted in the army at the age of 19. He was sent to the Saumur Cavalry School. In 1926 de Castries was commissioned as a cavalry officer but later resigned to devote himself to equestrian sports. After rejoining the army at the start of World War II, he was captured (1940), escaped from a German prison-of-war camp (1941), and fought with the Allied forces in North Africa, Italy, the south of France and finally, during the invasion of Southern Germany. He ended the war in command of the 3rd Moroccan Spahis (mechanized cavalry), whose distinctive red cap he was subsequently to wear throughout his service in Indochina. In 1946 de Castries, soon to become a lieutenant colonel, was sent to Indochina where he commanded a tabor (battalion) of Moroccan goumiers. He was wounded and spent a year recuperating in France before returning to Vietnam as a full colonel. In December 1953 he was charged with defending Dien Bien Phu against the Viet Minh. After an eight-week siege, the garrison was defeated, and near the end de Castries was promoted to brigadier general. The French were overrun by the Viet Minh forces on 7 May 1954, effectively ending the First Indochina War and the French presence in Southeast Asia. He was held prisoner for four months while an armistice agreement was reached in Geneva. Upon his return to France de Castries was appointed to command the 5th Armoured Division, then stationed in West Germany. Following a car accident in 1959 he retired from the military.Martin Windrow, 'The Last Valley: Dien Bien Phu and the French Defeat in Vietnam' Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 2004 He subsequently headed a recycling firm.

Labeled the \\"Evil Master of Odors,\\" Stinkor is essentially a humanoid skunk whose superpower is the ability to release a toxic odor from his body that renders foes immobile. Conception1985= Stinkor was first introduced in 1985 as an action figure from the He-Man and the Masters of the Universe toyline and came packaged with a mini-comic entitled The Stench of Evil!. The Stinkor action figure had a semi-foul scent, giving it the distinction of being one of the few toys whose \\"action feature\\" was an odor. The Stinkor action figure was created by Mattel by re-using the mold of another villain in the Masters of the Universe line Mer-Man. The only differences between the Mer-Man and Stinkor action figures were that Stinkor was painted black and white, had different chest armor and was chemically treated with patchouli oil to smell musky. Stinkor was presented to Lou Scheimer and other staff at Filmation for inclusion in the original Masters of the Universe cartoon series, but his questionable superpower kept him from ever making an appearance on television. According to Filmation staff, when the description of Stinkor was read out at a meeting of the story editors, all of them burst out laughing and vowed never to use Stinkor in any episode script. =2002= In the 2002 version of the He-Man cartoon, Stinkor's origin was finally revealed, marking the first time the character had appeared on television. Stinkor was originally a common thief named Odiphus and resembled a large house cat or mogwai. Odiphus was first seen witnessing the escape of Kobra Khan. Later on, Odiphus sought to join Skeletor's group. A chemical accident in Tri-Klops' lab mutated Odiphus into Stinkor and gave him his horrible stench. Stinkor is not immune to his own stench and must wear an oxygen mask to breathe properly. Stinkor eventually incorporated into his breathing apparatus a way to control his stench into focused blasts and teamed up with Skeletor against He-Man and the other Masters of the Universe. As it turns out as difficult as Stinkor is to be around, Skeletor eventually holds him in relatively high favor as a minion who has proved himself agreeably useful. In the show's second season, the episode \\"Out of the Past\\" revealed further background to Stinkor's character. In a flashback sequence we saw Odiphus as a young boy, and it was revealed he was from a race of creatures called the Pelezeans who populate a small village called Pelezea. Odiphus had desired to be a criminal ever since his childhood and as a child betrayed his people by telling the invading warlord Prahvus where the Pelezean kept their weapons. This did get Odiphus punished after a disguised Sorceress of Castle Grayskull repelled Prahvus' forces. In the present, Stinkor suggested to Skeletor to send his skeleton warriors to Pelezea.

The station, and all trains serving it, are operated by Northern Trains and it is situated southeast of Liverpool Lime Street on the main line to Runcorn and Crewe. History The station opened on 2 January 1939. Allerton station was to the south, but it closed in 2005 to make way for Liverpool South Parkway which opened the following year. Facilities There are four platforms, two of which, platforms 1 and 2, are located on the fast lines and are where most trains stop. Platforms 3 and 4 are on the slow lines and are used infrequently, mainly where faster services are booked to overtake stopping services on this stretch of line (This is most common in the Liverpool-bound direction). The platform layout consists of three structures: * Platform 1 - single faced, on the Up Fast line. * Platform 2-3 - double faced, between the Down Fast line & Up Slow lines. * Platform 4 - single faced, on the Down Slow line. All platforms have a basic glass and metal shelter approximately halfway along; the central island platform (2-3) is fully enclosed, whereas the outer platforms have single sided ones. Help points are provided for emergency use and for train running information (there is also a P.A system in place to provide automated service announcements). The station building on the over bridge has a staffed booking office that is open during hours when trains are serving the station, this is operated by Northern Trains though sponsored by Merseytravel. There is no step-free access to the platforms, as the footbridge from the ticket office to platform level has stairs.West Allerton station facilities National Rail Enquiries; Retrieved 11 January 2017 Services Services are roughly half-hourly in each direction, towards Mossley Hill and Liverpool Lime Street to the west and towards Liverpool South Parkway and Manchester Oxford Road in the east.

Situated inside the Palazzo Querini Stampalia, in the sestiere of Castello, on the left bank of the Grand Canal, it includes famous paintings as a self- portrait and Adam and Eve by Palma Giovane, a Sacra Conversazione by Palma Vecchio and a Madonna and Child by Bernardo Strozzi. It also holds prized drawings by Giovanni Bellini, Raphael, Paolo Veronese, Titian, and Tintoretto. The picture gallery is displayed within twenty rooms on the second floor of the palace which also contains furniture, a large public library, porcelains and musical instruments, along with works by artists ranging from the 14th-18th century. History The palazzo was renovated from its original state before the 1960s. From 1961‚Äì1963, Carlo Scarpa restored parts of the building, while changing others. Scarpa created a series of islands, and allowed the water to come into the lobby space. He also restored the idea of a courtyard garden behind the building, with an abstracted rill fountain. Later additions (1993‚Äì2003) are by Mario Botta. The palace also houses the Fondazione Querini Stampalia, which sponsors a prominent library and contemporary art expositions.

A boom vang (US) or kicking strap (UK) is a line or piston system on a sailboat used to exert downward force on the boom and thus control the shape of the sail. The Collins English Dictionary defines it as \\"A rope or tackle extended from the boom of a fore-and-aft mainsail to a deck fitting of a vessel when running, in order to keep the boom from riding up\\".vang. Collins English Dictionary - Complete & Unabridged 11th Edition. HarperCollins Publishers. http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/vang (accessed: July 20, 2012). The vang typically runs from the base of the mast to a point about a third of the way out the boom. Due to the great force necessary to change the height of the boom while a boat is under sail, a line-based boom vang usually includes some sort of a pulley system. Hydraulic piston vangs are used on larger sailboats and controlled by manual or electric hydraulic pumps. The term kicking strap is normally shortened to \\"kicker\\" whilst sailing, e.g. \\"Hard on the kicker when we get to the leeward mark\\". On some sailing boats, such as the 49er, rather than a set of lines pulling the boom downwards, a rigid member is used to push the boom down. By controlling leech tension, the boom vang is one of the three methods of controlling sail twist. On small sailboats and some cruising sailboats a vang may be omitted. If a vang is not installed, then the sheet has to try to control both horizontal and vertical angles of the boom. When the boom is near the centerline, the sheet is nearly vertical, and can exert downward force on the boom. As the sheet is loosened to increase the horizontal angle of the boom and sail, the sheet becomes horizontal and exerts less downward force. A vang works with the sheet to apply the downward force on the boom at all horizontal angles, allowing the sheet to be used to control the horizontal angle of the boom effectively. While under sail, the opposite force to the vang is supplied by the sail itself. When the sail is furled, a topping lift supplies the upward force on the boom. Some line vang systems incorporate a piston to provide the topping lift force and to damp oscillations. Hydraulic vangs can inherently act in the topping lift role. A gnav (the word vang spelt backwards) is an inverted vang. It is a rigid strut that extends obliquely upward from the boom to the mast, exerting a force that pushes down on the boom. As the fixing point of the gnav on the boom is hauled inwards towards the mast, the downward force on the boom increases. A gnav offers more uncluttered space beneath the boom when compared to a vang.

It was finished in 1895, and was Milwaukee's tallest building until completion of the First Wisconsin Center in 1973. In 1973 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Design Interior atrium of City Hall Milwaukee City Hall was designed by architect Henry C. Koch in the Flemish Renaissance Revival style, based on both German precedent (for example, the Hamburg Rathaus or city hall), and local examples (the Pabst Building, demolished in 1981). Due to Milwaukee's historic German immigrant population, many of the surrounding buildings mirror this design. The foundation consists of 2,584 white pine piles that were driven into the marshy land surrounding the Milwaukee River. From that base, the main block of the building rises eight stories, with the massive tower at the end rising to 350 feet, with its clock faces flanked by four \\"beer stein\\" turrets, and topped by a copper-clad spire. With The upper part of the tower was rebuilt after a fire in October 1929.A brief history of City Hall The bell in City Hall was named after Solomon Juneau, Milwaukee's first mayor. It was designed and crafted by the Campbells, who were early pioneers in creating diving chambers and suits near the Great Lakes area during that time. History City Hall was the marketing symbol of Milwaukee until the completion of the Calatrava wing of the Milwaukee Art Museum in 2001, but the bell tower continues to be used as a municipal icon and in some traffic and parking signs. Formerly the tower's front three sides were secondarily used as a lighted marquee, using three tiers of letters with various messages to welcome visitors, conventions and events, along with featuring messages timed to a holiday or achievement. An image of the City Hall marquee containing Welcome Milwaukee Visitors was one of the iconic images of the opening sequence for locally-set sitcom, Laverne & Shirley. The marquee was removed in 1988, and its letters were donated to the Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design in 2012. From 2006 to 2008, the entire building was renovated, including a complete dis-assembly and reassembly of the bell tower, by J. P. Cullen & Sons, Inc., a construction manager and general contractor headquartered in Janesville, Wisconsin. Before the restoration began, the bell was rung rarely because of seismic concerns, and in the last few years an assembly of scaffolds with protective coverings had been in place around the building to protect pedestrians from falling stone and brickwork. The quality of the restoration was the subject of a lawsuit filed by the city of Milwaukee in 2012 against various parties involved in the work. City Hall was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, and declared a National Historic Landmark in 2005.

The station is operated by Northern Trains. History It and Allerton were the only stations opened on 15 February 1864 when the St Helens Railway's (taken over by the London & North Western Railway from 29 July 1864) extension from Speke to Edge Hill opened. The station was replaced from 13 July 1891, when the Edge Hill to Speke line was quadrupled.Railway Magazine March 1959 p. 195 The station was renamed from Mossley Hill for Aigburth to Mossley Hill on 6 May 1974. North of the station, on the route towards Edge Hill are the sites - still identifiable where the line crosses roads - of the former Sefton Park and Wavertree stations. Facilities The ticket office is on a road bridge and (as is standard practice for Merseytravel-sponsored stations) is staffed throughout the hours of service all week, with additional ticket machines on the platforms. Ramps lead down to the two island platforms, which have basic shelters and seats.Mossley Hill station facilities National Rail Enquiries Passenger information screens, automated announcements and customer help points are also provided to offer train running information. Like West Allerton (preceding south) there are 4 platforms, 2 of which, platforms 1 and 2, are located on the fast lines and are where most trains stop. 3 & 4 are on the slow lines and are used infrequently, mainly where faster services operated by Avanti West Coast, TransPennine Express and West Midlands Trains, are booked to overtake stopping services on this stretch of line (this is most common in the Liverpool-bound direction).

This team won 4 County Championships, 3 Regional Championships and 2 OFSAA Championships during this time, making them the most decorated Rugby program in Waterloo Region. These records still stand today. Athletics Waterloo-Oxford is most notable for its Rugby teams. The Senior Boys Rugby team has won twelve WCSSAA Championships, including the 2015 title. In addition, the Junior Boys have won nine WCSSAA titles, including the 2013 title and the girls Rugby team has eight WCSSAA titles. Also, the Girls Basketball teams have had a great run since 2011, winning both a Senior and Junior WCSSAA title and appearing in two CWOSSAA championship games and losing this year's WCSSAA title after going undefeated through the regular season. Other sports that have had moments of strength include boys Volleyball, girls Field Hockey and more recently, Girls Slow Pitch.

It consists of the Audubon Zoo, Aquarium of the Americas, Audubon Louisiana Nature Center, Audubon Park, Woldenberg Riverfront Park, Freeport-McMoRan Audubon Species Survival Center, Entergy IMAX Theatre, Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species (ACRES), Audubon Wilderness Park, and the Audubon Insectarium. History1800s= The Audubon family of nature sites and facilities began with Audubon Park - once home to Native Americans - and later, to New Orleans' first mayor, √âtienne de Bor√©. He founded the nation's first commercial sugar plantation here, when New Orleans was still part of Spanish colonial Louisiana; and developed its first granulated sugar through a process invented by Norbert Rillieux, a local free man of color. The land did not fall into public hands until 1850, when a philanthropist willed it to the city. During the US Civil War, the location alternately hosted a Confederate military camp and a Union hospital. In 1866, it was the activation site for the 9th Cavalry Regiment, the \\"Buffalo Soldiers,\\" whose defense of the United States' western frontier made an indelible mark on America's African-American heritage. Site improvements made for the World's Industrial and Cotton Centennial Exposition of 1884 (Louisiana's first World's Fair) laid the foundation for an urban park. The city had designated the land for this purpose in 1871; and in 1886, city planners changed the park's name from Upper City Park to Audubon Park. This was in tribute to artist/naturalist John James Audubon who painted many of his famed Birds of America in Louisiana. A governing board was appointed by the city in 1894 to find the best way to develop the land; and by the turn of the century, development had been entrusted to landscape architect John Charles Olmsted. Olmsted's family firm had risen to prominence for its design of New York City's Central Park, and New Orleanians soon watched their own scenic retreat materialize from Louisiana swamp land. =1900s: from decline to revitalization= The Audubon Commission was established by State Act in 1914 to maintain and develop Audubon Park. A flight cage was added to the park in 1916, and its popularity launched the community's call for a full-scale zoo. Community leaders united as the New Orleans Zoological Society, and (in a tradition carried on today) private donations soon funded a monkey cage, a mammal cage and a deer paddock. The first elephant, purchased by Louisiana schoolchildren, arrived in 1924. An aquarium and a colonnaded sea lion pool fueled the momentum, and by 1929, the collection boasted hundreds of animals. When the Depression of the 1930s shut down private donations, the city's hope for a zoo was kept alive by the Works Progress Administration (WPA). This federal agency funded construction of new zoo buildings, and in 1938, a $50,000 bequest from local benefactor Valentine Merz enabled the opening of the Merz Memorial Zoo. Expensive to maintain and operate, the Merz facility held its own until the 1950s. Deterioration followed as city appropriations dwindled, private donations dried up and public interest waned. There were a few bright moments (including the 1956 arrival of the first endangered whooping crane hatched in a zoo), but times were mostly bad. Blasted by the media as an animal \\"ghetto\\" in 1958 and urged to \\"clean up or close up\\" by the Humane Society of the United States in 1970, the Zoo‚Äînow called Audubon Zoo‚Äîbegged recovery. Recovery finally came through the efforts of devoted community volunteers, and a remarkable public/private collaboration through the Audubon Commission. In 1972 the Commission spearheaded passage of a special referendum which generated nearly $2 million in bonds to finance the beginning of the Zoo's restoration. The volunteers formally rallied as Friends of the Zoo, and in 1973, Ron Forman‚Äîthe City Hall Liaison for Audubon Park‚Äîcame on board with a grand vision that evolved into a new master plan for the Zoo. Forman and the Audubon Commission expanded the Zoo to its current 58 acres, allowing for sweeping natural habitats that mirrored wild environments: the African Savanna, North American Grasslands and the South American Pampas. Other new adventures included a Children's Zoo and a World of Primates exhibit. Audubon Zoo's Phoenix-like rise led to accreditation from the American Zoo and Aquarium Association in 1981. Industry peers were further impressed by the 1984 debut of the Louisiana Swamp Exhibit. Its unprecedented exhibit style not only displayed native animals in a stunningly realistic environment, it used cultural elements to capture the lifestyle of the Cajun people who have endeared Louisiana's swamplands to the world. Audubon's incredible turnaround set a new benchmark for zoo exhibits‚Äîand New Orleans success stories. Most importantly, the Zoo's rebirth firmly anchored Audubon among the nation's top-rated zoological parks and inspired support for future developments that would benefit the city culturally‚Äîand economically. By the mid-1980s, Audubon was lobbying for an exciting new educational resource that would highlight aquatic habitats while reintroducing New Orleanians to their own, legendary Mississippi River. Where decaying warehouses blocked public access to the river's banks, Ron Forman, his team, and their supporters envisioned a lush community park with a sparkling centerpiece: Audubon Aquarium of the Americas. Vision became reality as local citizens overwhelming approved a millage to service $25 million in bonds to fund construction of the Aquarium and Woldenberg Riverfront Park. The project not only set a new, broader course for Audubon. It promised the city a much-needed family attraction that could drive its tourism industry to new heights. Woldenberg Park opened in 1989, the same year the Friends of the Zoo evolved into Audubon Nature Institute. The Aquarium followed in 1990, drawing huge crowds for its Labor Day opening. Four months later, the facility had already exceeded its first-year attendance projections. And Audubon Nature Institute was ready, once again, to leverage its success for new achievements. =2000s: focus on conservation= In the next decade, Audubon Nature Institute adopted an ambitious new mission incorporating wildlife conservation, science education, and family entertainment. New ways to captivate and educate visitors emerged. The Aquarium expanded into a new wing housing Entergy IMAX¬Æ Theatre and a Changing Exhibits Gallery, while Woldenberg Park also extended its borders. The Zoo 2000 master plan saw completion through the addition of the CNG (now Dominion) Learning Center; engaging new exhibits (e.g. Komodo dragons and Jaguar Jungle); the state-of-the-art Columbia Animal Healthcare Center; and a grand new entrance befitting a world-class zoo. Audubon Louisiana Nature Center joined the growing family in a 1994 merger and later developed new educational programs for Audubon Wilderness Park, a private West Bank preserve which would welcome schoolchildren and other scheduled groups to discover native animals and habitats. Through each new development, the family birthplace‚ÄîAudubon Park‚Äîhas endured as a much-loved community resource that combines habitat preservation with human pastimes. The extensive 2002 renovation of its historic Golf Course shaped beautiful new vistas enjoyed by all park users who, like generations before them, embrace the site as a center of New Orleans life. Innovation remained a guiding force as Audubon Nature Institute sought to grow its commitment to wildlife conservation‚Äîon a global scale. With successful breeding programs already in place at the Zoo and the Aquarium, Audubon addressed the critical need for additional population management space with the 1993 opening of Freeport-McMoRan Audubon Species Survival Center. Unique in the world, the campus combines research laboratories with acres of pristine natural habitat where rare and endangered animals can roam and reproduce. Exotic wildcats, Mississippi sandhill cranes, whooping cranes, saddlebill storks, and other vanishing animals find sanctuary and flourish on these grounds, while scientists on-site at Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species wield assisted reproduction technologies in the war against wildlife extinction. Employing vital partnerships with universities, government agencies and other conservation-dedicated organizations, the Research Center team continues to earn international renown through amazing achievements. These include the world's first African wildcat clones;See: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4172688.stm the first caracal cat created from a frozen-thawed embryo; the first African serval wildcat born as a result of in vitro fertilization; and a \\"Frozen Zoo,\\" which preserves the genetic material of hundreds of diminishing animal species‚Äîensuring their survival in the future. Audubon Nature Institute added an exciting new branch to the family tree on June 13, 2008‚ÄîAudubon Butterfly Garden and Insectarium. Located in the historic U.S. Custom House in downtown New Orleans, the Butterfly Garden and Insectarium was the first major new attraction to open in the city since Hurricane Katrina. The Butterfly Garden and Insectarium celebrates the world of bugs with 13 gallery rooms containing more than 70 live animal enclosures, 30 mounted specimen cases and a multi- sensory immersive theater experience. There are about 100 live arthropod species throughout as well as a variety of fish. Visitors can experience live insect encounters, discover cultural aspects of insects, sample exotic insect cuisine, shrink in size to see the world from a bug's perspective, and enjoy the tranquility of a Japanese garden while watching hundreds of butterflies flit about. This one-of-a-kind interactive experience is another \\"living classroom\\" designed to show how human lives are affected by nature‚Äîand what we all stand to lose without careful stewardship of its every, treasured resource. Public outreach and impact Constantly attuned to local needs, Audubon Nature Institute shapes its myriad programs to benefit our community at all levels, from providing much-needed educational resources to nurturing economic development. Audubon educators collaborate with public school teachers and administrators to help fill a science education void created by funding shortfalls. Afterschool programs, teacher training sessions, field trip enrichment programs and family learning opportunities are staged at all of Audubon's public facilities, including the Zoo's Jeri and Robert Nims Community Center. Outreach vehicles, learning kits, and other initiatives extend Audubon's teaching arm directly into area classrooms‚Äîprograms like the Internet-based WILD-LAB curriculum or Coast to Classroom widen that reach still more. Ensuring that all community members enjoy access to Audubon Nature Institute is an ongoing priority achieved through summer discounts made available to students in financially disadvantaged schools; minority hiring initiatives; vendor policies that ensure opportunities for Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (EDB); and celebration of the city's great cultural diversity through such Audubon-hosted events as Soul Fest, Black History Month activities and the Asian Pacific-American Festival. The Audubon Nature Institute continues to play a vital role in the local economy as well. With more than $250 million in capital investments, a $40 million annual budget, a workforce of more than 600 employees, and the generation of $19 million in local and state sales taxes each year, Audubon has an annual economic impact of $330 million. This is an amazing return on investments made in the Audubon vision by generations of supporters‚Äîand a remarkable accomplishment for an organization that, unlike its peers, receives little or no city or state funding for day-to-day operations. Effects of Hurricane Katrina The 2005 Hurricane Katrina caused substantial physical destruction, wiped out all Audubon operating revenues and forced the layoff of nearly 600 employees. Nonetheless, Aquarium staff remained at their posts throughout the storm, as well as the subsequent flooding, doing what they could for the animals in their charge.

Never having played in higher than Segunda Divisi√≥n in his own country ‚Äì with the exception of one game for Barcelona ‚Äì he would spend seven years of his career playing in England (two seasons) and Scotland (five), representing a total of four clubs. Club careerBarcelona= Born in Barcelona, Catalonia, Juanjo was a youth product at La Liga giants FC Barcelona. During the three years he spent with the team as a senior, however, he only appeared once for the main squad, against Deportivo de La Coru√±a at the Riazor Stadium (ten minutes played in an eventual 2‚Äì2 draw). =Scotland / England= In 1998, Juanjo moved to Edinburgh to play for Heart of Midlothian, where he received his first taste of Scottish football. His spell at the club was very successful, as he amassed official totals of 85 games and 11 goals during his three-year stint. Juanjo later followed manager Jim Jefferies to England and Bradford City in the second division. He scored on his debut appearance for his new team, against Walsall. After one and a half seasons, he returned to his country and signed with Real Ja√©n in Segunda Divisi√≥n B. John Robertson, manager of Inverness Caledonian Thistle, offered Juanjo a return to Scotland in the summer of 2004. He was one of the most influential players in the Caley Jags' first-ever season in the Scottish Premier League, scoring and assisting alike as they finished eighth. A ruptured achilles tendon injury kept Juanjo from participating in Inverness's games in the early part of the following campaign. When he returned to fitness, he found himself falling out of favour with player-coach Craig Brewster and, during the following January transfer window, the player was allowed to move to Hamilton Academical on loan for the rest of the season. He scored two goals for the team, in the Scottish Cup against Dundee F.C. and in the league against Brechin City. =Later years= Aged 29, Juanjo left Inverness and Scotland, joining another side in his country's third level, Granada CF. In the following two years he played amateur football with as many teams, in his native region. In July 2008, Juanjo was an unnamed trialist for Airdrie United in a pre-season testimonial against Blackburn United, in honour of captain Craig Spence's ten years at the junior side. In January of the following year, he briefly returned to England, being handed a trial with League Two side Bournemouth following recommendation from former club midfielder Claus Bech J√∏rgensen, his former teammate at Bradford; however, nothing came of it. In late August 2009, Juanjo signed with Gibraltar United FC, leaving after one season at the age of 33 and resuming his career in Cyprus and in the Spanish lower leagues.

After the movie opened in theaters Hurac√°n Ram√≠rez also became a professional wrestling character in the ring, primarily played by luchador Eduardo Bonada, who was soon after replaced in the mid-1950s by wrestler Daniel Garc√≠a Arteaga who wrestled under that name for more than thirty years. The rights to the name and image of Hurac√°n Ram√≠rez were never owned by Garc√≠a, which has led to a number of other wrestlers using the name \\"Hurac√°n Ram√≠rez\\" after Garcia retired in 1988, or variations on the theme such as Hurac√°n Ram√≠rez II, Hurac√°n Ram√≠rez Jr., el Hijo de Hurac√°n Ram√≠rez (\\"Son of Hurac√°n Ram√≠rez\\") and so on, but all of whom had no atual family relationship to Daniel Garc√≠a. Movie Character Hurac√°n Ram√≠rez was originally just the title character of a 1952 Mexican film called \\"Hurac√°n Ram√≠rez\\" that starred actor David Silva as a masked professional wrestler or luchador enmascarado character he names Huracan Ramirez. In the film, a young Mexican, whose father is an aging professional wrestler, decides to follow in his father's footsteps by adopting the secret identity of \\"Hurac√°n Ram√≠rez\\", a masked luchador, and he fights in the ring in spite of his father's wishes to the contrary. While David Silva played the part of Huracan's unmasked alter ego Fernando Torres, the wrestling sequences were performed by an actual luchador named Eduardo Bonada, who then went on for a few years to play the role in real life, in the ring. In the mid-1950s, Bonada tired of the role, preferring not to cover his face with a mask, and quit the gig, at which time he was replaced by the film's producers with another wrestler named David Garcia Arteaga, who played the role in the ring for about 30 years, until he retired in 1988. The Huracan Ramirez name came from combining a natural disaster with a strong Spanish last name to appeal to the Mexican crowd. Initially he was named \\"Hurac√°n L√≥pez\\", but it was later changed to Hurac√°n Ram√≠rez to avoid confusion with Tarz√°n L√≥pez, one of the top Mexican Luchadors at the time. A sequel, El misterio de Hurac√°n Ram√≠rez (\\"The Mystery of Hurricane Ramirez\\") came out in 1962 and again featured leading man David Silva reprising his role, but the wrestling sequences this time were all played by the new Huracan, Daniel Garc√≠a, who had played the character in the ring ever since Eduardo Bonada had quit the gig. David Silva played the unmasked Huracan in the first 4 films, to be replaced by actor Pepe Romay in the last few films. Bonada's and Garcia's faces were never shown in any of the films they appeared in, as they only played the masked scenes in the films. The Hurac√°n character is the property of filmmaker Juan Rodr√≠guez Mas and his father, Jos√© Rodr√≠guez (the director of the first Hurac√°n film), who allowed first Eduardo Bonada, and later Daniel Garc√≠a, to play the character in the ring up until each man retired. In 1989, following Garc√≠a's retirement from the ring, Rodr√≠guez wanted to give the mask and character to a new younger wrestler, tying the transfer in with a new Hurac√°n Ram√≠rez movie he was promoting. Garc√≠a resented the idea that someone else would cash in on the popularity he gained while wrestling. In 1988, after the producers refused to share the profits from a then-flourishing Huracan comic book with Garcia, Garcia spitefully unmasked on television and at several fan events, messing up Rodr√≠guez Mas' plans and the character in general. The Hurac√°n Ram√≠rez film, Huracan Ramirez vs the Terrorists, was released in 1989 but did not do well. =Filmography= A total of 9 \\"Hurac√°n Ram√≠rez\\" movies were made in all, the 7th, 8th and 9th films being more or less unrelated. Unlike the Santo movies, these films tended to focus more on dramatic subplots and musical numbers, and never really gave the Hurac√°n Ram√≠rez character a lot to do in the films from an action standpoint. Eduardo Bonada played Huracan in the first movie only, then David Garc√≠a Arteaga played the part of Huracan in the next five movies (from 1962-1974), his last real appearance being De Sangre Chicana (1974), although he continued to wrestle as Huracan in the ring until 1988. Garcia said that he did not wear the mask for the 2 later \\"Torito\\" movies (in 1979 and 1982 respectively), films featuring a wrestler called Torito which only featured very brief scenes of Huracan, nor did he appear in the 1989 movie. *Hurac√°n Ram√≠rez (Hurricane Ramirez) (1952) starring Eduardo Bonada in the masked action scenes *El misterio de Hurac√°n Ram√≠rez (\\"The Mystery of Hurricane Ramirez\\") (1962) David Garcia's first turn at playing the masked action scenes *El Hijo de Hurac√°n Ram√≠rez (\\"The Son of Hurricane Ramirez\\") (1966) w.

The person playing Huracan Jr. was not related to any of the wrestlers who played Huracan Ramirez in the original movies. Wrestling character The original \\"Hurac√°n Ram√≠rez\\", Eduardo Bonada, adopted the mask and ring name as an actual professional wrestler after he played the masked wrestling scenes in the original 1952 film, with the approval of the film's director Jos√© Rodr√≠guez, who agreed that a \\"real life Hurac√°n Ram√≠rez\\" would be a good way to ensure the success of his movie. Bonada did not enjoy wrestling under a mask, as it hid his good looks and prevented his recognizability. At one point he spitefully unmasked in public and revealed that he had been playing \\"Hurac√°n Ram√≠rez\\" in the ring but was now moving on to other projects. After Bonada gave up the character in the mid-50s, a number of wrestlers started wrestling as \\"Hurac√°n Ram√≠rez\\" all over Mexico, but the local boxing and wrestling commissions who regulate professional wrestling in Mexico objected to the deception. The movie's producers held a tryout to see who would be the \\"one true\\" Hurac√°n Ram√≠rez in the wrestling world. They chose Daniel Garc√≠a to play the part, but never publicly revealed who had taken over the mask both in their ensuing films as well as in the ring. Later in the year Garcia made his official Mexico City debut in a match against El Medico Asesino. Taking over the gig from Bonada, Garc√≠a wrestled as \\"Hurac√°n Ram√≠rez\\" for more than thirty years, becoming one of the most popular wrestlers in Mexico as well as in other Spanish-speaking countries such as Bolivia and Ecuador. In the mid-1980s, Garc√≠a wanted to ensure that the \\"Hurac√°n Ram√≠rez\\" character was passed on to another generation, much in the same tradition of Santo passing his name on to El Hijo del Santo and Blue Demon's legacy being continued by Blue Demon, Jr.. This desire, and issues over sharing the profits from the \\"Hurac√°n Ram√≠rez\\" comic book and merchandising led to a falling out between Garc√≠a and Rodr√≠guez Mas, which led to Mas threatening to take the \\"Ram√≠rez\\" character away from Garc√≠a altogether. Following the threat, Garc√≠a voluntarily unmasked on national television, ensuring that everyone knew who the true \\"Hurac√°n\\" had been for the past 30 years. The move did prevent any subsequent wrestlers working as \\"Hurac√°n Ram√≠rez\\" from gaining anywhere near Garcia's popularity. In subsequent years, several wrestlers have however used similar ring names such as Hurac√°n Ram√≠rez II, Hurac√°n Ram√≠rez, Jr., el Hijo de Hurac√°n Ram√≠rez and variations thereof, (or names inspired by Ram√≠rez such as \\"Cicl√≥n Ram√≠rez\\"). Hurac√°n Ram√≠rez in pop culture The \\"Hurac√°n Ram√≠rez\\" character has been used or included in a number of different non-Lucha Libre contexts. Replicas of his mask has been for sale through a number venues, including such non- wrestling venues as Amazon.com and Halloween stores. The distinctive blue and white mask has also been included as an option in the Create a Wrestler (CAW) option of a number of pro wrestling video games such as WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009.

(However, the phrase is also used in a more generic sense by companies such as Evans and Sutherland to refer to their fulldome projection technology products.) Description Digital theatre is primarily identified by the coexistence of ‚Äúlive‚Äù performers and digital media in the same unbroken(1) space with a co-present audience. In addition to the necessity that its performance must be simultaneously ‚Äúlive‚Äù and digital, the event‚Äôs secondary characteristics are that its content should retain some recognizable theatre roles (through limiting the level of interactivity) and a narrative element of spoken language or text. The four conditions of digital theatre are: #It is a ‚Äúlive‚Äù performance placing at least some performers in the same shared physical space with an audience.(2) #The performance must use digital technology as an essential part of the primary artistic event.(3) #The performance contains only limited levels of interactivity,(4) in that its content is shaped primarily by the artist(s) for an audience.(5) #The performance‚Äôs content should contain either spoken language or text which might constitute a narrative or story, differentiating it from other events which are distinctly dance, art, or music. ‚ÄùLive,‚Äù digital media, interactivity, and narrative A brief clarification of these terms in relation to digital theatre is in order. The significance of the terms ‚Äúlive‚Äù or ‚Äúliveness‚Äù as they occur in theatre can not be over-emphasized, as it is set in opposition to digital in order to indicate the presence of both types of communication, human and computer-created. Rather than considering the real-time or temporality of events, digital theatre concerns the interactions of people (audience and actors) sharing the same physical space (in at least one location, if multiple audiences exist). In the case of mass broadcast, it is essential that this sharing of public space occurs at the site of the primary artistic event.(6) The next necessary condition for creating digital theatre is the presence of digital media in the performance. Digital media is not defined through the presence of one type of technology hardware or software configuration, but by its characteristics of being flexible, mutable, easily adapted, and able to be processed in real-time. It is the ability to change not only sound and light, but also images, video, animation, and other content into triggered, manipulated, and reconstituted data which is relayed or transmitted in relation to other impulses which defines the essential nature of the digital format. Digital information has the quality of pure computational potential, which can be seen as parallel to the potential of human imagination. The remaining characteristics of limited interactivity and narrative or spoken word are secondary and less distinct parameters. While interactivity can apply to both the interaction between humans and machines and between humans, digital theatre is primarily concerned with the levels of interactivity occurring between audience and performers (as it is facilitated through technology).(7) It is in this type of interactivity, similar to other types of heightened audience participation,(8) that the roles of message sender and receiver can dissolve to that of equal conversers, causing theatre to dissipate into conversation. The term ‚Äúinteractive‚Äù refers to any mutually or reciprocally active communication, whether it be a human-human or a human- machine communication. The criteria of having narrative content through spoken language or text as part of the theatrical event is meant not to limit the range of what is already considered standard theatre (as there are examples in the works of Samuel Beckett in which the limits of verbal expression are tested), but to differentiate between that which is digital theatre and the currently more developed fields of digital dance9 and Art Technology.(10) This is necessary because of the mutability between art forms utilizing technology. It is also meant to suggest a wide range of works including dance theatre involving technology and spoken words such as Troika Ranch‚Äôs The Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz (Troika Ranch, 2000), to the creation of original text-based works online by performers like the Plain Text Players or collaborations such as Art Grid‚Äôs Interplay: Hallucinations, to pre-scripted works such as the classics (A Midsummer Night‚Äôs Dream, The Tempest) staged with technology at the University of Kansas and the University of Georgia. The Participatory Virtual Theatre efforts at the Rochester Institute of Technology take a different approach by have live actors use motion capture to control avatars on a virtual stage. Audience responses are designed into the software that supports the performance. In the 2004 production, \\"What's the Buzz?\\" (17), a single node motion capture device controlled the performance of a swarm of bees. Later performances use two motion capture systems located in different buildings controlling the performance on a single virtual stage (18). These criteria or limiting parameters are flexible enough to allow for a wide range of theatrical activities while refining the scope of events to those which most resemble the hybrid ‚Äúlive‚Äù/mediated form of theatre described as digital theatre. digital theatre is separated from the larger category of digital performance (as expressed in the overabundance of a variety of items including installations, dance concerts, Compact discs, robot fights and other events found in the Digital Performance Archive). History In the early 1980s, video, satellites, fax machines, and other communications equipment began to be used as methods of creating art and performance. The groups Fluxus and John Cage were among the early leaders in expanding what was considered art, technology, and performance. With the adaptation of personal computers in the 1980s, new possibilities for creating performance communications was born. Artists like Sherrie Rabinowitz and Kit Galloway began to transition from earlier, more costly experiments with satellite transmission to experiments with the developing internet. Online communities such as The Well and interactive writing offered new models for artistic creativity. With the ‚ÄòDot Com‚Äô boom of the 1990s, telematic artists including Roy Ascott began to develop greater significance as theatre groups like George Coates Performance Works and Gertrude Stein Repertory Theatre established partnerships with software and hardware companies encouraged by the technology boom. In Australia in the early 1990s Julie Martin's Virtual Reality Theatre presented works at the Sydney Opera House, featuring the first hybrid human digital avatars, in 1996 \\"A Midsummer Nights Dream featured Augmented Reality Stage sets designed and produced by her company. Researchers such as Claudio Pinanhez at MIT, David Saltz of The Interactive Performance Laboratory at the University of Georgia, and Mark Reaney head of the Virtual Reality Theatre Lab at the University of Kansas, as well as significant dance technology partnerships (including Riverbed and Riverbed‚Äôs work with Merce Cunningham) led to an unprecedented expansion in the use of digital technology in creating media-rich performances (including the use of motion capture, 3D stereoscopic animation, and virtual reality as in The Virtual Theatricality Lab‚Äòs production of The Skriker at Henry Ford Community College under the direction of Dr. George Popovich. Another example is the sense:less project by Stenslie/Mork/Watz/Pendry using virtual actors that users would engage with inside a VR environment. The project was shown at ELECTRA, Henie Onstad Art Center, Norway, DEAF 1996 in Rotterdam and the Fifth Istanbul Biennial (1997). Early use of mechanical and projection devices for theatrical entertainments have a long history tracing back to mechanicals of ancient Greece and medieval magic lanterns. But the most significant precursors of digital theatre can be seen in the works of the early 20th century. It is in the ideas of artists including Edward Gordon Craig, Erwin Piscator (and to a limited degree Bertolt Brecht in their joint work on Epic Theatre), Josef Svoboda, and the Bauhaus and Futurists movements that we can see the strongest connections between today‚Äôs use of digital media and live actors, and earlier, experimental theatrical use of non-human actors, broadcast technology, and filmic projections. The presence of these theatrical progenitors using analog media, such as filmic projection, provides a bridge between Theatre and many of today‚Äôs vast array of computer-art-performance-communication experiments. These past examples of theatre artists integrating their modern technology with theatre strengthens the argument that theatrical entertainment does not have to be either purist involving only ‚Äúlive‚Äù actors on stage, or be consumed by the dominant televisual mass media, but can gain from the strengths of both types of communication. Other terminology Digital theatre does not exist in a vacuum but in relation to other terminology. It is a type of Digital Performance and may accommodate many types of ‚Äúlive‚Äù/mediated theatre including ‚ÄúVR Theatre‚Äù(11) and ‚ÄúComputer Theatre,‚Äù(12) both of which involve specific types of computer media, ‚Äúlive‚Äù performers, story/words, and limited levels of interactivity. However, terms such as ‚ÄúDesktop Theatre,‚Äù(13) using animated computer avatars in online chat-rooms without co-present audiences falls outside digital theatre into the larger category of digital performance. Likewise, digital dance may fall outside the parameters of digital theatre, if it does not contain elements of story or spoken words. \\"Cyberformance\\" can be included within this definition of Digital theatre, where it includes a proximal audience: \\"Cyberformance can be created and presented entirely online, for a distributed online audience who participate via internet- connected computers anywhere in the world, or it can be presented to a proximal audience (such as in a physical theatre or gallery venue) with some or all of the performers appearing via the internet; or it can be a hybrid of the two approaches, with both remote and proximal audiences and/or performers.\\" See also * Digital performance * History of theatre * Stage terminology Notes #Space not divided by visible solid interfaces such as walls, glass screens, or other visible barriers which perceptually divide the audience from the playing space making two (or more) rooms rather than a continuous place including both stage and audience. #It is suggested that a minimal audience of two or more is needed to keep a performance from being a conversation or art piece. If additional online or mediated audiences exist, only one site need have a co-present audience/performer situation. #Digital technology may be used to create, manipulate or influence content. However, the use of technology for transmission or archiving does not constitute a performance of digital theatre. #Interactivity is more than choices on a navigation menu, low levels of participation or getting a desired response to a request. Sheizaf Rafaeli defines it as existing in the relay of a message, in which the third or subsequent message refers back to the first. ‚ÄúFormally stated, interactivity is an expression of the extent that in a given series of communication exchanges, any third (or later) transmission (or message) is related to the degree to which previous exchanges referred to even earlier transmissions‚Äù (Sheizaf Rafaeli, ‚ÄúInteractivity, From New Media to Communication,‚Äù pages 110-34 in Advanced Communicational Science: Merging Mass and Interpersonal Processes, ed. Robert P. Hawkins, John M. Wiemann, and Suzanne Pingree [Newbury Park: Sage Publications, 1988] 111). #Though some of the content may be formed or manipulated by both groups, the flow of information is primarily from message creator or sender to receiver, thus maintaining the roles of author/performer and audience (rather than dissolving those roles into equal participants in a conversation). This also excludes gaming or VR environments in which the (usually isolated) participant is the director of the action which his actions drive. #While TV studio audiences may feel that they are at a public ‚Äúlive‚Äù performance, these performances are often edited and remixed for the benefit of their intended primary audience, the home audiences which are viewing the mass broadcast in private. Broadcasts of ‚ÄúGreat Performances‚Äù by PBS and other theatrical events broadcast into private homes, give the TV viewers the sense that they are secondary viewers of a primary ‚Äúlive‚Äù event. In addition, archival or real-time web-casts which do not generate feedback influencing the ‚Äúlive‚Äù performances are not within the range of digital theatre. In each case, a visible interface such as TV or monitor screen, like a camera frames and interprets the original event for the viewers. #An example of this is the case of internet chat which becomes the main text of be read or physically interpreted by performers on stage. Online input including content and directions can also have an effect of influencing ‚Äúlive‚Äù performance beyond the ability of ‚Äúlive‚Äù co-present audiences. #E.g. happenings. #Such as the stunning visual media dance concerts like Ghostcatching, by Merce Cunningham and Riverbed, accessible online via the revamped/migrated Digital Performance Archive and Merce Cunningham Dance; cf. Isabel C. Valverde, ‚ÄúCatching Ghosts in Ghostcatching: Choreographing Gender and Race in Riverbed/Bill T. Jones‚Äô Virtual Dance,‚Äù accessible in a pdf version from Extensions: The Online Journal of Embodied Teaching. #Such as Telematic Dreaming, by Paul Sermon, in which distant participants shared a bed through mixing projected video streams; see \\"Telematic Dreaming - Statement.\\" #Mark Reaney, head of the Virtual Reality Theatre Lab at the University of Kansas, investigates the use of virtual reality (‚Äúand related technologies‚Äù) in theatre. ‚ÄúVR Theatre‚Äù is one form or subset of digital theatre focusing on utilizing virtual reality immersion in mutual concession with traditional theatre practices (actors, directors, plays, a theatre environment). The group uses image projection and stereoscopic sets as their primary area of digital investigation. #Another example of digital theatre is Computer Theatre, as defined by Claudio S. Pinhanez in his work 'Computer Theatre (in which he also gives the definition of ‚Äúhyper-actor‚Äù as an actor whose expressive capabilities are extended through the use of technologies). ‚ÄúComputer Theatre, in my view, is about providing means to enhance the artistic possibilities and experiences of professional and amateur actors, or of audiences clearly engaged in a representational role in a performance‚Äù (Computer Theater [Cambridge: Perceptual Computing Group -- MIT Media Laboratory, 1996] (forthcoming in a revised ed.); Pinhanez also sees this technology being explored more through dance than theatre. His writing and his productions of I/IT suggest that Computer Theatre is digital theatre. #On the far end of the spectrum, outside of the parameters of digital theatre, are what are called Desktop Theater and Virtual Theatre. These are digital performances or media events which are created and presented on computers utilizing intelligent agents or synthetic characters, called avatars. Often these are interactive computer programs or online conversations. Without human actors, or group audiences, these works are computer multimedia interfaces allowing a user to play at the roles of theatre rather than being theatre. Virtual Theatre is defined by the Virtual Theatre Project at Stanford on their website as a project which ‚Äúaims to provide a multimedia environment in which user can play all of the creative roles associated with producing and performing plays and stories in an improvisational theatre company.‚Äù #For more information, see Multimedia: From Wagner to Virtual Reality, ed. Randall Packer and Ken Jordan; Telepresence and Bio Art, by Eduardo Kac; and Virtual Theatres: An Introduction, by Gabriella Giannachi (London and New York: Routledge, 2004). #Media, in this sense, indicates the broadcast and projection of film, video, images and other content which can, but need not be digitized. These elements are often seen as additions to traditional forms of theatre even before the use of computers to process them. The addition of computers to process visual, aural and other data allows for greater flexibility in translating visual and other information into impulses which can interact with each other and their environments in real-time. Media is also distinguished from mass media, by which primarily means TV broadcast, Film, and other communications resources owned by multi-national media corporations. Mass media is that section of the media specifically conceived and designed to reach a very large audience (typically at least as large as the majority of the population of a nation state). It refers primarily to television, film, internet, and various news/entertainment corporations and their subsidiaries. #Here the use of quotations signals a familiarity with the issues of mediation vs. real-time events as expressed by Phillip Auslander, yet choosing to use the term in its earlier meaning, indicating co-present human audience and actors in the same shared breathing space unrestrained by a physical barrier or perceived interface. This earlier meaning is still in standard use by digital media performers to signify the simultaneous presence of the human and the technological other. It is possible also to use the term (a)live to indicate co-presence. #Geigel, J. and Schweppe, M., What's the Buzz?: A Theatrical Performance in Virtual Space, in Advancing Computing and Information Sciences, Reznik, L., ed., Cary Graphics Arts Press, Rochester, NY, 2005, pp. 109‚Äì116. #Schweppe, M. and Geigel, J., 2009. \\"Teaching Graphics in the Context of Theatre\\", Eurographics 2009 Educators Program (Munich, Germany, March 30-April 1, 2009) External links * ‚Äò‚ÄôDigitalTheatre.Com Direct downloads website.‚Äô‚Äô * ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Search for digital theatre‚Äô‚Äô * Digital Performance Archive hosted by AHDS Performing Arts * Ontology vs. History: Making Distinctions Between the Live and the Mediatized * Merce Cunningham Dance * Catching Ghosts in Ghostcatching * ‚ÄúTelematic Dreaming‚Äù * George Coates Performance Works * Troika Ranch * Another Language Performance Art Company * George Popovich * Studio for Electronic Theatre - Digital performance research and production * eSpectacularKids - Online storytelling, magic shows and theatre for children Category:Theatre Category:Digital art Category:Performing arts ","title":"Digital theatre"},{"id":"2738524","text":"Farben (German: \\"color\\") may refer to: *IG Farben - former German chemical industry conglomerate **IG Farben Building - former corporate headquarters of IG Farben in Frankfurt, Germany **IG Farben Trial - the war crimes trial of 24 IG Farben executives following World War II *Jan Jelinek - German electronic musician, who has performed under the name \\"Farben\\" *Farben Lehre - Polish punk rock band *Third movement of Arnold Schoenberg's Five Pieces for Orchestra ","title":"Farben"},{"id":"2738527","text":"The Leopoldst√§dter Tempel Inside view of the Leopoldst√§dter Tempel.

In the south of the parish the hamlet of Pegsdon includes the Pegsdon hills nature reserve and is a salient of the county into Hertfordshire. Since 1985 its administration has included the village of Higham Gobion, south-west on the minor road leading to the main north‚Äìsouth road in the district, the A6.BLARS, Guide to Bedfordshire Parishes It has a population of 1,831 and is centred midway between stopping services railway stations on the Midland Main Line and East Coast Main Line away. Farmland and hedgerows forms 95% of the land use and to the south and north of the boundaries is intermittent woodland. HistoryEtymology= The village's name evolved through Sethlindone (6th century), Suthlingdon (8th century), Shutlyngdene, Shetelyngton (14th century), and then into an unfortunate Shytlington in official returns and letters of the 17th and 18th centuries. The name was later bowdlerised. =Early history= Miscellaneous Roman artefacts have been found. Shillington is mentioned in the Domesday Book. The entry is headed: \\"Sethlindone: [overlord] St Benedict's of Ramsey. a broken mill, 2 others\\". It contained 34 households, of which four were slaves, however 27 were villagers or villeins, and five were homes of more independent smallholders. Per year it rendered a large ¬£12, assessed by the Book's compilers to be the same at the conquest twenty years before, had 14 ploughlands and woodland for 100 pigs per year.Domesday map website The chief hamlets were: Lower Stondon in the north- east, Pegsdon on high ground south of the village on the hills which form the Hertfordshire border, Aspley ‚Äî with Aspley Bury manor ‚Äî to the south, Little Holwell, to the east, and Woodmer End and Bury End close to the village on the north. =World War II (1939‚Äì1945)= Avro Lancaster In 1940 a Luftwaffe Dornier 17 was attacked over Great Offley (to the south of Pegsdon), the bomber crashed killing the pilot alongside the road at Pegsdon.BBC People's War ‚Äì Brian Limbrick‚Äôs Wartime Childhood 1938 to 1941. website accessed 20/07/10 On 21 February 1944 Lancaster LL729 (A4 B)Lost Bombers (website accessed: 22/07/10)Alex Tooley, recollection. BBC Peoples War website accessed: 20 July 2010) belonging to 115 Squadron RAF left its base at RAF Witchford for a raid on Stuttgart, several hours later the plane crashed killing its crew near Pegsdon whilst trying to return to its base. =Manors= ;Shillington of Shillington Bury Until the Dissolution of the Monasteries the powerful Ramsey Abbey held this, with its noble arms of three rams heads with golden horns on a blue band, set on a gold (or yellow backdrop), i.e. \\"or a bend azure\\". Including much of Pegsbury as well as the hub of the village, at the Dissolution it was valued at ¬£88 2s. 10d per year and formed part of the (royal) honour of Ampthill, conferred on Princess Elizabeth, remaining in the Royal Family until after James I (or VI of Scotland). Its mesne lords (intermediate landlords) included George Rotherham (21 years), Sir Henry Hobart (99 years) for Anthony Chester (assumed title three years later), Dr. Peter Barwick, Roger Gillingham, John Borrett and finally the 1764 will of John Briscoe bequeathing Shillington Bury to Henry Earl of Sussex for life, remainder to the daughters of the late chivalric Bath King of Arms, Grey Longueville. As such, it settled in 1800 on Grey Arnold and cousin Bridget Frances Anne. Little is known of the mid-19th century except for a sale by a Miss Profit to the father of William Hanscombe, the 1908 lord of the manor. ;Shillington or Apsley Bury (Tudor to Georgian subdivision) This secondary manor was sold in 1760 to Joseph Musgrave, and henceforward it follows the same descent as Aspley Bury manor below. In 1476, when Thomas Lawley first transferred this so-called manor held of the Abbey to Thomas Rotherham Archbishop of York who left it at his death in 1500 to Thomas Rotherham, son of his brother John. His grandson Thomas and his wife Alice, for their lives were later heirs, then George, their son, who held the manor from 1561 to 1599. Then came his son John, having succeeded him, who appears to have alienated (sold or lost) this manor, as in the case of Luton to Sir Robert Napier, who held manorial court here in 1651 and like Luton it remained in this family to the death of Sir John Napier in 1714. In 1748 the manorial court was held by Sir Conyers D'Arcy, and in 1759 by his kinsman, the former Ambassador at Venice (to Italy), and at the Hague (to the Netherlands) Robert Darcy, 4th Earl of Holderness. ;Apsley or Apsley Bury Owners in succession from 1504, for this is a later manor, have been only four families: Lane, Eton, Sir John Franklin's and his grandson-in-law's, that of Sir Christopher Musgrave (with subsequent Musgraves until 1908). =Charities= Charity of Edward Pilsworth produced in 1908 a sum of ¬£12 14s \\"received annually from the Clothworkers Company, London\\", applied as follows: ¬£10 8s. in money generally among fifty parishioners, ¬£1 to the vicar, 16s. (80% of that amount) for repair of church, and 10s. to the churchwardens who assisted in its administration. In 1796 Samuel Whitbread, esq., by will, left ¬£10 10s a year, charged on the manor of Cardington, for providing clothing for the inmates (occupants) of the four almshouses situated in the churchyard. In 1897 this annuity was redeemed making an India stock transfer. Demography and topography A local adage is that 'all roads lead away from Shillington' ‚Äî somewhat true as more efficient routes avoid the village altogether. Shillington is though not demographically, physically agricultural ‚Äî mostly green-buffered strings of homes and working farms with farmhouses across a broad area. In all 1.69;km¬≤ of its 1.78‚Äìkm¬≤ is 'greenspace' leaving the remainder largely domestic gardens, roads, buildings and watercourses.Office for National Statistics: Parish: Shillington: Physical Environment: Key Statistics Retrieved 19 September 2015 The number of residents increased by a net total of 11 (0.5%) in the ten years to 2011. LocalitiesApsley End= Historically Aspley End (see manors above), this small gently sloping hamlet unusually has three moated sites in a line from north to south, all scheduled ancient monuments, two with ponds, one of which was a fishpond. The other, Pirton Grange has a settling pond, moat remains and enclosure.Scheduled Ancient Monument, north of Apsley End Scheduled Ancient Monument (2), Apsley End Scheduled Ancient Monument (3) Apsley End Sixteen houses or farmhouses are listed here for architecture, fifteen at Grade II. ;Pirton Grange At Grade II*, this is the highest listed secular building of the parish and has 15th and 16th century parts, a c. 1690 hall roof and mostly timber-framed construction, however Victorian chimneys and fireplaces.  Facilities  The village is home to Shillington Lower School. Local amenities include two shops (one in the old Methodist church), and several public houses. All Saints Church All Saints Church is mostly 14th century, with an 18th-century tower and is grade I listed. The Church is a contender for the most easterly in the triangular chalk belt enclosing most of South-East England all of East Anglia. The building was originally a Saxon monastery, which grew richer and more influential through the mining and selling of coprolite, fossilised dinosaur dung, once used as a fuel and also a fertiliser.

There was also a digital audio-only variant, Audio High Density (AHD).  Technology  VHD discs are in diameter, and store up to 60 minutes of video per side.VHD Disc World Each disc is stored in a caddy‚Äîlike the CED system from RCA, also known as SelectaVision VideoDisc, the user never handled the disc directly. The entire caddy is inserted into the player, and then withdrawn, leaving the disc inside where it will be loaded and start playing. At the end of the side the disc must be removed, turned over and re-inserted. Like the RCA system, the signal is recorded on the discs as variations in capacitance, a conductive coating on the disc itself forming part of a resonant circuit. A diamond stylus reads the signal, though unlike CED there are no actual grooves‚Äîthe stylus follows the tracks electronically, like a compact disc. This means less wear, though there is still physical contact (unlike LaserDisc) so some wear would still occur. The discs contain two frames (four fields) per revolution, and play in CAV mode, which makes play simple, as all frames start at the same place on the disc, but having two frames per rotation means that true freeze frame is not possible ‚Äî there would be some \\"jitter\\" on moving sequences (discs which were designed to be used a frame at a time - such as picture catalogues - doubled up the frames, to get true stills at the cost of reduced capacity). The VHD system had advantages over both the RCA Capacitance Electronic Disc system and the MCA/Philips LaserVision system. In active (CAV) mode (not available in CED) it had a greater capacity than LaserVision. It also had the ability to carry 99 randomly accessible 'chapters' (more than LaserVision) and had the same autostop capability. These two functions had to be programmed into the master tape from which the videodisc was made, along with the two-frame freeze frame function. This made videotape master editing a highly specialist operation requiring precise insertion of vertical interval codes into the video signal, and field accurate editing (most videotape editing required only frame accuracy). VHD was always intended as a highly interactive format, and many non-linear 'trick-play' features were supported, directly by the players or via an optional VHDpc computer interface for the MSX and Sharp X1 computers. Applications included interactive adventure games, and car engine diagnostic tools. Constructing an interactive disc required a lot of planning as well as the specialist video master editing. The costs entailed in discovering these complexities and solving the problems, as well as recognising that the video post-production technology of the time was being pushed to its limits probably contributed to the decision to withdraw the system.  History  VHD was first demonstrated in 1978, and after numerous advertisements in 1981/1982 National Geographic magazines, it was eventually released in Japan on April 21st, 1983. By this time, both LaserDisc and CED were already suffering from the onslaught of VHS and Betamax VCRs. Despite demonstrating the player at several Consumer Electronics Shows, JVC opted not to release VHD as a consumer product in North America. In the UK Thorn EMI, which was the leading consumer provider of the VHS tape system, saw VHD as the next step in the market and committed to the system. In 1981 it invested in a factory to press discs (in Swindon) and a production unit to develop a catalogue of \\"interactive\\" titles‚Äîa unique step‚Äîto support a planned 1984 launch but cancelled the investment in late 1983. VHD remained on the market in the UK primarily as an educational and training tool, usually linked to a computer, but attracted few customers. It found its main niche as a karaoke system, and was also used in anime video games and interactive training systems. Commercial versions were available in the UK (and probably the US) for training, demonstration and fault diagnosis. A stereoscopic system was also sold in Japan; these 3D VHD systems achieved the 3D effect using double- speed discs with alternate-eye images and LCS glasses to pass the correct view to each eye. VHD became obsolete after 1987. Discs continued to be manufactured up until the early 1990s.

It is a manufacturer of personal care and household cleaning products, and is a subsidiary of the German company Henkel AG & Co. KGaA (Henkel Consumer Goods Inc.). Dial began as a brand of deodorant soap manufactured by Armour and Company, a Chicago, Illinois, meatpacking firm, and through a series of mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, emerged by the 2000s as a stand-alone personal-care and household-cleaning products company. Henkel acquired The Dial Corporation in 2004. Dial soap remains one of the company's major brands. History Dial was the first antibacterial soap introduced in the United States. It was developed by chemists from Armour and Company and introduced in the Chicago market in 1948. Armour had been producing soap since 1888, first as \\"Armour Family Soap\\"; soap was made from tallow, a by-product of the meat production process. The name Dial was chosen because the soap advertised \\"'round-the- clock\\" protection against the odor caused by perspiration. Demand for this new soap exceeded expectations due to its deodorant effectiveness, its non- medicinal clover-like smell and bright golden yellow color. The brand was rolled out nationally in 1949, and in time became the leading deodorant soap brand in the United States. =Armour-Dial, Inc. (1967-1985)= Because of the popularity and strong sales of Dial soap, fueled by magazine, radio, and television advertising, Armour's consumer products business was incorporated as Armour-Dial, Inc. in 1967. In 1970, The Greyhound Corporation purchased Armour and Company (including Armour-Dial, Inc.) for $400 million as part of a diversification strategy and relocated its headquarters to Phoenix, Arizona the following year. =The Dial Corporation (1985-1995)= In 1985 Greyhound acquired the consumer products business of Purex Industries, Inc. which was combined with Armour-Dial to form The Dial Corporation. In 1988, Greyhound acquired the Boraxo, Borateem and 20 Mule Team Borax brands from U.S. Borax. To reflect the parent company's new focus after the sale of Greyhound Lines, Greyhound was renamed Greyhound Dial Corporation in 1990 and renamed again, to The Dial Corp the following year. After the parent company was renamed The Dial Corp, the Dial consumer business was known as The Dial Corp Consumer Products Group. Greyhound also acquired Breck Shampoo from Shulton in 1990 and Renuzit from S. C. Johnson & Son in 1993. =The new Dial Corporation (1996-2017)= In late 1995, parent company The Dial Corp announced its intention to split the company and spin off the Dial consumer products business. After the spin off, Dial's now former parent company was renamed Viad Corp, consisting of the service businesses. The Dial consumer business was reborn as the new Dial Corporation, relocating its corporate offices to Scottsdale, Arizona, adjacent to its long-time research and development facility. Under new CEO, Malcolm Jozoff, a former P&G; executive, the new Dial Corporation underwent major layoffs in the fall of 1996 and a series of financially disastrous acquisitions the following four years. In 1997, Dial sold the Brillo business to Church & Dwight. Between 1999 and 2000, Dial formed two joint-ventures with German company Henkel. The first, Dial/Henkel LLC, was established in 1999 which introduced Purex Advanced laundry detergent and acquired Custom Cleaner home dry cleaning products. The second joint venture company, Dial/Henkel Mexico S.A. de C.V. was established for operations in Mexico. By 2002, both ventures were discontinued because of losses and Dial sold its stake in the Mexico venture to Henkel. In 2000, Jozoff resigned and was replaced by Herbert Baum with a mandate from the board of directors to find a suitable buyer for the company. That same year, Dial acquired Coast soap and Zout stain remover. In December 2003, Dial was acquired by Henkel for $2.9 billion. As a consequence of Henkel's acquisition of Dial, Henkel divested its 29% stake in The Clorox Company for $2.84 billion in cash and assets, which included the Soft Scrub and Combat brands. In 2006, Dial acquired the Right Guard, Soft & Dri and Dry Idea deodorant brands from Procter & Gamble for $420 million. On March 1, 2006, Dial completed the sale of its food business for $183 million to Pinnacle Foods. The food business produces shelf-stable canned meat products (such as potted meat and Vienna sausages) and ready meals under the Armour Star brand, had sales of approximately $230 million in fiscal 2005. In 2012, Henkel sold Dial's Coast, Pure & Natural and Soft & Dri brands to Brynwood Partners' High Ridge Brands for an undisclosed amount. In 2016, Henkel acquired laundry detergent manufacturer Sun Products for $3.6 billion. In July 2017, Dial relocated its headquarters from Scottsdale, Arizona to Stamford, Connecticut in order to consolidate its operations with Sun Products and be closer to parent Henkel's North American headquarters (Henkel Corporation) in Rocky Hill, Connecticut. After consolidation, the business was renamed Henkel North American Consumer Goods.

The United States of America controlled the Philippines at the time and possessed important military bases there. The combined American-Filipino army was defeated in the Battle of Bataan and the Battle of Corregidor in April 1942, but guerrilla resistance against the Japanese continued throughout the war. Uncaptured Filipino army units, a communist insurgency, and supporting American agents all played a role in the resistance. Due to the huge number of islands, the Japanese never occupied many of the smaller and more minor islands. Japanese control over the countryside and smaller towns was often tenuous at best. In 1944, Allied forces liberated the islands from Japanese control in a naval invasion. Background In September 1940, Nazi Germany, Kingdom of Italy, and Empire of Japan had allied under the Tripartite Coalition as the Axis powers. The United States banned the shipment of aviation gasoline to Japan in July 1940, and by 1941 shipments of scrap iron, steel, gasoline and other materials had practically ceased. Meanwhile, American economic support to China began to increase. Japan and the USSR signed a neutrality pact in April 1941 and Japan increased pressure on the French and Dutch colonies in Southeast Asia to cooperate in economic matters. Japanese forces occupied the naval and air bases of southern French Indochina on 22 July 1941. The Philippines was almost completely surrounded. General George C. Marshall, US Army Chief of Staff, stated, \\"Adequate reinforcements for the Philippines, at this time, would have left the United States in a position of great peril, should there be a break in the defense of Great Britain.\\" A campaign for independence from the US which had been ongoing since 1919 resulted on 17 January 1933 in the passage by the US Congress of the Hare‚ÄìHawes‚ÄìCutting Act over the veto of President Herbert Hoover. The law promised Philippine independence after 10 years, but reserved several military and naval bases for the United States, as well as imposing tariffs and quotas on Philippine exports. Philippine Senate President Manuel L. Quezon convinced the legislature to reject the bill. Subsequently, the Tydings‚ÄìMcDuffie Act, which eliminated provisions for US military reservations and substituted a provision for \\"ultimate settlement\\", became US law on 24 March 1934 and was accepted by the Philippine legislature on 1 May. The impact of this on the future defense of the Philippines with the establishment was to prove disastrous. During the 10-year transition period, the Philippine Constabulary was vested with an ever-increasing responsibility for defending the borders of the Philippines. The forces of the US Army settled at around 10,000 men. The US Army had, however, already spent millions constructing forts and air strips throughout Luzon. This included the harbor defenses in Manila Bay, at Fort Mills on Corregidor Island and at Grande Island in Subic Bay. There were also bases at Nichols Air Station (now Villamor Airbase), Nielson Air Base (now Ayala Triangle in Makati City‚ÄîAyala and Paseo de Roxas Avenues lay over the original landing strips), at Fort William McKinley (now Fort Andres Bonifacio and the American Cemetery), Camp Murphy (now Camp Aguinaldo and Camp Crame) in Quezon City, Camp O'Donnell in Tarlac and a series of airbases and army installations in Pampanga including Fort Stotsenburg, Clark Air Base, as well as Camp Wallace in La Union, the Naval Station in Sangley Point, Cavite City, Camp Keithley in Lanao, Camp Eldridge in Los Ba√±os, Laguna and Camp Henry T. Allen in Baguio. Other fields in Tugegarao, Aparri, Isabela, Nueva Ecija, Legaspi, Bataan, and Del Monte in Davao were also built using US funds prior to and during the first years of the 1935 provisional Commonwealth. The Philippine Army Philippine Commonwealth Army personnel in Davao The date for Philippine Independence and US military withdrawal was approaching, resulting in a reduction in funds from the US military to directly support the expansion of the Philippine Commonwealth Army. Twelve Million US dollars were provided to the Commonwealth for the establishment of the Philippine Army in 1936. In the early years of the Commonwealth, the Philippine Army was composed of an Active Duty and a Reserve Component. The Active Duty component was the Philippine Constabulary, which was a para-military organization. After the outbreak of the war, this was referred to as the First Philippine Division. Many of the officers of the Philippine Army and Philippine Army Air Corps came from the members of the Philippine Constabulary and Air Constabulary. Far Eastern Command On 25 July 1941, US Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson requested that US President Franklin D. Roosevelt issue orders calling the military forces of the Commonwealth into active service for the United States. Stimson explained, \\"All practical steps should be taken to increase the defensive strength of the Philippine Islands.\\" The following day President Roosevelt froze all Japanese assets within the United States and issued orders to absorb the forces of the Philippine Army. That same day the War Department created the US Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE) command, with jurisdiction over the Philippine Department and the military forces of the Commonwealth. At the same time General Douglas MacArthur was recalled to active duty and designated the commander of the USAFFE. Naval Forces At the outbreak of war the United States Navy's Asiatic Fleet was stationed at Cavite Naval Base in Manila Bay. Also stationed there was the Offshore Patrol. Mobilization and Reinforcement MacArthur ordered the mobilization of the Philippine Army beginning on 1 September. Elements of 10 Filipino reserve divisions were to be called into the service of the United States Army by 15 December. Battalions were not organized by the time of the Japanese invasion in December. However, a force of a hundred thousand or more Filipinos was raised. New Mexico Army National Guard on Luzon On 14 August Brigadier General Leonard T. Gerow argued that the Philippine Department could not resist a Japanese attack. He thus recommended that the Philippines be reinforced with anti-aircraft artillery, modern aircraft and tanks. On 16 August, MacArthur was informed that by 5 September he could expect the 200th Coast Artillery Regiment (AA), the 192nd and 194th Tank Battalions and a company of the 17th Ordnance Battalion. On 5 September Marshall asked MacArthur if he wanted a National Guard Division, probably the 41st. MacArthur replied that he did not need any additional divisions. He also stated, \\"Equipment and supplies are essential. If these steps are taken, I am confident that no such backing, the development of a completely adequate defense force will be rapid.\\" During September and October, in addition to the above-mentioned reinforcements, MacArthur received the 192nd Tank Battalion and 75 self-propelled 75 mm guns. MacArthur strove to reorganize the Philippine Division from a square into a triangular formation. This plan involved shipping in an American infantry regiment and or complementing Stotsenburg and allow USAFFE control of 2 American combat teams. These plans also involved the formation of four tactical commands, each of corps strength, along with various additional support units. By November the War Department had approved additional reinforcements of 1,312 officers, 25 nurses and 18,047 men. The 34th Infantry Regiment was scheduled to ship out from San Francisco on 8 December 1941. By 5 December fifty-five ships were en route from San Francisco carrying 100,000 ship-tons of cargo to the Philippines. On board were the personnel and equipment of the 26th Field Artillery Brigade, including the 147th Field Artillery, 75 mm, Truck Drawn, Regiment of the South Dakota National Guard; the 148th Field Artillery, 75 mm, Truck Drawn, Regiment of the Idaho National Guard and the 2nd Battalion of the 131st Field Artillery, 75 mm, Truck Drawn, Regiment of the Texas National Guard. These units were diverted to Hawaii and assigned to its defenses. Philippine Army Air Corps When the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor took place, there were several air elements en route. This included 52 A-24 Banshee dive bombers of the 27th Bombardment Group, eighteen P-40s of the 35th Pursuit Group, 340 tons of bombs and 9,000 drums of aviation fuel. There were also two light field ground echelons of the 7th Bombardment Group, which arrived in the Philippines and were relocated to Mariveles after the evacuation of Manila. The air echelon squadrons of the 7th were en route to the Philippines and arrived in Pearl Harbor on the morning of 7 December 1941. They consisted of 9th, 463rd, 492nd, and 493d Heavy Bombardment Squadrons. The air echelon was diverted back to the US and then routed to Java through Australia. Materiel and Training Deficiencies The Philippine Army received clothing that was of poor quality. Their rubber shoes would wear out within 2 weeks. There were shortages of nearly every kind of equipment such as blankets, mosquito bars, shelter halves, entrenching tools, gas masks, and helmets. During August, MacArthur had requested 84,500 M1 Garand rifles, 330 .30-caliber machine guns, 326 .50-caliber machine-guns, 450 37mm guns, 217 81 mm mortars, 288 75 mm guns, and over 8,000 vehicles. On 18 September, he was informed that, because of lend-lease commitments, he would not receive most of these items. As a result, the Philippine Army was forced to continue using the old Enfield and Springfield rifles. The shipment of supplies depended upon the US Navy's limited cargo capacity. In September, the Navy announced its intentions to convert three transports into escort carriers, but this was not done after MacArthur observed that the loss of three transports would delay his reinforcements by more than two months. The army then approved requests for 105 mm howitzers, 75 mm pack howitzers, 75 mm guns, .30-caliber machine guns, 37 mm guns, ten 250 ft station hospitals, one hundred and eighty sets of regimental infirmary equipment, jeeps, ambulances, trucks and sedans. By November, there were 1,100,000 tons of equipment, intended for the Philippines, piled up in US ports. Most of this never reached its destination. Meanwhile, the Navy did manage to transport 1,000,000 gallons of gasoline to the island. Much of this fuel would be stored on the Bataan Peninsula. In 1941, many Filipino units went into battle without ever having fired their weapons. Many of the troops had also never even seen an artillery piece fired. The 31st Infantry Division (PA) signal officer was unable to establish radio communication with other units in the same camp. The commander of the Philippine 31st Infantry Division, Colonel Bluemel stated, \\"The enlisted men are proficient in only two things, one, when an officer appears, to yell 'attention' in a loud voice, jump up, and salute; two, to demand 3 meals per day.\\" Training and coordination were further complicated by language barriers. Enlisted Filipinos often spoke one language (such as Bikol or a Visayan language), their officers would speak another (such as Tagalog) and the Americans would speak English. There were some first sergeants and company clerks who could neither read nor write. The Japanese decide to attack Advancing Japanese troops moving toward Manila. The Japanese viewed all the lands of Asia to be the rightful property of the Imperial Japanese Government and the Emperor. The seizures of Korea, China and parts of Russia, which had begun at the turn of the 20th century, had been taking an upswing. The Japanese had been kept from realizing their goal of unifying or dominating the Asian lands by the presence of foreign military forces in the Philippines (United States), Hong Kong, Malaysia (United Kingdom) and the Dutch East Indies. Japan had hoped that they could strike fast and hold off reinforcements long enough to broker a peace accord from a position of strength. Central to the Japanese goals was the taking of all Asian lands. To be successful US, UK, and Dutch forces were to be attacked simultaneously to prevent their ability to reinforce and aid their Asian possessions. Pivotal to the Japanese decision to attack was a tremendous need for crude oil as a result of economic sanctions imposed by the United States, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands which was weakening the Japanese economy. The Japanese leaders were faced with a choice: end the war in China and their plans for Asian conquest, so as to end the sanctions, or declare war on three large military forces. The current war against Britain, and the Netherlands, and the strain of providing aid by the United States to these countries was seen as an opportunity by the Japanese to extend their \\"rightful\\" place as a ruler in Asia. The Japanese government decided to seize resources under the control of Britain, the United States and the Netherlands. Japan had already placed over ten divisions in Formosa (Taiwan). Japanese military planners argued that the British (and the USSR should they decide to declare war), would be unable to effectively respond to a Japanese attack, given the threat posed by the Third Reich.

According to Roman sources (the only written history of the time), he was a guerrilla warrior or bandit in Cantabria during the 1st century BC, who, according to Cassius Dio, raided Roman territory causing considerable depredation in the area. Dio says that Corocotta's depredations caused Augustus to offer a large reward for his capture. Corocotta himself came forward to receive it, impressing Augustus with his audacity. Dio is the only source for the story. The Story from a Cantabrian viewpoint Cantabrians are well aware of the story of how the Roman Empire struggled to conquer them, or actually never really did (see the Cantabrian Wars). During that time, there would have been many warriors (male and female) who would have fought bravely to preserve their way of life and defend their people. Corocotta (or for some would be spelt Korokota, more similar to the neighbouring Basque language) would have been one of these warriors. The Cantabrian story says that he was probably a respected chief or warrior of some of the Cantabrian tribes and that such was the Romans anger towards him, that they set an enormously high price on his head. In response to this, Corocotta turned himself into the Roman Emperor with the purpose of claiming the big financial reward himself and he willingly offering his life (head) in exchange. This decision by Corocotta is viewed by Cantabrians as an act of self-sacrifice and it is believed that his act was intended to avoid any problems that could be created by the reward acting as a temptation for fellow Cantabrians to betray him or turning him in. Instead, Corocotta would take that vast sum of money (or his people would do for him after being killed) and distribute it amongst the people of Cantabria, who had suffered from years of war against the Romans. Such an act of bravery would affect the Roman morale, and the Cantabrians were well known for coming up with very creative and efficient warfare techniques, like singing hymns of victory from the Roman crosses that crucified them or cavalry and infantry moves in which they used the Cantabrian labarum as a flag to signal army manoeuvres, a tactic later copied by the Romans themselves. The story sometimes ends by saying that the Roman Emperor, bemused by Corocotta's bravery, let him go with his life and his money, but this ending is not always clear. The Story from a Roman viewpoint Dio tells the story as part of an account of Augustus's forgiving nature. He writes that: According to Peter Michael Swan the main purpose of the story is to contrast the clemency of Augustus with the vindictiveness of Dio's b√™te noire, Septimius Severus. Thomas Gr√ºnewald says that Dio wished to stress that Augustus had \\"a strong sense of humour and unshakeable self-confidence\\", and to compare this with the brutality that was the product of Severus' insecurity, represented by his vicious treatment of a similar \\"noble bandit\\" called Bulla Felix. Interpretations Cantabria at the time of Corocotta. Cantabria was the last part of Spain to resist Roman oocupation Whether Corocotta was a bandit or a leader of local resistance to Roman occupation has been a matter of dispute. Cassius Dio simply describes him as a bandit (Greek: leistes), but as Gr√ºnewald notes, the Greek term leistes can be used in a range of roles wider than English \\"bandit\\" or \\"robber\\" would indicate, including \\"rebel, rival, avenger\\".Gr√ºnewald, Thomas, Bandits in the Roman Empire, pp. 1‚Äì3. =Name= The name \\"corocotta\\" has been interpreted as a nickname indicative of his ferocity, a variant of crocotta, a word used to refer to a type of canine-like beast from Africa, most likely a hyena or jackal.D. Braund, ‚ÄúCorocottas: Bandit and Hyena,‚Äù Liverpool Classical Monthly 5 (1980), 13‚Äì14 In the words of Gr√ºnewald, \\"It can have been no accident that the infamous Corocotta shared his name with an exotic predator, well known to circus audiences as a terrifying beast.\\" Pliny the Elder described the animal as a cross between a hyena and a lion, though the term may also have been used for other similar animals.Thomas Gr√ºnewald, John Drinkwater (trans), Bandits in the Roman Empire: Myth and Reality, Routledge, London, 2004, pp.112; 206 Dio himself refers to it, but says it is an \\"Indian species\\" like a \\"lioness and tiger combined\\". He does so in a section of his book about the reign of Severus and makes no connection to it when he discusses the Cantabrian bandit.Cassius Dio, Roman History, Epitome of Book LXXVII Adolf Schulten argued in 1943 that the name Corocotta may be only accidentally similar to that of the animal.A. Schulten, Los c√°ntabros y astures y su guerra con Roma, Madrid, 1943 (reed. 1962, 1969, 2000), p. 155 He interpreted it as a Celtic name. *Cor(i)o- was a common element in Continental Celtic personal and place names (perhaps meaning \\"shot, launch\\" or \\"army\\"; comparing Celtic ‚Äì or Lusitanian (\\"Para-Celtic\\") ‚Äì personal names such as Corogeni, Coroturetis, Coroneri, Corobulti, Coromarae, Corolamus, Corogennates, et al.)Blanca Maria Prosper, \\"Sifting the evidence: New interpretations on Celtic and Non‚ÄìCeltic personal names of western Hispania in the light of phonetics, composition and suffixation\\", in: J.L. G. Alonso, ed.: Continental Celtic word formation. The onomastic data, Salamanca, eds. Universidad de Salamanca, 2014, pp. 181‚Äì200 Leonard Curchin proposes that the second element is from the Celtic root *cotto \\"old\\".Curchin, Leonard A. (2007) Toponyms of Lusit√¢nia: a re-assessment of their origins, in: Conimbriga, vol. 46 (2007), p. 129-160. Schulten argued that he was more likely to have been an anti-Roman rebel than a simple bandit, and should be seen in the context of the Cantabrian wars (29‚Äì19 BC), the last stand of independent Spanish Celtic tribes against Roman control. He probably led a band of rebels who continued resistance to Roman power in northern Spain for some time after other leaders had given up. Schulten argues that he must have surrendered to Augustus at some time during the emperor's visit to the area c. 26‚Äì25 BC. =Hero or myth= Schulten's version allowed Corocotta to be appropriated in Spain as a patriotic hero of resistance to Roman rule, comparable to the status of the Lusitanian anti-Roman resistance leader Viriatus in Portugal. Peter Michael Swan quotes F. Diego Santos describing him as \\"a Cantabrian guerrilla leader; his surrender possibly belongs to Augustus‚Äô sojourn in Spain ca. 15‚Äì14 B.C.\\"Peter Michael Swan, The Augustan Succession: An Historical Commentary on Cassius Dio's Roman History, Books 55‚Äì56 (9 BC-AD 14), Oxford University Press, 2004, p.347-8 He is the hero of Paul Naschy's 1980 sword and sandal film Los c√°ntabros (The Cantabrians), and has appeared as a resistance hero in several other works.e.g. El √∫ltimo soldurio (2005), a novel by Javier Lorenzo; El mundo de Corocotta (2010) a play by Fernando Rebana. In 1985 a statue identified as Corocotta was erected in Santander. The statue, by Ram√≥n Ru√≠z Lloreda, officially represents the independent spirit of \\"the primitive Cantabrian\\" illustrating a line from Horace, \\"Cantabrum indoctum iuga ferre nostra\\" (\\"the Cantabrian, who has not been taught to bear our yoke\\").Canal TVEtnografia, Monumento al C√°ntabro In 2007 Alicia M. Canto argued that the text of Dio does not justify placing Corocotta in the context of Cantabrian resistance to Rome. She suggests that Corocotta was merely a bandit, and surmises that he was probably of North African origin on the basis that the crocotta was said by most authors to come from Africa.Alicia. M.

Brunstane partly consists of new housing, such as the Gilberstoun estate, and also contains the 1950s council housing schemes known as Magdalene and the Christians, which are south and north of Milton Road respectively. Prominent local features include the Milton Road campus of the Edinburgh College and Edinburgh's largest Asda supermarket. Extensive shopping and some leisure facilities are close by at the Fort Kinnaird retail park nearby, on the site of the former Newcraighall coalmine. Brunstane House Much of the area at one time constituted the policies of Brunstane House (i.e. the lands attached to the mansion). Occupied from medieval times and sometimes referred to as Gilbertoun, during the Reformation the house was occupied by the Crichton family, infamous for conspiring against Cardinal Beaton. In 1545 both George Wishart and John Knox stayed at the house. The current house was built in 1639 for John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale, incorporating an L-plan house dating from the 1560s and early 14th century elements built for the Crichton family. It was extended by Sir William Bruce in 1672 and bought by Andrew Fletcher, Lord Milton in 1733. He employed William Adam to rebuild parts of the house and install interior panelling, plasterwork and other features. The house includes some of the earliest known examples of sash windows in Scotland (invented in 1690). The house had an interesting sales history, changing hands many times. *19 March 1703 - inherited by Lyonell, Earl of Dysart only son of the Duchess of Lauderdale. *31 May 1736 - sold to the Duke of Argyll *1746 - sold to James, 3rd Earl of Abercorn *28 September 1747 - part of land sold by James to Andrew Fletcher, Lord Milton (who had been Lord Justice Clerk since 1735). He died in his house 13 December 1766. *15 February 1769 - properties reamalgamated and sold to James, 8th Earl of Abercorn. *In 1875 his descendant the 1st Duke of Abercorn sold the house to the Benhar Coal Company for the mineral rights. They parcelled off the land and sold on the house, now stripped of its estate lands. *The house was split in two in the 20th century. One half is now owned by George Kerevan.

Playing career He began his career with Liverpool, where he also won England Youth international caps. He then moved on to Portsmouth and later Aldershot. Coaching and managerial career  After injury ended his career in 1966, he turned his hand to coaching, at Portsmouth and then, with greater success, at Queens Park Rangers. He went on to work under Bertie Mee at Arsenal as first-team coach, after Steve Burtenshaw's resignation and subsequent departure to Sheffield Wednesday in 1973. His first managerial job came at Fulham in 1976, after his former boss Alec Stock was sacked. Campbell made a poor start winning no games in his first 3 months as manager. After four years of underachievement Campbell was sacked when the team made a poor start to the 1980‚Äì81 season after a disastrous relegation the previous season. He moved on to Portsmouth, whom he led to the Third Division title in 1982‚Äì83. However, he was sacked in May 1984 after Portsmouth only narrowly avoided being immediately relegated back to the Third Division. Campbell then returned to Queens Park Rangers for a stint as reserve team manager, before taking up the same position at Chelsea in the summer of 1987. Towards the end of the 1987‚Äì88 season, Campbell was appointed assistant to manager John Hollins, with the team in the midst of a relegation battle; one month later Hollins was sacked and Campbell appointed caretaker manager until the end of the season. Campbell was unable to turn around the club's fortunes in the eight games which remained that season, and they were relegated via the short-lived play-off system. He made amends the following season, however, as his side romped to promotion as Second Division champions with a haul of 99 points. A year later, he led to Chelsea to a 5th- place finish in the First Division, their highest league placing since 1970. He was relieved of his managerial duties after an 11th-place finish and appointed personal assistant to Chelsea chairman Ken Bates in 1991. Campbell went on to coach in Kuwait where he managed the two biggest clubs in the country: Al-Arabi SC and Qadsia SC. Death He died on 6 November 2015.

His influential book, Die Freigabe der Vernichtung lebensunwerten Lebens (\\"Allowing the Destruction of Life Unworthy of Living\\"), written together with the psychiatrist Alfred Hoche, was used by the Nazis to justify their T-4 Euthanasia Program.  Life  Binding was born in Frankfurt am Main, the third child of Georg Christoph Binding and Dorothea Binding. In 1860 Binding moved to G√∂ttingen where he studied history and jurisprudence. After a short stay in Heidelberg, where he won a law prize, he moved back to G√∂ttingen to finish his studies. In 1864 he completed his habilitation paper in Latin about Roman criminal law and lectured in criminal law at Heidelberg University. Two years later he was appointed professor of law of state and criminal law and procedure in Basel, Switzerland. In the same year he married Marie Luise Wirsing and published Das burgundisch-romanische K√∂nigreich and Entwurf eines Strafgesetzbuches f√ºr den Norddeutschen Bund. At this time he also became friends with Johann Jacob Bernoulli - an archaeologist, Jakob Burckhardt - an art historian, and Friedrich Nietzsche - a philosopher. In August 1867 his first son, Rudolf Georg, was born, followed two years later by his second son. Rudolf G Binding later became a famous writer. Karl Binding and his wife were to have one more son and two daughters. In 1869 his family moved to Freiburg, and Binding volunteered to fight in the Franco-Prussian War. Although his lack of military training meant he was unable to serve as a soldier, he was accepted as an orderly and posted to the front, serving in a field hospital. In 1872 he took on a post at the Reichs University in Stra√üburg. In the same year he moved to Leipzig University, where he was to continue to work for the next 40 years. From 1879 until 1900 Binding worked in the district court of Leipzig. After becoming Leipzig University's rector and receiving his emeritus, he moved to Freiburg, where his wife died only a few days later at 71 years old. In 1918, during the First World War, Binding left Germany to lecture German soldiers in Macedonia and Bulgarian intellectuals in Sofia.  Ideas Allowing the destruction of life unworthy of living: Die Freigabe der Vernichtung Lebensunwerten Lebens= This was the title of one of Binding's most infamous books, co-written by the psychiatrist, Alfred Hoche.https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Datei:BindingHoche_FreigabeCoverAufl22.jpg The book was divided into two parts, the first written by Binding, the second by Hoche. Binding discussed the consequences that the legal status of suicide would have on euthanasia and the legality of killing the mentally ill. Hoche concentrated on the relationship of doctors to their patients and the seriously ill. (See Alfred Hoche.) Binding and Hoche are noted for the influence their work had on the Nazis and especially the Aktion T4 Euthanasia Program. =Two possible interpretations of German law= In Binding's own interpretation of the law in 1920s Germany, suicide or attempting suicide was not illegal and should be treated as being within the law. This would mean that no-one would have the right to stop a person from killing themselves and that a person who wants to die would even have the right to defend themselves against such an attempt. Binding goes on to assume that the right to suicide would then also have to be transferable to another person; meaning that a person also has the right to let someone else cause their death if they so wish. In this case, anyone that has killed a seriously ill person, acting on the behalf of that person, has acted within the law. Binding's second possible interpretation of German law meant that suicide was neither legal nor illegal. He argued that the law concerning murder only referred to the killing of other people and not to suicide. In this case suicide would be perfectly legal, but euthanasia, involving the killing of another person, even with their permission, would have to be treated as murder. Again, if suicide is not illegal, then no one can stop another person from killing themselves. Binding noted that in reality, the majority of people who prevent a suicide attempt are not usually prosecuted and that most people who are prevented from killing themselves do not make a second attempt. He was of the opinion that in a case of prosecution due to euthanasia, the court should differentiate between the taking of a healthy life and a terminally ill person. =Definition of euthanasia= Binding defined euthanasia as occurring when a person gives a terminally ill person, with the intention of reducing pain, a medicine which either immediately or eventually leads to that person's painless death. For a case of euthanasia to stay within the law, the medicine must enable the person to die painlessly at or around the same time as they would have otherwise died. In this way the doctor is simply exchanging the cause of death, from a painful one caused by illness to a painless one caused by a medicament. Any killing which involves the shortening of a life was seen as unlawful. Binding claimed the killing of the terminally ill was not an exception to the law against murder but was a lawful act in the interests of the patient. It put an end to their terrible suffering and should not be seen as a killing but as a reduction in their suffering. Binding did not think it necessary to obtain permission from a person who was to be killed, but if they were able to and expressed the wish to live, that wish must be respected. Binding split the group of people which he wanted to be considered for killing into three groups, \\"two larger ones and a middle group\\". *1 A person who has been mortally wounded or is terminally ill and has somehow communicated their wish to die. The person does not have to be in pain, it is enough that they are in a helpless condition and that their condition is incurable. It is also irrelevant if the person could be saved in another situation. *2 A person that is incurably mentally ill. Binding describes these people as having neither the will to die, nor the will to live. They are \\"living pointless lives and are a burden for society and their families\\". He also believed it to be unfair on carers to keep such ‚Äúlives unworthy of living‚Äù alive. *3 The people belonging to the middle group, were ‚Äúmentally healthy‚Äù people, which having suffered a serious injury are now unconscious. If they ever awake, they \\"will awake to a nameless suffering\\". \\"Their killing should not be seen as a killing as such but as saving the person from a terrible end.\\" Binding could not work out a general rule for the killing of this group. Importantly he accepted that many killings of these people would actually be unjustifiable, although this would only be evident after death. He believed that the law would treat such killings as manslaughter. This led him to argue for a new law to allow for such killings which according with his views would have been \\"justifiable\\". Binding wanted a committee to decide on a killing on a case-by-case basis. The committee was to consist of a doctor, a psychiatrist or other doctor and a jurist to check that the committee was acting within the law. The committee would be able to call witnesses and was also to have a chairperson - without voting rights - to run the proceedings. Neither the applicant nor their doctor could be members of the committee. An applicant could represent themselves, be represented by their doctor, family or anyone they had asked. Binding was of the opinion \\"that it is quite possible for a person under the age of 18 or for the mentally ill\\" to decide whether they want to live or die. After a committee had checked that a person fulfils the criteria, it could make a decision. For a decision to be final, it would have to be agreed upon by all three parties and must be made purely out of pity and the killing must be done painlessly. Any person could withdraw their application to be killed at any time, including after the decision had been finalised. In the case of an unconscious person or the mentally ill, Binding allowed the final decision to be made by the mother. If the family were willing to take on the person themselves or pay the costs of hospitalisation, the person would not be killed. In the case of a conscious person the person's wishes were to be respected regardless of the interests or requests of the family. =Killings without the jurisdiction of a committee= Binding also wanted to allow for killings that were not controlled by a committee. Such a killing would only be legal if the person killing had either acted with permission, or on the assumption that an unconscious person wanted to die. After the death a committee must be able to be satisfied that the killing fulfilled all of the usual requirements. Binding argued that although there is always a possibility of killing the wrong person, \\"that which is good and reasonable must take place irrespective of any possibility of error\\". He saw the risk of losing a life as unimportant because \\"humanity constantly loses so many lives by mistake, that just one more would hardly make a difference\\".

While propositional logic can only express facts, autoepistemic logic can express knowledge and lack of knowledge about facts. The stable model semantics, which is used to give a semantics to logic programming with negation as failure, can be seen as a simplified form of autoepistemic logic. Syntax The syntax of autoepistemic logic extends that of propositional logic by a modal operator \\\\BoxTo clarify, the modal operator \\\\Box is a medium white square; this is not a browser rendering issue indicating knowledge: if F is a formula, \\\\Box F indicates that F is known. As a result, \\\\Box eg F indicates that eg F is known and eg \\\\Box F indicates that F is not known. This syntax is used for allowing reasoning based on knowledge of facts. For example, eg \\\\Box F \\\\rightarrow eg F means that F is assumed false if it is not known to be true. This is a form of negation as failure. Semantics The semantics of autoepistemic logic is based on the expansions of a theory, which have a role similar to models in propositional logic. While a propositional model specifies which axioms are true or false, an expansion specifies which formulae \\\\Box F are true and which ones are false. In particular, the expansions of an autoepistemic formula T makes this distinction for every subformula \\\\Box F contained in T. This distinction allows T to be treated as a propositional formula, as all its subformulae containing \\\\Box are either true or false. In particular, checking whether T entails F in this condition can be done using the rules of the propositional calculus. In order for an initial assumption to be an expansion, it must be that a subformula F is entailed if and only if \\\\Box F has been initially assumed true. In terms of possible world semantics, an expansion of T consists of an S5 model of T in which the possible worlds consist only of worlds where T is true. [The possible worlds need not contain all such consistent worlds; this corresponds to the fact that modal propositions are assigned truth values before checking derivability of the ordinary propositions.] Thus, autoepistemic logic extends S5; the extension is proper, since eg \\\\Box p and eg \\\\Box eg p are tautologies of autoepistemic logic, but not of S5. For example, in the formula T = \\\\Box x \\\\rightarrow x, there is only a single ‚Äúboxed subformula‚Äù, which is \\\\Box x. Therefore, there are only two candidate expansions, assuming it true or false, respectively. The check for them being actual expansions is as follows. \\\\Box x is false : with this assumption, T becomes tautological, as \\\\Box x \\\\rightarrow x is equivalent to eg \\\\Box x \\\\vee x, and eg \\\\Box x is assumed true; therefore, x is not entailed. This result confirms the assumption implicit in \\\\Box x being false, that is, that x is not currently known. Therefore, the assumption that \\\\Box x is false is an expansion. \\\\Box x is true : together with this assumption, T entails x; therefore, the initial assumption that is implicit in \\\\Box x being true, i.e., that x is known to be true, is satisfied. As a result, this is another expansion. The formula T has therefore two expansions, one in which x is not known and one in which x is known. The second one has been regarded as unintuitive, as the initial assumption that \\\\Box x is true is the only reason why x is true, which confirms the assumption. In other words, this is a self- supporting assumption. A logic allowing such a self-support of beliefs is called not strongly grounded to differentiate them from strongly grounded logics, in which self-support is not possible. Strongly grounded variants of autoepistemic logic exist. Generalizations In uncertain inference, the known/unknown duality of truth values is replaced by a degree of certainty of a fact or deduction; certainty may vary from 0 (completely uncertain/unknown) to 1 (certain/known). In probabilistic logic networks, truth values are also given a probabilistic interpretation (i.e. truth values may be uncertain, and, even if almost certain, they may still be \\"probably\\" true (or false).)

Born in America, he was raised in Ireland. He published a number of volumes of poetry, two collections of short stories and two volumes of memoir. He was one of the best known Irish contemporary poets. In 1998 he became the first occupant of the Ireland Chair of Poetry (essentially Ireland's poet laureate). In 2010, he was made a Chevalier de la Legion d'honneur, France's highest civil award. Early life John Montague was born in Brooklyn, New York City, New York, on 28 February 1929. His father, James Montague, an Ulster Catholic, from County Tyrone, had gone to America in 1925 to join his brother John. Both were sons of John Montague, who had been a JP, combining his legal duties with being a schoolmaster, farmer, postmaster and director of several firms. John continued as postmaster but James became involved in the turbulent Irish Republican scene in the years after 1916, particularly complicated in areas like Fermanagh and Tyrone, on the borders of the newly divided island. Molly (Carney) Montague joined her husband James in America in 1928, with their two elder sons. John was born on Bushwick Avenue at St. Catherine's Hospital, and spent his earliest years playing with his brothers in the streets of Brooklyn, putting nickels on the trolley lines, playing on a tenement roof, seeing early Mickey Mouse movies. =Return to Garvaghey= Although the uncle John ran a speakeasy, where he employed his brother James, life in New York was difficult during the Great Depression, so the three boys were shipped back to Ireland in 1933, the two eldest to their maternal grandmother's house in Fintona, County Tyrone, where they had been born, but John was sent to his father's ancestral home at Garvaghey, then maintained by two spinster aunts, Brigid and Freda, who welcomed the boy of four. From New York to a farm on the edge of the Clogher Valley in County Tyrone was a significant step backwards in time. John did all the usual farming chores. He became a normal Ulster farm child, though haunted by the disparity between what the house in Garvaghey had been, in the days of his grandfather and namesake, and the reduced present. Montague reminisced about the gardens of his Ulster home in his poem, \\"Paths\\". John went first to Garvaghey School and then to Glencull, three miles away, where he was coached by a young and ardent master. Scholarships brought him to St. Patrick's College, Armagh, the junior diocesan seminary and the place where his Jesuit uncle, Thomas Montague, had gone. =Education= John Montague studied at University College Dublin in 1946. He found an extraordinary contrast between the Ulster of the war years and post-war Dublin, where the atmosphere was introverted and melancholy. Stirred by the example of other student poets (including Thomas Kinsella) he began to publish his first poems in The Dublin Magazine, Envoy, and The Bell, edited by Peadar O'Donnell. But the atmosphere in Dublin was still constrained and Montague left for Yale on a Fulbright Fellowship in 1953. John had already met Saul Bellow at the Salzburg Seminar in American Studies and now he worked with Robert Penn Warren as well as auditing the classes of several Yale critics, like Rene Wellek and W. K. Wimsatt. He extended his sense of contemporary American literature, attending Indiana Summer School of Letters where he heard Richard Wilbur, Leslie Fiedler, and John Crowe Ransom, who like the Irish poet Austin Clarke, encouraged Montague, finding him a job at the Iowa Writers' Workshop in 1954 and 1955. Middle years: 1950s and 1960s From Iowa to Berkeley, a year of graduate school convinced Montague that he should return to Ireland. He sailed back to France that summer, to marry his first wife, Madeleine,The full Montague. Independent.ie (24 June 2001).

Working by day at the Irish Tourist Office, Montague at last gathered his first book of poems, Poisoned Lands (1961). That year he also moved to Paris, to a small studio a block away from Samuel Beckett, with whom he slowly became on good drinking terms.John Montague. Ireland ‚Äì Poetry International Web There, he also met another neighbour, the French poet Claude Esteban, with whom he became friends ‚Äì Montague later translated into English and published some of his poems.Poems by Claude Esteban translated by John Montague: A Smile between the stones, Agenda Editions (Mayfield, UK), 2005, and On the Last Heath, in Poetry (Chicago, Oct.-Nov. 2000), pp. 78-83. A regular rhythm of publication saw his first book of stories, Death of a Chieftain (1964) after which the musical group The Chieftains were named, his second book of poems, A Chosen Light (1967), Tides (1970), the latter both also published by Swallow in the U.S. All during the 1960s, Montague continued to work on his long poem, The Rough Field, a task that coincided with the outbreak of the Civil Rights Movement in Northern Ireland. A Patriotic Suite appeared in 1966, Hymn to the New Omagh Road and The Bread God in 1968, and A New Siege, dedicated to Bernadette Devlin which he read outside Armagh Jail in 1970. In 1972, the long poem was finally published by Dolmen/Oxford and Montague returned to Ireland, to live and teach in University College Cork, at the request of his friend, the composer Se√°n √ì Riada, where he inspired an impressive field of young writers including Gregory O'Donoghue, Sean Dunne, Thomas McCarthy, William Wall, Maurice Riordan, Gerry Murphy, Greg Delanty and Theo Dorgan. In a birthday tribute for his 80th, William Wall wrote: \\"It would be impossible to overestimate his influence on the young writers who went to UCC (University College Cork) at that time.\\"Happy Birthday John Montague .

Montague published an anthology, The Faber Book of Irish Verse (1974) with a book of lyrics, A Slow Dance (1975). Recognition was now beginning to come, with the award of the Irish American Cultural Institute in 1976, the first Marten Toonder Award in 1977, and in 1978, the Alice Hunt Bartlett Award for The Great Cloak, \\"the best book of poetry in two years\\" according to the Poetry Society of Great Britain. A Guggenheim in 1979 and 1980 enabled Montague to complete his Selected Poems (1982) and his second long poem, The Dead Kingdom (1984) both co-published by Dolmen (Ireland), Oxford (England), Wake Forest University Press (US) and Exile Editions (Canada). In 1987, Montague was awarded an honorary doctor of letters by the State University of New York at Buffalo. Governor Mario M. Cuomo presented Montague a citation in 1987 \\"for his outstanding literary achievements and his contributions to the people of New York.\\" Montague serves as distinguished writer-in-residence for the New York State Writers Institute during each spring semester, teaching workshops in fiction and poetry and a class in the English Department of the University of Albany. In 1995, Montague and his second wife, Evelyn, separated, and he formed a partnership with American student Elizabeth Wassell (later to be author of The Honey Plain (1997)). He has 2 daughters with Evelyn, Sibyl and Oonagh. In 1998, Montague was named the first Irish professor of poetry, a three-year appointment to be divided among The Queen's University in Belfast, Trinity College Dublin, and University College Dublin. He held this title from 1998 to 2001, when he was succeeded by Nuala N√≠ Dhomhnaill. In 2008, he published A Ball of Fire, a collection of all his fiction including the short novella The Lost Notebook. =Death= Montague died at the age of 87 in Nice on 10 December 2016 after complications from a recent surgery. He is survived by his wife Elizabeth Wassell, daughters Oonagh and Sibyl and grandchildren Eve and Theo. Style Montague's poems chart boyhood, schooldays, love and relationships. Family and personal history and Ireland's history are also prominent themes in his poetry. Montague is noted for his vowel harmonies, his use of assonance and echo, and his handling of the line and line break. Montague believes that a poem appears with its own rhythm and that rhythm and line lengths should be based on living speech.

Today the property is a municipal nature park owned by the City of Orono. Big Island Park circa 1907 History Conception = The Twin Cities of Minneapolis-Saint Paul once boasted one of the most extensive streetcar systems in the United States with lines reaching 20 miles in either direction from the downtown area. At its height in the early twentieth century, lines reached the suburbs of Stillwater in the east and Tonka Bay in the west. The Twin City Rapid Transit Company (TCRT), which owned and operated the system, announced in 1905 that it had plans to construct a grand amusement park on of land that it had purchased on Lake Minnetonka's Big Island. The announcement was part of TCRT Chairman Thomas Lowry's master plan to attract tourists and excursionists to the edge of the system on summer weekends, when ridership was typically low. The company was already operating another amusement park called Wildwood near the eastern end of the system on White Bear Lake. Big Island Park opened on August 5, 1906, with construction still underway. = Amenities = A total of 10,000 or more persons typically visited Big Island Park each weekend with good weather. Since Big Island Park was located on an island, TCRT had to build three 1,000-passenger ferry boats and a transfer terminal in the town of Excelsior to efficiently carry the visitors to and from mainland. Each of the ferries were long and were double-ended so that they didn't have to turn around after each crossing. TCRT's Express Boats also provided limited service to Big Island Park, but only on rare occasions. To lodge overnight visitors, TCRT purchased the dilapidated Lake Park Hotel in Tonka Bay, renovated it, and reopened it as the Tonka Bay Hotel. TCRT had commissioned LeRoy Buffington, a prominent local architect, to design Big Island Park's structures in the Mission Revival style of architecture. Many of the park's buildings, including a light beacon modeled after the Tower of Seville, were equipped with electric lights. The light cast from the top of the beacon could purportedly be spotted from downtown Minneapolis on a clear night, approximately 15 miles away. A 1,500-seat music casino was completed in 1907 to serve as the park's premier entertainment center. Among the biggest acts to perform at the casino were the New York band and orchestra of Frederick Innes and the Banda Rossa Orchestra under the direction Eugenio Sorrentino. Most headliners, however, were local. Other attractions at Big Island Park included a roller coaster, a carousel, boat rentals, a log flume-type ride called the Old Mill, and another ride called the Scenic Ride Through Yellowstone Park. The park was also known for its fine picnic facilities. = Closure = Due to excessive operating costs and lack of revenue during the off-season, TCRT closed Big Island Park in August 1911 and abandoned the property shortly thereafter. Most of the buildings and rides were dismantled over the winter of 1917-1918. Rebar within the structures was smelted down and used for the World War I effort. = Big Island Park Today = The property was eventually sold to several veteran associations and used as a campground for nearly 80 years. The City of Orono purchased the property after the campground closed in 2003 and reopened it as a municipal nature park in 2006. Today virtually nothing of the original amusement park remains except for several foundations, a ditch that once contained the Old Mill ride, and the remains of the grand entrance, also referred to as \\"The Mall.\\" Camping and alcohol are not allowed on the premises, but picnics, hiking, and other recreational activities are encouraged. A public dock is located at the site of the original steamboat wharf. Big Island's first and only school, the Big Island Summer Institute, was established in 2006. The program was forced to relocate, however, after fire destroyed the facility in 2011.

Most of his final roles were in television. Life and career Robards was born on a farm in Hillsdale, Michigan, the son of Elizabeth (n√©e Loomis), a schoolteacher, and Frank P. Robards Sr., a farmer and post office inspector who managed Theodore Roosevelt's 1912 Presidential campaign in Michigan. He was raised in Chicago, Illinois.Jason Nelson Robards Sr. & Hope Maxine Glanville & Agnes E. __?https://archive.org/stream/playeraprofileof002609mbp/playeraprofileof002609mbp_djvu.txt He trained at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He was billed simply as \\"Jason Robards\\" through most of his career, but in his latter years, after his namesake son took up acting, he was generally listed in credits as Jason Robards Sr. He died in 1963 (after which his increasingly famous son switched from \\"Jason Robards Jr.\\" to \\"Jason Robards\\"). Contemporary actors Jason Robards III and Sam Robards are Jason Sr.'s grandsons. =Acting career= Robards Sr. in the D. W. Griffith film Abraham Lincoln (1930) Robards's film career lasted primarily from 1921 to 1961. His Broadway credits include the musical Turn To The Right (1917). After 1951, Robards's career consisted mainly of television performances, but prior to that, the Internet Movie Database lists appearances in 208 movies over a 30-year span before he spent another decade acting in various television shows and series. Robards‚Äôs best known stage role was John Marvin in the long-running hit Lightnin'. Robards's connection to the part caused his son to equate him to the character of James Tyrone in Long Day's Journey Into Night, which Jason Jr. played on Broadway in 1956 and on screen in 1962. In the play, Tyrone is an actor whose career is limited by his identification with a single part, The Count of Monte Cristo. Jason Jr. would later say \\"One of the most damaging things for me, I realize now, was playing a drunk in the play Long Day's Journey Into Night. In the play, the drunk's father is a failed artist and his mother was a drug addict. It was only after years of analysis I realized I was acting out events in my own life on stage.\\"Sheridan Morely, The Great Stage Stars. Facts On File (1986) In one of his television appearances, Robards played Judge Hesby in the 1958 episode \\"Dead Reckoning\\" of the ABC/Warner Brothers western series, Colt .45, starring Wayde Preston. Others in the guest cast were Richard Webb and Lee Van Cleef as Rocky Norton and Devery, respectively. The Robardses, father and son, acted on stage together only once, in Budd Schulberg's The Disenchanted, a play inspired by the story of F. Scott Fitzgerald. Jason Jr. won his only Tony Award for his performance. Robards Sr. died, aged 70, in Sherman Oaks, California, at his home.

History The original station, named Irlam, was opened by the Cheshire Lines Committee on 2 September 1873, on their route between Manchester Central and Liverpool Central. The station was renamed Irlam and Cadishead on 1 August 1879. The construction of the Manchester Ship Canal, which opened on 1 January 1894, required the railway line to be raised in order to provide clearance for shipping, so a new line was built parallel but at a higher level. The new line was used by goods trains from 9 January 1893, and on 26 March 1893 passenger trains were also transferred to the deviation, the original station being closed and replaced by the present station. In August 1954, the station was renamed Irlam for Cadishead, reverting to Irlam on 6 May 1974. Irlam railway station in 1988 Facilities The station is unstaffed, despite being used by over 350,000 passengers a year.

Life Born at Clairac, near Agen in the Lot-et- Garonne and raised as a Huguenot, Th√©ophile de Viau participated in the Protestant wars in Guyenne from 1615‚Äì16 in the service of the Comte de Candale. After the war, he was pardoned and became a brilliant young poet in the royal court. Th√©ophile came into contact with the epicurean ideas of Italian philosopher Lucilio Vanini, which questioned the immortality of the soul. (Vanini was accused of heresy and of practising magic, and after having his tongue cut out, was strangled and his corpse burned in Toulouse in 1619.) Because of his heretical views and his libertine lifestyle, de Viau was banished from France in 1619 and traveled in England, though he returned to the court in 1620. In 1622 a collection of licentious poems, Le Parnasse satyrique, was published under his name, although many of the poems were written by others. However, de Viau was denounced by the Jesuits in 1623 on moral charges, for his bisexuality. He was imprisoned and sentenced to appear barefoot before Notre Dame in Paris to be burned alive. While de Viau was in hiding, the sentence was carried out in effigy, but the poet was eventually caught in flight toward England and put in the Conciergerie prison in Paris for almost two years. The trial led to debates among scholars and writers, and 55 pamphlets were published both for and against de Viau. His sentence was changed to permanent banishment and de Viau spent the remaining months of his life in Chantilly under the protection of the Duke of Montmorency before dying in Paris in 1626. Writings De Viau's wrote satirical poems, sonnets, odes and elegies. His works include one play, Les Amours tragiques de Pyrame et Thisb√© (performed in 1621), the tragic love story of Pyramus and Thisbe which ends in a double suicide. He wrote Fragment d'une histoire comique (English: Fragment of a Comic Novel, 1623), in which he expressed his literary tastes. He was not a supporter of \\"the metaphoric excess and lofty erudition\\" of his contemporaries. But he also thought \\"sterile\\" the constraints proposed by would-be reformers such as Fran√ßois de Malherbe. This disregard for constraints probably added to his reputation as a non-conformist.Stedman (2012), pp. 59‚Äì61. De Viau's poetic style refused the logical and classicist constraints of Fran√ßois de Malherbe and remained attached to the emotional and the baroque images of the late Renaissance, such as in his ode Un corbeau devant moi croasse (A crow before me caws), which paints a fantastic scene of thunder, serpents and fire (much like a painting by Salvator Rosa). Two of his poems are melancholy pleas to the king on the subject of his incarceration or exile, and this tone of sadness is also present in his ode On Solitide which mixes classical motifs with an elegy about the poet in the midst of a forest. Th√©ophile de Viau was \\"rediscovered\\" by the French Romantics in the 19th century.  Depictions  He is depicted in Roberto Rossellini's film Descartes as meeting Descartes in the free-thinking salons of Paris before Descartes' departure for Holland in 1618.

It is bisected by the Termon River which is part of the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The portion of the village in Northern Ireland is officially called Tullyhommon but is locally known as 'High Street' because of its hillside position overlooking the remainder of the village. The rest of the village in the Republic includes Main Street, Mill Street and Station Street, all of which meet in The Diamond at the centre of the village. There are also two relatively modern housing estates on the northern outskirts, Termon Villas and St. Patrick's Terrace, along with new developments such as Mill Grove. Until the late 1700s, the area was known as 'An Tearmann', meaning 'a place of sanctuary'. The modern Irish (Paiteag√≥) and English (Pettigo) names derive from the Latin protectio (protection), a translation of the Irish 'An Tearmann'. Population For the purpose of data collection the Census of Ireland regards Pettigo as three separate electoral divisions, Pettigo (396), Grousehall (76) and Templecarn (128), giving a total population of 600 as of 2011.http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/census/documents/census2011vol1andprofile1/Table_6.pdf Preliminary results from the 2016 Census gives the three Electoral Divisions a total population of 590.http://airomaps.nuim.ie/id/Census2016/ Economy Once a thriving market village on the Enniskillen and Bundoran Railway, the village suffered from partition in 1922, the closure of the railway in 1957 and from the closure of numerous cross-border roads by the British Army at the height of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. The latter had the effect of cutting Pettigo off from much of its rural hinterland in counties Fermanagh and Tyrone. In recent years economic prospects have improved with the reopening of many of the cross-border roads, improving access for tourists and locals alike. Agriculture, particularly the rearing of sheep and cattle, forms the mainstay of the local economy. The quality of the local land (marshy, with much blanket bog) renders it largely unsuitable for grain crops. There are also expansive forestry plantations in the surrounding townlands, owned and operated by Coillte Teoranta, the Republic's Forestry Service. Many of the plantations occupy land unsuitable for other commercial uses, or where peat extraction has been completed, leaving poor quality thin soil cover behind. The Sitka Spruce and Lodgepole Pine softwood varieties comprise 90% of the canopy. Pettigo has traditionally been the 'gateway' to St. Patrick's Purgatory, a Christian pilgrimage site, situated on an island in Lough Derg. During the mid-late 20th century, the popularity of the pilgrimage brought a significant boost to the local economy as tens of thousands of pilgrims from all over Ireland and abroad travelled through the village on their way to and from Lough Derg. Although the popularity of the pilgrimage has dwindled in recent years, it is still an important driver of tourism in the area. History Pettigo In June 1922, at the tail end of the Irish War of Independence, Pettigo in what became the new Irish Free State, and Belleek, which was now in Northern Ireland were occupied by a 100-strong Irish Republican Army unit who had arrived there from Donegal. They were attacked first by a party of 100 Ulster Special Constabulary, who crossed Lough Erne but they were beaten off, losing one killed. Two companies of British Army troops along with 6 field guns, along with the USC, was then sent to take the villages. In the ensuing fighting, in which the British bombarded the village and then stormed it, the IRA lost three men killed, six wounded and four captured before being forced to retreat back to Donegal. One British soldier was killed in the fighting. Two civilians were also shot dead by the USC in nearby Lettercan.Robert Lynch, The Northern IRA and the early years of Partition, 1920-1922, p154-156 Other reports put the IRA casualties at seven killed and the total death toll as high as 30. A memorial was erected in 1953 to commemorate the four men who died in the invasion of Pettigo on 4 June 1922.Bureau of Military History 1913-1921 - 1952 report by men who took part in the battle. Retrieved 2013-10-01 Owing to its numerous Protestant inhabitants and awkward position astride the border, Pettigo would have been transferred to Northern Ireland had the recommendations of the Irish Boundary Commission been enacted in 1925. Religion The local area has a mixed religious composition, with the village having Roman Catholic, Church of Ireland, Presbyterian and Methodist Churches.

The railway greatly aided the movement and export of agricultural produce such as sheep and cattle and the import and distribution of coal, building materials and imported food. Livestock were loaded onto the train from the nearby Pettigo Market Yard. Both the partition of Ireland in 1922 and increasing road transport weakened the railway. The Government of Northern Ireland made the GNR close nearly all of its cross-border lines, including the Bundoran branch, on 1 October 1957.

There was escape tunnel from the castle to the belaut river. The Castle was besieged and captured during the 1641 rebellion and soon after abandoned. The castle and lands were sold to the Leslie family of Co Monaghan who controlled the Pettigo estate until the early 20th century. The Mill Pettigo Mill Pettigo Mill was built by the Leslie family who owned the Pettigo Estate. The Leslie family were originally from Monaghan town. Pettigo Mill was first on the map of Pettigo dated 1767, but probably is much older. The Mill got its power from the Termon river. It was described as a cloth mill i.e. woolen cloth, but probably also ground oats and other grains. During the famine, maize or Indian meal as it was called was ground in the Pettigo Mill. This was then sent to the poor through the port of Ballyshannon in the year 1845/1846. After the arrival of the railway in Pettigo, which opened in 1860, Pettigo Mill was a saw mill as well as a grain mill. Timber for all the usual purposes was produced but the main product that was made was egg boxes which held twelve eggs. Eggs were sent by train to the cities of Belfast and Dublin or onto England and Scotland. Egg boxes were in great demand as many people depended on their egg money to buy their groceries in the local shops. The Termon Complex A brand new community initiative by ADoPT (Association for Development of Pettigo & Tullyhommon) a Sports, leisure and entertainment complex located on the banks of the River Termon, opened in May 2014. The building project was a collaboration between the Planning & Economic Development Directorate of Donegal County Council, in partnership with Fermanagh District Council and the Association for the Development of Pettigo and Tullyhommon (ADoPT). The Termon Project has been awarded ‚Ç¨8.3 million of EU support through the PEACE III Programme. The Complex encompasses: * Different spaces within the building which will facilitate indoor sports, large meetings/conferences, drama productions & concerts - including a main hall, conference room and meeting rooms. * ADoPT offices * A purpose built Gym * An outdoor multi-use games area (MUGA) * A new playschool with secure private playground * A new public playground and community garden * Recycling space, car parking and horticultural tunnels Walks The Mountains, hills and quiet country roads offer space for hill-walking, cycling and pony trekking.

The trail entails the history and heritage of the Pettigo area. 30 plaques tell the creator of Riverdance, Moya Doherty, \\"French\\" Tom Barton, \\"Banjo\\" Patterson, the Crimean War Tree and the Pettigo Connection to \\"The Quiet Man\\" among many other tales of the areas surrounded by lakes. Pettigo Post Office. Lakes/angling Lying between Lough Erne and Lough Derg, Pettigo is able to offer the visiting angler a full range of fishing opportunities. With over fifty lakes; salmon and native brown trout will keep the game angler happy while the coarse angler will find specimen fish in Drumgun Lough. Fishing permits and boat hire is available from Brittons Bar which is located in the village. Lough Derg Lough Derg, the biggest of the Pettigo lakes, is famous throughout the northwest for its trout-fishing. Covering 2,200 acres with a shore line of 13 miles, it offers opportunities for both boat and shore angling. It also offers excellent pike fishing. Lough Derg lies about four miles north of the village of Pettigo in County Donegal. Station Island, the location of the Lough Derg Pilgrimage, is often referred to as Saint Patrick's Purgatory or simply Lough Derg. This small lake-island, renowned in Irish Christian tradition since the time of St. Patrick, has been receiving pilgrims continuously for well over 1000 years. In earlier times the area around the lake was a place of protection for anyone in trouble. The monastery nearby offered hospitality to all.

The network was acquired by Hearst Media on December 31, 2006. The original eCRUSH site was opened on Valentine's Day, 1999 in Chicago by Clark Benson and Karen DeMars Pillsbury. It pre-dated social networking sites such as Friendster.com, MySpace.com and Facebook.com.  eSPIN  eSPIN was a spin the bottle-like social networking service backed by a matchmaking engine. Users would \\"spin the bottle\\" to find other users (although they could also search); the site also had quizzes. Registration was free, however, one had to pay a monthly fee or unlock various tools via sponsors to do key processes like chatting or sending messages. The New York Times cited that eSPIN had registered more than 3.8 million users as of January 2007. ComScore Media Metrix measured their monthly unique visitors at 1,514,000 and monthly page views at 133MM (December 2008). =Age restrictions= eSPIN prohibited minors from contacting adults and vice versa, and their administrators screened user-submitted content before it was made public. Additionally, minors were prohibited from publicly posting contact information like email addresses and screen names.  eCRUSH  eCRUSH.com was a teen-oriented anonymous matching site designed to obviate fears of unrequited love. A user created a list of people he was interested in, and had the option of sending anonymous emails to those individuals indicating that an unidentified person had a crush on them. The recipient could then log on to the site and create a list of people they were interested in. If the two people selected each other, then the system notified them of the match. This system is a type of viral marketing in which awareness of the site spreads among friends and acquaintances similarly to a virus as they list each other as crushes and send emails. Other aspects of eCRUSHDemographics= In accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, eCRUSH shut down the existing accounts of children who identified themselves as being under thirteen. According to a Red Herring article, \\"eCRUSHONLINE.com is seizing an elusive but highly desirable audience of young, mostly female viewers, ranging in age from 10 to 37.\\" According to that article, the service saw its biggest growth at high schools and colleges. =The \\"Don't Be An Idiot\\" Campaign= In January 2009, eSPIN began the \\"Don't Be An Idiot\\" campaign to educate teens about online safety. The campaign consisted of a safety hub page, a safety quiz, a YouTube video and a place to submit safety stories. =Spam related issues= The company's emails promised, \\"At eCRUSH, we know how important your love life is to you, and we would never take advantage of your emotions just to spam your crush.\\" However, an April 22, 1999 article in Ohio University's The Post argued, \\"It is rare to be matched up with your one and only by trickery or bizarre circumstance. When eCRUSH's initial e-mail is sent, the recipient might discard it like a chain letter or an invitation to a porn site\\".Elig, Jenny and Harvilla, Rob: The \\"Someone has an eCRUSH on you\\" emails did not list the name of anyone the friend knows; therefore, a recipient unfamiliar with eCRUSH could very well interpret them as spam. Moreover, as with many commercial emails, eCRUSH's messages contained images that, for privacy reasons, would be peremptorily blocked by most modern email clients ‚Äì another red flag suggesting spam to many users. Lastly, the email subject lines ‚Äì for example, \\"Someone you know likes you!\\" ‚Äî resembled those employed in mass mailings from other dating sites. =Deactivation of Websites= On August 1, 2011, the entire eCRUSH/eSPIN network was deactivated by Hearst Digital Media, and all eCRUSH- related domains began redirecting to a Seventeen.com-hosted landing page.

It appears on their 1984 double album Double Nickels on the Dime, and was composed by their lead singer and guitarist D. Boon. Background Boon composed the song after a dispute with the boss of an auto parts store where he was employed. According to Michael Azerrad's book Our Band Could Be Your Life, Boon wanted to put a Los Angeles-area jazz/soul station on the radio, but his boss prevented him from doing so, calling the station's playlist \\"nigger shit\\". He was disgusted enough in his boss's attitude ‚Äì as reflected in the lyric, \\"Hey mister, don't look down on me/For what I believe\\"' ‚Äì to want to quit the job on the spot, but he needed the income at the time. So, as Azerrad put it in Our Band Could Be Your Life, \\"his frustration fueled a Minutemen classic.\\" An early version of the song as heard on a live video shot in 1983 and released by Flipside magazine has Boon mentioning his boss by name; he later changed the lyric prior to recording the song for Double Nickels on the Dime. Video \\"This Ain't No Picnic\\" was tapped to be Minutemen's first ever music video, directed by Randall Jahnson and shot in black and white for $450. The \\"plot\\" has the Minutemen singing the song in a barren field that is about to be bombed by then-president Ronald Reagan (as seen in clips from a public domain war film he starred in). The video earned some airplay on MTV and was also featured on their first-ever MTV Video Music Awards show in 1985. The video is included as one of the DVD bonus features of We Jam Econo, a full- length Minutemen documentary. Live performances A popular live favorite during Minutemen's lifetime (it topped fan balloting when Minutemen were planning a live album that became, after Boon's death, the live compilation album Ballot Result), bassist Mike Watt revived the song for live performance in 2003 at the instigation of his Secondmen organist Pete Mazich. It became a permanent part of Watt and the Secondmen's live set for their 2004 fall tour.

He was later the Abbot of Fossanova Abbey. He was a familiar of Cardinal Roderic Llan√ßol i de Borja, who later became Pope Alexander VI. On February 19, 1479, he was elected Bishop of Agrigento. Pope Sixtus IV confirmed his election on March 20, 1479, and Castro subsequently occupied this see until his death. He attended the papal conclave of 1484 as a custodian. Following the papal conclave of 1492, the new pope, Alexander VI, made Castro prefect of the Castel Sant'Angelo. Pope Alexander VI made him a cardinal priest in the consistory of February 19, 1496. He received the red hat and the titular church of Santa Prisca on February 24, 1496.

The phrase came into common use in the late 1970s or early 1980s. History Bartenders at Eddie Rickenbackers fern bar with Tiffany lamps and motorcycle tire on ceiling The first fern bar was the original T.G.I. Friday's on the corner of 63rd Street and First Avenue in a neighborhood on the Upper East Side of New York City, where many single young women lived. The founder, Alan Stillman, with a few thousand dollars borrowed from his mother, leased a saloon and remodeled it, converting the ambience to one attractive to young women. It opened March 15, 1965, and was soon copied by other restaurants in the neighborhood. Another restaurant frequently credited as the world's first fern bar, not to mention the birthplace of the Lemon Drop martini, was Henry Africa's in San Francisco, California. The bar was started in 1969 at Broadway and Polk Streets by out- of-work veteran Norman Hobday, who by his own account \\"took the opium-den atmosphere out of the saloons\\" in favor of \\"antique lamps and Grandma's living-room furniture.\\" By some accounts Hobday copied the concept from another restaurant, Perry's, which opened several months earlier and was made famous as a singles \\"meat market\\" by Armistead Maupin's novel, Tales of the City. Hobday closed the establishment in 1986, and opened up Eddie Rickenbackers, another eclectic bar, the next year. Description Typical drinks served included wine spritzers, Lemon Drop Martinis, frozen daiquir√≠s, Harvey Wallbangers, and pi√±a coladas. Franchises sometimes labeled \\"fern bars\\" include T.G.I. Friday's, Bennigan's, and Houlihan's. Fern bars were gathering places for well-dressed \\"upscale\\" young men and women, initially during the sexual revolution of the 1970s and later the yuppie era of the 1980s. Fern bars were frequently talked of disparagingly as singles bars where individuals would go to hit on men or women for sexual hookups. This image was common in the 1980s despite the fact that many people attended these bars for after-work occasions, parties or in groups.

Pietro Santi Bartoli (also Sante or Santo; 1635 - 7 November 1700) was an Italian engraver, draughtsman and painter. Life and career Illustration to the review of Picturae antiquae cryptarum romanarum published in Acta Eruditorum, 1708 Illustration to the review of Le antiche lucerne sepolcrali figurate published in Acta Eruditorum, 1692 Bartoli was born at Perugia. He moved to Rome in 1635 as a youth, there he studied painting under Jean Lemaire and Poussin, but abandoned it to devote himself entirely to engraving and as an antiquarian for Christina, Queen of Sweden. He engraved many Roman monuments, publishing in Admiranda Romanorum Antiquitatum (Rome, 1693). About 1660, he excavated the Domus Aurea, of which he published drawings. As a draughtsman, Bartoli reproduced the Codice Virgiliano (Rome, Vatican, Bib. Apostolica, Cod. Vat. 3867) in 55 plates (1677; Rome, Calcografia N.), commissioned by Cardinal Camillo Massimo. For Massimo, he also did drawings of ancient Roman paintings and mosaics (Glasgow, U. Lib.). Later, he lived in Paris, where he was introduced at the court of Louis XIV. In 1699, with the engraver Domenico de' Rossi, he produced Romanae Magnitudinis Monumenta, a later edition of the 1637 Antiquae Urbis Splendor by Giacomo Lauro.

On October 24, 2012, Rural TV purchased FamilyNet, and the transaction took effect on January 1, 2013. At first the network was used to carry an all-trading day format of farm and market news, which eventually moved to a reduced timeslot on RFD-TV due to low interest and ratings. Rural Media, which had considered merging RFD-TV and FamilyNet together to gain over-the-air carriage, eventually decided to keep FamilyNet as a separate service, but with a refocus in programming towards classic television programming which was not picked up by competitors MeTV, Antenna TV and Cozi TV. Rural Media also decided not to renew over-the-air contracts with stations in a slow process in order to make it a cable-only network. A number of former FamilyNet affiliates (mainly religious stations) continue to carry programming recorded from the network's feed before the Rural TV sale, seemingly under a perpetual license. In September 2014, FamilyNet was refocused with classic television series and films from the Sony Pictures Television libraries, with Sony also assisting with advertising sales. Religious programming, which used to make up the vast majority of the schedule under SBC and Schuller's ownership, was limited to Sunday mornings, though Rural Media also maintained FamilyNet's paid programming overnights despite their executives' traditional disdain for depending on those programs for revenue (RFD-TV since also began to carry overnight paid programming). =As The Cowboy Channel= On June 19, 2017, Rural Media Group CEO Patrick Gottsch announced that on July 1, FamilyNet would be rebranded as The Cowboy Channel, featuring a focus on Western sports and rodeo events, which had proven to be a popular attraction on RFD-TV. Gottsch thanked Sony Pictures Television for bringing the network to a solid footing, but noted that overwhelming competition in the classic television space from networks such as MeTV, Antenna TV, Cozi TV, Heroes & Icons and several other networks and streaming options had made the space more competitive and crowded, while a Western sports network was seen as a unique opportunity to stand out in cable and satellite lineups. Among the network's first offerings will be encore events from RFD's The American Rodeo, the Calgary Stampede, and the Professional Bull Riders archives. Sony's archived programming thus moved to their own GetTV at the start of 2018. The Cowboy Channel signed a multi-year agreement with the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association to televise their major events, including the National Finals Rodeo, starting in 2020. With the network conversion, Rural Media used the opportunity to end their carriage agreements with over-the-air broadcasters, rendering the Cowboy Channel as a pay-TV only offering. A Canadian version of the channel was launched on February 1, 2020 on Shaw Direct television systems through a partnership with Rural Media. Programming Much of the Cowboy Channel's non-sports programming is drawn from RFD-TV's program library, with an emphasis on ranching and rodeo programs (thus the Cowboy Channel does not carry RFD-TV's music, agribusiness or news programming). Like RFD-TV, the Cowboy Channel carries brokered televangelism programming on Sunday mornings. =Current programming= * Best of America By Horseback * Debbe Dunning's Dude Ranch Roundup * Chris Cox Horsemanship * Cinch High School Rodeo Tour * Cowboy Country TV * Gentle Giants * Honky Tonk Ranch * Little Britches Rodeo * Out There with Baxter Black * Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association * RanchHer * Red Steagall is Somewhere West of Wall Street * Ride Smart * Rodeo New York * The American Rancher * The Cowboys' Kitchen * Western Sports Roundup * Western Trading Post * Wild Spayed Filly Futurity * Your Life Redefined Reruns *The Lone Ranger *The Roy Rogers Show ReferencesExternal links * *National Finals Rodeo on The Cowboy Channel Category:Television networks in the United States Category:Sports television networks in the United States Category:Companies based in Omaha, Nebraska Category:Companies based in Nashville, Tennessee Category:Television channels and stations established in 1979 ","title":"The Cowboy Channel"},{"id":"2738852","text":"Trafford Park railway station is in Stretford, close to the border of Trafford Park in the Trafford Metropolitan Borough of Greater Manchester in the North West of England.

Traditionally considered to be the oldest church in the city, St. Rupert's Church is dedicated to Saint Rupert of Salzburg, patron saint of the salt merchants of Vienna. The church is located in one of the oldest parts of the city, the section of the Roman Vindobona.Brook 2012, p. 81. There is currently some debate whether the Ruprechtskirche is truly the oldest church in Vienna. Discoveries of old foundations under the St. Peter's Church and old graves under the St. Stephen's Cathedral have disputed the certainty of this label. History According to legend, it was founded by Cunald and Gisalrich, companions of Rupert during his occupation of the seat of bishop of Salzburg. However, because Salzburg had influence over religious issues in Vienna between 796 and 829, it is more probable that it was founded in this period. The first reference in historical documentation is in a document of 1200 when Duke Heinrich II Jasomirgott describes a gift to the Schottenstift church. The document also mentions the Ruprechtskirche, which is labeled the oldest in the city. After the destruction of the Roman settlement, the core part of the city grew in the area near the church. It was the seat of the religious administration before that function was transferred to the Stephansdom in 1147. During the Middle Ages, the church was the seat of the Salt Office (Salzamt), which distributed salt to individual buyers and ensured its quality. The church overlooks the jetty of the salt merchants on the Danube channel. The ivy-covered church has been rebuilt and altered many times in its history. In 1276, it was damaged by fire and modified. The choir dates from the 13th century, while the southern nave dates from the 15th century. In 1622, it was redecorated in Baroque style. It was also somewhat damaged by shellfire during World War II and affected by the demolition of the nearby ruins of another building. In the middle of the apse, there are two Romanesque stained-glass windows. Other features The oldest bells in Vienna are located in the church, dating from around 1280. The oldest glass window panes (dating from approximately 1370) can be found in the church. They depict a crucified Christ and the Madonna with baby. A statue of Saint Rupert is located in the north part of the main tower. The arch on the western gallery has a plaque with the label ‚ÄúAEIOU 1439‚Äù, an undecyphered motto of Emperor Frederick III. The plaque was designed to commemorate the entrance of the emperor to Vienna on December 6, 1439. According to tradition, AEIOU stands for (in Latin) \\"AUSTRIAE EST IMPERARE ORBI UNIVERSO\\" or in German \\"ALLES ERDREICH IST OESTERREICH UNTERTAN\\", both meaning \\"The whole world is subject to Austria\\" A relic of the sarcophagus of Saint Vitalis is located in the church containing the remains of a claimed Christian victim from the Roman catacombs. This memorial of victimization has special meaning in modern times because the Gestapo headquarters, which was used for torture and the organization of Jewish deportations, was located nearby in the Morzinplatz square.

It contains about 8,800 words. It describes the dream-journey of a devout Zoroastrian (the Wƒ´rƒÅz of the story) through the next world. The text assumed its definitive form in the 9th-10th centuries after a long series of emendations. Title The full title is ArdƒÅ Wƒ´rƒÅz nƒÅmag, \\"Book of the Just Wƒ´rƒÅz\\". Due to the ambiguity inherent to Pahlavi scripts (the Pahlavi script have considerable ambiguity in the pronunciation of certain consonants), Wƒ´rƒÅz, the name of the protagonist, may also be transliterated as Wiraf or Viraf, but the Avestan form is clearly VirƒÅza, suggesting the correct reading is z. The ArdƒÅ of the name (cf. a≈°a, cognate with Sanskrit ·πõta) is an epithet of Wƒ´rƒÅz and is approximately translatable as \\"truthful, righteous, just.\\" Wƒ´rƒÅz is probably akin to Proto-Indo-European *wiHro--, \\"man\\", see Skt. vƒ´ra. Finally, NƒÅmag means \\"book\\". Textual history The date of the book is not known, but in The Sacred Books and Early Literature of the East, Prof. Charles Horne assumes that it was composed fairly late in the ancient history of Zoroastrianism, probably from the period of the Sasanian Empire (from 224 to 651), when Zoroastrianism experienced a state-sponsored revival. Most modern scholars simply state that the text's terminus ad quem was the 10th or 11th century. Plot summary Wƒ´rƒÅz is chosen for his piety to undertake a journey to the next world in order to prove the truth of Zoroastrian beliefs, after a period when the land of Iran had been troubled by the presence of confused and alien religions. He drinks a mixture of wine, mang, and Haoma, after which his soul travels to the next world. Here he is greeted by a beautiful woman named Dƒìn, who represents his faith and virtue. Crossing the Chinvat Bridge, he is then conducted by \\"Srosh, the pious and Adar, the yazad\\" through the \\"star track\\", \\"moon track\\" and \\"sun track\\" - places outside of heaven reserved for the virtuous who have nevertheless failed to conform to Zoroastrian rules. In heaven, Wƒ´rƒÅz meets Ahura Mazda who shows him the souls of the blessed (ahlaw, an alternate Middle Persian version of the word ardƒÅ). Each person is described living an idealised version of the life he or she lived on earth, as a warrior, agriculturalist, shepherd or other profession.http://www.avesta.org/pahlavi/viraf.html Translation of the Book of Arda Viraf With his guides he then descends into hell to be shown the sufferings of the wicked. Having completed his visionary journey, Wƒ´rƒÅz is told by Ahura Mazda that the Zoroastrian faith is the only proper and true way of life and that it should be preserved in both prosperity and adversity. Quotes from the text *They say that, once upon a time, the pious Zartosht made the religion, which he had received, current in the world; and till the completion of 300 years, the religion was in purity, and men were without doubts.

Bounds, was an American author, attorney, and member of the Methodist Episcopal Church South clergy. He is known for writing 11 books, nine of which focused on the subject of prayer. Only two of Bounds' books were published before he died. After his death, Rev. Claudius (Claude) Lysias Chilton, Jr., grandson of William Parish Chilton and admirer of Bounds, worked on preserving and preparing Bounds' collection of manuscripts for publication. By 1921, Homer W. Hodge completed additional editorial work.  Early life  Edward McKendree Bounds was born on August 15, 1835, in Shelbyville, Missouri. He is the son of Thomas Jefferson and Hester A. (n√©e Purnell) Bounds.Bounds on Prayer 2006, pages viii‚Äìxiv In the preface to E.M. Bounds on Prayer, published by Hendrickson Christian Classics Series over 90 years after Bounds' death, it is surmised that young Edward was named after the evangelist, William McKendree, who planted churches in western Missouri and served as the fourth bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church. He was the fifth child, in a family of three sons and three daughters. Thomas Jefferson Bounds was one of the original settlers of Shelby County. Prior to organizing the County, Thomas Bounds served as the first Justice of the Peace. In April 1835, he was named County Clerk, followed by an appointment to serve as the County Commissioner in December 1835. In 1836, he began holding circuit court in his home, during the third term each year. In his capacity as County Commissioner, he platted the town into blocks and lots for new settlers. In 1840, he advanced the building of the First Methodist Church. In 1849, Thomas contracted tuberculosis and died.Complete Works 2000, page 9‚Äì10Failed Ambition 2004, pages 85‚Äì87 After his father's death, 14-year-old Bounds joined several other relatives in a trek to Mesquite Canyon in California, following the discovery of gold in the area. After four unsuccessful years, they returned to Missouri. Bounds studied law in Hannibal, Missouri, after which, at age 19, he became the youngest practicing lawyer in the state of Missouri. Although apprenticed as an attorney, Bounds felt called to Christian ministry in his early twenties during the Third Great Awakening. Following a brush arbor revival meeting led by Evangelist Smith Thomas, he closed his law office and moved to Palmyra, Missouri to enroll in the Centenary Seminary. Two years later, in 1859 at the age of 24, he was ordained by his denomination and was named pastor of the nearby Monticello, Missouri Methodist Church. =Marriage and children= Bounds' first marriage was to Emma (Emmie) Elizabeth Barnett from Washington, Georgia on September 19, 1876. They had two daughters, Celeste and Corneille, and a son, Edward. Emmie died on February 18, 1886. Twenty months later, Edward married Emmie's cousin, Harriet (Hattie) Elizabeth Barnett in 1887. To them were born three sons (Samuel, Charles, and Osborne) and three daughters (Elizabeth, Mary, and Emmie). His son Edward, by his first wife, died at the age of six, and his son Charles, by his second wife, died eight days after his first birthday. =Military service= E.M. Bounds did not support slavery. But, because he was a pastor at a congregation in the recently formed Methodist Episcopal Church South, his name was included in a list of 250 names who were to take an oath of allegiance and post a $500 bond. Edward saw no reason for a U.S. Citizen to take such an oath, he was morally opposed to the Union raising funds in this way, and he didn't have the $500. Bounds and the others on the list were arrested in 1861 by Union troops, and Bounds was charged as a Confederate sympathizer. He was held with other non-combatants in a Federal prison in St. Louis for a year and a half. He was then transferred to Memphis and released in a prisoner exchange between the Union and the Confederacy. He became a chaplain in the Confederate States Army (3rd Missouri Infantry CSA). During the Second Battle of Franklin, Bounds suffered a severe forehead injury from a Union saber, and he was taken prisoner. On June 28, 1865, Bounds was among Confederate prisoners who were released upon the taking of an oath of loyalty to the United States. =Pastoral service= Upon his release as a prisoner of the Union Army, he felt compelled to return to war- torn Franklin and help rebuild it spiritually, and he became the pastor of the Franklin Methodist Episcopal Church, South. His primary method was to establish weekly prayer sessions that sometimes lasted several hours. Bounds was regionally celebrated for leading spiritual revival in Franklin and eventually began an itinerant preaching ministry throughout the country. After serving several important churches in St. Louis and other places, south, he became Editor of the St. Louis Christian Advocate for eight years and, later, Associate Editor of The Nashville Christian Advocate for four years. The trial of his faith came to him while in Nashville, and he quietly retired to his home without asking even a pension. His principal work in Washington, Georgia (his home) was rising at 4 am and praying until 7 am. He filled a few engagements as an evangelist during the eighteen years of his lifework. \\"While on speaking engagements, he would not neglect his early morning time in prayer, and cared nothing for the protests of the other occupants of his room at being awakened so early. No man could have made more melting appeals for lost souls and backslidden ministers than did Bounds. Tears ran down his face as he pleaded for us all in that room.\\"Heaven 1921, pages 5‚Äì6 According to people who were constantly with him, in prayer and preaching, for eight years \\"Not a foolish word did we ever hear him utter. He was one of the most intense eagles of God that ever penetrated the spiritual ether. He could not brook delay in rising, or being late for dinner. He would go with me to street meetings often in Brooklyn and listen to the preaching and sing with us those beautiful songs of Wesley and Watts. He often reprimanded me for asking the unconverted to sing of Heaven. Said he: 'They have no heart to sing, they do not know God, and God does not hear them. Quit asking sinners to sing the songs of Zion and the Lamb.'\\" Theology In his writings, Bound adopted soteriological views which follow with some details, the Arminian orthodoxy.  Writing background  Only two of Bounds' books were published before he died. After his death, Rev. Claudius (Claude) Lysias Chilton, Jr., grandson of William Parish Chilton and admirer of Bounds, worked on preserving and preparing Bounds' collection of manuscripts for publication. By 1921, more editorial work had been done by Rev. Homer W. Hodge. Chilton said of Bounds' books, \\"These books are unfailing wells for a lifetime of spiritual water- drawing. They are hidden treasures, wrought in the darkness of dawn and the heat of the noon, on the anvil of experience,and beaten into wondrous form by the mighty stroke of the divine. They are living voices whereby he, being dead, yet speaketh!\\"Necessity 2009, foreword  Published works  * Preacher and Prayer (1907) * The Resurrection (1907, republished in 1921 as Ineffable Glory: Thoughts on the Resurrection) * Power Through Prayer (1910) * Purpose in Prayer (1920) * Prayer and Praying Men (1921) * Heaven: A Place‚ÄîA City‚ÄîA Home (1921) * Satan: His Personality, Power and Overthrow (1922) * The Possibilities of Prayer (1923) * The Reality of Prayer (1924) * The Essentials of Prayer (1925) * The Necessity of Prayer (1929) * The Weapon of Prayer (1931)  Notes and references Citations Sources = * Bounds, E.M.

He completed his military career at the rank of Lieutenant General.  Life  He was an illegitimate son of Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia and a French actress. Konstantinov graduated from Mikhailovskoye Artillery School in St. Petersburg in 1836. In 1844, he invented a device for measuring the flight speed of projectiles at any point of their trajectory. In 1847 Konstantinov created a ballistic rocket pendulum, which would allow to establish a law of changing rocket motion in time. With the help of this device, he was able to determine the influence of the form and design of a rocket on its ballistic characteristics, thereby laying the foundations for calculated rocket designs. In 1849 he was appointed commander of the Petersburg Rocketry Department (–ü–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–±—É—Ä–≥—Å–∫–æ–µ —Ä–∞–∫–µ—Ç–Ω–æ–µ –∑–∞–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ). In 1861, he supervised the construction of a rocket factory in Nikolayev, which he would head six years later. Konstantinov is known to have created structurally perfect missiles (for the 19th century) with a range of 4 to 5 km, launch pads, and rocket-making machines. He authored a number of works on rocket science, artillery, firearms, pyrotechnics, and aeronautics. A crater on the far side of the Moon is named after him.

The reservoir does not connect directly to the main reticulation system; rather, to maintain levels at Clarendon Weir, water is released only as required. Much of the water from Mount Bold will eventually end up at Happy Valley Reservoir and used to supply parts of the Mount Lofty Ranges and also Adelaide. A major renovation was completed in 1964 when the level of the dam was raised 6.4 metres to increase the reservoir's capacity by approximately 17,000 megalitres. Although originally supplying its own electricity through a small hydro-electricity plant, this was discontinued in 1961. However, Mount Bold is now considered a possible site for a future commercial mini-hydro generator. In early June 2007, the South Australian Government began a scoping study into expanding the reservoir's capacity fivefold to 240 gigalitres at an estimated cost of A$850 million.\\"SA plan to boost water storage capacity\\", ABC News Online, 5 June 2007.

The resulting water flushed out the Onkaparinga Catchment, causing several flooded roads but removing debris which had been building up for many years.\\" Mt Bold reservoir reaches capacity\\", Adelaide Now - News.com, 26 September 2009.

The company‚Äôs cymbal production is one of the \\"big four\\" manufacturers of cymbals, along with Zildjian, Sabian, and Paiste. In addition to cymbals, Meinl manufactures a very wide range of percussion instruments including bongo drums, cajons, congas, djembes, g√ºiros, pandeiros, and tambourines.  History  The \\"Roland Meinl Musikinstrumente\\" was founded in 1951 by Roland Meinl. Initially the company produced wind instruments, beginning the production of cymbals only in 1952. The first Meinl cymbals were cut out of large metal sheets, hammered, lathed and drilled by hand by Roland Meinl himself, who subsequently transported them to the Neustadt an der Aisch railstation on the luggage carrier of his bike. In the 1960s about half of the production was exported to the United States together with German-made Tromsa drumsets. The first employee, Gustav Strobel, was hired in 1964 and worked for the company for almost 40 years. At about the same time Roland Meinl began to import affordable music instruments from Japan, being one of the first Pearl importers in Europe. He later began to import Tama and Ibanez instruments.Brief company history (Version May 6, 2006 from Internet Archive) In 1974 Meinl was the first cymbal company to offer pre-pack cymbal sets. Meinl's initial cymbal production focused on low-budget cymbals, and it wasn't until 1984 with the \\"Profile Series\\" that Meinl started to really focus on professional-level cymbals. The first Meinl pro series was the \\"King-Beat Series\\", introduced in 1976. In 1990 Meinl introduced the \\"Tri-Tonal Series\\", their first signature series developed with Billy Cobham. The series was discontinued a year later. In 2006 Meinl began the production of the \\"Mb10 Series\\", made out of B10 bronze alloy (90% copper and 10% tin), making them the only company to produce cymbals out of four different bronze alloys (B8, B10, B12 and B20 bronze). On December 4, 2007 company founder Roland Meinl died at the age of 78. ProductsCymbals=Current cymbal series * Byzance ‚Äì Professional cymbals which produce more traditional sounds. They are made out of the B20 alloy and are hand hammered in Turkey. Available in eight variations: ** Byzance Traditional ‚Äì These cymbals are said to be warm and versatile, with a traditional sound. They come in a traditional finish. ** Byzance Dark ‚Äì These cymbals feature a dark and earthy tone with a good stick definition. The surface of these cymbals is untreated and extensively hammered. ** Byzance Brilliant ‚Äì This series owes its name to its brilliant finish. The finish gives these cymbals a darker sound compared to the Byzance Traditional series, since it limits the high end. ** Byzance Jazz ‚Äì The cymbals from this line have a dark and tonally complex sound. They come in a traditional finish. ** Byzance Extra Dry ‚Äì As the name suggests, these cymbals are very dry, low-pitched and trashy. The cymbals of this series are deeply hand-hammered and feature an unlathed, raw top and a traditionally lathed bottom. ** Byzance Vintage ‚Äì They feature a dry, low-pitched controlled sound. Most of the cymbals of this line come in a unique sandblasted finish. ** Byzance Dual ‚Äì Initially part of the Byzance Extra Dry series, these cymbals feature an unlathed, raw inner bow and bell area and a brilliant outer edge, giving the cymbal two playing surfaces for riding and crashing. ** Byzance Foundry Reserve ‚Äì Limited selection of high end, hand hammered B20 cymbals with a complex, dark character and a clear stick definition. These cymbals are sold with a pair of drum sticks, a pair of cotton gloves and a certificate. * Pure Alloy ‚Äì Professional level cymbals made from proprietary \\"Pure Alloy\\" bronze. This series features pinpoint lathing and a traditional finish. ** Pure Alloy Custom ‚Äì Professional level cymbals made from proprietary \\"Pure Alloy\\" bronze.

A number of alloys are used for this series such as the FX9 alloy (69% copper, 15% zinc, 15% manganese, 1% aluminium), MS63 brass, B12 bronze and B8 bronze. * Classics Custom ‚Äì Made from B10 bronze alloy, these semi-professional level cymbals are bright and loud. They come in a brilliant finish. ** Classics Custom Dark ‚Äì These cymbals are darker and more complex in tone compared to the regular Classics Customs due to their finishing, deep hammering and additional lathing. The peculiar finish gives this cymbal a unique dark look. ** Classics Custom Extreme Metal ‚Äì These cymbals are deeply machine hammered and they have a bright and penetrating sound designed for heavier music. * HCS ‚Äì Beginner/Entry-level cymbals made from a MS63 brass alloy (63% copper, 37% zinc).
