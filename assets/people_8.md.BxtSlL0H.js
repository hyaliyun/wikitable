Parameterization In cylindrical coordinates, the conchospiral is described by the parametric equations: :r=\\\\mu^t a :\\\\theta=t :z=\\\\mu^t c. The projection of a conchospiral on the (r,\\\\theta) plane is a logarithmic spiral. The parameter \\\\mu controls the opening angle of the projected spiral, while the parameter c controls the slope of the cone on which the curve lies. History The name \\"conchospiral\\" was given to these curves by 19th-century German mineralogist Georg Amadeus Carl Friedrich Naumann, in his study of the shapes of sea shells. Applications The conchospiral has been used in the design for radio antennas. In this application, it has the advantage of producing a radio beam in a single direction, towards the apex of the cone.

Intuitively, let f : D ‚Üí D‚Ä≤ be an orientation-preserving homeomorphism between open sets in the plane. If f is continuously differentiable, then it is K-quasiconformal if the derivative of f at every point maps circles to ellipses with eccentricity bounded by K. Definition Suppose f : D ‚Üí D‚Ä≤ where D and D‚Ä≤ are two domains in C. There are a variety of equivalent definitions, depending on the required smoothness of f. If f is assumed to have continuous partial derivatives, then f is quasiconformal provided it satisfies the Beltrami equation = \\\\mu(z)\\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial z},}} for some complex valued Lebesgue measurable Œº satisfying sup Œº < 1 . This equation admits a geometrical interpretation. Equip D with the metric tensor :ds^2 = \\\\Omega(z)^2\\\\left \\\\, dz + \\\\mu(z) \\\\, d\\\\bar{z}\\\\right^2, where Œ©(z) > 0\\\\. Then f satisfies () precisely when it is a conformal transformation from D equipped with this metric to the domain D‚Ä≤ equipped with the standard Euclidean metric. The function f is then called Œº-conformal. More generally, the continuous differentiability of f can be replaced by the weaker condition that f be in the Sobolev space W1,2(D) of functions whose first-order distributional derivatives are in L2(D). In this case, f is required to be a weak solution of (). When Œº is zero almost everywhere, any homeomorphism in W1,2(D) that is a weak solution of () is conformal. Without appeal to an auxiliary metric, consider the effect of the pullback under f of the usual Euclidean metric. The resulting metric is then given by :\\\\left\\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial z}\\\\right^2\\\\left\\\\,dz+\\\\mu(z)\\\\,d\\\\bar{z}\\\\right^2 which, relative to the background Euclidean metric dz d\\\\bar{z}, has eigenvalues :(1+\\\\mu)^2\\\\textstyle{\\\\left\\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial z}\\\\right^2},\\\\qquad (1-\\\\mu)^2\\\\textstyle{\\\\left\\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial z}\\\\right^2}. The eigenvalues represent, respectively, the squared length of the major and minor axis of the ellipse obtained by pulling back along f the unit circle in the tangent plane. Accordingly, the dilatation of f at a point z is defined by :K(z) = \\\\frac{1+\\\\mu(z)}{1-\\\\mu(z)}. The (essential) supremum of K(z) is given by :K = \\\\sup_{z\\\\in D} K(z) = \\\\frac{1+\\\\\\\\mu\\\\_\\\\infty}{1-\\\\\\\\mu\\\\_\\\\infty} and is called the dilatation of f. A definition based on the notion of extremal length is as follows. If there is a finite K such that for every collection Œì of curves in D the extremal length of Œì is at most K times the extremal length of {f o Œ≥ : Œ≥ ‚àà Œì}. Then f is K-quasiconformal. If f is K-quasiconformal for some finite K, then f is quasiconformal. A few facts about quasiconformal mappings If K > 1 then the maps x + iy ‚Ü¶ Kx + iy and x + iy ‚Ü¶ x + iKy are both quasiconformal and have constant dilatation K. If s > ‚àí1 then the map z\\\\mapsto z\\\\,z^{s} is quasiconformal (here z is a complex number) and has constant dilatation \\\\max(1+s, \\\\frac{1}{1+s}). When s ‚â† 0, this is an example of a quasiconformal homeomorphism that is not smooth. If s = 0, this is simply the identity map. A homeomorphism is 1-quasiconformal if and only if it is conformal. Hence the identity map is always 1-quasiconformal. If f : D ‚Üí D‚Ä≤ is K-quasiconformal and g : D‚Ä≤ ‚Üí D‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ is K‚Ä≤-quasiconformal, then g o f is KK‚Ä≤-quasiconformal. The inverse of a K-quasiconformal homeomorphism is K-quasiconformal. The set of 1-quasiconformal maps forms a group under composition. The space of K-quasiconformal mappings from the complex plane to itself mapping three distinct points to three given points is compact. Measurable Riemann mapping theorem Of central importance in the theory of quasiconformal mappings in two dimensions is the measurable Riemann mapping theorem, proved by Lars Ahlfors and Lipman Bers. The theorem generalizes the Riemann mapping theorem from conformal to quasiconformal homeomorphisms, and is stated as follows. Suppose that D is a simply connected domain in C that is not equal to C, and suppose that Œº : D ‚Üí C is Lebesgue measurable and satisfies \\\\\\\\mu\\\\_\\\\infty<1. Then there is a quasiconformal homeomorphism f from D to the unit disk which is in the Sobolev space W1,2(D) and satisfies the corresponding Beltrami equation () in the distributional sense. As with Riemann's mapping theorem, this f is unique up to 3 real parameters. n-dimensional generalizationComputational quasi-conformal geometry Recently, quasi-conformal geometry has attracted attention from different fields, such as applied mathematics, computer vision and medical imaging. Computational quasi-conformal geometry has been developed, which extends the quasi-conformal theory into a discrete setting. It has found various important applications in medical image analysis, computer vision and graphics.

The name N√©pzene is also used for Hungarian folk music as an umbrella designation of a number of related styles of traditional folk music from Hungary and Hungarian minorities living in modern-day Austria, the, Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, central Romania (Transylvania) (Sz√©kely), Moldova (Cs√°ng√≥), and Serbia. The obscure origins of Hungarian folk music formed among the peasant population in the early nineteenth century with roots dating even further back. However, its broader popularity was largely due to the Hungarian composer Franz Liszt, who in 1846 began composing 19 Hungarian Rhapsodies for piano, five of which were later orchestrated, thus being the first pieces of music by a major composer to incorporate sources from so-called ‚Äúpeasant music‚Äù. These works, which broke free from classical tradition, were often viewed by the elite as brash and unrefined, yet they deeply influenced others, like Johannes Brahms, and later Zolt√°n Kodaly and B√©la Bartok, even having an influence on American jazz. During the 20th century, Hungarian composers were influenced by the traditional music of their nation which may be considered as a repeat of the early \\"nationalist\\" movement of the early 19th century (Beethoven) but is more accurately the artists' desire to escape the hegemony of the classical tradition manifold at that time. B√©la Bart√≥k took this departure into the abstract musical world in his appropriation of traditional Hungarian as the basis for symphonic creations. Zolt√°n Kod√°ly and B√©la Bart√≥k studied over 300 melodies, and noted that more modern tunes used for dancing featured pentatonic turns with frequent leaps in fourths.Elizabeth C. Rearick. 1939.

Twelve of these candidates were elected, and the Progressive Conservatives formed the official opposition in the legislature. Some candidates have their own biography pages; information about others may be founded here. Between 1940 and 1950, Manitoba had been administered by a coalition government led by the Liberal-Progressive Party. The Progressive Conservatives, who had been the secondary power in the coalition, left the government in 1950. This decision split the party, and a number of Progressive Conservatives either retired or chose to remain on the government side. After ten years of coalition government, the Progressive Conservative Party's provincial machinery had largely fallen into disrepair. The party was not able to field a full slate of candidates, and had difficulty mounting effective campaigns in some regions. The 1953 Manitoba election was determined by instant-runoff voting in most constituencies. Three constituencies (Winnipeg Centre, Winnipeg North and Winnipeg South) returned four members by the single transferable vote (STV), with a 20% quota for election. St. Boniface elected two members by STV, with a 33% quota. The Progressive Conservatives ran three candidates in Winnipeg South, two in St. Boniface and Winnipeg Centre, and one in Winnipeg North. In Kildonan‚ÄîTranscona, the local Progressive Conservative association endorsed independent candidate Steve Melnyk. In St. George, the association endorsed Liberal-Progressive incumbent Chris Halldorson. Harry Shewman, an Independent candidate in Morris, also seems to have been at least tacitly endorsed by the Progressive Conservative Party. The party also did not field candidates in Carillon, Emerson, Fisher, Gimli, Gladstone, La Verendrye, Mountain or The Pas. The party also did not contest the deferred elections in Rupertsland and Ste. Rose. Progressive Conservatives candidate had been nominated for both divisions, but in each case the candidate withdrew before election day. J. Arthur Ross (Arthur) Ross was elected in a two-candidate contest with 1,920 votes (57.14%). See his biography page for more information. George E. Fournier (Assiniboia) Fournier was born in Winnipeg, and was an employee for the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) for thirty-one years. He managed the CPR baseball club, and was a member of the Knights of Columbus. He finished third with 1,528 votes (17.68%) on the first count, and was eliminated. The winner was Reginald Wightman of the Liberal-Progressive Party. Fournier died shortly after the election, on September 7, 1953, at age fifty-two. For the last fourteen years of his life, he had resided in the Winnipeg suburb of St. James. Francis Macdonald Manwaring (Birtle) Manwaring was a late nominee in the contest. He received 957 votes (30.82%), losing to Liberal-Progressive candidate Francis Bell in a straight two-candidate contest. Reginald Lissaman (Brandon City) Lissaman placed first on the first count with 3,514 votes (46.04%), and was declared elected on the second count. See his biography page for more information. Roderick George Hurton (Cypress) Hurton was a doctor in Glenboro. He first campaigned for the Manitoba legislature in the 1936 provincial election as a Conservative candidate in Cypress, and narrowly lost to Liberal-Progressive incumbent James Christie. He ran against Christie again in the 1941 election as an independent coalition supporter, and lost by an increased margin. Hurton finished second on the first count in 1953 with 1,198 votes (30.46%), and lost to new Liberal- Progressive candidate Francis Ferg on the second count. Christie had died earlier in the year. Ernest N. McGirr (Dauphin) McGirr served in the Manitoba legislature from 1949 to 1953. He finished third on the first count in the 1953 election with 1,235 votes (23.83%), and was eliminated on transfers. The winner was William Bullmore of the Social Credit Party. See McGirr's biography page for more information. James O. Argue (Deloraine- Glenwood) Argue was elected in a two-candidate contest with 1,862 votes (53.88%). See his biography page for more information. Earl Collins (Dufferin) Collins served in the Manitoba legislature from 1943 to 1949. He finished third out of three candidates in 1953 with 911 votes (22.37%). See his biography page for more information. John L. Solomon (Ethelbert) Solomon finished third out of four candidates with 276 votes (7.23%). Liberal- Progressive candidate Michael N. Hryhorczuk was elected on the first count. Daniel McFadyen (Fairford) McFadyen placed third out of four candidates on the first count with 288 votes (12.70%), and was eliminated. The winner was James Anderson of the Liberal-Progressive Party. Bardette Elliott (Gilbert Plains) Elliott was a farmer and livestock dealer from Grandview. He defeated H.G. Bell and W.G. Chaloner for the Progressive Conservative nomination. In the general election, he finished fourth out of four candidates with 380 votes (12.18%). Edward P. Venables (Hamiota) Venables first campaigned for the Manitoba legislature in the 1949 provincial election, as a Progressive Conservative coalitionist. He received 1,237 votes, and finished a close second against Liberal-Progressive candidate Charles Shuttleworth. He finished second again in 1953 with 1,227 votes (36.62%), losing to Shuttleworth on the second count. John McDowell (Iberville) McDowell finished first on the first count with 1,442 votes (38.68%), and was declared elected on the second count. See his biography page for more information. Abram Harrison (Killarney) Harrison finished first on the first count with 1,786 votes (48.51%), and was declared elected on the second count. See his biography page for more information. Charles H. Spence (Lakeside) Spence was an insurance agent in Poplar Point. He won the Progressive Conservative nomination over Gordon Troop of Burnside. In the general election, he finished third out of four candidates with 662 votes (16.23%). Liberal-Progressive candidate Douglas Campbell, the Premier of Manitoba, won the constituency on the first count. Thomas H. Seens (Lansdowne) Seens served in the Manitoba legislature from 1949 to 1953. He finished second on the first count with 1,563 votes (36.47%), and lost to Liberal-Progressive Matthew R. Sutherland on the second count. See his biography page for more information.

See his biography page for more information. John A. Burgess (Minnedosa) Burgess was a merchant in Minnedosa, and a former mayor of the community. He defeated a young insurance executive named Ralph B. Clarke for the nomination; a third candidate, Percy Coutts of Newdale, withdrew before the vote. Burgess finished third out of three candidates with 1,047 (26.98%). His transfers gave an unexpected victory to Social Credit candidate Gilbert Hutton, who had finished second on the first count. Harold Alexander Nelson (Norfolk‚ÄîBeautiful Plains) Nelson was a farmer in the Carberry district. He campaigned for the House of Commons of Canada in the 1949 federal election as a candidate of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, and finished second against Liberal candidate William Gilbert Weir in Portage‚ÄîNeepawa. He ran for the provincial party later in the year, as a candidate for Norfolk‚ÄîBeautiful Plains in the 1949 provincial election. He again finished second, against Liberal- Progressive candidate Samuel Burch. Nelson fell to third place in 1953, receiving 1,365 votes (27.90%) in a three-candidate race. Burch was again declared the winner. William C. Warren (Portage la Prairie) Warren was born in Oakland, Manitoba, and was 36 years old at the time of the election. He had served with the Royal Canadian Air Force in World War II, was shot down over Germany in 1942, and spent two-and-a-half years in a prisoner of war camp. He worked as a teacher after returning to Canada. He finished second on the first count in 1953 with 1,329 votes (35.29%), and lost to Liberal- Progressive candidate Charles Greenlay on the second count. Leo A. Recksiedler (Rhineland) Recksiedler was a farmer in Rosenfeld, Manitoba. He was nominated in 1953 to challenge Wallace Miller, a provincial cabinet minister who had been elected as a Progressive Conservative, but crossed to the Liberal-Progressive benches after the coalition government came to an end. At the nomination meeting, chair A.J. Thiessen made the following comment: ‚ÄúWe have no desire to run down our present representative, but we feel it is the democratic right of the citizens of Rhineland to express their wishes at the ballot‚Äù (Winnipeg Free Press, 6 February 1953). His supporters claimed that Rhineland needed a representative who understood the concerns of farmers. Miller was re-elected, while Recksiedler finished third with 565 votes (18.01%). Recksiedler ran against Miller again in the 1959 provincial election, and finished a much closer second. Miller subsequently died in office, and Recksiedler once again campaigned for the legislature in a by- election held on November 26, 1959. He was narrowly defeated by Jacob Froese of the Social Credit Party. Fred E. Cowan (Roblin) Cowan was born in Killarney, Manitoba. He was a bookkeeper in Roblin, and was sixty years old at the time of the election. He finished fourth out of four candidates with 227 votes (7.74%). H.G.

John Thompson (Virden) Thompson defeated Clarence Moore and W.T. Cann to win the Progressive Conservative nomination on December 19, 1952. He was elected on the first count with 2,182 votes (57.38%). See his biography page for more information. Hank Scott (Winnipeg Centre) Scott finished fourth on the first count with 2,085 votes (10.13%), and was declared elected to the fourth position on the tenth count with 3,108 votes (15.11%). See his biography page for more information. Joseph Stepnuk (Winnipeg Centre) Stepnuk received 478 votes (2.32%) on the first count, finishing eleventh out of fourteen candidates. He was eliminated after the third count, having increased his total to 489 votes (2.38%). During the campaign, Stepnuk argued that Canadian resources should be chiefly for domestic use, not for export. He also used the slogan, \\"Vote Conservative for Winnipeg - reduce taxes\\". Stepnuk later campaigned in Elmwood in the 1958 provincial election, and finished in third place with 1,084 votes. The winner was Steve Peters of the Manitoba Cooperative Commonwealth Federation. Note: The Progressive Conservatives nominated Scott and Stepnuk for Winnipeg Centre on December 1, 1952, and indicated that other candidates might follow. None did. Stanley M. Carrick (Winnipeg North) Carrick was a councillor in Winnipeg for many years, serving with the centre-right Civic Election Committee. He was first elected to the city council in 1952 for Ward 3, which covered the city's north end. At the time, Winnipeg's three wards elected six members to council in two-year staggered terms, with members chosen by the single transferable vote. Carrick finished fourth on the first count in 1952, but performed well enough on transfers to defeat incumbent Jacob Penner by 17 votes on the fifth and final count. Penner was a member of the Communist Labour Progressive Party, and his defeat brought a temporary end to Communist representation on the council. He first ran for the Manitoba legislature in the 1949 provincial election, as a Progressive Conservative candidate supporting the governing alliance with the Liberal-Progressives. He finished eighth on the first count with 1,126 votes, and was eliminated after the fifth count with 1,384. Carrick was nominated for the 1953 election as the lone Progressive Conservative candidate in Winnipeg North, defeating challenger John F. Kubas. He finished fifth on the first count with 1,795 votes, and was eliminated after the sixth count with 2,373 votes. During this election, he used the slogan, \\"Was a good school trustee, is a good alderman, will be a good MLA\\". After the provincial campaign, Carrick sought the federal Progressive Conservative nomination in Winnipeg North for the 1953 federal election. He was defeated by John Kereluk. He ran for the legislature a third time in the 1958 election, after Winnipeg's multi- member constituencies had been replaced with single-member divisions. He finished second in St. John's, losing to David Orlikow of the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation by 1,200 votes. Dufferin Roblin (Winnipeg South) Roblin was declared elected to the second position on the first ballot. He became leader of the Progressive Conservative Party in 1954, and Premier of Manitoba in 1958. See his biography page for more information. Gurney Evans (Winnipeg South) Evans was declared elected to the fourth position on the seventh and final count. During the campaign, he used the slogan \\"Better government demands better plans\\". He later served as a cabinet minister under Roblin. See his biography page for more information. Maude McCreery (Winnipeg South) McCreery was a Winnipeg city councillor at the time of the election. Serving as a member of the Civic Election Committee. Shortly before the election, she was one of five councillors to oppose a bill outlawing racial discrimination in the workplace. McCreery was the first woman to run for provincial office in Manitoba as a candidate of the Progressive Conservative Party. She finished fifth on the first count with 1,820 votes (6.25%), and was eliminated on the sixth count with 2,318 votes (7.96%). She was re-elected to the Winnipeg City Council for Ward One in the 1953 Winnipeg municipal election, held a few months after the provincial contest. The Progressive Conservatives also endorsed Independent candidate Steve Melnyk in Kildonan‚ÄîTranscona. 1953 ","title":"Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba candidates in the 1953 Manitoba provincial election"},{"id":"2749245","text":"Genesis Archive 1967‚Äì75 is a box set by the English progressive rock band Genesis, released in June 1998 on Virgin Records in the United Kingdom and by Atlantic Records in the United States.

The set includes previously unreleased studio, live, and demo tracks, some of which include re-recorded vocal and guitar parts from Gabriel and Hackett, respectively. Genesis Archive 1967‚Äì75 reached No. 35 in the UK. Background Discs one and two contain the first official live release of a full concert from the band's 1974‚Äì1975 tour of The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway (1974). It was recorded on 24 January 1975 at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, and the only one of the tour's 102 dates to be recorded in multi-track. It is one of a collection of tracks on the box set with newly recorded vocals from Gabriel and guitar parts from Hackett, partly due to the difficulty Gabriel had as his more elaborate costumes often muffled his voice. \\"It.\\" is a re-worked studio version with new vocals based on the live recording, as the recording used as a source for the release had ended early due to the recorder at the concert having run out of tape, however the song actually played at the show appears on the As Though Emerald City bootleg, released in 1975 by The Amazing Kornyfone Record Label. Discs three and four contain previously unreleased live tracks from 1973, demos, single edits, and a BBC radio session from 1970, the latter featuring the band's early drummers John Silver and John Mayhew. The set is packaged with an 80-page booklet and extensive liner notes. To promote the release, Banks, Gabriel, Rutherford, Phillips, Silver, Collins, and Hackett gathered at Heathrow Business Centre on 11 May 1998 for a photograph shoot and interviews.

The 17th edition of the festival in 2016 featured 160 films in the program. The festival leader is Tor Fosse, and BIFF is owned by Bergen Cinema. The festivals main venue is Bergen Cinema's Magnus Barefoot Cinema Centre, with additional screenings taking place at the local art film theatre at Georgernes Verft and at the student cinema at Kvarteret. History The Magnus Barefoot Cinema Centre i Bergen, the main venue of BIFF. In 2000, Bergen was a European Capital of Culture. Due to the occasion, Bergen Cinema arranged Bergen International Film Festival, with the most important films from the festival circuit of the year and many sneak previews of movies already picked up for Norwegian distribution. BIFF was one of the most successful events to take place during the celebration of the Cultural City with almost 20,000 visitors, and was arranged again the year after. Over the years the festival has grown to be one of the biggest in Norway, with more than 160 films and 64,000 admissions in 2016. Programmes Bergen International Film Festival is organised in various sections: * Checkpoints, the main program at BIFF, hosted with the Rafto Foundation for Human Rights, consisting of documentaries focusing on human rights. Since 2010, a jury has selected a winner. * International Documentary Program, with a special selection competing for the best international documentary award. * Norwegian Documentary Program, with a special selection competing for awards for best Norwegian documentary and best Norwegian short documentary. * Norwegian Short Film Competition, a special program of short films, where filmmakers have to apply before being accepted. BIFF and education Bergen International Film Festival has an extensive program for high school and junior high school students in Bergen. BIFFs offers schools in the area to participate in two different programs: =BIFF for Schools= The festival offers free showing of documentaries that covers important subjects in history, democracy and human rights. BIFF also tries to bring filmmakers and even the characters the films portray to the screenings, making it possible for the students to converse with the talent afterwards.

It was created and used as a foundation deposit following the Persian conquest of Babylon in 539 BC, when the Neo-Babylonian Empire was invaded by Cyrus and incorporated into his Persian Empire. The text on the Cylinder praises Cyrus, sets out his genealogy and portrays him as a king from a line of kings. The Babylonian king Nabonidus, who was defeated and deposed by Cyrus, is denounced as an impious oppressor of the people of Babylonia and his low-born origins are implicitly contrasted to Cyrus' kingly heritage. The victorious Cyrus is portrayed as having been chosen by the chief Babylonian god Marduk to restore peace and order to the Babylonians. The text states that Cyrus was welcomed by the people of Babylon as their new ruler and entered the city in peace. It appeals to Marduk to protect and help Cyrus and his son Cambyses. It extols Cyrus as a benefactor of the citizens of Babylonia who improved their lives, repatriated displaced people and restored temples and cult sanctuaries across Mesopotamia and elsewhere in the region. It concludes with a description of how Cyrus repaired the city wall of Babylon and found a similar inscription placed there by an earlier king. The Cylinder's text has traditionally been seen by biblical scholars as corroborative evidence of Cyrus' policy of the repatriation of the Jewish people following their Babylonian captivity (an act that the Book of Ezra attributes to CyrusFree & Vos (1992), p. 204), as the text refers to the restoration of cult sanctuaries and repatriation of deported peoples. This interpretation has been disputed, as the text identifies only Mesopotamian sanctuaries, and makes no mention of Jews, Jerusalem, or Judea. The Cylinder has also been referred to by Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran as the first declaration of universal human rights, a view rejected by some historians as anachronistic and a misunderstanding of the Cylinder's generic nature as a typical statement made by a new monarch at the beginning of his reign. Neil MacGregor, former Director of the British Museum, has stated that the cylinder was \\"the first attempt we know about running a society, a state with different nationalities and faiths‚Äîa new kind of statecraft\\". It was adopted as a national symbol of Iran by the Imperial State which put it on display in Tehran in 1971 to commemorate 2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire. On October 14, 1971, the Shah's sister, Princess Ashraf Pahlavi, presented the United Nations Secretary General U Thant with a replica of the Cylinder. The princess asserted that \\"the heritage of Cyrus was the heritage of human understanding, tolerance, courage, compassion and, above all, human liberty\\".  Discovery  Hormuzd Rassam in Mosul circa 1854. The Cyrus Cylinder was discovered during Rassam's excavations in Babylon in February‚ÄìMarch 1879. The Assyro-British archaeologist Hormuzd Rassam discovered the Cyrus Cylinder in March 1879 during a lengthy programme of excavations in Mesopotamia carried out for the British Museum.Finkel (2009), p. 172 It had been placed as a foundation deposit in the foundations of the √âsagila, the city's main temple. Rassam's expedition followed on from an earlier dig carried out in 1850 by the British archaeologist Austen Henry Layard, who excavated three mounds in the same area but found little of importance. In 1877, Layard became Britain's ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, which ruled Mesopotamia at the time. He helped Rassam, who had been his assistant in the 1850 dig, to obtain a firman (decree) from the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II to continue the earlier excavations. The firman was only valid for a year but a second firman, with much more liberal terms, was issued in 1878. It was granted for two years (through to 15 October 1880) with the promise of an extension to 1882 if required.Hilprecht (1903), pp. 204‚Äì05 The Sultan's decree authorised Rassam to \\"pack and dispatch to England any antiquities [he] found ... provided, however, there were no duplicates\\". A representative of the Sultan was instructed to be present at the dig to examine the objects as they were uncovered.Rassam (1897), p. 223 With permission secured, Rassam initiated a large-scale excavation at Babylon and other sites on behalf of the Trustees of the British Museum. He undertook the excavations in four distinct phases. In between each phase, he returned to England to bring back his finds and raise more funds for further work. The Cyrus Cylinder was found on the second of his four expeditions to Mesopotamia, which began with his departure from London on 8 October 1878. He arrived in his home town of Mosul on 16 November and travelled down the Tigris to Baghdad, which he reached on 30 January 1879. During February and March, he supervised excavations on a number of Babylonian sites, including Babylon itself. Map of the site of Babylon in 1829. Hormuzd Rassam's diggers found the Cyrus Cylinder in the mound of Tell Amran-ibn-Ali (marked with an \\"E\\" at the centre of the map) under which lay the ruined Esagila temple. He soon uncovered a number of important buildings including the √âsagila temple. This was a major shrine to the chief Babylonian god Marduk, although its identity was not fully confirmed until the German archaeologist Robert Koldewey's excavation of 1900.Koldewey, p. vi The excavators found a large number of business documents written on clay tablets buried in the temple's foundations where they discovered the Cyrus Cylinder.Vos (1995), p. 267 Rassam gave conflicting accounts of where his discoveries were made. He wrote in his memoirs, Asshur and the land of Nimrod, that the Cylinder had been found in a mound at the southern end of Babylon near the village of Jumjuma or Jimjima.Rassam, p. 267Hilprecht (1903), p. 264 However, in a letter sent on 20 November 1879 to Samuel Birch, the Keeper of Oriental Antiquities at the British Museum, he wrote, \\"The Cylinder of Cyrus was found at Omran [Tell Amran-ibn-Ali] with about six hundred pieces of inscribed terracottas before I left Baghdad.\\"Walker, pp. 158‚Äì159 He left Baghdad on 2 April, returning to Mosul and departing from there on 2 May for a journey to London which lasted until 19 June. The discovery was announced to the public by Sir Henry Rawlinson, the President of the Royal Asiatic Society, at a meeting of the Society on 17 November 1879.The Times (18 November 1879) He described it as \\"one of the most interesting historical records in the cuneiform character that has yet been brought to light\\", though he erroneously described it as coming from the ancient city of Borsippa rather than Babylon.The Oriental Journal (January 1880) Rawlinson's \\"Notes on a newly-discovered Clay Cylinder of Cyrus the Great\\" were published in the society's journal the following year, including the first partial translation of the text.Rawlinson (1880), pp. 70‚Äì97  Description  The Cyrus Cylinder is a barrel-shaped cylinder of baked clay measuring by at its maximum diameter. It was created in several stages around a cone-shaped core of clay within which there are large grey stone inclusions. It was built up with extra layers of clay to give it a cylindrical shape before a fine surface slip of clay was added to the outer layer, on which the text is inscribed. It was excavated in several fragments, having apparently broken apart in antiquity. Today it exists in two main fragments, known as \\"A\\" and \\"B\\", which were reunited in 1972. The main body of the Cylinder, discovered by Rassam in 1879, is fragment \\"A\\". It underwent restoration in 1961, when it was re-fired and plaster filling was added. The smaller fragment, \\"B\\", is a section measuring by . The latter fragment was acquired by J.B. Nies of Yale University from an antiquities dealer.Curtis, Tallis & Andr√©-Salvini, p. 59 Nies published the text in 1920.Nies & Keiser (1920) The fragment was apparently broken off the main body of the Cylinder during the original excavations in 1879 and was either removed from the excavations or was retrieved from one of Rassam's waste dumps. It was not confirmed as part of the Cylinder until Paul-Richard Berger of the University of M√ºnster definitively identified it in 1970.Berger, pp. 155‚Äì159 Yale University lent the fragment to the British Museum temporarily (but, in practice, indefinitely) in exchange for \\"a suitable cuneiform tablet\\" from the British Museum collection. Although the Cylinder clearly post-dates Cyrus the Great's conquest of Babylon in 539 BC, the date of its creation is unclear. It is commonly said to date to the early part of Cyrus's reign over Babylon, some time after 539 BC. The British Museum puts the Cylinder's date of origin at between 539‚Äì530 BC. = Text = The surviving inscription on the Cyrus Cylinder consists of 45 lines of text written in Akkadian cuneiform script. The first 35 lines are on fragment \\"A\\" and the remainder are on fragment \\"B\\". A number of lines at the start and end of the text are too badly damaged for more than a few words to be legible. The text is written in an extremely formulaic style that can be divided into six distinct parts: Extract from the Cyrus Cylinder (lines 15‚Äì21), giving the genealogy of Cyrus and an account of his capture of Babylon in 539 BC (E. A. Wallis Budge, 1884). * Lines 1‚Äì19: an introduction reviling Nabonidus, the previous king of Babylon, and associating Cyrus with the god Marduk; * Lines 20‚Äì22: detailing Cyrus's royal titles and genealogy, and his peaceful entry to Babylon; * Lines 22‚Äì34: a commendation of Cyrus's policy of restoring Babylon; * Lines 34‚Äì35: a prayer to Marduk on behalf of Cyrus and his son Cambyses; * Lines 36‚Äì37: a declaration that Cyrus has enabled the people to live in peace and has increased the offerings made to the gods; * Lines 38‚Äì45: details of the building activities ordered by Cyrus in Babylon.Wieseh√∂fer (2001), pp. 44‚Äì45. Sample detail image showing cuneiform script. The beginning of the text is partly broken; the surviving content reprimands the character of the deposed Babylonian king Nabonidus. It lists his alleged crimes, charging him with the desecration of the temples of the gods and the imposition of forced labor upon the populace. According to the proclamation, as a result of these offenses, the god Marduk abandoned Babylon and sought a more righteous king. Marduk called forth Cyrus to enter Babylon and become its new ruler. Midway through the text, the writer switches to a first-person narrative in the voice of Cyrus, addressing the reader directly. A list of his titles is given (in a Mesopotamian rather than Persian style): \\"I am Cyrus, king of the world, great king, powerful king, king of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad, king of the four quarters [of the earth], son of Cambyses, great king, king of Anshan, descendant of Teispes, great king, king of Anshan, the perpetual seed of kingship, whose reign Bel [Marduk] and Nebo love, and with whose kingship, to their joy, they concern themselves.\\"Translation of the text on the Cyrus Cylinder. Finkel, Irving. He describes the pious deeds he performed after his conquest: he restored peace to Babylon and the other cities sacred to Marduk, freeing their inhabitants from their \\"yoke,\\" and he \\"brought relief to their dilapidated housing (thus) putting an end to their (main) complaints\\".Pritchard He repaired the ruined temples in the cities he conquered, restored their cults, and returned their sacred images as well as their former inhabitants which Nabonidus had taken to Babylon. Near the end of the inscription Cyrus highlights his restoration of Babylon's city wall, saying: \\"I saw within it an inscription of Ashurbanipal, a king who preceded me.\\" The remainder is missing but presumably describes Cyrus's rededication of the gateway mentioned.Kutsko, p. 123 A partial transcription by F. H. Weissbach in 1911 was supplanted by a much more complete transcription after the identification of the \\"B\\" fragment;Weissbach, p. 2 this is now available in German and in English.Schaudig, pp. 550‚Äì556Hallo, p. 315 Several editions of the full text of the Cyrus Cylinder are available online, incorporating both \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" fragments. A false translation of the text ‚Äì affirming, among other things, the abolition of slavery and the right to self-determination, a minimum wage and asylum ‚Äì has been promoted on the Internet and elsewhere.Schulz (2008-07-15) As well as making claims that are not found on the real cylinder, it refers to the Zoroastrian divinity Ahura Mazda rather than the Mesopotamian god Marduk.compare with the British Museum translation at The false translation has been widely circulated; alluding to its claim that Cyrus supposedly has stated that \\"Every country shall decide for itself whether or not it wants my leadership.\\" Iranian Nobel Peace Prize winner Shirin Ebadi in her acceptance speech described Cyrus as \\"the very emperor who proclaimed at the pinnacle of power 2,500 years ago that ‚Ä¶ he would not reign over the people if they did not wish it\\".Foucart (2007-08-19) = Associated fragments = The British Museum announced in January 2010 that two inscribed clay fragments, which had been in the Museum's collection since 1881, had been identified as part of a cuneiform tablet that was inscribed with the same text as the Cyrus Cylinder. The fragments had come from the small site of Dailem near Babylon and the identification was made by Professor Wilfred Lambert, formerly of the University of Birmingham, and Irving Finkel, curator in charge of the Museum's Department of the Middle East.Cyrus Cylinder (press release). British Museum, 20 January 2010 = Relation to a Chinese bone inscription = In 1983 two fossilized horse bones inscribed with cuneiform signs surfaced in China which Professor Oliver Gurney at Oxford later identified as coming from the Cyrus Cylinder. The discovery of these objects aroused much discussion about possible connections between ancient Mesopotamia and China, although their authenticity was doubted by many scholars from the beginning and they are now generally regarded as forgeries. The history of the putative artifact goes back almost a century. The earliest record goes back to a Chinese doctor named Xue Shenwei, who sometime prior to 1928 was shown a photo of a rubbing of one of the bones by an antiquities dealer named Zhang Yi'an. Although not able to view the bones at that time, Xue Shenwei later acquired one of them from another antiquities dealer named Wang Dongting in 1935 and then the second via a personal connection named Ke Yanling around 1940. While Xue did not recognize the script on the bones he guessed at its antiquity and buried the bones for safekeeping during the Cultural Revolution. Then, in 1983 Xue presented the bones to the Palace Museum in Beijing where Liu Jiuan and Wang Nanfang of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage undertook their study. These officials identified the script as cuneiform and asked the Assyriologists Chi Yang and Wu Yuhong to work on the inscriptions. Identification of the source text proceeded slowly until 1985, when Wu Yuhong along with Oxford Assyriologist Stephanie Dalley and Oliver Gurney recognized the text in one bone as coming from the Cyrus Cylinder. One year later Wu Yuhong presented his findings at the 33rd Rencontre Assyriologique and published them in a journal article. After that the second bone inscription remained undeciphered until 2010, when Irving Finkel worked on it. In that same year the British Museum held a conference dedicated to the artifacts. Based on the serious textual errors in the inscription, including the omission of a large number of signs from the Cyrus Cylinder, Wu Yuhong argued the inscriptions were most likely copied from the cylinder while housed in the British Museum or from an early modern publication based upon it. However he acknowledged the remote possibility it was copied in late antiquity. Irving Finkel disputed this conclusion based on the relative obscurity of the Cyrus Cylinder until recent decades and the mismatch in paleography between the bone inscriptions and the hand copies found in early editions from the 1880s. Finally, after the workshop concluded, an 1884 edition of the Cyrus Cylinder by E. A. Wallis Budge came to Irving Finkel's attention. This publication used an idiosyncratic typeface and featured a handcopy for only a section of the whole cylinder. However the typeface in that edition matched the paleography on the bone inscriptions and the extract of the cylinder published in the book matched that of the bone as well. This convinced Finkel that the bone inscriptions were early modern forgeries and that has remained the majority opinion since then.  Interpretations  Mesopotamian and Persian tradition and propaganda = According to the British Museum, the Cyrus Cylinder reflects a long tradition in Mesopotamia where, from as early as the third millennium BC, kings began their reigns with declarations of reforms.British Museum: The Cyrus Cylinder Cyrus's declaration stresses his legitimacy as the king, and is a conspicuous statement of his respect for the religious and political traditions of Babylon. The British Museum and scholars of the period describe it as an instrument of ancient Mesopotamian propaganda.Inscription in the British Museum, Room 55Kuhrt (1982), p. 124 The text is a royal building inscription, a genre which had no equivalent in Old Persian literature. It illustrates how Cyrus co-opted local traditions and symbols to legitimize his conquest and control of Babylon.Winn Leith, p. 285 Many elements of the text were drawn from long-standing Mesopotamian themes of legitimizing rule in Babylonia: the preceding king is reprimanded and he is proclaimed to have been abandoned by the gods for his wickedness; the new king has gained power through the divine will of the gods; the new king rights the wrongs of his predecessor, addressing the welfare of the people; the sanctuaries of the gods are rebuilt or restored, offerings to the gods are made or increased and the blessings of the gods are sought; and repairs are made to the whole city, in the manner of earlier rightful kings. Both continuity and discontinuity are emphasized in the text of the Cylinder. It asserts the virtue of Cyrus as a gods-fearing king of a traditional Mesopotamian type. On the other hand, it constantly discredits Nabonidus, reviling the deposed king's deeds and even his ancestry and portraying him as an impious destroyer of his own people. As Fowler and Hekster note, this \\"creates a problem for a monarch who chooses to buttress his claim to legitimacy by appropriating the 'symbolic capital' of his predecessors\\".Fowler & Hekster, p. 33 The Cylinder's reprimand of Nabonidus also discredits Babylonian royal authority by association. It is perhaps for this reason that the Achaemenid rulers made greater use of Assyrian rather than Babylonian royal iconography and tradition in their declarations; the Cylinder refers to the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal as \\"my predecessor\\", rather than any native Babylonian ruler. The Cylinder itself is part of a continuous Mesopotamian tradition of depositing a wide variety of symbolic items, including animal sacrifices, stone tablets, terracotta cones, cylinders and figures. Newly crowned kings of Babylon would make public declarations of their own righteousness when beginning their reigns, often in the form of declarations that were deposited in the foundations of public buildings.British Museum: The Cyrus Cylinder; Kuhrt (1983), pp. 83‚Äì97; Dandamaev, pp. 52‚Äì53; Beaulieu, p. 243; van der Spek, pp. 273‚Äì285; Wieseh√∂fer (2001), p. 82; Briant, p. 43 Some contained messages, while others did not, and they had a number of purposes: elaboration of a building's value, commemoration of the ruler or builder and the magical sanctification of the building, through the invocation of divine protection. The cylinder was not intended to be seen again after its burial, but the text inscribed on it would have been used for public purposes. Archive copies were kept of important inscriptions and the Cylinder's text may likewise have been copied.Haubold, p. 52 fn. 24 In January 2010, the British Museum announced that two cuneiform tablets in its collection had been found to be inscribed with the same text as that on the Cyrus Cylinder,British Museum e-mail (2010-01-11) which, according to the Museum, \\"show that the text of the Cylinder was probably a proclamation that was widely distributed across the Persian Empire\\".British Museum statement (2010-01-20) A statue of the cylinder is now on exhibit in Los Angeles on the Avenue of the Stars as a gift from the Persian people to the city of Los Angeles  Similarities with other royal inscriptions  Nabonidus Cylinder The Cyrus Cylinder bears striking similarities to older Mesopotamian royal inscriptions. Two notable examples are the Cylinder of Marduk-apla-iddina II, who seized the Babylonian throne in 722/1 BC, and the annals of Sargon II of Assyria, who conquered Babylon twelve years later. As a conqueror, Marduk-apla-iddina faced many of the same problems of legitimacy that Cyrus did when he conquered Babylon. He declares himself to have been chosen personally by Marduk, who ensured his victory. When he took power, he performed the sacred rites and restored the sacred shrines. He states that he found a royal inscription placed in the temple foundations by an earlier Babylonian king, which he left undisturbed and honored. All of these claims also appear in Cyrus's Cylinder. Twelve years later, the Assyrian king Sargon II defeated and exiled Marduk-apla-iddina, taking up the kingship of Babylonia. Sargon's annals describe how he took on the duties of a Babylonian sovereign, honouring the gods, maintaining their temples and respecting and upholding the privileges of the urban elite. Again, Cyrus's Cylinder makes exactly the same points. Nabonidus, Cyrus's deposed predecessor as king of Babylon, commissioned foundation texts on clay cylinders ‚Äì such as the Cylinder of Nabonidus, also in the British Museum ‚Äì that follows the same basic formula.Kuhrt (2007), pp. 174‚Äì175. The text of the Cylinder thus indicates a strong continuity with centuries of Babylonian tradition, as part of an established rhetoric advanced by conquerors. As Kuhrt puts it: The familiarity with long-established Babylonian tropes suggests that the Cylinder was authored by the Babylonian priests of Marduk, working at the behest of Cyrus.Dyck, pp. 91‚Äì94. It can be compared with another work of around the same time, the Verse Account of Nabonidus, in which the former Babylonian ruler is excoriated as the enemy of the priests of Marduk and Cyrus is presented as the liberator of Babylon.Grabbe (2004), p. 267 Both works make a point of stressing Cyrus's qualifications as a king from a line of kings, in contrast to the non-royal ancestry of Nabonidus, who is described by the Cylinder as merely ma≈£√ª, \\"insignificant\\".Dick, p. 10 The Verse Account is so similar to the Cyrus Cylinder inscription that the two texts have been dubbed an example of \\"literary dependence\\" ‚Äì not the direct dependence of one upon the other, but mutual dependence upon a common source. This is characterised by the historian Morton Smith as \\"the propaganda put out in Babylonia by Cyrus's agents, shortly before Cyrus's conquest, to prepare the way of their lord\\".Smith, p. 78 This viewpoint has been disputed; as Simon J. Sherwin of the University of Cambridge puts it, the Cyrus Cylinder and the Verse Account are \\"after the event\\" compositions which reuse existing Mesopotamian literary themes and do not need to be explained as the product of pre-conquest Persian propaganda.Sherwin, p. 122. The German historian Hanspeter Schaudig has identified a line on the Cylinder (\\"He [i.e. Marduk] saved his city Babylon from its oppression\\") with a line from tablet VI of the Babylonian \\"Epic of Creation\\", En√ªma Eli≈°, in which Marduk builds Babylon.Haubold, p. 51 Johannes Haubold suggests that reference represents Cyrus's takeover as a moment of ultimate restoration not just of political and religious institutions, but of the cosmic order underpinning the universe.Haubold, p. 52 Analysis of the Cylinder's claims Stele depicting Nabonidus praying to the moon, sun and the planet Venus. The Babylonian king's religious practices were harshly condemned by the Cyrus Cylinder's inscription. :Vilification of Nabonidus The Cyrus Cylinder's vilification of Nabonidus is consistent with other Persian propaganda regarding the deposed king's rule. In contrast to the Cylinder's depiction of Nabonidus as an illegitimate ruler who ruined his country, the reign of Nabonidus was largely peaceful, he was recognised as a legitimate king and he undertook a variety of building projects and military campaigns commensurate with his claim to be \\"the king of Babylon, the universe, and the four corners [of the Earth]\\".Bidmead, p. 137 :Nabonidus as actually seen in Babylon The Assyriologist Paul-Alain Beaulieu has interpreted Nabonidus's exaltation of the moon god Sin as \\"an outright usurpation of Marduk's prerogatives by the moon god\\".Bidmead, p. 134 Although the Babylonian king continued to make rich offerings to Marduk, his greater devotion to Sin was unacceptable to the Babylonian priestly elite.Bidmead, p. 135 Nabonidus came from the unfashionable north of Babylonia, introduced foreign gods and went into a lengthy self-imposed exile which was said to have prevented the celebration of the vital New Year festival.Mallowan, pp. 409‚Äì411 :Conquest and local support Cyrus's conquest of Babylonia was resisted by Nabonidus and his supporters, as the Battle of Opis demonstrated. Iranologist Pierre Briant comments that \\"it is doubtful that even before the fall of [Babylon] Cyrus was impatiently awaited by a population desperate for a 'liberator'.\\"Briant, p. 43 However, Cyrus's takeover as king does appear to have been welcomed by some of the Babylonian population.Buchanan, pp. 12‚Äì13 The Judaic historian Lisbeth S. Fried says that there is little evidence that the high-ranking priests of Babylonia during the Achaemenid period were Persians and characterises them as Babylonian collaborators.Fried, p. 30 The text presents Cyrus as entering Babylon peacefully and being welcomed by the population as a liberator. This presents an implicit contrast with previous conquerors, notably the Assyrian rulers Tukulti-Ninurta I, who invaded and plundered Babylon in the 12th century BC, and Sennacherib, who did the same thing 150 years before Cyrus conquered the region. The massacre and enslavement of conquered people was common practice and was explicitly highlighted by conquerors in victory statements. The Cyrus Cylinder presents a very different message; Johannes Haubold notes that it portrays Cyrus's takeover as a harmonious moment of convergence between Babylonian and Persian history, not a natural disaster but the salvation of Babylonia. However, the Cylinder's account of Cyrus's conquest clearly does not tell the whole story, as it suppresses any mention of the earlier conflict between the Persians and the Babylonians; Max Mallowan describes it as a \\"skilled work of tendentious history\\". The text omits the Battle of Opis, in which Cyrus's forces defeated and apparently massacred Nabonidus's army.Oppenheim, A. Leo, in Pritchard, James B. Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament. Princeton University Press, 1950Briant, p. 41 Nor does it explain a two-week gap reported by the Nabonidus Chronicle between the Persian entry into Babylon and the surrender of the Esagila temple. Lisbeth S. Fried suggests that there may have been a siege or stand-off between the Persians and the temple's defenders and priests, about whose fate the Cylinder and Chronicle makes no mention. She speculates that they were killed or expelled by the Persians and replaced by more pro-Persian members of the Babylonian priestly elite.Fried, p. 29 As Walton and Hill put it, the claim of a wholly peaceful takeover acclaimed by the people is \\"standard conqueror's rhetoric and may obscure other facts\\".Walton & Hill, p. 172 Describing the claim of one's own armies being welcomed as liberators as \\"one of the great imperial fantasies\\", Bruce Lincoln, Professor of Divinity at the University of Chicago, notes that the Babylonian population repeatedly revolted against Persian rule in 522 BC, 521 BC, 484 BC and 482 BC (though not against Cyrus or his son Cambeses). The rebels sought to restore national independence and the line of native Babylonian kings ‚Äì perhaps an indication that they were not as favourably disposed towards the Persians as the Cylinder suggests.Lincoln, p. 40 :Restoration of temples The inscription goes on to describe Cyrus returning to their original sanctuaries the statues of the gods that Nabonidus had brought to the city before the Persian invasion. This restored the normal cultic order to the satisfaction of the priesthood. It alludes to temples being restored and deported groups being returned to their homelands but does not imply an empire-wide programme of restoration. Instead, it refers to specific areas in the border region between Babylonia and Persia, including sites that had been devastated by earlier Babylonian military campaigns. The Cylinder indicates that Cyrus sought to acquire the loyalty of the ravaged regions by funding reconstruction, the return of temple properties and the repatriation of the displaced populations. However, it is unclear how much actually changed on the ground; there is no archaeological evidence for any rebuilding or repairing of Mesopotamian temples during Cyrus's reign. :Internal policy The Persians' policy towards their subject people, as described by the Cylinder, was traditionally viewed as an expression of tolerance, moderation and generosity \\"on a scale previously unknown\\".Masroori, p. 13-15 The policies of Cyrus toward subjugated nations have been contrasted to those of the Assyrians and Babylonians, who had treated subject peoples harshly; he permitted the resettling of those who had been previously deported and sponsored the reconstruction of religious buildings.Dandamaev, pp. 52‚Äì53 Cyrus was often depicted positively in Western tradition by sources such as the Old Testament of the Bible and the Greek writers Herodotus and Xenophon.Brown, pp. 7‚Äì8Arberry, p. 8 The Cyropaedia of Xenophon was particularly influential during the Renaissance when Cyrus was romanticised as an exemplary model of a virtuous and successful ruler.Stillman, p. 225 Modern historians argue that while Cyrus's behavior was indeed conciliatory, it was driven by the needs of the Persian Empire, and was not an expression of personal tolerance per se.Min, p. 94 The empire was too large to be centrally directed; Cyrus followed a policy of using existing territorial units to implement a decentralized system of government. The magnanimity shown by Cyrus won him praise and gratitude from those he spared.Evans, pp. 12‚Äì13 The policy of toleration described by the Cylinder was thus, as biblical historian Rainer Albertz puts it, \\"an expression of conservative support for local regions to serve the political interests of the whole [empire]\\".Albertz, pp. 115‚Äì116 Another biblical historian, Alberto Soggin, comments that it was more \\"a matter of practicality and economy ‚Ä¶ [as] it was simpler, and indeed cost less, to obtain the spontaneous collaboration of their subjects at a local level than to have to impose their sovereignty by force\\".Soggin, p. 295 = Biblical interpretations = Places in Mesopotamia mentioned by the Cyrus Cylinder. Most of the localities it mentions in connection with the restoration of temples were in eastern and northern Mesopotamia, in territories that had been ruled by the deposed Babylonian king Nabonidus (excepting Susa). The Bible records that some Jews (who were exiled by the Babylonians), returned to their homeland from Babylon, where they had been settled by Nebuchadnezzar, to rebuild the temple following an edict from Cyrus. The Book of Ezra (1‚Äì4:5) provides a narrative account of the rebuilding project.Hurowitz, pp. 581‚Äì591 Scholars have linked one particular passage from the Cylinder to the Old Testament account: This passage has often been interpreted as a reference to the benign policy instituted by Cyrus of allowing exiled peoples, such as the Jews, to return to their original homelands.Becking, p. 8 The Cylinder's inscription has been linked with the reproduction in the Book of Ezra of two texts that are claimed to be edicts issued by Cyrus concerning the repatriation of the Jews and the reconstruction of the Temple in Jerusalem.Dandamaev (2010-01-26) The two edicts (one in Hebrew and one in Aramaic) are substantially different in content and tone, leading some historians to argue that one or both may be a post hoc fabrication.Bedford, p. 113 The question of their authenticity remains unresolved, though it is widely believed that they do reflect some sort of Persian royal policy, albeit perhaps not one that was couched in the terms given in the text of the biblical edicts. The dispute over the authenticity of the biblical edicts has prompted interest in this passage from the Cyrus Cylinder, specifically concerning the question of whether it indicates that Cyrus had a general policy of repatriating subject peoples and restoring their sanctuaries.Bedford, p. 134 The text of the Cylinder is very specific, listing places in Mesopotamia and the neighboring regions. It does not describe any general release or return of exiled communities but focuses on the return of Babylonian deities to their own home cities. It emphasises the re- establishment of local religious norms, reversing the alleged neglect of Nabonidus ‚Äì a theme that Am√©lie Kuhrt describes as \\"a literary device used to underline the piety of Cyrus as opposed to the blasphemy of Nabonidus\\". She suggests that Cyrus had simply adopted a policy used by earlier Assyrian rulers of giving privileges to cities in key strategic or politically sensitive regions and that there was no general policy as such.Kuhrt (1983), pp. 83‚Äì97 Lester L. Grabbe, a historian of early Judaism, has written that \\"the religious policy of the Persians was not that different from the basic practice of the Assyrians and Babylonians before them\\" in tolerating ‚Äì but not promoting ‚Äì local cults, other than their own gods.Grabbe (2006), p. 542 Cyrus may have seen Jerusalem, situated in a strategic location between Mesopotamia and Egypt, as worth patronising for political reasons. His Achaemenid successors generally supported indigenous cults in subject territories as an expression of their legitimacy as rulers, thereby currying favour with the cults' devotees.Bedford, pp. 138‚Äì139 Conversely, the Persian kings could, and did, destroy the shrines of peoples who had rebelled against them, as happened at Miletos in 494 BC following the Ionian Revolt.Greaves, Alan M. Miletos: A History, p. 84. Routledge, 2002. Historian Ernst Badian has noted regarding the Ionian revolt \\"[that] Harpagus 'devastated' all of lower Asia (1.177) is obviously an exaggeration, for the Ionians soon returned to their trading activities.\\" The Persians evidently did give permission for its reconstruction, which would have been required given the circumstances of its destruction. However, the Cylinder's text does not describe any general policy of a return of exiles or mention any sanctuary outside Babylonia;Janzen, p. 157 the biblical historian Bob Becking concludes that \\"it has nothing to do with Judeans, Jews or Jerusalem.\\" Peter Ross Bedford argues that the Cylinder \\"is thus not a manifesto for a general policy regarding indigenous cults and their worshippers throughout the empire\\".Bedford, p. 137 Kuhrt comments that \\"the purely Babylonian context of the Cylinder provides no proof\\" of the historicity of Cyrus's return of the Jewish exiles and the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem, though Becking links this with the lack of any references to the Jews in surviving Achaemenid texts ‚Äì an indication that the Persians seem not to have regarded them as being of any great importance. The German scholar Josef Wieseh√∂fer summarizes the widely held traditional view by noting that \\"Many scholars have read into [‚Ä¶] sentences [from the text of Cylinder] a confirmation of the Old Testament passages about the steps taken by Cyrus towards the erection of the Jerusalem temple and the repatriation of the Judaeans\\" and this interpretation was, according to Wieseh√∂fer, for some scholars a strict belief \\"that the instructions to this effect were actually provided in these very formulations of the Cyrus Cylinder\\". = Human rights = The Cylinder gained new prominence in the late 1960s when the last Shah of Iran called it \\"the world's first charter of human rights\\".MacGregor The cylinder was a key symbol of the Shah's political ideology and is still regarded by some commentators as a charter of human rights, despite the disagreement of some historians and scholars.  Pahlavi Iranian government's view  Cyrus Cylinder at the center of the official emblem of 2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire at Pahlavi Iranian imperial era The Cyrus Cylinder was dubbed the \\"first declaration of human rights\\" by the pre-Revolution Iranian government,United Nations Note to Correspondents no. 3699, 13 October 1971 a reading prominently advanced by Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, in a 1967 book, The White Revolution of Iran. The Shah identified Cyrus as a key figure in government ideology and associated his government with the Achaemenids.Wieseh√∂fer (1999), pp. 55‚Äì68 He wrote that \\"the history of our empire began with the famous declaration of Cyrus, which, for its advocacy of humane principles, justice and liberty, must be considered one of the most remarkable documents in the history of mankind.\\" The Shah described Cyrus as the first ruler in history to give his subjects \\"freedom of opinion and other basic rights\\".Pahlavi, p. 9 In 1968, the Shah opened the first United Nations Conference on Human Rights in Tehran by saying that the Cyrus Cylinder was the precursor to the modern Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Robertson, p. 7 In his 1971 Nowruz (New Year) speech, the Shah declared that 1971 would be Cyrus the Great Year, during which a grand commemoration would be held to celebrate 2,500 years of Persian monarchy. It would serve as a showcase for a modern Iran in which the contributions that Iran had made to world civilization would be recognized. The main theme of the commemoration was the centrality of the monarchy within Iran's political system, associating the Shah of Iran with the famous monarchs of Persia's past, and with Cyrus in particular.Ansari, pp. 218‚Äì19. The Shah looked to the Achaemenid period as \\"a moment from the national past that could best serve as a model and a slogan for the imperial society he hoped to create\\".Lincoln, p. 32. The Cyrus Cylinder was adopted as the symbol for the commemoration, and Iranian magazines and journals published numerous articles about ancient Persian history. The British Museum loaned the original Cylinder to the Iranian government for the duration of the festivities; it was put on display at the Shahyad Monument (now the Azadi Tower) in Tehran.Housego (1971-10-15) The 2,500 year celebrations commenced on October 12, 1971 and culminated a week later with a spectacular parade at the tomb of Cyrus in Pasargadae. On October 14, the shah's sister, Princess Ashraf Pahlavi, presented the United Nations Secretary General U Thant with a replica of the Cylinder. The princess asserted that \\"the heritage of Cyrus was the heritage of human understanding, tolerance, courage, compassion and, above all, human liberty\\". The Secretary General accepted the gift, linking the Cylinder with the efforts of the United Nations General Assembly to address \\"the question of Respect for Human Rights in Armed Conflict\\". Since then the replica Cylinder has been kept at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City on the second floor hallway.United Nations Press Release 14 October 1971(SG/SM/1553/HQ263) The United Nations continues to promote the cylinder as \\"an ancient declaration of human rights\\".  Reception in the Islamic Republic  In September 2010, former Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad officially opened the Cyrus Cylinder exhibition at the National Museum of Iran. After the Pahlavi era, it was the second time the cylinder was brought to Iran. It was also its longest- running exhibition inside the country. Ahmadinejad considers the Cyrus Cylinder as the incarnation of human values and a cultural heritage for all humanity, and called it the \\"First Charter of Human Rights\\". The British Museum had loaned the Cyrus Cylinder to the National Museum of Iran for four months. Some Iranian politicians such as MP Ali Motahari criticized Ahmadinejad for bringing the Cyrus Cylinder to Iran, although Tehran daily Kayhan, viewed as an ultra-conservative newspaper, had opined that the Islamic Republic should never have returned the Cyrus Cylinder to Britain: At the time, the Curator of the National Museum of Iran, Azadeh Ardakani, reported approximately 48,000 visitors to the Cylinder exhibition, amongst whom over 2000 were foreigners, including foreign ambassadors.  Scholarly views  The interpretation of the Cylinder as a \\"charter of human rights\\" has been described by some historians as \\"rather anachronistic\\" and tendentious.Daniel, p. 39Briant, p. 47Llewellyn-Jones, p. 104Curtis, Tallis & Andre-Salvini, p. 59 It has been dismissed as a \\"misunderstanding\\"Mitchell, p. 83 and characterized as political propaganda devised by the Pahlavi regime. The German historian Josef Wieseh√∂fer comments that the portrayal of Cyrus as a champion of human rights is as illusory as the image of the \\"humane and enlightened Shah of Persia\\". D. Fairchild Ruggles and Helaine Silverman describe the Shah's aim as being to legitimise the Iranian nation and his own regime, and to counter the growing influence of Islamic fundamentalism by creating an alternative narrative rooted in the ancient Persian past. Writing in the immediate aftermath of the Shah's anniversary commemorations, the British Museum's C.B.F. Walker comments that the \\"essential character of the Cyrus Cylinder [is not] a general declaration of human rights or religious toleration but simply a building inscription, in the Babylonian and Assyrian tradition, commemorating Cyrus's restoration of the city of Babylon and the worship of Marduk previously neglected by Nabonidus\\". Two professors specialising in the history of the ancient Near East, Bill T. Arnold and Piotr Michalowski, comment: \\"Generically, it belongs with other foundation deposit inscriptions; it is not an edict of any kind, nor does it provide any unusual human rights declaration as is sometimes claimed.\\"Arnold, pp. 426‚Äì430 Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones of the University of Edinburgh notes that \\"there is nothing in the text\\" that suggests the concept of human rights. Neil MacGregor comments: He cautions that while the Cylinder is \\"clearly linked with the history of Iran,\\" it is \\"in no real sense an Iranian document: it is part of a much larger history of the ancient Near East, of Mesopotamian kingship, and of the Jewish diaspora\\". Some historians,Craig A. Lockard, Societies, Networks, and Transitions: A Global History: To 1500 (2007) p. 147; Yunus Jaffery, editor, History of Persian literature (1981), p. 121 (author unknown); as well as writers on human rights, have supported the interpretation of the Cyrus Cylinder as a human rights charter.Damien Kingsbury, Human Rights in Asia: A Reassessment of the Asian Values Debate (Macmillan, 2008) page 21; Sabine C. Carey, The Politics of Human Rights: The Quest for Dignity (2010) p 19; Paul Gordon Lauren, The Evolution of International Human Rights (2003) Page 11; Willem Adriaan Veenhoven, Case Studies on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms: A World Survey: Volume 1 (1975) Page 244Decolonisation, Globalisation: Language- in-Education Policy and Practice, Peter W. Martin, p. 99 W.J. Talbott, an American philosopher, believes the concept of human rights is a 20th-century concept but describes Cyrus as \\"perhaps the earliest known advocate of religious tolerance\\" and suggests that \\"ideas that led to the development of human rights are not limited to one cultural tradition.\\"Talbott, W.J. Which Rights Should be Universal?, p. 40. Oxford University Press US, 2005. The Iranian lawyer Hirad Abtahi argues that viewing the Cylinder as merely \\"an instrument of legitimizing royal rule\\" is unjustified, as Cyrus issued the document and granted those rights when he was at the height of his power, with neither popular opposition nor visible external threat to force his hand.Abtahi, pp. 1‚Äì38. A former Iranian prime minister, Hassan Pirnia, writing in the early 20th century, characterizes the Cylinder as \\"discuss[ing] human rights in a way unique for the era, dealing with ways to protect the honor, prestige, and religious beliefs of all the nations dependent to Iran in those days\\".Cited in Shabani, p. 21  Exhibition history  The Cyrus Cylinder in Room 55 of the British Museum in London The Cyrus Cylinder has been displayed in the British Museum since its formal acquisition in 1880. It has been loaned four times ‚Äì twice to Iran, between 7‚Äì22 October 1971 in conjunction with the 2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire and again from September‚ÄìDecember 2010, once to Spain from March‚ÄìJune 2006, and once to the United States in a traveling exhibition from March‚ÄìOctober 2013. Many replicas have been made. Some were distributed by the Shah following the 1971 commemorations, while the British Museum and National Museum of Iran have sold them commercially. The British Museum's ownership of the Cyrus Cylinder has been the cause of some controversy in Iran, although the artifact was obtained legally and was not excavated on Iranian soil but on former Ottoman territory (modern Iraq). When it was loaned in 1971, the Iranian press campaigned for its transfer to Iranian ownership. The Cylinder was brought back to London without difficulty, but the British Museum's Board of Trustees subsequently decided that it would be \\"undesirable to make a further loan of the Cylinder to Iran.\\" In 2005‚Äì2006 the British Museum mounted a major exhibition on the Persian Empire, Forgotten Empire: the World of Ancient Persia. It was held in collaboration with the Iranian government, which loaned the British Museum a number of iconic artefacts in exchange for an undertaking that the Cyrus Cylinder would be loaned to the National Museum of Iran in return.Jeffries (2005-10-22) The planned loan of the Cylinder was postponed in October 2009 following the June 2009 Iranian presidential election so that the British Museum could be \\"assured that the situation in the country was suitable\\".Sheikholeslami (2009-10-12) In response, the Iranian government threatened to end cooperation with the British Museum if the Cylinder was not loaned within the following two months.Wilson (2010-01-24) This deadline was postponed despite appeals by the Iranian government\\"Iran severs cultural ties with British Museum over Persian treasure (2010-02-07)\\" but the Cylinder did eventually go on display in Tehran in September 2010 for a four-month period.Cyrus Cylinder, world's oldest human rights charter, returns to Iran on loan, The Guardian (2010-09-10) The exhibition was very popular, attracting 48,000 people within the first ten days and about 500,000 people by the time it closed in January 2011.\\"Cyrus Cylinder warmly welcomed at home\\". Tehran Times, September 26, 2010 However, at its opening, Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad mingled Islamic Republican and ancient Persian symbology which commentators inside and outside Iran criticised as an overt appeal to religious nationalism.Esfandiari, Golnaz. Historic Cyrus Cylinder Called 'A Stranger In Its Own Home'. \\"Persian Letters\\", Radio Free Europe. September 14, 2010 On November 28, 2012, the BBC announced the first United States tour of the Cylinder. Under the headline ‚ÄúBritish Museum lends ancient 'bill of rights' cylinder to US‚Äù, Museum director Neil MacGregor declared that ‚ÄúThe cylinder, often referred to as the first bill of human rights, ‚Äòmust be shared as widely as possible‚Äô\\". The British Museum itself announced the news in its press release, saying \\"First declaration of human rights‚Äô to tour five cities in the United States\\". According to the British Museum's website for the Cylinder's US exhibition \\"CyrusCylinder2013.com\\", the tour started in March 2013 and included Washington DC‚Äôs Smithsonian's Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco and culminated at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, in October 2013. The cylinder, along with thirty two other associated objects from the British Museum collection, including a pair of gold armlets from the Oxus Treasure and the Darius Seal, were part of an exhibition titled 'The Cyrus Cylinder and Ancient Persia ‚Äì A New Beginning' at the Prince of Wales Museum in Mumbai, India, from December 21, 2013 to February 25, 2014. It was organised by the British Museum and the Prince of Wales Museum in partnership with Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, Sir Ratan Tata Trust and Navajbai Ratan Tata Trust, all set up by luminaries from the Parsi community, who are descendants of Persian Zoroastrians, who hold Cyrus in great regard, as many scholars consider him as a follower of Zoroastrianism.

They began studying medicine at the University of Edinburgh in 1869 and, although the court of Session ruled they should never have been admitted, and they did not graduate or qualify as doctors, the campaign they fought gained national attention and won them many supporters, including Charles Darwin. Their campaign put the demands of women for a university education on the national political agenda, which eventually resulted in legislation to ensure that women could study medicine at university in 1876 (UK Medical Act 1876). The group was also called the Septem contra Edinam (\\"Seven against Edinburgh\\", in reference to the Seven against Thebes of Greek mythology). Although over the four-year campaign some of the original seven left and others joined, the following women became known as the Edinburgh Seven: * Sophia Jex-Blake * Isabel Thorne * Edith Pechey * Matilda Chaplin * Helen Evans * Mary Anderson * Emily Bovell They were the seven women listed in the petition to the Royal Infirmary on 15 November 1870 requesting admission to clinical teaching. They were all registered in the GMC Medical Students Register between 1869 and 1870 as bona fide medical students and required clinical instruction at the Infirmary in order to fulfil the requirements of a medical degree.  The start of the Edinburgh campaign  Sophia Jex-Blake applied to study medicine in March 1869 and although the Medical Faculty and the Senatus Academus voted in favour of allowing her to study medicine, the University Court rejected her application on the grounds that the university could not make the necessary arrangements 'in the interest of one lady' Jex- Blake then advertised in The Scotsman and other national newspapers for more women to join her. The first two women to write to her were Isabel Thorne and Edith Pechey. Edith Pechey‚Äôs letter read: This modest letter did not do justice to her intellectual ability ‚Äì see below. A second application was submitted in the summer of 1869 on behalf of a group of five women. It requested matriculation and all that that implied ‚Äì the right to attend all the classes and examinations required for a degree in medicine. This application was approved by the University Court, by which time the group had grown to seven. The women set up home in 15 Buccleuch Place, now home to the University of Edinburgh‚Äôs Student Experience Office, and began preparing for the matriculation exam.  The matriculation examination of 1869  The examination was in two parts. English, Latin and mathematics were compulsory subjects; in addition, each candidate had to choose two subjects from a group that included Greek, French, German, higher mathematics, natural philosophy, logic and moral philosophy. Sophia Jex-Blake acted as mathematics tutor to the other women. Of the 152 candidates who sat the exam on 19 October 1869, five were women. Four of the women came in the top seven places.  The first women undergraduates in Britain  On 2 November 1869 the women signed the matriculation roll. In so doing, the University of Edinburgh became the first British university to open its doors to women. Jex-Blake wrote in one of her letters to her friend Lucy Sewell: One of the historic documents in the campaign is the Edinburgh University Calendar for 1870. It contained a new section, which appeared under the heading Regulations for the Education of Women in Medicine in the University. It stated that the women would receive all their tuition in classes separate from those for men and would pay higher fees due to their classes being smaller. In all other respects the women were to be treated exactly as the men were, 'subject to all the regulations now or at any future time in force in the University as to the matriculation of students, their attendance on classes, examinations or otherwise.'  The Hope Scholarship  In March 1870, the women sat the first examinations in physiology and chemistry. Not only did they all pass, but four of them had obtained honours in both subjects. Edith Pechey, who had written the humble letter to Sophia Jex-Blake (see above), had won first place amongst the candidates sitting the exam for the first time and so had first claim on a Hope Scholarship. This scholarship, which had been instituted 40 years previously by the Professor of Chemistry, Thomas Charles Hope, was awarded to the four students coming top in the exam, sitting it for the first time. Dr Crum-Brown, the current Professor of Chemistry, had at first been pleased to help the women students, but had observed growing resentment towards them from colleagues in the Medical Faculty, in particular the influential Sir Robert Christison. He was also concerned that awarding the scholarship to a woman would be seen as a provocation to the male students. He therefore decided to award the scholarships to male students who got lower marks than the women.  Hostility towards the women grows  Professor Robert Christison was one of the women's vehement opponents. A debate was held in April 1870 by the University Court to decide on whether the women should be allowed in mixed classes (and thereby be fully equal to the male students, reducing the significantly higher fees they were paying and making them eligible to win prizes too). During this debate, Prof. Robert Christison and Prof. Laycock expressed views that gained the attention of the national press, which came down in support of the women. The Times commented, Laycock had suggested that women seeking medical careers might be \\"basely inclined\\" or might be \\"Magdalenes\\". The Times had wondered why he might not equally be concerned about male students. Robert Christison had questioned the validity of the belief that women patients would want women doctors, his own enquiries leading him to believe the opposite to be true. He concluded his argument by saying \\"Become Midwives, not doctors!\\" It was Christison's influence that saw many faculty staff who had initially been supportive of the women turn away from teaching them throughout the rest of 1870. A growing proportion of the male students began to be offensive and insolent, shutting doors in the women's faces, crowding into seats that they usually sat in, bursting into \\"horse laughs and howls\\" whenever the women approached. Jex-Blake later wrote that it was \\"as if a conspiracy had been formed to make our position as uncomfortable as might be\\". She catalogued the abuse: her doorbell was \\"wrenched off\\" and her nameplate damaged five times; a Catherine wheel was attached to her door; smoke was blown in their faces; filthy letters were sent; they were waylaid in quiet streets; obscenities were shouted at them in public. Edith Pechey, in a letter to The Scotsman, also spoke of being followed in the streets and having \\"the foulest epithets\\", such as \\"whore\\", shouted at her. Friends and supporters believed that some of the professors were deliberately inciting the students to behave in this way. The women began to take precautions, and only walking around campus as a group but none of them were prepared for the events that took place on Friday 18 November 1870.  The Surgeon's Hall riot  At four o'clock in the afternoon on Friday 18 November 1870 the women were due to sit an anatomy exam at Surgeons' Hall. As they approached they found that Nicholson Street was blocked by a crowd of several hundred. When the women were seen approaching, a large number of the gathered crowd began pelting them with rubbish and mud as well as shouting abuse and insults at them. They made their way to the main entrance of Surgeons' Hall only to have the gates slammed in their faces. They endured the hostility of the crowd until a sympathetic student came to their rescue and opened the front gates for them. At the end of the exam, the women declined the offer of leaving via a side entrance onto the street. The Surgeon's Hall Riot, as it has now become known, was a landmark in the history of the medical women's campaign and attracted widespread publicity. It won the women many new friends and sympathisers. It also galvanised support from some male students, who were shocked by the way the women were treated that day. The supportive students began to act as bodyguards to the women, escorting them back to 15 Buccleuch Place at the end of the examination that day. For many weeks after, they would come and pick the women up from their home and escort them to and from classes. The controversy continued in the press. The article Female Education in Medicine in \\"The Edinburgh University Magazine\\" of February 1871 discussed the arguments for and against admitting women to study medicine. It also discussed as the monetary considerations for professors' renumeration and the lack of beds in the Edinburgh Infirmary to be shared with the male students. The article recommends that \\"these female students offer their services as students, dressers, and clerks to one of our great parochial hospitals, Craiglockhart or Craigleith.\\" It concludes that: \\"Let us here, however, simply in self-defence state our firm belief that it is a sign not of advancing but of decaying civilisation when women force themselves into competition with the other sex.\\"\\"Female Education in Medicine\\" in The Edinburgh University Magazine, No. 11, pp. 32‚Äì34 (February 1871) The defamation case and the national campaign Later, the Sheriff fined three \\"disorderly\\" students ¬£1 each for \\"breach of the peace\\".The Scotsman 23 November 1870 Jex-Blake said the young men had been encouraged by a teaching assistant, but lost when he sued her for defamation. Other women had joined their classes, some doctors had taught them gladly, and supporters had formed a General Committee for Securing a Complete Medical Education for Women with a membership of over 300, including Charles Darwin. Yet in the end they lost the battle to graduate. In 1873 the Court of Session supported the University's right to refuse the women degrees. They also ruled, by a majority, that the women should not have been admitted in the first place. This defeat and their other struggles motivated most of them to continue, not only for personal reasons, but as part of a wider cause. After 1873 Sophia Jex-Blake soon moved to London to campaign there. She was active in establishing the London School of Medicine for Women, which opened in autumn 1874 with twelve of its fourteen students having previously studied in Edinburgh. Six of the original \\"Seven\\" attended the School. Isabel Thorne was an asset to its smooth running since she was more diplomatic than Jex-Blake. She became the honorary secretary of the School, but gave up her own plan to practise as a doctor. Matriculation Signatures: Sophia Jex-Blake, Mary Pechey, Helen Evans, Matilda Chaplin Five of the original seven ‚Äì Bovell, Chaplin, Jex-Blake, Marshall and Pechey ‚Äì were granted MDs abroad in the later 1870s, either in Bern or Paris. In 1876 new legislation enabled, but did not compel, examining bodies to treat candidates of both sexes equally. The Irish College of Physicians (then called the Kings and Queens College of Physicians) was the first to start granting medical practice licences to women: an opportunity for four of the newly qualified women. In 1878 Jex-Blake returned to Edinburgh and set up at Manor Place in the New Town as the city's first woman doctor. She also established a clinic for poor patients which was the forerunner of Bruntsfield Hospital. Once Scotland started licensing women doctors, Jex-Blake helped found the Edinburgh School of Medicine for Women, with clinical practice taking place at Leith Hospital. Edith Pechey practised in Leeds before becoming senior medical officer at the new Cama women and children's hospital in Bombay (now Mumbai). Bovell and Marshall worked at the New Hospital for Women in London. Chaplin founded a midwifery school in Tokyo, but later returned to private practice in London. Edinburgh University and the other Scottish universities eventually admitted women undergraduates in 1892 after the Universities (Scotland) Act of 1889 established a legal framework for this. All classes were co-educational except for medical classes. Tributes Historic Scotland commemorative plaque to the Edinburgh Seven and the Surgeons' Hall riot In 2015 the Edinburgh Seven were commemorated with a plaque at Edinburgh University, as part of the Historic Scotland Commemorative Plaques Scheme. In 2019, Edinburgh Medical School awarded the Edinburgh Seven the posthumous honorary degree of MBChB. Seven female students received the certificates on behalf of the Edinburgh Seven. The graduation ceremony was part of a series of events to honour their achievements. =In fiction= In Charles Reade's novel, A Woman- Hater (1877), Rhoda Gould tells the story of the Edinburgh Seven in some detail, as if she had been one of them: \\"We were seven ladies, who wished to be doctresses, especially devoted to our own sex . . .\\". While the 'woman- hating' character of Vizard has to be persuaded of Rhoda's potential to do good, Reade's own attitude is sympathetic: \\" . . . it matters greatly to mankind whether the whole race of women are to be allowed to study medicine and practice it\\".

The parish is noted for its association with the philosopher John Locke. History High Laver is historically a rural agricultural parish, predominantly arable. In 1086 there were 1428 acres of arable land, woodland for 200 pigs and 37¬Ω acres of meadow. The 1881 census data collected indicates that the majority of the male population were employed in agriculture. High Laver school was founded 1866 with accommodation for 75 children. At one point the school breached its capacity with a total of 132 pupils attending. Pupils of High Laver today typically attend Magdalen Laver school, west from High Laver. The manor of Otes may originally have been part of Little Laver. It was purchased around 1614 by William Masham, and passed to his son Sir William Masham, 1st Baronet When John Locke, British philosopher, died in 1704, he was buried at High Laver, where he had lived at Otes as a paying guest in the household of Sir Francis Masham, 3rd Baronet since 1691. In 1887 John Bartholomew, in the Gazetteer of the British Isles, wrote: \\"Laver, High, par., Essex, in NW. of co., 4 m. NW. of Ongar, 1891 ac., pop. 477; the churchyard contains the grave of John Locke (1632‚Äì1704), the philosopher\\". Geography High Laver village is situated 4 miles (6.4 km) east of Harlow and 1.4 miles (2.2 km) north-west of Moreton. The land is nearly 300 ft. (90 m.) above sea-level in the south-west, about 250 ft. (75 m.) in the north and 230 ft. (70 m.) in the east. Demography \\"In 1801 the population was 346. By 1851 it had grown to 534. It was a little below this level until the last decade of the century when there was a sharp decline to 386. In the first half of the 20th century it rose gradually to 463 in 1951\\" According to 2011 census data High Laver had a population of 493 persons across 200 households. Within High Laver 260 persons out of the 493 who participated in the 2011 census aged 16 to 74 are in employment. The 1881 census data indicates that the majority of the Male population of High Laver were employed in agriculture, this is typical of Parishes at this time due to the surrounding countryside being ideal for farming. 2011 census data indicates that 260 16- to 74-year-olds are in employment out of the total population of 493. The demographics in High Laver are fairly uneven according to the 2011 census data; the data indicates that the largest demographic are the 45 to 59's.

A graph to show the demographics of high laver using data from the 2011 Census Landmarks All Saints' Church in High Laver consists of a nave, chancel, west tower, south porch, and north vestry. The church was constructed from flint and rubble during the late 12th century; there also remains evidence that some Roman bricks and tiles were used as they are visible among the chancel walls, and also the north wall of the nave. Over the years there has been refurbishment and maintenance on the church. In the 15th or 16th century the roofs of the chancel and nave, which are ceiled in except for the plates and tie-beams, were renewed. Within the tower there is a font with an octagonal bowl which dates from the 14th century. Outside the south wall of the nave is the brick altar tomb of the philosopher John Locke (1704). A mural tablet, originally above the tomb, was moved inside the church for preservation in 1932. The grave of Abigail Masham, Baroness Masham, a favourite of Queen Anne and a cousin of Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, is also found in the churchyard. The complex relationship between these three women is dramatised in the film The Favourite. Transport The main road from Ongar to Harlow which is a key transport route enters the parish at High Laver Bridge. High Laver lies near junction seven of the M11 motorway. There are three bus services that run through the parish, four days a week. The nearest train station is Harlow Town.

Due to his persistence and planning, the annual Breslover Rosh Hashana kibbutz (prayer gathering) at the grave of Rebbe Nachman of Breslov in Uman, Ukraine, which began in 1811, continued in secret despite the Communist ban on religious gatherings. Biography Dorfman was born in Kamenetz-Podolsk in western Ukraine and became a Breslover Hasid in his early teens. He moved to Uman and became a close student of Rabbi Abraham Sternhartz, a leading Breslover figure. In February 1930 he married the granddaughter of Sternhartz, Rivkah, who was a descendant of Rabbi Nathan of Breslov through both her mother and father. During the Stalinist purges of the Ukraine in the late 1930s, Dorfman escaped to Leningrad, where he and his wife survived World War II. However, after the war he was arrested by the NKVD and incarcerated in Lubyanka prison in Moscow for two years and then exiled to Siberia for another five and a half years. Upon the death of Stalin in 1953, he was given a reprieve and allowed to settle in Moscow. Dorfman was certified as a shochet (ritual slaughterer) by the Rabbi of Poltava. He alternately supported his family as a tailor, shoemaker, and bookbinder during his years in Russia. Breslov leader After World War II, the few remaining Breslover Hasidim in Russia moved far away from the government center in Moscow, to areas such as Tashkent, where religious practices were still forbidden but government scrutiny was less intense. During the year, these scattered Hasidim did not keep in contact with each other. However, before each Rosh Hashanah, they would go to public pay phones to call Dorfman in Moscow, who updated them on details of the upcoming holiday pilgrimage to Uman. Dorfman also corresponded with Hasidim who lived in remote areas, encouraging them to come to Uman. Dorfman served as one of the prayer leaders at the secret Rosh Hashanah services, which were held every year in a house near Rebbe Nachman's gravesite. In contrast to the hundreds of Hasidim who participated in the Rosh Hashana kibbutz during the nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, only enough men for a minyan (prayer quorum of 10 men) risked their lives to make the annual pilgrimage during and after the Stalinist regime. Foreign tourists to Rebbe Nachman's gravesite In the mid-1960s Dorfman began escorting American citizens to Uman to show them Rebbe Nachman's gravesite. During World War II, a fierce battle between the Russians and Nazis for control of Uman had demolished the ancient cemetery in which Rebbe Nachman was buried. The cemetery was razed and housing lots were constructed on it. The grave of Rebbe Nachman was rediscovered and a private house built directly adjacent protected it from desecration. Only with the aid of someone like Dorfman, who traveled to the gravesite several times a year, could foreigners hope to locate it. By aiding foreign tourists, Dorfman placed himself in great personal danger. The government only issued tourist visas to large cities like Kiev or Odessa, not to Uman; thus, Dorfman was aiding illegal tourists. Due to his efforts, however, several hundred American and Israeli citizens were able to visit Uman. The increasing number of visitors and requests for visas to Uman in the 1960s, '70s, and '80s put pressure on the Soviet government to ease its restrictions. Finally the gates opened entirely with the fall of Communism in 1989. Aliyah to Israel After 38 consecutive years of petitioning the government through official and private channels, Dorfman and his wife finally received their exit visas in 1972 and immigrated to Israel. Dorfman was appointed by Rabbi Levi Yitzchok Bender as Rosh Yeshiva of the Breslov Yeshiva in Meah Shearim. He died on 5 Av 5766 (July 30, 2006). References *Fleer, Gedaliah (2005). Against All Odds.

In 1980, Hill was arrested on narcotics charges and became an FBI informant. He testified against his former Mafia associates, resulting in 50 convictions, including those of caporegime (captain) Paul Vario and James Burke on multiple charges. He had entered the Witness Protection Program in 1980, but was removed from the program in the early 1990s. Hill's life story was documented in the true crime book Wiseguy: Life in a Mafia Family by Nicholas Pileggi, which was subsequently adapted by Martin Scorsese into the critically acclaimed film Goodfellas in 1990. Hill was portrayed by Ray Liotta in the film. Early life Henry Hill Jr. was born on June 11, 1943, in the Manhattan borough of New York City, to Henry Hill Sr., an immigrant Irish electrician, and Carmela Costa Hill, a Sicilian American. The working-class family, consisting of Henry and his seven other siblings, grew up in Brownsville, a working-class neighborhood of Brooklyn. From an early age, Hill admired the local mobsters who socialized at a dispatch cabstand across the street from his home, including Paul Vario, a caporegime in the Lucchese crime family. In 1955, when Hill was 11 years old, he wandered into the cabstand looking for a part-time after-school job. In his early teens, Hill began running errands for patrons of Vario's storefront shoeshine, pizzeria, and cabstand. He first met the notorious hijacker and Lucchese family associate James \\"Jimmy the Gent\\" Burke in 1956. The 13-year-old Hill served drinks and sandwiches at a card game and was dazzled by Burke's openhanded tipping: \\"He was sawbucking me to death. Twenty here. Twenty there. He wasn't like anyone else I had ever met.\\" Hill was dyslexic. The following year, Vario's younger brother, Vito \\"Tuddy\\" Vario, and Vario's son, Lenny Vario, presented Hill with a highly sought-after union card in the bricklayers' local. Hill would be a \\"no show\\" and put on a building contractor's construction payroll, guaranteeing him a weekly salary of $190 (). This didn't mean Hill would be getting or keeping all that money every week, however; he received a portion of it, and the rest was kept and divided among the Varios. The card also allowed Hill to facilitate the pickup of daily policy bets and loan payments to Vario from local construction sites. Once Hill had this \\"legitimate\\" job, he dropped out of high school, working exclusively for the Vario gangsters.Pileggi, p. 24 Hill's first encounter with arson occurred when a rival cabstand opened just around the corner from Vario's business. The competing company's owner was from Alabama, new to New York City. Sometime after midnight, Tuddy and Hill drove to the rival cabstand with a drum full of gasoline in the back seat of Tuddy's car. Hill smashed the cab windows and filled them with gasoline-soaked newspapers, then tossed in lit matchbooks.Pileggi, p. 28 Hill was first arrested when he was 16; his arrest record is one of the few official documents that prove his existence.Pileggi, p. 3. Hill and Lenny, Vario's equally underage son, attempted to use a stolen credit card to buy snow tires for Tuddy's wife's car. When Hill and Lenny returned to Tuddy's, two police detectives apprehended Hill. During a rough interrogation, Hill gave his name and nothing else; Vario's attorney later facilitated his release on bail. While a suspended sentence resulted, Hill's refusal to talk earned him the respect of both Vario and Burke. Burke, in particular, saw great potential in Hill. Like Burke, he was of Irish ancestry and therefore ineligible to become a \\"made man\\". The Vario Crew, however, were happy to have associates of any ethnicity, so long as they made money and refused to cooperate with the authorities.Pileggi, p. 30. In June 1960, at around 17 years old, Hill joined the United States Army, serving with the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg in North Carolina. Hill claimed the timing was deliberate; the FBI investigation into the 1957 Apalachin mob summit meeting had prompted a Senate investigation into organized crime, and its links with businesses and unions. This resulted in the publication of a list of nearly 5,000 names of members and associates of the five major crime families. Hill searched through a partial list but could not find Vario listed among the Lucchese family.Pileggi, p. 41. Throughout his three-year enlistment, Hill maintained his mob contacts. He also continued to hustle: in charge of kitchen detail, he sold surplus food, loan sharked pay advances to fellow soldiers, and sold tax-free cigarettes. Before his discharge, Hill spent two months in the stockade for stealing a local sheriff's car, and brawling in a bar with a civilian and Marines. In 1963, Hill returned to New York and began the most notorious phase of his criminal career: arson, intimidation,Pileggi, p. 55. running an organized stolen car ring,Pileggi, p. 58. and hijacking trucks.Pileggi, p. 136. In 1965, Hill met his future wife, Karen Friedman, through Paul Vario, who insisted that Hill accompany him on a double date at Frank \\"Frankie the Wop\\" Manzo's restaurant, Villa Capra. According to Friedman, the date was disastrous, and Hill stood her up at the next dinner date. Afterward, the two began going on dates at the Copacabana and other nightclubs, where Friedman was introduced to Hill's outwardly impressive lifestyle. The two later got married in a large North Carolina wedding, attended by most of Hill's gangster friends.Pileggi, pp. 83-94 In 1994, Hill, in his book Gangsters and Goodfellas, stated that Tommy DeSimone tried to rape Karen.  Air France robbery  On the day of the robbery, Hill and Tommy DeSimone drove to the Air France cargo terminal at John F. Kennedy International Airport with an empty suitcase, the largest Hill could find. At 11:40 p.m, they entered the Air France cargo terminal. McMahon said that they should just walk in, as people often came to the terminal to pick up lost baggage. DeSimone and Hill entered the unsecured area unchallenged. They unlocked the door with the duplicate key. Using a small flashlight, they found seven of the bags, which they loaded into the suitcase and left; $420,000 was taken. No alarm was raised, no shots fired, and no one was injured. The theft was not discovered until the following Monday, when a Wells Fargo truck arrived to pick up the cash to be delivered to the French American Banking Corporation. Hill believed it was the Air France robbery that endeared him to the Mafia.  Restaurant ownership and murder of William \\"Billy Batts\\" Bentvena  Hill used his share of the robbery proceeds to purchase a restaurant on Queens Boulevard, The Suite, initially aiming to run it as a legitimate business and provide \\"distance\\" between himself and his mob associates. However, within several months, the nightclub had become another mob hangout. Hill later said that members of Lucchese and Gambino crews moved into the club en masse, including high-ranking Gambino family members who \\"were always there\\". After William \\"Billy Batts\\" Bentvena was released from prison in 1970, in the book Wiseguy, Hill said that they threw a \\"welcome home\\" party for Bentvena at Robert's Lounge, which was owned by Jimmy Burke. Hill stated that Bentvena saw Tommy DeSimone and jokingly asked him if he still shined shoes and DeSimone perceived it as an insult. DeSimone leaned over to Hill and Burke and said \\"I'm gonna kill that fuck.\\" Two weeks later, on June 11, 1970, Bentvena was at The Suite, a nightclub owned by Hill in Jamaica, Queens. Late in the night, with the bar club nearly empty, DeSimone pistol-whipped Bentvena. Hill said that before DeSimone started to beat Bentvena, DeSimone yelled, \\"Shine these fucking shoes!\\" After Bentvena was beaten and presumed killed, DeSimone, Burke, and Hill placed his body in the trunk of Hill's car for transport. They stopped at DeSimone's mother's house to get a shovel and lime. They started to hear sounds from the trunk, and when they realized that Bentvena was still alive, DeSimone and Burke stopped the car and beat him to death with the shovel and a tire iron. Burke had a friend who owned a dog kennel in Upstate New York, and Bentvena was buried there. About three months after Bentvena's murder, Burke's friend sold the dog kennel to housing developers, and Burke ordered Hill and DeSimone to exhume Bentvena's corpse and dispose of it elsewhere. In Wiseguy, Hill said the body was eventually crushed in a mechanical compactor at a New Jersey junkyard, which was owned by Clyde Brooks. However, on the commentary for the film Goodfellas, he states that Bentvena's body was buried in the basement of Robert's Lounge, a bar and restaurant owned by Burke, and only later was put into the car crusher. Drug business In November 1972, Burke and Hill were arrested for beating Gaspar Ciaccio in Tampa, Florida. Ciaccio allegedly owed a large gambling debt to their friend, union boss Casey Rosado. They were charged with extortion, convicted, and sentenced to 10 years in the United States Penitentiary in Lewisburg. He was imprisoned with Vario, who was serving a sentence for tax evasion, and several Gotti crew members. In Lewisburg, Hill met a man from Pittsburgh who, for a fee, taught Hill how to smuggle drugs into the prison. On July 12, 1978, Hill was paroled after four years and resumed his criminal career. Hill began trafficking in drugs, and Burke was soon involved with this new enterprise, even though the Lucchese crime family, with whom they were associated, did not authorize any of its members to deal drugs. This Lucchese ban was enacted because the prison sentences imposed on anyone convicted of drug trafficking were so lengthy that the accused would often become informants in exchange for a lesser sentence. This is exactly what Hill eventually did, becoming an informant against Burke after several years selling drugs. Hill began wholesaling marijuana, cocaine, heroin, and quaaludes based on connections he made in prison; he earned enormous amounts of money. A young kid who was a \\"mule\\" of Hill's \\"ratted\\" Hill out to Narcotics Detectives Daniel Mann and William Broder. \\"The Youngster\\" (so named by the detectives) informed them that the supplier [Henry Hill] was connected to the Lucchese crime family and was a close friend to Paul Vario and to Jimmy Burke and \\"had probably been in on the Lufthansa robbery\\". Knowing who Hill was and what he did, they put surveillance on him, taking pictures. They found out that Hill's old prison friend from Pittsburgh ran a dog-grooming salon as a front. Mann and Broder had \\"thousands\\" of wiretaps of Hill. But Hill and his crew used coded language in the conversations. Hill's wiretap on March 29 is an example of the bizarre vocabulary: Lufthansa heist The Lufthansa heist was a robbery at John F. Kennedy International Airport on December 11, 1978. An estimated $5.875 million (equivalent to $ million in ) was stolen from the German airline Lufthansa, with $5 million in cash and $875,000 in jewelry, making it the largest cash robbery committed on American soil at the time. The plot had begun when bookmaker Martin Krugman told Hill Lufthansa flew in currency to its cargo terminal at John F. Kennedy International Airport; Jimmy Burke set the plan in motion. Hill did not directly take part in the heist. Basketball fixing Hill and two Pittsburgh gamblers set up the 1978‚Äì79 Boston College basketball point-shaving scheme by convincing Boston College center Rick Kuhn to participate. Kuhn, who was a high school friend of one of the gamblers, encouraged teammates to participate in the scheme. Hill also claimed to have an NBA referee in his pocket who worked games at Madison Square Garden during the 1970s. The referee had incurred gambling debts on horse races. 1980 arrest In 1980, Hill was arrested on a narcotics-trafficking charge. He became convinced that his former associates planned to have him killed: Vario, for dealing drugs; and Burke, to prevent Hill from implicating him in the Lufthansa heist. Hill heard on a wiretap that his associates Angelo Sepe and Anthony Stabile were anxious to have him killed, and that they were telling Burke that Hill \\"is no good\\", and that he \\"is a junkie\\". Burke told them \\"not to worry about it\\". Hill was more convinced by a surveillance tape played to him by federal investigators, in which Burke tells Vario of their need to have Hill \\"whacked.\\" When Hill was finally released on bail, Burke told Hill they should meet at a bar, which Hill had never heard of or seen before, owned by \\"Charlie the Jap.‚Äù However, Hill never met Burke there; instead they met at Burke's sweatshop with Karen and asked for the address in Florida where Hill was to kill Bobby Germaine's son with Anthony Stabile. Hill knew he would be murdered if he went to Florida. Head of the Brooklyn Organized Crime Strike Force, Edward McDonald arrested Hill as a material witness in the Lufthansa robbery. With a long sentence hanging over him, Hill agreed to become an informant and signed an agreement with the Strike Force on May 27, 1980. Gives most of the arrest story. Informant and the witness protection program Hill testified against his former associates to avoid impending prosecution and being murdered by his crew. His testimony led to 50 convictions. Hill, his wife Karen, and their two children (Gregg and Gina) entered the U.S. Marshals' Witness Protection Program in 1980, changed their names, and moved around to several undisclosed locations including Seattle, Washington; Cincinnati, Ohio; Omaha, Nebraska; Butte, Montana; and Independence, Kentucky. Jimmy Burke was given 12 years in prison for the 1978‚Äì79 Boston College point-shaving scandal, involving fixing Boston College basketball games. Burke was also later sentenced to life in prison for the murder of scam artist Richard Eaton. Burke died of cancer while serving his life sentence, on April 13, 1996, at the age of 64. Paul Vario received four years for helping Henry Hill obtain a no-show job to get him paroled from prison. Vario was also later sentenced to ten years in prison for the extortion of air freight companies at JFK Airport. He died of respiratory failure on November 22, 1988, at age 73 while incarcerated in the FCI Federal Prison in Fort Worth.Obituary in The New York Times: Paul Vario, 73; Called a Leader Of Crime Group =Hill's subsequent arrests and divorce= In 1987, Hill was convicted of cocaine trafficking in a federal court in Seattle and expelled from the witness protection program. In 1990, his wife Karen had filed for divorce after 23 years of marriage. The divorce was finalized in 2002. In August 2004, Hill was arrested in North Platte, Nebraska at North Platte Regional Airport after he had left his luggage containing drug paraphernalia. On September 26, 2005, he was sentenced to 180 days' imprisonment for attempted methamphetamine possession. Hill was sentenced to two years of probation on March 26, 2009, after he pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts of public intoxication. On December 14, 2009, he was arrested in Fairview Heights, Illinois, for disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, which Hill attributed to his drinking problems. Later years In his later years, after his first divorce, he married Kelly Alor, followed by his fianc√©e, Lisa Caserta, where they lived in Topanga Canyon, near Malibu, California. Both appeared in several documentaries and made public appearances on various media programs including The Howard Stern Show. Hill fathered a third child during this time. =Goodfellas film= Goodfellas, the 1990 Martin Scorsese-directed crime film adaptation of the 1985 non-fiction book Wiseguy by Nicholas Pileggi, follows the 1955 to 1980 rise and fall of Hill and his Lucchese crime family associates. Hill was portrayed by Ray Liotta. Scorsese initially named the film Wise Guy but subsequently, with Pileggi's agreement, changed the name to Goodfellas to avoid confusion with the unrelated television crime drama Wiseguy. Two weeks in advance of the filming, Hill was paid $480,000. Robert De Niro, who portrayed Jimmy Burke, often called Hill several times a day to ask how Burke walked, held his cigarette, and so on. Driving to and from the set, Liotta listened to FBI audio cassette tapes of Hill, so he could practice speaking like his real-life counterpart. The cast did not meet Hill until a few weeks before the film's premiere. Liotta met him in an undisclosed city; Hill had seen the film and told the actor that he loved it. =Other media appearances and activity= The 1990 film My Blue Heaven was based on Hill's life, with the screenplay written by Pileggi's wife Nora Ephron. The 2001 TV film The Big Heist was based on the Lufthansa heist, and Hill was portrayed by Nick Sandow. In 2004, Hill was interviewed by Charlie Rose for 60 Minutes. July 24, 2010 marked the twentieth anniversary of the release of Goodfellas. This milestone was celebrated with a private screening hosted by Hill for a select group of invitees at the Museum of the American Gangster. On June 8, 2011, a show about Hill's life aired on the National Geographic Channel's Locked Up Abroad. In 2006, Hill and Ray Liotta appeared in a photo shoot for Entertainment Weekly. At Liotta's urging, Hill entered alcohol rehabilitation two days after the session shoot. In reference to his many victims, Hill stated in an interview in March 2008, with the BBC's Heather Alexander: \\"I don't give a heck what those people think; I'm doing the right thing now\\", addressing the reporter's question about how his victims might think of his commercialization of his story through self-written books and advising on Goodfellas. In 2008, Hill was featured in episode three of the crime documentary series The Irish Mob. In the episode, Hill recounts his life of crime, as well as his close relationship with Jimmy Burke and the illegal activity the two engaged in together. A large portion of the segment focuses on Burke's and Hill's involvements in the famous Lufthansa heist. In August 2011, Hill appeared in the special \\"Mob Week\\" on AMC; he and other former mob members talked about The Godfather, Goodfellas, and other such mob films. In 2014, the ESPN-produced 30 for 30 series debuted Playing for the Mob, the story about how Hill and his Pittsburgh associates, and several Boston College basketball players, committed the point-shaving scandal during the 1978‚Äì79 season, an episode briefly mentioned in the movie. The documentary, narrated by Liotta, was set up so that the viewer needed to watch the film beforehand, to understand many of the references in the story. =Books= In October 2002, Hill published The Wiseguy Cookbook: My Favorite Recipes From My Life As a Goodfella To Cooking On the Run. In it, Hill shared some stories throughout his childhood, life in the mob, and running from the law. He also presents recipes he learned from his family, during his years in the mob, and some that he came up with himself. For example, Hill claimed his last meal the day he was busted for drugs consisted of rolled veal cutlets, sauce with pork butt, veal shanks, ziti, and green beans with olive oil and garlic. In 2012, Henry Hill collaborated with the author, Daniel Simone, in writing and developing a non-fiction book titled, The Lufthansa Heist, a portrayal of the famous 1978 Lufthansa Airline robbery at Kennedy Airport. The book was published in August 2015. Other books by Hill include: * * =Restaurants= Hill worked for a time as a chef at an Italian restaurant in North Platte, Nebraska, and his spaghetti sauce, Sunday Gravy, was marketed over the internet. Hill opened another restaurant, Wiseguys, in West Haven, Connecticut, in October 2007, which closed the following month after a fire. Death Hill died of complications related to heart disease in a Los Angeles hospital, on June 12, 2012, after a long battle with his illness, a day after his 69th birthday. His girlfriend for the last six years of his life, Lisa Caserta, said, \\"He had been sick for a long time. ... his heart gave out\\". CBS News aired Caserta's report of Hill's death, during which she stated: \\"he went out pretty peacefully, for a goodfella.\\" She said Hill had recently suffered a heart attack before his death and died of complications after a long history of heart problems associated with smoking. Hill's family was present when he died. Ray Liotta, who portrayed Hill in Goodfellas, stated on Hill's death: \\"Although I played Henry Hill in the movie Goodfellas, I only met him a few short times so I can't say I knew him but I do know he lived a complicated life.\\" Hill was cremated the day after his death.

Description  Gelli The river has two major tributaries, the Rhondda Fawr and the Rhondda Fach (respectively, the \\"big\\" and the \\"little\\" Rhondda). Despite these names, both tributaries are of similar length. Both valleys display the U-shape cross-sections typical of glaciated valleys, having been eroded during successive ice ages. They cut deeply into the thick South Wales Coal measures which comprise sandstones and mudstones and coal seams of Carboniferous age. The whole form of the river and its surrounding urbanisation has been dominated by coal mining and the communities that grew up to exploit the rich coal seams. Much of the valley has suffered severe subsidence because of the removal of coal from beneath the valley floor. The houses and streets have subsided with the result that river levels are, in parts, higher than the surrounding houses. In order to contain the river and prevent flooding, walls have been built, sometimes across the ends of streets - these are known as \\"The Rhondda walls\\".  Course  The Rhondda Fawr has its source on the eastern side of Craig y Llyn south of Llyn Fawr in a spring called Ffynnon y Gwalciau at an elevation of about 544m OD. The main head stream, Nant Carn Moesen (or Nant Carfoesen) runs down a plateau slope for about a mile and drops steeply, joining with the Nant Garreg-lwyd and the Nant Melyn to form the Rhondda.Ordnance Survey 1:25,000 scale Explorer map sheet 166 Rhondda & Merthyr Tydfil/Merthyr Tudful The combined waters then continue descending sharply through a mountain gorge to the foot of Pen Pych.Lewis (1959), pg 1. The river runs through Blaenrhondda where it is joined by the Nant y Gwair, and runs down the Rhondda Valley, (). The river then passes through a string of mining towns and villages including Treherbert, Treorchy, Pentre, Ton Pentre, Ystrad Rhondda, Llwynypia, Tonypandy (joined by the Nant Clydach), Dinas and Porth where it joins its sister tributary. The Rhondda Fach rises about a mile to the east of the source of the Rhondda Fawr on the hills above Blaenrhondda in a marshy area between Mynydd Beili Glas and Mynydd Bwllfa at an elevation of 489m OD.Lewis (1959), pg 2. The fledgling river is first contained in the Lluest-wen Reservoir before flowing down into Maerdy and then on through Ferndale, Tylorstown, Ynyshir to its confluence at Porth. The River Rhondda flows on past Trehafod to reach its confluence with the River Taff at Pontypridd.  Improving water quality  The mining industry had a catastrophic impact on the quality of the river with all the mine waters being pumped straight into the river with no treatment. For very long periods, probably more than a century, the river was continuously black with coal solids and little if anything could live in the river. This was compounded by the very basic sewage disposal arrangements which saw all the sewage discharged into the same river. Not until the 1970s was there real investment made in improving the sewage treatment arrangements. Since the early 1970s the river has been steadily improving in quality largely due to the closure of all the coal mines and through the investment in sewerage and sewage treatment.

He is currently the president of the London Center for Policy Research. Shaffer enlisted in the Ohio Army National Guard in 1980 and graduated from Officer Candidate School in 1982. He received his B.A. in political science and environmental studies from Wright State University in 1986. 9/11 hijacker claims After coming under investigation over an alleged pattern of misconduct while deployed as a staff officer in Afghanistan (long-distance phone charges he incurred for personal calls), Shaffer responded by alleging that the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) failed to properly pass on intelligence on 9/11 hijacker Mohamed Atta. Shaffer's allegations subsequently became known as the Able Danger controversy. According to his later statement to Congress, in October 2003 Shaffer told the 9/11 Commission staff director, Dr. Philip D. Zelikow, that in 2000, a DIA data-mining program known as Able Danger had uncovered two of the three terrorist cells which the FBI determined committed 9/11. Shaffer reportedly told Zelikow that DIA leadership declined to share this information with the FBI because military lawyers expressed concerns about the legality of doing so. Shaffer also asserted that he briefed Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet on three separate occasions regarding his unit's activities. The 9/11 Commission Report did not mention Shaffer's allegations, but in 2005 and 2006, the chairman of the House Select Intelligence Committee, Rep. Curt Weldon, publicized Shaffer's allegations in public statements and hearings. Shaffer alleges that the Pentagon repeatedly prevented Able Danger from telling the FBI that they had identified and located Atta, the 9/11 hijackings leader, residing with three other 9/11 hijackers a year before 9/11 in Brooklyn, NYC, and that George Tenet, the FBI director on 9/11 says that if the FBI had been given that information they could have prevented 9/11. Shaffer says, and his Able Danger colleagues confirm, that the Pentagon forbade them on several occasions from communicating the Able Danger investigation results to the FBI, and that as a result nothing was done regarding the Atta cell. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QI5H3Ctlmsc According to US Congressman Weldon, in a speech delivered to Congress, the Pentagon took the following actions against Lt Col. Shaffer as punishment for his repeatedly bringing forward of the above Able Danger facts: Stripped him of his security clearance, put him on indefinite suspension without pay, took away his pension and medical coverage, and had a judge sign a gag order preventing him from telling the press, congress, etc. about Able Danger's discovery of terrorist Mohamed Atta and his cell in NYC. This communication would have, according to the CIA Director Tenet, prevented 9/11 hijackings from Boston's Logan International Airport and attacks on the World Trade Center in NYC, the Pentagon in Washington D.C., and other planned targets in the U.S.A. on September 11, 2001. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QI5H3Ctlmsc Censored memoirs Shaffer published memoirs of his time as a reports officer in Afghanistan in book titled Operation Dark Heart. Shaffer claims that the Defense Department attempted to preserve secrecy of revelations made by the book, by buying up and destroying all 10,000 copies of the book's first, uncensored run, before allowing for the release of a second, censored printing. Current work Shaffer is a frequent guest in the media. He retired from the U.S. Army Reserve. He serves as member of the U.S. Nuclear Strategy Forum. Shaffer was appointed in the summer of 2013 as a senior fellow to the London Center for Policy Research. With William H.

The building, constructed of wood and lathe-and-plaster on a masonry foundation, was known as the \\"Azeryan Yalƒ±sƒ±\\" (Azarian waterside mansion) and belonged to the wealthy Azarian family, Armenian Catholics from Sivas.http://www.maggieblanck.com/Azarian/Azarian.html The building was purchased by the Ko√ß family in 1950, and was used by them as a summerhouse until the decision to convert it into a museum was taken in 1978. The conversion into a museum was carried out between 1978 and 1980 according to a restoration project that had been prepared by Sedat Hakkƒ± Eldem. It opened its doors to the public on October 14, 1980 with the Sadberk Ko√ß collection on display. The Azeryan Yalƒ± occupies of space set in grounds measuring a total of in all. On the ground floor is a gift shop and a small tea room. The ceiling over the main entrance, which is no longer used, is decorated with plaster moldings inspired by ancient Roman architecture. Wooden stairways lead to the upper floors. The walls are painted so as to resemble veined marble. The centrally located main halls of the second and third floors and the rooms opening onto them are used for display purposes. The attic is used for storage and also contains offices and a library. The crossed wooden moldings decorating the exterior give the building a distinctive appearance quite different from that of its neighbors. It is because of these molded facades that the building was for a long time popularly known as the \\"Threaded Yalƒ±\\". In 1983, the Vehbi Ko√ß Foundation purchased the H√ºseyin Kocaba≈ü collection for the Sadberk Hanƒ±m Museum. It was decided to purchase and restore a semi- dilapidated yalƒ± adjacent to it to house these new acquisitions. The facade of this second yali, which is thought to have been constructed in the early part of this century, was faithfully reconstructed according to the original. The restoration project was prepared by ƒ∞brahim Yal√ßƒ±n and the work, including the construction of the museum, took two years to complete. This museum, which was opened on October 24, 1988, was given the name the \\"Sevgi G√∂n√ºl Wing\\" after the daughter of Sadberk. It houses works from the pre-Islamic period. In 1988 it was awarded the Europa Nostra prize as an outstanding example of modern museum architecture and design. This wing is completely constructed of reinforced concrete. The front is clad in wood while the side is clad in marble stucco treated to resemble wood. This was done as a precaution against fire. The building has three stories in the front and four at the back, including the ground floor on which are located a multi-purpose hall and conservation laboratory. Archaeological objects are displayed in chronological order on the main and other floors. The total exhibition space is . The entrance floor is paved in white Afyon marble while black Adapazarƒ± marble was used for the floors of the exhibition spaces and the stairs. All the exhibition areas are sealed off from daylight and the display cases are illuminated in keeping with modern museum techniques.

() is a Russian rock band from Lyubertsy, a city in Moscow Oblast. Lyube's music is a mixture of several genres, with influences from both Russian folk music, rock, Russian chanson, and Soviet military songs. The band was founded in 1989, and since then have released sixteen albums. Lyube's producer and main songwriter is Igor Matviyenko. History Lyube singer Nikolay Rastorguyev meets Russian president Vladimir Putin, a fan of the band Igor Matviyenko was a music producer and composer working at the Soviet music studio SPM Record when he came up with the idea to start Lyube in 1988. His goal was to put together a band with patriotic themed songs and a strong male vocal. After devoting time to finding the right frontman, Matvienko chose Nikolay Rastorguyev, with whom he had worked earlier in the band \\"Leysia, pesnia\\" (). Rastorguyev came up with the band's name. \\"Lyube\\" has two simultaneous derivations. It is a nickname for the Moscow suburb of Lyubertsy, which is where Rastorguyev lived. It is also a slang word meaning \\"any\\" and signifies a diversity of choices or views. Initially, the band had Aleksandr Nikolayev on bass, Vyacheslav Tereshenok on guitar, Rinat Bakhteev on drums, and Aleksandr Davydov on keyboard, with Rastorguyev as the lead vocalist. Over time, only Rastorguyev remained of the original group. Lyube's first tour took place in 1989, with the band giving concerts in the Russian cities of Pyatigorsk and Zheleznovodsk. These initial concerts were poorly attended. The band's first real break took place in December 1989 when they were invited to perform in a series of concerts sponsored by Alla Pugacheva. Rastorguyev wore an old-style military uniform for the performance. After that, the uniform became a part of the singer's image for many years. =Early 1990s: Debut and Rise to Fame= The band released its first compilation of songs in 1990, titled \\"We will now live a new way\\" (). The same year, the band's membership changed, with Yuriy Ripyakh taking over on drums and Vitaliy Loktev taking over on keyboard. Aleksandr Vaynberg came on board as second guitar. After the release of the compilation, Lyube gained national exposure in Russia, appearing in television programs and being nominated to take place in the prestigious \\"Song of the Year\\" () competition. In 1991, Lyube released its first official LP. The debut album was titled \\"Atas\\" (), and included the title song, along with the songs \\"Pops Makhno\\" (), \\"Taganskaya station\\" (), \\"Don't destroy, you men\\" (), and \\"Lyubertsy\\" (). These songs were already well known to Lyube fans from the band's performances in concert, on the radio, and on television. The recording took place at recording studio \\"Sound\\" () and at a studio of the Moscow Palace of Youth. The album cover featured a photograph of the band members dressed like Red Army soldiers from the days of the Russian Civil War, further building on Rastorguyev's and the band's military styling. The same year, Lyube held a series of concerts at the Moscow sports mega-complex \\"Olympic\\" () where they unveiled a number of new songs, including \\"Stop fooling around, America\\" (), \\"Rabbit fur\\" (), and \\"Have mercy, Lord, upon us sinners and save us...\\" (). Lyube filmed their first music video in 1991 in the Russian city of Sochi, using \\"Stop fooling around, America\\" as the song. The music video incorporated early CGI and animation elements. In 1994, the music video was submitted to the Midem festival in Cannes and received a special jury prize for \\"Comedic and visual quality\\". After its initial success, the band's membership changed again. Evgeniy Nasibulin and Oleg Zenin were added as back-up vocalists. Yuriy Ripyakh was replaced on drums by Aleksandr Erokhin, previously the drummer for the group \\"Gulyai Poleh\\" (). Aleksandr Nikolayev was replaced on bass by Sergey Bashlykov. By this time, the band had built a fan base and developed a large following in Russia. In 1992, Lyube released its second album, titled \\"Who said that we lived badly...?\\" (). The songs for the album were recorded at the Moscow Palace of Youth and Stas Namin's Studio, and the mastering was completed at studio MSM in Munich, Germany. The album included such hits as \\"Come, let's play\\" (), \\"Stop fooling around, America\\", \\"Rabbit fur\\", \\"Tram five\\" (), and \\"Old noble\\" (). Around the release of the second album, Aleksandr Vaynberg and Oleg Zenin left the band in order to start their own group called \\"Nashe Delo\\" (). =Mid-1990s: Pinnacle of Success= Lyube's follow-up to their sophomore effort took two years to complete. The new album was titled \\"Lyube Zone\\" (), which was a play on words as the term \\"zone\\" has a secondary meaning that refers to a camp for convicts. Some songs on the new album featured Russian folk instruments, including the balalaika, the domra, and the bayan. A number of songs were recorded using teams of back-up vocalists led by Anatoliy Kuleshov, who joined the group in 1994. The recording was done at studios at Mosfilm and the mastering was completed by the German company Audiorent. Upon completing the album, the group decided to combine the music videos based on the album's songs into a feature film. Directed by Dmitry Zolotukhin, the film was produced with the participation of studios Kontakt, Mosfilm, and Gorky. Marina Levtova took on the lead role, while secondary roles were played by a number of known film and stage actors. The film's story was based on seven songs from the new album. Levtova played a reporter who travels to a camp for convicts, where she interviews convicts, guards, and orphans from a nearby orphanage. Each person's story becomes one of the group's songs. The group delayed the release of their third album by more than a year while the film was being completed in order to ensure a simultaneous release of the album and the accompanying film. With \\"Lyube Zone\\", the group diversified its musical output, adding softer songs and rock ballads. The album was a critical and commercial success and won the \\"Bronze spinner\\" () award as the best domestic release for 1994. As the album was being completed in 1993, band member Vyacheslav Tereshonok died from a drug overdose and was replaced by Sergey Pereguda who earlier was part of such Russian music groups as \\"Integral\\" () and \\"Veselye Rebyata\\" (). In 1995, Lyube recorded the song \\"Kombat\\" (). The lyrics were written by Aleksandr Shaganov and the music was created by Igor Matvienko. The song has a military feel to it and chronicles episodes from World War II. The first live performance of Kombat took place in Moscow at a concert celebrating the 50 years anniversary of the Allied victory over Nazi Germany. Kombat became the title song and the first single for the group's next album and was recognized as the \\"best song of 1995\\" in Russia. The album Kombat was released in 1996 and, in addition to the title song, contained the songs \\"Moscow streets\\" (), \\"Demobilization soon\\" (), \\"AWOL\\" (), and \\"There served two friends\\" (), all of which featured war- related themes. Fittingly, the album cover depicted a red star atop a military uniform. Most of the songs included on Kombat combined elements of Russian folk music with modern rock, which became a distinctive feature of Lyube's sound. In May 1996, Lyube played a live television concert as part of unveiling Kombat. Given the military action taking place in Chechnya and the Caucasus in 1996, the war themes of Kombat resonated with Russian audiences. The title song topped the charts and the album received the award for \\"best album of 1996\\". That same year, Rastorguyev fulfilled a long time dream by recording and producing an album of Beatles songs that was titled \\"Four nights in Moscow\\" (). By the end of 1996, Lyube was at the height of its popularity despite losing Aleksandr Nikolayev, their long-time bass player, to an auto accident. He was replaced by Pavel Usanov. =Late 1990s: Retrospectives, Covers, and Soundtracks= In 1997, Rastorguyev became a \\"Recognized Artist of the Russian Federation\\" (), the second-highest honor for a singer in Russia, awarded by the country's President. In the spring of that year, Lyube released a greatest hits album called \\"Collected works 1989-1997\\" (). In addition to the band's hits, the album also had the new song \\"Guys from our neighborhood\\" (). At the end of 1997, Lyube released its new album, called \\"Songs about people\\" (). In addition to \\"Guys from our neighborhood\\", the most popular songs on the new album were \\"There, past the mists\\" (), \\"Years\\" (), and \\"Starlings\\" (). The new album featured more lyrical, slower tempo songs that spoke to human relationships and nostalgia for days gone by. In early 1998, Lyube took part in a concert celebrating the famous Russian singer Vladimir Vysotsky, where they covered two of Vysotsky's hits: \\"On soldiers' mass graves\\" () and \\"Song about stars\\" (). Rastorguyev also lent his vocal talent to recording the song \\"Borders\\" () from the film \\"Hot spot\\" () and the song \\"There is only the moment\\" () from the film \\"The Sannikov Land\\" () for inclusion in the third collection of the series \\"Old songs about what matters\\" (). Lyube also recorded a number of songs for the soundtracks of the films \\"On a lively place\\" () and \\"Harness\\" (). In 1999, Lyube celebrated its 10-year anniversary with a Ukraine tour titled \\"Lyube - 10 years!\\" (). That year, the group released a new song titled \\"Whistle-stops\\" (), which would appear on the group's next album. =2000s to the Present= In May 2000, Lyube released their new album and held a major concert at the Sports Complex Olympic in Moscow showcasing both old and new songs and celebrating the band's 10-year anniversary. In addition to \\"Substations\\", the new album featured the hit \\"Soldier\\" (), for which Lyube won a Russian Grammy, and also the hit \\"We'll Bust Through\\" (), which became the theme song to the Russian television series \\"Deadly Force\\" (). In 2001, Lyube played a live concert on Victory Day in Red Square. That same year, Russian president Vladimir Putin, an avowed fan of the band, appointed Rastorguyev to the position of Cultural Advisor to the Russian government. British producers of the documentary film \\"Russian Army\\" bought rights from Lyube to use their songs \\"Demobilization soon\\" and \\"Kombat\\" in the film. Toward the end of the year, Lyube released \\"Collected works. Volume 2\\" () that included old hits that did not make it into the original \\"Collected works\\", along with the new recordings \\"You carry me, river\\" () and \\"Song about stars\\". In March 2002, Lyube released a new album, titled \\"Let's drink it for...\\" (). The album followed a retro style reflecting the sound of Russian \\"VIA\\" bands of the 1960s and 1970s. The band used vintage instruments during recording to approximate the sound of the sixties and seventies as close as possible. Songs on the album included \\"Birches\\" (), \\"Haymaking\\" (), \\"You carry me, river\\" (), \\"Two girlfriends\\" (), \\"Singing guitar\\" (), \\"It was, it was\\" (), and \\"Grandma\\" (). The album stayed near the top of the charts throughout 2002 and subsequently received the \\"Album of the Year\\" award from the Russian music recording industry in 2003. In the same period, Rastorguyev was elevated to \\"National Artist of the Russian Federation\\" and band members Anatoliy Kuleshov, Vitaliy Loktev, and Aleksandr Erokhin were all awarded the title \\"Recognized Artist of the Russian Federation\\". In 2004, Lyube celebrated their 15-year anniversary by releasing a two-album set. The first album, titled \\"Guys from our regiment\\" (), was released in 2004 and featured the band's earlier hits and new recordings dealing with war-time themes. The second album, titled \\"Rasseya\\" (), featured all new songs, including the title hit \\"Rasseya\\" and the song \\"Don't watch the clock\\" (). The album also included a special version of \\"Through the tall grass\\" (), recorded together with members of the Russian special forces from the spetsnaz Alfa group and a rock rendition of the Hymn of the Russian Federation. From its title to its cover art to its song selection, Rasseya featured patriotic themes. Toward the end of 2006, Lyube released a new single called \\"Moscow girls\\" () and began work on a new album, which would take them two years. In 2008, while still working on the new album, the band released \\"Collected works. Volume 3\\" that included songs from the albums \\"Atas\\", \\"Who said that we lived badly...?\\", \\"Lyube Zone\\", \\"Kombat\\", \\"Songs about people\\", \\"Let's do it for...\\", and \\"Rasseya\\". It also featured two new songs: \\"A hunter's hut\\" () and \\"My Admiral\\" (), recorded for the soundtrack of the Russian film \\"Admiral\\". In 2009, Lyube released the new album they had been working on for the previous two years, titled \\"Our people\\" (). The album featured both previously released hits, such as \\"A hunter's hut\\", \\"If...\\" (), \\"My Admiral\\", \\"Moscow girls\\", and new songs, such as \\"Verka\\" (), \\"And sunrise\\" (), \\"Calendar\\" (), and the title song, \\"Our people\\". The new album moved away from war-time and patriotic themes, focusing more on love and relationships. It also featured duets with such popular Russian singers as Grigory Leps, Nikita Mihalkov, and Victoria Dayneko. That same year, Lyube celebrated their 20-year anniversary with a series of live concerts at the Kremlin and an international tour. At present, the band has five members, still led by Rastorguyev. Lyube has only produced one original song in English, called No More Barricades, which addresses the topic of democracy in Russia.

Its efforts to promote the rights of Muslim women are based on the principles of equality, justice and freedom enjoined by the Quran. SIS work focuses on challenging laws and policies made in the name of Islam that discriminate against women. As such it tackles issues covered under Malaysia's Islamic family and sharia laws, such as polygamy, child marriage, moral policing, Islamic legal theory and jurisprudence, the hijab and modesty, violence against women and hudud. Today, SIS areas of work have expanded to encompass larger issues of democracy, human rights and constitutionalism, as well as urging the observance of human rights principles and international treaties and conventions signed by the Malaysian Government. SIS then began to take public positions of critical importance in the face of attempts to prosecute Muslims attempting to leave Islam, and efforts to silence differing opinions in Islam. Underlying these activities was the firm belief that, as a concerned group working towards a better society, SIS could not isolate itself from the larger human rights and democratic movements in the country. A movement for gender justice must necessarily be a part of the larger human rights movement, and vice versa. The protection and expansion of the democratic space enabling a civil society to thrive \\"and upholding the fundamental liberties of the Malaysian Constitution\\" are the responsibilities of all citizens, for it is precisely these liberties that have enabled groups like SIS to exist. Through the expertise of mufassirah (an expert in tafsir, 'interpretation') Amina Wadud, the group engaged actively in a model of Qur'anic hermeneutics that examined the socio-historical context of Revelation as a whole, and that of particular Qur'anic verses. The group examined the language of the Text and its syntactical and grammatical structure, and it looked at the Text as a whole to understand its worldview. This combined methodology allowed an exciting interface to emerge between theology and interpretation on one hand, and daily realities of Muslim women within the contemporary socio-legal context on the other. Empowered by their knowledge, the women were compelled their findings with the public in an effort to break the dominant belief that Islam discriminated against women. Their mission is to promote the principles of gender equality, justice, freedom, and dignity of Islam and empower women to be advocates for change. They seek to promote a framework of women's rights in Islam which take into consideration women's experiences and realities; they want to eliminate the injustice and discrimination that women may face by changing the mindsets that may hold women to be inferior to men; and they want to increase the public knowledge and reform laws and policies within the framework of justice and equality in Islam. The Sisters in Islam leaders hold the following: \\"We uphold the revolutionary spirit of Islam, a religion which uplifted the status of women when it was revealed 1400 years ago. We believe that Islam does not endorse the oppression of women and denial of their basic rights of equality and human dignity. We are deeply saddened that religion has been used to justify cultural practices and values that regard women as inferior and subordinate to men and we believe that this has been made possible because men have had exclusive control over the interpretation of the text of the Qur‚Äôan.\\" History Zainah Anwar \\"If God is just as Islam is just, why do laws and policies made in the name of Islam create injustice?\\" This was the burning question faced by the founding members of Sisters in Islam (SIS) when they began their search for solutions to the problem of discrimination against Muslim women in the name of Islam. SIS was formed in 1988 and registered as a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) in 1993 under the name SIS Forum Malaysia. The name Sisters in Islam is retained as an authorship name. Sisters in Islam was co-founded by seven women: Zainah Anwar, Amina Wadud, Askiah Adam, Norani Othman, Rashidah Abdullah, Rose Ismail and Sharifah Zuriah Aljeffri. Criticism SIS has drawn criticism from conservative Muslim state and non-state actors because of its views. Its position, for example, in promoting monogamy as a Quranic ideal, was challenged by the Department of Islamic Development (JAKIM). The group has also drawn the ire of the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) for criticising PAS' Kelantan Syariah Criminal Bill (H) 1993 on the basis that it discriminated against Malaysian women and imposed the death penalty for apostasy. PAS, in 2009, called for SIS to be investigated and for its members to be \\"rehabilitated\\". In 2010, Malaysian Assembly of Mosque Youth (MAMY) brought a lawsuit against Sisters in Islam, alleging the misuse of the word \\"Islam\\" in the organization's name. The High Court, however, struck out the application. Other right wing groups have alleged that Sisters in Islam misinterprets religious principles in response to SIS' efforts to stop authorities from caning a woman who was sentenced by the Syariah court for drinking beer in public.article in The Jakarta Post 22 March 2010 In 2014, the Selangor Islamic Religious Council (MAIS) issued a fatwa declaring that Sisters In Islam, as well as any other organisation promoting religious liberalism and pluralism, deviate from the teachings of Islam. According to the edict, publications that are deemed to promote liberal and pluralistic religious thinking are to be declared unlawful and confiscated, while social media is also to be monitored and restricted. As fatwas are legally binding in Malaysia, SIS is challenging it on constitutional grounds.http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2014/10/31/Sisters-in-Islam- files-for-judicial-review-on-fatwa/  See also  * Aurat (Malay language) * Feminism in Malaysia * Islamic feminism * Gerwani * Hermenautics of feminism in Islam * Musawah * Women in Malaysia * Zainah Anwar NotesReferences * Ong, Aihwa and Peletz, Michael G.

The company's historic plant is located in Peru, Illinois. Early history as United Clock Company Charles Stahlberg and others from Waterbury, Connecticut, formed the \\"United Clock Company\\" on December 5, 1885, in Peru, Illinois, intending to manufacture clocks based on a technological innovation by Stahlberg. Stahlberg patented this innovation on September 22, 1885, (US patent #326,602) which involved the use of molded lead alloy movement plates with inset brass bushings as well as lead alloy gear assemblies. Shortly after receiving the 1885 patent, United Clock Company went bankrupt, and there are no known surviving examples of the patented clock. The main entrance Westclox building in Peru, Illinois Bankruptcies, reorganizations, and mergers In 1887, the company reorganized under the new name Western Clock Company and again went bankrupt, and F. W. Matthiessen reorganized it in 1888 as the Western Clock Manufacturing Company. In 1908, the company received a patent for the \\"Big Ben\\" alarm clock movement. This movement has a \\"bell-back\\" design, meaning that the bell mechanism is integral to the clock's case. The company first brought the Big Ben to market in 1909. The company's name was shortened to \\"Western Clock Company\\" in 1912. In 1910, the Big Ben became the first alarm clock advertised nationally, with ads placed in the Saturday Evening Post. The modern trademark of the company, \\"Westclox,\\" first appeared on the back of Big Ben alarm clocks from 1910 to 1917. The name appeared on Big Ben dials as early as 1911. The company officially registered this trademark on January 18, 1916. In 1919, Western Clock Co., Ltd., was incorporated. Twelve years later, in 1931, the company merged with Seth Thomas Clock Company, with both companies becoming divisions of General Time Corporation. The Westclox unit became known as \\"Westclox Division of General Time Corporation\\" in 1936. A Westclox seventeen-jewel pocketwatch. In 1938, Westclox introduced its first portable travel alarm clock to the market. World War II wartime efforts During World War II, Westclox and other General Time Corporation subsidiaries produced aviation instrumentation and control components, compasses for the United States Army, and clocks for the United States Navy. From 1942 to 1945, Westclox ceased all production intended for domestic civilian sale and dedicated its production resources to the war effort. Westclox became a major manufacturer of fuzes for military ordnance. Watches The Westclox company was a major manufacturer of dollar watches. It started production of an inexpensive, back-winding pocket watch in 1899, which was intended to be affordable to any working person. The company continued to produce cheap pocket watches into the 1990s. Late 20th-century developments In 1959, Westclox introduced and patented its \\"drowse\\" alarm, which was one of the first of its kind powered by electricity, which integrated what is now more commonly known as a \\"snooze\\" function. Talley Industries acquired General Time in 1968. Westclox introduced its first quartz movement in 1972. In 1988, the management of Talley Industries purchased General Time from the company. Another bankruptcy shortly followed, and Salton, Inc. acquired the \\"Westclox\\" and \\"Big Ben\\" trademarks in 2001. Modern Westclox wall clock In October 2007, Salton sold its entire time products business, including the Westclox and Ingraham trademarks, to NYL Holdings LLC. 2012 New Year's Fire Remains of the factory after the fire In the early morning of January 1, 2012, a fire broke out at the Westclox premises in Peru, IL. The fire destroyed about 25% of the structure. Two teens were charged with aggravated arson; Steven M. Gallacher (then 17) of LaSalle, IL, and an unidentified minor (then 16). The fire required firefighters and police from 20 surrounding municipalities to extinguish. One firefighter, LaSalle fireman Steve Smith, sustained a career-ending injury when a firehose attached to a hydrant popped loose and the metal coupling on the end hit him in the leg. Gallacher was convicted of aggravated arson on October 11, 2012, with a sentence of 6-30 years without the possibility of parole. Gallacher's sentence of aggravated arson was the direct result of the fire plus Smith's injury. Trivia A 1950‚Äôs produced Westclox Big Ben loud alarm is featured in the movie Rocky. The alarm clock is set at 4:02am, when Rocky Balboa starts his training routine with consuming raw eggs in a glass and running in the streets of Philadelphia. The clock can also be seen later in the film (set at 2:27am) in another scene in which Rocky tells Adrian that he wants to prove that he‚Äôs not just another bum from the neighborhood.

It debuted on September 18, 1993 as part of the Saturday morning line-up for fall 1993 on ABC. Cro lasted 1¬Ω seasons and ran in reruns through summer 1995. The show had an educational theme (this was before federal educational/informational mandates took effect in 1996), introducing basic concepts of physics, mechanical engineering, and technology. The premise of using woolly mammoths as a teaching tool for the principles of technology was inspired by David Macaulay's The Way Things Work; Macaulay is credited as writer on the show. The last new episode aired on October 22, 1994. The show was released on video (VHS) in a total of nine volumes. Premise A scientist named Dr. C and her assistant Mike travel to the Arctic to study artifacts and find a frozen woolly mammoth named Phil. They thaw him out and are surprised to find that he can speak. Whenever a situation in modern times involves physics principles, Phil remembers when a similar event occurred long ago in the prehistoric valley of Woollyville with his fellow mammoths and his Cro-Magnon friend Cro, who lived with a family of Neanderthals. Each episode features Phil narrating how a problem was resolved through simple engineering. The show's (and lead character's) name is an Occitan word for \\"cave\\"; it alludes to Cro-Magnon, the location in France where the earliest anatomically modern humans were first discovered. CharactersCavepeople= * Cro (voiced by Max Casella) ‚Äì A fully evolved, 11-year-old Cro-Magnon boy who was adopted by a tribe of Neanderthals. He was a somewhat scrawny and yet still rather muscular young Cro-Magnon boy with long, shaggy, red hair and wore a yellow armband on one arm. Most of the Neanderthals that he lives with are jealous of his intelligence. Unlike the rest of the tribe, Cro speaks in complete sentences. * Ogg (voiced by Jim Cummings) ‚Äì The selfish, bossy leader of Cro's adoptive Neanderthal tribe. He is difficult to get along with but easily frightened by danger. * Gogg (voiced by Frank Welker) ‚Äì A sensitive Neanderthal who sticks up for Bobb and mostly translates for him, even though Nandy and Ogg do occasionally. * Bobb (voiced by Frank Welker) ‚Äì Another adopted member of the Neanderthal tribe and the least evolved of the tribe, resembling a homo habilis. He does not speak like the rest of the Neanderthals, but makes ape- like noises which Gogg usually translates. When Bobb was younger, he was in a different tribe made up of similar homo habilis. The tribe took a nap and Bobb woke up to find the whole tribe had vanished without a trace, creating a fear of loneliness until the Neanderthals found him. * Nandy (voiced by Ruth Buzzi) ‚Äì The matriarch of the Neanderthal tribe who is noted for her urban legends. Some of her legends include the legend of \\"Big Thing\\" and a monster called \\"Big Skinny Thing with Many, Many Legs.\\" She gets into arguments with Ogg and usually wins as she is fully aware of Ogg's own fears. Nandy is very overprotective of Cro and motherly around everyone else. =Woolly Mammoths= * Phil (voiced by Jim Cummings) ‚Äì A smart but goofy woolly mammoth with orange and reddish fur who is kind to humans and mammoths alike. During the end of the Ice Age, Phil fell into a glacier while saving Cro from Selene and was thawed out by Mike and Dr. C 45,000 years later. He narrates stories of his life in Woollyville in every episode. * Ivanna (voiced by Laurie O'Brien) ‚Äì Ivanna is a southern belle woolly mammoth with yellow fur and brown skin with a mole who is Phil's love interest. She is the second oldest female mammoth in Phil's herd next to Esmeralda. She usually uses Phil for her experiments. * Pakka (voiced by Candi Milo) ‚Äì A young woolly mammoth with light orange fur and yellow skin and a close friend of Cro's. She and Cro meet after Cro confronts Selene the Smilodon. She is the third oldest female mammoth next to Ivanna and Esmeralda. She sometimes tells Cro interesting facts about mammoths. * Steamer (voiced by Charlie Adler) ‚Äì The youngest woolly mammoth in Phil's herd with maroon fur and light purple skin, whose hyperactivity and love of making mischief often land him in hot water. * Esmeralda (voiced by Tress MacNeille) ‚Äì The oldest female woolly mammoth and matriarch of Phil's herd with light yellow fur and gray skin. She makes sure that everything goes to order and that those who have wronged the mammoth society be punished. She has strongly mixed feelings about the presence of Cro's tribe in Woollyville. * Earle (voiced by Frank Welker) ‚Äì An elderly woolly mammoth with gray fur with dark gray-blue skin and a bald spot due to not having longer fur on his head. He hates humans and prefer traditions over new ways of life. * Mojo (voiced by Charlie Adler) ‚Äì A woolly mammoth who is Earle's younger brother with gray fur and light gray skin. Like Earle, Mojo hates humans and prefer traditions over new ways of life. =Villains= * Big Red (voiced by Charlie Adler) ‚Äì The conniving leader of a menacing pack of bumbling dire wolves. He uses threats to scare his minions into doing a good job. The wolves are one of two antagonists on the show as they would often try to eat Cro's tribe or the younger woolly mammoths. ** Murray (voiced by Jim Cummings) ‚Äì The minions of Big Red. Because he threatens them, the dire wolves fear him. Murray thinks stupid things, which Big Red doesn't like, as shown in Things That Eat Mung in the Night. * Selene (voiced by Jane Singer) ‚Äì A seductive, purple, yellow-eyed Smilodon. She first appears in \\"Lever in a Million Years\\" and has a monstrous appetite for anything that moves, including the cavepeople. According to the show's opening theme song, she and Phil were fighting on a cliff and fell when part of the cliff gave way. She landed on a lower cliff, while Phil fell into a glacier and was frozen in suspended animation for thousands of years. =Other characters= * Dr. Cecilia (voiced by April Ortiz) ‚Äì A female scientist in modern times. She and Mike thawed out Phil, so he tells them his stories. Dr. C speaks with a distinct Hispanic accent and speaks a few Spanish words in some episodes. She bears a resemblance to Cro and may in fact be his descendant. * Mike (voiced by Jussie Smollett) ‚Äì A young friend of Dr. C. who wears big glasses. He likes to play basketball and lives with Dr. C for reasons not specified. He and Dr. C were the two people that thawed out Phil and therefore, he tells them his stories. * Teddie (voiced by Bill Daber) ‚Äì Teddy is a friend of Cro's. He is only featured in one episode (with the Talent Show), but is important nonetheless. He invented the first ever Rap music! * Sooli (voiced by Cree Summer) ‚Äì Sooli is another Cro-Magnon who got separated from her tribe and Cro and Pakka help her find her favorite horse. Sooli only appeared in one episode.

This chemical reaction was described in 1828 by Friedrich W√∂hler.Friedrich W√∂hler (1828). \\"Ueber k√ºnstliche Bildung des Harnstoffs\\". Annalen der Physik und Chemie. 88 (2): 253‚Äì256 It is often cited as the starting point of modern organic chemistry. Although the W√∂hler reaction concerns the conversion of ammonium cyanate, this salt appears only as an (unstable) intermediate. W√∂hler demonstrated the reaction in his original publication with different sets of reactants: a combination of cyanic acid and ammonia, a combination of silver cyanate and ammonium chloride, a combination of lead cyanate and ammonia and finally from a combination of mercury cyanate and cyanatic ammonia (which is again cyanic acid with ammonia). Modified versions of the W√∂hler synthesis The reaction can be demonstrated by starting with solutions of potassium cyanate and ammonium chloride which are mixed, heated and cooled again. An additional proof of the chemical transformation is obtained by adding a solution of oxalic acid which forms urea oxalate as a white precipitate. Alternatively the reaction can be carried out with lead cyanate and ammonia. The actual reaction taking place is a double displacement reaction to form ammonium cyanate: :{Pb(OCN)2} + {2NH3} + 2H2O -> {Pb(OH)2} + {2NH4(OCN)} Ammonium cyanate decomposes to ammonia and cyanic acid which in turn react to produce urea: :{NH4(OCN)} -> {NH3} + HOCN <=> {(NH2)2CO} Complexation with oxalic acid drives this chemical equilibrium to completion. =Debate= It is disputed that W√∂hler's synthesis sparked the downfall of the theory of vitalism, which states that organic matter possessed a certain vital force common to all living things. Prior to the W√∂hler synthesis, the work of John Dalton and J√∂ns Jacob Berzelius had already convinced chemists that organic and inorganic matter obey the same chemical laws. It took until 1845 when Kolbe reported another inorganic ‚Äì organic conversion (of carbon disulfide to acetic acid) before vitalism started to lose support.Ramberg, Peter, \\"Myth 7.

Some authorities consider this to be a subfamily of the Myliobatidae (eagle rays). Their appearance is similar to that of manta rays, which are in the same family, and based on genetic and morphological evidence, the mantas belong in Mobula (they are traditionally in their own genus Manta). Species of this genus are often collectively referred to as \\"devil rays\\", \\"flying mobula\\", or simply \\"flying rays\\", due to their propensity for breaching, sometimes in a spectacular manner. Depending on the exact species, the devil rays can attain widths up to , the largest being second only to the manta rays in size, which can reach . Despite their size, little is known about the devil rays, much of it being from anecdotal accounts, whereas the manta rays are better known. Most species entirely lack a tail stinger. In most species having a stinger, it is encased, rendering it harmless; only M. mobular has a \\"free\\" stinger.

Taxonomy The timber rattlesnake was one of the many reptile species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in the landmark 1758 10th edition of his Systema Naturae, and still bears its original name Crotalus horridus. The subspecies C. h. atricaudatus (Latreille in Sonnini and Latreille, 1802), often referred to as the canebrake rattlesnake, is currently considered invalid. Previously, it was recognized by Gloyd (1936) and Klauber (1936). Based on an analysis of geographic variation, Pisani et al. (1972) concluded no subspecies should be recognized. This was rejected by Conant (1975), but followed by Collins and Knight (1980). Brown and Ernst (1986) found evidence for retaining the two subspecies, but state it is not possible to tell them apart without having more information than usual, including adult size, color pattern, the number of dorsal scale rows and the number of ventral scales. Dundee and Rossman (1989) recognized C. h. atricaudatus, but others take a more neutral point of view. Description Adults usually grow to total length of .

The dorsal scales are keeled (Crotalus horridus, pp. 688-689 + Plates 619, 620, 653.) and arranged in 21‚Äì26 scale rows at midbody (usually 25 rows in the southern part of its geographic range, and 23 rows in the northern part). The ventral scales number 158‚Äì177 in males and 163‚Äì183 in females. Males have 20‚Äì30 subcaudal scales, while females have 15‚Äì26. The rostral scale is normally a little higher than it is wide. In the internasal-prefrontal area there are 4‚Äì22 scales that include 2 large, triangular internasal scales that border the rostral, followed by 2 large, quadrangular prefrontal scales (anterior canthals) that may contact each other along the midline, or may be separated by many small scales. Between the supraocular and internasal, only a single canthal scale is present. There are 5‚Äì7 intersupraocular scales. The number of prefoveal scales varies between 2 and 8. Usually the first supralabial scale is in broad contact with the prenasal scale, although slightly to moderately separated along its posteroventral margin by the most anterior prefoveals. Dorsally, they have a pattern of dark brown or black crossbands on a yellowish brown or grayish background. The crossbands have irregular zig-zag edges, and may be V-shaped or M-shaped. Often a rust-colored vertebral stripe is present. Ventrally they are yellowish, uniform or marked with black.Boulenger GA (1896).

Distribution and habitat Timber rattlesnakes are present in the eastern United States from southern Minnesota and southern New Hampshire, south to east Texas and north Florida.Conant R, Collins JT (1998). Reptiles and Amphibians of Eastern/Central North America. New York: Houghton Mifflin. One hundred and fifteen rattlesnakes have been marked within Brown County State Park in Indiana, one of the only places where they can be found in the state. Its historic range includes southern Ontario and southern Quebec in Canada, but in May 2001, the Canadian Species at Risk Act listed it as extirpated in Canada.Crotalus horridus at Species at Risk Public Registry. Accessed 23 June 2008. A Canadian government sponsored recovery strategy is currently under study to support the reintroducing of this predator of many pests to its former Canadian habitat. Although several experts disagree, many were present in some of the thick forest areas of central and southeastern Iowa, mostly within the Mississippi, Skunk, Iowa, and Des Moines River valleys, in several places in these areas; bites from timber rattlesnakes have been widespread, especially in a localized area of Geode State Park, in southeastern Henry County, along Credit Island Park, in southern Scott County, and in the forested areas of southern Clinton County. The museum at Amana Colony, Iowa asserts that one founding family lost their firstborn, a daughter at the age of three, due to a rattlesnake bite she received while playing on a woodpile in the 19th century. In Pennsylvania, it is not present west of Chestnut Ridge, which is in the Laurel Highlands, nor is it present in the southeastern corner of the state. Thus, its range does not include the areas of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, the two largest cities in Pennsylvania. C. horridus is extirpated in Maine and Rhode Island and is almost extirpated in New Hampshire. In Massachusetts, the snakes are active from mid-May to mid-October. Early settlers were afraid of the snake, as its population was widespread throughout the state. Since that time their habitat has been reduced to the Blue Hills south of Boston, The Berkshires in Western Massachusetts as well as parts of the Connecticut River Valley, notably in the area of the Holyoke Range. The snake is so rare in the state that it is rarely encountered by people and is considered endangered, making it illegal to harass, kill, collect, or possess. Generally, this species is found in deciduous forests in rugged terrain. During the summer, gravid (pregnant) females seem to prefer open, rocky ledges where the temperatures are higher, while males and nongravid females tend to spend more time in cooler, denser woodland with more closed forest canopy.Timber Rattlesnake Fact Sheet at NY State Dept. of Environmental Conservation. Accessed 8 February 2007. Behavior Female timber rattlers often bask in the sun before giving birth, in open rocky areas known as \\"basking knolls\\". During the winter, timber rattlesnakes brumate in dens, in limestone crevices, often together with copperheads and black rat snakes. =Feeding= Their prey are mainly small mammals, but may include small birds, frogs, other small animals, including other snakes. Although capable of consuming other rattlesnakes, the most common snake they prey upon are garter snakes. Like most rattlesnakes, timber rattlesnakes are known to utilize chemical cues to find sites to ambush their prey and will often strike their prey and track them until they can be consumed.Clark RW (2004). \\"Timber rattlesnakes (Crotalus horridus) use chemical cues to select ambush sites\\".

Timber rattlesnakes are known to use fallen logs as a waiting site for prey to pass by, giving them an elevated perch from which to effectively strike their prey, which is almost entirely terrestrial rather than arboreal (even arboreal prey such as squirrels tends to be caught when they come to the ground).Platt SG, Hawkes AW, Rainwater TR (2001). \\"Diet of the canebrake rattlesnake (Crotalus horridus atricaudatus): An additional record and review\\". Texas Journal of Science 53 (2): 115-120. The primary foods by genera of timber rattlesnakes were as follows: Peromyscus (33.3%), Microtus (10.9%), Tamias (qv) (10.6%), Sylvilagus (10.4%), Sigmodon (5.3%) and Sciurus (4.2%). Based on examination of the snout-to-vent length, it was found that juvenile timber rattlesnakes differed slightly in dietary preferences from adult rattlesnakes, being more likely to consume smaller prey such as shrews (averaging and unable to attack subadult eastern cottontail rabbits (averaging but Peromyscus was the number one prey item for both young and adult rattlesnakes.

Before striking, they often perform a good deal of preliminary rattling and feinting.US Navy (1991). Poisonous Snakes of the World. New York: US Government / Dover Publications Inc. 203 pp. . Cist (1845) described how he lived in western Pennsylvania for many years, and the species was quite common there, but in all that time, he heard of only a single death resulting from its bite. Considerable geographic and ontogenetic variation occurs regarding the toxicity of the venom, which can be said for many rattlesnake species. Four venom patterns have been described for this species: Type A is largely neurotoxic, and is found in various parts of the southern range. One effect of the toxin can be generalized myokymia. Type B is hemorrhagic and proteolytic, and is found consistently in the north and in parts of the southeast. Type A + B is found in areas where the aforementioned types apparently intergrade in southwestern Arkansas and northern Louisiana. Type C venom has none of the above components and is relatively weak. The neurotoxic component of the type A venom is referred to as canebrake toxin, and is a phospholipase A2. It is analogous to the neurotoxins found in the venoms of several other rattlesnake species, and when present, contributes significantly to the overall toxicity. Other components found in the venom include a small basic peptide that works as a myotoxin, a fibrinogen-clotting enzyme that can produce defibrination syndrome, and a bradykinin-releasing enzyme. CroFab antivenom, while not specific for C. horridus, is used to treat envenomations from this species. Symbol The timber rattlesnake was designated the state reptile of West Virginia in 2008. That state's legislature praised \\"...a proud contribution by the eighth grade class at Romney Middle School, from West Virginia's oldest county, in West Virginia's oldest town, to have been instrumental in making the timber rattlesnake the state reptile...\\" This snake became a prominent symbol of American anger and resolve during the American Revolution due to its fearsome reputation. In the 18th century, European-trained doctors and scientists had little firsthand experience with or information on timber rattlesnakes,Bryson, Bill (2004). A Short History of Nearly Everything. New York: Broadway Books. p. 81. and treatment of their bites was poorly effective. The motto Nemo me impune lacesset (with the verb in the future tense) appears above a Crotalus horridus on a 1778 $20 bill from Georgia as an early example of the colonial use of the coiled rattlesnake symbol, which later became famous on the Gadsden flag. Conservation status This species is classified as least concern on the IUCN Red List (assessed in 2007). Species are listed as such due to their wide distribution, presumed large population, or because they are unlikely to be declining fast enough to qualify for listing in a more threatened category. The timber rattlesnake is listed as endangered in New Jersey, Vermont, Massachusetts (along with the copperhead viper), Virginia, New Hampshire, Indiana, and Ohio, and it is threatened in New York, Connecticut, Illinois, Minnesota, and Texas. Timber rattlesnakes have already been extirpated in Maine and Rhode Island and only one population remains in New Hampshire. They are protected in many of the Appalachian states but their populations continue to decline.

It is related to the semidirect product construction for groups. (Roughly speaking, crossed product is the expected structure for a group ring of a semidirect product group. Therefore crossed products have a ring theory aspect also. This article concentrates on an important case, where they appear in functional analysis.) Motivation Recall that if we have two finite groups G and N with an action of G on N we can form the semidirect product N \\\\rtimes G. This contains N as a normal subgroup, and the action of G on N is given by conjugation in the semidirect product. We can replace N by its complex group algebra C[N], and again form a product C[N] \\\\rtimes G in a similar way; this algebra is a sum of subspaces gC[N] as g runs through the elements of G, and is the group algebra of N \\\\rtimes G. We can generalize this construction further by replacing C[N] by any algebra A acted on by G to get a crossed product A \\\\rtimes G, which is the sum of subspaces gA and where the action of G on A is given by conjugation in the crossed product. The crossed product of a von Neumann algebra by a group G acting on it is similar except that we have to be more careful about topologies, and need to construct a Hilbert space acted on by the crossed product. (Note that the von Neumann algebra crossed product is usually larger than the algebraic crossed product discussed above; in fact it is some sort of completion of the algebraic crossed product.) In physics, this structure appears in presence of the so called gauge group of the first kind. G is the gauge group, and N the \\"field\\" algebra. The observables are then defined as the fixed points of N under the action of G. A result by Doplicher, Haag and Roberts says that under some assumptions the crossed product can be recovered from the algebra of observables. Construction Suppose that A is a von Neumann algebra of operators acting on a Hilbert space H and G is a discrete group acting on A. We let K be the Hilbert space of all square summable H-valued functions on G. There is an action of A on K given by *a(k)(g) = g‚àí1(a)k(g) for k in K, g, h in G, and a in A, and there is an action of G on K given by *g(k)(h) = k(g‚àí1h). The crossed product A \\\\rtimes G is the von Neumann algebra acting on K generated by the actions of A and G on K. It does not depend (up to isomorphism) on the choice of the Hilbert space H. This construction can be extended to work for any locally compact group G acting on any von Neumann algebra A. When A is an abelian von Neumann algebra, this is the original group-measure space construction of Murray and von Neumann. Properties We let G be an infinite countable discrete group acting on the abelian von Neumann algebra A. The action is called free if A has no non-zero projections p such that some nontrivial g fixes all elements of pAp. The action is called ergodic if the only invariant projections are 0 and 1. Usually A can be identified as the abelian von Neumann algebra L^\\\\infty(X) of essentially bounded functions on a measure space X acted on by G, and then the action of G on X is ergodic (for any measurable invariant subset, either the subset or its complement has measure 0) if and only if the action of G on A is ergodic. If the action of G on A is free and ergodic then the crossed product A \\\\rtimes G is a factor. Moreover: * The factor is of type I if A has a minimal projection such that 1 is the sum of the G conjugates of this projection. This corresponds to the action of G on X being transitive. Example: X is the integers, and G is the group of integers acting by translations. *The factor has type II1 if A has a faithful finite normal G-invariant trace. This corresponds to X having a finite G invariant measure, absolutely continuous with respect to the measure on X. Example: X is the unit circle in the complex plane, and G is the group of all roots of unity. *The factor has type II‚àû if it is not of types I or II1 and has a faithful semifinite normal G-invariant trace. This corresponds to X having an infinite G invariant measure without atoms, absolutely continuous with respect to the measure on X. Example: X is the real line, and G is the group of rationals acting by translations. *The factor has type III if A has no faithful semifinite normal G-invariant trace. This corresponds to X having no non-zero absolutely continuous G-invariant measure. Example: X is the real line, and G is the group of all transformations ax+b for a and b rational, a non-zero. In particular one can construct examples of all the different types of factors as crossed products. Duality If A is a von Neumann algebra on which a locally compact Abelian G acts, then \\\\Gamma, the dual group of characters \\\\chi of G, acts by unitaries on K : * (\\\\chi\\\\cdot k)(h) =\\\\chi(h) k(h) These unitaries normalise the crossed product, defining the dual action of \\\\Gamma. Together with the crossed product, they generate A\\\\otimes B(L^2(G)), which can be identified with the iterated crossed product by the dual action (A\\\\rtimes G) \\\\rtimes \\\\Gamma . Under this identification, the double dual action of G (the dual group of \\\\Gamma) corresponds to the tensor product of the original action on A and conjugation by the following unitaries on L^2(G) : * (g\\\\cdot f)(h)=f(hg) The crossed product may be identified with the fixed point algebra of the double dual action. More generally A is the fixed point algebra of \\\\Gamma in the crossed product. Similar statements hold when G is replaced by a non-Abelian locally compact group or more generally a locally compact quantum group, a class of Hopf algebra related to von Neumann algebras. An analogous theory has also been developed for actions on C* algebras and their crossed products. Duality first appeared for actions of the reals in the work of Connes and Takesaki on the classification of Type III factors. According to Tomita‚ÄìTakesaki theory, every vector which is cyclic for the factor and its commutant gives rise to a 1-parameter modular automorphism group. The corresponding crossed product is a Type II_\\\\infty von Neumann algebra and the corresponding dual action restricts to an ergodic action of the reals on its centre, an Abelian von Neumann algebra. This ergodic flow is called the flow of weights; it is independent of the choice of cyclic vector. The Connes spectrum, a closed subgroup of the positive reals ‚Ñù+, is obtained by applying the exponential to the kernel of this flow. * When the kernel is the whole of R, the factor is type III_1. * When the kernel is (\\\\log \\\\lambda) Z for \\\\lambda in (0,1), the factor is type III_\\\\lambda. * When the kernel is trivial, the factor is type III_0. Connes and Haagerup proved that the Connes spectrum and the flow of weights are complete invariants of hyperfinite Type III factors. From this classification and results in ergodic theory, it is known that every infinite-dimensional hyperfinite factor has the form L^\\\\infty(X)\\\\rtimes Z for some free ergodic action of Z. Examples *If we take the algebra A to be the complex numbers C, then the crossed product A \\\\rtimes G is called the von Neumann group algebra of G. *If G is an infinite discrete group such that every conjugacy class has infinite order then the von Neumann group algebra is a factor of type II1. Moreover if every finite set of elements of G generates a finite subgroup (or more generally if G is amenable) then the factor is the hyperfinite factor of type II1.

Farewell to Bosnia was the first part of this cycle, and The Silence, a book about the genocide in Rwanda, was the second. In 1979 Peress traveled to Iran in the midst of the Revolution. His book, Telex Iran: In the Name of Revolution, is about the fragile relationship between American and Iranian cultures during the hostage crisis. Peress has also completed other major projects, including a photographic study of the lives of Turkish immigrant workers in Germany, and an examination of the contemporary legacy of the Latin American liberator Simon Bolivar. Peress participated in the photography collective This Place, organized by photographer Fr√©d√©ric Brenner. For his project, Peress focused on the village of Silwan, where there are frequent violent clashes between Palestinians and Jewish settlers, and used large format cameras to document his experience. Peter Galassi, Chief Curator of the Department of Photography at the Museum of Modern Art in New York has said of Peress, \\"Over the past four decades, in one ambitious project after another, Gilles Peress has creatively transformed and reinvigorated photography‚Äôs tradition of engaged reportage. Perhaps the most ambitious and sustained of all of those projects is his richly textured and deeply moving visual essay on two decades of bitter conflict that devastated Northern Ireland in the wake of Bloody Sunday in 1972. That extended essay has the gripping immediacy and epic sweep of a novel by Tolstoy.\\" Publications *Telex Persan. With Gholam Hassan Saedi.

History In 1803, Nusplingen became a possession of the Principality of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, who traded the town in 1813 to the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg for Beuron Abbey. Nusplingen was assigned to and remained in that district until its dissolution in 1938. Following that dissolution, Nusplingen was reassigned to the . This district was itself dissolved in 1973, when , and Nusplingen was assigned to the newly-created Zollernalb district. After World War II, the town grew and industrialized beginning in the 1950s with development at its northern extremity. Geography The municipality (Gemeinde) of Nusplingen is located at the southern edge of the Zollernalb district of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, a state of the Federal Republic of Germany. It lies along the border with Tuttlingen district to the south and Sigmaringen to the east. Nusplingen is physically located in the middle of the , part of the larger regions of the and the Upper Danube Nature Park. Its primary watercourse is the B√§ra river, which flows through the municipality from north to south and whose valley dominates its landscape. Elevation above sea level in the municipal area ranges from a low of Normalnull (NN) along the B√§ra to a high of NN at the top of the Staufenberg. Part of the Federally-protected and nature reserves are located in the municipality. Coat of arms Nusplingen's coat of arms shows an eagle's leg, with claws bared, in yellow upon a field of red. This pattern was taken from that of an extinct local noble family and was approved for official use by the provisional post-WWWII W√ºrttemberg-Hohenzollern government on 16 May 1950. Previous municipal emblems include a town seal from 1515 and a pattern of blue-black-yellow wavy bars devised in 1930. A municipal flag corresponding to the coat of arms was issued by the Baden-W√ºrttemberg State Ministry of the Interior on 30 August 1967. Transportation Local public transportation is provided by the . Nusplingen was selected to be the endpoint for the Heuberg Railway, but in 1928 Reichenbach was chosen over Nusplingen. railway CitationsExternal links * (in German) Category:Towns in Baden- W√ºrttemberg Category:W√ºrttemberg ","title":"Nusplingen"},{"id":"2749513","text":"1965 Lamborghini 350GT 1965 Lamborghini 350GT rear detail 1965 Lamborghini 350GT engine 1965 Lamborghini 350GT rear The Lamborghini 350 GT was a grand tourer manufactured by Lamborghini between 1964 and 1966. It was the first production vehicle produced by Lamborghini. The 350 GT was based on the earlier Lamborghini 350 GTV and was equipped with a 3.5 liter V12 engine and a 2-door coup√© body by Carrozzeria Touring. The 350 GT debuted at the March 1964 Geneva Motor Show and production began the following May. The success of this model ensured the company's survival, establishing it as a viable competitor with rival manufacturer Ferrari. HistoryInitial design team= After the testing of his prototype Lamborghini engine in May 1963, then-lead engineer Giotto Bizzarrini left the company. The following month Ferruccio Lamborghini tasked engineer Gian Paolo Dallara with developing a production version of Bizzarrini's 350GTV grand tourer. Dallara was assisted in this project by engineer Paolo Stanzani and test driver Bob Wallace. Dallara and Stanzani quickly realized that the 350 GTV was not properly designed for mass production. They began working in parallel on two projects that would result in the production 350 GT. First, they began de-tuning the original Bizzarrini engine and redesigning the original Bizzarrini chassis for street use. Second, they started readying the 350 GTV for its late-October 1963 Turin Auto Show debut, where Lamborghini hoped it would raise interest in the eventual production 350 GT.Pasini, Stefano \\"Lamborghini 350 GTV.\\" Rivista Lamborghini Review, 1991 =Redesigning the GTV Prototype= The 350 GT shared a number of features with the 350 GTV prototype, including a four-wheel independent suspension, the quad-cam 3.5 liter Lamborghini V12, and an aluminium body. A number of mechanical revisions and refinements were made due to the suggestions of the Neri and Bonacini racing development shop and test driver Bob Wallace. The body was redesigned by Carrozzeria Touring, retaining the original profile while cleaning up details of the design to result in a more cohesive appearance. Most noticeable was the replacement of the prototype's rotating hidden headlights with fixed headlights. As equipped to the 350 GTV, the Bizzarrini-designed 3.5 liter V12 was essentially a race motor, potentially developing at 11,000rpm. In order to fit his grand touring car with a smoother, more pleasant, longer-lasting engine that would be \\"good for 40,000 hard miles between services,\\" Ferruccio had Dallara and Wallace de-tune a version of this prototype GTV motor for street use. This included: *Replacing the elaborate and costly racing-style dry sump oiling system with a conventional wet sump system *Reducing the compression ratio from 11.0:1 or above to 9.4:1 *Cutting back on the exotic materials specified for the crankshaft and other components to reduce cost *Relocating the distributors to more accessible positions on the fronts of the exhaust camshafts *Adoption of a single, very tall Lamborghini-made oil filter *Replacing the expensive 36 mm down-draft racing Weber carburetors with conventional, inexpensive side-draft 40 DCOE Webers. This resolved clearance problems seen in the GTV prototype and enabled the exceptionally low hood line Ferruccio desired. *Softening the cam profiles for smoother running during street driving This first \\"detuned\\" L350 engine was tested on October 3, 1963. The resultlater fit in the 350 GTwas a very capable 270 bhp power plant that could reach in top form. While this 350 GT design work continued, the 350 GTV prototype was rushed to completion for the upcoming October 26 press meeting and the subsequent inauguration of the Turin Auto Show on the 30th. The 350GTV was shown at the Turin Auto Show with the original Bizzarrini \\"racing\\" V-12 enginewith its downdraft webers, rear distributors, etc.displayed alongside as it was not \\"adapted to the chassis.\\" The car was a static display with the suspension arms simply tack-welded in place and the engine not installed. Lukewarm reaction to the car caused Ferruccio Lamborghini to postpone plans for immediate production and move on to introducing Dallara's new 350 GT design. In March 1964, only 5 months after the debut of the GTV in Turin, the \\"redesigned GTV\\"now called the 350 GTwas debuted at the Geneva Auto Show. It was greeted with sufficient enthusiasm that Ferruccio decided to proceed with production in May 1964. =Manufacturing and assembly= The manufacture of the bodies was entrusted to Touring of Milan, who used their patented Superleggera method of construction to fix aluminium alloy panels directly to a tubular structure. The first 350 GT frame was fabricated by Neri and Bonacini, who continued to act as Lamborghini's chassis supplier until production of the 350 GT was underway, when the job was turned over to Marchesi. Chassis and bodies were mated at Touring, which then delivered the complete assemblieswith even the bumpers in placeto the Lamborghini factory. The cars could be ordered in several colors. The first 350 GT chassis and body, delivered to the Lamborghini factory on March 9, 1964, was named No. 101 (Touring No. 17001). That same month No. 101 debuted at the Geneva show. The first customer delivery of a 350 GT was No. 104 (Touring No. 17004), delivered on July 31, 1964. Production increased slowly. Despite the initial goal of building 10 cars a week, less than 25 cars were delivered to customers in 1964. Lamborghini produced one hundred-twenty 350 GTs before replacing it with the Lamborghini 400 GT in 1966. Many 350 GTs were subsequently fit with the larger 4.0 litre engine used in the 400 GT, in order to take advantage of the later engine's greater power and better replacement parts availability. Specifications The 350 GT had an all-aluminium alloy V12 engine mated to a five-speed ZF manual transmission. It had an aluminium body, a Salisbury limited-slip differential, four-wheel independent suspension, and vacuum servo-assisted Girling disc brakes all round. The 350 GT was originally fitted with Pirelli Cinturato HS 205-section tyres. It had a wheelbase of , with a front and rear axle track of . It measured long by wide and was by high. With its kerb weight of , the 350 GT could accelerate from in 6.8 seconds, and from in 16.3 seconds, and go on to reach a top speed of . =Chassis= As was the case with the motor, Bizzarrini's GTV \\"racing\\" chassis design was the basis of Dallara's 350 GT \\"street\\" chassis. The GTV chassis was unsuitable for a street car due to its lightweight construction and small door openings obstructed by tubing. Dallara's redesign for the production 350 GT used larger square- section steel tubing in a central \\"floor\\", with front and rear cradles made from and tubing to support the engine, rear differential and suspension mountings. This design provided easy entry and exit through the doors, aided in the quietness of the car, and provided a solid platform on which to mount the body. =Suspension= The suspension was fully independent, with unequal- length wishbones and coilover shock absorbers. In the rear, the coilover assembly was located to the rear of the suspension wishbone mountings. The rear suspension wishbones were asymmetrical front-to-back, with an offset that brought the rear wheel hubs towards the spring mountings. This arrangement provided increased resistance to torsion and improved stability during acceleration and braking. Anti-roll bars were equipped on front and rear. =Engine= Quality control of the early engines was very high. Each one underwent tests for 24 hours on a Schenk Walge dynamometer, being run for the first 12 hours under electric power, and then with gasoline at increasing speeds, producing at 6500 rpm and of torque at 4500 rpm. A detailed analysis was made of its behavior before installation in the car for at least 500 kilometres of mixed-test running by Wallace.  350 GTS  The Lamborghini 350 GTS was a convertible-roof spider version of the 350 GT, first shown at the November 1965 Turin Auto Show. Two were constructed by Carrozzeria Touring in 1965. When folded down, the convertible top was designed to be concealed in the storage area behind the two seats. Of the two originally built, chassis 0328 was finished in black with an emerald green interior, while chassis 0325 was painted gold with a brown interior.

The character first appeared in Justice League of America #96 (Feb. 1972), and was created by Mike Friedrich and Dick Dillin. Publication history Starbreaker debuted in a three-part storyline that ran in Justice League of America #96-98 (Feb. - May 1972). The first chapter, \\"The Coming of Starbreaker\\" introduced the foe; the second, \\"The Day the Earth Screams\\", featured the origin story of the Justice League and the final chapter \\"No More Tomorrows\\", featured Sargon the Sorcerer, who aids the League in defeating the villain. The character did not appear in DC Comics continuity again until featured in a four-part storyline in Justice League America #62-65 (May - Aug. 1992). Starbreaker eventually returned, revealed to be the mastermind behind a planet abduction in Adam Strange vol. 2, #1 - 8 (Nov. 2004 - June 2005) before a reappearance in Justice League of America vol. 2, #29-34 (March - Aug. 2009). Fictional character biography Three members of the Justice League of America - Flash; Green Lantern and Hawkman - are diverted from a return trip to Earth by their ally and resident of the planet Rann, Adam Strange. Tracing a faint power ring transmission from Green Lantern, Superman joins the heroes on Rann. Strange has enlisted their aid to defeat an energy vampire called Starbreaker, who is intent on destroying Rann and consuming the planetary energy. Although Starbreaker splits into three copies that begin the process, the villain is defeated by Adam Strange and the Justice Leaguers. Intent on vengeance, Starbreaker attacks Earth, initially defeating Superman, Green Lantern and the Flash. The entire Justice League gathers, and after being spurred on by Hawkman, defeat Starbreaker with the aid of Sargon the Sorcerer. The villain is then incarcerated by the Guardians of the Universe.Justice League of America #96-97 (Feb. - March 1972) Starbreaker eventually escapes, and conquers the planet Almerac, intent on devouring its energies. Another version of the Justice League oppose Starbreaker, with member Blue Beetle manipulating the armour of teammate Booster Gold, using it to absorb the energy from which the villain is composed.Justice League America #62-65 (May - Aug. 1992) A death-cultist called Sh'ri Valkyr from the planet Thanagar slowly resuscitates Starbreaker, feeding the villain victims and thereby allowing him to regain a corporeal form. Valkyr plans to use Rann's teleportation technology - the Zeta-Beam - to convert the entire universe into energy to feed Starbreaker, who would rule a new universe. With the help of allies the Omega Men and interplanetary peace-keepers L.E.G.I.O.N., Adam Strange strands Starbreaker in an empty universe devoid of energy. Before being killed, Valkyr retaliates by teleporting Rann to Polaris, home system of the planet Thanagar, beginning the Rann-Thanagar War.Adam Strange vol. 2, #1-8 (Nov. 2004 - June 2005) An incorporeal Starbreaker returns, intent on destroying his primary foes, the Justice League of America. Starbreaker uses the villain the Shadow Thief as a pawn, and locates an entity possessing enough energy to sustain his form for many years. Revealed to be the adult form of a Sun Eater, Starbreaker engages the League in combat and is weakened by Doctor Light and Firestorm, before being shot in the head with an exotic weapon by Paladin (alternative version of Batman). Although Starbreaker's form dissolves, the League acknowledge the defeat is temporary and that the entity will reform.Justice League of America vol. 2, #29-34 (March - Aug. 2009) Powers and abilities The character is initially presented as a humanoid \\"energy vampire\\" with exceptional strength and durability; and capable of flight, energy projection and creating illusions. Starbreaker can also be empowered by draining negative emotions such as hatred and fear from other beings. The entity is eventually revealed to be a mature version of a \\"Sun Eater\\" that requires large amounts of energy to survive, typically draining the energy required from entire stars and then being capable of creating a humanoid form. As an energy entity, however, Starbreaker is susceptible to any device capable of draining energy, which will disperse the humanoid form.

He managed to survive the firing squad's 21 bullets, but Major General Sar Lashgar Buzarjomehri went up to the wounded Puladeen and shot him in the head, finishing the execution.

A native of Beijing, he was the author of the novel Jing Hua Yuan (Èè°Ëä±Á∑£), or Flowers in the Mirror.

Page 284 \\"Chaste and Unchaste Heroines in Jin Yun Qiao and Jinghua Yuan\\" In the first half of the novel, the protagonist, like Gulliver, travels to strange lands, reminiscent of what are mentioned in Shan Hai Jing. The second half of the novel is a display of Li's erudition, and reads more like an encyclopedia than a novel. The Lishi Yinjian, in the line of the rime table tradition, comprises syllable charts which are both innovative and confusing. Like Li's novel, it is a work of erudition, quoting from more than 400 works. It is valuable for its recording of the phonological system of the then-Beijing dialect. From a young age he had a rebellious nature. He strongly disagreed with the fixed style of composition (eight-legged essay) that people were required to learn in order to pass the examination needed to obtain a higher rank. Therefore, after obtaining the degree of xiucai (licentiate, the lowest in the examination hierarchy), he became a low-ranking officer, which was not considered respectable. However, his position did not mean that he was idle; he was a polymath, with expertise in astrology, medicine, mathematics, music, rhetoric, poetry, calligraphy and painting. His knowledge in all these subjects is amply reflected in Flowers in the Mirror, sometimes even to the hindrance of the plot. References *He Jiuying ‰Ωï‰πùÁõà (1995).

The width of Haverstraw Bay is approximately 3.4 miles (5.5 kilometers). The length approximately 5 miles (8 kilometers) from river kilometer 58 (river mile 36) at Croton Point to river kilometer 66 (river mile 41) at Stony Point. The bay is bordered by the village of Haverstraw, in Rockland County, to the west and the village of Croton-on-Hudson, in Westchester County, to the east.  Geography  Haverstraw Bay is bordered to the west by the town and village of Haverstraw and to the east by the northern portion of the town of Ossining, village of Croton-on-Hudson and the southern portion of the town of Cortlandt. Haverstraw Bay is approximately 35 miles (56 kilometers) to the north of New York City. A major feature of the bay is the large peninsula that forms its southern downstream border, Croton Point, which juts almost halfway across the Hudson from the eastern shore. Croton Point Park is a popular birding location, including frequent sightings of the bald eagle. The moderately saline bay is the northern, upstream boundary of the lower Hudson River estuary.lower hudson estuary  Ecology  The bay's physical and biological characteristics make it one of the most significant estuarine areas in the Hudson River. The bay is deeper on its western side with a shipping channel of minimum 32 feet in depth and 300 feet in width. The bay's eastern side is shallower with most of that section of bay not more than 10 feet deep.MapTech Hudson River, Chart 4, Edition 5, 2003. Shallow depths with ample sunlight lead to robust aquatic vegetation. Inflows of brackish Atlantic Ocean water overlaid with fresh stream water promote a nutrient rich environment for myriad invertebrate, fish, and bird species. The bay's ecology plays a central role in the health of fish populations in the Hudson River, including the endangered shortnose sturgeon and the larger, more abundant atlantic sturgeon. New York State has designated Haverstraw Bay a \\"Significant Coastal Fish and Wildlife Habitat\\". Up to the mid-1950s, Haverstraw Bay was once a productive oyster habitat.Stanne, S. et al., The Hudson:An Illustrated Guide to the Living River (Rutgers University Press/Clearwater, New Brunswick, 1996, p. 57) As with the rest of the Hudson, at the microbial level the bay's health is by oxygen concentrations. The bay's water chemistry is affected rain fall, tidal variations, and human induced waste and runoff, as well as seasonal changes in temperature and light.Microbial Ecology of the Hudson River Estuary  Lamont- Doherty Earth Observatory  History  Sanford Robinson Gifford's Morning in the Hudson, Haverstraw Bay, 1866 In 1609, the Dutch East India Company had financed English navigator Henry Hudson to search for the Northwest Passage. In an attempt to find this undiscovered route, Henry Hudson decided to sail his ship up the river that would later be named after him (Hudson River). As he continued up the river, its width expanded, into Haverstraw Bay, leading him to believe he had successfully reached the Northwest Passage. He docked his ship on the western shore of Haverstraw Bay and claimed the territory as the first Dutch settlement in North America. In 1780, spy Major John Andr√© landed at Snedeker's Landing (a.k.a. Waldberg Landing) on the west shore of the bay in the woods below Haverstraw village to meet Benedict Arnold.Adams, Arthur, The Hudson River Guidebook (Fordham University Press, New York, 1996, pp. 146) In 1801, Charles Willson Peale traveled up the Hudson and sketched Stony Point from the bay.

A 3-foot layer of sediment at Tell Leilan containing no evidence of human habitation offered clues as to the cause of the demise of the Akkadian imperial city; analysis indicated that at around 2200 BC, a three-century drought was severe enough to affect agriculture and settlement.Leilan.yale.edu , Harvey Weiss et al., The genesis and collapse of Third Millennium north Mesopotamian Civilization, Science, vol. 291, pp. 995-1088, 1993Leilan.yale.edu , H.

Despite two trials, nobody was convicted of the crime. George was the third son of William Storrs, a very successful builder in Stalybridge, Cheshire. George inherited control of William's business. George lived at Gorse Hall in Stalybridge, with his wife, Maggie (n√©e Middleton). They had married late, he at 30 and she at 35. The marriage was both loveless and childless, unlike that of George's older brother James, and it is possible that this was a cause of friction between the two brothers. Another brother William Henry had died in 1903. Cornelius Howard, a cousin of George Harry Storrs, was originally a petty thief but joined the Army and rose to the rank of Bombardier. Cornelius was not liked by George. When Cornelius approached George for a position in the company, George refused. George's friend Robert Innes, a local solicitor, employed a governess for his children and George began a relationship with the young woman, Maria Hohl. Maria suddenly decided to leave Stalybridge, purportedly to attend Oxford University. She then returned, equally as suddenly, some eight months later but did not see George again. GoodmanJonathan Goodman, The Stabbing of George Harry Storrs, Allison & Busby, London 1983 wrote that Maria gave birth to a child during her absence from Stalybridge. After her return to Stalybridge, Maria Hohl committed suicide by drowning herself in a canal. Robert Innes was a distant relation to George Harry Storrs through marriage. Robert Innes' first wife was Eliza Storrs and they had a daughter Eliza Storrs Innes. Eliza's father, John Storrs was involved in the management of Taylor, Lang & Co the major textile engineering company in the town. He and his cousin William, George Harry's father, lived next door to each other in Mottram Road, Stalybridge.1881 England and Wales Census After Maria's death, George started receiving anonymous threatening letters. Due to her death he felt he had a debt to pay and felt that he would be killed. This meant he could only really confide in his faithful servant, James Worrell. Shortly afterwards, Gorse Hall was attacked twice. The first attack, Goodman held, was staged (Goodman called it a burlesque), so that the police would take the threats seriously. A gun barrel was thrust through a window. This was probably done by Worrell. The attack made the police start patrols of the ground and a bell was installed to summon help in times of danger. George tested the bell, causing a lot of goodwill for George to evaporate. The second attack on the evening of 1 November 1909, was the fatal one. After \\"testing\\" the bell, George was not told by the police that they were protecting election buildings - this meant that help only arrived as he was dying. Maggie Storrs rang the bell for the second attack, and refused to attend her husband's side as he lay dying, possibly to avoid hearing a confession of infidelity from her dying husband and thereby protecting her own reputation. Despite witnesses reporting seeing an intruder with a gun, Storrs was stabbed to death, with 15 stabs being noted on his body. There were two trials: the first for George Harry's cousin, Cornelius Howard, who was acquitted and the second for another local man, Mark Wilde. Wilde was brought to the attention of investigators after he had attacked a young courting couple. Both Howard and Wilde were defended by barrister Edward Theophilus Nelson, a British Guianan who had graduated from St John's College, Oxford, in 1902.Jeffrey P. Green, Black Edwardians: Black people in Britain, 1901-1914, Taylor & Francis, 1998, , p.199 James Worrell committed suicide, by hanging himself, shortly after the burial of his employer. Suspects The two trials both resulted in acquittals and nobody was definitely proven to be the murderer. However, there are quite a few suspects. The case is examined in The Stabbing of George Harry Storrs by Jonathan Goodman, and featured in an episode of the television series In Suspicious Circumstances in 1995 \\"In Suspicious Circumstances\\" The Golden Goose (1995) and Julian Fellowes Investigates: A Most Mysterious Murder in 2005. * James morrell worked with knives and guns, but had no reason to murder his employer. * Some people felt that James Storrs and/or Maggie Storrs hired a hitman. While James had no real motive, Maggie probably did know about Maria's baby. * Cornelius had no alibi, but again, had no real reason. * Mark Wilde had a compelling case against him, even though his mother had given an alibi for him. He suffered from mood swings, possibly caused by syphilis. He and George were enemies and he did have a conviction for a violent offence. * Fellowes also believes that the younger brother of Maria Hohl, one John Gottfried Hohl, was the killer, and did it for revenge. This possibility was outlined by Goodman in 1983. A year after the murder, Mrs Storrs had Gorse Hall torn down. Modern day In November 2009, the Friends of Gorse Hall, in conjunction with the Two Boards and a Passion Theatre Company, staged a walk through the town which culminated at the site of Gorse Hall. On the way, they stopped at the pub where James Worrell was drinking, and the theatre company performed scenes whilst in period dress. In April 2010, a local historian stated that he thought the murderer was someone else, as the description given by the cook of the house did not fit either of the men who were sent for trial. The new suspect was convicted of killing his lover, Hannah Etchells, and dumping her body in a canal. This murder occurred just a few months after the Storrs murder, and it is believed that the new suspect confessed to Etchells and then murdered her when he thought she was going to go to the police. The description of the new suspect fits that given by the cook on the night of the Storrs murder.

His work on \\"L'Arch√©om√®tre\\" deeply influenced the young Ren√© Gu√©non. He developed the term Synarchy‚Äîthe association of everyone with everyone else‚Äîinto a political philosophy, and his ideas about this type of government proved influential in politics and the occult. BiographyEarly years= Born in Paris, from a family of Parisian intellectuals and son of psychiatrist Guillaume-Alexandre Saint-Yves, he started his career as a physician at a naval academy in Brest which he soon abandoned after becoming ill. In 1863 he relocated to Jersey where he connected with Victor Hugo. In 1870, he returned to France to fight in the Franco-Prussian War during which he was injured. He then began a career as a civil servant. In 1877, Saint-Yves met and married Countess Marie de Riznitch-Keller, a relative of Honor√© de Balzac, and friend of the Empress Eug√©nie de Montijo, a move which made him independently wealthy. He dedicated the rest of his life to research and had a large number of influential contacts including Victor Hugo. Saint-Yves later knew many of the major names in French occultism such as Marquis Stanislas de Guaita, Jos√©phin P√©ladan and Oswald Wirth and was a member of a number of Rosicrucian, and Freemason style orders. Saint-Yves supposedly inherited the papers of one of the great founders of French occultism, Antoine Fabre d'Olivet (1762‚Äì1825). In 1877, he published the \\"Lyrical Testament\\", a collection of poetry, and \\"Keys of the Orient\\". In the latter book, he presents a solution (based on developing a religious understanding between Jews, Christians and Muslims) to the \\"Question of the Orient\\", brought about by the decay of the Ottoman Empire which caused tensions in the Near and Middle East. He also began to study the development of industrial applications of marine plants (\\"Utilising extracts from seaweed\\" was published in 1879) but he could not perform the operation for lack of capital. In 1880, he was granted the title of Marquis of Alveydre by the government of San Marino. His book the Mission des Juifs (1884) was favourable to Jews. The material from it was used for The Secret of the Jews, an anti- semitic tract attributed to Yuliana Glinka. =Development of Synarchy= Saint-Yves used the term Synarchy in his book La France vraie to describe what he believed was the ideal form of government.Saint-Yves d'Alveydre, La France vraie (Paris: Calmann L√©vy, 1887). In reaction to the emergence of anarchist ideologies and movements, Saint-Yves had elaborated a more conservative political-theological formula over a series of 4 books from 1882 onwards which he believed would result in a harmonious society by considering it as an organic unity. This ideal was based partially on his idealised view of life in medieval Europe and also on his ideas about successful government in India, Atlantis, and Ancient Egypt. He defended social differentiation and hierarchy with co-operation between social classes, transcending conflict between social and economic groups: Synarchy, as opposed to anarchy. Specifically, Saint-Yves envisioned a European society with a government composed of three councils, representing economic power, judicial power, and scientific community, of which the metaphysical chamber bound the whole structure together.Andr√© Nataf, The Wordsworth Dictionary of the Occult (Wordsworth Editions Ltd; 1994). These ideas were also influenced by works such as Plato's The Republic and by Martinism. They also influenced the young Ren√© Gu√©non who published several articles on l'Arch√©om√®tre in his early life. L'Arch√©om√®tre was edited and published by G√©rard Encausse alias Papus after Saint-Yves' death. As part of this concept of government Alexandre Saint-Yves d'Alveydre, gave an important role to secret societies or, more precisely, esoteric societies, which are composed of oracles and who safeguarded the government from behind the scenes. He saw the Rosicrucians as having fulfilled this role in medieval Europe and was involved with a number of Freemason and other groups who claimed descent from the Knights Templars. =Contact with Agartha= During 1885, Saint-Yves was supposedly visited by a group of Eastern Initiates, one of them being named prince Hardjij Scharipf. It was then that he associated synarchy with \\"ascended masters\\" based in caverns of Agartha, who supposedly communicated with him telepathically. He wrote about this secret location in his \\"Mission de l'Inde en Europe\\" published in 1886. Worried he had revealed too much and apparently under the influence of his oriental contacts, he destroyed all but two copies of this book. One of which was owned by G√©rard Encausse alias Papus, who edited and published it in 1910. Saint-Yves believed that an ancient synarchist world government was transferred to Agartha (or Aggartha) within a hollow Earth at the start of the Kali Yuga age, around 3,200 B.C.Joscelyn Godwyn, Arktos: The Polar Myth in Science, Symbolism, and Nazi Survival, p.84 (Adventures Unlimited Press, USA; 1996). Saint-Yves d'Alveydre was the man who really introduced the concept of Agartha to the Western world. This concept was later developed by Zam Bothiva and the Fraternit√© des Polaires in France, and more importantly by the Thule-Gesellschaft in Nationalist circles of Germany. =Final Years= After Saint-Yves's death, portions of the writings he left behind were compiled by a group of his friends and devotees driven by G√©rard Encausse alias Papus into a volume entitled l'Arch√©om√®tre. The title is Saint-Yves's name for a color-coded diagram he developed, showing symbolic correspondences between elements in astrology, music, alphabets, gematria, and other areas. This book has been translated into Spanish, and was translated into English for the first time in 2007 (publication pending). Influence Saint-Yves's main disciple was the prominent occultist G√©rard Encausse alias Papus who established a number of societies based on Synarchist ideas. Other notable followers included Victor Blanchard (1878‚Äì1953), Nizier Anthelme Philippe, Ren√© A. Schwaller de Lubicz, Ren√© Gu√©non and Emile Dantinne. Saint-Yves's ideas influenced the turbulent French politics of the early twentieth century where they served as a model for a number of right-wing groups and also in Mexico where synarchist groups have had a major political role. Theories concerning Synarchist groups also have become a key element in a number of conspiracy theories. =Saint-Yves on The Great Sphinx of Giza= One of Saint-Yves's most influential theories nowadays was a minor feature of his work. This is his claim that the Great Sphinx was much older than Egyptologists thought, being created around 12,000 B.C. He believed the Sphinx was created by escapees from the destruction of Atlantis. He did not base this claim on any physical evidence. Saint-Yves' disciple Ren√© A. Schwaller de Lubicz was thus inspired to investigate the age of the Sphinx and as a result inspired an ongoing Great Sphinx controversy over the age of the monument.

Potts (1999). The Archaeology of Elam. Cambridge University Press. p. 122. He mentions his father'name as ≈†impi-i≈°huk, which, being an Elamite name, suggests that Puzur-Inshuhinak himself was Elamite. In the inscription of the \\"Table au Lion\\", he appears as \\"Puzur-Inshushin(ak) Ensi (Governor) of Susa, Shakkanakku (Military Governor) of the country of Elam\\" ( puzur-inshushinak ensi shushiki skakkanakku mati NIMki), a title used by his predecessors Eshpum, Epirmupi and Ili-ishmani as governors of the Akkadian Empire for the territory of Elam.Translation into French in In another inscription, he calls himself the \\"Mighty King of Elam\\", suggesting an accession to independence from the weakening Akkadian Empire. Rule His father was Shinpi-khish-khuk, the crown prince, and most likely a brother of king Khita. Kutik-Inshushinak's first position was as governor of Susa, which he may have held from a young age. About 2110 BC, his father died, and he became crown prince in his stead. Elam had been under the domination of Akkad since the time of Sargon, and Kutik-Inshushinak accordingly campaigned in the Zagros mountains on their behalf. He was greatly successful as his conquests seem to have gone beyond the initial mission. In 2090 BC, he asserted his independence from king Shar-Kali-Sharri of the Akkadian Empire, which had been weakening ever since the death of Naram-Sin, thus making himself king of Elam. He conquered Anshan and managed to unite most of Elam into one kingdom. According to the inscriptions of Ur-Nammu, Puzur-Inshushinak conquered numerous cities in central Mesopotamia, including Eshnunna and Akkad, and probably Akshak.\\"According to one of Ur-Namma‚Äôs inscriptions, which describes his conÔ¨Çictwith Puzur-InÀásuÀásinak, the latter occupied the cities of Awal, Kismar, and MaÀáskan-Àásarrum, and the lands of EÀásnuna, Tutub, Zimudar, and Akkade. The prolog to Ur-Namma‚Äôs code adds to list the northern Babylonian cities of Marda, GIRkal, Kazalu, and probably Ak Àásak?, plus their rural settlements.\\" in His conquests probably encroached considerably on Gutian territory, gravely weakening them, and making them unbable to withstand the Neo-Sumerian revolt of Utu-hengal. The name \\"Kutik-Inshushinak\\" (Elamite name of Puzur-Inshushinak), in Linear Elamite script (right to left). He built extensively on the citadel at Susa, and encouraged the use of the Linear Elamite script to write the Elamite language. This may be seen as a reaction against Sargon's attempt to force the use of Akkadian. Most inscriptions in Linear Elamite date from the reign of Kutik-Inshushinak. His achievements were not long-lasting, for after his death the linear script fell into disuse, and Susa was overrun by the Third dynasty of Ur under Ur-Nammu and his son Shulgi. The Ur III dynasty had held control over Susa after the demise of Puzur- Inshushinak, and they built numerous buildings and temples there. This control was continued by Shulgi as shown by his numerous dedications in the city- state. He also engaged in marital alliances, by marrying his daughters to rulers of eastern territories, such as Anshan, Marhashi and Bashime. Concomitantly, Elam fell under control of the Shimashki dynasty (also Elamite of origin).Encyclopedia Iranica: Elam - Simashki dynasty, F. Vallat It is now known that his reign in Elam overlapped with that of Ur-Nammu of Ur- III,Wilcke; See Encyclopedia Iranica articles AWAN, ELAM although the previous lengthy estimates of the duration of the intervening Gutian dynasty and rule of Utu-hengal of Uruk had not allowed for that synchronism. Ur-Nammu, who styled himself \\"King of Sumer and Akkad\\" is probably the one who, early in his reign, reconquered the northern territories that had been occupied by Puzur- Inshushinak, before going on to conquer Susa.

It gets a brief mention on William Roy's eighteenth century map of the Scottish Lowlands. In the nineteenth century it was no more than a farm steading. An early map shows just a few buildings existed in 1864. By the start of the First World War it had not grown significantly, although there was a school near the railway station. It was sometimes spelled Carbrane. Even in 1956 Carbrain was mostly farmland with a small burn flowing through it. The map seems to show this flowing possibly down the Gully and eventually feeding the Red Burn in the Vault Glen. This burn isn't named so can't be identified with the Horseward Burn from historic maps. Derek Lyddon and James Latimer designed much of the housing in the 1960s. Construction of Cumbernauld began in 1963, and most areas of Carbrain were inhabited by the early 1970s. For the first several years, Carbrain was considered to be highly desirable as an escape from poor housing in the Glasgow area. As newer developments have been constructed in the Cumbernauld area, Carbrain has fallen into disrepair despite periods of renovation. For example over ¬£70 million was spent building new houses around Beechwood Court watched over by Andy Scott's artwork Vitruvian Girl. Most recently there have been proposals to renovate Millcroft Road. Carbrain contains ten residential areas (Carbrain 1, 2, 3 & 4, 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14), four churches (Carbrain Baptist Church, Cumbernauld Free Church, Cumbernauld United Reformed Church and St. Margaret of Scotland Primary), two pubs (The Twa Corbies and The Jack Snipe), several local shops located throughout the site, along with a number of community buildings like the Red Cross Centre. Carbrain is supposed to have the Town Centre as its focus, so there was thought to be no need for serious scale entertainment or grocery shops. Underpasses between Glenhove and Torbrex Roads Carbrain was split into two sections: North and South. North Carbrain, which was built first, included Glenhove Road, Torbrex Road, Stonylee Road, Craigyburn Road, Beechwood Road and Glenacre Road. North Carbrain is within five minutes walking distance from the Town Centre, health centre and sports centre. South Carbrain includes Millcroft Road, Greenrigg Road, Kilbowie Road, Broomlands Road, and Sandyknowes, some of which are a five-minute walk from the train station. The town centre is approximately a ten-minute walk from South Carbrain. View from Train Station to South Carbrain Carbrain was designed around pedestrians and, as such, has paths intertwining among its many streets. It is possible to get from one part of Carbrain to another using only footpaths. It was also designed so that pedestrians never had to walk alongside or cross a road. Hillcrest was never part of Carbrain although Carbrain Temporary School became, the now demolished, Hillcrest Primary in 1971. For that reason there is a community council for \\"Carbrain and Hillcrest\\" rather than just Carbrain. There were three primary schools within this area. Most children who lived in these areas would have attended Langlands Primary, St Joseph's Primary or Carbrain Primary (which celebrated its 50th birthday in 2016). These primaries were feeder schools for Cumbernauld High School, Greenfaulds High School or Our Lady's High School. St Margaret of Scotland Primary replaced St Joseph's Primary during a period of reorganisation. Carbrain Boys Club is a voluntary football club who are organising a festival in June 2017.

Greyfriars traces its origin to the south- west parish of Edinburgh, founded in 1598. Initially, this congregation met in the western portion of St Giles'. The church is named for the Observantine Franciscans or \\"Grey Friars\\" who arrived in Edinburgh from the Netherlands in the mid-15th century and were granted land for a Friary at the south-western edge of the burgh. In the wake of the Scottish Reformation, the grounds of the abandoned Friary were repurposed as a cemetery, in which the current church was constructed between 1602 and 1620. In 1638, National Covenant was signed in the Kirk. The church was damaged during the Protectorate, when it was used as barracks by troops under Oliver Cromwell. In 1718, an explosion destroyed the church tower. During the reconstruction, the church was partitioned to hold two congregations: Old Greyfriars and New Greyfriars. In 1845, fire ravaged Old Greyfriars. After its reconstruction, the minister, Robert Lee, introduced the first organ and stained glass windows in a Scottish parish church since the Reformation. In 1929, Old and New Greyfriars united and the church was restored as one sanctuary. In the following years, the depopulation of the Old Town saw Greyfriars unite with a number of neighbouring congregations. The church of Greyfriars is a simple aisled nave of eight bays; the style is Survival Gothic fused with Baroque elements. The church initially consisted of six bays and a west tower. After the explosion of 1718 destroyed the tower, Alexander McGill added two new bays and a Palladian north porch to create one building divided into two churches of four bays each. After it was gutted by fire in 1845, David Cousin rebuilt Old Greyfriars with an open, un- aisled interior. Between 1932 and 1938, the interior and arcades were restored by Henry F. Kerr. Notable features of the church include historic stained glass windows by James Ballantine; the 17th century monument to Margaret, Lady Yester; and an original copy of the National Covenant of 1638. Since the 18th century, the congregations of Greyfriars have been notable for their missionary work within the parish. This continues to the present day through the church's work with the Grassmarket Community Project and the Greyfriars Charteris Centre. Greyfriars holds weekly Gaelic services, maintaining a tradition of Gaelic worship in Edinburgh that goes back to the beginning of the 18th century. HistoryEdinburgh's Grey Friars= Observatine Franciscans first came to Scotland in 1447 at the invitation of James I. The six friars, including one Scot, arrived from the Low Countries under the leadership of Cornelius of Zierikzee. They settled at the corner of the Grassmarket and Candlemaker Row in either 1453 or 1458. In 1464, the Provost of St Giles' granted the Chapel of St John outwith the West Port to Friar Crannok, Warden of the Grey Friars. The fate of this Chapel is unknown.Bryce 1912, p. 11. The Friary enjoyed royal patronage and connections: it hosted Mary of Guelders on her arrival in Edinburgh in 1449 and sheltered Henry VI of England during his exile.Bryce 1912, pp. 14-15 James IV was particularly close to the Edinburgh Grey Friars: he appointed himself the Observatines' \\"Royal Protector\\" and Friar Ranny, Warden of the Edinburgh Grey Friars, served as the King's confessor.Bryce 1912, pp. 16-18. By the middle of the 16th century, there were always fifty to sixty friars resident.Bryce 1912, p. 15. The Friary was first caught up in the Scottish Reformation in 1558: Reformers stole the statue of Saint Giles from the burgh church and the Greyfriars loaned their statue of the saint for use in the Saint Giles' Day procession on 1 September that year. The statue was damaged when Reformers broke up the procession.Bryce 1912, p. 25. When news reached Edinburgh of the advance of the Lords of the Congregation on 28 June 1559, Lord Seton, Provost of Edinburgh, abandoned his commitment to protect the Grey Friars, leaving their Friary to be ransacked by a mob. The friars sheltered among their allies in the city.Bryce 1912, p. 26. In the summer of 1560, Scotland's Observantine Franciscans, including all but one or two of the Edinburgh Grey Friars, left the country for the Netherlands: these exiles numbered about eighty friars and were led by the Provincial Minister, John Patrick.Bryce 1912, pp. 27-28. =Beginnings= By 1565, all the buildings of the Friary had been removed and their stones carried away for use in the construction of the New Tolbooth and to repair St Giles' and its kirkyard walls.Bryce 1912, p. 30. The kirkyard of St Giles' was, by then, overcrowded and Mary, Queen of Scots had, in 1562, given the grounds of the Friary to the town council to use as a burial ground.Dunlop 1988, p. 74. The west end of St Giles' prior to 19th century alterations. From its foundation in 1598, the congregation of Edinburgh's south-west parish met in the upper storey of the Tolbooth partition in the west end of St Giles' The congregation of Greyfriars can trace its origin to a 1584 edict of the town council to divide Edinburgh into four parishes. This created a south-west parish with the intention it would meet in the central section of St Giles'. This edict does not appear to have been enforced until 1598, when the south-west parish was allocated to the Upper Tolbooth partition at the west end of St Giles'. Robert Rollock and Peter Hewat were appointed the first ministers.Dunlop 1988, p. 78. By the end of the 16th century, St Giles' could no longer accommodate Edinburgh's growing population. In 1599, the town council had discussed and abandoned proposals to construct a new church in the grounds of Kirk o%27 Field (around modern-day Chambers Street). In 1601, the council decided to build a new church in the southern part of the Greyfriars burying ground. Construction commenced in 1611, using material from the Convent of Catherine of Siena at Sciennes. The Kirk was first used on 18 February 1619 for the funeral of the William Couper, Bishop of Galloway; John Spottiswoode, Archbishop of St Andrews, preached the funeral sermon.Bryce 1912, p. 40. Congregational worship was first held on Christmas Day 1620.Steele 1993, p. 5. Though this was a Monday, the minister, Patrick Galloway, chose to hold the service on Christmas Day to curry favour with James VI, who disapproved of the radical Reformers' opposition to holy days.Steele 1993, p. 9.Bryce 1912, pp. 40-41. =Covenant and conflict= At the establishment of the Diocese of Edinburgh in 1633, the ministers of Greyfriars were placed on the list of prebendaries of St Giles%27 Cathedral. In 1637, Charles I attempted to impose a Service Book on the Church of Scotland. On 23 July that year, James Fairlie read the new service book in Greyfriars: this caused a tumult, in which Fairlie exchanged curses with the women of the congregation.Bryce 1912, p. 52. Fairlie's colleague, Andrew Ramsay, refused to read the Service Book the following Sunday and was deposed by royal authority.Gray 1940, p. 34.Bryce 1912, p. 53. The signing of the National Covenant at Greyfriars in 1638 The events of 23 July mirrored a similar incident and riot at St Giles' on the same day. Resistance to Charles and William Laud's interference in the Scottish church resulted in the National Covenant. The Covenant was first read by Archibald Johnston of Warriston from the pulpit of Greyfriars; Scotland's nobility and gentry then signed the Covenant inside the church. Copies of the Covenant were carried throughout Edinburgh and Leith to be signed by the masses.Bryce 1912, p. 88. The formation and subsequent ascendancy of the Covenanters led to the Bishops%27 Wars, the first conflict of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. In 1650, as troops of Oliver Cromwell approached Edinburgh, all able-bodied men of the town were ordered to assemble in the kirkyard. Cromwell took the city after the defeat of the Covenanters at Dunbar and, between 1650 and 1653, Cromwell's troops occupied the church as a cavalry barracks and caused significant damage.Steele 1993, p. 6.Gray 1940, p. 36. Cromwell himself may have preached in Greyfriars.Steele 1993, p. 11. In 1656, the church was divided by a partition wall in anticipation of the creation of two new parishes in Edinburgh; this never happened and the partition was removed in 1662. In 1660, General Monck announced in Greyfriars his intention to march south in support of the Restoration. After the Restoration, episcopacy was re-established in the Church of Scotland: this led to a new period of rebellion for the Covenanters. Robert Traill, the covenanting minister of Greyfriars, was forced into exile and Covenanters were imprisoned in a field adjoining the kirkyard after the Battle of Bothwell Brig in 1679. After the Glorious Revolution, Presbyterian polity was re-established in the Church of Scotland. William Carstares, who had served as chaplain and adviser to William II, served as minister of Greyfriars between 1703 and 1707.Steele 1993, p. 11. =Destruction and reconstruction: 1718-1843= From 1706, the town council used the tower at the west end of Greyfriars as a gunpowder store; this exploded at around 1.45 a.m. on Sunday, 7 May 1718, destroying the tower and severely damaging the west end of the church.RCAHMS 1951, p. 46. The congregation met in the chapel of George Heriot%27s School and the \\"Lower Commonhall\\" of the University of Edinburgh while the church was repaired.Bryce 1912, pp. 135-136. Alexander McGill oversaw repairs to the church. A new wall was erected to enclose the eastern four bays within a month of the explosion. Two new bays were added to the west end: this created a church divided into two equal halves. The work was completed by 31 December 1722 and the costs were met by a local duty on ale.Steele 1993, p. 7.Bryce 1912, p. 137. The following autumn, the town council ordered the formation of a new congregation to occupy the western half of the Kirk and William Robertson was elected its first minister: this was known Wester Greyfriars then as New Greyfriars.Dunlop 1988, p. 84. The original congregation met in the eastern half and became known as Old Greyfriars.Dunlop 1988, pp. 78-79. From the schools' foundations to the late 19th century, New Greyfriars contained lofts for the pupils of the Merchant Maiden Hospital and George Heriot%27s School, who had moved from Old Greyfriars; after 1871, the pupils of George Watson%27s College also attended services in the church.Dunlop 1988, p. 84.Steele 1993, p. 12.Bryce 1912, p. 138. In 1840, St John's Church on Victoria Street was formed from the parish of Old Greyfriars; the minister of the second charge in Old Greyfriars, Thomas Guthrie, became the first minister of St John‚Äôs. At the Disruption of 1843, John Sym, the minister Old Greyfriars, left to join the Free Church; although many of his congregation left with him, all the elders remained.Steele 1993, p. 13.Bryce 1912, p. 145 =Fire and the \\"Greyfriars Revolution\\"= On 19 January 1845, a boiler flue overheated, causing a fire that gutted Old Greyfriars and damaged the roof and furnishings of New Greyfriars. As it happened soon after the Disruption of 1843, some suggested the fire was divine judgement on the established church. Hugh Miller unsuccessfully argued the congregations should move to St John's Church on Victoria Street and leave Greyfriars as a scenic ruin. The majority of the town council's members had joined the Free Church and their attempts to frustrate the restoration were one of the reasons it ended up taking twelve years.Bryce 1912, p. 147. The congregation temporarily decamped to the Tolbooth Kirk. The exterior of Greyfriars as restored by David Cousin after the fire of 1845. Note the contrast in the shape of the roof between Old Greyfriars (right) and New Greyfriars (left). During the restoration of Old Greyfriars under David Cousin, painted glass was installed at the request of the minister, Robert Lee: this was the first coloured glass to be installed in a building of the Church of Scotland since the Reformation.Steele 1993, p. 8. After the church reopened in 1857, Lee embarked upon what became known as \\"the Greyfriars Revolution\\": he introduced a service book of his own devising and pioneered the practices of standing for praise, kneeling for worship, and saying prepared prayers.Gray 1940, p. 40 These practices were innovative in Scottish Presbyterianism and Lee temporarily desisted under pressure from the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. Later, he resumed the practice of prepared prayers and installed a harmonium in 1863 and an organ in 1865. Lee died in 1868 before further action could be taken against him.Dunlop 1988, p. 79. Lee proved highly influential in the development of Presbyterian liturgy: pipe organs, stained glass, prepared prayers, and standing for praise would all become common in the Church of Scotland during the decades after Lee's death.Gray 1940, pp. 40-41. =20th and 21st centuries= In 1929, the congregations of Old and New Greyfriars united. Between 1932 and 1938, the whole church was restored by Henry F. Kerr and the wall that had divided the two congregations was removed.Dunlop 1988, p. 88. In 1938, the congregation of Lady Yester%27s Kirk united with Greyfriars; the congregation of the New North Church joined Greyfriars in 1941.Dunlop 1988, pp. 91, 93. On 28 February 1979, the congregation of Highland, Tolbooth, St John's united with Greyfriars and the new congregation adopted the name \\"Greyfriars, Tolbooth, and Highland Kirk\\". Initially, the congregation used both churches but it was decided in 1981 only to use Greyfriars. Since this union, Greyfriars has maintained the tradition of the Edinburgh's Highland congregation by hosting regular Gaelic language services.Dunlop 1988, p. 106. During the 1990s, a church museum was developed in a room in the western part of the church; this was refurbished in 2012. In 2013, Kirk o%27 Field Parish Church united with Greyfriars and the congregation re-adopted the name \\"Greyfriars Kirk\\". Since 2016, the Kirk o' Field buildings have been used by the church as the Greyfriars Charteris Centre. Setting and kirkyard A map of the historic development of the area around Greyfriars Greyfriars is set among Greyfriars Kirkyard, which is bounded to the north by the Grassmarket and to the east by Candlemaker Row. This is the same site given to the Observatine Franciscans during the reign of James I at the edge of the Old Town of Edinburgh. It was then a relatively open space: there were only two tenements at the eastern side of the grounds; now the north and east sides of the kirkyard are enclosed by buildings.Steele 1993, p. 5.Bryce 1912, p. 8. Prior to occupation by the friars, these lands had been owned by the family of the Tours of Inverleith since 1388; the friars' rights to the land were confirmed by James III in 1479.Bryce 1912, p. 9. The southern and western walls of the Friary's grounds were strengthened between 1513 and 1515 to create part of the Flodden Wall.Bryce 1912, p. 18. At the creation of the burial ground in 1562, a gate was installed at the site of the current north gate of the kirkyard. Since the construction of the Kirk, a causewayed path has connected this to the Kirk's north door.Bryce 1912, pp. 30, 42. The current gateway on Greyfriars Place opposite the junction of Candlemaker Row and George IV Bridge was added in 1624.Gray 1940, p. 33. Until 1591, burials were restricted to the northern half of the site; the Upper Yard, where the Kirk now stands, was held by the magistrates and wapinschaws were conducted there.Bryce 1912, pp. 30-31. ArchitectureDescription= The current church is rectangular in plan, consisting of a single nave of eight bays with aisles along the whole length of the church on either side. The church's architectural style can be described as \\"Survival Gothic\\" ‚Äì that is, Gothic architecture that continued after the Reformation ‚Äì fused with Baroque.Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 152. The exterior walls of the church consist of harled rubble with ashlar dressings. The church is 162 feet (49 meters) long by 72 feet (22 meters) wide. Externally, each bay is divided by buttresses, each of which is capped by a ball-topped obelisk finial. The buttresses at each corner of the church rest diagonally. The roof rises steeply above the aisles to a short course of wall, above which the roof over the nave continues at a shallower pitch.RCAHMS 1951, p. 47. Each bay, save the easternmost bays on either side and the westernmost on the south side, has a window. Most of these windows have been enlarged by lowering the sills, which, in three cases, has resulted in the removal of a doorway below. In the third bay from the east on the south side, the remains of the former south doorway are visible. The western three windows on the north side and the westernmost window of the south side are simple lancets with no tracery. All the windows of the western half of the church are clusters of lancet lights. The third window from the west on the south side holds three lights and intersecting tracery while, in the second window from the west on the same side, two lancet lights support a light in the shape of a mandorla. In each of the middle two bays of the north side stands a round-arched doorway with a sculpted angel's head on the keystone. Above the westernmost of these two sits a late-Gothic niche bracket bearing the arms of Edinburgh. These north doors are enclosed by a large, pedimented Palladian porch in channelled masonry of three bays and two storeys. The ground level is entered by round-headed arches while three rectangular windows illuminate the upper storey.Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 154. Internally, the upper storey of this porch contains two vestries accessed by a wooden turnpike stair. The east gable is surmounted by a Classical pediment whose ends and apex are topped by ball-topped obelisk finials. The pediment contains a small oculus. The main window is round-arched and consists of a cluster of five lancet lights while the lancet windows in the gable of either aisle hold three lancet lights. Between the apex of the central window and the pediment is a stone marked 1614, which shows the arms of Edinburgh. Below the central window stands the round-arched former doorway of the East church, now built-up. The west end of the church takes the form of a Dutch gable; the pediment is almost identical to that of the east gable while curving skews crown the gables of the aisles. The central section of the east gable is supported by buttresses, which reach to the foot of the pediment. The central window is a large lancet of three lights with intersecting tracery. The aisle gable windows hold two lights under \\"Y\\"-shaped tracery. Below the central window at the east end is a low, Renaissance-style semi-octagonal porch with a door in each of the three full faces and a pitched roof. The interior in the 21st century, showing the timber ceiling and reconstructed arcades added by Henry F. Kerr in 1932-38. Internally, octagonal pillars bear parallel arcades of chamfered pointed arches that run along eight bays; these are interrupted only by a lateral arch that divides the western two bays from the rest of the church. The aisles of these bays are partitioned off to form rooms and the arch frames the organ loft. In these two western bays, a plaster vault forms the ceiling while the eastern six bays are covered by a timber barrelled ceiling supported on timber shafts that rise from corbels in the wall above each pillar. A boss rests where each arch between corresponding shafts crosses the longitudinal rib; these depict emblems of Saint Andrew, Saint Margaret, and each person of the Trinity.Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 155.Steele 1993, p. 19. =Architectural history=The first church Work on the church had commenced by 1602, when Clement Russell is described as \\"maister of wark to the Kirk begun in the buriell plaice\\". In that year, the town council also ordered the removal of the buttresses and doors of the Convent of Catherine of Siena at Sciennes for use in the construction of the new church.Bryce 1912, p. 38.Hay 1957, p. 45. Work appears to have continued in 1603 and 1604, when Patrick Cochrane is referenced as master of works. Thereafter, work appears to have stopped until the town council moved to recommence work in 1611; but only in December 1612 did they order construction to \\"gang forward with all convenient expeditioun\\". A date stone on the east gable is marled 1614 the north east pillar, now replaced, was recorded to have been marked 1613: these suggest significant progress had been made by these dates; however, the church only opened in 1620.Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, pp. 152-154.Bryce 1912, p. 40. A detail of James Gordon of Rothiemay's map of 1647, showing Greyfriars Kirk as it appeared when first built. This is the only depiction of the church prior to the explosion of 1718. At its completion, the church consisted of an aisled nave of six bays with external buttresses; a squat, square-based tower at the west end; and a curvilinear gable at the east end. Doors stood in the north, south, and east walls and probably in the exterior wall of the tower.Hay 1957, p. 46. Internally, the octagonal pillars may have evoked similar pillars in St Giles'. There were originally galleries on the east, west, and probably north sides to face the pulpit, which stood against the middle south pillar. The church was damaged during its occupation by the English Army under Oliver Cromwell and subsequently repaired. Between 1656 and 1662 a lateral partition wall divided the interior. The galleries were expanded in 1696. Greyfriars was the first church built in Edinburgh since the Reformation and it was the largest post-Reformation church building in Scotland until well into the 18th century.RCAHMS 1951, pp. 45-46. According to George Hay, the form of an aisled nave, while \\"exceptional\\" in post-Reformation Scotland, did not represent a step back to pre-Reformation practices. The lack of a chancel reflected the communal emphasis of Reformed worship while the overall form was \\"the only formula then known in these islands for a large church\\".Hay 1957, pp. 28, 36.Steele 1993, pp. 5-6. Rebuilding after 1718 A view of Greyfriars from the west in 1829, showing the external appearance of the church between 1722 and 1845 On 2 May 1718, the gunpowder store on the third and fourth floors of the tower ignited. A contemporary record by the Kirk's Session Clerk describes the explosion as having \\"‚Ä¶Rent the Western Gevell of the Church, broke all the glass windows, and turned the Sclates of the Church, and broke a great deal of the Leadden high roof of the Church\\". The town council's first step was to enclose the eastern four bays with a wall in which stood a turnpike stair. Galleries were then added to make up for lost space; the former north door was moved one bay east and its keystone was adorned with a carving of an angel's head; plaster ceilings, coombed in the aisles and barrel-vaulted over the nave, were raised. In November 1719, the town council commissioned Alexander McGill to build a new church in the western half with Gilbert Smith as mason. McGill's plans effectively reversed the design of the existing church. The remains of the tower were demolished and two new bays were added to the west end of the damaged bays. This created spaces for two congregations: Old Greyfriars at the East and New Greyfriars at the West. Inside New Greyfriars, galleries on the north, south, and west sides faced a pulpit against the middle south pillar. McGill created a Dutch gable with Classical pediment at the western end and, below this, added the semi- octagonal porch. He also replicated the north door in the bay immediately west. McGill added a near-identical pediment over the east gable and topped the pediments and buttresses with ball-topped obelisk finials. In 1722, McGill added the Palladian north porch to enclose the north doors; he also recast the curvilinear east gable, adding a Classical pediment to replicate the one at the west end. Repairs after 1845 On the morning of Sunday, 19 January 1845, fire gutted Old Greyfriars, causing the partial collapse of the arcades and wrecking the furnishings of New Greyfriars. David Bryce designed new furnishings for New Greyfriars: a tall wainscot was installed and north, south, east galleries now faced a canopied pulpit at the west end. New Greyfriars re-opened in 1846. The restoration of Old Greyfriars took twelve years. Initially, James Smith was appointed architect but was responsible for little more than removing the roof and demolishing the remaining arcades. In 1856 and 1857, David Cousin radically rebuilt Old Greyfriars. In the windows, he inserted ashlar pierced by \\"Early English\\" lancet lights. He created a simple, triangular gable at the east end with a new lancet of three lights between the top of the central window and the apex of the gable. The arcades were not reconstructed, leaving an open interior covered by a single-span timber ceiling beneath a steeply pitched roof. In its time, Cousin's restoration of Old Greyfriars was \\"acclaimed as a sign that Presbyterianism had admitted Art as a handmaid of religion\\".Drummond 1934, p. 81. Around the time of the 1930s restoration, however, Andrew Landale Drummond would criticise the \\"effect of bleak though ornate ugliness\\".Drummond 1934, p. 82. A re-ordering of Old Greyfriars' interior was undertaken by Herbert Honeyman in 1912.Steele 1993, pp. 17-19. 1932 onwards The present appearance of the church dates from a restoration of 1932 to 1938 overseen by Henry F. Kerr. Kerr removed the partition wall to reunite the interior and reconstructed the arcade in the eastern four bays. He maintained the plaster vaulted ceiling over the two western bays and separated these from the rest of the church by a lateral arch.Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 155. Over the remaining six bays, he installed a barreled ceiling of California redwood.Dunlop 1988, p. 78. The woodwork of New Greyfriars was used to form a gallery under the western arch. In 1989, this was replaced by a new organ loft, accessed by a staircase made from redundant pitch pine pews.Gray 1940, p. 41. Kerr replaced David Cousin's pitched roof over Old Greyfriars with a two-stage roof in continuity with that over the western half of the church. He also recreated the pediment over the eastern gable. FeaturesStained glass= The windows of the eastern four bays of the church are the oldest stained glass windows in a Church of Scotland building: when they were added at the direction of Robert Lee in 1857, they were the first coloured windows in a Scottish parish church since the Reformation. These windows are effectively grisaille with abstract patterning except the east window, which also incorporates medallions depicting the Prodigal Son, the Wise and Foolish Virgins, the Good Samaritan, and the Pharisee and the Publican. Windows of this period commemorate John Erskine, Robert Traill, George Buchanan, William Robertson, and John Inglis. These windows were all executed by Ballantine and Allen except the Anderson memorial window in the north aisle, which is by Francis Barnett.Steele 1993, p. 21.Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 155. Further west along the south aisle, the Saint John the Baptist window was removed from Highland, Tolbooth, St John's in 1979. It had been presented there in 1945 by David Young Cameron to commemorate St John's Church. Next to this is a window by Marjorie Kemp in memory of Helen Pearl Gardiner; this depicts Saint Helen and Saint Margaret.Steele 1993, p. 22. The central window of the west end shows the morning of the Resurrection; it was executed by Ballantine and Gardiner in 1898.Steele 1993, p. 23. A millennium window depicting an abstract Celtic cross was designed by Douglas Hogg and added in 2000. =Organs= The pipe organ, built by Peter Collins and installed in 1989 The current three-manual organ stands at the west end of the church and was built by Peter Collins of Melton Mowbray in 1989.Steele 1993, p. 16. The organ possesses almost 3,400 pipes, which are arranged in towering cases with trumpets en chamade. Carved details on the cases by Derek Riley show Scottish plants and animals, a Franciscan Friar, and Greyfriars Bobby. Along the frieze of the towers runs the penultimate phrase of Psalm 150: \\"Laudate Dominum onme quod spirat\\" (\\"Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord\\"). A chamber organ stands in the north aisle: this was built around 1845 by David Hamilton of Edinburgh and purchased in 1968. The first organ in Greyfriars was a harmonium installed against the west wall of Old Greyfriars in 1863, during the ministry of Robert Lee. This was the first successful attempt to introduce an organ in a Church of Scotland building.Murray in Forrester and Murray 1984, p. 99. The harmonium was replaced in 1865 with a two-manual pipe organ by D. & T. Hamilton of Edinburgh. This was rebuilt and enlarged to three manuals in 1883 by Brindley & Foster of Sheffield. In 1932, after the union of Old and New Greyfriars, the organ was donated to St Columba's Church, Blackhall.Steele 1993, p. 15. In 1899, D. & T. Hamilton of Edinburgh installed a three-manual organ against the east wall of New Greyfriars. This had originally been made in 1866 by the same firm for Park Parish Church, Glasgow. It was overhauled in 1901 by Charles and Frederick Hamilton of Edinburgh. When the dividing wall between Old and New Greyfriars was removed in 1938, this organ was rebuilt in the north-west gallery by Gray & Davison of London. The console was placed at ground level under the opposite arcade until it was moved to the east end during the 1950s. It was overhauled again in 1960 by H. Hilsdon of Glasgow and scrapped in 1990 after its replacement by the current organ.Steele 1993, pp. 15-16. =Memorials= Margaret, Lady Yester, benefactor of Lady Yester%27s Kirk, is commemorated by a 17th century plaque on the south wall; this was removed from Lady Yester's Kirk after its union with Greyfriars in 1938. Next to this stands Lady Yester's headstone, which was discovered in 1951 during excavations in Tweeddale Court off the High Street.Steele 1993, p. 20.Dunlop 1988, p. 89. John Hutchison is responsible for the marble memorial to Robert Lee on the north wall (1870): this includes a relief portrait of Lee. Hutchison also executed a memorial plaque to William Robertson (1883). On the south wall, a stone tablet commemorates Robert Adam: this was installed in 1992 and was made to one of Adam's designs. Other individuals commemorated by plaques in Greyfriars include Thomas Ruddiman, Robert Wallace, and Alexander Nisbet, and Walter Scott.Steele 1993, pp. 20-21. =Furnishings= The dais and oak wainscot and communion table at the east end of the church were added in 1912 to designs of Herbert Honeyman. The table is decorated with bronze panels that show the symbols of the four Evangelists and an Evangelist at work. The wainscot, whose Canopy incorporates depictions of the wounds of Christ, was adorned by the addition of gilt cross to the central panel in 1963: this was donated by City of Edinburgh (Fortress) Royal Engineers. The communion table and wainscot were altered in 1971 by George Hay.Steele 1993, pp. 17-18. Herbert Honeyman designed the Jacobean-style canopied pulpit: its back panel bears the arms of Scotland, Edinburgh, and the University of Edinburgh. In 1951, George Hay altered the pulpit and moved it from the first pillar pillar on the south side to the third: this places it in the same position as the first pulpit of the church. The church also possesses brass and oak eagle lecterns; the latter dates to 1893 and came from Lady Yester%27s Kirk. The font was brought from Rome in 1912 by William Moir Bryce; it likely dates from the early Renaissance.Steele 1993, p. 18. The communion table of the New North Church stands at the east end of the north aisle while the communion table of New Greyfriars stands at the east end of the south aisle. The furnishings in the western part of the south aisle were moved from the St John's Chapel of Highland, Tolbooth, St John's.Steele 1993, p. 20. Pitch pine pews added to the nave during Henry F. Kerr's restoration of 1932-1938 were replaced by chairs in 1989. =Bells, plate, and artefacts= The bell of Greyfriars hangs in a bracketed wooden shelter on the exterior of the north porch. The bell was made in the 1860s for St Paul's Church, Waterhouses, County Durham and donated to Greyfriars in 1991 by Nancy Bryson. From 1640, the bell of the Magdalen Chapel tolled to announce services at Greyfriars. The first bell of Greyfriars was installed taken from the Tron Kirk in 1684 and installed in the west tower. This was removed in 1690 and replaced by a bell made in 1691 by Edinburgh‚Äôs Meikle family of founders. This bell was destroyed along with the west tower in the explosion of 1718.Bryce 1912, pp. 90-91, 119-120, 135. Plate in possession Greyfriars includes four communion cups, two dated 1633 and two dated 1644, as well as four cups donated to Lady Yester%27s Kirk by the minister, Thomas Wilkie, in 1708 and, from Old Greyfriars, a laver and baptismal basin, made 1649 and renewed 1707. Embossed pewter alms dishes of 1703 and 1711 also came from Lady Yester's; the church possesses another pewter alms dish of 1733 from Greyfriars along with pewter plates and flagons. The church possess two silver cups dated 1642 and two dated 1643 as well as cups dated 1775 from the Highland congregation and plates of 1717 from the Tolbooth Kirk.Dunlop 1988, p. 77. Historic items on display in Greyfriars include an original copy of the National Covenant, Robert Traill's sword, and an 1867 portrait of Greyfriars Bobby by John Macleod. A U.S. flag hangs in the north aisle: this was given by the Consul General of the United States of America in 1970 to commemorate the 350th anniversaries of both the landing of the Pilgrims at Plymouth Rock and the opening of Greyfriars. MinistryMinisters and elders= Robert Lee, who pioneered a number of liturgical reforms while minister of Old Greyfriars. Richard Frazer has been minister of Greyfriars since 2003. He was ordained as a minister in 1986 and previously served as minister of St Machar's Cathedral, Old Aberdeen. Both Old and New Greyfriars were burgh churches: this meant the town council held the right to nominate the churches' ministers until the abolition of patronage within the Church of Scotland in 1874.Dunlop 1988, pp. 24-27. The first ministers of the South-West Parish, which became Old Greyfriars, were Robert Rollock and Peter Hewat.Scott 1915, p. 37. The charge of Greyfriars continued with two ministers until 1840, when St John's Church, Victoria Street, was erected and the last minister of the second charge, Thomas Guthrie became the first minister of the new church.Scott 1915, p. 44. New Greyfriars was, from its establishment in 1722, served by one minister. The town council often appointed promising ministers to New Greyfriars on the understanding that they would be promoted to one of the city's two-charge churches soon afterwards. For this reason, many ministers of New Greyfriars served relatively short incumbencies. In 1929, William Wallace Dunlop Gardiner, the last minister of New Greyfriars, became the first minister of the united charge of Greyfriars. Three ministers of Old Greyfriars were elected moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland during their incumbencies: George Kay in 1755,Scott 1915, p. 47. William Robertson in 1763,Scott 1915, p. 41. John Inglis in 1804.Scott, 1915, p. 42. Two ministers of New Greyfriars were elected to this role during their incumbencies: Robert Henry in 1774Scott 1915, p. 34. and James Nicoll Ogilvie in 1918.Dunlop 1988, p. 87<. In 2003, Alison Elliot, an elder of Greyfriars, was elected to serve as moderator of the 2004 General Assembly. Elliot was the first woman moderator and the first lay person to hold the office since George Buchanan in 1567. Other notable ministers of Greyfriars include the Covenanters, Robert Douglas, Robert Traill, and Gilbert Rule;Scott 1915, pp. 38-39. the statesman, William Carstares;Scott 1915, p. 46. the philanthropist, Thomas Guthrie;Scott 1915, p. 48. and the liturgical reformer, Robert Lee.Scott 1915, p. 43. =Mission= Since 2016, the congregation has operated the Greyfriars Charteris Centre in the former Kirk o' Field Parish Church Since the 18th century, the congregations of Greyfriars have maintained missions, church centres, and projects outwith the main church building. New Greyfriars was especially active in mission work, using the Gaelic Chapel in Castle Wynd and, in 1846, founding the Vennel Ragged School: one of the first of its kind in Edinburgh. In 1886, the congregation built the Robertson Memorial Mission in the Grassmarket.Dunlop 1988, p. 85. From 1835, Old Greyfriars rented the Magdalen Chapel as a preaching station to the poor of the Cowgate.Dunlop 1988, p. 79. Since 1982, the congregation has worked with the Grassmarket Mission. Together, they have developed the Grassmarket Community Project, which offers community and training to homeless people and individuals with physical and mental health needs. Since 2016, Greyfriars Kirk has operated the Greyfriars Charteris Centre in the former buildings of Kirk o' Field Parish Church and the St Ninian's Centre on the Pleasance. The centre, named for Archibald Charteris, offers halls for the use the of local community. In 2002, Greyfriars Kirk, Augustine United Church (United Reformed), and St Columba's-by-the-Castle (Episcopal) committed \\"to work together to establish a united and positive Christian presence in the centre of Edinburgh\\". In 2006, this grouping was recognised as a Local Ecumenical Partnership by the Scottish Churches National Sponsoring Body. The congregations engage in joint services during Holy Week; the congregations are also members of Action of Churches Together in Scotland and Edinburgh Churches Together. The minister of Greyfriars is a member of the chaplaincy team of the University of Edinburgh. The church also hosts services and events in co- operation with the university chaplaincy. =Worship and choir= Greyfriars' main weekly services takes place at 11 a.m. every Sunday. Communion is held monthly and a prayer service is held every Thursday at 1.10 p.m. Greyfriars played a leading role in the development of liturgy in the Church of Scotland: during the ministry of Robert Lee in Old Greyfriars, practices such as standing for praise, the use of prepared prayers, kneeling for prayer, and the playing of a harmonium to accompany praise.Murray in Forrester and Murray 1984, pp. 91-92, 99. Lee's innovations led to the foundation of the Church Service Society, whose library is kept in Greyfriars.Maxwell 1958, p. 176. Greyfriars' mixed, non-professional choir sings at the 11 a.m. Sunday services and at special services throughout the year. The choir is led by choirmaster and organist, Henry Wallace. The tradition of choral music at Greyfriars began in 1865, when Joseph Geoghegan, musical director between 1857 and 1883, founded Greyfriars Choral Society.Bryce 1912, p. 150. Gaelic worship A Gaelic language service is held every Sunday in Greyfriars at 12.30 p.m. in the St John's Aisle. Since the death of the Reverend Ewen Maclean in 2000, an ecumenical roster of ministers and preachers have led services; worship also features the unaccompanied singing of the Psalms. The church also hosts the annual Highland lecture on Gaelic subjects and, during the General Assembly, a Gaelic service. Gaelic services have been held in Greyfriars since 1979, when the congregation united with Highland, Tolbooth, St John's. Gaelic worship in Edinburgh began in 1704, when the General Assembly made provision for Gaelic- speaking soldiers stationed in Edinburgh Castle. The first Gaelic chapel opened on Castle Wynd in 1769; the congregation united with its own chapel of ease in Horse Wynd (now Chambers Street) in 1815 and became a parish quoad sacra in 1834. In 1875, the congregation, by then known as St Oran's, moved to the former Catholic Apostolic Church in Broughton. The congregation moved again in 1948, when it united with St Columba's ‚Äì which had been founded as a congregation of the Free Church in 1843 ‚Äì based on Cambridge Street in Tollcross. In 1956, the congregation united with Tolbooth St John's.Dunlop 1988, pp. 101-102.

He represented India in eight Test matches as a medium pace bowler who could swing the ball and was a useful batsman.  Career  A late starter in cricket, Sandhu's break came when he was spotted during a summer coaching camp by the former first class cricketer Yeshwant 'Baba' Sidhaye. Next year, he came under the influence of the famous coach Ramakant Achrekar and later the Ranji player Hemu Dalvi. Sandhu's chance in first class cricket came in 1980-81 when Karsan Ghavri, the regular opening bowler for Bombay, was away with the national side. Sandhu did not play in the first two matches of the season but then his debut against Gujarat where he claimed nine wickets. He was not part of the side to play in the final against Delhi that season, but was included at the last moment when the originally chosen Ravi Kulkarni dropped out. In a sensational spell, he reduced Delhi to 18-5 on the first morning and finished with nine wickets in the match. His 25 wickets in the season came at an average of 18.72. Early in the 1982-83 season, in the Duleep Trophy match for West Zone against South he took eight wickets and scored 56 while batting at No.11. Another five wicket haul in the Irani Trophy put him in the Indian team that toured Pakistan. Following a heel bone injury to Madan Lal, Sandhu made his debut in the fourth Test at Hyderabad. His first two wickets came off successive balls when he dismissed Mohsin Khan and Haroon Rashid. Those were India's only successes for a long time as Javed Miandad and Mudassar Nazar then went about setting a world record partnership. Sandhu scored 71 quick runs batting at No.9. He scored 68 in the first innings at Bridgetown against West Indies following an Indian collapse. In the next Test, his opening spell reduced West Indies to three down for one run. Sandhu played a significant role in the Indian team that won the 1983 World Cup. Batting at No.11 in the final, he put on 22 runs with Syed Kirmani during which he was hit on his head by a bouncer. Later he famously clean bowled Gordon Greenidge with a huge inswinger to which the batsman had shouldered arms. That was the third time within 3 months he dismissed Greenidge. He further dismissed Greenidge for the fourth time in 1983 tour match between West Zone and West Indies. His last Test was also against West Indies later that year at Ahmedabad. He took a single wicket in that match, which was the only that was missed by Kapil Dev who took 9 for 83 in the same innings. Thereafter he did little in any form of cricket. His 98 against Tamil Nadu was important in Bombay taking the first innings lead in the Ranji semifinal of 1984-85. He served as the coach of Mumbai and Punjab, and worked with the National Cricket Academy. In the 1990s he played club cricket in Kenya and did some coaching there. He was associated with the Indian Cricket League (ICL) for some time. He lives at Neelkanth Gardens in Govandi near Chembur, Mumbai. He has two daughters.

It is used to perform many types of exercises, including ballistic exercises that combine cardiovascular, strength and flexibility training. They are also the primary equipment used in the weight lifting sport of kettlebell lifting. History Arthur Saxon with a kettlebell, cover of The Text Book of Weight-Lifting (1910) The Russian girya (, plural ) was a type of metal weight, primarily used to weigh crops in the 18th century. The use of such weights by circus strongmen is recorded for the 19th century. They began to be used for recreational and competition strength athletics in Russia and Europe in the late 19th century. The birth of competitive kettlebell lifting or girevoy sport (–≥–∏—Ä–µ–≤–æ–π —Å–ø–æ—Ä—Ç) is dated to 1885, with the founding of the \\"Circle for Amateur Athletics\\" (–ö—Ä—É–∂–æ–∫ –ª—é–±–∏—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π –∞—Ç–ª–µ—Ç–∏–∫–∏).–ú–∞—Ä–∏—è –°–æ–∫–æ–ª–æ–≤–∞, –î–≤–∞ ¬´–±—É–ª—å–¥–æ–≥–∞¬ª –Ω–∞ –≥—Ä—É–¥—å. –ö–∞–∫ –¥–æ–∫—Ç–æ—Ä –ö—Ä–∞–µ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π —Å—Ç–∞–ª ¬´–æ—Ç—Ü–æ–º —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–π –∞—Ç–ª–µ—Ç–∏–∫–∏¬ª \\"–ê—Ä–≥—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç—ã –∏ –§–∞–∫—Ç—ã\\", 22 August 2016 (with period photographs). Russian are traditionally measured in weight by pood, corresponding to . The English term kettle bell has been in use since the early 20th century.Advertised by A.P. Schmidt in Physical Culture vol. 21 (1908), p. 505: \\"PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD ARE USING SCHMIDT'S Celebrated 'MONARCH' DUMB-BELL, BAR BELL AND KETTLE BELL SYSTEM\\"; also spelled KETTLE-BELLS (with hyphen) in a 1910 advertisement for the \\"Automatic Exerciser\\") Similar weights used in Classical Greece were the haltere, comparable to the modern kettlebell in terms of movements. Shape 12 kg, 16 kg, and 24 kg kettlebells Unlike traditional dumbbells, a kettlebell's center of mass is extended beyond the hand, similar to Indian clubs or ishi sashi. This facilitates ballistic and swinging movements. Variants of the kettlebell include bags filled with sand, water, or steel shot. The kettlebell allows for swing movements and release moves with added safety and added grip, wrist, arm and core strengthening. The weight of a kettlebell is not distributed evenly. Thus, the unique shape of a kettlebell provides the \\"unstable force\\" for handling \\\\- key for the effectiveness of the kettlebell exercises.Liebenson, Craig \\"Functional Training with the Kettlebell.\\" Journal of Bodywork & Movement Therapies 15 (2011): 542-544 Parts of a competition kettlebell The parts of the kettlebell can be broken down into: handle, corners, horns, window, bell, and base. Exercise By their nature, typical kettlebell exercises build strength and endurance, particularly in the lower back, legs, and shoulders, and increase grip strength. The basic movements, such as the swing, snatch, and the clean and jerk, engage the entire body at once, and in a way that mimics real world activities such as shoveling or farm work. Unlike the exercises with dumbbells or barbells, kettlebell exercises involve large numbers of repetitions in the sport, and can also involve large reps in normal training. Kettlebell exercises are in their nature holistic; therefore they work several muscles simultaneously and may be repeated continuously for several minutes or with short breaks. This combination makes the exercise partially aerobic and more similar to high-intensity interval training rather than to traditional weight lifting. In a 2010 study, kettlebell enthusiasts performing a 20-minute snatch workout were measured to burn, on average, 13.6 calories/minute aerobically and 6.6 calories/minute anaerobically during the entire workout - \\"equivalent to running a 6-minute mile pace\\".Porcari et al. (2010), University of Wisconsin. When training with high repetitions, kettlebell progression should start out slowly to build muscle endurance, support the joints and prevent injury. Like movements performed with any exercise tool, they can be dangerous to those who have back or shoulder problems, or a weak core, when performed without proper education and progression. However, if done properly, they are very beneficial to health. They can offer improved mobility, range of motion, agility, cardio vascular endurance, mental toughness and increased strength. Exercises The following is a list of common exercises that are uniquely suited to the kettlebell for one reason or another. =Using one kettlebell= Turkish get-up * American swing. Also called the overhead swing, this swing variation ends with the kettlebell directly overhead instead of at chest level. * Turkish get-up. A kettlebell exercise that combines the lunge, bridge and side plank in a slow, controlled movement. Keeping the arm holding the bell extended vertically, the athlete transitions from lying supine on the floor to standing, and back again. Get-ups are sometimes modified into get-up presses, with a press at each position of the get-up; that is, the athlete performs a floor press, a leaning seated press, a high bridge press, a single- leg kneeling press, and a standing press in the course of a single get- up.Liebenson, Craig and Shaughness, Gabrielle \\"The Turkish Get-up.\\" Journal of Bodywork & Movement Therapies 15 (2011): 125-127 * Halo. The kettlebell is held by the horns in front of the shoulders, usually upside-down, and moved in a circle around the head while keeping the head straight in place. This movement is done to improve mobility of the shoulders and triceps. * Arm bar. As with the other slow exercises (the windmill, get-up, and halo), this drill improves shoulder mobility and stabilization. It starts lying on the ground with the kettlebell over the shoulder in a straight arm position, as in the top of a floor press, but with the other arm along the floor straight overhead. The trainee then gradually turns their body away from the kettlebell until they are lying partially on their front. * Slingshot. The kettlebell is held hanging in one arm and moved smoothly around the body, switching hands in front and behind. In the figure-8 slingshot, the trainee moves the bell in a figure-8 through the legs while in a partial squat; a wider variation of this exercise is the cossack slingshot. * Slingshot lunge. Also called a front leg pass, this is a backward lunge, circling the bell around the front leg, returning to the standing position, and repeating. * Circular swing. Like the slingshot, but the bell is swung forward until the arms are parallel to the ground. * Figure-8 swing. Like a 1-arm swing, but the bell goes down on one side of the body, switching hands and up through the legs, and then down the other side. * Circular clean. Starting with the bell in the rack, the bell is pushed away to the side slightly, the swung down to the other side in front of the body, and reversed back up into the rack. * Deck squat. The kettlebell is held in two hands by the ball instead of the handle. The trainee squats down deeply, then rocks back on their back and lowers the bell overhead so that the handle touches the ground, before reverse the movement and standing back up. * Helping hand press. A variation of the press where the other arm assists by pushing open palm against the ball. * Isometric holds. Stand on one leg and hold the kettle bell with the opposite arm. By then lowering and raising the kettlebell you can work stabilization and power. * Bent press. A press utilizing a bent-leg windmill position to lift heavier weight than is otherwise possible. * Arm bar floor press. A floor press in the arm bar or partial arm bar position. * Russian twist. While seated the trainee leans back to around 45 degrees and balances with the knees held at 90 degrees from the torso. The bell is held by the horns and moved from side to side of the torso. =Using two kettlebells= The following movements can be done with two kettlebells: * Renegade row: Also called a plank row, the trainee starts in the plank position holding the handles of two grounded kettlebells. One bell is rowed to the chest while maintaining the plank position, then returned to the ground and repeated with the other arm. Alternatively performed with a single kettlebell, one arm at a time. * Alternating clean: A clean is performed with one arm while the other kettlebell is kept in the rack position, then repeated with the other arm. AKA gorilla cleans. * Pushup: Starting in the plank position holding the handles of two grounded kettlebells, the trainee performs a pushup. This requires more control than an ordinary pushup and results in a greater range of motion. This is often combined with the renegade row. Feet may be elevated to increase the difficulty, until the trainee is performing a handstand push-up on the kettlebells. * Carry: Walking with two kettlebells held in various positions, such as waiter (one arm overhead, one arm rack, either hand or both with waiter hold) or cross (one arm overhead, one arm suitcase). For some exercises, multiple kettlebells can be held in the same hand, for trainees lacking sufficiently heavy kettlebells. In any movement involving the rack or overhead position, the kettlebell can be held with the ball in an open palm (sometimes called the waiter hold) for a greater stabilisation challenge, or for even more precise control and added grip challenge, the bottom-up hold, squeezing the kettlebell by the handle upside-down. This is especially useful for training to stay tight while pressing. Holding a single kettlebell in the rack position bottom-up with two hands (\\"by the horns\\") makes for goblet exercise variants. =Using one or two kettlebells= * Conventional swing: The kettlebell is swung from just below the groin to somewhere between the upper abdomen and shoulders, with arms straight or slightly bent, the degree of flexion depends on the trajectory of the kettlebell. * High pull: A swing variation where the kettlebell is thrust a little higher than the Russian swing, and at the apex the bell is pulled in towards the shoulder, and then pushed out again and back down into the swing. Sometimes the \\"high pull\\" instead refers to a deadlift that continues into a pull straight up to shoulder level. * Hang clean: The kettlebell is held in the rack position (resting on the forearm in the crook of the elbow, with the elbow against the chest), lowered to below the knees, and then thrust back up in to the rack. * Swing clean: The kettlebell is held in the rack position, dropped into the back-swing behind the knees, and then back up in to the rack via the up-swing. The clean is often combined with a press or jerk to make a clean and press or a clean & jerk (also called a long jerk). This is the most common clean, hence, it's referred to as 'clean' rather than 'swing clean'. * Dead clean: The kettlebell is pulled up dead from the ground, straight into rack position. * Snatch: There are two styles of snatch, Hardstyle Snatch and Kettlebell Sport Snatch. The kettlebell is held in one hand, lowered to behind the knees via hip hinge, swung to an overhead position and held stable, before repeating the movement. The dead snatch or true snatch begins with the bell on the ground. The lunge snatch lowers into a lunge while the bell goes to the overhead position. * Strict press: Also called the military press or standing press, the kettlebell is held in the rack position and pushed overhead with one arm, keeping the body rigid. The tree press, a press standing on one leg, performs a similar function. Other variations include the walking press, taking a step forward with each press, perhaps alternating hands, and the seated press, where the trainee sits on the ground with straight legs while pressing overhead. * Floor press: A press performed lying on the ground. A variation is the bridge press, a press in the wrestler's bridge position. * Push press: As a strict press, but with a single dip of the hips to provide assistance. * Jerk: As a push press, but with two dips, for more leg assistance (as in the barbell clean and jerk) * Thruster: A rack squat with a press at the top using momentum from the squat. * Squat: The basic squat is performed holding one or more kettlebells in the rack position, or a single a bell in the goblet position, which can help develop hip mobility by using the elbows to push the knees out at the bottom of the squat. * Overhead squat: A squat with the kettlebell held overhead, requiring good hip and shoulder mobility. * Sots press: Named after world record olympic weightlifter Viktor Sots, also called the squat press, this exercise is a rack squat with a press at the bottom of the squat. * Lunge press: Sometimes called the tactical lunge, this is a press from a lunging position. * Pistol squat: A single-leg squat with one leg held straight in front parallel to the ground, holding the bell in the goblet or rack position. An easier variant for those with less hip mobility is to perform the squat parallel to a step or ledge, so that the foot of the free leg can dip beneath the pushing leg at the bottom. * Deadlift: Can be performed different styles, sumo, squat or hip hinge, with one or more kettlebells between the legs, it can also be performed with the kettlebells on the outside (suitcase). Deadlifts can also be performed with one-arm, one-leg, or both. * Carry: Walking with the kettlebell held in various positions, such as suitcase, rack, goblet, or overhead. * Row: While bent over anywhere from 45 degrees to parallel with the ground, the kettlebell is held hanging from a straight arm, pulled up to the hips or laterally, and lowered again. * Lunge: A lunge performed with the kettlebell held in either the hanging, racked, overhead or mixed position. * Lateral lunge: A lateral lunge with the bell in either the racked or overhead positions. The deepest form of this is called the cossack squat. * Lateral lunge clean: A clean performed along with a lateral lunge. * Squat Get-up: A variation of the Turkish get-up where the feet are pulled into the buttocks to get up squat style. * Windmill: Standing with a bell held overhead, the hips are pushed to the side of the bell. Keeping the bell arm vertical, the upper body is bent to one side and rotated until the other hand is touching the floor. This improves mobility and stability through the hips and shoulder. Alternatively the bell may be held in the other hand, or with one in each hand. An easier version is the bent-leg windmill where the off-side leg is bent, or the supported windmill where the free hand rests against the off leg. * Farmer's Walk: Walking holding kettlebells at your sides. The single kettlebell version is called the suitcase walk. These build grip strength while challenging your core, hips, back and traps.  Kettlebell swing  Video of kettlebell swing, hip hinge style The kettlebell swing (also the Russian swing, double-arm swing or conventional kettlebell swing) is a basic ballistic exercise used to train the posterior chain in a manner similar to broad jumping. The kettlebell is swung from just below the groin to somewhere between the upper abdomen and shoulders, with arms straight or slightly bent, the degree of flexion depends on the trajectory of the kettlebell. The key to a good kettlebell swing is effectively thrusting the hips, not bending too much at the knees, and sending the weight forwards, as opposed to squatting the weight up, or lifting up with the arms. Some knee flexion (a squat) is commonly employed during the swing, although there is some controversy as to whether a swing can or should be performed with just a hip hinge instead. This exercise requires an intense contraction of the gluteal, abdominal and latissimus muscles. = Variations = The swing can also be performed with a release and catch of the kettlebell, which helps train the proper swing pattern where the arms aren't pulling up at the top. This can be done with two hands switching to a supinated catch. The one-arm swing presents a significant anti-twisting challenge, and can be used with an alternating catch switching between arms. Further variations include the walking swing taking a step forward at the apex of each swing, the outside swing where the kettlebell swings outside the leg, and the kneeling swing, swinging between the legs in a one-leg half-kneeling position. There are many variations of the kettlebell swing, some are, but not limited to: single-arm swing, one kettlebell double arm swing, two kettlebells double arm swing, suitcase swing, swing squat style, high swing. Within those variations there are plenty more variations, some are, but not limited to: pace, movement, speed, power, grip, the direction of thumb, elbow flexion, knee flexion.  Grips  The kettlebell has more than 25 grips that can employed, to provide variety, challenge different muscles, increase or decrease complexity, and work on proprioception. Some of the grip categories are, but not limited to: pressing grips, racking grips, lifting grips, ballistic grips, juggling grips, isometric hold grips. Lifting styles jerk with 32 kg kettlebells (rack position). Contemporary kettlebell training is represented basically by five styles. Hardstyle has its roots in powerlifting and G≈çj≈´-ry≈´ karate training, particularly hojo und≈ç concepts. With emphasis on the \\"hard\\" component and borrowing the concept of kime, the Hardstyle focuses on strength and power and duality of relaxation and tension. Girevoy, sometimes referred to as the fluid style in comparison to the Hardstyle, represents the training regimen for the competitive sport of kettlebell lifting, focusing on strength endurance. Crossfit kettlebell refers to implementation of kettlebell training as in CrossFit curricula, often with significant modifications to preceding styles (e.g. American Swing vs. conventional swing, placing the kettlebell down between snatches).Hardstyle, Girevoy, or CrossFit? How to Decide Which Kettlebell Style Is Best Juggling is a training style where the practitioner releases and catches the kettlebell with all manner of spins and flips around the body.How to Get Started with Kettlebell Juggling Kettlebell training is all that is done with a kettlebell outside of the above 4 categories. Kettlebell training is extremely broad and caters to many different goals, some being, but not limited to: mobility, flexibility, cardiovascular endurance, strength, speed and power. If an athlete is training in the gym, on the beach, or in the park, and not performing any of the above disciplines, they are participating in kettlebell training.  Kettlebell sport  The kettlebell sport in Russia is where the main popularity of the kettlebell started, from there it was brought to the United States by Pavel Tsatsouline and has developed into much more than just kettlebell lifting competitively. The sport can be compared to what the CrossFit Games is to CrossFit, however, the sport has been much longer in existence, and is only recently gaining more popularity worldwide, with women participating as well. One such example being Valerie Pawlowski, who at age 52, was the first US female lifter in the veteran age category to achieve Master of Sport in 24 kg Kettlebell Long Cycle.

Digital image processing is the most common technique today, although sometimes artists' drawings are used. Age progression is most often used as a forensics tool by law enforcement. It can be used to show the likely current appearance of a missing person from a photograph many years old. Age progression is often used with missing people who have not been seen for several years, such as Tammie Wilkinson. Other meanings Age progression may also refer to several loosely related types of transformation, often shortened to AP, in which a character suddenly increases in age. The two main categories are child to adult transformation, and young adult into old age. Some overlap is possible; a child may become an adult, and then continue to old age. =Age progression in media= Age progression is an occasional theme in anime/manga, motion pictures, cartoons and comics, literature, and stage performances. One of the earliest mentions is the Athena origin legend, who leaped from Zeus's skull fully grown. The protagonist of the Vietnamese Giong legend grew up rapidly. =Literature= *A classic work where age progression is thwarted rather than accelerated, is Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray; at the end of the story, the protagonist undergoes AP after killing his likeness in a painting, which had previously preserved Gray's youthful appearance. *In the book \\"Happy Birthday, Dear Amy\\" by Marilyn Kaye, a 13-year-old girl grows into a 25-year- old overnight. =Japanese media= Age progressions are a common theme in Japanese anime and manga. Many anime series feature girls transforming into often voluptuous women. They go through elaborate transformation sequences, in which their clothes are magically replaced with costumes, and their bodies are hidden by energy streamers. The transformation scene may be reused in each episode, emphasizing the characters' breasts and hips growing in a comical way. They may be shown blushing afterward. The earliest known case is the anime/manga series Marvelous Melmo by Osamu Tezuka. In each episode, the young girl Melmo has to help people by impersonating adult professions, like a stewardess or a policewoman. The plot was imitated in later series such as Minky Momo and Fancy Lala. Age progression is a popular theme in hentai manga. There are also many stories in which a character gets younger (age regression). =Motion pictures= *Film in which boys physically become men: **Big **Vice Versa (1948) **Vice Versa (1988) **14 Going on 30 (1988 Disney movie) **Conan The Barbarian\\" **Wait 'til You're Older **The Thief Lord *Body swap film in which young girls' souls end up in the bodies of older women.

Born in Hereford, the eldest child of Francis and Mary Marshall Ward, Harry Ward was educated at Lincoln Cathedral school. from c. 1864. He went on to scientific studies at the South Kensington Science and Art Department under Thomas Henry Huxley in 1874. Ward then attended first Owens College, Manchester, in 1875, and subsequently Christ's College, Cambridge, from 1876 to 1879. At Cambridge, Ward achieved a B.A. with First Class honours in the Natural Sciences Tripos. Ward's education at Cambridge was funded by a wealthy fellow student from South Kensington, Louis Lucas. He also studied with leading German botanists Julius von Sachs and Anton de Bary who at the time were way ahead of the English in the field of experimental botany. From early 1880 until 1882, Ward was employed by the British government in Ceylon (modern Sri Lanka) to study the coffee rust disease affecting the island's coffee plantations. His detailed and methodical work established his reputation as a plant pathologist and physiologist and although he was unable to stop the rust in the coffee plantations of Ceylon he laid the foundations for solving the problem in the future. Ward recommended avoiding monoculture, and the cultivation of multiple strains of coffee. Ward demonstrated that disease spores could be spread on the wind and recommended growing trees between plantations to reduce this. However plantation owners in Ceylon had already destroyed many indigenous species on their plantations and planted a single type of coffee on almost every available acre. In 1883 Ward returned to Owens College as an assistant lecturer, and married his very patient fianc√©e Selina Mary Kingdon, who had been waiting for him since around 1870. Their first child was a daughter Winifred Mary Ward born October 1884, and on 6 November 1885 they had a son Francis Kingdon Ward. In 1885 shortly after the birth of his son he was appointed Professor of botany at the Royal Indian engineering college (Forestry department) at Cooper's hill, now part of Brunel University. He moved with his new family into a house at Englefield Green. He became F.L.S. (Fellow of the Linnaean Society) in 1886 F.R.H.S. ([Fellow of the Royal Horticultural Society in 1887 and F.R.S. (Fellow of the Royal Society) in 1889. He was president of the British Mycological Society in 1900 and 1901. A great deal of his work and study was influenced by one of his early tutors, W.T. Thiselton-Dyer. It was Thiselton Dyer who suggested him for the job in Ceylon, he who largely got him his first post at Owen's College. Dyer persuaded him to spend time researching the biological processes involved in brewing ginger beer, and helped ensure his entry to the Linnaean society, his signature was on a letter to the prime minister of the day H. H. Asquith recommending a pension should be paid to his widow, Selina after his death. In 1895 he became Professor of Botany at Cambridge University, his alma mater. There was a tremendous amount of work to do with the department which had been neglected by previous incumbents. Ward worked tirelessly to get the teaching and the facilities up to scratch. His efforts culminated in a complete new building designed and equipped to his own requirements. The building was opened on 1 March 1904 by King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra. There was a seven course lunch for the King and Queen and a select guest list included Thiselton Dyer. Meanwhile, he was gaining more honours and positions on committees while still researching, teaching, and administrating. All this work took its toll on his health. He was weakened further by diabetes. He died on 26 August 1906 aged only 52. He is buried in the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge, with his wife; his friend Sir Francis Darwin is also buried there.

The station is on the East Coast Main Line, east of Edinburgh Waverley, and is served by stopping passenger trains on the North Berwick Line. History The main line between Edinburgh and Berwick-upon-Tweed was opened by the North British Railway on 22 June 1846, with Longniddry station and the branch line to Haddington opening on the same date. Longniddry's importance as a junction station increased in 1898 with the opening of the Gullane branch. There were originally three platforms, the Up (eastbound) platform with the main station building, and an island platform serving the Down (westbound) main line and the Haddington branch, which diverged immediately to the east of the station and ran parallel to the main lines for some distance before curving off to the south on an embankment. The branch was originally built as double track, but was singled in 1856. Between the Down line and the Haddington branch east of the station were two long trailing sidings known as Blawearie Sidings which were used for storing rolling stock. On the south side of the branch was a two road engine shed and the Harelaw Lime Works siding. On the Up side, east of the station, was the goods yard containing a goods shed and three trailing sidings. At the west end of the station the branch platform line continued as a 160-yard siding (headshunt) on the Down side, whilst further west was a short trailing siding on the Up side, known as Longniddry West Siding. The latter was also known as 'Manure Siding' or 'the dung lye', as it was used to receive wagons loaded with horse dung collected from the streets of Edinburgh and sent to Longniddry for sale as agricultural fertiliser. Longniddry signal box was located at the east end of the Down platform. The junction of the Gullane branch was at Spittal (Aberlady Junction), 1.5 miles to the east. Retrenchment during the Twentieth Century saw passenger services withdrawn from the Gullane and Haddington branch lines on 12 September 1932 and 5 December 1949 respectively. On 15 June 1964 the Gullane branch closed to all traffic, followed by closure of Longniddry goods yard on 28 December 1964 and the Haddington branch on 30 March 1968. The locomotive shed had closed in 1964, and following the demise of the Haddington branch the signal box was closed on 8 September 1968 and all sidings removed. The former goods yard site was redeveloped as the new station car park, while the waiting rooms and canopy on the Down platform were removed in the late 1960s and replaced with bus-stop type shelters. Closure of the North Berwick branch and of Drem, Longniddry and Prestonpans stations was proposed in 1969, but not approved by the Minister of Transport. Nonetheless, stopping passenger services were drastically reduced from 1970, and their future was again in doubt following the publication of the Serpell Report in 1982. However, the number of local trains had gradually recovered from the low of the 1970s and by the end of the 1980s the service was once again hourly. 'Pay train' operation began east of Edinburgh on 27 May 1985, at which point the station became unstaffed. The main station building and ticket office (a single storey stone building with a flat-roofed extension) was demolished in 1986/87, at which time the platforms were extended to the east and cut back at the western ends, and the station footbridge was replaced. This work was a prelude to electrification of the East Coast Main Line by British Rail, with most North Berwick line trains being electrically powered from 8 July 1991. One minor landmark of which little is known save for its ingenuity and efficiency was a mailbag switch device still in use in the 1970s. It was located on the trackside some west of the station, and mailbags previously loaded on the device's arm could be captured at speed by a matching mechanism on passing southbound express trains which therefore did not need to stop.  Services  All trains calling at Longniddry are operated by Abellio ScotRail. Long-distance passenger trains operated by CrossCountry and London North Eastern Railway pass through Longniddry non-stop, as do freight trains. = 2007/08 = * Monday - Friday - Hourly from Edinburgh to North Berwick and return, with a half-hour frequency at peak times.

A diesel motorcycle is a motorcycle with a diesel engine. With a traditionally poor power-to-weight ratio, most diesel engines are generally unsuited for use on motorcycles which normally desire low weight, compact size, high RPMs and rapid acceleration. In the 1980s, NATO forces in Europe standardized all their vehicles to operate with diesel fuel. Some forces had fleets of motorcycles and trials were conducted with diesel engines on these. Air-cooled single-cylinder engines built by Lombardini of Italy were used and had some success. This led to some countries re-fitting their bikes with diesel engines. In 2005, the United States Marine Corps adopted the M1030M1, an off-road motorcycle based on the Kawasaki KLR650, and retrofitted it with an engine designed to run on diesel or JP8 jet fuel. Since other U.S. tactical vehicles like the HMMWV utility vehicle and M1 Abrams tank also use JP8, adopting a scout motorcycle which runs on the same fuel would ease logistics. Further development by Cranfield University and California-based Hayes Diversified Technologies led to the production of the Kawasaki KLR650 based motorcycle for military use. The engine of this motorcycle is a liquid-cooled, single-cylinder four-stroke which displaces 584 cc. In India, motorcycles built by Royal Enfield could be bought with 325 cc single-cylinder diesel engines because diesel fuel was much cheaper than petrol (gasoline) at the time, and of more reliable quality. These engines were noisy and unrefined and not very popular because of lower performance and higher weight penalties. The engines were originally designed for use in commercial applications such as electric generators and water pumps. Conversions Home-made diesel motorcycle A popular conversion choice is to put an industrial diesel engine single or twin cylinder in a modified motorcycle frame. An alternative is to use industrial diesel engines or diesel engines from small cars. Frames are modified or completely self-built. Production vehiclesSommer Diesel 462= alt= Sommer Motorradtechnik produces the Sommer Diesel 462. It is powered by Bavarian Hatz Diesel. The Sommer-diesel motorcycle is assembled by hand in small batches in Eppstein.

However, due to pollution laws, this bike is no longer produced. Initially street mechanics were mounting this engine in used Bullets, like retro Royal Enfield Bikes, with the 350 cc retrofit engine. On seeing the success of these bikes; Royal Enfield started manufacturing Bullets with the diesel engine and named it the Taurus. The Taurus was available with an electric starter in 1993. =Sooraj 325cc Diesel= Sooraj, a company based in Saharanpur, India produced a diesel motorcycle with a 4-speed Albion Royal Enfield gearbox fitted with a Lombardini 325cc engine. =Hayes Diversified Technologies M1030M1= M1030M1 - Diesel Military Motorcycle After several years engine development at Cranfield University, the HDT M1030M1 has entered service. It is produced by Hayes Diversified Technologies (HDT), and it is based around a modified Kawasaki KLR650. Top speed is approximately 90 mph (145 km/h) and fuel consumption is advertised to be at . M1030M1s have successfully taken part at the British National Rally and the Bonneville Speed Trials. The U.S. Marine Corps bought 440 of the M1030M1 model, under the name M1030M1 JP8/Diesel. The M1030M1E AVTUR/Diesel Military motorcycle is sold to British and European NATO countries. A version made for the civilian market, the D650A1 \\"Bulldog\\" was originally slated for release in March 2006, but due to increased military demand for the M1030M1, production of the civilian Bulldog has been delayed indefinitely. In the Summer of 2010 at Eurosatory, a French defence contractor exhibition, HDT presented the HDT 1030M2 a major upgrade of their present HDT1030M1. The 1030M2 chief change is an upgraded 670 cc engine which has a multifueled capability and produced 20% more power, and through a patented technology called MAC-C1 enables the engine to use not only standard automobile gasoline and truck diesel fuel, but five major jet fuel types; and even the heavier vegetable oil based biodiesel.

HistoryOrigins= The theatre began life as a small concert room above the stables of the Royal Standard Hotel, a small hotel and tavern built in 1832 at what was then 522 Stockbridge Terrace, on the site of the present theatre ‚Äì not, as sometimes stated, on land where the train station now stands. The proprietor, John Moy, enlarged the building, and by 1850 it became known as Moy's Music Hall. Alfred Brown took it over in 1863, refurbished it, and renamed it the Royal Standard Music Hall. The hotel was demolished in 1886, by which time the main line terminus, Victoria Station and its new Grosvenor Hotel, had transformed the area into a major transport hub. The railways were at this time building grand hotel structures at their termini, and Victoria was one of the first. Added to this was the integration of the electric underground system and the building of Victoria Street. The owner of the music hall, Thomas Dickey, had it rebuilt along more ambitious lines in 1886 by Richard Wake, retaining the name Royal Standard Music Hall. =Matcham's theatre= The Royal Standard was demolished in 1910, and in its place was built, at a cost of ¬£12,000, the current theatre, The Victoria Palace. It was designed by prolific theatre architect Frank Matcham, and opened 6 November 1911. The original design featured a sliding roof that helped cool the auditorium during intervals in the summer months. Under impresario Alfred Butt, the Victoria Palace Theatre continued the musical theatre tradition by presenting mainly varieties, and under later managements, repertory and revues.Victoria Palace Theatre (Arthur Lloyd theatre history) accessed 12 September 2008 Perhaps because of its music hall linkage, the plays were not always taken seriously. In 1934, the theatre presented Young England, a patriotic play written by the Rev. Walter Reynolds, then 83. It received such amusingly bad reviews that it became a cult hit and played to full houses for 278 performances before transferring to two other West End theatres. > Intended by its author as a serious work celebrating the triumph of good > over evil and the virtues of the Boy Scout Movement, it was received as an > uproarious comedy.

Me and My Girl was a hit in its original production at the theatre, opening in 1937 starring Lupino Lane. In 1939, songs from this show formed the first live broadcast of a performance by the BBC, and listeners could sing along to The Lambeth Walk.Still doing the Lambeth Walk The Times, 4 September 2006. Retrieved 24 August 2007 In early 1945, towards the end of the war in Europe, variety was presented under the stewardship of Lupino Lane. Headlining the bill from his radio series was Will Hay, with his schoolboy retinue of Charles Hawtrey and John Clark, and among the \\"turns\\" was Stainless Stephen, a comic acrobat comedian duo, and Victor Barna (then world champion table tennis player) giving an exhibition, who would invite audience members up on to the stage to see if they could beat him in ten points. From 1947 through 1962, Jack Hylton produced The Crazy Gang series of comedy revues, with a glittering company of variety performers including Flanagan and Allen, Nervo and Knox, and Naughton and Gold. The long- running Black and White Minstrel Show played through the 1960s until 1972. In 1982, a production of The Little Foxes, saw Elizabeth Taylor making her London stage debut. Another unusually long-running show at the theatre was Buddy ‚Äì The Buddy Holly Story, that played for 13 years in London, beginning in 1989 (transferring to the Strand Theatre in 1995). After this, the theatre presented mostly revivals of well-known musicals. In 2005, Billy Elliot the Musical opened, garnering rave reviews and Olivier awards. The theatre was purchased by Stephen Waley-Cohen in 1991. At the opening in 1911, a gilded statue of ballerina Anna Pavlova was positioned above the cupola of the theatre. This was taken down for its safety during World War II, and was lost. In 2006, a replica of the original statue was restored in its place.Victoria Palace history.

It is located on the north-east part of the central area of the city, and its limits are Ovidio Lagos Avenue (former La Plata Avenue), Francia Avenue (former Timb√∫es Boulevard), Rivadavia Avenue, and Salta St. The assembling of this barrio was motivated by the growth of the railway lines and the activity at the port due to agricultural exports, in the 19th century. The most important point in the neighbourhood was the Sunchales train station (now Rosario Norte), which marked the border between the populated urbanization and the developing suburbia. The station was also a tramway terminal. Rosario Norte Station. The main street in the barrio was Pichincha St., named after a battle in the Ecuadorian War of Independence. This name was then changed to Ricchieri (after General Pablo Ricchieri, a Minister of War of late 19th century). At the beginning of the 2000s, the municipal government revised history and rolled back the change, although the name Ricchieri still appears in most street signs as of 2006. Demographic growth of the city favoured the establishment of brothels. Since many of them were illegal, the municipality tried to control and set up a specific zone for them. Pichincha then became a kind of red-light district. In time, the Argentine railway system declined and the activity and attraction of the barrio diminished. In the first years of the 21st century, Pichincha started to recover, based on initiatives of its neighbours supported by the government. Since then, the barrio features a culture centre and several high-profile bars and restaurants, which take advantage of the retro appeal of the neighbourhood. The old structures have been preserved or restored. The municipality has encouraged this trend further, for example by employing old-fashioned street lampposts instead of modern lighting along Rivadavia Avenue. Since 2002 the Culture Secretariat of Rosario has a seat in the former Rosario Norte station. Each Sunday, Rivadavia Avenue is cut to host a Retro Fair (Feria Retro \\"La Huella\\") where kiosks offer antiques and there are open-air tango and theatre performances, open radio, puppet shows and others.

According to Pliny the best quality came from Bactria (today Afghanistan). Other named sources for the resin are India, Arabia, Media, and Babylon.  Composition  Bdellium consists of a water-soluble gum, a resin, and an essential oil. The essential oil of Commiphora africana contains predominantly Œ±-thujene, Œ±- and Œ≤-pinene, and p-cymene.  Uses  Bdellium is used in perfumery, as incense, and in traditional medicine. It is an adulterant of the more costly myrrh.  Name  Middle English, from Latin, from Greek Œ≤Œ¥Œ≠ŒªŒªŒπŒøŒΩ. Commiphora africana resin is also known as African bdellium. Relation to the Hebrew b'dolach () is uncertain. The Septuagint translates the term as a precious stone rather than a resin. In Genesis 2:12 it is given as a product of Havilah, where it is listed along with other precious items gold and onyx. Reference is made again in Numbers 11: \\"7 And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium.\\"King James Bible, Numbers 11:7 These are the only two uses in the Hebrew scripture. There is no agreement about whether the term referred to the resin, or to a precious stone.  History  Theophrastus is perhaps the first classical author to mention bdellium, if the report that came back from his informant in Alexander's expedition refers to Commiphora wightii: \\"In the region called Aria there is a thorn tree which produces a tear of resin, resembling myrrh in appearance and odour. It liquefies when the sun shines upon it.\\"Noted by Dalby 2002, ibid. It is also one of the first ores mentioned in the bible, in Genesis 2:12 Plautus in his play Curculio refers to it. Pliny the Elder, in his Natural History (12:36), describes the best bdellium coming from Bactria (identified as Commiphora wightii) as a \\"tree black in colour, and the size of the olive tree; its leaf resembles that of the oak and its fruit the wild fig\\", as well as bdellium coming from Nubia (identified as Commiphora africana). However, his descriptions seem to cover a range of strongly perfumed resins. The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, of the 2nd century CE, reports that bdella are exported from the port of Barbarice at the mouth of the Indus.Dalby 2000. The Bactrian variety is known among Arabs as . The bdellium referred to by Dioscorides as \\"the bdellium imported from Petra\\" (De Materia Medica, 1:80) is probably the resin of Hyphaene thebaica, a species of palm. The Arabs call it \\"Jewish bdellium.\\" Bdellium is the common English translation in the Bible (Genesis 2:12; Numbers 11:7) for Hebrew bedolach. In both passages the Septuagint understands it as the name of some precious stone, as does Rashi, who interprets it as \\"a precious stone, crystal\\", and Saadiah Gaon, as \\"pearls\\". The Midrash gives two opinions. According to one, it is a precious stone, and according to the other the reference is to \\"the bedola·∏• of perfumers\\". In Genesis the Midrash decides in favor of the first interpretation because there it is associated with gold and onyx. In Numbers, the reference to bdellium is in the context of the manna eaten by the Israelites in the wilderness, which is said to have \\"the color of bdellium\\" (Numbers 11:7). Manna was described as looking \\"like coriander seed, and being white in color and tasting like wafers of honey\\" (Exodus 16:14). In Numbers 11:7 Manna is said to have \\"the color of bdellium\\". Coriander seed is small and spherical, and the fruit of the Bdellium plant is spherical and looks light green to white depending on maturity. So one could conclude that Manna looked like small, round, white, soft or flaky pellets that tasted like sweet cream or honey. Bdillium fruit are small, round and white as are pearls, so Bdellium may have been a name for Pearls in Biblical times, resembling the round white fruit, and used by the author to describe Manna. In China, bdellium, known as ƒÅnxƒ´ xiƒÅng (ÂÆâÊÅØÈ¶ô) or \\"Parthian aromatic\\", was among the varieties of incense that reached China either along the Silk Route from Central Asia, or by sea. Later ƒÅnxƒ´ xiƒÅng was applied to an East Indian substitute, gum benzoin from Sumatra.Joseph Needham et al., Science and Civilisation in China, vol. 5 (Cambridge University Press) 1974, ¬ß33.Alchemy and Chemistry, p. 142f and note g. Bdellium was an ingredient in the prescriptions of ancient physicians from Galen to Paul of Aegina, and in the Greater Kuphi.Miller, Spice Trade, p. 71. Isidore of Seville reports in his Etymologiae (XVII.viii.6) that bdellium comes from trees in India and Arabia, the Arabian variety being better as it is smooth, whitish and smells good; the Indian variety is a dirty black..

He then traveled to Sorau and Breslau for further education, and finally to Regensburg, where he received musical training from Paulus Homberger. In 1615 he traveled to Berlin, where he studied theology at the Berlinisches Gymnasium zum Grauen Kloster. In 1616 he was engaged as a house tutor to the von Blumenthal family; his pupils included Joachim Friedrich von Blumenthal. From 1620 he studied theology at the University of Wittenberg and trained himself further in music through private study.

The factory was built on a site consisting of mainly sandhills and sand dunes to provide some protection against damage caused by an explosion. Its main product was TNT (Trinitrotoluene) used for shell filling. The same site was used in World War II to build another explosive factory ROF Pembrey, which also made TNT. Like all explosives factories, they needed a guaranteed year-round supply of water and good transport links. The site was connected to the Great Western Railway at Pembrey. Nineteenth-century dynamite factory A dynamite factory appears to have been built on a site at Pembrey in 1882 by the New Explosive Company of Stowmarket; it was bought by their competitors, Nobel's Explosives Company, in 1886 / 1887 and production was partially run-down. Ownership was then transferred to the South Wales Explosive Company, a subsidiary of Nobel's.Reader, (1970). Chapter 7: Dynamite and Smokeless Powder:Explosives for Peace and War 1886-1907. World War I: NEF Pembrey The site was then used by Nobel's Explosives to build a TNT / propellant factory in 1914 with Government approval. Its construction was a response to the need to drastically increase the production of shells in World War I (see Shell Crisis of 1915). The Pembrey site was one of the first purpose-built TNT manufacturing sites, in the United Kingdom, in World War I. The factory was initially owned by Nobel's Explosives, but in 1917 it was taken over by the Ministry of Munitions and it became a National Explosives Factory (NEF Pembrey).Reader, (1970). Chapter 14: Nobels Transformed 1914-1919. It produced 15,000 tons of TNT and 20,000 tons of propellant. The site was described as some . After the end of World War I, it closed and the administration building became a convalescence home for children from the families of unemployed miners. Its water supply works were taken over by the nearby town of Llanelli and used to supply the town with water. World War II: ROF Pembrey Work started in July 1938 to build a new factory on the site,https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/halltext/130326h0001.htm with the Ministry of Works acting as Agents. It opened in December 1939 under the control of the Ministry of Supply as one of several explosive Royal Ordnance Factories making TNT. Unlike the other TNT ROF's, however, ROF Pembrey also made tetryl and ammonium nitrate. Some 3,000 people were employed there in World War II. After the end of World War II, it continued to manufacture TNT and tetryl for military use; and ammonium nitrate for agricultural use as a fertiliser. From 1944 onwards, ROF Pembrey undertook breakdown of surplus ammunition, such as 4.5 inch anti-aircraft shells and bombs. The TNT being steamed out and then burnt. The chemical properties of explosive products manufactured or otherwise handled here, including TNT and ammonium nitrate, were continually sampled and tested in the chemical laboratory by technicians known as Junior Analysts. They included young women who were exposed to these hazardous materials on a daily basis. The title of Junior Analyst is still (2009) cited as a qualification for employment advertised in the region. Closure and disposal ROF Pembrey closed towards the end of 1964. In July 1965 the majority of the site, of leasehold land, was returned to the Forestry Commission and now forms Pembrey Country Park; and of freehold land was sold to a construction company.

For these crimes, he was one of the last persons executed in France. He was convicted of the abduction and murder on March 10, 1976. His case greatly influenced the debate over capital punishment in France after the book Le Pull-over rouge (1978) was published by former lawyer and journalist Gilles Perrault. It called Ranucci's guilt into question, and had a notable impact on public opinion, having sold over one million copies.50 ans de faits divers, \\"Christian Ranucci : la v√©rit√© impossible\\" , 13e Rue, July 13, 2006. Ranucci is the subject of the song \\"The Red Pullover\\" by British group The Gynaecologists. Early life Christian Ranucci was born in Avignon, France on April 6, 1954, to Jean Ranucci (1921-1988), a board painter and veteran of the Indochina War, and H√©lo√Øse Mathon (1922-2013), a caregiver. When he was four years old, he witnessed his father slashing his mother in the face with a knife ‚Äî similar to the one Ranucci would later use to commit murder ‚Äî at the door of a court after their divorce had been pronounced. However, other sources, like Ranucci's father, testified that his son did not really witness this attack, but only saw his injured mother as a nursemaid was bringing him in her arms back at home.Gilles Perrault (1978). Le Pull-over rouge, Ramsay, p. 132. Mother and son soon fled, moving home numerous times, as H√©lo√Øse Mathon was afraid that her ex-husband would kill them both (although Jean never attempted to find his son). As a result of this experience, she became an overprotective mother. Years later, Ranucci, charged with Rambla's murder, confessed to the examining magistrate that he had lived his entire childhood with the constant fear that his father, depicted as violent by his mother, would eventually find and kill him.G. Perrault (1978). Le Pull-over-rouge, Ramsay, p. 195. During his school years, Ranucci was described as a mediocre pupil, repeating a year, but still earning his National Diploma (BEPC) at the age of 17. He was often violent towards his schoolmates, and remained immature and uncommunicative as a young man.Dossier Ranucci: entretien avec Alain Rabineau - Dossier Ranucci : Peut-on douter ? Meanwhile, he worked as a waiter at a bar, Le Rio Bravo, owned by his mother, located in Saint-Jean-de- Moirans, near Voiron (Is√®re), which he ran when she was absent. They had lived in Nice since 1970. Ranucci eventually went to Wittlich, in Rhineland- Palatinate (West Germany), in order to complete his military service, which ended in March 1974. According to testimony by several comrades from his army days, his behaviour was impulsive, and his reactions were sometimes disproportionate. Later, as the murder case against him was unfolding, he was picked out as the abductor and offender of two children from Nice, though Ranucci was never sued for this, and theses facts were not formally proven. On May 24, 1974, he was hired by Ets COTTO, a company that made and sold air- conditioning equipment based in Nice, and began working as a door-to-door salesman.G. Perrault (1978). Le Pull-over rouge, Ramsay, p. 166. The crime When his mother refused to accompany him on a Pentecost weekend trip, Ranucci left Nice alone on June 2, 1974. After visiting the region, he arrived in Marseille on the morning of June 3, 1974. Looking for the home of a former military service comrade, he stopped in the Cit√© Sainte-Agn√®s housing estate (4th arrondissement). Distracted by the sight of a group of children involved in numerous games, he came across Marie-Dolor√®s Rambla, eight years old, and her six-and-a-half year old brother Jean-Baptiste, along with two nearby children playing behind a building, in the car park of a local garage.G√©rard Bouladou (2006). Autopsie d'une imposture. L'affaire Ranucci, toute la v√©rit√© sur le pull-over rouge, Pascal Petiot, pp. 157; 216-218. When the Rambla children were alone, around 11:10am - 11:15am, he moved his car to the car park, on the same level where the children were. Telling them he had lost a \\"big black dog\\", he asked for their help in searching for it. Sending the little boy off to track down the non-existent dog, he stayed with Marie- Dolor√®s, chatting for a few minutes, then persuaded her to get into his car - a grey Peugeot 304. According to his later confession, the girl was initially reluctant to go with him, making him repeat his offer; he eventually gained her trust by promising to return her home for lunch time. An hour later, arriving at a crossroads, he went through a stop sign and collided with another car, damaging both vehicles. He then turned around and fled in the direction of Marseilles, drove a few hundred metres before stopping at the bottom of a hill, exited from his car with the young girl, and climbed up into underbrush holding her left arm. Hearing Marie-Dolor√®s screaming and crying (she had just lost her right shoe and had to walk barefoot over the vegetation),G. Bouladou (2006). Autopsie d'une imposture..., Pascal Petiot, p. 27. he grabbed her by the neck and pushed her temple to the ground. He hit her head with stones then stabbed her in the throat with his flick knife (she reportedly received about fifteen blows).G. Bouladou (2006).

Rambla tried to resist by raising her right hand, but Ranucci soon stabbed the dorsal side of her hand. Afterwards, he covered the body with briars and thornbushes. Returning to his car, he drove for a while, then hid in a mushroom bed in order to change his flat tire, change his bloodied clothes, clean up, and hide his knife. However, when leaving, he needed help from people to get his car out of the mud. After having accepted a cup of tea, he got back to his home, Corniche Fleurie (overlooking Nice).G. Perrault (1978). Le Pull-over rouge, Ramsay, pp. 33-37.G. Bouladou (2006). Autopsie d'une imposture..., Pascal Petiot, pp. 29-30. Arrest, confession and profile Ranucci was arrested two days after the murder as he was returning from his office to his home in Nice. The girl's corpse had been found shortly before by a squad of gendarmes. He had been identified by his registration plate number, provided by witnesses to the car accident during his flight with the child. He confessed to the abduction and murder of Marie-Dolor√®s Rambla, and drew an accurate sketch of the kidnapping, then indicated the place where he disposed of the murder weapon, his bloodied flick knife, which was later found buried in a peat field stack by gendarmes. After being arrested, he was not recognized by the two witnesses to the abduction, and the only physical evidence implicating him in this phase of the crime was a drawing he made while in police custody showing the estate where the Rambla family lived.G. Bouladou (2006). Autopsie d'une imposture..., Pascal Petiot, pp. 116-121. Psychiatrists who heard Ranucci's conversation during sessions diagnosed him as having an \\"immature and backward sexuality\\". According to their report this, coupled with a need for company, had led to the desire to take children and spend time with them. He was not profiled as a pedophile, but rather as someone whose sexual identity remained undefined, though the psychiatrists asserted he showed \\"keen interest\\" in children. While confessing, Ranucci claimed he had no intention of harming the girl and only wished to go for a ride with her.From the archive, 29 July 1976: \\"Guillotine returns after two years\\" , theguardian.com, July 29, 2011. He explained the murder was a result of panic and fear due to the accident. His motive for the abduction still remains unclear, as no signs of rape or other sexual assault were found on the victim's body. Months later, while incarcerated at Baumettes prison (9th arrondissement of Marseille), he repudiated his confession after learning he was of the same blood type as the little girl (bloodstains had been found on his pants seized in his car trunk),G. Bouladou (2006). Autopsie d'une imposture..., Pascal Petiot, p. 322. and hearing about a local pedophile who wore a red polo shirt or sweater ‚Äî according to testimonies ‚Äî similar to the one discovered near the mushroom bed where he had hidden after the murder.G. Perrault (1978). Le Pull-over rouge, Ramsay, p. 222-223. Andr√© Fraticelli, Ranucci's lawyer, originally planned to plead mitigating circumstances, citing his client's difficult childhood, the sight of his father slashing his mother's face, and the numerous moves made across France as a defence in court. Fraticelli wanted the jury to consider Ranucci's state of mind and consciousness while committing murder, and whether he was really accountable for the crime, rather than his guilt.G. Perrault (1978). Le Pull-over rouge, Ramsay, p. 244-246. However, as Ranucci had retracted his confession, his other two lawyers conformed to his wishes, and chose to plead his innocence.G. Perrault (1978). Le Pull-over rouge, Ramsay, p. 248.  Trial and execution  He was tried in Aix-en-Provence in southern France on March 9 and 10, 1976, just three weeks after Patrick Henry was arrested in Troyes for another child murder. Journalists described public opinion as sensitive to the point of hysteria, demanding death penalties for child murderers. On the advice of his mother, Ranucci came to court dressed like a clergyman, sporting a large pectoral cross, which irritated most of the jury, and was interpreted by a few observers as an indication of his immaturity. Ranucci appeared arrogant during the trial, denying the crime and his guilt, despite the physical evidence and the details he had provided during his confession.Secrets d'actualit√©, \\"Affaire Ranucci : l'ombre d'un doute\\" , M6, September 4, 2005.Genevi√®ve Donadini (2016). Le proc√®s Ranucci : T√©moignage d'un jur√© d'assises, L'Harmattan, p. 52. Found guilty on all counts on March 10, 1976, he was sentenced to death. During the last hearing, and after his advocate's plea, minutes were communicated at the last moment to the jury and the defence lawyers, which, while not unheard of or illegal, was an extremely rare procedure. This was later used as an argument before the Court of Cassation. Again on his mother's advice, Ranucci wrote a 74-page document titled \\"R√©capitulatif\\" (\\"Summary\\") while on death row, in which he summed up the case from his point of view, and attempted to prove he was innocent. G√©rard Bouladou, a retired police officer who has written books about the case, has observed signs of mythomania in this document and argued that Ranucci was trying to persuade himself of his own innocence.G. Bouladou (2006). Autopsie d'une imposture..., Pascal Petiot, p. 229-230. His appeal for a second trial was denied by the Court of Cassation on June 17, 1976. \\"Crim., 17 juin 1976, pourvoi n¬∞ 76-90888 (Rejet du pourvoi en cassation de Christian Ranucci)\\" . On July 26, President Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing eventually refused a pardon for Ranucci. He was executed by guillotine in the courtyard of Baumettes prison, in Marseilles, on July 28, 1976, at 4:13am. Two of his lawyers who witnessed the execution claimed his last words were \\"R√©habilitez-moi!\\" (\\"Clear my name!\\"), but executioner Andr√© Obrecht wrote in his memoirs that the condemned said nothing before dying, his last word being a \\"Negative!\\" shouted at the chaplain when he refused to receive communion. His third lawyer, Andr√© Fraticelli, confirmed that Ranucci never asked to be rehabilitated. It is also specified in the minutes of the execution that Ranucci \\"made no statement\\".\\"LE PROC√àS-VERBAL OFFICIEL\\", Le Monde, July 29, 1976.  Aftermath: controversy, political debate and attempted requests for review  A novel by Gilles Perrault entitled Le Pull-over rouge (The Red Sweater), disputed Ranucci's involvement in the crime, expressing the writer's doubts about his guilt. The title of the book refers to a red sweater found hidden in the mushroom bed where Ranucci hid after his car accident, which seemed similar to that worn by another man who sexually abused children in another Marseilles estate, just two days before Rambla's kidnapping and murder. During the inquiry, when asked about the sweater, Ranucci denied being its owner. In his book, Perrault took on board Ranucci's final defence, arguing that a concussion he allegedly suffered as a result of the accident, right at the bottom of the crime scene, caused Ranucci to become victim to manipulation and impersonation by the \\"real murderer\\". In this theory, the man is supposed to have moved the unconscious door-to-door salesman to the rear seat of Ranucci's own car, then drove the vehicle (carrying Ranucci) to the mushroom bed where he then hid his red sweater.G. Perrault (1978). Le Pull-over rouge, Ramsay, pp. 387-395. However, nothing within the penal case could corroborate this version; Perrault himself had no explanation or rebuttal to the main evidence, in particular the hiding place of the murder weapon Ranucci revealed. The victim's father, Pierre Rambla, vehemently opposed the book and the subsequent campaign that supported Perrault's theses, arguing it made his family suffer, especially his elder son Jean-Baptiste who is among the last people to have seen Marie-Dolor√®s alive.P. Rambla (2008). Le \\"Cirque\\" Rouge, Soci√©t√© des √âcrivains, pp. 26-29; 56-65. The book was made into a film by Michel Drach in 1979, starring Serge Av√©dikian as Ranucci. A television film about the case, L'affaire Christian Ranucci: Le combat d'une m√®re, starring Alexandre Hamidi and Catherine Frot as Christian Ranucci and his mother, was broadcast in 2007. The controversy next entered politics, influencing the debate on capital punishment in France, which culminated in criminal lawyer, and newly nominated Minister of Justice, Robert Badinter addressing the National Assembly in September 1981 to defend his bill to abolish capital punishment. As a request for reconsideration had been submitted to him, he claimed, with regard to the Ranucci case, that there were: \\"too many questions about his case, and [that] these questions were sufficient [...] to condemn the death penalty\\".Discours de Robert Badinter sur l'abolition de la peine de mort , Gallica, September 17, 1981. On the other hand, some journalists who covered the case rejected Perrault's miscarriage of justice arguments. Christian Chardon, who covered the case for D√©tective, wrote an article for the newspaper Minute titled \\"Non ! L'affaire Ranucci n'est pas une erreur judiciaire\\" (\\"No! The Ranucci case was not a miscarriage of justice\\") in late 1978, in which he recapped the key points of the case and argued for Ranucci's guilt. Chardon denied that Ranucci had been tortured as claimed during his trial. (In particular, he had accused Commissioner G√©rard Alessandra, chief of the criminal section \\"Nord\\" in the H√¥tel de Police de Marseille, who was in charge of the inquiry.)Christian Chardon (September 13, 1978). \\"Non ! L'affaire Ranucci n'est pas une erreur judiciaire\\", Minute no 857, p. 27. In late 1979, Jean Laborde published an article in Paris-Match which he titled \\"Ranucci innocent ? Eh bien non !\\" (\\"Ranucci innocent? Well no!\\"), also rejecting Perrault's claims regarding Ranucci's innocence. In 1989, having accused the policemen in charge of the inquiry of \\"abuse of authority\\" in a 1985 TV program titled Qui a tu√© Christian Ranucci?

In 2008, Perrault and his publisher Fayard were found guilty of defamation against the Marseille police in another book, L'ombre de Christian Ranucci, in which it was stated that the investigators behaved with \\"casualness and partisanship\\". Perrault was fined 5,000 euros and his publisher an equal sum for each policeman defamed, a decision confirmed and increased to 10,000 euro for each of the four policemen on appeal in 2009.\\"Gilles Perrault et son √©diteur condamn√©s pour diffamation\\", La Provence, January 27, 2009. Since the publishing of Le Pull-over rouge, which was followed by the creation of the \\"Comit√© national pour la r√©vision du proc√®s Ranucci\\", there have been three requests for a review of the Ranucci trial, all being ultimately rejected, the Minister of Justice and afterwards the \\"Commission de r√©vision des condamnations p√©nales\\" of the Court of cassation arguing each time that no new facts had proven Ranucci's innocence nor even cast doubt upon his guilt.Associated Press (November 30, 1991). \\"'Le pull-over rouge': pas de r√©vision du proc√®s Ranucci\\", Le SoirAffaire Ranucci : POURQUOI R√âVISER ? - Les demandes de r√©visions .

Despite the creation of the association \\"Affaire Ranucci: Pourquoi r√©viser?\\" by four Parisian students in 2002, there have been no further attempts to seek reconsideration since 1991 - the rejection date of the last request. Although some rumors circulated in 2006 about the presence of serial killer Michel Fourniret in Marseille area in 1974 and his assumed attendance of the Ranucci trial, Fourniret himself rectified saying he went to Marseilles region as a child and was working in Paris when the crime occurred; furthermore, an anthropometric study concluded that photographs taken at Ranucci's trial in 1976 of a man who seemed at a first sight to look like Fourniret, did not match pictures of the real Fourniret at that time.\\"Fourniret n'√©tait pas au proc√®s Ranucci\\" , Le Nouvel Observateur, July 4, 2006. On multiple occasions, former President of the Republic Giscard d'Estaing has said in interviews that he did not feel remorse regarding his role in the case; he mentioned to journalist Laurent Delahousse in 2010 that he did not regret his decision to decline clemency to Ranucci, claiming that he was indeed guilty and that \\"he had to be punished\\".\\"Giscard d'Estaing ne regrette pas d'avoir refus√© sa gr√¢ce √† Ranucci\\" , AFP & Le Point, October 9, 2010.

Jean-Baptiste Rambla's murder cases In February 2005 Jean-Baptiste Rambla, Marie-Dolor√®s' brother, was arrested during the investigation into the disappearance of Corinne Beidl, his employer. Rambla had killed her as a result of a violent dispute about his salary. He was convicted of her murder and sentenced to an 18-year prison term in October 2008. According to his lawyers, his behaviour was influenced by drug addiction and the media coverage surrounding the guilt of his sister's murderer.Gilles Halais (October 15, 2008). \\"Ouverture du proc√®s Rambla, sur fond d‚Äôaffaire Ranucci\\", France Info. After being paroled in early 2015, he was charged once more with the brutal murder of a 21-year-old girl committed in Toulouse in August 2017, and has gone back to jail.Claire Lagadic (August 12, 2017). ‚Ä≥Le terrible pass√© de Jean-Baptiste Rambla\\" in La D√©p√™che du Midi.

His active-duty career included service in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Early life and career Young was born in Lexington, Kentucky, on 31 March 1852. He was appointed a midshipman on 21 June 1869 and served in the practice ships , , and before graduating from the United States Naval Academy on 31 May 1873. Young was detached from Alaska at Lisbon, Portugal, and soon joined . Commissioned as ensign on 16 July 1874, he joined ‚Äîon the North Atlantic Station‚Äîon 10 December of the following year. Wreck of the USS Huron Subsequently, Young was ordered to , where he served until her tragic grounding off Nags Head, North Carolina, on 24 November 1877. The ship, en route to Cuban waters for survey duty, foundered shortly after 01:00 on the 24th. Ensign Young and an enlisted man, Seaman Antoine Williams, struggled ashore through the tumbling surf and gained the beach. Not receiving much assistance from an apparently apathetic group of bystanders, Young sent a horseman off at a gallop for a life-saving depot seven miles away while he, himself, although bruised and barefoot, walked four miles to yet another station, and, apparently finding it unmanned, broke in and got out mortar lines and powder for a Lyle gun. The sheriff of the locality then took Williams and Young to a point abreast the wreck. By the time they arrived, however, the 34 survivors had already reached shore. For their heroism, Young and Williams both received the Gold Lifesaving Medal. Sea and shore-based assignments, 1870s‚Äì1880s Ordered to on 17 March 1878, he arrived in Le Havre, France, in time to take charge of a detail of men to serve at the Universal Exposition in Paris, France. Following that duty, he served in Portsmouth with the Training Squadron until he was detached from that ship on 5 April 1880. Young's next tour of duty was ashore, in the Bureau of Equipment and Recruiting; and, while there, he served for a time as naval aide to the Secretary of the Navy. Master Young then served successive tours of sea duty in the monitor and the training ship . Next came service as executive officer of and, finally, a tour holding the same office in . While in the latter, Young took part in the landings in Panama to protect American interests in the spring of 1885. A series of assignments ashore followed: Naval Torpedo Station, Newport, R.I.; at the Naval War College at Newport; at the Bureau of Navigation, and at the office of Naval War Records‚Äîthe activity then compiling the monumental documentary collection, the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Navies. Young next returned to sea, serving successive tours in , , , and . Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii During the Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, Young was based on the USS Boston 1892-93 as part of the invading force ordered by United States Government Minister John L. Stevens to land at Honolulu. Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Given command of , Lieutenant Young placed that ship in commission and, during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, took part in two engagements off Manzanillo, Cuba, and in the cutting of the cable between Cape Cruz and Manzanillo from late June 1898 to mid-August. Relieved of command of Hist in February 1899, Young received promotion to lieutenant commander on 3 March and became Captain of the Port of Havana on 22 August of the same year. In the spring of 1900, he became Commandant, Naval Station, Havana. Explosion of the USS Bennington Following his duty in Cuba, Young became lighthouse inspector in the 9th Naval District and served in that capacity into 1904. In March 1904, he was given command of (Gunboat No. 4) and was in command of that ship at the time of her boiler explosion in the summer of the following year. At San Diego on 21 July 1905, Bennington was preparing to get underway for sea; Commander Young and the ship's surgeon, F. E. Peck, were returning to the ship in a boat and were not far from the anchorage when the explosion occurred at 10:30. Young hurried back to the ship, took command, ordered her watertight compartments closed and her magazines flooded, and then secured the services of an Army tugboat nearby. For this accident, he was court-martialed, convicted and censured for \\"remissness in performance\\". More than 60 died in the blast.New International Encyclopedia He was later reprimanded by the Secretary of the Navy for verbally abusing a fellow officer who testified in the matter. Young's Navy personnel records reveal that the Secretary of the Navy reprimanded Young for a public verbal dispute with a Lt. Commander Bartlett who had testified in the proceeding. Young, on a public pier, called Bartlett a \\"liar and a perjurer\\". The Secretary of the Navy labeled Young's actions as \\"grossly insulting to a brother officer\\" and that to Young there was \\"only one course available\\" a \\"full, frank, and manly apology for a display of temper.\\" Which, after a delay of several days, Young did. His Naval records show another censure for \\"misleading and inaccurate reporting\\" regarding the boilers of the in 1909. No explosion resulted simply several days of delay. Later assignments Young later was assigned to duty at the Mare Island Navy Yard and was there at the time of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire, and did much relief work. Ultimately he became Captain of the Yard there before becoming Commandant of the Naval Station, Pensacola, and of the 8th Naval District. His area of command was later extended to include the 7th Naval District. He was appointed Rear Admiral in 1910. Last years and legacy Dupont Circle neighborhood of Washington, D.C. Young's Navy personnel records reveal an instance of apparent anti- Semitism. Young failed to pay a small [$7] tailoring bill. The tailor, one Frank Copper of Vallejo, California, wrote to the Secretary of the Navy complaining after several years of non-payment. The SecNav forwarded the letter to Young for a response. In his written response Young wrote that he had made inquiry in \\"Vallejo as to who this man [Copper] was, and was informed he was a weak and cranky Jew and that he ran a small hat store in town; that upon two occasions his shop was burned down under suspicious circumstances.\\" Young further went on, in response to the SecNav's request that his response be furnished to Copper wrote for \\"me now to furnish him with a compulsory copy of this official endorsement, as directed in the 1st endorsement, for him to flaunt about his Hebrew friends, would be to him an excellent advertisement, and a decided humiliation to me.\\" He died at New York, N.Y., on 2 October 1912.

Some people, in online forums, have criticised Irish rock band Snow Patrol, for their video \\"Signal Fire\\", made two years later, in which the band similarly plays while a grade school play is in progress.HORSE the Band claims Snow Patrol stole \\"Birdo\\" video, PunkNews.org, April 26, 2007 * \\"A Million Exploding Suns\\" is a reference to the Marvel comic book character The Sentry. The song also features a keyboard rendition of part of the first level theme song from the game Bionic Commando. * \\"The House of Boo\\" holds reference to the stage and home of the ghost characters, Boos, in several of the Mario video game series titles. It also includes the score used in the games. The song itself is actually about Nathan's childhood, and an incident involving someone breaking into his home, and the resulting trauma. * The title of the album gives reference to the Mechanical Hound in the novel Fahrenheit 451. The Phoenix on the album cover is also a reference to the Phoenix Crest, worn by the future firefighters in the novel.

The title itself involves a discussion about \\"the intersections of three fields: psychology, the Bible, and the tradition of rigorous, critical reading of the biblical text.\\" (Kille, 2001). Known figures within biblical scholarship advocating this interdisciplinary field in the United States include Rev. D. Andrew Kille (2001; 2004), J. Harold Ellens (2004), Wayne G. Rollins (1983; 1999; 2004), and, in Europe, Eugen Drewermann (Beier, 2004), Gerd Theissen (1983, 1987, 2007). Rollins was the first to define psychological biblical criticism as having the hermeneutical intent of examining The worlds of Scripture Unlike many other forms of biblical criticism, psychological biblical criticism is not a particular method for interpretation, but is rather a perspective (Kille, 2001). This approach to the biblical text seeks to complement studies on the cultural, sociological, and anthropological influences on scripture, by discussing the psychological dimensions of: the authors of the text, the material they wish to communicate to their audience, and the reflections and meditations of the reader. As a result, the material under study involves three dimensions of text (Rollins, 1983; Kille, 2001; 2004). =The world behind the text= What was the author of the text thinking? What was their background, why were they writing? What situations drove them to put pen to paper and produce this work? What is the cultural, historical, and social context of the text? Although traditional uses of psychological theory in the study of ancient texts have sought to generate a complete psychoanalysis of scriptural writers, there has always been the hindrance of temporal and cultural distance between the analyst and analysand. Psychological biblical criticism best serves not as a reductionistic tool, but as another heuristic for use alongside traditional methods of historical and cultural criticism, illuminating aspects of purpose and meaning in the language and cognition of texts (Kille, 2001: 22‚Äì23; 2004: 23‚Äì25). In essence, a study of the world behind the text involves such questions as \\"... what makes them write the way they do and what realities, truths, and insights they want to share with us.\\" (Rollins, 1983: 99). =The world of the text= Why did King Saul decide try to skewer David‚Äîhis greatest warrior‚Äîwith a spear? Why did Judas hand Jesus over? What is the meaning of Genesis Chapter 1? To analyze the world of the text is to \\"describe the qualities of a character as he or she is presented in the text\\" (Kille, 2001:24), their actions and relationships, as well as develop insight into the motivations the writer has programmed into them. Kille in particular warns that one should be wary of trying to reach beyond the world of the text to the actual historical persons, since one may accidentally perform the function of eisegesis rather than exegesis. The world of the text may also shine light on the conditions and intent of the writer. On the one hand the characters and events within the text may reflect more the writer's socio-cultural situation than actual events, while at the same time they may inform us as to what the writer desires from us‚Äîtransformation, repentance, enlightenment, etc. (Kille, 2004). =The world in front of the text= How do I approach the text? What does the text ask of me? How do I respond to it? What meaning do I give to this relationship? The world in front of the text discusses the interplay between the text before our very eyes and the eisegetical processes that take place within our mind. In this exchange the interest is not in the psychological world of the writer, or the original meaning of the text and the characters displayed, but in how the reader manipulates, interprets, and is filled by the text; how they make it relevant to their lives, how it \\"speaks\\" to them, and how this relationship reflects their personal world (Rollins 1983: 97‚Äì100; Kille, 2001: 25‚Äì27; 2004: 27‚Äì29). The Bible and psychology in transition A psychological study of the hermeneutical levels of religious texts has the capability of granting a better understanding not only of the text itself, but also of the mind that produced it, the mind that it describes, and the mind that interacts with it. This knowledge has promise for interdisciplinary application as well, by informing the field of religious studies, the psychotherapeutic encounter, and the psychology of religion. Hence, proponents of psychological biblical criticism argue that it has the potential of crossing the gap between psychology and religion, providing a platform for dialogue without reducing religion to mere drives and internal objects, but by discussing the aspects of this very human mode of meaning (Ellens, 2004).

The first book was written by him was Western philosophy (the course of wisdom in Europe). Foroughi also edited Saadi's book Koliyat and founded the Academy of Iran. He also attended the Ferdowsi Millennium Congress. In addition, Foroughi has authored numerous works on history (especially ancient Iranian history). Early life and education Foroughi was born in Tehran to a merchant family from Isfahan. His ancestor, Mirza Abutorab was the representative of Isfahan in Mugan plain during Nader Shah Afshar's coronation. His grandfather, Mohammad Mehdi Arbab Isfahani, was amongst the most influential merchants of Isfahan and was skilled in history and geography. His father Mohammad Hosein Foroughi was the translator of the Shah from Arabic and French. He was also a poet and published a newspaper called Tarbiat. Naser al-Din Shah Qajar nicknamed Mohammad Hosein, Foroughi, after hearing a poem that he had written.Bagher Agheli, A biography of political and military figures in contemporary Iran, Elm publishing, Tehran, 2001. During his early life, Foroughi studied at the √©lite Dar ul-Funun (House of Sciences) in Tehran. Career In 1907, Foroughi's father died, and thus Foroughi inherited his father's title of Zoka-ol-Molk. During the same year, Foroughi became the dean of Tehran School of Political Science. In 1909, he entered politics as a member of Majlis (Parliament), representing Tehran. He subsequently became speaker of the house and later minister in several cabinets as well as prime minister three times and once as the acting prime minister when Reza Khan resigned as prime minister to take up the crown as Reza Shah. In 1912, he became the president of the Iranian Supreme Court. Later he was appointed prime minister and dismissed in 1935 due to the father of his son-in-law's, Muhammad Vali Asadi, alleged participation in the riot in Mashhad against the reforms implemented by Reza Shah. However, later Foroughi regained his status and became Prime Minister during the initial phase of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's reign. Foroughi as a prime minister was instrumental in having Mohammad Reza Pahlavi proclaimed as king after his father, Reza Shah, was forced to abdicate (16 September 1941) and exiled by the allied forces of the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union during World War II. After the collapse of his cabinet, he was named Minister of Court and then named ambassador of Iran to the United States of America, but he died in Tehran at the age of 67 before he could assume the post.

Admiralty Board (, Admiralteystv-Kollegiya) was a supreme body for the administration of the Imperial Russian Navy in the Russian Empire, established by Peter the Great on December 12, 1718, and headquartered in the Admiralty building, Saint Petersburg. History The responsibilities of the Admiralty Board had been changing throughout its history. It supervised the construction of military ships, ports, harbors, and canals and administered Admiralty Shipyard. The Admiralty Board was also in charge of naval armaments and equipment, preparation of naval officers etc. The first president of the Admiralty Board was Count Fyodor Apraksin.

It is located just east of the Advance Community (near Poolville), and along with Slipdown Bluff is the highest point in Parker County, and also the highest point within the Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth Metroplex. The \\"mountain\\" is beside Slip Down Road, and has a steep limestone cliff on the west side. In the History of Parker County, Eunice Boley Harris mentions Slipdown Mountain in her article about the Advance Community: > \\"We also had a 'fun spot' near Advance called 'Slip Down Mountain.' Young > and old alike met there for baseball, Easter egg hunts, wiener roasts, > picnics, and 'dinner on the ground.'\\" The first white settlers to the area arrived in the early 1850s. James Lanman settled the Western flank, William H Dunison to the South, and Thomas Sullivan to the Southeast. At this time this was still Comanche country and accounts of early Indian raids can be found in the books A Cry Unheard by Doyle Marshall and History of Parker County and the Double Log Cabin by G.A. Holland. One such raid, the Sullivan-Blackwell attack, took place in 1866. Six-year-old Thomas Sullivan Jr. and cousin Fremont Blackwell, seven, were taken captive. Thommy was later killed but Fremont lived with the Indians for over a year before being ransomed. An account of this raid by Fremont's younger brother Benjamin can be found on the Oklahoma Gen Web site. One of the theories as to the name ‚ÄúSlipdown Mountain‚Äù comes from this period. Today the area is covered with live oaks and cedars, but in 1850 this area was grassland prairie and one could see for miles in every direction. The Comanches could use this high ground as a vantage point to observe the settlers and then ‚Äúslip down‚Äù into the homesteads on their night time raids. In 1856 the State of Texas granted a railroad right-of-way to the Memphis, El Paso and Pacific RR which was later bought by the Texas & Pacific RR. The survey for the right-of-way was done in 1861 and all land not already homesteaded was sectioned off and became part of the RR reserve and the Texas Permanent School Fund. Then in 1889 A.J. Stratton bought the high point and surrounding land from the School Fund for $3 an acre. A.J.'s son George was one of the founders of the nearby town of Advance one mile to the West. The thriving town had a general store, two gins, a public school, and churches that were active until after World War II. Today nothing remains of the town but the place name.

Biography Everton Conger was born in Huron County, Ohio, in 1834.Some sources state that Everton Conger was born in what is now West Virginia He was the son of Rev. Enoch Conger, a Presbyterian minister. In 1856, he moved to Fremont, Ohio, where he established a dental practice. Conger enlisted in the Union army during the Civil War, initially as a private in the three-months 8th Ohio Infantry. He returned to Fremont with the expiration of his term of enlistment and married Emma \\"Kate\\" Boren on October 16, 1861, with whom he had five children. He later became a captain in the 3rd West Virginia Cavalry and eventually rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel of the 1st District of Columbia Cavalry. He suffered three severe wounds during combat and was assigned to detached duty in Washington, D.C., joining General Lafayette Baker's intelligence service as a detective. John Wilkes Booth's escape route, tracked by Everton Conger and a Union army detachment Following the assassination of President Lincoln on April 14, 1865, Conger was ordered to accompany a detachment of 25 Union soldiers from the 16th New York Cavalry Regiment, led by Lieutenant Edward P. Doherty. The soldiers pursued Booth through Southern Maryland and across the Potomac and Rappahannock rivers to Richard Garrett's farm, just south of Port Royal, Caroline County, Virginia. Booth and his accomplice, David E. Herold, had been led to the farm by William Storke \\"Willie\\" Jett, formerly a private in the 9th Virginia Cavalry, whom they had met before crossing the Rappahannock. Conger tracked down Jett and interrogated him, learning of Booth's location at the Garrett farm, and led the soldiers there. Arriving early in the morning of April 26, 1865, the soldiers found Booth and Herold hiding in a tobacco barn. Although Herold surrendered, Booth refused. Conger set fire to the barn and Sergeant Boston Corbett mortally wounded Booth by shooting him in the neck. Booth was dragged from the barn and died on the porch of the Garrett farmhouse. The porch of the Garrett farmhouse, where Booth died in 1865 Conger removed Booth's personal effects, including a diary. Conger was given $15,000 as a reward for the successful operation. The city of Fremont gave him a pair of inscribed silver- handled pistols in recognition for his role in tracking down Booth. Conger moved to Illinois, built a home, and practiced law in Carmi. Later he was appointed a United States District Court judge in the Montana Territory. He eventually moved to Hawaii to live with his daughter, dying there in 1918. He was buried in Montana.

The Tait conjectures involve concepts in knot theory such as alternating knots, chirality, and writhe. All of the Tait conjectures have been solved, the most recent being the Flyping conjecture. Background A reduced diagram is one in which all the isthmi are removed. Tait came up with his conjectures after his attempt to tabulate all knots in the late 19th century. As a founder of the field of knot theory, his work lacks a mathematically rigorous framework, and it is unclear whether he intended the conjectures to apply to all knots, or just to alternating knots. It turns out that most of them are only true for alternating knots. In the Tait conjectures, a knot diagram is called \\"reduced\\" if all the \\"isthmi\\", or \\"nugatory crossings\\" have been removed. Crossing number of alternating knots Tait conjectured that in certain circumstances, crossing number was a knot invariant, specifically: > Any reduced diagram of an alternating link has the fewest possible > crossings. In other words, the crossing number of a reduced, alternating link is an invariant of the knot. This conjecture was proved by Louis Kauffman, Kunio Murasugi (ÊùëÊùâ ÈÇ¶Áî∑), and Morwen Thistlethwaite in 1987, using the Jones polynomial. A geometric proof, not using knot polynomials, was given in 2017 by Joshua Greene. Writhe and chirality A second conjecture of Tait: > An amphicheiral (or acheiral) alternating link has zero writhe. This conjecture was also proved by Kauffman and Thistlethwaite. Flyping A flype move. The Tait flyping conjecture can be stated: > Given any two reduced alternating diagrams D_1 and D_2 of an oriented, prime > alternating link: D_1 may be transformed to D_2 by means of a sequence of > certain simple moves called flypes. The Tait flyping conjecture was proved by Thistlethwaite and William Menasco in 1991. The Tait flyping conjecture implies some more of Tait's conjectures: > Any two reduced diagrams of the same alternating knot have the same writhe. This follows because flyping preserves writhe. This was proved earlier by Murasugi and Thistlethwaite. It also follows from Greene's work. For non- alternating knots this conjecture is not true; the Perko pair is a counterexample. This result also implies the following conjecture: > Alternating amphicheiral knots have even crossing number.Alexander > Stoimenow, \\"Tait's conjectures and odd amphicheiral knots\\", Bull. Amer. > Math. Soc. (N.S.) 45 (2008), no. 2, 285‚Äì291. This follows because a knot's mirror image has opposite writhe. This conjecture is again only true for alternating knots: non-alternating amphichiral knot with crossing number 15 exist.

Operation In the Production Vehicle (PV), lasers, vertical and horizontal actuators, gyros and accelerometers, measure the interaction of the vehicle passing over the track. Outputs from the measuring system include track gauge, alignment, twist and cant. Other systems on the roof of DV measure features such as overhead line height and stagger. On the West Coast Main Line, particular care has to be taken to ensure that clearances are maintained for the use of tilting trains. The train captures video footage from the front and rear power cars. The Development Vehicle (DV) includes a video based system utilising image recognition systems to look for defects such as missing clips. DV also houses a non-contact Over-Head Line monitoring system.This system utilises lasers to measure the position of the OH wires in relationship to the rails the train is on. High powered white lights and cameras also enable the wear of the contact wire to be monitored. The wear on the contact wire is measured as the width of a strip on the underside, where the pantographs of trains come into contact and wear away the cable. If the original thickness of the cable is known, this can be converted into a percentage of remaining area, which in turn when related to a maximum allowable wear can give an estimate of the remaining life left. The track recording systems vehicle has banks of screens allowing the team of three operators to view a range of system outputs, including track faults, train location, and radio signal strength. One of the Messing Cars hosts a system for monitoring and commissioning of Network Rail's GSM-R network. It is allocated to Heaton TMD in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, returning there for scheduled maintenance every Saturday afternoon. Maintenance of the recording equipment is carried out at the Railway Technical Centre in Derby. Models Hornby released a train pack of the two HST power cars.

Life There are few certain dates concerning his life, since Sulzberger himself contributed to keeping some facts unclear (for example, his birth year). Sulzberger was born in Frankfurt of Swiss parents in 1876. In 1900 he studied at the university and conservatory in Z√ºrich, where he was in contact with Othmar Schoeck and Gabriel Faur√©. He was recommended to pursue further studies in Paris with Charles Marie Widor and went there in 1906. He returned to Z√ºrich in 1911. Sulzberger was a close friend and great admirer of Ferruccio Busoni, who had emigrated to Switzerland during the World War I. It also seems certain that in 1917 Sulzberger participated - apparently without result - in an event at the Dada gallery in Z√ºrich, in which Hugo Ball and Tristan Tzara among others participated. Works During his studies, the young francophile Sulzberger was influenced by Claude Debussy's music. He was one of the first Swiss composers who experimented with bitonal and tritonal music, rather than a single tonality. Others also see an echo of Faur√© and the style of the Second Viennese School in his music. Sulzberger's compositions were never well regarded by the Swiss critics of the time, since his style of composition was much before its time. * Lieder f√ºr Gesang und Klavier, from there \\"An die Entfernte\\" * Chanson d'√©t√© * Cort√®ge et f√™te f√ºr Klavier (lost) * Sonate f√ºr Violine und Klavier (1919), premiere in Paris (1924) Leavings *In the Central Library of Z√ºrich, letters from e.g. Hugo Ball, Busoni, Debussy, Ernst von Dohn√°nyi, Joseph Szigeti, Richard Strauss and Felix Weingartner that were left behind by Sulzberger are located.

It has been reported that Arsenio Farell Cubillas had assisted PRI's (Institutional Revolutionary Party) Miguel Nazar Haro and Luis Echeverr√≠a √Ålvarez to detain and torture suspected terrorists (leftists, intellectuals, etc.) during the Dirty War (Mexico), from 1964‚Äì1982.

The plot alludes to Northern Mexico's feminicide, beginning in the early 1990s and disproportionately affecting the border city. The maquiladoras also symbolize the PRI's long-standing facade of democracy and free trade built on the backs of the working poor.

The oldest gold treasure in the world, dating from 4,600 BC to 4,200 BC, was discovered at the site. Gems and Gemstones: Timeless Natural Beauty of the Mineral World, By Lance Grande Clay anthropomorphic head, Late Chalcolithic period, 4500-4000 BCE, Hamangia Culture, found submerged in Varna Lake, Varna Archeology Museum Discovery and excavation The site was accidentally discovered in October 1972 by excavator operator Raycho Marinov. The first to value the significant historical meaning was Dimitar Zlatarski, the creator of the Dalgopol Historical Museum. He was called by the locals to examine what they had found earlier that day. He realized how important the finding was, so he contacted the Varna Historical Museum and, after signing government papers, he handed over the research to the direction of Mihail Lazarov (1972‚Äì1976) and Ivan Ivanov (1972‚Äì1991). About 30% of the estimated necropolis area is still not excavated. A total of 294 graves have been found in the necropolis, New perspectives on the Varna cemetery (Bulgaria) , By: Higham, Tom; Chapman, John; Slavchev, Vladimir; Gaydarska, Bisserka; Honch, Noah; Yordanov, Yordan; Dimitrova, Branimira; 1 September 2007 many containing sophisticated examples of metallurgy (gold and copper), pottery (about 600 pieces, including gold- painted ones), high-quality flint and obsidian blades, beads, and shells. Varna necropolis, Grave offerings on exposition in Varna Museum Chronology The graves have been dated to 4569‚Äì4340 BC by radiocarbon dating in 2006 and belong to the Chalcolithic Varna culture, which is the local variant of the KGKVI. Burial rites A burial at Varna, with some of the world's oldest gold jewelry, dating back to 4,600 - 4,200 BC. There are crouched and straight inhumations. Some graves do not contain a skeleton, but grave gifts (cenotaphs). These symbolic (empty) graves are the richest in gold artifacts. Three thousand gold artifacts were found, with a weight of approximately six kilograms. Grave 43 contained more gold than has been found in the entire rest of the world for that epoch. Three symbolic graves contained masks of unbaked clay. The findings showed that the Varna culture had trade relations with distant lands (possibly including the lower Volga and the Cyclades), perhaps exporting metal goods and salt from the Provadiya rock salt mine. The copper ore used in the artifacts originated from a Sredna Gora mine near Stara Zagora, and Mediterranean Spondylus shells found in the graves may have served as primitive currency. The culture had sophisticated religious beliefs about afterlife and had developed hierarchical status differences. The site offers the oldest known burial evidence of an elite male (Marija Gimbutas claims that the end of the fifth millennium BC is the time that the transition to male dominance began in Europe). The high status male buried with the most remarkable amount of gold held a war adze or mace and wore a gold penis sheath. Bull-shaped gold platelets might also have venerated virility, instinctual force, and warfare. Gimbutas holds that the artifacts were made largely by local craftspeople. Historical impact According to M. Gimbutas (1991), \\"The discontinuity of the Varna, Karanovo, Vinƒça and Lengyel cultures in their main territories and the large scale population shifts to the north and northwest are indirect evidence of a catastrophe of such proportions that cannot be explained by possible climatic change, land exhaustion, or epidemics (for which there is no evidence in the second half of the 5th millennium B.C.). Direct evidence of the incursion of horse-riding warriors is found, not only in single burials of males under barrows, but in the emergence of a whole complex of Kurgan cultural traits.\\" According to J. Chapman (2005), \\"Once upon a time, not so very long ago, it was widely accepted that steppe nomads from the North Pontic zone invaded the Balkans, putting an end to the Climax Copper Age society that produced the apogee of tell living, autonomous copper metallurgy and, as the grandest climax, the Varna cemetery with its stunning early goldwork. Now the boot is very much on the other foot and it is the Varna complex and its associated communities that are held responsible for stimulating the onset of prestige goods-dominated steppe mortuary practice following the expansion of farming.\\" Among the metallic (gold and copper) and non-metallic (minerals, rocks, pottery, pigments, biofacts) artifacts in the graves from the Varna Chalcolithic site are numerous beads of a chalcedony (carnelian) and agate composition. Three main morphological types of beads are described: type 1 ‚Äì elongated barrel-shaped; type 2 ‚Äì elongated with trapezohedral facets; type 3 ‚Äì short cylindrical (Kostov, 2007; Kostov, Pelevina, 2008). The carnelian and related beads of type 2 have a \\"constant\\" number of 32 facets ‚Äì 16+16 on both sides on the elongation of the bead, which is considered probably the earliest in Chalcolithic complex faceting on such a hard mineral (hardness of chalcedony is 6.5‚Äì7 on the Mohs scale). In the hole of a single carnelian bead was found a gold mini-cylinder (~2x2 mm). The gold artifacts from the Varna Chalcolithic necropolis are assumed to be the \\"oldest gold of mankind\\" according to their total volume and quantity. Analysis of the measured weight of the different types of gold art–µfacts (beads, appliqu√©s, rings, bracelets, pectorals and diadems) revealed a weight system with at least two minimal weight units of ~0.14 and ~0.40 g among both mineral and gold beads (Kostov, 2004; 2007). The second one (=2 carats) was suggested as a basic \\"Chalcolithic unit\\" with the name van (from the first letters of Varna necropolis). Museum exhibitions Golden objects found in the necropolis. The artifacts can be seen at the Varna Archaeological Museum and at the National Historical Museum in Sofia. In 2006, some gold objects were included in a major and broadly advertised national exhibition of antique gold treasures in both Sofia and Varna. The Varna gold started touring the world in 1973; it was included in \\"The Gold of the Thracian Horseman\\" national exhibition, shown at many of the world's leading museums and exhibition venues in the 1970s. via- Met Publications In 1982, it was exhibited for 7 months in Japan as \\"The Oldest Gold in the World - The First European Civilization\\" with massive publicity, including two full length TV documentaries. In the 1980s and 1990s it was also shown in Canada, Germany, France, Italy, and Israel, among others, and featured in a cover story by the National Geographic Magazine. The Varna necropolis artifacts were shown for the first time in the United States in 1998 and 1999 as part of a major Bulgarian archaeological exhibition, Thracians' Riches: Treasures from Bulgaria. In 2009‚Äì2010, several artifacts were shown at the New York University Institute for the Study of the Ancient World in a joint Bulgarian-Romanian-Moldovan exhibition entitled The Lost World of Old Europe: The Danube Valley, 5000‚Äì3500 BC.The Lost World of Old Europe: The Danube Valley, 5000‚Äì3500 BC.

It is not clear when or why he adopted it, since some accounts of his dietary habits prior to the Second World War indicate that he consumed meat as late as 1937. By 1938, Hitler's public image as a vegetarian was already being fostered, and from 1942, he self-identified as a vegetarian. Personal accounts from people who knew Hitler and were familiar with his diet indicate that he did not consume meat as part of his diet during this period, as several contemporaneous witnesses‚Äîsuch as Albert Speer (in his memoirs, Inside the Third Reich)‚Äînoted that Hitler used vivid and gruesome descriptions of animal suffering and slaughter at the dinner table to try to dissuade his colleagues from eating meat. An examination of Hitler's remains carried out by French scientists in 2017 found no traces of meat fibre in the tartar on Hitler's teeth. Some modern-day analyses have speculated that Hitler's vegetarianism may have been for health reasons due to Richard Wagner's historical theories, or even a psychological reaction to his niece's death rather than a commitment to animal welfare. In contrast, several eyewitness sources maintain Hitler was a vegetarian because of his concern for animal suffering, noting that he was often distressed by images of animal cruelty and suffering, and was an antivivisectionist. Contemporary records In a 1937 article, The New York Times noted \\"It is well known that Hitler is a vegetarian and does not drink or smoke. His lunch and dinner consist, therefore, for the most part of soup, eggs, vegetables and mineral water, although he occasionally relishes a slice of ham and relieves the tediousness of his diet with such delicacies as caviar ...\\".(New York Times Article: 'At Home with the Fuhrer.' 30 May 1937. Otto D. Tolschuss (1937). \\"Where Hitler Dreams and Plans\\" - New York Times, 30 May 1937) In November 1938, an article for the English magazine Homes & Gardens describing Hitler's mountain home, The Berghof, stated that in addition to being a teetotaler and a non-smoker, Hitler was also a vegetarian. Ignatius Phayre wrote, \\"A life-long vegetarian at table, Hitler's kitchen plots are both varied and heavy in produce. Even in his meatless diet Hitler is something of a gourmet -- as Sir John Simon and Anthony Eden were surprised to note when they dined with him in the Chancellery at Berlin. His Bavarian chef, Herr Kannenberg, contrives an imposing array of vegetarian dishes, savoury and rich, pleasing to the eye as well as to the palate, and all conforming to the dietic standards which Hitler exacts.\\" According to stenographic transcripts translated by Hugh Trevor-Roper of conversations between Hitler and his inner circle which took place between July 1941 and November 1944, Hitler regarded himself as a vegetarian. These conversations were gathered together under the title Hitler's Table Talk. Written notes taken at the time were transcribed and then were edited by Martin Bormann. According to these transcripts dated 11 November 1941, Hitler said, \\"One may regret living at a period when it's impossible to form an idea of the shape the world of the future will assume. But there's one thing I can predict to eaters of meat: the world of the future will be vegetarian.\\" On 12 January 1942, he said, \\"The only thing of which I shall be incapable is to share the sheiks' mutton with them. I'm a vegetarian, and they must spare me from their meat.\\" In a diary entry dated 26 April 1942, Joseph Goebbels described Hitler as a committed vegetarian, writing, In his table talks, on 25 April 1942 at midday, Hitler addressed the issue of vegetarianism and spoke about Roman soldiers eating fruits and cereals and the importance of raw vegetables. He placed the emphasis on scientific arguments such as naturalists' observations and chemical efficacy.Hitler, A., & Cameron, Norman (2000). Hitler's Table Talk. Enigma Books. Hitler also disapproved of cosmetics, since they contained animal by-products, and he frequently teased Eva Braun about her habit of wearing makeup. Braun was also fond of turtle soup and notes from the interrogation of Hitler's personal aides about his daily routine in 1944 reveal that after midnight she would \\"direct that there should be another light snack of turtle soup, sandwiches, and sausages\\".(The Hitler Book: The Secret Dossier Prepared for Stalin from the Interrogations of Hitler's Personal Aides Audio CD ‚Äì Audiobook, CD, Unabridged by Henrik Eberle (Author), Matthias Uhl (Author), and Michael Prichard (Narrator) p.136) Personal testimony and second hand accounts All accounts by people familiar with Hitler's diet from 1942 onwards are in agreement that Hitler adhered to a vegetarian diet, but accounts of his diet prior to the Second World War are inconsistent in this regard with some stating he ate meat. Dione Lucas, a chef at a Hamburg hotel patronised by Hitler prior to the war, claimed that her stuffed squab was a favourite of his.Dione Lucas (1964). The Gourmet Cooking School Cookbook. p. 89 According to Ilse Hess (wife of Rudolf Hess), in 1937, Hitler ceased eating meat except for liver dumplings. Margot W√∂lk, who became his unwilling food taster in 1942, stated that all the food she tested for Hitler was vegetarian, and she recalled no meat or fish.Bitter memories linger of life as Hitler's food taster, The New Zealand Herald, 21 September 2014, Accessed 20 September 2014 from USA This account was backed up in 2017 when Russia's Federal Security Service granted permission to a team of French scientists to undertake an examination of Hitler's bones. An analysis of the tartar deposits found on the F√ºhrer's teeth and dentures found no traces of meat fibre. Traudl Junge, who became Hitler's secretary in 1942, reported that he \\"always avoided meat\\" but that his Austrian cook Kruemel sometimes added a little animal broth or fat to his meals. \\"Mostly the Fuehrer would notice the attempt at deception, would get very annoyed and then get tummy ache,\\" Junge said. \\"At the end he would only let Kruemel cook him clear soup and mashed potato.\\" In addition, Marlene von Exner, who became Hitler's dietitian in 1943, reportedly added bone marrow to his soups without his knowledge because she \\"despised\\" his vegetarian diet. Even though Hitler adhered to a vegetarian diet during this period, his physician, Theodor Morell, administered many unorthodox medications that contained animal by- products from 1936 until Hitler's death in 1945. These included Glyconorm (an injectable compound containing cardiac muscle, adrenal gland, liver, and pancreas), placenta, bovine testosterone, and extracts containing seminal vesicles and prostate. At the time, extracts from animal glands were popularly believed to be \\"elixirs of youth\\", but it is not known if Hitler requested them or if he blindly accepted them. Analysis Prior to the Second World War, there are many accounts of Hitler's eating meat (including stuffed squab and Bavarian sausages) and caviar.(Payne Robert: The Life and Death of Adolf Hitler, (New York: Praeger, 1973), pp. 346-7) According to Ilse Hess, in 1937 Hitler ceased eating all meat except for liver dumplings, an account that Dr. Kalechofsky found \\"consistent with other descriptions of Hitler's diet, which always included some form of meat, whether ham, sausages or liver dumplings.\\"(Kalechofsky, op. cit., p.2. / Toland, op cit., p.826) Frau Hess's comments are also backed up by several biographies about Hitler, with Fritz Redlich noting that Hitler \\"avoided any kind of meat, with the exception of an Austrian dish he loved, Leberkn√∂dl (liver dumpling)\\".(Fritz Redlich M.D, Hitler: Diagnosis of a Destructive Prophet (Oxford: OUP, 1998), pp.77-8) Thomas Fuchs concurred, observing that a \\"typical day's consumption included eggs prepared in any number of ways, spaghetti, baked potatoes with cottage cheese, oatmeal, stewed fruits and vegetable puddings. Meat was not completely excluded. Hitler continued to eat a favourite dish, Leberkloesse (liver dumplings).\\" (Thomas Fuchs (2000). A Concise Biography of Adolf Hitler. New York: Berkley Books. p.78) Today, it is acknowledged by historians that Hitler‚Äîat least during the war‚Äîfollowed a vegetarian diet. Several theories have been put forward for Hitler's transition to vegetarianism. The psychoanalyst, Erich Fromm speculated that Hitler's vegetarianism was actually a means of atoning for the death of his half-niece Geli Raubal, as well as a means of proving to himself and others that he was incapable of killing. British historical biographer Robert Payne, in his book The Life and Death of Adolph Hitler (Praeger, 1973) believed that Hitler's diet was ascetic and deliberately fostered by propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels to emphasize Hitler's self-control and total dedication to Germany. Rynn Berry‚Äîan authority on vegetarian history‚Äîsupported the notion that Hitler's vegetarianism was \\"a marketing scheme concocted by Nazi propagandists\\" who wished to create a better public perception of Hitler, and was mostly due to health reasons rather than moral ones (noting his fondness for liver dumplings), concluding that \\"Hitler was in no way an ethical vegetarian\\". Other evidence suggests that Hitler‚Äîalso an antivivisectionist‚Äîmay have followed his selective diet out of a profound concern for animals. At social events, he sometimes gave graphic accounts of the slaughter of animals in an effort to make his dinner guests shun meat. In the BBC series The Nazis: A Warning from History, an eyewitness account tells of Hitler watching movies (which he did very often). If ever a scene showed (even fictional) cruelty to or death of an animal, Hitler would cover his eyes and look away until someone alerted him the scene was over. Alexander Cockburn also wrote of Hitler: It has also been theorized that Hitler's diet may have been based on Richard Wagner's historical theoriesProctor 1999, p. 136. \\"Several of [Hitler's] biographers point to the influence of nationalist antisemitic composer, Richard Wagner.\\" See also: Moore, Gregory. (2002). Nietzsche, Biology and Metaphor. Cambridge University Press. . pp. 155-157: which connected the future of Germany with vegetarianism.Arluke & Sanders 1996, pp. 144, 150. In the book, The Mind of Adolf Hitler by psychologist Walter C. Langer, the author speculates: Despite Hitler's plans to convert Germany to vegetarianism after the war, some authors have questioned Hitler's commitment to the vegetarian cause due to the Nazi ban on vegetarian societies and the persecution of their leaders. However, the Nazi ban of non-Nazi organizations was widespread: all opposition political parties were banned, independent trade unions were replaced by Nazi equivalents, while non-government organizations and associations ranging from women's groups to film societies were either dissolved or incorporated into new organizations under the control of the Nazi leadership. The Nazi regime also introduced animal welfare laws which were unparalleled at the time.

She served in a commissioned status from 1945‚Äì1959, and 1965-1975. She was named for a river in Mississippi. Noxubee was designed to replenish shore bases and ships. In addition she carried a limited quantity of light freight and provisions, and was capable of replenishing ships at sea. Although designated a gasoline tanker she frequently carried a split cargo of aviation gasoline, motor gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, and Navy Special Fuel Oil. 1945-1959 Noxubee was built by Cargill, Incorporated, Savage, Minnesota. Her keel was laid 17 November 1944. She was launched on 3 April 1945, under the sponsorship of Mrs. Wilbur F. Bagley of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Mrs. Bagley, representing the shipyard workers, was the wife of a veteran Cargill employee. Their son, Sergeant Wilbur L. Bagley, USMC had given his life for his country in the Solomon Islands. Noxubee had a length of 310 feet, 10 inches; extreme beam, 48 feet 7 inches; displacement of 4,160 tons; draft, 15 feet, 0 inches; and a top speed of 14 knots. Her original complement was 8 officers and 116 men. When first commissioned she was armed with four 3-inch 50 caliber guns. Her cargo capacity was 680,000 gallons of petroleum products, approximately 2000 tons. Noxubee commissioned at Algiers, Louisiana, 19 October 1945, Lieutenant John Lande, USNR, commanding. Noxubee departed New Orleans on 6 November 1945, for shakedown training in the Gulf of Mexico operating out of Galveston, Texas. On 12 January 1946 she began the first of two round trips to Bermuda. On 26 February, she put to sea from Galena, Texas bound for Trinidad and Guantanamo Bay and then to a re-fueling rendezvous with fleet tugs and . On 2 April, she arrived at Bermuda for a three-day stay. Departing Bermuda she steamed north for Philadelphia, Norfolk, and then on to NS Argentia, Newfoundland, and back to Norfolk. In the following months, Noxubee continued to operate out of Norfolk, transporting petroleum products to Argentia, Newfoundland; Goose Bay, Labrador; the Azores and Iceland. On 16 November 1947, Newport, Rhode Island, became her base of operations. From there she shuttled gasoline and oil to bases in Greenland and Newfoundland, and even made a few trips south to Texas and other Gulf States. From 6 March to 3 April 1950, Noxubee crossed the Atlantic from Newport with a liquid cargo for Casablanca, French Morocco, returning to Norfolk. A similar voyage was made from 23 January to 5 March 1951, with Naples, Italy added to her itinerary. After returning home, she made trips to Bermuda, Cuba, and to Newfoundland. She once again departed Norfolk 14 July, this time for duty with the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean. Noxubee was based in Tripoli, Libya and replenished units of the Sixth Fleet in ports of Italy, France, Greece, Algiers and Malta. She departed Tripoli on 20 April 1952 and arrived in New York on 4 May. Following a period of upkeep in the Norfolk and Boston Naval Shipyards, Noxubee was based at Newport until 12 March 1953, when she again sailed to join the Sixth Fleet. She operated out of Tripoli and traveled to the principal Mediterranean ports visited by the Sixth Fleet. Noxubee departed Marseilles, France on 28 September, and returned to Norfolk 14 October. Noxubee then spent nearly four months at Newport. She sailed as replenishment station ship for a short-range craft convoy en route to the Azores via Bermuda. She returned to Newport on 26 March 1954, and was overhauled in the Boston Naval Shipyard from 29 April to 1 July 1954. She again departed Newport 3 September, to serve with the Sixth Fleet. Noxubee was based at Tripoli until 24 January 1955, when she departed Gibraltar for Newport on 5 February. After a training cruise to Cuba and Puerto Rico, she again departed Newport 19 August, for another tour in the Mediterranean, serving there until 3 December. Noxubee arrived in Newport from Gibraltar on 14 December 1955. After traveling 23,775 miles in 1955, she was overhauled in the Boston Naval Shipyard and on 21 May 1956, she again put to sea, bound for Tripoli, Libya, to serve Sixth Fleet and NATO Fleet units in the Mediterranean. She returned home to Newport on 29 October. Noxubee departed Newport on 6 May 1957 for duty as station tanker with a convoy of minesweepers bound for the Azores. She returned on 6 June, was overhauled in the Boston Naval Shipyard, then made a refresher training cruise to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Noxubee returned north to Newport on 30 March 1958, ranging south to Bermuda and north to Maine before she again sailed from Newport on 8 September with a convoy en route via Bermuda to the Azores, returning 29 September. Noxubee departed 2 January 1959 for Green Cove Springs, Florida and deactivation. She was decommissioned on 6 March 1959, and was assigned to the Florida Group, U.S. Atlantic Reserve Fleet until her name was struck from the Navy List on 1 July 1960. Noxubee was transferred to the Maritime Administration until placed on the Navy List for activation in 1965. 1965-1970 On 10 September 1966, following a seven-month outfitting and modernization period at Baltimore, Noxubee was recommissioned at Norfolk Naval Shipyard, LT Howard Pabst commanding. One month later she sailed for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii via the Panama Canal as a unit of Service Squadron Five. Following refresher training at Pearl Harbor, Noxubee deployed to the western Pacific on 9 March 1967. During that deployment she supported advanced fuel bases along the coast of I Corps, South Vietnam. On 2 August 1967, Noxubee departed Da Nang for Sasebo and Yokosuka, Japan. During her return trip to Pearl Harbor Noxubee was diverted to Wake Island to assist in the salvage of a grounded civilian tanker. She finally arrived at Pearl Harbor on 22 September 1967. While conducting a training cruise off the coast of Oahu on 24 November, Noxubee spotted and rescued the sole survivor of a fishing boat accident. On 17 April 1968, Noxubee departed Hawaii for her second WESTPAC cruise. Noxubee headed directly for Vietnam for three months of continuous operations. In August Noxubee received the Battle Efficiency Pennant for fiscal year 1968. On 28 October, Noxubee came under enemy artillery fire while anchored off C·ª≠a Vi·ªát, escaping unharmed. During this deployment Noxubee set the all-time record for AOGs by pumping 20 million gallons of petroleum products and earning a Meritorious Unit Commendation. Noxubee returned to Pearl Harbor in December 1968. Following six months of upkeep and training Noxubee again departed Pearl Harbor for Vietnam on 2 June 1969 with LT D. E. Cass commanding. Operating out of Da Nang, she made frequent trips to Sa Huynh, Tan My and C·ª≠a Vi·ªát. On 9 September 1969 Noxubee was mined by enemy swimmers while anchored at C·ª≠a Vi·ªát. The explosion created a three by five-foot hole in her hull but the crew suffered no casualties. Temporary repairs were quickly accomplished at Da Nang and she was back on station in less than a week. At the end of the month Noxubee traveled to Subic Bay for permanent repairs. In addition to Subic Bay, Noxubee also visited Hong Kong and Sasebo, Japan during this deployment. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 6 February 1970. 1970-1975 Noxubee departed Pearl Harbor on 18 May 1970 for her new homeport at Little Creek, Virginia and duty with Service Squadron Eight. The trip to the east coast included stops at Long Beach, California, Acapulco, Mexico, and the Panama Canal. Noxubee deployed for five months in the Mediterranean on 28 December 1970 still under the command of LCDR Cass. Her duties centered around Amphibious Task Force 61 with occasional replenishments of other Sixth Fleet ships. She also accomplished one month's surveillance of the Soviet Union Mediterranean Fleet. Upon return to Little Creek Noxubee undertook a major overhaul at the Brambleton plant of Norfolk Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company. After completion of the overhaul and refresher training, Noxubee again deployed for the Mediterranean. Noxubee refueled ships ranging from LPH to PG types, pumping some 3,881,078 gallons of fuel. In May and July, the ship participated in exercises Dawn Patrol and National Week. Although primarily assigned to service Amphibious Task Force 61, Noxubee re-fueled destroyers throughout the Mediterranean. Port visits included Rota and Barcelona, Spain; Naples, Italy; Athens, Corfu, and Thera, Greece and the French Riviera. Noxubee returned to Little Creek on 14 August. After returning home the ship provided refueling services to units of the Mine Force off Charleston, South Carolina. On two separate occasions during December 1972 Noxubee was assigned to refuel destroyers on Atlantic Ocean station. During the first half of 1973 Noxubee underwent an RAV (Restricted Availability Period) during which many repairs were made. Upon completion of the RAV the ship conducted underway replenishment operations off the Eastern Coast of the U.S., as well as a refresher training period. These operations included the refueling of four destroyers and ten minesweepers In 1973, LT Michael Mullen, USN assumed command of Noxubee. Mullen would eventually attain the rank of Admiral, would eventually become Chief of Naval Operations and ultimately the US military's senior ranking officer as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.http://ebird.osd.mil/ebfiles/e20081228647198.html During Mullen's command, Noxubee collided with a buoy in the Chesapeake.\\"Mullen: Learn From Mistakes and Move On.\\" Donna Miles, American Forces Press Service Sept. 22, 2011. https://archive.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=65424 On 6 June 1973, Noxubee sailed for operations with the Sixth Fleet. During this cruise Noxubee provided support for 55 ships of three nations. Port visits included Istanbul and ƒ∞zmir Turkey, Athens, Corfu, and Thera, Greece and Naples, Italy. Noxubee returned to Little Creek in November. From December 1973, to May 1974, Noxubee underwent an RAV period. After a training cruise to Bermuda and the Bahamas, Noxubee departed for the Mediterranean on 4 October 1974 for her final deployment to the Sixth Fleet. Noxubee visited 13 foreign ports and transferred over 5 million gallons of fuel while traveling over 17,000 miles. On 11 April 1975, Noxubee returned to Little Creek, Virginia for the last time. Over the next ten weeks Noxubee was stripped of all salvageable gear and prepared for decommissioning. The decommissioning ceremony was held at Pier 12 Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek, Virginia. At 1400 hours 1 July 1975, Noxubee was officially stricken from the list of active US Naval Ships.  Military awards and honors  Noxubee was awarded six campaign stars for Vietnam War service: * Vietnam Counteroffensive - Phase II * Vietnam Counteroffensive - Phase III * Vietnam Counteroffensive - Phase IV * Vietnam Counteroffensive - Phase V * Vietnam Summer-Fall 1969 * Vietnam Winter-Spring 1970 Noxubee‚Äôs crew was eligible for the following medals, ribbons, and commendations (shown in order of precedence): * Combat Action Ribbon (28 Oct.1968 and 9 Sept. 1969) * Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation * Battle \\"E\\" Ribbon * American Campaign Medal * World War II Victory Medal * Navy Occupation Service Medal (with Europe Clasp) * National Defense Service Medal * Vietnam Service Medal (6) * Republic of Vietnam Meritorious Unit Commendation (5) * Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal References * *This article includes text from the USS Noxubee Webpage .

It supplemented the earlier deception offences contained in sections 15 and 16 of the Theft Act 1968 by reforming some aspects of those offences and adding new provisions. See also the Fraud Act 2006.Fraud Act 2006 commentary Section 1 - Obtaining services by deception This section created the offence of obtaining services by deception. It was repealed on 15 January 2007 by Schedule 3 to the Fraud Act 2006. As amended by the Theft (Amendment) Act 1996, it read: :(1) A person who by any deception dishonestly obtains services from another shall be guilty of an offence. :(2) It is an obtaining of services where the other is induced to confer a benefit by doing some act, or causing or permitting some act to be done, on the understanding that the benefit has been or will be paid for. :(3) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (2) above, it is an obtaining of services where the other is induced to make a loan, or to cause or permit a loan to be made, on the understanding that any payment (whether by way of interest or otherwise) will be or has been made in respect of the loan. There must be a deception which, according to section 5(1), has the same meaning as in section 15(4) of the Theft Act 1968, i.e. any deception (whether deliberate or reckless) by words or conduct as to fact or as to law, including a deception as to the present intentions of the person using the deception or any other person. This deception must be the cause of the obtaining (see the discussion on causation in Deception (criminal law) and Obtaining property by deception#By any deception). The defendant must obtain a service as defined in section 1(2), i.e. the victim must confer a benefit on the defendant (or another). The 'services' must be non-gratuitous, i.e. the benefits must be provided by the victim of the deception in the expectation that they are to be paid for at commercial rates (see section 1(2)). It must be conferred by the doing, causing, or permitting of some act. A failure to act that confers a benefit is not sufficient. Thus, a person who employs a lawyer or accountant without ever intending to pay, may commit an offence under section 1. But a person who lies to a neighbour to secure the loan of a power drill does not commit an offence because the benefit is not obtained on the understanding that it has been or will be paid for. In R v Halai [1983] Crim LR 624, CA, the defendant made false statements in an application for a mortgage and thereby obtained a survey, the opening of an account and a mortgage advance. Note that the Theft (Amendment) Act 1996 introduced section 1(3) specifically to provide that a loan amounts to a service. This dispenses with that part of the decision in Halai (which had, in any event, been overruled by R v GrahamR v Graham (H K), R v Kansal, R v Ali (Sajid), R v Marsh and others [1997] 1 Cr App R 302, CA prior to the Act) As to the opening of an account, contrast R v Shortland [1995] Crim LR 893 in which the Court of Appeal held that, on the evidence presented, opening bank accounts under false names did not amount to the section 1 offence, but suggested that it might have done if evidence that it had to be paid for had been presented. The mens rea for all offences is dishonesty. A person could commit this offence by obtaining services for another person.R v Nathan (Ronald Stephen) [1997] Crim LR 835, CA As to obtaining of hire-purchase agreements, see R v Widdowson, 82 Cr App R 314, [1986] RTR 124, [1986] Crim LR 233, CA The following cases are also relevant: *R v Teong Sun Chuah and Teong Tatt Chuah [1991] Crim LR 463, CA *R v Cooke (David) [1997] Crim LR 436, [1997] 4 CL 187, 3 Archbold News 2, CA *R v Cummings-John [1997] Crim LR 660 *R v Naviede [1997] Crim LR 662, CA Liability for offences by corporations Section 18 of the Theft Act 1968 applied in relation to this section as it applied in relation to section 15 of the Theft Act 1968.The Theft Act 1978, section 5(1) Mode of trial and sentence This offence was triable either way.The Theft Act 1978, section 4(1) A person guilty of this offence was liable, on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years,The Theft Act 1978, section 4(2)(a) or, on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to a fine not exceeding the prescribed sum, or to both.The Theft Act 1978, section 4(3) Section 2 - Evasion of liability by deception This section created the offence of evasion of liability by deception. It was repealed on 15 January 2007 by Schedule 3 to the Fraud Act 2006. It read: :(1) Subject to subsection (2) below, where a person by any deception ::(a) dishonestly secures the remission of the whole or part of any existing liability to make a payment, whether his own liability or another's; or ::(b) with intent to make permanent default in whole or in part on any existing liability to make a payment, or with intent to let another do so, dishonestly induces the creditor or any person claiming payment on behalf of the creditor to wait for payment (whether or not the due date for payment is deferred) or to forgo payment; or ::(c) dishonestly obtains any exemption from or abatement of liability to make a payment; :he shall be guilty of an offence. :(2) For the purposes of this section 'liability' means legally enforceable liability; and subsection (1) shall not apply in relation to a liability that has not been accepted or established to pay compensation for a wrongful act or omission.\\" :(3) For purposes of subsection (1)(b) a person induced to take in payment a cheque or other security for money by way of conditional satisfaction of a pre-existing liability is to be treated not as being paid but as being induced to wait for payment. :(4) For purposes of subsection (1)(c) \\"obtains\\" includes obtaining for another or enabling another to obtain. Section 2(1) is divided into three parts, all of which require that both a deception caused the obtaining, which may be for oneself or for another, and that there is a legally enforceable liability. All three also require proof that the creditor is deceived into releasing the defendant from the obligation to pay in some way. (Contrast the previous law represented by Director of Public Prosecutions v RayDirector of Public Prosecutions v Ray [1974] AC 370, [1973] 3 WLR 359, [1973] 3 All ER 131, 117 SJ 663, 58 Cr App R 130, sub nom Ray v Sempers [1974] Crim LR 181, HL, reversing sub nom Ray v Sempers [1973] 1 WLR 317 which, for policy reasons, held that merely running out of a restaurant without positively deceiving someone was nevertheless an offence. As to the meaning of the words \\"with intent to make permanent default in whole or in part of any existing liability to make a payment\\" in section 2(1)(b), see R v Attewell-Hughes [1991] 1 WLR 955, [1991] 4 All ER 810, 93 Cr App R 132, [1991] Crim LR 437, CA. See also R v Andrews and Hedges [1981] Crim LR 106. Liability for offences by corporations Section 18 of the Theft Act 1968 applied in relation to this section as it applied in relation to section 15 of the Theft Act 1968.The Theft Act 1978, section 5(1) =Remission of a debt= Section 2(1)(a) covers the deception that dishonestly secures the remission of the whole or part of an existing liability to make a payment. Unlike the other two subsections, this requires that the victim knows a liability exists, and knows how much they are remitting. It does not cover situations where the defendant tricks the victim into believing that no money is owed (sections 2(1)(b) and (c) do cover this situation). If A borrows ¬£50 from B and, when repayment is due, claims that a change of circumstances makes it impossible for him to repay some or all of the money; this deception persuades B to forgive the loan, or to accept ¬£10 in full satisfaction.CLRC 1977, para. 13 In R v Jackson,[1983] Crim LR 617, 147 JP 715, CA Jackson tendered a stolen credit card to pay for petrol and other goods, and it was accepted by a trader, who then looked to the issuing credit card company for payment and not to the person tendering the card. This was held to dishonestly secure the remission of an existing liability and Jackson was convicted. For these purposes, the existing liability to make a payment may be the defendant's own liability or another's. The provisions of section 2(2) clarify that section 2(1) does not apply where the liability has not been \\"accepted or established to pay compensation for a wrongful act or omission\\". This avoids the criminal law being a default liability for civil proceedings. Thus, if X lies about an accident to avoid a claim of negligence, no offence is committed. The claimant can commence civil proceedings once the deception is discovered.CLRC 1977, para. 16 =Delaying payment of a debt= Like section 2(1)(a), this requires an existing liability to make payment but, unlike (a), it does not require that the creditor knows they are \\"letting the defendant off\\". In R v Holt and Lee,R v Holt and Lee [1981] 1 WLR 1000, [1981] 2 All ER 854, 125 SJ 373, 73 Cr App R 96, [1981] Crim LR 499, CA the defendants ate a meal in a restaurant that cost ¬£3.65. When presented with the bill, they claimed another waitress had already taken a ¬£5 note from the table. Unfortunately, an off-duty policeman had overheard their planning. They were both convicted of an attempt by deception to induce the creditor to forego payment with intent to make permanent default. Their appeal against conviction was dismissed. The section is also concerned with dishonestly inducing a creditor to wait for payment. In many circumstances, this means that sections 2(1)(a) and (b) will overlap, but there are also situations in which they do not. Thus, creditors who remit will also forgo. A particular instance of \\"wait for payment\\" is provided by section 2(3), which was a necessary amendment because of the general principle that accepting a cheque (even a worthless cheque) as the means of payment, means that, until the creditor receives notice that the cheque has been dishonoured, they stop seeking payment: see R v Hammond.R v Hammond [1982] Crim LR 611, CA Section 2(3) provides that a person induced to take a cheque or other security for money by way of conditional satisfaction of an existing liability is to be treated not as being paid but as being induced to wait for payment. As mens rea, the defendant must make the deception with intent to make permanent default in whole or in part on any existing liability to make a payment of his own, or with intent to let another do so. =Avoiding incurring a debt= For there to be an offence under section 2(1)(c) there must be dishonesty and a deception that obtains some exemption from or abatement of liability to make a payment. Because both sections 2(1)(a) and (b) require an \\"existing\\" liability to pay, they do not cover situations where the point of the deception is to prevent a liability from arising in the future. Section 2(1)(c) would apply when a person flags down a taxi and claims only to have ¬£5. The driver agrees to carry the passenger to the destination for this amount. The contract is made for a reduced amount, which is an \\"abatement\\" for these purposes. If the driver agreed to carry for no charge, this would be an \\"exemption\\". The Criminal Law Revision Committee (CLRC) gave examples where the defendant dishonestly obtained a rate rebate or a reduction in rent for the future. Another example would be waving a credit card at a ticket collector at a railway station to avoid having to pay to board the train. In roader than previous two offences as not limited to existing liabilities. In R v Firth,R v Firth, 91 Cr App R 217, [1990] Crim LR 326, CA the defendant failed to tell the NHS that patients using NHS facilities were in fact private patients thereby obtaining facilities without payment (an example of an omission or silence constituting the deception). In R v Sibartie [1983] Crim LR 470, CA, the defendant was convicted of attempting section 2(1)(c) when he deceived a ticket collector on the underground into believing that he had paid for the whole of his journey. In fact, he had only purchased tickets for the first few and last few stations in his journey. The court of first instance said that that was a dishonest attempt to obtain an exemption from the liability to pay the excess. On appeal, it was argued that this was an attempt to induce the creditor to forgo payment of part under section 2(1)(b). The Court of Appeal held that although this illustrated the overlap between section 2(1)(b) and section 2(1)(c), it did not make liability under section 2(1)(c) wrong. =Mode of trial and sentence= This offence was triable either way.The Theft Act 1978, section 4(1) A person guilty of this offence was liable, on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years,The Theft Act 1978, section 4(2)(a) or, on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to a fine not exceeding the prescribed sum, or to both.The Theft Act 1978, section 4(3) Section 3 - Making off without payment This section creates the offence of making off without payment. It provides: :(1) Subject to subsection (3) below, a person who, knowing that payment on the spot for any goods supplied or service done is required or expected from him, dishonestly makes off without having paid as required or expected and with intent to avoid payment of the amount due shall be guilty of an offence. :(2) For purposes of this section 'payment on the spot' includes payment at the time of collecting goods on which work has been done, or in respect of which service has been provided. :(3) Subsection (1) above shall not apply where the supply of the goods or the doing of the service is contrary to law, or where the service done is such that payment is not legally enforceable. The following subsection was repealed by the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005: :(4) Any person may arrest without warrant anyone who is, or whom he, with reasonable cause, suspects to be, committing or attempting to commit an offence under this section.\\" This offence is triable either way.The Theft Act 1978, section 4(1) A person guilty of this offence is liable, on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years,The Theft Act 1978, section 4(2)(b) or, on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to a fine not exceeding the prescribed sum, or to both.The Theft Act 1978, section 4(3) In R v Allen, the House of Lords said that, in order for the offence to be committed, there must be \\"an intention to permanently deprive\\" by making off, and that a mere \\"intention to defer\\" payment is not sufficient. In theory, a person could eat a meal at a restaurant, not pay, but leave his name and address in order for the restaurant to start civil recovery procedures against him - as long as the details were correct, and he did intend to pay at some point in the future (by way of civil recovery) then no offence under Section 3 would be committed. Section 4 - Punishments Section 4(2)(a) was repealed on 15 January 2007 by Schedule 3 to the Fraud Act 2006. Section 5 - Supplementary Section 5(1) was repealed on 15 January 2007 by Schedule 3 to the Fraud Act 2006. Section 5(3) was repealed by section 37(1) of, and Schedule 2 to, the Extradition Act 1989. Section 6 - Enactment of the same provisions for Northern Ireland See the Theft (Northern Ireland) Order 1978 (S.I. 1978/1407 (N.I. 23)). Section 7 - Short title, commencement and extent Section 7(2) provides that the Act came into force at the end of the period of three months that began on the date on which it was passed. The word \\"months\\" means calendar months.The Interpretation Act 1978, section 5 and Schedule 1 The day (that is to say, 20 July 1978) on which the Act was passed (that is to say, received royal assent) is included in the period of three months.Hare v Gocher [1962] 2 QB 641, [1962] 2 All ER 673; Trow v Ind Coope (West Midlands) Ltd [1967] 2 QB 899 at 909, [1967] 2 All ER 900, CA.

It was released in Japan on October 20, 2005, in North America on March 6, 2006, in Australia on April 28, 2006, and in Europe on May 5, 2006. Gameplay Pok√©mon Trozei! has gameplay similar to both Tetris and Yoshi's Cookie. The blocks are symbols shaped like various Pok√©mon. These blocks fall onto both screens; however, only the blocks on the bottom screen can be moved and matched. The player can move the blocks to the left and right, and the Pok√©mon that was moved off the edge of the screen returns to the opposite side of the screen. The blocks can also be moved downward, and the blocks on the bottom will fall to the top of the column. The blocks can be moved upwards, but will immediately fall back down if a match is not made. If four of the same Pok√©mon are in a row, a match is made and those Pok√©mon will disappear. After a match of four is created, a Trozei Chance (or Link Chance) Icon will come up. When that happens, match-ups of three Pok√©mon are allowed for a short amount of time, normally two seconds. If a match of three is made during that time, match-ups of two Pok√©mon are allowed as well for as long as the player continues to make links every two seconds. The Pok√©mon Ditto will also commonly appear as a block, and the player can use it as a \\"wild card\\" and match it with any other Pok√©mon, or even with multiple types simultaneously. Lining up Jammer balls (rocks) with Ditto is the only way to get rid of them during boss stages. While Ditto appears randomly during levels, one also drops when the player links up more Pok√©mon than needed (e.g. 5 instead of 4) in general play. =Phobos Battalion= The Phobos Battalion is the new enemy of this game. They have stolen countless Pok√© Balls in order to power up a secret weapon. Unlike most Pok√©mon villains, there are only generals in the game, no underlings. They have many secret storages and huge storage (that contain many more Pok√©mon than the secret storages) and six Phobos Mobiles, each containing a General that the player must defeat in order to move on. The region Pok√©mon Trozei! takes place in is unknown. This game features Pok√©mon from Kanto, Johto and Hoenn. Lucy Fleetfoot is working under Professor P, who is the top agent of SOL (the Secret Operation League). SOL is represented by a Solrock, while the Phobos Battalion is represented by a Lunatone. There are four different Styles of stages in the Adventure mode: Research, Storage, Phobos Mobiles, and Mr. Who's Den. The first of these, Research, is a training mode designed to show the player the basic method of play, and to show them helpful tricks. Players set out with two partners, Aipom and Manectric, and are equipped with the Trozei Beamer invented by Prof. P. After the player sneaks into the enemy's fortress, they seek out the Pok√©balls and scans them with x-rays from their Beamer. The Beamer will transfer 4 (or 2 and 3 later) identical Pok√©mon back to Prof. P at SOL each time, and this explains the gameplay of lining up the Pok√©mon icons in the game fields. The Storage levels, which come in two varieties (Secret Storage and Huge Storage), are \\"normal\\" levels where the goal is to link up the required number of Pok√©mon. The two types of Storage levels differ only in the number of Pok√©mon that must be linked. The Phobos Mobiles are the \\"boss fights\\" where the player has to beat the Generals of the Phobos Battalion at games of Trozei. The Phobos Mobiles are the Phobos Train, the Phobos Jet, the Phobos Drill, the Phobos Sub and the Phobos Walker. During these games, the \\"opponent\\" does a variety of things. A plain white ball or rock, known as a Jammer Ball, can be inserted as a tile, which does not match with any Pok√©mon except Ditto. The screen can lose its color, so only the silhouettes of the Pok√©mon can be seen until a link is made. If the player is very close to winning (less than 10), the \\"opponent\\" can add 50 to the number of Pok√©mon left needed to be linked. Mr. Who's Den is a sort of \\"bonus level\\" where rare Pok√©mon appear more often, and the playfield is also two columns wider than normal. The player must pay a Prize Coin to play there, and games are timed at two minutes (plus allowing the current Trozei Chance to end) rather than ending after a certain number of Pok√©mon have been cleared. Once the original adventure mode is completed, the Trozei Hard Adventure can be accessed. =Endless Mode= As the name suggests, this mode continues until the play area is completely filled with pieces. It is divided into many levels. The player can start on any level which is a multiple of 5 that they have cleared already, and before reaching level 25, they can start from 1, 5, 10, 15 or 20. The maximum level is greater than 145 and likely goes well beyond that, if not without a final level at all (hence the name \\"Endless Mode\\"). The player completes a level when they clear the necessary amount of Pok√©mon. When the level changes, the common and rare Pok√©mon also change. =Forever Mode= This mode is similar to Endless. However, the player must Trozei five Pok√©mon first, then four, etc. The Pok√©mon fall faster than in Endless and the setup is exactly the same as Mr. Who's den; it has the exact layout of the Den but the same rules as Endless. Forever mode is intended to be a harder challenge than Endless mode due to these small changes, and it is likely that it too never ends, regardless of how many levels the players completes (hence being given the name \\"Forever Mode\\"). =Pok√©dex= Pok√©mon Trozei! has a side mission of completing the National Dex. To get a Pok√©mon's entry, the player must Trozei a Pok√©mon in any mode. Sequel During the Nintendo Direct on February 13, 2014, Nintendo announced the sequel to Pok√©mon Trozei! that would be released exclusively on the Nintendo 3DS eShop. The game (titled Pok√©mon Battle Trozei in North America and Pok√©mon Link Battle in Europe) was released in March 2014 for Japan, Europe and North America. Reception Pok√©mon Trozei! was given an 8.25 out of 10 by Game Informer for being \\"both charming and challenging enough that even those nauseated by the thought of Pok√©mon should really pick it up anyway.\\" Nintendo Power, which awarded the game an 8.5 out of 10, echoed that sentiment, stating it's \\"a stylish game that's a blast whether or not you're a fan [of Pok√©mon]\\". Alex Lucard of Diehard Game Fan gave it a score of 5.5 saying that Pokemon Puzzle Challenge is better and cheaper.

Her husband was Emperor Ming of Han.  Family background and marriage to Crown Prince Zhuang  In 40, the eventual Empress Ma was born to Emperor Guangwu's General Ma Yuan, known for his expeditions against Vietnamese rebellions and his exhortations on personal living, and his wife Lady Lin (Ëó∫Â§´‰∫∫). Ma was a marquess, and Lady Ma was therefore born into comfort and wealth, as a member of a noble family. In 49, however, things would change. Ma, while on expedition against the Wulin tribes (in modern eastern Guizhou and northwestern Hunan), died during the campaign from a plague, which also killed a large number of his soldiers. After his death, Ma's deputy Geng Shu (ËÄøËàí), who had disagreed with Ma's strategy, and Emperor Guangwu's son-in-law Liang Song (Ê¢ÅÊùæ), who had prior grudges against Ma, falsely accused Ma of many crimes -- most of which is unknown to us. Two specific accusations that are known are that Ma, by the route he took against the Wulin tribes, was responsible for the plague, and that he had, while on campaigns, embezzled pearls and rhinoceros horns. (The later accusation was a misunderstanding in that one of Ma's favorite foods -- which he considered capable of warding off plagues -- was Job's tears (Chinese pearl barley), which was produced in southern China and northern Vietnam, which Ma had transported in large quantities back to the capital Luoyang.) Guangwu believed these false accusations and posthumously stripped Ma of his marquess title and fief, thus depriving the Ma family of its major source of income. The other noble families began to look down on the Ma family. Lady Ma had been previously engaged to marry a son of another noble family, the Dous. The Dous began to have second thoughts of the marriage, believing that Lady Ma was no longer worthy to marry their son. Ma's cousin Ma Yan (È¶¨Âö¥) and mother Lady Lin were angered by the Dous' attitude, and resolved to dissolve the engagement and offer Lady Ma to Crown Prince Liu Zhuang as a consort instead.  As consort to the crown prince  As a consort to the crown prince, Consort Ma was described to be excellent at serving her mother-in-law, Empress Yin Lihua, and she quickly became Empress Yin's favorite. She was also cordial and warm to her fellow consorts. As a result, she also became a favorite of Crown Prince Zhuang. One of her virtues was said to be her willingness, or indeed, eagerness, to find appropriate beautiful ladies in waiting for Crown Prince Zhuang to have sexual relations with, because at that point Crown Prince Zhuang had not had many sons. Consort Ma herself was childless. Her older sister's daughter, Consort Jia, was also a consort to the crown prince, and Consort Jia bore a son named Liu Da (ÂäâÁÇü). Crown Prince Zhuang instructed Consort Ma to adopt Prince Da as her son, and she did so. She raised him so carefully and lovingly that he never regarded anyone but her as his mother.  As empress  In 57, Emperor Guangwu died, and Crown Prince Zhuang ascended the throne as Emperor Ming. Consort Ma became an imperial consort. In 60, he created her empress and created Prince Da crown prince. As empress, Empress Ma was described as humble and solemn, and she loved reading. She often wore the less expensive white silk without elaborate designs. The imperial consorts and princesses were all surprised by how thrifty she was and yet impressed by her. Emperor Ming often consulted her on important matters of state when he could not make a decision quickly. She would analyze the issues carefully and come up with good suggestions. One thing she was described of having never done was to request favors for her brothers and cousins. Because of this, Emperor Ming continued to respect and love her. In 71, as mass tortures and executions were being carried out as a result of a conspiracy engaged in by Emperor Ming's brother Liu Ying, the Prince of Chu, Empress Ma interceded on the accused people's behalf, and as a result, Emperor Ming tapered off on his efforts to eliminate anyone who might be even remotely connected with the conspiracy. In 72, when Emperor Ming created his sons princes, he gave them relatively small principalities. Empress Ma objected -- she did not understand why these principalities were only half as large as the ones for Emperor Guangwu's sons. Emperor Ming responded that of course his sons could not be compared with his father's sons -- a response that she would remember and agree with. In 75, Emperor Ming died, and Crown Prince Da ascended the throne as Emperor Zhang. Empress Ma became empress dowager.  As empress dowager  Empress Dowager Ma continued to be known for her humility and good judgment as empress dowager. Emperor Zhang, who was close to his uncles ‚Äì Empress Dowager Ma's brothers Ma Liao (È¶¨Âªñ), Ma Fang (È¶¨Èò≤), and Ma Guang (È¶¨ÂÖâ) ‚Äì wanted to promote them quickly, but Empress Dowager Ma did not urge it. They did all become important court officials, however. In 77, when Emperor Zhang wanted to further create his uncles marquesses, Empress Ma refused, and issued an edict stating that ‚Äì just as how Emperor Ming had told her that his sons could not be compared with his father's sons ‚Äì the Mas could not be compared with the Yins and the Guos (the family of Emperor Guangwu's first empress Guo Shengtong). She further ordered the local governments not to accept improper requests from the Ma family. If there were members of Ma or other closely related families who live exuberantly, Empress Dowager Ma would remove their names from the rolls of the nobles and exile them. Empress Dowager Ma also established a textile factory and a mulberry garden for silkworms, which became a fairly productive industry for the imperial household. In her spare time, she often discussed important matters of state with Emperor Zhang and taught his sons the Confucian classics ‚Äì particularly the Analects of Confucius. In 79, over Empress Dowager Ma's objection, Emperor Zhang created his uncles marquesses. However, under pressure from the empress dowager, the new marquesses, after their requests to decline the fiefs were denied by Emperor Zhang, resigned their government posts. Later that year, Empress Dowager Ma died at the age of 39. She was buried with her husband.  References  * Book of Later Han, vols. 10, Part 1, 24. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 44, 45, 46.

Meaning of nicknames Moll, apart from being a nickname for Mary, was a common name in the 16th through 17th centuries for a young woman, usually of disreputable character.https://www.definition-of.com/MOLL The term \\"Cutpurse\\" refers to her reputation as a thief who would cut purses to steal the contents. The other name by which she was known, \\"The Roaring Girl\\" is derived from the early modern London trend of \\"roaring boys,\\" or aggressive young men of lower social stations who defied codes of civility and aped the belligerent and courtly styles of the upper class . An eccentric life The facts of her life are extremely confusing, with many exaggerations and myths attached to her name. The Life of Mrs Mary Frith, a sensationalised biography written in 1662, three years after her death, helped to perpetuate many of these myths. Mary Frith was born in the mid-1580s to a shoemaker and a housewife. Mary‚Äôs uncle, who was a minister and her father‚Äôs brother, once attempted to reform her at a young age by sending her to New England. However, she jumped overboard before the ship set sail, and refused to go near her uncle again.Mary Frith-17th- century highwaywoman Mary presented herself in public in a doublet and baggy breeches, smoking a pipe and swearing if she wished. She was recorded as having been burned on her hand four times, a common punishment for thieves. She was at one time sentenced to do penance standing in a white sheet at St. Paul‚Äôs Cross during the Sunday morning sermon. It had little effect, since she still wore men‚Äôs clothing, and she set mirrors up all around her house to stroke her vanity. Her house was surprisingly rather feminine, due to the efforts of her three full-time maids. She kept parrots and bred mastiffs. Her dogs were particularly special to her: each had its own bed with sheets and blankets. She prepared their food herself. It is believed that she first came to prominence in 1600 when she was indicted in Middlesex for stealing 2s 11d on 26 August of that year. It is at that point she began to gain notoriety. In the following years, two plays were written about her. First the 1610 drama The Madde Pranckes of Mery Mall of the Bankside by John Day, the text of which is now lost. Another play (that has survived) came a year later by Thomas Middleton and Thomas Dekker, The Roaring Girl. Both works dwelt on her scandalous behaviour, especially that of dressing in men's attire, and did not show her in an especially favourable light, though the surviving play is fairly complimentary of her by contemporary standards. The Roaring Girl, while highlighting her qualities that were deemed improper, also depicted her as possessing virtue, such as when she attacks a male character for assuming all women to be prostitutes, and when she exhibits chastity by refusing to ever marry. However, Mary seems to have been given a fair amount of freedom in a society that so frowned upon women who acted unconventionally. In 1611 Frith even performed (in men's clothing, as always) at the Fortune Theatre. On stage she bantered with the audience and sang songs while playing the lute. It can be assumed that the banter and song were somewhat obscene, but by merely performing in public at all she was defying convention. Once a showman named William Banks bet Mary 20 pounds that she wouldn‚Äôt ride from Charing Cross to Shoreditch dressed as a man. Not only did she win the bet, she rode flaunting a banner and blowing a trumpet as well. She also rode Marocco, a famous performing horse. Such public actions led to some reprisal. Frith was arrested for being dressed indecently on 25 December 1611 and accused of being involved in prostitution. On 9 February 1612 Mary was required to do a penance for her \\"evil living\\" at St. Paul's Cross. She put on a performance then, according to a letter by John Chamberland to Dudley Carlton. In his letter, Chamberland observes, \\"She wept bitterly and seemed very penitent, but it is since doubted she was maudlin drunk, being discovered to have tippled of three-quarters of sack\\". She married Lewknor Markham (possibly the son of playwright Gervase Markham) on 23 March 1614. It has been alleged that the marriage was little more than a clever charade. Evidence shows that the whole thing was contracted to give Frith a counter when suits against her referred to her as a \\"spinster\\". It turned out that society had some reason for its disapproval; by the 1620s she was, according to her own account, working as a fence and a pimp. She not only procured young women for men, but also respectable male lovers for middle-class wives. In one case where a wife confessed on her deathbed infidelity with lovers that Mary provided, Mary supposedly convinced the woman's lovers to send money for the maintenance of the children that were probably theirs. It is important to note that, at the time, women who dressed in men's attire on a regular basis were generally considered to be \\"sexually riotous and uncontrolled\\", but Mary herself claimed to be uninterested in sex. She is recorded as being released on 21 June 1644 from Bethlem Hospital after being cured of insanity,Bridewell Court Books, vol. 9/129, quoted in Mary Frith Alias Moll Cutpurse, in Life and Literature by Gustav Ungerer, Shakespeare Studies, vol. XXVIII. which may or not be related to the (possibly apocryphal) story that she robbed General Fairfax and shot him in the arm during the Civil War. It was said that to escape the gallows and Newgate Prison she paid a ¬£2,000 bribe.Leslie Stephen, ed. Dictionary of National Biography Vol. 20 (New York: MacMillan & Co, 1889): 281. She died of dropsy on 26 July 1659 on Fleet Street in London.  Image and gender  The manner in which Frith dressed and spoke challenged the moral codes of her day. She has been regarded as the \\"first female smoker of England\\" and most images of her show her smoking a pipe, which was seen as something only men did during her time period. As portrayed by the theatre of that era, tobacco smoking was not enjoyable to women. Smoking and cross-dressing were crucial to her image and character. Frith enjoyed the attention she drew, as her theatrical ways were intended to cause a scene and make others uncomfortable. In one of her performances, Amends for Ladies which was featured at the Fortune Theatre in London, Frith played in stark contrast to the other female leads. While the other women discussed their roles as wives or maids, Frith appeared as a negative representation of freedom. By cross-dressing and breaking social boundaries, she was shown as having no structure, and by gaining freedom she was shown as having lost the qualities that made her a woman. Amends for Ladies was meant to show her as a different creature entirely, not possessing the standards that a woman should hold or want to hold. These behaviours, which carried into her daily life, led to her punishment in February 1611, when she was forced to perform public penance.

New Zealand is the largest supplier of farm-raised venison. , New Zealand had approximately 3,500 intensive deer farms, with an estimated stock of 1.7 million deer. Deer farming Large-scale commercial farming of deer originated in New Zealand, and that country still has the world's most advanced deer farming industry. Deer are not native to New Zealand. The first deer were brought to the country from England and Scotland for sport in the mid to late 19th century, and released mainly in the Southern Alps and surrounding foothills. The environment proved ideal, and the uncontrolled introduced populations grew to high numbers. By the middle of the 20th century, these nonnative deer were regarded as pests because of their impact on the native forests. From the 1950s, deer cullers were employed by the government to keep the numbers in check. The export of venison from wild deer started in the 1960s, turning a pest into an export earner. Industry pioneers saw an opportunity to build on this base, and in the early 1970s started capturing live deer from the wild and farming them. A new industry was born and rapidly spread throughout New Zealand, and later to America and Canada. Fears of chronic wasting disease Since chronic wasting disease (CWD), a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy similar to mad cow disease, can pass from wild populations of deer to farmed deer, there has been some fear of contamination of the food supply. Recently, as of 2014, cases of CWD have been found in both farmed and wild cervids in the US and western Canada. New Zealand is free of CWD. The New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries undertakes an extensive testing programme which would identify the disease if it occurred in the national deer herd.

It broadcasts from its original transmitter site in Meriden, and has a rare dual city of license of Hartford-Meriden. Airing a mainstream Top 40 format, the station is currently branded as KISS 95-7 with the slogan \\"All The Hits.\\" Its studios and offices are located on Columbus Boulevard in Hartford with other radio stations. Technical WKSS transmits with frequency modulation (FM) at 95.7 MHz using a directional antenna with an effective radiated power (ERP) of 16,500 watts. The signal is nulled to the southwest to protect WFOX in Norwalk, which uses the adjacent frequency 95.9 MHz. The station has a 50 kW equivalent signal at 268 meters above average terrain. The station broadcasts from the West Peak of the Hanging Hills in Meriden on a tower with former sister station WMRQ. WKSS broadcasts in the HD Radio format.HD Radio Guide for Hartford-New Britain-Middletown Coverage area At 60 dBu, the station's primary contour is contained almost entirely within the borders of Connecticut, covering nearly all of Hartford, Middlesex, and New Haven counties, as well as the adjacent portions of Fairfield, Litchfield, New London, and Tolland Counties. At 50 dBu, WKSS remains listenable in most of the rest of Connecticut, including east into Windham County and past Norwich; southeast past New London; south into the northern portion of Long Island, New York; southwest past Bridgeport; to the west past Danbury into Dutchess and Putnam County, New York; and north over nearly all of Hampden County, Massachusetts, including the city of Springfield and almost all of its suburbs. At 40 dBu, the fringe of the signal can be traced east into western Rhode Island; most of the eastern half of Long Island to the south; Greenwich, Connecticut, and Westchester County, New York, to the southwest; west to Poughkeepsie, New York; northwest to Columbia County, New York, and Pittsfield in Berkshire County, Massachusetts; north to encompass nearly all of Hampshire County, Massachusetts; and northeast into Worcester County, Massachusetts. HistoryEarly years as WMMW-FM (1945‚Äì1960)= During World War II, the Silver City Crystal Co., the first licensee of the station that would become WKSS, was one of at least 150 American enterprises that designed and manufactured quartz crystal oscillating devices that use the mechanical resonance of a vibrating crystal of piezoelectric material such as quartz to create an electrical signal with a very precise frequency, making the timing of a clock or watch as well as the tuning of broadcast transmitters and receivers consistent and reliable. Since tuned circuits, the predecessor to the oscillating crystal, would allow frequencies to drift by as much as 4 kHz, crystal devices and the broadcast equipment in which they were installed became essential components of the military build-up during the war because they could maintain constant communication and coordination in the field. The principal owner of the Silver City companies was Carl A. Schultz, a native of Oslo, Norway, and a veteran of World War I. His son Carl W. \\"Buzz\\" Schultz managed the stations. As the wartime ban on licensing new stations was lifted, the Silver City Crystal Co. applied to the Federal Communications Commission for construction permits for AM (amplitude modulation) and FM radio licenses in Meriden. The FCC authorized the station that would become WMMW (AM) on October 8, 1945. During the week of December 31, 1945 ‚Äì January 4, 1946, it authorized WMMW-FM, the station that would become WKSS 25 years later. The launch of WMMW, which is assigned to operate at 1470 kHz, was delayed by hearings before the FCC involving companies that also held licenses for nearby stations that operate on that same regional frequency: a construction permit for WLAM in Lewiston, Maine held by the Lewiston-Auburn Broadcasting Corporation and an existing station, WSAN in Allentown, Pennsylvania, owned and operated by the Lehigh Valley Broadcasting Co. Ultimately WMMW (AM) began broadcasting on June 8, 1947. It appealed immediately to advertisers, reporting that it was already operating highly profitably with its first monthly billing reaching $135,000, all from local businesses. Within a few weeks, it was busy producing a series of tributes to Connie Mack (1862-1956), the celebrated Major League Baseball manager, as he and his Philadelphia Athletics descended on Meriden to honor the 63rd anniversary of \\"The Grand Old Man of Baseball\\" stepping to home plate in his first game as a professional player there (on July 1, 1884) with a parade, banquet, and exhibition game against the Insilcos, the city's semi-pro club. As typical for the time, finalization of the FM signal lagged behind the priority of getting its AM counterpart up and running. It did not actually sign-on to broadcast until sometime in November or December. But over the years, the first broadcast date of the FM station has been conflated with the June 8, 1947 birth date of the WMMW Radio enterprise as a whole, perhaps partly because the precise late autumn date for the launch of WMMW-FM itself has apparently been lost to history. By the start of 1948, however, WMMW-FM was simulcasting the programming on WMMW (AM) with an ERP of 7,000 watts. The stations' schedule had a variety of programs. One was the daily half-hour Polka Time hosted by Jim Dunham, who insisted that the residents of \\"PT Ville\\" submit their mailed record requests in rhyming verse. (Three letters would entitle the sender to membership in the \\"Polka Club.\\") Setting the example, he would open each show with the salutation, \\"Greetings, mates! Let's congregate. It's time to polka- palpitate.\\" Another program was Swap Shop. Monroe \\"Bill\\" Benton, moderating the show as the shop's \\"proprietor,\\" would connect listeners who phoned into the program to exchange offers for trades. The show unexpectedly created a sensational story on June 2, 1948, when a woman named Nellie Wolan called to swap her $14,000 six-bedroom house at 125 Pearl Street in Middletown, Connecticut for marriage to a man who must \\"earn [at least] $5,000 a year, [be] tall, dark, and good looking, and be very affectionate 'because I like a lot of loving.'\\" Speaking from the studio on June 4, she provided more detailed expectations for her \\"dream man\\" and opened two of the letters expressing interest since she first proffered matrimony to eligible bachelors. Benton continued to share further updates with his audience over subsequent days. A United Press International (UPI) report transformed the unemployed typist into an international human interest story, inundating Wolan with over 400 letters, telegrams, and phone calls from suitors across the United States and Canada as well as from Australia, England, France, and Spain. She dated several of the men who contacted her after they passed an interview over the phone. \\"And I'm on a party line,\\" she told the UPI. \\"The neighbors all listen in. It's embarrassing.\\" Nonetheless, one New London candidate whom she quickly began to favor turned out to be already married to someone else. In fact, none of the applicants would ever receive a proposal. Immediately after her son Howard (1950-2001) was born on November 13, 1950, with cerebral palsy, she filed a paternity lawsuit against a traveling salesman from Providence, Rhode Island. By that time, she had determined that offering to swap her house for a husband had been a poor decision. \\"A girl can't find the right man that way,\\" she told the Bridgeport Sunday Herald. Her persistent lack of income was also forcing her to consider selling the house itself. In the end, she would never marry anyone. The stations also participated in the radio industry's annual campaign to drive contributions to the March of Dimes charity. During one afternoon in 1949 for example, items donated by local merchants were auctioned by telephone to the audience for a total of $1,000. They estimated they received 500 bids. Together with WMMW (AM), WMMW-FM's first main studios and offices occupied the entire fifth (top) floor of the landmark 1870 Palace Block building at 8 W. Main Street (at the intersection with Hanover Street) in Meriden, Connecticut. They also had a studio at 505 Main Street in Middletown, Connecticut. After the Palace Block burned to the ground on February 26, 1957, the stations were temporarily removed to facilities at the FM transmitter site. New studios were built in Meriden, Connecticut inside a former pump house at 122 Charles Street at a four-acre industrial site that runs along Parker Avenue. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Meriden Curtain Fixture Company Factory since 1986, the pump house and the adjoining factory buildings were built in 1892 by the Charles Parker Co. When WMMW and WMMW-FM were there, however, the complex was home to the Silver City Glass Co. and its offspring, the Silver City Crystal Co. Functional music format Over the course of 1948 the stations' engineers worked to increase the ERP of WMMW-FM to 20 kW, receiving a few construction permit extensions along the way. At the same time, many other authorized operators were returning their FM licenses to the FCC citing the poor post-war economy and the slow sales of FM receivers to consumers, due partly to the new demand for television sets among the public. But the Silver City Crystal Company was making arrangements to use WMMW-FM for a commercial purpose that would define the station throughout the 1950s. = Muzak Origins of Functional Music = As radio broadcasting got underway in the 1920s, an entrepreneur named George Owen Squier (1865 - 1934), a major general in charge of the U.S. Army Signal Corps, invented a method to deliver music over leased telephone lines on a subscription basis. Founding \\"Wired Radio, Inc.\\" in 1922 in conjunction with the North American Company, then the country's largest utility company, Squier changed the name to \\"Muzak\\" in 1934 shortly before his death. (The name was retired in 2013 when the organization was assimilated by its holding company, Mood Media.) After struggling to find a market in consumers' homes, Muzak eventually determined that its service was better suited for retail, manufacturing, and similar business environments. Muzak developed its own recording standards that they began to characterize as \\"functional music\\". Functional music was designed for environments such as assembly lines to stimulate and maximize productivity with increases in tempo as well as deliberate periods of silence that would help to keep the workers aware of the music and their rhythms when they returned. Many American factories making equipment for the war effort used the Muzak service in their facilities. Using telephone lines gave Muzak the freedom to indulge in these pauses and play music without any announcements or other interruptions. They regarded this as a key differentiator from their radio broadcasting counterparts which were obligated by FCC regulations to have licensed operators on duty during all broadcasting hours and air proper legal identification. Furthermore, since radio could not limit its service to paid subscribers, carrying advertising was essential for any station‚Äôs financial viability. Radio simply could not match the model that Muzak was able to exploit. = Storecasting Corporation of America = By 1945, an attorney and advertising executive named Stanley Joseloff had become fascinated with the retail operations of grocery stores. In fact, as the concept of the supermarket was introduced and continued to evolve, Joseloff would patent several methods for product displays and checkout processes. He also possessed a deep background in theatrical and radio entertainment, having worked as a lawyer for brothers Lee and Jacob J. Shubert, the founders of Manhattan's Broadway district, and as a producer for the popular radio shows The Life of Riley on CBS and Time to Smile starring Eddie Cantor on NBC. He was also a successful songwriter, sharing authorship with Sidney Lippman for the \\"girl back home number\\" Dear Arabella, a minor hit for The Glenn Miller Orchestra in 1941. Joseloff envisioned using Muzak to provide functional music to grocery stores. But unlike the music-only concept in which Muzak had invested itself, he believed in carrying spoken-word announcements to advertise brands and broaden product awareness during the shopping experience. He founded his own business, Storecasting Corporation of America, around this concept. In 1945, the Storecast service debuted to fifteen First National grocery stores (later renamed ‚ÄúFinast‚Äù) in greater Hartford through the local Muzak franchise. Although not without some initial technical difficulties, the service soon expanded to grocery store chains in other major American population centers. Libby's, Coca-Cola, Swift, General Foods, and reportedly sixty other national and regional accounts became satisfied Storecast advertisers. \\"Our record of advertising renewals is excellent,\\" Joseloff crowed to the FM Association convention in Chicago on September 28, 1948. \\"We have increased average sales of all of our accounts by at least 60%.\\" Nonetheless, Storecast's limitation to point-of-sale messaging could not fulfill its advertisers' needs for reach and frequency. To solve this, Storecast partnered with stations such as The Hartford Times' simulcast of WTHT (merged with WONS in 1954 to form WGTH, today WPOP) and WTHT-FM (dark since 1950) and Seaboard Radio Broadcasting's Philadelphia simulcast of WIBG (WNTP today) and WIBG-FM (later WYSP, today WIP-FM) to carry some of its advertisers' commercials. By this time, Storecast had added the American Stores Co. and the National Tea Co. to its grocery empire of wired sound, reputedly 235 stores in all. Still, Storecast was frustrated with the Muzak franchise delivery system. Leased lines were expensive, prone to disruption, and not available in all locations. Joseloff had concluded that Storecast should conclude its Muzak operation and migrate to a radio broadcasting model instead. Joseloff addressed the convention of the FM Association to announce that he had concluded an agreement with WHFC, Inc. to start broadcasting the Storecasting service over its FM station, WEHS (WCKL today). Beginning in October, approximately 100 National (Tea) Food stores around Chicago would access the service using receivers fixed to the 97.9 MHz frequency for WEHS although any listener with a standard FM receiver would, of course, be able to tune it in as well. = Storecast affiliation = Even as WTHT-AM-FM was carrying some of the Storecasting advertising schedules in Connecticut, by December 1948 Joseloff was finalizing arrangements with the Silver City Crystal Company to broadcast the Storecast service over WMMW-FM. By January 1949, Monroe Benton was promoted from news director for the WMMW Radio simulcast to be the first program director of the programmatically independent FM station, coinciding with the power increase to 20 kW on January 10. =As WBMI (1960‚Äì1971)= As part of a process of dissolving the Silver City Crystal Company which would be completed in 1961, starting in 1960 changes were made to both WMMW stations, primarily to keep the FM station within control of the Schultz family. During the week June 16‚Äì22, 1960, the FCC authorized the company's request to change the call letters from WMMW-FM to WBMI. On August 30, 1960, Silver City sold WMMW (AM) to Meriden - Wallingford Radio, Inc. And on July 27, 1961, ownership of WBMI was formally transferred to Business Music, Inc. (not to be confused with Broadcast Music, Inc., the music licensing company that commonly uses the acronym BMI), a new firm led by Buzz Schultz. On May 1, 1962, WBMI became one of the first stations to broadcast in stereo after the FCC standardized the multiplex system.http://wwuh.org/history/CTtimeline2.htm On March 21, 1963, Business Music, Inc. applied to the FCC for permission to change the city of license for WBMI from Meriden to the combination of Hartford Meriden. When the commission granted this unusual request on October 30, 1963, it also waived the requirement that the station's main studio be maintained in Meriden, Connecticut. =As a beautiful music station (1971‚Äì1984)= On May 1, 1971, Communico, Inc. acquired WBMI from Business Music, Inc. for $426,500. Moving quickly, it changed the call letters to WKSS on May 23, 1971 and during the week June 20‚Äì26, 1971 relocated the station from 122 Charles Street in Meriden, Connecticut to the 1893 Queen Anne style Borden-Munsill mansion in Hartford, Connecticut which faces the South Green Historic District from 2 Wethersfield Avenue (at the intersection with Wyllys Street). On February 17, 1977, Insilco Broadcasting purchased WKSS for $1,689,500 and in 1978 installed Tom Durney as general manager, his first such position. To oversee programming and operations, he recruited Dick Bertel, a broadcaster well known in Connecticut after having worked on-air since 1956 for the formerly combined facilities of WTIC Radio and Channel 3 (then WTIC-TV, now WFSB in Hartford, Connecticut. Augmenting the instrumental beautiful music with some light vocals, personality-driven engagement, and a news and sports department, Bertel hosted the weekday AM drive program \\"Good Morning, New England\\" and filled the schedule with other popular hosts including Jim Perry (also the chief engineer), Mike Ogden, Jon Stevens, Steve Vallensky, Greg Williams, Roxanne Dorey [Flanders], Bob Ellsworth, Jim Austin, Douglas Richards, and Scott Vowinkle (known on-air as Scott Evans), a few of whom were also veterans of WTIC. While Durney and Bertel's strategy included attracting a significant share of the station's audience from market powerhouse WTIC (AM) (which was transitioning from a Middle-of-the-Road (MOR), music and information format into pure news/talk), WKSS' chief rival then was WRCH, another FM outlet playing beautiful music in Hartford, Connecticut. On January 26, 1981, Insilco sold WKSS to Marlin Broadcasting for $2,200,000 and transferred Durney to New Orleans to be the vice president and general manager of WQUE-FM, WGSO, and the Insilco Sports Network (appointing him less than a year later to executive vice president of the company's entire FM division). In response, Marlin's president Howard \\"Woody\\" Tanger elevated Bertel to be vice president and general manager of WKSS, a position he held while continuing to host the morning drive program. Adopting the slogans \\"The Good Music Station with Personality\\" and \\"A Kiss is More Than Just a Kiss,\\" WKSS performed well in the ratings and in revenue share while owned by Insilco and Marlin, making it possible in 1982 to move from the mansion to a fourteen-story office building located in Downtown Hartford at 60 Washington Street (at the corner of Buckingham Street), occupying street-level offices and state-of-the-art studios that afforded stunning views of the state capitol building. (Built in 1966, the building was imploded by the State of Connecticut on January 28, 2001 due to an asbestos health hazard.) =As a top 40 station (1984‚Äìpresent)= In October 1984, concert promoter Don Law, Tim Montgomery, and Bob Mitchell, who would later go on to become an influential radio consultant, formed Precision Media to purchase WKSS for $3,430,000, and flipped its format to a CHR/Top 40 as \\"95.7 The New Kiss FM\\". In the Fall of 1989, \\"95.7 Kiss FM\\" became \\"Kiss 95.7\\", and began shifting toward a Dance- leaning CHR format. Programmer Larry Hryb worked at the station from 1989 through 2000. In addition to WKCI-FM \\"KC101\\" in New Haven, Connecticut J.B. Wilde programmed WKSS through March 2015 when he was promoted by iHeartMedia to assume the program director role for both KDWB-FM and KTCZ-FM \\"Cities 97.1\\" in Minneapolis/Saint Paul, Minnesota.

All selectins are single-chain transmembrane glycoproteins that share similar properties to C-type lectins due to a related amino terminus and calcium-dependent binding. Selectins bind to sugar moieties and so are considered to be a type of lectin, cell adhesion proteins that bind sugar polymers.  Structure  All three known members of the selectin family (L-, E-, and P-selectin) share a similar cassette structure: an N-terminal, calcium-dependent lectin domain, an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, a variable number of consensus repeat units (2, 6, and 9 for L-, E-, and P-selectin, respectively), a transmembrane domain (TM) and an intracellular cytoplasmic tail (cyto). The transmembrane and cytoplasmic parts are not conserved across the selectins being responsible for their targeting to different compartments. Though they share common elements, their tissue distribution and binding kinetics are quite different, reflecting their divergent roles in various pathophysiological processes. Types There are three subsets of selectins: * E-selectin (in endothelial cells) * L-selectin (in leukocytes) * P-selectin (in platelets and endothelial cells) L-selectin is the smallest of the vascular selectins, expressed on all granulocytes and monocytes and on most lymphocytes, can be found in most leukocytes. P-selectin, the largest selectin, is stored in Œ±-granules of platelets and in Weibel‚ÄìPalade bodies of endothelial cells, and is translocated to the cell surface of activated endothelial cells and platelets. E-selectin is not expressed under baseline conditions, except in skin microvessels, but is rapidly induced by inflammatory cytokines. These three types share a significant degree of sequence homology among themselves (except in the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains) and between species. Analysis of this homology has revealed that the lectin domain, which binds sugars, is most conserved, suggesting that the three selectins bind similar sugar structures. The cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains are highly conserved between species, but not conserved across the selectins. These parts of the selectin molecules are responsible for their targeting to different compartments: P-selectin to secretory granules, E-selectin to the plasma membrane, and L-selectin to the tips of microfolds on leukocytes. Etymology The name selectin comes from the words \\"selected\\" and \\"lectins,\\" which are a type of carbohydrate-recognizing protein.  Function  Selectins are involved in constitutive lymphocyte homing, and in chronic and acute inflammation processes, including post-ischemic inflammation in muscle, kidney and heart, skin inflammation, atherosclerosis, glomerulonephritis and lupus erythematosus and cancer metastasis. During an inflammatory response, P-selectin is expressed on endothelial cells first, followed by E-selectin later. Stimuli such as histamine and thrombin cause endothelial cells to mobilize immediate release of preformed P-selectin from Weible-Palade bodies inside the cell. Cytokines such as TNF-alpha stimulate transcription and translation of E-selectin and additional P-selection, which account for the delay of several hours. As the leukocyte rolls along the blood vessel wall, the distal lectin- like domain of the selectin binds to certain carbohydrate groups presented on proteins (such as PSGL-1) on the leukocyte, which slows the cell and allows it to leave the blood vessel and enter the site of infection. The low-affinity nature of selectins is what allows the characteristic \\"rolling\\" action attributed to leukocytes during the leukocyte adhesion cascade. Each selectin has a carbohydrate recognition domain that mediates binding to specific glycans on apposing cells. They have remarkably similar protein folds and carbohydrate binding residues, leading to overlap in the glycans to which they bind. Selectins bind to the sialyl Lewis X (SLex) determinant ‚ÄúNeuAcŒ±2-3GalŒ≤1-4(FucŒ±1-3)GlcNAc.‚Äù However, SLex, per se, does not constitute an effective selectin receptor. Instead, SLex and related sialylated, fucosylated glycans are components of more extensive binding determinants. The best-characterized ligand for the three selectins is P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), which is a mucin-type glycoprotein expressed on all white blood cells. Neutrophils and eosinophils bind to E-selectin. One of the reported ligands for E-selectin is the sialylated Lewis X antigen (SLex). Eosinophils, like neutrophils, use sialylated, protease-resistant structures to bind to E-selectin, although the eosinophil expresses much lower levels of these structures on its surface. Ligands for P-selectin on eosinophils and neutrophils are similar sialylated, protease-sensitive, endo-beta- galactosidase-resistant structures, clearly different than those reported for E-selectin, and suggest disparate roles for P-selectin and E-selectin during recruitment during inflammatory responses. Bonding mechanisms Selectins have hinge domains, allowing them to undergo rapid conformational changes in the nanosecond range between ‚Äòopen‚Äô and ‚Äòclosed‚Äô conformations. Shear stress on the selectin molecule causes it to favor the ‚Äòopen‚Äô conformation. In leukocyte rolling, the ‚Äòopen‚Äô conformation of the selectin allows it to bind to inward sialyl Lewis molecules farther up along the PSGL-1 chain, increasing overall binding affinity‚Äîif the selectin-sialyl Lewis bond breaks, it can slide and form new bonds with the other sialyl Lewis molecules down the chain. In the ‚Äòclosed‚Äô conformation, however, the selectin is only able to bind to one sialyl Lewis molecule, and thus has greatly reduced binding affinity. The result of such is that selectins exhibit catch and slip bond behavior‚Äîunder low shear stresses, their bonding affinities are actually increased by an increase in tensile force applied to the bond because of more selectins preferring the ‚Äòopen‚Äô conformation. At high stresses, the binding affinities are still reduced because the selectin-ligand bond is still a normal slip bond. It is thought that this shear stress threshold helps select for the right diameter of blood vessels to initiate leukocyte extravasation, and may also help prevent inappropriate leukocyte aggregation during vascular stasis. Role in cancer It is becoming evident that selectin may play a role in inflammation and progression of cancer. Tumor cells exploit the selectin- dependent mechanisms mediating cell tethering and rolling interactions through recognition of carbohydrate ligands on tumor cell to enhance distant organ metastasis, showing ‚Äòleukocyte mimicry‚Äô. A number of studies have shown increased expression of carbohydrate ligands on metastatic tumor, enhanced E-selectin expression on the surface of endothelial vessels at the site at tumor metastasis, and the capacity of metastatic tumor cells to roll and adhere to endothelial cells, indicating the role of selectins in metastasis. In addition to E-selectin, the role of P-selectin (expressed on platelets) and L-selectin (on leukocytes) in cancer dissemination has been suggested in the way that they interact with circulating cancer cells at an early stage of metastasis. =Organ selectivity= The selectins and selectin ligands determine the organ selectivity of metastasis. Several factors may explain the seed and soil theory or homing of metastasis. In particular, genetic regulation and activation of specific chemokines, cytokines and proteases may direct metastasis to a preferred organ. In fact, the extravasation of circulating tumor cells in the host organ requires successive adhesive interactions between endothelial cells and their ligands or counter-receptors present on the cancer cells. Metastatic cells that show a high propensity to metastasize to certain organs adhere at higher rates to venular endothelial cells isolated from these target sites. Moreover, they invade the target tissue at higher rates and respond better to paracrine growth factors released from the target site. Typically, the cancer cell/endothelial cell interactions imply first a selectin-mediated initial attachment and rolling of the circulating cancer cells on the endothelium. The rolling cancer cells then become activated by locally released chemokines present at the surface of endothelial cells. This triggers the activation of integrins from the cancer cells allowing their firmer adhesion to members of the Ig-CAM family such as ICAM, initiating the transendothelial migration and extravasation processes.[72] The appropriate set of endothelial receptors is sometimes not expressed constitutively and the cancer cells have to trigger their expression. In this context, the culture supernatants of cancer cells can trigger the expression of E- selectin by endothelial cells suggesting that cancer cells may release by themselves cytokines such as TNF-Œ±, IL-1Œ≤ or INF-Œ≥ that will directly activate endothelial cells to express E-selectin, P-selectin, ICAM-2 or VCAM. On the other hand, several studies further show that cancer cells may initiate the expression of endothelial adhesion molecules in a more indirect ways. Since the adhesion of several cancer cells to endothelium requires the presence of endothelial selectins as well as sialyl Lewis carbohydrates on cancer cells, the degree of expression of selectins on the vascular wall and the presence of the appropriate ligand on cancer cells are determinant for their adhesion and extravasation into a specific organ. The differential selectin expression profile on endothelium and the specific interactions of selectins expressed by endothelial cells of potential target organs and their ligands expressed on cancer cells are major determinants that underlie the organ-specific distribution of metastases. Research Selectins are involved in projects to treat osteoporosis, a disease that occurs when bone-creating cells called osteoblasts become too scarce. Osteoblasts develop from stem cells, and scientists hope to eventually be able to treat osteoporosis by adding stem cells to a patient‚Äôs bone marrow. Researchers have developed a way to use selectins to direct stem cells introduced into the vascular system to the bone marrow.In the lab of Robert Sackstein Harvard University E-selectins are constitutively expressed in the bone marrow, and researchers have shown that tagging stem cells with a certain glycoprotein causes these cells to migrate to the bone marrow. Thus, selectins may someday be essential to a regenerative therapy for osteoporosis.Sackstein Lab  See also  * Sushi domain  References  External links  * Sackstein Lab of Research * Computer-generated movie of the mobilization of P-selectin inside a leukocyte at mcb.harvard.edu Category:Cell adhesion proteins Category:Lectins Category:Selectins Category:Protein domains Category:Single-pass transmembrane proteins ","title":"Selectin"},{"id":"2750193","text":"Ivan Pavlovich Malakhov (born June 29, 1953 in Pologoye Zaimische, Astrakhan Oblast, Russian SFSR) is former governor of Sakhalin Oblast.

Scientists from Porton Down and the Royal Navy were involved in releasing biological agents, including pneumonic and bubonic plague, brucellosis and tularaemia and testing the effects of the agents on caged monkeys and guinea pigs. While the tests were carried out by Britain, the tests were a joint Anglo-US-Canadian operation, with a US Navy Lieutenant Commander taking part. US documents showed that the operation was not purely defensive, as later claimed; at a joint 1958 conference in Canada the US chemical corps minuted \\"it was agreed ... studies should be continued on aerosols ... all three countries should concentrate on the search for incapacitating and new-type lethal agents\\". The tests The experiments were carried out at sea, off the coast of the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, aboard a floating pontoon, supported by the ship Ben Lomond. The test animals were placed in cages on the deck of the pontoon and biological agents dispersed either from a bomb suspended from a boom or by being sprayed. After being exposed, the animals were taken aboard the Ben Lomond and those that died were dissected to determine the cause of death. 3,492 guinea pigs and 83 monkeys were used in the tests. The tests were initially judged to be a success, both in terms of the effectiveness of the biological agents and the test platform. However, a year later, this decision was reversed, with the tests on plague bacteria being described as a \\"failure\\" and the statement that \\"brucellosis has not increased its reputation as a dangerous agent.\\" Carella incident In the final test of the series, the Fleetwood-based trawler Carella, with a crew of eighteen, ignored warnings to steer clear and unwittingly sailed through a cloud of plague bacteria (Yersinia pestis) on its return from a fishing trip to the waters around Iceland, causing concern about a possible plague outbreak around its home port in north-west England. The Carella was not stopped for disinfection or medical examination but was kept under covert observation by a destroyer and a fisheries vessel for twenty-one days, and the ship's radio communications were monitored for any kind of medical distress call. The surveillance period included a period of shore- leave at Blackpool, during which the crew mixed with the people of the town as usual. None of the crew became ill. The incident was dealt with at the highest levels of government, going through the First Sea Lord to the Chancellor of the Exchequer Rab Butler, who was deputising for the absent Winston Churchill. The event was successfully covered up at the time and, after the danger had passed, most of the documents relevant to the case were ordered to be burnt. Even the crew of the Carella were unaware of the incident until approached by a BBC documentary crew more than fifty years later. Civil servant Clive Ponting, who had been acquitted by a jury in a \\"perverse verdict\\" after leaking secret documents about the sinking of the ARA General Belgrano in the Falklands War, in 1985 came across the one file that had not been destroyed, and confidentially told The Observer newspaper about it, leading to a story that July headlined British germ bomb sprayed trawler. Ministerial intervention In 1979 Western Isles MP Donald Stewart, aware of rumours about the trial, questioned Defence Secretary Francis Pym about them in Parliament. Pym gave reassurances that \\"they did not impinge in any way on the general public\\". The Observer's report about this incorrect statement commented that there was no reason to think that he had any idea of the truth. In 1994, the local Member of Parliament, Calum Macdonald called uponHansard, House of Commons, 9 February 1994.Hansard, House of Commons, 4 March 1994.on Defence Secretary Hansard, House of Commons, 4 March 1994. the then-Secretary of State for Defence, Malcolm Rifkind, to commission an independent report on Operations Cauldron and Hesperus in 1952 and 1953, and all similar chemical weapons tests about which the public reasonably seek reassurance. An initial Commons question by him to the Ministry Of Defence was referred to the director-general of the Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment at Porton Down, Wiltshire. In his letter, Dr Pearson said: The papers on Operations Cauldron and Hesperus are classified, and it would not be in the national interest to make these available as the information therein could be misused by states seeking to acquire a biological weapons capability. The pathogens used were as follows: (a) Operation Cauldron: the pathogens that cause brucellosis and plague. (b) Operation Hesperus: the pathogens that cause brucellosis and tularaemia. Dr Pearson added: The safety aspects of handling, transport and packaging were all carefully addressed to ensure there was no danger to any of those engaged in the trial. There is no cause to believe that there was any hazard to the public or the environment and there is no evidence to the contrary. Mr MacDonald responded at the time saying: This reply is deeply unsatisfactory and does not provide any of the reassurances which I and my constituents seek about the tests. He continued to outline his belief that it was not satisfactory that the same Government organisation which carried out potentially highly dangerous experiments should be allowed to pass the final judgment on itself regarding the health implications both then and subsequently.http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/plague-virus- inquiry-urged-over-minch-tests-1.718369 Ruling against the MOD On the 21st of January 2008 the Information Commissioner's Office ruled against the MOD to release a video they made on Operation Cauldron. The video contains images of identifiable individuals, and the MOD argued that it would need to obscure or mask the faces of the individuals, as this information would be exempt under sections 38, 40(2) and 44 of the Act. The MOD estimated that the process of masking would exceed the cost limit as set out in section 12 of the Act, and therefore refused the complainant's request. The Commissioner found that the footage did contain images of identifiable individuals, some of whom may still be alive, but that disclosure of the footage would not breach any of the data protection principles. For this reason the Commissioner found that the MOD wrongly applied the exemption under sections 38, 40(2) and 44, and the cost limit under section 12. The Commissioner therefore directed the MOD to disclose the footage in full. The video released was about 47 minutes long and showed the pontoon which was situated off the coast of the Tolsta District on the North East of the Isle of Lewis. The exact location was between Cellar head and Tolsta head. Many of the Tolsta villagers can remember the ship and seeing white gas clouds in the testing. The video shows a flight coming in and describes the arrival of the biological agents from the Microbiological Research Department (MRD) at Porton Down. On the pontoon they placed the animals in small boxes and released the agents, before returning after to check the results and burning the dead animals.Operation CAULDRON 1952 (video) References Cauldron Cauldron Category:Animal testing in the United Kingdom Category:1952 in the United Kingdom ","title":"Operation Cauldron"},{"id":"2750273","text":"Sigmund Groven (born 16 March 1946 in Heddal, Telemark) is a Norwegian classical harmonica player, today considered one of the world's leading classical harmonica players. He plays with a large number of the world's leading musicians and orchestras, and he has made 23 recordings yet in his own name (compilations not counted). His repertoire ranges from popular and folk music to his own compositions, from Bach to contemporary music. Influences and early career Groven grew up in a family with rich music and cultural traditions. His uncle was the folk musician and composer, Eivind Groven (1901‚Äì77). As a child, he heard Tommy Reilly playing harmonica on radio, and was fascinated by what he heard. From 1960, Groven studied with Reilly in London, in 1965 he performed as a solo artist for the first time, and has since often been seen and heard on TV and radio. Groven has worked as a music producer, radio presenter, programme producer for radio and as a music teacher, at Norwegian universities and at master-classes around the world. In 1971 Groven presented his first original composition; the music to Erik Bye's poem, \\"S√• spiller vi harmonica\\", and he continued to work with Erik Bye on a number of songs and projects. Collaborations, soundtracks, main works Groven has contributed to over 250 recordings, and has written more than 350 original compositions, from children's songs and instrumental ballads to movie and TV soundtracks, and works on a larger scale. He has written music to lyrics and poems by Ove R√∏sbak, Halvor J. Sandsdalen, Tarjei Vesaas, Olav Kaste, Hans B√∏rli, Josef G.Larssen and Erik Bye. Composers who have written music especially for Groven include Hui Cheung Wai, √òistein Sommerfeldt, Terje Rypdal, James Moody, Johan Kvandal, Oddvar S. Kvam, Ketil Bj√∏rnstad, Kristian Lindeman, Henning Sommerro, Iver Kleive, Egil Kapstad, Kenneth Sivertsen, Johan √òian, John Surman, Siegfried Steinkogler, Lars Tilling, and Fried Walter. Soundtracks include the films \\"For Tors skyld\\" and \\"Fuglekongen\\", and the TV documentary series \\"Vi p√• Langedrag\\". Many of Groven's recordings have become part of the Norwegian cultural heritage. Reodors ballade (by Bent Fabricius-Bjerre) from the movie \\"Fl√•klypa Grand Prix\\", \\"Svalbard theme\\" by B√∏hren & √Öserud, and a version of Henning Sommero's \\"V√•rs√∏g\\" are among the instrumental classics of Norwegian music, loved by several generations. Groven has recorded 23 albums ranging from original music via Beatles hits to classical works. His albums are sold worldwide and he enjoys great popularity in Asia. Groven has toured all over the world with solo recitals from New York (Carnegie Hall) to Tokyo (Casals Hall). In 2002 he became the first harmonica- player to appear as soloist with the Mozarteum Orchestra in Salzburg giving the world premiere of Siegfried Steinkogler‚Äôs Harmonica Concerto, and has performed with symphony and chamber orchestras in the US, Canada, Europe and Asia, including Academy of St. Martin in the Fields, the radio orchestras of Berlin, Munich, Brussels, Stockholm and London, the Hong Kong City Chamber Orchestra and orchestras in Quebec, Dallas, Minneapolis and Anchorage. He has been featured at festivals and major events in Washington (Smithsonian Institution), Los Angeles, San Francisco, Minneapolis, Dallas, Houston, New Orleans, Toronto, most major cities in western Europe as well as Budapest, Belgrade, Athens, also Riydah, Jeddah, Hong Kong, Taipei, Seoul, Kyoto and Yokohama.  Teaching  For more than 30 years Groven has been teaching at the annual summer courses organized by the Norwegian Harmonica Association. He has also been teaching at the Trondheim Conservatory of Music and has given master-classes both in Europe, North America, and several Asian countries. Since August 2018, Sigmund Groven is harmonica teacher at the Norwegian Academy of Music in Oslo.

She is the author of five poems which focused on Christian themes of salvation and the second coming of Christ. Her work on the lives of John the Baptist and Jesus, according to Sarah Westphal-Wihl, \\"has been praised as the first German epic\\". She is known for her simple rhyming couplets written in the vernacular, making complex biblical teachings accessible to the people of her time. Life Little is known about the life of Ava beyond her work and some inferences into her identity as an anchorite (anchoress). It is known that she was married and bore two sons who are mentioned in the afterword of her poem posthumously named Das J√ºngste Gericht (The Last Judgement). Through this afterward we also learn that one of Ava's sons died within her lifetime, though the age at which he died and the cause of death are not stated. Due to her vast knowledge of scripture, most scholars identify Ava the poet with a certain Ava whose death is recorded in a number of monasteries in present day Austria. It is likely that after the death of her husband, Ava lived as an enclosed woman on the estate of G√∂ttweig Abbey in Lower Austria, near Krems, or perhaps in Melk Abbey. In Klein-Wien near G√∂ttweig there remains still today a tower called \\"Ava's Tower\\" (Avaturm), possibly the remains of the earlier nunnery. It seems fairly certain that the church of Saint Blaise in Klein-Wien stands on the site of the little chapel that was there at the time of Ava. Until recently, Ava was usually referred to as \\"Frau Ava\\". The convention at least in English-speaking scholarship has changed since the appearance of the Rushing edition, which pointed out that the title \\"Frau\\" sounds patronising when male poets of the period are not called \\"Herr Wolfram\\" etc. Works Four untitled poems attributed to Ava are found in the Vorauer Manuscript dated 1150. These four poems are seen again, with the addition of a fifth detailing the life of John the Baptist, in a fourteenth century manuscript found in the town of Gorlitz. Ava is credited with these five poems due to their appearance together in these early manuscripts along with the poem, later titled Das J√ºngste Gericht (The Last Judgement), in whose afterward Ava is named as Author. All five poems resemble one another in style, grammar, and theme, leading scholars to believe that they were indeed penned by the same hand. Though writing in the vernacular, Ava displays an apt ability to convey great meaning in simple measure. The wide array of images that appear in her poetry point to a deep understanding of Christian theology as well as a vast pool of sources from which she found inspiration. She is able to weave together various narratives found in the Gospel‚Äôs in a way that displays her mastery of the material while creating a distinct voice for herself. In her poetry Ava uses the Commentaries of Bede, Rabanus Maurus and Alcuin, Adso's Libellus de Antichristo (or his Latin source) and other works. The poems all centre on themes of salvation and the end of the Catholic Church as detailed in Revelations. Like most composers of medieval biblical epics, she incorporates many ideas and motifs belonging to the so-called Medieval popular Bible, motifs which were popular in her time, and remain popular into ours - such as the ox and the ass at the crib - which are in fact not to be found in the Bible itself. She also adds content from the Apocrypha. *\\"Johannes\\" (\\"John the Baptist\\") *\\"Leben Jesu\\" (\\"Jesus, The Son of God\\") with a final section on \\"Die 7 Gaben des Heiligen Geistes\\" (\\"The Seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit\\") (Vorau Manuscript) *\\"Antichrist\\" (Vorau Manuscript) *\\"Das J√ºngste Gericht\\" (\\"The Last Judgment\\") (Vorau Manuscript) *The Seven Gifts of The Holy Spirit Frau Ava Literature Prize A biennial literary prize known as the Frau Ava Literaturpreis was instituted by local endeavour in 2001 and first awarded in 2003, open to works by already published female writers in German on spiritual, religious or political topics aimed at, or appealing to, a youth readership.

Willis, challenged by a weight disorder as well as paranoid schizophrenia, is followed in his daily tasks, trials and tribulations in autumn 2000, showing him writing his unique yet virtually identical songs, playing a show, attending to daily chores, and working on his ink paintings at Genesis.  Plot  Shot in and around Willis' native Chicago area, the documentary simply shows footage of Willis' daily life with his songs serving as the soundtrack. Willis appears unkempt, obese and mentally unstable. His songwriting technique is shown as he visits a local Kinko's dressed sloppily and barefoot, and types expletives and repetitive bestiality references on a computer as lyrics and prints the document. His songs deal with subjects such as praise for celebrities that he had met or admired, reports on bands that he had seen, stories about violent confrontations with superheroes, and expletive-packed rants at his mental demons. Willis says music helps him silence the discouraging mental voices, but his fan following comes from people who find his songs humorous. Many of his compositions are very similar, a fact that is highlighted by scenes of him recording songs such as \\"I Whipped Superman's Ass\\", \\"I Whipped Spider-Man's Ass\\" and \\"I Whupped Batman's Ass\\", which are overlaid to highlight their similarities. Willis also visits a zoo, overdubbed with one of his many songs about bestiality. Towards the end Willis is shown playing with his band, the Wesley Willis Fiasco. Several of Willis' friends are interviewed, among them recording engineer Steve Albini. They reminisce over how they met Willis and how they feel about him. Generally they are all sympathetic about his plight and it is stated he would likely be dead if he had not cultivated such a network. One friend describes Willis' poor upbringing (involving forced viewing of his mother having sex in exchange for drugs), and Willis' own despair at his condition: \\"I'm already doomed.

In 1980, he graduated from Fairmont High School in Kettering, Ohio, and moved to Hollywood to attend Musicians Institute/GIT in 1984. He graduated from the Institute in 1985 and began his career as a guitar teacher. Megadeth Newly hired Megadeth's guitarist Jay Reynolds (of Malice) had commissioned guitar teacher Young to play all of his solos on the new album, transcribe the previous Megadeth releases, and teach him everything in time for the pending tours. Reynolds was one of Youngs guitar students. However, after witnessing Young decipher previous guitarist Chris Poland's solos from Peace Sells... but Who's Buying? note-for-note in less than 30 minutes, frontman Dave Mustaine decided instead to hire Young. Young joined the band with only two weeks left in the recording schedule and contributed half of the guitar solos and multiple electric and acoustic rhythm parts to the album. Jeff's career with Megadeth was spent recording and touring in support of their 1988 platinum selling album, So Far, So Good... So What! His first performance with the band appeared in The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years as a member of Megadeth. Author and jazz & world fusion excursions Following his time in Megadeth, Jeff wrote the cult-classic Fingerprints column in Guitar for the Practicing Musician magazine. He also began intensive study of the blues with legendary guitarist, Steve Hunter (Peter Gabriel, Lou Reed, Alice Cooper, Jason Becker). For a portion of the 1990s, Jeff stepped away from his career to deal with the untimely deaths of first his father and later his mother while immersing himself in the further study of classical, flamenco, gypsy jazz and other world music varieties In 1998, he resurfaced with new Brazilian musical partner, Badi Assad. Together, the duo crafted exotic soundscapes for Verve/PolyGram records collaboration entitled, Badi Assad's Chameleon. The album (co-written, arranged, and produced by Jeff), climbed to the top of the world music charts in Germany & Holland also topping JAZZIZ magazine's Readers Poll: \\"Best Brazilian Albums of the Year.\\" Opening concerts for renowned artists including Joe Cocker and Cassandra Wilson, as well as performances on 1999's Lilith Fair and Farm Aid 2000, Jeff's association with the Assad family also spawned songwriting collaborations with guitar luminary Sergio Assad and two pieces on Badi's Verde album. In 2003, the track \\"Waves\\" from Chameleon was featured in the Michael and Kirk Douglas film It Runs in the Family, as well as on the movie's soundtrack. Equilibrium In late-October 2009, his debut solo album, Equilibrium, was released on CD worldwide, as well as cdbaby. Young began working on the album in 2000. Stylistically, the album features flamenco, classic, 6 & 12 steel-string guitar styles as well as the electric guitar. Equilibrium features guest performances by Debby Holiday, Twinkle, Gilli Moon, Lenine, Matt Chamberlain, Hilary Jones, Tony Franklin and Viviana Guzman. Personal life Young overcame testicular cancer in 2006 - he was treated by Dr. Lawence Einhorn (the same doctor who treated Lance Armstrong). Current projects Young is the host of the Internet radio show Music Without Boundaries on the Spreaker broadcast network. Jeff is currently writing, producing & releasing solo, instrumental music on the High-Tone Eleven Records label. His first, all instrumental album entitled, Revolutions is being released track by track with the singles, \\"Monsoon\\" - \\"In The Flesh\\" & \\"Slow Burn\\" available now via his official web site & most digital distribution sources. Revolutions features performances from some of the world's top players: Tina Guo, Ric Fierrabracci, James LoMenzo, Brian Tichy, Jeff Bowders & Shane Gaalaas.

Source code leaks  Source code leaks are usually caused by misconfiguration of software like CVS or FTP which allow people to get source files through exploits, software bugs, or employees that have access to the sources or part of them revealing the code in order to harm the company. There were many cases of source code leaks in the history of software development. *As Fraunhofer IIS released in 1994 only a low quality version of their MP3 encoding software (l3enc), a hacker named SoloH gathered the source code from the unprotected servers of the University of Erlangen and developed a higher quality version, which started the MP3 revolution on the internet.The heavenly jukebox on The Atlantic \\"To show industries how to use the codec, MPEG cobbled together a free sample program that converted music into MP3 files. The demonstration software created poor-quality sound, and Fraunhofer did not intend that it be used. The software's \\"source code\\"‚Äîits underlying instructions‚Äîwas stored on an easily accessible computer at the University of Erlangen, from which it was downloaded by one SoloH, a hacker in the Netherlands (and, one assumes, a Star Wars fan). SoloH revamped the source code to produce software that converted compact-disc tracks into music files of acceptable quality.\\" (2000)Technologies of Piracy? - Exploring the Interplay Between Commercialism and Idealism in the Development of MP3 and DivX by HENDRIK STORSTEIN SPILKER, SVEIN H√ñIER, page 2072, International Journal of Communication 7 (2013)euronet.nl/~soloh/mpegEnc *Around 1996 Electronic Arts accidentally put the source code of the video game FIFA 97 on a demo disc.When EA Sports Accidentally Put a Game's Source Code on a Demo Disc by Luke Plunkett on kotaku.com (May 2, 2012) *In 2003 a hacker exploited a security hole in Microsoft's Outlook to get the complete source of the video game Half-Life 2, which was under development at the time. The complete source was soon available in various file sharing networks.

Researchers at Johns Hopkins University and Rice University published a critique of Diebold's products, based on an analysis of the software. They found, for example, that it would be easy to program a counterfeit voting card to work with the machines and then use it to cast multiple votes inside the voting booth. *In 2003 a Chinese hacker acquired the source code for Lineage II and sold it to someone in California who then used it to create a bootleg version of the game, powered by his own servers. Despite warnings from NCSoft that pirating an online game was considered illegal, he continued doing so for a few years, until the Federal Bureau of Investigation finally raided his home in 2007, seized the servers and permanently disabled the website that fronted his bootleg version of Lineage II.fbi-shuts-down-lineage-ii-private-server on mmorpg.com (2007)CRACKING THE CODE Online IP Theft Is Not a Game on FBI.gov (02/01/2007) *In 2003, one year after 3dfx was bought by Nvidia and support ended, the source code for their drivers leaked,Treiber-Quellcode von 3dfx im Netz aufgetaucht - Von Nvidia offenbar geduldet by Christian Kla√ü on Golem.de (May 7, 2003, in German) resulting in fan-made, updated drivers.NuAngel.net Drivers on nuangel.net *In 2004, a large portion of Windows NT 4.0's source code and a small percentage (reportedly about 15%) of Windows 2000's were leaked online.Windows Code May Be Stolen on PC World by Joris Evers (February 2004) The Windows 2000 source code leak was analysed by a writer for (now defunct) website Kuro5hin who noted that while the code was generally well written, it allegedly contained about \\"a dozen\\" instances of profanity and the milder euphemism \\"crap\\". The writer also noted that there were a lot of code hacks, with the \\"uglier\\" ones mostly being for compatibility with older programs and some hardware. It was feared that because of the leak, the number of security exploits would increase due to wider scrutiny of the source code. It was later discovered that the source of the leak originated from Mainsoft. *Also in 2004, partial (800 MB) proprietary source code that drives Cisco Systems' networking hardware was made available in the internet. The site posted two files of source code written in the C programming language, which apparently enables some next-generation IPv6 functionality. News of the latest source code leak appeared on a Russian security site. *In 2006, Anonymous hackers stole source code (about 1 GiB) for Symantec's pcAnywhere from the company's network. While confirmed in January 2012, it is still unclear how the hackers accessed the network. *In late 2007, the source code of Norton Ghost 12 and a Norton Anti-Spyware version were available via BitTorrent. *In December 2007 and January 8, a Pirate Bay user published the sources of five Idera SQL products via BitTorrent. *In January 2011 the \\"stolen source code\\" of Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2008 was published on the Pirate Bay. *On May 20, 2011, EVE Online's source code was published by someone on a GitHub repository.

That included Intel ME, Intel Microcode and software simulators of their hardware. Their various BIOS source code was also leaked. The SpaceX cameras firmware that Intel worked on also leaked. The data is being distributing through a torrent. * On September 23, 2020, Windows XP SP1 and Windows Server 2003 source code leaked including Microsoft Paint and DirectX 8 and a library to sign and verify signature on font files. = End- of-life leaks by developers = Sometimes software developers themselves will intentionally leak their source code in an effort to prevent a software product from becoming abandonware after it has reached its end-of-life, allowing the community to continue development and support. Reasons for leaking instead of a proper release to public domain or as open-source can include scattered or lost intellectual property rights. An example is the video game Falcon 4.0 which became available in 2000; another one is Dark Reign 2, which was released by an anonymous former Pandemic Studios developer in 2011. Another notable example is an archive of Infocom's video games source code which appeared from an anonymous Infocom source and was archived by the Internet Archive in 2008. Other leaks * In late 1998, a number of confidential Microsoft documents later dubbed the Halloween documents were leaked to Eric S. Raymond, an activist in the open-source software movement, who published and commented on them online. The documents revealed that internally Microsoft viewed free and open-source software such as Linux as technologically competitive and a major threat for Microsoft's dominance in the market, and they discussed strategies to combat them. The discovery caused a public controversy. The documents were also used as evidence in several court cases. * Nintendo's crossover fighting video game series Super Smash Bros. has a history of having unconfirmed content leaked. Every game since (and including) 2008's Super Smash Bros. Brawl has been affected by leaks in some form: **Super Smash Bros. Brawl for the Wii was leaked by a video on the Japanese language wii.com website, revealing unconfirmed playable characters on January 28, 2008 (three days before the game's Japanese release). **Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U was afflicted in August 2014 by the \\"ESRB leak\\", where many screenshots and limited video footage of the 3DS version were leaked by a supposed member of the ESRB. The leak gained traction very quickly due to the screenshots mostly containing elements that the game ratings board would be interested in, such as trophies of suggestively-dressed female characters (some of which were later found to be edited or cut altogether in the final game). **Super Smash Bros. Ultimate was leaked in its entirety two weeks before its release, allowing many to play and datamine in advance. While the entire roster of characters and stages had already been officially revealed, many unrevealed collectibles, music tracks, and story elements were discovered and distributed. This prompted Nintendo to issue copyright strikes to many YouTube and Twitch channels. * Several high-profile books have been leaked on the Internet before their official release date, including If I Did It, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, and an early draft of the first twelve chapters of Midnight Sun. The leak of the latter prompted the author Stephenie Meyer to suspend work on the novel. * On January 31, 2014 the original uncensored version of the South Park episode \\"201\\" was leaked, when it was illegally pulled from the South Park Studios servers and was posted online in its entirety without any approval by Comedy Central. The episode was heavily censored by the network when it aired in 2010 against the will of series creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, and was never formally released uncensored to the public. The episode was the second in a two parter and was censored after the airing of the first part as a result of death threats from Islamic extremists who were angry of the episode's storyline satirizing censorship of depictions of Muhammad. * In 2015 the unaired Aqua Teen Hunger Force episode \\"Boston\\" was leaked online. The episode was set to air during the fifth season as a response to a controversial publicity stunt for Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters that occurred in the titular city, but Adult Swim was forced to pull it to avoid further controversy. * On March 13, 2016, the full list of qualifying teams and first round match-ups for the 2016 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament leaked on Twitter in the midst of a television special being broadcast by CBS to officially unveil them. The leak exacerbated criticism of a new, two-hour format for the selection broadcast, which was criticized for revealing the full tournament bracket at a slower pace than in previous years.

AICP certifies professionals in the United States in the field of Urban planning and assists planners in the areas of ethics, professional development, planning education, and the standards of planning practice. Members of AICP pledge to adhere to a detailed Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. Once certified, professional planners may place the designation \\"AICP\\" after their name to indicate their membership in AICP, and their mastery of the principles, skills, knowledge, and experience determined by the organization as essential for a professional planner. To become certified, a planner must have a specified combination of relevant education and professional experience, must pass an examination that tests skills and knowledge, must pay an annual fee, and must be a member of the American Planning Association in good standing. The AICP certification exam is offered twice a year for two weeks, in May and November. Beginning in 2004 the exam uses a computer-based format. To maintain membership in the AICP, a certified planner must earn a specified number of continuing education credit hours that include courses in planning law and ethics every two years. Experience Combined with education, a potential candidate for the AICP exam must have a required number of years of professional planning experience. The amount of experience depends on education. The Planning Accreditation Board awards and certifies planning programs accreditation. After graduation from an accredited master's planning program, a person has to have only two years of professional planning experience before he or she may sit for the AICP exam. Graduation from a non-accredited program with a master's degree in planning requires three years of experience. Graduating with a PAB accredited bachelor's planning degree, a person has to have three years of professional planning experience to sit for the AICP exam. Any other graduate or undergraduate degree requires four years of experience. Not having an undergraduate degree requires eight years of professional planning experience before one can sit for the AICP exam.Exam Eligibility Requirements On April 13, 2007, the AICP Commission approved a new Certification Maintenance (CM) program. As a result, AICP certified planners must earn and report 32 credits of eligible professional development activities every two years as part of this new CM requirement. This program replaced the voluntary Continuing Professional Development (CPD) program, which terminated on April 13, 2007. Outside of the United States The recognized professional accreditation for planners in Canada is \\"MCIP,\\" signifying that the holder of the designation is a full member of the Canadian Institute of Planners. In the United Kingdom, the recognized accreditation for planners is \\"MRTPI\\", which indicates a member's chartered status in the Royal Town Planning Institute. In Australia, the recognised accreditation for planners is 'CPP' - Certified Practising Planner, which indicates a member's status in the Planning Institute of Australia - PIA In Nicaragua, the recognized accreditation for planners is 'APP' - Accredited Practicing Planner, which indicates a member's status in the Planning Institute of Nicaragua - PIN. The chairman of this institute is Alexander Alvarado.

He was born in Marseille as the son of a barrister at Aix-en-Provence. He entered the Oratory of Jesus early and became reputed as a preacher. Paris confirmed the judgment of the provinces; in 1666 he was asked to preach before the court and became a favourite of Louis XIV, who said that his eloquence was one of the few things that never grew old. In 1671, he was appointed the bishop of Tulle; eight years later he was transferred to the larger diocese of Agen. He still continued to preach regularly at court, especially for funeral orations. A panegyric on Turenne, delivered in 1675, is considered to be his masterpiece. His style is strongly tinged with pr√©ciosit√© and his chief surviving interest is as a glaring example of the evils from which Jacques- B√©nigne Bossuet delivered the French pulpit. During his later years, he devoted himself entirely to his pastoral duties at Agen where he died in 1703. Six of his most famous sermons were edited, with a biographical sketch of their author, by the Oratorian Borde in 1704.

The series loosely adapts the first two titles in the series, Viewtiful Joe and Viewtiful Joe 2, while introducing several original characters and scenarios. The series, comprising fifty-one episodes, was shown every Saturday on the Japanese television station TV Tokyo from October 2, 2004, until September 24, 2005. The show was licensed by anime distributor Geneon Entertainment, with its first twenty-six episodes airing in the United States on Kids' WB. It was taken off the air when the block was moved to The CW. Viewtiful Joe was later licensed for distribution in other parts of the world by MGM Television. The anime debuted in the United Kingdom on Jetix on July 2, 2007. Viewtiful Joe premiered on Cartoon Network Brazil on July 3, 2006, and ran again in the country's RedeTV! in HD on November 27, 2006. It aired in Mexico starting on July 4, 2006. On June 23, 2008, the show began airing on Cartoon Network in other parts of Latin America. In 2009, Viewtiful Joe became available on Crunchyroll's streaming service for its users outside Asia. Plot Following the games' storyline, movie lover Joe and his girlfriend Silvia enjoy a seemingly normal trip to the movies to see an action flick starring Joe's idol, Captain Blue, when suddenly the leader of the evil Jadow force reaches out of the screen and takes Silvia into the movie. Joe is forced to follow her by Captain Blue's mecha, Six Machine (renamed \\"Machine Six\\" in the English anime dub), and meets Captain Blue in the flesh who grants Joe the power to become an action movie hero in his own right called Viewtiful Joe. Characters * Joe: The protagonist of the series. He's a fanboy of movies who gets to live his dream as Viewtiful Joe while he saves Silvia from Jadow. He assumes his superhero outfit via the catchphrase \\"Henshin-a-Go-Go, Baby!!\\" He is often distracted by double cheeseburgers and doesn't take a lot of things seriously. * Silvia: Joe's love interest and partner. In the beginning of the series, she was abducted by Jadow for their evil plan to succeed. After Shadow's defeat, Silvia obtained a V-Watch from Captain Blue so she can team up with Joe as Sexy Silvia (in the English anime dub Go-Go Silvia) instead of being the \\"damsel-in-distress\\". * Junior: Another self-proclaimed hero worshipper like Joe, only younger. He lived in Blue Town, which was named after Captain Blue, serving as its protector Captain Blue Jr. Despite his jealousy for Joe being Blue's successor, Junior decided to become Joe's sidekick and offered his knowledge of Movieland as a helping hand. As the series progresses into the Gedow arc, Junior received the V-Yoyos from Captain Blue, assuming his new superhero outfit via the phrase \\"Henshin-a-Yo-Yo, Baby!!\\" * Captain Blue: Joe's idol and mentor. He gave Joe the V-Watch which enables him to use his VFX powers. In season two, he was transformed into the \\"Captain Blue Device\\" by the Black Emperor, which Gedow uses to create monsters. The Black Emperor gave him the scar on his face. * Alastor: An agent of Jadow that uses the nicknames \\"The Midnight Thunder Boy\\" and \\"Blade Master.\\" Though he was helping Jadow, Alastor doesn't care about their goals, but instead seeking out the ultimate battle, and can be considered an antihero to an extent. He considers himself Joe's rival, despite questioning Joe's methods. Alastor has the habit of watching over Joe during his adventures through Movieland and the two tend to act more like friends rather than enemies, becoming a perfect example of text-book frenemies. He was also the one who gave Joe the inspiration for his hero name. During Fire Leo's fight with Joe, Alastor restrained Fire Leo as they both fell into the void that surrounds Jadow headquarters, but Alastor promised to survive so he and Joe can finally settle their rivalry. Following the event Alastor lost his powers and could only restore them by a solar eclipse. During the time his power was lost, he appears in his normal form giving the heroes advice and sometimes help in fights. His power is restored to him during a solar eclipse. * Sprocket: Coordinator of Jadow and second in command of the organization. She is one of the few characters who is actually from the real world, being a member of Blue's film crew who was pulled into Movieland. She is annoyed with the antics and incompetence of Jadow's henchmen Charles III, Hulk Davidson, and Gran Bruce. When Jadow was no more, she along with Charles, Hulk, and Bruce joined up with Gedow. * Almighty Leader: The leader of Jadow, the antagonistic organization of the anime's first season. When Joe managed to get into Jadow headquarters, he found Silvia, only to see her abducted by the evil leader. Once Joe got to the stadium, \\"Almighty Leader\\" was revealed to be none other than Captain Blue, who attempted to break Joe's spirit and thus devastated Joe mentally before destroying him physically. But the words of those Joe had befriended in his adventures enabled Joe's confidence to return and fight Blue back. Piloting the King Blue giant robot, Blue was defeated by Joe in Six Majin. * The Black Emperor: Leader of the Gedow, the invading alien organization of the anime's second season whose goal is to use their various monsters and foot soldiers to corrupt a movie and alter the ending, causing the film to radiate with darkness. Pilots a battle machine. The Black Emperor is a superhero named Jet Black, Joe's father, owner of the theater and Captain Blue's best friend. He turned evil by the Black V-Watch and the Black Film. He was freed from the Black Film's corruption by Joe and Silvia. In episode 50, it is confirmed he gave Captain Blue his scar with a swipe of his blade. MediaAnime= Viewtiful Joe was produced by animation company Group TAC. The producer for the video game franchise, Atsushi Inaba, and his team gave Group TAC its character designs for the video games, as well as original character designs for the animated series. The main cast includes Tomokazu Seki, Natsuko Kuwatani, Makoto Tsumura, Mayumi Asano, Shin-ichiro Miki and Banj≈ç Ginga. The English version of the anime features voice acting by Jason Palmer, Philece Sampler, Mona Marshall, and Wendee Lee, among others. Bob Papenbrook, under the name John Smallberries, voiced Captain Blue for the show's first twenty-one English dubbed episodes. Papenbrook died on March 17, 2006, due to complications from a chronic lung condition, making Viewtiful Joe his final piece of work. He was replaced by Paul St. Peter for the remainder of the dub. The U.S. broadcast began with the fifth episode, with the first three episodes not being shown until a month later. The show's pilot was localized in the United States by phuuz entertainment. A few censoring edits were made to the English dubbed version of Viewtiful Joe. In Brazil and Spain, the show was aired completely uncut. In the English version, the name of Joe's flying machine, Six Machine, was renamed in the English dub to Machine Six. There is speculation that it was renamed because its original name sounded close to the phrase \\"sex machine\\". Also, Six Majin was renamed to Robo-Six. Joe's middle finger was edited out in his henshin transformation sequence. Silvia's super hero alter ego is renamed from \\"Sexy Silvia\\" (which was also used in the games) to \\"Go-Go Silvia\\". Sprocket's jumpsuit is always zipped up completely, though it was originally unzipped (showing large amounts of cleavage) and one of her signature moves was to zip it up. This move was eliminated in the dub by cutting out the scenes, resulting in Sprocket having much less screen time than in the original. Episodes of the series have been released on both DVD and UMD. In North America, Geneon partnered with Kids Foot Locker to promote the show by including DVDs with purchases at the shoe retailer. =CDs= Cover of Viewtiful Joe CD soundtrack The Japanese version of Viewtiful Joe features music composed by Takehiko Gokita and Yuusuke Hayashi. The show features two opening themes by the band SaGa. The song \\"Brighter Side\\" is used for the first thirty-eight episodes and the song \\"Spirit Awake\\" is used for the remaining episodes. \\"Brighter Side\\" is also used in the English version of the show. The Japanese version also features the ending theme \\"And You\\" by SaGa for the first thirty-eight episodes, and \\"Tougenkyou\\" (also known as Shangri-La Village) by Amasia Landscape for the remainder. A 36-track CD was released by Geneon on February 7, 2006, and contains the anime's music, as well as the bonus track \\"Viewtiful World\\" from the first Viewtiful Joe game. SaGa released two CD singles of their vocal songs in Viewtiful Joe. The first one was released on March 30, 2005, and features both the Japanese and English versions of \\"Brighter Side\\" and \\"And You\\", as well as a DVD containing one music clip and the opening and ending Viewtiful Joe cinematics with the respective songs. The second single was released on August 31, 2005, and features both language versions of the songs \\"Spirit Awake\\" and \\"Wonder\\", as well as a DVD music clip of the former. In North America, a CD soundtrack was packaged with the first DVD volume. =Film books= Five film books for the anime were released by Capcom in early 2005. The books consist of manga-style panels of the show's storyline shown with screenshots. Reception Geneon's press release of the third North American DVD and UMD release of Viewtiful Joe in early 2006 showed that the anime was the top-ranked show in its timeslot for the ages 2‚Äì11 Nielsen ratings demographic. Reviews of Viewtiful Joe by various media outlets mostly agreed that the show is faithful to the video games on which it is based, but complained of its animation framerates and English localization. Matt Casamassina of IGN praised the Viewtiful Joe for staying true to its source material. He states, \\"[...] the episodes never stray too far from the original subject matter. As a result, anybody who played the Joe titles will have a sense of dƒìjƒÅ vu as they watch these toons. Viewers who know the franchise's history will find no contradictions in these episodes - merely more back story, most of it entertaining.\\" Despite his appreciation for its artwork, Casamassina was displeased with the show's lack of animation. This was concurred upon by Zac Bertschy of the Anime News Network (ANN), who was also very critical of the show's English dub, giving the first DVD volume an overall \\"F\\". Specifically, he found that the localization's attempt to be hip with a nearly constant use of slang in order to cater to younger audiences resulted in a \\"insultingly bad dub\\". Carlo Santos, also of ANN, had a similar opinion, and gave the second DVD volume an overall \\"D\\". He found fault not only in the voice acting, but the script writing as well. \\"Joe's vocabulary is all, like, totally, DUDE every time he opens his mouth, and when he's not hamming it up with unconvincing slang, he's spouting lines that are supposed to sound witty but aren't.\\" Santos also noted the series as being too repetitive, but enjoyed the anime's character design, coloring, and visual style taken from the games. Buzz McClain of Video Business asserted that the show is \\"clearly influenced by the animation style of Hayao Miyazaki\\", and that its use of narrative is much more linear and easy to follow than other anime.

Rather than a serious bid for the presidency, his candidacy was speculated to instead be an attempt to garner publicity in order to help him fend-off the challenge he was facing in gubernatorial election bid later that year. On February 13 Titov traveled to the Urals for his first campaign trip. Titov failed to win the endorsement of the Union of Right Wing Forces. At a 14 March meeting of the bloc's coordinating council the question of the presidential elections was addressed.

Titov's largely ran different edits of a single advertisement throughout his campaign. This advertisement touted his gubernatorial experience. Titov urged voters to, \\"Vote not with your heart, but with your mind\\". Titov's campaign touted endorsements from State Duma deputies Sergei Yushenkov, Nikolay Brusnikin, and Hasan Mirzoev. Other Russian politician's whose endorsements they touted included Marina Salier. The campaign also touted celebrity endorsements from Rimma Kazakova, Nikolay Bederin, and Vyacheslav Dobrynin.

It is a sequel to the 1967 British film, To Sir, with Love. Like the first film, it deals with social issues in an inner city school. It was directed by Peter Bogdanovich (his first made-for-TV film) and stars Sidney Poitier reprising the role of Mark Thackeray. Plot Mark Thackeray (Sidney Poitier), from British Guiana by way of California, took a teaching position in a London East End school in the 1967 film. He spent twenty years teaching and ten in administrative roles. He has taught the children of his former pupils, and is now retiring. Thackeray's former students, Pamela Dare and Barbara Pegg (Judy Geeson and Lulu reprising their roles from the original film), come to the farewell party. Thackeray announces that he is leaving for an inner-city school in Chicago where he will teach again. In Chicago, he meets his former colleague Horace Weaver (Daniel J. Travanti) who is the principal of the school. Thackeray learns that there is an A class with good students and an H (for \\"horror\\") class for the \\"no-gooders\\". He convinces the principal to let him take the H class as, in his own admission, that is what he does best. His new pupils are noisy, unruly and engaged in destructive behaviours. As he did in London, he starts by teaching them respect for others. He addresses the pupils as Mr or Miss and their last names, and expects to be called Mr. Thackeray or Sir by them in return. Gradually, he learns their personal stories: Wilsie (Christian Payton) is a gang leader who protects his younger brother. A black female battles against double prejudice. Evie (Dana Eskelson) hides growing up without parents to avoid being fostered. A fellow teacher, Louisa Rodriguez (Saundra Santiago) admires him. It is revealed that as a teenager in British Guiana, Thackeray fell in love with a girl from Chicago. They lost contact and he went to Britain to study, became a teacher, and got married. Now a widower, Thackeray took this teaching opportunity hoping to find his earlier love. At the new school, he sets out to teach the troubled students their true potential by taking their fates in their hands. He teaches about the non- violent resistance of the historic fighters of civil rights. When he discovers Wilsie smuggling a gun into the school, he confronts him and convinces him to yield the weapon and he delivers it to the police as a found object. Later, the police pressure him to reveal the identity of the gun owner because the gun had been used to kill a police officer. He refuses and has to leave the school. Evie, who works at a newspaper, investigates Thackeray's old love, Emily Taylor (Cheryl Lynn Bruce). Evie arranges for him to meet Taylor, and also meets her son. Thackeray learns that Taylor returned his affections, but her father kept Thackeray's letters from her because she was pregnant with Thackeray's son. Thackeray learns that Wilsie is hiding because he thinks that the police are after him. He convinces Wilsie's brother to take him to the hiding place. Thackeray convinces Wilsie to give up violent gang life. After he confronts a rival gang looking for Wilsie, Wilsie and a friend with access to more firearms turn themselves in to the police. The pupils stage a \\"stand in\\" to force the principal to reinstate their beloved teacher. The term ends with a graduation ceremony and dance. Thackeray announces that he is not returning to Britain but staying in Chicago to teach the new generation.

He began studying violin at eight and began playing harmonica at aged eleven as a member of his father's band. In the 1940s, he began parallel careers as a concert soloist and recitalist, a popular radio and TV performer, and a studio musician-composer. Early life Born in Guelph, Ontario, he studied violin at eight and began playing harmonica at aged eleven as a member of his father's band. In 1935 the family moved to London. At the outbreak of the Second World War he was a student at the Leipzig Conservatory. He was arrested and interned for the duration of the war in prisoner of war camps. However it was there that he developed his virtuosity on the harmonica, basing his ideas of phrasing and interpretation on the playing of Jascha Heifetz. Career Returning to London in 1945, Reilly began championing the cause of the harmonica as a serious solo concert instrument. He began parallel careers as a concert soloist and recitalist, a popular BBC radio and TV performer, and a studio musician-composer. He performed with most of the major European orchestras and toured Europe several times with the Academy of St Martin-in- the-Fields. He also played the theme tune and musical breaks to the BBC Radio series The Navy Lark, from 1959-77. More than 30 concert works were composed for Reilly, including Michael Spivakovsky's Harmonica Concerto of 1951 and fellow Canadian Robert Farnon's Prelude and Dance for Harmonica and Orchestra. Other pieces were composed by Reilly's accompanist James Moody, (Little Suite for Harmonica and Small Orchestra, 1960) Matyas Seiber (Old Scottish Air for Harmonica, Strings and Harp), Gordon Jacob (Five Pieces for Harmonica and Strings), Fried Walter (Ballade and Tarantella for Harmonica and Orchestra), Karl Heinz-K√∂per (Concerto for Harmonica and Orchestra), Graham Whettam (Fantasy for Harmonica and Orchestra), Vilem Tausky (Concertino for Harmonica and Orchestra), Francis Ward (Kaleidoscope for Harmonica and Orchestra), Willem Strietman (\\"O bonne douce France\\" for Harmonica and Orchestra), Max Saunders (Sonatina for Harmonica and Piano), Sir George Martin (Three American Sketches for Harmonica and Strings, and Adagietto for Harmonica and Strings), Alan Langford (Concertante for Harmonica and Strings), Paul Patterson (Propositions for Harmonica and Strings). Reilly worked with many composers to get more original music written for the instrument, and his recordings also include original harmonica works by Ralph Vaughan Williams, Malcolm Arnold, Arthur Benjamin, and Villa-Lobos. He was signed to Parlophone in 1951 where his recordings were produced by George Martin. He performed music for the soundtracks of many US and European films and television series, including British comedy The Navy Lark (1959) and the TV theme tune for Dixon of Dock Green. In 1967, Reilly initiated the development of the first Hohner silver harmonica. He and James Moody have recorded many musical scores for the harmonica under the pen names \\"Dwight Barker\\" and \\"Max Martin\\". Honours In 1992 he was awarded the MBE for his services to music. Death Tommy Reilly died aged 81 in Frensham, Surrey. His granddaughter Georgina Reilly is a Canadian film and television actor.

Built in 1781 by a prominent local businessman and ship owner, it was the town's first brick mansion house. It is now owned by Historic Beverly and open to the public five days a week. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Description The John Cabot House is located in Beverly's downtown business district, on the east side of Cabot Street (its major thoroughfare) between Central Street and Franklin Place. It is a three-story timber-framed structure, its exterior clad in red brick and capped by a truncated hip roof. The main facade is five bays wide, with windows set in rectangular openings with splayed soldier brick headers. Projecting brick courses separate the floors, and the third-floor windows are smaller in height, and butt against the elaborate dentillated roof cornice. The main entrance projects slightly in a surround that includes sidelight windows, pilasters, and a corniced entablature. The interior has a typical central stair plan, and retains most of its original woodwork, which is in a heavy late Georgian style. History The house was built in 1781, and was the first brick mansion in Beverly. It was built for shipowner and privateer Capt. John Cabot (b. 1745 in Salem to Joseph Cabot and Elizabeth Higginson). Cabot was prominent in the town's economy, having also cofounded the Beverly Cotton Manufactory, America's first cotton mill. In 1802, the house became the first office of the Beverly Bank, the tenth oldest bank in America, with Capt. John Cabot serving as one of seven original directors. At that time, it was extended to the rear by a two-story wood-frame addition. In addition to period rooms, the John Cabot House features maritime, military, and children's exhibits as well as major changing exhibits. Historic Beverly's research facilities are also located here.

It is about west of Bicester and north of Kidlington. The village consists of two neighbourhoods: Tackley itself, and Nethercott. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 998. Archaeology The course of Akeman Street Roman road passes through the parish just south of the village. Manor Tackley has existed since Saxon times. After the Norman Conquest of England William the Conqueror granted the manor of Tackley to Hugh d'Avranches, 1st Earl of Chester. The Manor House was built in 1657 and Tackley Park, also known as Hill Court, was built late in the 17th century. Both houses have been demolished but their outbuildings, including a thatched barn and two dovecotes, remain. Another 17th-century house, Court Farm (or Base Court), still survives but its interior was completely remodelled in the 1950s. Court Farm is near the site of a 12th-century moated house, and has a set of 17th century fish ponds, constructed by John Harborne (1582‚Äì1651), a wealthy merchant from the Middle Temple who purchased the manor of Tackley in 1612, and had embarked on creating there a new mansion with an elaborate water garden. The remains of one square and two triangular ponds, no doubt originally containing fish, are visible today. The manor lay on a tributary of the River Cherwell, and Harborne may well have been a fisherman. He was a friend of the publisher John Jackson, who published in 1623 a plan of Harborne's water garden in its completed state, by Gervase Markham in the third edition of his Cheape and good husbandry for the well-ordering of all beasts, and fowles, and for the generall cure of their diseases.Markham's book was first published 1616 by Roger Jackson. The third edition shows a woodcut diagram entitled \\"A platforme for ponds, which the printer hath added to the ensuing discourse for the better satisfaction and delight of such as having a convenient plot of ground for the same purpose shall be desirous to make any ponds for increase and store of fish\\" (Bibliotheca Piscatoria, p. 145). Churches St Nicholas' parish church: blocked 11th-century Saxon arcade on the north side of the nave St Nicholas' parish church: 17th-century date stone under the chancel gable =Church of England= The Church of England parish church of Saint Nicholas is cruciform. It dates from the 11th century and has several remnants of its original Saxon stonework. The south aisle, east windows and lower part of the tower are 13th century. In the 15th century the Perpendicular Gothic clerestory and upper part of the tower were built and both transepts were rebuilt. The north transept was rebuilt again in 1616 as a family chapel for John Harbourne. In 1862 lightning struck and damaged the church, and in 1864 the Oxford Diocesan architect, the Gothic Revivalist G.E. Street directed a restoration of St. Nicholas' that the 20th century critics Jennifer Sherwood and Nikolaus Pevsner called \\"rather insensitive\\". The church tower has a ring of six bells.Oxford Diocesan Guild of Church Bell ringers, Witney and Woodstock Branch Richard Keene of Woodstock cast the fifth and tenor bells in 1664 and the third bell in 1689. John Warner and Sons of Cripplegate, London cast the second and fourth bells in 1859. Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the treble bell in 1924. There is also a Sanctus bell that was cast by an unknown founder in 1792. In the 12th century both Osney Abbey and Eynsham Abbey acquired lands in the parish. Eynsham Abbey's holdings in Tackley included the watermill at Catsham (see below). However, by the time Thomas Cromwell made the Valor Ecclesiasticus for King Henry VIII in 1535, both abbeys had ceased to hold any property in the parish. From 1725 every Rector of Tackley was also a fellow of St John's College, Oxford. Several were distinguished scholars but most had several other parishes and were absentee rectors of Tackley. Since 1976 St. Nicholas' has belonged to a united Church of England Benefice with the neighbouring parishes of North Aston and Steeple Aston. =Methodist= Tackley Methodist church was converted from a barn built of local limestone and dedicated in 1808. A brick extension was added in the 1840s. Tackley's Anglicans and Methodists hold monthly ecumenical services together. Economic and social historyMill and bridge= The Domesday Book records that in 1086 there was a watermill, Catsham Mill, on the River Cherwell between Tackley and Northbrook to the north. A second mill had been built at Catsham by 1176. A stream between Tackley and Nethercott was being used to power an overshot mill by 1622. In 1767 it was still in use and was called Pullback Mill, but it was disused by the 1840s. There was a bridge over the Cherwell at Catsham Mill. It was first recorded in 1338, needed repair by 1444 and had been replaced by a ford by 1617. A wooden bridge replaced it around 1637 and a stone bridge had been built again by 1750. Today neither the bridge nor Catsham Mill survive. =Land tenure= Tackley village The parish originally shared a single open field system but later these were separated into two open field systems, one for each Tackley and Nethercott. Tackley's fields were enclosed in the 16th and 17th centuries but open-field farming survived in Nethercott until 1873. The landowners rejected enclosure proposals in 1849, 1853 and 1861. A scheme was finally agreed in 1873 and a Parliamentary Enclosure Act was passed for the parish. Balliol College, Oxford owned land at Nethercott and was one of the landowners who objected to the earlier enclosure proposals. Soon after the act was finally passed the college sold its holdings there. St. John's College, Oxford also owned land at Nethercott and objected to the earlier enclosure proposals. It sold its land to Corpus Christi College, Oxford in 1948 and 1953. A map of 1608 records a hamlet at Whitehill, south of Tackley village. Its lands were enclosed by Act of Parliament in 1795 and the hamlet seems to have quickly disappeared thereafter. =17th and 18th centuries= A narrowboat near Pigeon's Lock on the Oxford Canal The earliest known record of a public house in Tackley dates from 1624. In 1774 the village had four public houses: the Ball, the Chequers, the Pole Axe and the Wheatsheaf. The Gardiner Arms dates from at least 1788 and the King's Arms in Nethercott was in business by the 1840s. Today the King's Arms is a private house and only the Gardiner Arms remains open. During the English Civil War in the 1640s a skirmish, \\"The Battle of Tackley\\", was fought on the banks of the River Cherwell. In 1787 the Oxford Canal was extended from Banbury down the Cherwell valley as far south as Northbrook lock, north of Tackley. In 1788 the canal was extended past Tackley to the outskirts of Oxford. =19th century= Sturdy's Castle public house, on the A4260 road just over southwest of the village Early in the 19th century Tackley had two dame schools. In 1840 a National School was built on a site provided by St. John's College, Oxford. It was extended in 1861. In 1927 it was reorganised as a junior school, and senior pupils had to travel to Steeple Aston. It also became a Church of England controlled school. A new school building replaced the original one in 1965, but the school was closed in 1981. The Oxford and Rugby Railway between and was built past the village in 1848-1849 but the nearest rail station provided was , which was actually at the hamlet of Enslow south of Tackley. The Great Western Railway took over the Oxford and Rugby Railway before the line opened, but did not open a halt for the village until 1931. It is at Nethercott but was named Tackley Halt. It is now called Tackley and is served by Great Western Railway's Oxford Canal Line services. A stone quarry was opened at Whitehill in the latter part of the 19th century had closed by the middle of the 20th. It now contains wildlife for which it has been designated a site of special scientific interest. =20th century= Since 2004 Tackley Village Hall has also housed a community shop and Post Office Tackley Football Club was founded in 1907.Tackley Football Club It plays in Witney and District Football Association Division Two.Witney and District Football Association Tackley also has a Cricket Club. The village, and especially the Nethercott neighbourhood, has expanded considerably since the railway station opened in 1931. It has evolved from a primarily agricultural community into one with a significant commuter population. In the south of the parish on Whitehill overlooking the River Cherwell is a satellite ground station that the Marconi Company built for Mercury Communications in 1986. Mercury was absorbed by its parent company Cable & Wireless in 1997, which continues to operate the station. Tackley's last shops closed in 2001, so in 2004 the community opened a shop and post office, which share premises with the village hall and are partly staffed by volunteers.The Plunkett Foundation Air crash On Thursday 13 July 2006 a Royal Air Force Harrier GR9 aircraft flying from RAF Cottesmore to RAF Fairford crashed about west of Tackley, near Sturdy's Castle public house. It would appear that the pilot having had a problem, and seeing Woodstock ahead, managed to turn around and eject at a very low height. The pilot ejected and survived uninjured. An off-duty policeman who was driving close to the scene of the crash suffered shock when his car was hit by debris. The Oxford ‚Äî Banbury A4260 road was closed for several days as the crash was investigated and a team from MOD St Athan removed the wreckage.

He fought for the Parliamentary cause for the first and second English Civil Wars before changing allegiance and fighting for King Charles II during the Third Civil War. During the Interregnum, he was active for the Royalist cause. After the Restoration, he was knighted and was active in public life, as a member of parliament and occasionally in military and administrative affairs. Early life Edward Massey was the fifth son of John Massey of Coddington, Cheshire and his wife Anne Grosvenor, daughter of Richard Grosvenor of Eaton, Cheshire. cites: Burke, Commoners, iii. 45‚Äì47; Ormerod, Cheshire, ii. 731-2. He may have been a London apprentice before serving in the Dutch army against the armies of Philip III of Spain, who ruled the Spanish Netherlands (see Dutch Revolt). In 1639, he appears as a captain of pioneers in the army raised by Charles I of England to fight against the Scots. At the outbreak of the English Civil War, he was with the King at York, but he soon joined the Parliamentary army. Parliamentary soldier As lieutenant colonel under the Earl of Stamford, Massey became deputy governor of Gloucester, where he remained till towards the end of the First Civil War, becoming governor early in 1643. He conducted minor operations against numerous small bodies of Royalists, and conducted the defence of Gloucester against the King's main army, in August 1643, with great steadiness and ability, receiving the thanks of parliament and a grant of ¬£1,000 for his services. In 1644, Massey continued to keep the field and to disperse the local Royalists, and on several occasions he measured swords with Prince Rupert. In May 1644, he was made general of the forces of the Western Association. In 1645, he took the offensive against Lord Goring and the western Royalists, advanced to the relief of Taunton, and in the autumn cooperated effectively with Sir Thomas Fairfax and the New Model Army in the Langport campaign. After taking part in the desultory operations that closed the first war, he was elected Member of Parliament for Wootton Bassett. Royalist soldier Massey then began to take an active part in politics on the Presbyterian side, and was one of the generals who was impeached by the army on the grounds that they were attempting to revive the Civil War in the Presbyterian interests. He fled England in June 1647 and, though he resumed his seat in the house in 1648, he was again excluded by Pride's Purge, and after a short imprisonment escaped to Holland. Thence, taking the side of Royalists openly and definitely. Like many other Presbyterians, he accompanied Charles II to Scotland. He fought against Cromwell's army at the bridge of Stirling and Inverkeithing, and commanded the advanced guard of the Royalist army in the invasion of England in 1651. It was hoped that Massey's influence would win over the towns of the Severn valley to the cause of the King, and the march of the army on Worcester was partly inspired by this expectation. At the Battle of Worcester, he was seriously wounded, and when Massey realised that his wounds were dangerously slowing King Charles II down during his escape, he persuaded Charles to continue without him, although the king was reluctant to leave him. Massey was arrested and imprisoned in the Tower of London. He again managed to escape to Holland. While negotiating with the English Presbyterians for the restoration of Charles, he visited England twice, in 1654 and 1656. He was arrested in England for his part in Booth's Uprising in 1659, but was able to escape for a third time. After his escape, while hiding in London, he encouraged the discontent that led to the soldier's mutiny over pay on 1 February 1660. cites: DNB; Clarendon, Rebellion, iii. 130; v. 537; Thurloe, iii. 165, 177‚Äì178; D. Underdown, Royalist Conspiracy, 261-4, 309. Restoration In 1660, Massey was elected MP for Gloucester in the Convention Parliament, and was active in preparing for Charles's return. He was awarded a knighthood on 27 May 1660 and a grant of ‚Ç§3,000. In 1661, he was re-elected MP for Gloucester in the Cavalier Parliament. The rest of his life was spent in political, and occasionally in military and administrative business. He was unmarried, and died in 1674 at Abbeyleix in Ireland, where he had been granted the manor . cites: Grey, ii. 119, 385-6; Portland mss. BL Loan 29/83, Strettell to Harley, 5 Dec. 1674. He was a close friend of the leading judge Sir Jerome Alexander, another Englishman who had settled in Ireland; Alexander at his death in 1670 left Massey a number of valuables, such as \\"my cane with the silver head of a rhinoceros\\".

It is concluded by its sequel, The Seven Hills. Plot summary The novel opens at the alternate close of the Second Punic War. Hannibal offers terms to the Romans: abandon their city and move north of the Alps, or be destroyed. The Romans, under the dictator Quintus Fabius Maximus, accept the offer and withdraw into Germania, vowing to return. The Carthaginians declare victory and go home. One chapter and several generations later, the Romans have long since reestablished their republic. These Romans, largely out of need, have adopted a practice of Cultural Romanization more pronounced than the historical Romans did: large numbers of Germans have been adopted into the Roman society, forming a large proportion of both the legions and the Senate. A series of auspicious omens prompt the Senate to send a delegation south into Latium. The expedition leaders are subtly but immediately at cross purposes: the commander, Marcus Scipio, a scion of the ancient patrician Cornelii Scipiones family, is wholly motivated by a desire to reestablish the Republic in the Mediterranean basin. His deputy, Titus Norbanus, one of the newer, Germanic Romans, seeks personal glory, at least in part to ensure that the Germans (particularly his own family) remain as powerful within the expanded Republic as they do under the current scheme. It quickly becomes clear to the Romans that generations of constant warfare in Germania have strengthened them, whereas the Carthaginians have grown soft in the absence of real opposition. The Republic quickly begins playing the Carthaginians off against the Egyptians, the only other serious power in the Mediterranean, reclaiming Latium in the process. At the close of the novel, the Egyptian army, led by Scipio and armed with fearsome weapons from the School of Archimedes from the Library of Alexandria, outlasts the Carthaginian force, which hurriedly retreats upon hearing the news of the Roman reconquest of Italy. The four Roman legions led by Norbanus, technically Carthaginian auxiliaries, decide to ignore Scipio's offer to join him in Alexandria, and chart their own path to Rome. Characters *Marcus Scipio: Leader of Roman Expedition to Carthage and Egypt *Titus Norbanus: Second in command of Roman Expedition *Aulus Flaccus: Senator and diplomat, assistant and friend to Marcus Scipio *Selene II: Queen and Regent of Egypt *Hamilcar II: Shofet of Carthage *Princess Zarabel: Sister of Hamilcar, leader of the Cult of Tanit Major themes As with Roberts's historical SPQR series, Hannibal's Children and its sequel The Seven Hills explore the decline of the Republic in the face of ambition. In the former, the Caesars and in the latter Norbanus aggressively pursue power for its own sake, in the process exposing weaknesses in the Republic.

It is located close to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Chapel Hill High School is part of the Chapel Hill-Carrboro City Schools district which contains two other high schools, Carrboro High School and East Chapel Hill High School. History The original Chapel Hill High School was located on Franklin Street until, due to desegregation efforts of the mid-1960s, the school was demolished in favor of the construction of a new high school across town.\\"A Thousand Words\\" column by Jock Lauterer, \\"Chapel Hill High School, 1962\\", The Carrboro Citizen, December 24, 2008, pg. 8 White Chapel Hill High School merged with the black Lincoln High School to form the new Chapel Hill High School. Lincoln High School, which closed in 1966, had award-winning football and band programs. In particular, its 1961 football team won the state championship without a single point being scored against it all year and averaging over 40 points per game, an incredible feat. Renovation in progress in summer 2020 A major ($70 million) renovation began in June 2018, including constructing new buildings. Academics In 1999, Chapel Hill High School was listed as one of the top-performing U.S. high schools in The Wall Street Journal (October 15, 1999), for \\"the best student performance over the past 10 years based on SAT, achievement-test and standardized-test scores.\\" In 2005, 62.5% of students took the SAT and scored an average of 1156 compared to a state average of 1008. Similarly, 97.3% of the student body has taken the PSAT, and scored an average of 155 compared to the state average of 133. Also, 69.2% (306 students) have participated in Advanced Placement (AP) examinations with 73.5% of all scores scoring above a 3. As of 2005, Chapel Hill High School also has a high graduation rate of 94.7%. In 2005, 94.7% of students were proficient on State English I tests, and 93.1% of students were proficient on State Algebra I tests. The school posted the third highest average SAT score in the Raleigh Durham area: 1754 with 87.9% of students taking the test. Athletics Chapel Hill High School has around 20 athletic teams. In the fall, the school offers cheerleading, cross country, field hockey, football, men's soccer, women's tennis, ultimate frisbee, volleyball, and women's golf. In the winter, the school offers cheerleading, men's basketball, women's basketball, swimming and diving, and wrestling. In the spring, the school offers men's golf, men's lacrosse, women's soccer, softball, men's tennis, track, baseball, and women's lacrosse. Chapel Hill High School has won many state championships in athletics such as back to back trophies in the 3A Men‚Äôs Soccer in 2017 and 2018, and their 3A Women‚Äôs Soccer program winning in 2018, tying the state record for number of goals allowed with 2. The arts Chapel Hill High has performing and visual arts programs. The school has a marching band, jazz band, symphonic band, concert band, orchestra, percussion ensemble, drama program, and several choruses. Schedule change Before the 2006-07 school year, the high school used a six-period schedule. However, during the 2006-07 school year, a new controversial seven-period schedule was introduced. A mostly student-led protest organized sit downs with several members of the school board in order to avoid the change into a block schedule. After long talks between the two parties, the school board altered their plan to the now seven-period day. Controversy During the 2007-2008 school year, a cheating ring was discovered inside the school. Several students had been in possession of a master key which they had used to repeatedly enter the school and teacher's rooms in order to access and photocopy tests and answer keys. The resulting answers were then used by these students to score higher on exams. The answer keys were usually stored on cell phones and passed or sent around between members of the group. Some colleges then contacted the school seeking information about who was involved such that the perpetrators could have their admissions revoked. However, only local colleges got in touch with the school, so most of the 11 implicated students managed to avoid harsh punishment. The master key copies had been in existence for about two years before anyone was caught. To avoid the possibility of some of the copies not being confiscated, all of the school's doors were re-keyed and the new keys are being held under closer supervision. The cost of this re-keying has been estimated at several thousand dollars. On April 15, 2010, a student brought a gun on a school bus and accidentally shot it at the ground. No one was hurt, but the school and several nearby schools went on lockdown. The student was later arrested.

The book was illustrated by noted author and illustrator Maurice Sendak. Fred Inglis, in his book The Promise of Happiness: Value and Meaning in Children's Fiction, writes that the book invokes the ancient pieties and the values of the old world and makes them \\"imaginable in the new.\\" Plot summary Lina is one of six school children in the small fishing village of Shora. When she writes an essay for school that asks why there are no storks in their village, she sets all the others to wondering. Their teacher encourages the class to find out for themselves. The children set out to bring the storks back. They have to overcome many obstacles. They discovered that the roofs on the village's homes are pitched so steeply that the storks cannot find space to nest on the sharp ridges, and placing a wagon wheel on each roof ridge would give storks a place to nest. The task of finding a wagon wheel in the tiny village proves difficult, and the children meet several interesting personalities during their search. This simple, yet compelling plot teaches that if people think and wonder why, things will begin to happen and dreams will come true. The schoolchildren are: Lina, the only girl in the small school; Jella, the biggest of all the children; Auka, an average boy; Eelka, who is fat and awkward; and Pier and Dirk, the inseparable twins. These six kids are aided by their teacher, Grandmother Sibble III, legless Janus, old Douwa, and the \\"tin man\\".

The strip was published in the comics magazine The Beezer. Denis Gifford in his Encyclopedia of Comic Characters (1987) attributes his creation to \\"Carmichael.\\" These days he occasionally appears in the reprint Classics from the Comics series. Concept Colonel Blink, whose name was a pun on Colonel Blimp, is a former military colonel who is short-sighted. Many of the one-page gags are about his bluff, no-nonsense treatment of people and situations that are a result of him not being able to see or discern what is going on around him. With the usual comic disregard for foolish internal consistencies, every other story involved his driving down the road in a car that had obviously seen the dawn of the Edwardian era. Although Blink was \\"known to the police\\" for various misdemeanours involving often lunatic examples of mistaken identity he was never pulled over for dangerous driving. The charm of the stories lies in the utter lack of malice in Colonel Blink: the madcap adventures are an escalating sequence of disasters based on innocent and often very well-meaning intent. The character is referred to as a colonel in the strip's title but the character having been in the army is rarely mentioned in the strip's itself. However, one strip refers to the character's time in the military and says he became a colonel, but leaves a lot of questions unanswered. In another, it mentions that he had an old war wound that still required attention by a doctor, although whether this was the reason for him leaving the army was never explained. Side characters * \\"Auntie\\", his ever-patient housekeeper, and who, despite her name was obviously considerably younger than the Colonel * Rover the dog, who needs to be even more patient as he's often mistaken for lions, bears, rugs or insurance salesmen * Next-door neighbour Cartright, often the innocent victim of some misunderstanding or other (him being accidentally covered in grass clippings leads Blink to shout approvingly: \\"Got a monkey to cut the hedge, eh Cartright?

He was born in 1937 and is of German origin. He returned into office in 1995. He is a member of the Federation Council of Russia. Childhood and war Eduard Rossel was born in Bor, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast to Volga German parents. His father was executed by the NKVD in 1938 and he was left living with his mother, who at that time found a Ukrainian man and married him instead. Rossel's original language was German, but due to his mother's marriage to a Soviet national, the German language was abandoned and Russian kicked in. He lived with his mother and stepfather until 1942, when both of his parents were sent to labor camps in Ukhta. He lived completely alone for three days, until a neighbor took him in. Realizing that she had many children to feed, he decided in fall 1942 to leave, taking along a bag and pocket knife. He went to a train station, and while the train guard wasn't looking, sneaked into it and remained there until the train reached Kirov. There, he went out and decided to beg for food because he was hungry but the Soviet militsiya captured him and sent Rossel to a children penal colony. He escaped the colony three days later, returned to the station and took the train to Verkhnekamsk. Rossel's mother was released in October 1947, and she reunited with him the same year. Following the reunion, mother and child moved to Gerd-Iol, a city on the outskirts of Ukhta, Komi Republic. Rossel attended first grade and after attending school for seven years, decided to attend the Agricultural TVET in Syktyvkar but was denied such option because of his German roots. In 1962, Rossel graduated from the Ural State Mining University. He also holds a PhD in Technical Sciences and a doctoral degree in Economics and is an academician of the Russian Academy of Engineering and of the International Academy of Regional Cooperation and Development. Career Prior to his career, Eduard Rossel made up his mind that he should never skip a single promotion. Prior to his political career, he was the head of the Sreduralstroy, an Ural based company. In 1974, Rossel met Boris Yeltsin (who in 1991 was elected as the first President of Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union) at the metallurgy factory, Blooming-1500. During that time, Rossel already worked as head engineer of the Tagilstroy Trust, which was under the control of Alexei Kosygin. In 1978, Eduard Rossel declined promotion from Boris Yeltsin, who wanted him to become a mayor of Nizhny Tagil. A few days after his election as mayor, Rossel got a visit from Alexander Avdonin, a geologist and local historian, who back then discovered, along with Geliy Ryabov, the burial site of the Romanov Dynasty. He served as a governor of the Sverdlovsk Oblast from 1991 to 2009. Rossel supported Boris Yeltsin during his rise to power. Yeltsin and Rossel became more hostile for a time due to Rossel's demand that Sverdlovsk Oblast have a status equal to that of Russia's republics. Rossel eventually returned to Yeltsin's favor, and in January 1996 Rossel won passage of a special bilateral agreement between Moscow and Sverdlovsk. In 2005, Eduard Rossel awarded his successor, Alexey Vorobyov, the Order of Merit for the Fatherland, 3rd class. In 2009, Rossel left the gubernatorial post, citing his own failed competency. In 2018, Eduard Rossel met with vice governor of Sverdlovsk Oblast Aleksey Orlov, finance minister Victoria Kazakova, director of trust company \\"Belaya Gora\\", and head of the administration of Nizhniy Tagil, Vladislav Pinaev to discuss whether Belaya Gora should become a tourist resort. The plan is to create a ski resort with the help from the Canadian company Ecosign.

John Hale Farm, is a historic Colonial house located at 39 Hale Street, Beverly, Massachusetts. The house is now operated as a nonprofit museum by Historic Beverly, with period furnishings and a room containing witchcraft-related artifacts. This house was built in 1694, possibly with structural members from an earlier parsonage, by Beverly's first minister, Rev. John Hale (1636‚Äì1700). Hale is now best remembered for playing a significant part in the infamous Salem witch trials in 1692. He had been at the forefront of the prosecutions but underwent a change of heart when his second wife Sarah Noyes Hale was accused of witchcraft. She was not convicted, and shortly thereafter the trials concluded. After his wife's death in 1697, Rev. Hale wrote a book entitled A Modest Inquiry into the Nature of Witchcraft, condemning his colleagues who played leading roles in the trials. Rev. Hale lived in this house until his death on May 15, 1700. Generations of descendants succeeded him in the house, until in 1937 they finally sold it to the Beverly Historical Society & Museum. Over the years the house was much altered from its original state. Additions include a 1745 gambrel-roofed ell facing Hale Street that now contains the main entrance.

In the mid-1880s, she took part in the search for the Greely Expedition. Captained by Michael Healy of the United States Revenue Cutter Service (later part of the U.S. Coast Guard), she worked the 20,000-mile coastline of Alaska. She later assisted with relief efforts after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Her services also included the second expedition of Admiral Richard E.

Bear served as a revenue cutter in the United States Revenue-Marine from 1885 to 1894 and the United States Revenue Cutter Service from 1894 to 1915 and as a cutter in the United States Coast Guard from 1915 to 1926. Throughout the years from 1885 to 1926, she made the seasonal trek each May from her port in Oakland, California, to sail north to the waters of the Territory of Alaska for the five-month season, cruising on the Bering Sea Patrol, where she looked out for seal poachers, shipwrecked whalers, and illicit trade with Alaska Natives, ferried reindeer from Siberia to Alaska, and served as a floating courthouse. By order of the United States Department of the Treasury, Bear was given free run to arrest and seize possessions of poachers, smugglers, and illegal traders, as well as take census of people and ships, record geological and astronomical information, take note of tides, and escort whaling ships. One captain of Bear, Michael \\"Hell Roaring Mike\\" Healy, was considered a savior by many of the whalers and native Eskimos, as he bought Siberian reindeer at his own expense for the starving natives to use as the foundation for a new herd in Alaska, paralleling, and possibly in cooperation with, missionary Sheldon Jackson. Healy was the first African- American commissioned officer in U.S. history, and during Captain Healy's and Bears 1891 Bering Sea Patrol, the following was accomplished: * secured witnesses for a murder trial * ferried reindeer * sailed the Alaskan governor * transported a U.S. geographical survey team * carried lumber and supplies for school construction in remote areas * delivered teachers to their remote assignments * delivered mail for the U.S. Post Office Department * enforced federal laws * provided medical support to natives * conducted search and rescueA Bear of a sea story, Coast Guard Compass: Official Blog of the U.S. Coast Guard, , February 12, 2013. During one of its yearly trips back to San Francisco, Bear assisted in rescue operations for 1906 San Francisco earthquake. The Revenue Cutter Service was merged with the United States Life- Saving Service to form the United States Coast Guard on 28 January 1915 and the ship was renamed USCGC Bear. Bear of Oakland Cruising to Alaska for her last patrol in the 1926 season, on her return to Oakland that November she was replaced by a new cutter, and ownership was transferred to the city for use as a large barquentine-rigged museum ship,The (Washington) Evening Star, March 27, 1927, p. 1 Bear starred as the sealer Macedonia in the 1930 film version of Jack London's The Sea-Wolf. In 1932 Bear of Oakland was purchased by Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd for $1,050, as a replacement for the barquentine . He used her in the Second Byrd Expedition alongside the old steel-hulled lumber ship Pacific Fir, renamed by Byrd , in honor of the New York brewer who was a major sponsor of expedition. After the expedition, Admiral Byrd leased Bear to the Navy for one dollar a year, for use on his government sponsored (third) expedition. United States Antarctic Service Expedition On 11 September 1939 she was re-commissioned in the U.S. Navy for service during the 1939‚Äì1941 United States Antarctic Service Expedition, led by Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd, and renamed USS Bear (AG-29). She carried a Barkley-Grow seaplane on board.http://antarcticsun.usap.gov/pastIssues/2004-2005/2004_11_28.pdf Lieutenant Commander Richard H. Cruzen was captain of Bear during the expedition. Cruzen would rise to the rank of rear admiral and commanded the U.S. Navy ships which participated in a large Antarctic expedition named Operation Highjump in 1948. In early 1941, USS Bear assisted in the evacuation of the members of the Antarctic Expedition, as international tensions rose in the months that led up to America's entrance into World War II. Bear arrived at the Mikkelsen Islands, just north of the Antarctic Circle, on 16 March 1941, and its crew helped to build an adequate airstrip to evacuate personnel and equipment from the expedition base in the area. World War II USS Bear circa 1944 From 1941 to 1944, Bear served in the Northeast Atlantic Greenland Patrol. The rigging was cut down to two masts to become a fully motorized ship. After the capture, on 12 September 1941, of the German-controlled Norwegian sealer , which was used as a supply ship for secret weather stations, by ; Bear towed the prize to Boston. When more modern ships were available to replace her, Bear was decommissioned on 17 May 1944 and laid up in Boston until the end of the war. Bear had the distinction of being the oldest U.S. Navy ship to be deployed outside the continental United States during World War II. She was one of the last ships equipped with sails to serve in a theater of war. She was also one of a very few U.S. Navy ships to have served during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War as well as both world wars. (The sailing relics and were both in active commissioned service during World War II but neither left port during the war.) Postwar Bear was purchased from the U.S. government in 1948 by Frank M. Shaw of Halifax, Nova Scotia for $5,199. Shaw intended to use the ship for sealing. Renamed Arctic Bear, her refit for sealing proved costly and with the decline of the large-scale Newfoundland seal hunt, she was laid up in Halifax Harbour subject to on and off again refits, and lay derelict for periods of times as she remained at various moorings around Halifax and Dartmouth. By the early 1960s Bear was considered for restoration as a museum ship by the City of Dartmouth as well as her old home at Oakland and by the San Francisco marine museum.\\"Famed Exploration Ship May Be Marine Museum\\", Halifax Mail, 28 March 1982 However the purchase price from Shaw Steamships and the extensive restoration costs scuttled museum plans.\\"Bear Project Scuttled. Vessel Refit Too Costly\\", Chronicle Herald, 19 April 1962 In 1962 she was purchased by Alfred Johnston of Philadelphia for a floating seafood restaurant.Bixby, William , Track of the Bear, p. 285 Repairs were made to the ship at Industrial Shipping Limited in Mahone Bay, Nova Scotia for her new role including the carving of a new bear figurehead. Sinking In 1963, while in tow by the tug Irving Birch to Philadelphia, Bear foundered about east of Cape Sable Island, Nova Scotia, at . She went down early in the morning of 19 March 1963 after a gale struck and severed the tow line. The mast collapsed and punctured the hull, causing the sinking. Her crew of two were rescued by Irving Birch. Legacy Bears career lasted for 89 years. She spent a total of 47 years in commissioned service of the United States Revenue Cutter Service, Coast Guard and Navy. She was one of only a few ships to have served in both polar regions. She is also one of the very few ships to be on active service in the U.S. Armed Forces during the Spanish-American War, World War I and World War II. There is a large detailed scale model of Bear on display in the Stockton Center for International Law, part of the United States Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island. The figurehead from Bear is in the collection at the Mariners' Museum in Newport News, Virginia. The mascot of the United States Coast Guard Academy is Objee the bear, inspired by the Coast Guard Cutter Bear. The athletic teams of the Coast Guard Academy are called the Coast Guard Bears.

The airport has a diverse international history and has been known by a variety of names. It was originally built in 1923 as an Italian air force base called . It became a German air base during World War II. The airbase was captured by the British 8th Army in January 1943 and transferred to the control of the US Army Air Forces, who called it Mellaha AAF until 1945, when they renamed it Wheelus Air Base for a US airman killed that year. American use continued until the 1969 Libyan coup d'√©tat and the subsequent expiration of the lease. When the Americans left, the base was renamed Okba Ben Nafi Air Base (ŸÇÿßÿπÿØÿ© ÿπŸÇÿ®ÿ© ÿ®ŸÜ ŸÜÿßŸÅÿπ ÿßŸÑÿ¨ŸàŸäÿ©) after the Islamic general who conquered North Africa. It was used by both the Libyan and Soviet air forces. The United States bombed the base in 1986 during Operation El Dorado Canyon. In 1995, the air base was converted to a second civilian airport for Tripoli, and was given its current name.  History  The airport was originally built in 1923 by the Italian Air Force as Mellaha Air Base (ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÑÿßŸëÿ≠ÿ©). A motor racing circuit was subsequently built around the airport and Mellaha Lake began hosting the popular Tripoli Grand Prix in 1933. Mellaha was used by the German Luftwaffe during the North African Campaign, with the Germans using it for short range recon units, as well as coastal and naval recon units. Special weather recon units also existed at Mehalla. The main Luftwaffe unit stationed at the base was the 2nd Staffel of the Aufkl√§rungsgruppe (H) 14 or 2.(H)/14. The squadron was equipped with twelve single-engined Henschel Hs 126, an aircraft with 2-man crews, which could cover approx 710 km, with a maximum speed of 360 km/h, as well as three Fieseler Fi 156 Storch liaison aircraft, and a Junkers Ju 52 for transport of men and materiel. The airbase was captured by the British 8th Army in January 1943. The US Army Air Force began using Mellaha as a base in January 1943. It was used by the 376th Bombardment Group (Heavy) of the 12th Air Force for B-24 bomb missions into Italy and southern parts of Germany. In addition, Mellaha Field was used by Air Transport Command. It functioned as a stopover en route to Benina Airport near Benghazi or to Tunis Airport, Tunisia on the North African Cairo-Dakar transport route for cargo, transiting aircraft and personnel.:File:Atcroutes-1sep1945.jpg On 15 April 1945 Mellaha AAF was taken over by USAAF's Air Training Command. It was renamed Wheelus Army Air Field (AAF) on 17 May 1945 in honor of USAAF Lieutenant Richard Wheelus who had died earlier that year in a plane crash in Iran. During the USAFs tenure the base was extended, demolishing the derelict motor racing buildings. A 1954 agreement with Libya extended use of the base until 1971, but changing needs led the United States to withdraw completely by 1970, handing the facility over to the new Libyan government that had taken power a year earlier in the 1969 Libyan coup d'√©tat. = Libyan/Soviet use = After the US Air Force left in 1970, the base was renamed Okba Ben Nafi Air Base (seemingly after the legendary hero Uqba ibn Nafi) and served as a Libyan People's Air Force (LPAF) installation. OBN AB housed the LPAF's headquarters and a large share of its major training facilities. In addition, aircraft and personnel of the Soviet Air Force took up residence at the base. LPAF Soviet- made MiG-17/19/25 fighters and Tu-22 bombers were based at Okba Ben Nafi Air Base. Of the combat aircraft, the US State Department estimated in 1983 that fifty percent remained in storage, including most of the MiG fighters and Tu-22 bombers. = Operation El Dorado Canyon = Ilyushin Il-76 targeted in the bombing of 1986. In 1986, the base was a primary target of Operation El Dorado Canyon, a US retaliatory air strike against Libya for missile attacks on US aircraft over disputed territorial waters in the Mediterranean Sea and Libyan involvement in terrorist attacks on US servicemen in Europe.Flashback: The Berlin disco bombing. BBC on 13 November 2001. At 2 a.m. on 16 April 1986, Okba Ben Nafi AB, various Libyan government buildings, and three of thirty alleged Libyan terrorist training camps were bombed by F-111Fs from the USAFE's 48th Tactical Fighter Wing, flying non-stop from RAF Lakenheath, United Kingdom, to Libya. Operation El Dorado Canyon included eighteen 48 TFW F-111F \\"Aardvark\\" fighter-bombers (Pave Tack-equipped), five EF-111A \\"Sparkvarks\\" from the 66th Electronic Combat Wing/42nd Electronic Combat Squadron at RAF Upper Heyford, UK, and carrier-based US Navy F-14 Tomcats and A-6E Intruders. The 66 ECW Sparkvarks formed up with the attack force to provide electronic defense during the attack. One 48 TFW F-111F was lost outbound from the attack to (presumably) a SAM or AAA hit. The 48 TFW that bombed the base had practiced for years with F-100s at this very same air base when it was Wheelus Air Base and later at Zaragoza AB Spain with F-4D Phantoms and F-111s for just such a mission. The fourteen-hour round trip to Libya required repeated in-air refueling (over seven million pounds of fuel), because countries closer to Libya - Spain, Italy, France, and Greece - had refused American planes permission to fly over or from bases in their countries. = Post‚ÄìCold War = Okba Ben Nafi AB was converted for civilian use and became Mitiga Airport in 1995. The airport also housed the headquarters of Buraq Air.\\"Company Profile.\\" Buraq Air. Retrieved 14 May 2010. \\"The company headquarters are located at Mittiga International Airport in Tripoli - Libya.\\" =2011 Libyan civil war= During the 2011 Libyan civil war, the Times of Malta and The Guardian reported claims that the airport had been taken over by protesters opposed to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. On 13 March 2011, Ali Atiyya, a colonel of the Libyan Air Force at the airport, defected and joined the anti-Gaddafi forces. On 21 August 2011, rebels launched an assault on Mitiga as part of a bid to battle loyalist forces in Tripoli, sustaining a number of casualties in the process. On 25 October 2011 Google Earth released multispectral imagery from GeoEye taken on 28 August 2011 which showed the airfield as well as the highly capable MiG-25 aircraft with no visible damage. This imagery confirmation helped validate the reporting which suggested the airfield had been taken over early on by opposition protesters as NATO and US air forces would want to avoid collateral damage to the opposition movement. = 2014 Libyan civil war = During the 2019‚Äì20 Western Libya campaign, the airport, held by military units loyal to the Government of National Accord, was repeatedly targeted with airstrikes from the opposing Libyan National Army in order to enforce a no-fly zone declared by the LNA several days prior. On April 8, 2019, an airport spokesman announced that the airport was forced to close due to airstrikes.

It is named after the German scientist Alexander von Humboldt who visited the island in 1800 and 1801. The park was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2001 for of its size, altitude range, complex lithology, landform diversity, and wealth of endemic flora and fauna. Overview The rivers that flow off the peaks of the park are some of the largest in the insular Caribbean. The park is said to be the most humid place in Cuba and this causes a high biological diversity. The park has an area of , of which land area and marine area. Elevation ranges from sea level to on El Toldo Peak. 16 of Cuba's 28 endemic plant species are protected in the park including such flora as Dracaena cubensis and Podocarpus ekman. Fauna present in the park includes various species of parrots, lizards, hummingbirds, the endangered Cuban solenodon (endemic), hutia and snails. History The Alexander von Humboldt National Park has historically been an area of land little used by man, with only one archaeological site from the pre-Columbian period being known; this is located in the coastal zone of Aguas Verdes. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries some peripheral places were used as refuges or camps by maroons. The park began to be laid out in the 1960s, with the declaration of the Jaguani and Cupeyal del Norte nature reserves. This continued into the 1980s with the proposal of the Ojito del Agua Refuge, associated with the last sighting of the royal woodpecker, a last remnant of this species which was already extinct in its other habitats in the United States and Mexico. In 1996 these protected areas were united to form a national park that was named after Alexander von Humboldt. Being one of the most important biosphere reserves in the Caribbean basin, the national park, along with Cuchillas del Toa was declared a UNESCO World Natural Heritage Site in 2001. There are unique flora and fauna elements in this unique ecosystem, with some of the highest indexes of endemicity in the archipelago.

He was the eldest son of 'Adud al-Dawla.  Early life  When Kerman was conquered by his father in 968, Shirdil was appointed as viceroy to that province. For some time after 977 he resided in Baghdad, but was then sent back to Kerman. As the eldest son, Shirdil regarded himself as the successor to his father; 'Adud al-Dawla's apparent preference for his second son Marzuban therefore made him hostile toward his brother. 'Adud al-Dawla never definitively named a successor by the time of his death in 983. Marzuban (now Samsam al-Dawla) took power in Baghdad as senior amir, but Shirdil also laid his claims to the succession, and from Kerman he invaded and captured Fars.  Reign  Shirdil, who now used the title \\"Sharaf al-Dawla\\" (), soon found his position surrounded by enemies. In the west, Samsam al-Dawla ruled in Baghdad, while two more of his brothers, Taj al-Dawla and Diya' al-Dawla, were in control of Basra and Khuzestan. To the north, Fakhr al-Dawla ruled in Ray. The next few years were spent by Sharaf al-Dawla fighting against all of these individuals. He provided support to the Samanids when Fakhr al-Dawla attempted to wrest Khorasan from them. Despite this, the rulers of Basra and Khuzestan soon acknowledged Fakhr al-Dawla as senior amir, making the latter the most powerful of the Buyids. Despite this turn of events, Sharaf al-Dawla was able to expand his position. He recovered Buyid Oman, which had earlier seceded to Samsam al-Dawla. In early 986 he captured Basra and Khuzestan, forcing the two brothers to flee to Fakhr al-Dawla's territory. He then took on Samsam al- Dawla; by May or June 986 the latter recognized Sharaf al-Dawla as senior amir. Sharaf al-Dawla probably intended to invade Fakhr al-Dawla's realm, but Iraq soon slipped into anarchy and he was forced to intervene there. He entered Baghdad in 987, deposed Samsam al-Dawla and imprisoned him along with his official Fuladh ibn Manadhar in Fars. He also had the Daylamite officer Ziyar ibn Shahrakawayh executed. In July of that year the caliph proclaimed him as senior amir. Sharaf al-Dawla's next planned to subdue the Kurd Badr ibn Hasanwayh, who had taken over Diyarbakr during Samsam al-Dawla's reign and was an ally of Fakhr al-Dawla. The campaign failed, and not long afterwards Sharaf al-Dawla died, either in 988 or 989. He had managed to mostly preserve 'Adud al-Dawla's empire, but the Buyids of Ray under Fakhr al-Dawla had become effectively independent. He was succeeded by his brother Baha' al-Dawla, but Samsam al-Dawla escaped from prison and captured Fars, Kerman and Khuzestan.

Underground soft rock mining is a group of underground mining techniques used to extract coal, oil shale, potash and other minerals or geological materials from sedimentary (\\"soft\\") rocks. Because deposits in sedimentary rocks are commonly layered and relatively less hard, the mining methods used differ from those used to mine deposits in igneous or metamorphic rocks (see Underground mining (hard rock)). Underground mining techniques also differ greatly from those of surface mining. Methods of underground soft rock mining * Longwall mining ‚Äì A set of longwall mining equipment consists of a coal shearer mounted on conveyor operating underneath a series of self-advancing hydraulic roof supports. Almost the entire process can be automated. Longwall mining machines are typically 150‚Äì250 metres in width and 1.5 to 3 metres high. Longwall miners extract \\"panels\\" - rectangular blocks of coal as wide as the face the equipment is installed in, and as long as several kilometres. Powerful mechanical coal cutters (shearers) cut coal from the face, which falls onto an armoured face conveyor for removal. Longwalls can advance into an area of coal, or more commonly, retreat back between development tunnels (called \\"gateroads\\") As a longwall miner retreats back along a panel, the roof behind the supports is allowed to collapse in a planned and controlled manner. * Room-and-pillar mining or continuous mining ‚Äì Room and pillar mining is commonly done in flat or gently dipping bedded ores. Pillars are left in place in a regular pattern while the rooms are mined out. In many room and pillar mines, the pillars are taken out, starting at the farthest point from the mine haulage exit, retreating, and letting the roof come down upon the floor. Room and pillar methods are well adapted to mechanization, and are used in deposits such as coal, potash, phosphate, salt, oil shale, and bedded uranium ores. * Blast mining ‚Äì An older practice of coal mining that uses explosives such as dynamite to break up the coal seam, after which the coal is gathered and loaded onto shuttle cars or conveyors for removal to a central loading area. This process consists of a series of operations that begins with \\"cutting\\" the coalbed so it will break easily when blasted with explosives.

He is best remembered for his acrimonious and damaging involvement with the slightly younger artist Caravaggio and his important collection of biographies of the other artists working in Rome in his lifetime, although there are many works of his in Roman churches and galleries and elsewhere. Life He was born and died in Rome, but from his own account came from a noble family of Perugia. A pupil of the obscure Florentine artist working in Rome, Francesco Morelli (not to be confused with the later French-Italian engraver Francesco Morelli), he worked mainly in Rome, initially with a late-Mannerist style influenced by Giuseppe Cesari (or the \\"Cavaliere d'Arpino\\"). After an intermezzo Caravaggesco when he was heavily influenced by the young Caravaggio in the early years of the new century, and a Bolognese-influenced phase in the 1610s, Baglione's final style became more generalized and typical of Roman Early Baroque painters such as Guercino, though always reflecting his training in the Central Italian tradition of disegno, the absence of which he criticized in the Caravaggisti. To Rudolf Wittkower, his style \\"vacillated between progressive trends, without absorbing them fully\\".O'Neill; Wittkower, who relegates his account of Baglione's style to a note at n. 9, p. 514, and p. 74 He spent 1621‚Äì1622 in Mantua as the court artist of Duke Ferdinando Gonzaga, where the exposure to the fabulous Gonzaga collection of Venetian paintings influenced his style.O'Neill Otherwise he remained in Rome, where he was long successful in attracting commissions from the Papal court and aristocracy. His paintings have been described by the art historian Steven F. Ostrow as \\"extraordinarily uneven, at best, competent, and his work pales in comparison with that of many of the contemporary artists he emulated\\", while his \\"chalk and pen and ink drawings reveal a force and lyricism rarely found in his paintings\\".Ostrow, 609 The quality of his work declined sharply in the 1630s, by which time he was in his late sixties.Wittkower, citing Carla Guigliemi (1954), n. 9, p. 514 He had a successful career, receiving a Papal knighthood in the Supreme Order of Christ (the highest of the Papal orders) in 1606, and his long involvement with Rome's Accademia di San Luca and his biographies reveal \\"an artist obsessed with status\\". He was a member of the Accademia from 1593 until his death, and three times President.Ostrow, 609, Dictionary Apart from the regular later title of \\"first historian of the Roman Baroque\\", in his lifetime he was also nicknamed Il Sordo del Barozzo as he suffered from deafness. He died in Rome on 30 December 1643 at the age of 77.Dictionary Writings Giovanni Baglione, Sacred Love and Profane Love (c. 1602‚Äì03), Oil on canvas, Gem√§ldegalerie, Berlin Giovanni Baglione, Sacred Love and Profane Love, 1602. Oil on canvas, 240 √ó 143 cm. Rome, Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica di Palazzo Barberini. He published two books, The nine churches of Rome (Le nove chiese di Roma 1639), and The Lives of Painters, Sculptors, Architects and Engravers, active from 1572‚Äì1642 (Le Vite de' Pittori, scultori, architetti, ed Intagliatori dal Pontificato di Gregorio XII del 1572. fino a' tempi de Papa Urbano VIII. nel 1642, 1642). The latter is still seen as an important historical source for artists living in Rome during the lifetime of Baglione. His first book was an artistic guide to Rome's nine major pilgrimage churches, which is notable for its period in taking an interest in the works of all periods, and remains useful to scholars as an account of these churches at a point before many subsequent alterations. It \\"marks a watershed in the guidebook literature of Rome-the turning point between the older tradition of devotional guidebooks ... and the modern tradition of artistic guides\\".Ostrow, 609, quoted; Dictionary His biographies cover over two hundred artists in various media, all of whom had worked in Rome and were dead by the time he published. Relatively few other sources, other than contracts and the like, exist for most of these figures, and Baglione's work often remains the basis for their biographies, being drawn on extensively by Bellori, Passeri and others, as well as modern writers.Ostrow, 609; Dictionary Baglione had known a large number of his subjects personally and his attributions and basic factual information is considered generally reliable, although like Vasari and most intervening biographers of artists, he sometimes repeats anecdotes uncritically. He carefully notes information about the social status and progress of his subjects, and is often very quick to criticise and moralize over human failings and bad habits. He \\"recorded all signs of social status, including houses, dress, collections, permission to wear a sword, splendid funerals, and tombs.\\" Similarly, he never failed to mention if an artist was a member of his beloved Academy of St. Luke, had been elected to the Virtuosi del Pantheon, had been knighted, had been well paid for his work, or had been employed by noble patrons. And the corollary to this is Baglione's delight in recognizing artists as virtuosi, not simply as an expression of their artistic ability but in reference to their possessing literary, musical, or dramaturgical skills. Running throughout Le vite, in other words, is an abiding concern with the honor of the profession-with the elevated status and nobilta of the artist as gentleman.\\"Ostrow, 609, quoting Joseph Connor at the start. As far as possible, his descriptions of works concentrated on those accessible to the public.O'Neil Litigation against Caravaggio Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, Amor Vincit Omnia, c. 1602. Oil on canvas, 156.5 √ó 113.3 cm. Gem√§ldegalerie, Berlin. Baglione's best known painting, Sacred Love and Profane Love (or The Divine Eros Defeats the Earthly Eros and other variants), was a direct response to Caravaggio's Amor Vincit Omnia (1601‚Äì02). Baglione's painting exists in two versions, the earlier in the Gem√§ldegalerie, Berlin (c. 1602‚Äì03) and the later in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica at Palazzo Barberini in Rome. Both show Sacred Love as an angelic winged figure interrupting a 'meeting' between Cupid (Profane Love), shown as in the Caravaggio as a smaller and naked winged figure, and the Devil. In the later Rome version the devil is portrayed with the caricatured features of Caravaggio, while in Berlin his face is turned away. Both paintings were commissioned by members of the Giustiniani family in Rome: the Caravaggio by the banker and collector Marchese Vincenzo Giustiniani, and Baglione's riposte by his brother Cardinal Benedetto Giustiniani. What in the two brothers was probably a good-natured family joke reflected serious rivalry between the artists concerned. Baglione was greatly influenced by the style of Caravaggio during this period of his career, and the younger artist and his circle had claimed, with some justification, that Baglione had plagiarized his style.Ostrow, 608; Gem√§ldegalerie, Berlin, Prestel, 148; Wittkower, 74 In late August 1603 Baglione filed a suit for libel against Caravaggio, Orazio Gentileschi, Ottavio Leoni, and Filipo Trisegni in connection with some unflattering poems circulated around Rome over the preceding summer, which he appears to have been correct in attributing to Caravaggio's circle. Baglione had recently completed his large altarpiece of the Resurrection of Jesus for Il Gesu, the main church of the Jesuit Order (it was much later replaced), and claimed that Caravaggio was jealous of this important commission. Caravaggio's testimony during the trial as recorded in court documents is one of the few documented records of his thoughts about art and his contemporaries. It included statements that: \\"I don't know any painter who thinks Giovanni Baglione is a good painter\\", the Resurrection altarpiece was \\"clumsy [goffa]\\" and \\"it's the worst he's done, and I haven't heard a single painter praise the said painting.\\" Caravaggio was found guilty and held in the Tor di Nona prison for two weeks after the trial, but far from clearing his reputation, Caravaggio's damaging remarks have dominated the critical assessment of Baglione ever since, although Gentileschi's evidence conceded that he was a \\"first-class painter\\". Years after Caravaggio's early death in 1610, Baglione was his first biographer, and though he gave him much praise for his early works, his dislike is evident, concentrated on the younger artist's life and character and his later paintings; this verdict, especially as regards the man, has also remained highly influential.Ostrow, 608 (with Caravaggio quotes); Dictionary (quotes Gentileschi) Paintings He was mainly a painter of religious subjects, reflecting the Roman market, but also painted several mythological subjects, including an \\"astonishing\\" Venus whipped by Love (1620s) with an unusually suggestive pose, accentuated by strong chiaroscuro, for the plump goddess, who is viewed foreshortened from behind as she lies on a bed.Ostrow, 608, quoted; image He was employed in many of the considerable numbers of church commissions in Rome during the pontificates of Clement VIII, Paul V and Urban VIII in the early years of the new century, from which the Caravaggisti were largely excluded.Wittkower, 28, 33, 141 The two largest churches being filled with paintings at this period were St. Peter's Basilica, where his Saint Peter Raising Tabitha from the Dead (1607) earned his knighthood from Paul V, and Santa Maria Maggiore, where his frescoes can be seen in the Cappella Borghese. For the church of Santa Maria dell'Orto he painted a number of works in both fresco and oils, including a fresco cycle of scenes from the Life of the Virgin, a Saint Sebastian and other saints. A Last Supper is in San Nicola in Carcere. There is a Saint Stephen in the Cathedral at Perugia, and in that of Loreto a Saint Catherine. The Giustizia (Justice) hall at the Rocca dei Rossi was completely frescoed by Baglione.

Chepstow station is on the Gloucester to Newport Line. It is from the town centre, at Station Road. Chepstow is a historic walled border town and ancient port, situated at the southern end of the Wye Valley, two hours from London. The line continues east from the station to Gloucester over the Chepstow railway bridge. It was formerly the junction station for the Wye Valley Railway to Monmouth Troy station until this line closed to passengers in 1959. The railway now consists of a double track line with a trailing crossover to the east of the station, plus some disused track in the former yard. Description The cast-iron footbridge (2017) The single-storey buildings on the Gloucester/Birmingham side of the line are stone and timber-built structures, in an Italianate style. They were completed in 1850 for Isambard Kingdom Brunel's South Wales Railway, and according to architectural historian John Newman were designed by N. Lancaster Owen.John Newman, The Buildings of Wales: Gwent/Monmouthshire, Penguin Books, 2000, , p.184 A canopy provides shelter. On the more popular Newport/Cardiff side, there is just a small modern shelter. Access to this platform is via a cast-iron footbridge, making it difficult for passengers with pushchairs and the old and the infirm to cross. The footbridge is a now- rare survival of a typical GWR iron pattern, still with its wooden cladding and canopy, and is Grade II listed. It was cast in Edward Finch's ironworks, adjoining the station. Other Grade II listings at the station include the two bridges: the surviving piers and abutment of the Chepstow Railway Bridge, and the bridge providing access to the steam mill and ironworks site.

Like other species in the genus Enterococcus, E. faecalis is found in healthy humans, but can cause life-threatening infections, especially in the nosocomial (hospital) environment, where the naturally high levels of antibiotic resistance found in E. faecalis contribute to its pathogenicity. E. faecalis has been frequently found in reinfected, root canal-treated teeth in prevalence values ranging from 30% to 90% of the cases. Re-infected root canal-treated teeth are about nine times more likely to harbor E. faecalis than cases of primary infections.  Physiology  E. faecalis is a nonmotile microbe; it ferments glucose without gas production, and does not produce a catalase reaction with hydrogen peroxide. It produces a reduction of litmus milk, but does not liquefy gelatin. It shows consistent growth throughout nutrient broth which is consistent with being a facultative anaerobe. It catabolizes a variety of energy sources, including glycerol, lactate, malate, citrate, arginine, agmatine, and many keto acids. Enterococci survive very harsh environments, including extremely alkaline pH (9.6) and salt concentrations. They resist bile salts, detergents, heavy metals, ethanol, azide, and desiccation. They can grow in the range of 10 to 45 ¬∞C and survive at temperatures of 60 ¬∞C for 30 min.  Pathogenesis  E. faecalis is found in most healthy individuals, but can cause endocarditis and sepsis, urinary tract infections (UTIs), meningitis, and other infections in humans. Several virulence factors are thought to contribute to E. faecalis infections. A plasmid-encoded hemolysin, called the cytolysin, is important for pathogenesis in animal models of infection, and the cytolysin in combination with high-level gentamicin resistance is associated with a five-fold increase in risk of death in human bacteremia patients. A plasmid-encoded adhesin called \\"aggregation substance\\" is also important for virulence in animal models of infection. This is a Gram stain for Enterococcus faecalis under 1000 magnification (bright field microscopy)  Antibacterial resistance  Multi drug resistance = E. faecalis is resistant to many commonly used antimicrobial agents (aminoglycosides, aztreonam, cephalosporins (see below), clindamycin, the semisynthetic penicillins nafcillin and oxacillin, and trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole). Resistance to vancomycin in E. faecalis is becoming more common. Treatment options for vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis include nitrofurantoin (in the case of uncomplicated UTIs), linezolid, and daptomycin, although ampicillin is preferred if the bacteria are susceptible. Quinupristin/dalfopristin can be used to treat Enterococcus faecium but not E. faecalis. In root-canal treatments, NaOCl and chlorhexidine (CHX) are used to fight E. faecalis before isolating the canal. However, recent studies determined that NaOCl or CHX showed low ability to eliminate E. faecalis. = Development of antibiotic resistance  Combined drug therapies = According to one study combined drug therapy has shown some efficacy in cases of severe infections (e.g. heart valves infections) against susceptible strains of E. faecalis. Ampicillin- and vancomycin-sensitive E. faecalis (lacking high-level resistance to aminoglycosides) strains can be treated by gentamicin and ampicillin antibiotics. A less nephrotoxic combination of ampicillin and ceftriaxone (even though E. faecalis is resistant to cephalosporins, ceftriaxone is working synergistically with ampicillin) may be used alternatively for ampicillin-susceptible E. faecalis. Daptomycin or linezolid may also show efficacy in case ampicillin and vancomycin resistance. A combination of penicillin and streptomycin therapy was used in the past.

In 2013, a combination of cold denaturation and NMR spectroscopy was used to show detailed insights into the unfolding of the E. faecalis homodimeric repressor protein CylR2. Genome structure The E. faecalis genome consists of 3.22 million base pairs with 3,113 protein-coding genes.  Small RNA  Bacterial small RNAs play important roles in many cellular processes; 11 small RNAs have been experimentally characterised in E. faecalis V583 and detected in various growth phases. Five of them have been shown to be involved in stress response and virulence. A genome-wide sRNA study suggested that some sRNAs are linked to the antibiotic resistance and stress response in another Enteroccocus: E. faecium.

Personal life John Maddox Roberts was born in Ohio and was raised in Texas, California, New Mexico. He has lived in various places in the United States as well as in Scotland, England and Mexico. He was kicked out of college in 1967 and joined the Army. He was in the US Army 1967‚Äì70, and did a tour in Vietnam. After he returned, he became a Green Beret. He lives with his wife in Estancia, New Mexico. retrieved August 31, 2010 Career Upon his return to civilian life, Roberts decided to be a writer and sold his first book to Doubleday in 1975; his book was published in 1977 as The Strayed Sheep of Charum. His earlier books were in the science fiction, fantasy and historical genres. In 1989, Roberts published his first historical mystery, The King's Gambit, set in ancient Rome. The book was nominated for the Edgar Award as best mystery of the year. The book was first in Maddox's SPQR series of mysteries. Roberts also wrote a series of contemporary detective novels about a private eye named Gabe Treloar. The first book, A Typical American Town, is set in a fictionalized version of that Ohio town where he was born. The second, The Ghosts of Saigon, used his experiences in Vietnam. The third, Desperate Highways, is a road novel. When asked by TSR to do a Dragonlance mystery, he wrote Murder in Tarsis. Roberts wrote an unpublished science fiction book called The Line, a police procedural set in a near-future Los Angeles where the biggest racket is illegal traffic in fetal pineal glands.

Unstructured information is typically text-heavy, but may contain data such as dates, numbers, and facts as well. This results in irregularities and ambiguities that make it difficult to understand using traditional programs as compared to data stored in fielded form in databases or annotated (semantically tagged) in documents. In 1998, Merrill Lynch said \\"unstructured data comprises the vast majority of data found in an organization, some estimates run as high as 80%.\\" It's unclear what the source of this number is, but nonetheless it is accepted by some. Other sources have reported similar or higher percentages of unstructured data. , IDC and Dell EMC project that data will grow to 40 zettabytes by 2020, resulting in a 50-fold growth from the beginning of 2010. More recently, IDC and Seagate predict that the global datasphere will grow to 163 zettabytes by 2025 and majority of that will be unstructured. The Computer World magazine states that unstructured information might account for more than 70%‚Äì80% of all data in organizations.  Background  The earliest research into business intelligence focused in on unstructured textual data, rather than numerical data. As early as 1958, computer science researchers like H.P. Luhn were particularly concerned with the extraction and classification of unstructured text. However, only since the turn of the century has the technology caught up with the research interest. In 2004, the SAS Institute developed the SAS Text Miner, which uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce a hyper-dimensional textual space into smaller dimensions for significantly more efficient machine-analysis. The mathematical and technological advances sparked by machine textual analysis prompted a number of businesses to research applications, leading to the development of fields like sentiment analysis, voice of the customer mining, and call center optimization. The emergence of Big Data in the late 2000s led to a heightened interest in the applications of unstructured data analytics in contemporary fields such as predictive analytics and root cause analysis.  Issues with terminology  The term is imprecise for several reasons: # Structure, while not formally defined, can still be implied. # Data with some form of structure may still be characterized as unstructured if its structure is not helpful for the processing task at hand. # Unstructured information might have some structure (semi-structured) or even be highly structured but in ways that are unanticipated or unannounced.  Dealing with unstructured data  Techniques such as data mining, natural language processing (NLP), and text analytics provide different methods to find patterns in, or otherwise interpret, this information. Common techniques for structuring text usually involve manual tagging with metadata or part-of-speech tagging for further text mining-based structuring. The Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) standard provided a common framework for processing this information to extract meaning and create structured data about the information. Software that creates machine-processable structure can utilize the linguistic, auditory, and visual structure that exist in all forms of human communication. Algorithms can infer this inherent structure from text, for instance, by examining word morphology, sentence syntax, and other small- and large-scale patterns. Unstructured information can then be enriched and tagged to address ambiguities and relevancy-based techniques then used to facilitate search and discovery. Examples of \\"unstructured data\\" may include books, journals, documents, metadata, health records, audio, video, analog data, images, files, and unstructured text such as the body of an e-mail message, Web page, or word-processor document. While the main content being conveyed does not have a defined structure, it generally comes packaged in objects (e.g. in files or documents, ‚Ä¶) that themselves have structure and are thus a mix of structured and unstructured data, but collectively this is still referred to as \\"unstructured data\\". For example, an HTML web page is tagged, but HTML mark-up typically serves solely for rendering. It does not capture the meaning or function of tagged elements in ways that support automated processing of the information content of the page. XHTML tagging does allow machine processing of elements, although it typically does not capture or convey the semantic meaning of tagged terms. Since unstructured data commonly occurs in electronic documents, the use of a content or document management system which can categorize entire documents is often preferred over data transfer and manipulation from within the documents. Document management thus provides the means to convey structure onto document collections. Search engines have become popular tools for indexing and searching through such data, especially text. = Approaches in natural language processing = Specific computational workflows have been developed to impose structure upon the unstructured data contained within text documents. These workflows are generally designed to handle sets of thousands or even millions of documents, or far more than manual approaches to annotation may permit. Several of these approaches are based upon the concept of online analytical processing, or OLAP, and may be supported by data models such as text cubes. Once document metadata is available through a data model, generating summaries of subsets of documents (i.e., cells within a text cube) may be performed with phrase-based approaches. = Approaches in medicine and biomedical research = Biomedical research generates one major source of unstructured data as researchers often publish their findings in scholarly journals. Though the language in these documents is challenging to derive structural elements from (e.g., due to the complicated technical vocabulary contained within and the domain knowledge required to fully contextualize observations), the results of these activities may yield links between technical and medical studies and clues regarding new disease therapies. Recent efforts to enforce structure upon biomedical documents include self-organizing map approaches for identifying topics among documents, general-purpose unsupervised algorithms, and an application of the CaseOLAP workflow to determine associations between protein names and cardiovascular disease topics in the literature. CaseOLAP defines phrase- category relationships in an accurate (identifies relationships), consistent (highly reproducible), and efficient manner. This platform offers enhanced accessibility and empowers the biomedical community with phrase-mining tools for widespread biomedical research applications.

Secretions from sebaceous glands and sweat glands also benefit this protective barrier. In the event of an injury that damages the skin's protective barrier, the body triggers a response called wound healing. After hemostasis, inflammation white blood cells, including phagocytic macrophages arrive at the injury site. Once the invading microorganisms have been brought under control, the skin proceeds to heal itself. The ability of the skin to heal even after considerable damage has occurred is due to the presence of stem cells in the dermis and cells in the stratum basale of the epidermis, all of which can generate new tissue. When an injury extends through the epidermis into the dermis, bleeding occurs and the inflammatory response begins. Clotting mechanisms in the blood are soon activated, and a clot of scab is formed within several hours. The scab temporarily restores the integrity of the epidermis and restricts the entry of microorganisms. After the scab is formed, cells of the stratum basale begin to divide by mitosis and migrate to the edges of the scab. A week after the injury, the edges of the wound are pulled together by contraction. Contraction is an important part of the healing process when damage has been extensive, and involves shrinking in size of underlying contractile connective tissue, which brings the wound margins toward one another.Martin, P. Wound Healing-aiming for perfect skin regeneration. Science (1997), 276, 75-81 In a major injury, if epithelial cell migration and tissue contraction cannot cover the wound, suturing the edges of the injured skin together, or even replacement of lost skin with skin grafts, may be required to restore the skin. As epithelial cells continue to migrate around the scab, the dermis is repaired by the activity of stem cells. These active cells produce collagenous fibers and ground substance. Blood vessels soon grow into the dermis, restoring circulation. If the injury is very minor, the epithelial cells eventually restore the epidermis once the dermis has been regenerated. In major injuries, the repair mechanisms are unable to restore the skin to its original condition. The repaired region contains an abnormally large number of collagenous fibers, and relatively few blood vessels. Damaged sweat and sebaceous glands, hair follicles, muscle cells, and nerves are seldom repaired. They are usually replaced by the fibrous tissue. The result is the formation of an inflexible, fibrous scar tissue.

The band is often compared to the Beatles as regards the time period of its activity, its artistic and cultural influence and continuing popularity. Name The band's name was originally taken from the family name of Lajos Ill√©s, one of the members. Later however, the band chose as its logo a chariot in the form of musical notes, drawn by two horses, riding over the name \\"Ill√©s\\" and the sun. This logo deliberately references the chariot of the prophet Elijah (Ill√©s in Hungarian) in the Old Testament, in which he was said to have been taken to Heaven.

This was the time the Hungarian language programs of Radio Luxemburg, broadcast illegally to Hungary, started to influence Hungarian youth culture. They were the first wildly popular band of the \\"new\\" beat music. Their song M√©g f√°j minden cs√≥k (Every kiss still hurts) caused quite a scandal in 1966 because of Levente Sz√∂r√©nyi's \\"squeaking\\" singing style. Despite them being highly controversial, they were supported by the Communist regime - that was trying at the time to introduce a policy of \\"small liberties\\" for the people - and received numerous awards. Nevertheless, they did not publish an album until 1967, with the film soundtrack for Ezek a fiatalok (\\"These young people!\\" or \\"These are the young people\\"). The movie was an attempt to make the general audience better acquainted with the (comparatively tame) youth culture of the time. Some of the most popular bands and singers of the time appear in the film, including Ill√©s and Omega while the main female role is played by another famous Hungarian pop singer, Zsuzsa Koncz. By the late 1960s, a great number of beat bands had emerged in Hungary. Fans of Ill√©s and Omega soon started rivalries, parallelling the Beatles- Rolling Stones rivalry in the West. After Ill√©s The band broke up in 1973, possibly also due to political pressure. The Ill√©s had been in fact barred for one year (plus a fine) from the Capital because of an interview they did release while staying in Britain and where they did criticize government. Nevertheless, the members, especially L. Sz√∂r√©nyi and Br√≥dy, continued to work together on other projects, notably with their new band Fonogr√°f along with Sz. Sz√∂r√©nyi, which tried to blend country elements with Hungarian folk music with hits like L√∂kd ide a s√∂rt! (Pass the beer!) and Mondd, hogy nem haragszol r√°m! (Say that you are not angry). They also continued their cooperation with singer Zsuzsa Koncz, for whom they had written songs since the first half of the 1960s. The band later re-united for high-profile concerts on different occasions, the most memorable probably being their 1990 performance in the N√©pstadion after the regime change in Hungary. In 2001 they also performed a common concert with the other two dominant Hungarian bands of their era, Omega and Metr√≥. In 1983, Sz√∂r√©nyi and Br√≥dy wrote the rock opera Istv√°n, a kir√°ly, based on the life of Saint Stephen I, the first king of Hungary. It became an instant smash hit and retains a cult following to this day. After the fall of Communism in 1990, Sz√∂r√©nyi and Br√≥dy grew apart politically. Br√≥dy, a secular Jew, sympathized with the liberal Free Democrats, while Sz√∂r√©nyi became increasingly nationalist and a religious Christian. This was reflected in his later rock operas like Atilla, Isten kardja (Atilla, the Sword of God - 1994) and Veled, Uram! (With You, My Lord! - 2000). The latter is a sequel to Istv√°n, a kir√°ly. Drummer Zolt√°n P√°sztory left Hungary in the 1970s and went to West Germany, where he sank into obscurity. He died in 2005 at the age of 60. For the already booked two concerts of the band in 2005 (one on the first day of the annual Sziget fesztiv√°l in Budapest and the other in Miercurea Ciuc) his place at the drums was taken over by √ñrs Sz√∂r√©nyi, the son of the band's lead guitarist Levente Sz√∂r√©nyi. After the original Ill√©s formation broke up, founder and keyboardist Lajos Ill√©s kept operating a band with the same name until the early 1980s. He later retired to the small village of Kisoroszi, where he acted as the chorister of the local Reformed church (his wife being the pastor there), and continued composing music including chorals, musicals and film soundtracks. He died in 2007 at the age of 64. Albums Zolt√°n P√°sztory, J√°nos Br√≥dy - Levente Sz√∂r√©nyi, Lajos Ill√©s, Szabolcs Sz√∂r√©nyi.

It continues to hold an annual exhibition of paintings and drawings at the Mall Galleries in London, exhibiting works by both members and artists from Britain and abroad whose work has been selected from an annual open submission. History Young English artists returning from studying art in Paris mounted the first exhibition of the New English Art Club in April 1886. Among them were William Laidlay, Thomas Cooper Gotch, Frank Bramley, John Singer Sargent, Philip Wilson Steer, George Clausen and Stanhope Forbes. Another founding member was G. P. Jacomb-Hood. An early name suggested for the group was the 'Society of Anglo-French Painters', which gives some indication of their origins. As a note in the catalogue to their first exhibition explained, 'This Club consists of 50 Members, who are more or less united in their art sympathies. They have associated themselves together with the view of holding an Annual Exhibition, hoping that a collective display of their works, which has hitherto been impossible, will prove not only of interest to the public, but will better explain the aim and method of their art.'Kenneth McConkey, The New English: A History of the New English Art Club (Royal Academy of Arts, London, 2006), pp. 29-30 The Society held regular Spring and Autumn exhibitions, a number of which were held at the Egyptian Hall in Piccadilly, London, until its demolition in 1905. The Impressionist style was well represented at the NEAC, in comparison to the old-school academic art shown at the Royal Academy. For a time, the NEAC was seen as a stepping-stone to Royal Academy membership. Today the NEAC continues in a realistic, figurative style, while the Royal Academy has embraced abstract and conceptual art. Current NEAC members include Peter Brown, Frederick Cuming, Anthony Green, Ken Howard, Charles Williams, Richard Bawden and Martin Yeoman.

She is played by actress Nicki Clyne. Cally works as an air maintenance Specialist on Galactica's flight deck and is married to her boss, CPO Galen Tyrol.  Character biography  Cally joined the Colonial Forces to help pay for schooling as a dentist and was about to be honorably discharged following Galactica's decommissioning. The destruction of the Twelve Colonies changes these plans, leaving her little choice but to stay on board as a member of the crew. As with many secondary characters in the series, it was never definitively stated which of the Twelve Colonies that Cally was from; however, there are several clues. In the episode \\"Dirty Hands\\" she criticizes the social position of the enlisted crewmen like her and her husband by pointing out that most Colonial Fleet officers are from the wealthy colonies like Caprica, Tauron, and Virgon - as opposed to from the poorest colonies, which she lists as Sagittaron, Gemenon, and Aerilon. This indicates that she was from one of these poorer colonies and not one of the wealthier ones. However, she does not appear to be from the poorest and most downtrodden colony, Sagittaron, because at various points when the Sagittarons are discussed she refers to them as a separate group. It's not clear if this means she was from Gemenon or Aerilon, or one of the other six \\"not wealthy\\" colonies, though her husband was a Gemenon. Prior to the attack, and immediately following it, she works as a Specialist in the air maintenance crew of Battlestar Galactica. The crew is led by Chief Galen Tyrol, on whom she has a secret crush despite his relationship with Sharon \\"Boomer\\" Valerii. While on the Chief's crew, she is responsible for the maintenance of Vipers and Raptors, and sometimes Galactica herself. Cally gets her first experience with the hazards of field operations when she is assigned to a team sent to the prison ship Astral Queen to enlist volunteers from the inmates for water recovery from an icy moon. While the team is there, the prisoners stage an uprising and Cally becomes one of several hostages. She is shot by one of the prisoners when she fights off his attempted rape by biting off his ear. She recovers from her injuries and returns to work. Some time later, she is assigned to the Kobol landing party as part of a technical crew, along with Chief Tyrol, Vice President Gaius Baltar, Lt. Crashdown and a number of others. They are ambushed by Cylon forces on the surface and their Raptor crashes. On the run, with casualties mounting and the situation rapidly deteriorating, she is given a suicidal attack order by an increasingly unhinged Crashdown, her commanding officer at the time. Seeing that she is too scared to carry out the order, Crashdown threatens to execute her, only to be shot and killed himself by Dr. Baltar. Following their rescue from Kobol, she returns to regular duty, but soon after murders Sharon \\"Boomer\\" Valerii, who had been discovered to be a Cylon sleeper agent. Enraged by Boomer's assassination attempt on Commander Adama, and the difficulties she created for the Chief, Cally shoots and kills the Cylon before any trial can start. Although the crime is clearly murder, Adama is lenient after hearing Chief Tyrol pleas, and she serves only 30 days for the minor offense of \\"unauthorized discharge of a firearm.\\" Following her release, she is treated to a party by her comrades. Cally's relationship with Chief Tyrol becomes romantic under unusual circumstances. Finding him sleeping on the flight deck one night, Cally rouses the Chief from a violent dream and in his delirium he beats her severely before he becomes cognizant. Remorseful, he visits her in the hospital, where he mumbles what he did to her was \\"unforgivable.\\" Through her wired-closed broken jaw she tells him she forgives him and, in a deleted scene, admits her love for him. Though surprised by the admission at first, the Chief eventually returns her love. However, prior to this, Cally has a relationship with Brendan Costanza and becomes pregnant with his child. Some weeks later, the Chief stuns her with a marriage proposal. By the time of their demobilization and settlement on New Caprica, Cally has married Galen Tyrol and taken his last name. Some time following the Cylon occupation of the colony she gives birth to her son with Costanza, Nicholas Stephen, telling the Chief the child is his. Galen Tyrol is a major player in the resistance movement on New Caprica and Cally supports him. As a result, she is one of the citizens who are rounded up during a major sweep by the New Caprica Police. She is visited in prison in good faith by the resurrected Sharon \\"Boomer\\" Valerii, the same one that she had killed over a year ago, but she rejects her offer of help. Selected to be executed along with several other prisoners, Cally is freed by the policeman Jammer, one of her friends from the Galactica deck gang who had tried to get her freed without success, and is reunited with her husband and child. Following the evacuation, Cally and Galen re-settled aboard Galactica, at first in converted refugee barracks, then eventually in quarters. Reinstated in their old positions, they take turns watching over their son while carrying out their duties on the flight deck, a punishing schedule that begins to take its toll. Although they work well as a team during the exploration and subsequent escape from the Algae Planet, by this time Cally and Galen's marriage is starting to become strained. An accident on the job brings them back together. Bickering with each other on a routine repair, Cally and Galen become trapped in a leaking airlock. Unable to get the inside door to cycle, the decision is made to get them out through the outer hatch and on to a rescue Raptor, a move that exposes the two of them to hard vacuum for a number of seconds. Both sustain serious decompression injuries as a result and Cally has to spend some time in a hyperbaric chamber. Realizing just how close he came to losing her, Tyrol reaffirms his commitment to her and their marriage. When he found out, Galen did not reveal to Cally he was a Cylon. The constant demands of his work, as well as his moodiness about his true nature, continue to strain their marriage. Cally becomes suspicious her husband is having an affair with Tory Foster. After finding a suspicious note, she sneaks into a crawl space above a storage room in time to hear part of the secret Cylon meeting and learn unequivocally her husband is one of them. Upon his return to quarters, she attacks and incapacitates Galen then takes her son to a Viper launch tube with the intention of killing both him and herself. Tory ‚Äî who suspected they were overheard ‚Äî follows her to the launch tube and talks her out of her plan, only to take the baby, knock her aside, then cycles the launch tube, killing her. Tyrol eventually discovers the truth about Cally's child not being his when the boy has a medical crisis and leaves Nicholas with his true father. Later, when the Final Five combine together in a datastream, Tyrol sees Tory's memory of killing Cally and strangles her to death, avenging Cally's death. This causes a series of events culminating with the destruction of the enemy humanoid Cylons and the discovery of a new planet that would eventually become Earth.  Character creation and notes  Originally, Cally was supposed to be little more than a named extra, but soon after the series began the producers came to enjoy Nicki Clyne's performance enough to want expand the role into an important recurring character. The original script for \\"Bastille Day\\" had called for a prison ship inmate to rape and kill the character, but Clyne had asked Ron Moore if Cally could instead fight back. Producer David Eick, originally jokingly, had suggested she would bite off the ear of her assailant. The idea stuck and the script was changed, thus saving the character. = Cally and her name = Until the third season, Cally and Doctor Cottle were the only frequently recurring characters who had yet to be given a full name. Through the first and second seasons she was referred to as \\"Cally\\" in most of the spoken dialogue. Up to the end of season three, the character was listed in the show credits as \\"Crewman Specialist Cally\\", implying \\"Cally\\" was actually the character's surname. Following her marriage to Galen Tyrol, she is referred to in Season 3 as \\"Cally Tyrol\\". Battlestar Galactica writer Bradley Thompson has appeared on the Battlestar Wiki discussion pages and said Cally is the character's first name and her last name is Henderson. Thompson has also made comments to this effect at Comic-Con. According to him, the art department used the name \\"Henderson\\" to label her locker, uniform, and other in-show props that belong to the character, though none of these have ever been clearly seen on the show. Actress Nicki Clyne herself has acknowledged in interviews although not spoken in dialogue so far, season three scripts had her listed as \\"Cally Henderson-Tyrol\\". The Battlestar Galactica: Official Season 3 Companion book by David Bassom also lists her character's name in season 3 as \\"Cally Henderson-Tyrol\\" For the premiere of Season 4, Cally was included in the updated Cast section of the Scifi Channel's official website and her name is listed as \\"Cally Henderson Tyrol\\". At her funeral in \\"Escape Velocity,\\" her full name is stated as \\"Callandra Henderson Tyrol.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Cally Tyrol on Battlestar Wiki * Cally Tyrol at Syfy Category:Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series) characters Category:Fictional female engineers Category:Television characters introduced in 2003 ","title":"Cally Henderson Tyrol"},{"id":"2751184","text":"Banwari Trace, an Archaic (pre-ceramic) site in southwestern Trinidad, is the oldest archaeological site in the Caribbean. The site has revealed two separate periods of occupation; one between 7200 and 6100 BP (Strata I and II) and the other between 6100 BP and 5500 BP. Origins Dated to about 5000 BCE or 7000 B.P (years Before Present), the archaeological site at Banwari Trace in southwestern Trinidad is the oldest pre-Columbian site in the West Indies. At this time, Trinidad was still part of South America. Archaeological research of the site has also shed light on the patterns of migration of Archaic (pre-ceramic) peoples from mainland South America to the Lesser Antilles via Trinidad between 5000 and 2000 BCE. Discovery In November 1969, the Trinidad and Tobago Historical Society discovered the remains of a human skeleton at Banwari Trace. Lying on its left-hand side, in a typical Amerindian ‚Äúcrouched‚Äù burial position along a northwest axis, Banwari Man (as it is now commonly called) was found 20-cm below the surface. Only two items were associated with the burial, a round pebble by the skull and needlepoint by the hip. Banwari Man was apparently interred in a shell midden and subsequently covered by shell refuse. Based on its stratigraphic location in the site‚Äôs archaeological deposits, the burial can be dated to the period shortly before the end of occupation, approximately 3,400 BC or 5,400 years old.http://wikimapia.org/10449924/Banwari-Trace-Archaeological-Site This skeleton is considered to be the oldest one found in the Caribbean. This demonstrates the presence of the Caribbean's first inhabitants. Artefacts found The Banwarian preceramic assemblage is highly distinctive, typically consisting of artifacts made of stone and bone. Objects associated with hunting and fishing include bone projectile points, most likely used for tipping arrows and fish spears, beveled peccary teeth used as fishhooks, and bipointed pencil hooks of bone which were intended to be attached in the middle to a fishing-line. A variety of ground stone tools were manufactured for the processing of especially vegetable foods, including blunt or pointed conical pestles, large grinding stones and round to oval manos. It should not be confused with the Ortoiran assemblage, which is much later ca BC 1000, and located in southeast Trinidad. http://trinidad-tobago.strabon- caraibes.org/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&catid;=29:pre- columbian&id;=78:banwari-man&Itemid;=58 Recognition In 2004, Banwari Trace was included in the 2004 World Monuments Watch, by the World Monuments Fund, a private international organization. It was hoped that listing would help garner the financial and technical support necessary to properly survey, document, preserve, interpret, and protect the site.

The river is said to be named for an indigenous people called Similkameigh, meaning \\"treacherous waters\\". History The first mention of the Similkameen by a European was by Alexander Ross. While on a trading expedition, he travelled by way of the \\"Similkameigh River.\\" Sir George Simpson used the name Similkameigh for one of the groups part of the Okanagan Nation, . The transition from Similkameigh to Similkameen may have been inspired by the name of the Tulameen River, despite being etymologically incorrect. The name Similkameigh comes from a now extinct language of Nicola- Similkameen, of the Athapascan languages, believed to mean \\"Salmon river.\\" GeographyCourse= It starts on the east flank of Manning Park, about north of Allison Pass and flows past the settlements of East Gate, Princeton, Hedley, Keremeos, and Cawston, closely followed by Highway 3, the Crowsnest Highway. About upstream from Princeton, the river drops over Similkameen Falls. Numerous viewpoints of the river occur from the highway, the most popular being Bromley Rock, where swimming in the river from a spectacular sandy beach is possible. In a typical Okanagan, BC summer, the water is warm and fantastic for swimming. It contributes 75% of the flow of the Okanogan River and crosses the international border at Nighthawk, Washington. =Flow= The United States Geological Survey maintains a stream gauge at river mile 15.8, just upstream from the Oroville‚ÄìTonasket Irrigation District canal intake.

History Gitanes was launched in 1910 in four different versions, all of which were filterless. In 1918, Gitanes Ma√Øs were introduced. which were a success in the rural areas of France. In the 1930s, the first graphic ads for Gitanes appeared. In 1956, the first filtered Gitane variant was introduced. In 1981, the \\"Light\\" versions are first marketed. In 1986, the first Gitanes Blondes were launched, which had become available internationally in 1987. However, they were a commercial failure. In 1988, the first \\"Extra light\\" versions were marketed. In 1991, Gitanes ultra lights were introduced. In 1990/1991, a simultaneous launch of a new version of Gitanes Blondes ultra light were brought on the market. A 2006 French pack of Gitanes which warning reads \\"Smoking kills\\" Gitanes are sold in many varieties of strengths and packages. The cigarette was originally made with a darker or brun (brown) tobacco, in contrast to the more widespread blonde. In honour of the name, the packet shows the silhouette of a Spanish gypsy woman playing the tambourine. There is a distinction between the \\"blonde\\" style of the current Gitanes, and the classic style of Gitanes Brunes, both of which are sold in Europe and South America (most commonly in Argentina and Chile). The classic Gitanes Brunes tobacco achieved its characteristic and distinctive \\"bite\\" by using a fire-flued method of curing the tobacco, and a \\"rice\\" type of rolling paper which differs from most other cigarettes. The result was a cigarette which had both a strong flavor and a distinctive aroma. Gitanes Blondes are available, filtered, in Light and Regular. The Gitanes Brunes are available in 70mm versions, filtered and unfiltered. In 2010, the size and content of the regular Gitanes were reduced. Gitanes Ma√Øs (corn) are made with yellow corn paper. Production in France was halted, with one factory remaining operational in the Netherlands. This was mainly due to the rise on tobacco levies imposed by the French Government in the wake of enforced EU health directives, which has forced up the price of French cigarettes to the level of those in the US, with the more aggressively promoted brands such as Marlboro now taking the majority market share. The 90s were particularly successful for Gitanes in terms of brand engagement. In an effort to increase awareness, the brand began sponsoring motor-sports such as Formula One racing and the Dakar Rally. These activities helped to attract a wider range of potential customers while avoiding any dilution of the brand image and thus retained the loyalty of its more artistic core customer base. In July 2016, the French government considered a ban on both the Gitanes and Gauloises cigarette brands because they were deemed \\"too stylish and cool\\". The ban would also apply to brands including Marlboro Gold, Vogue, Lucky Strike and Fortuna. It is the result of a new public health law based on a European directive that says tobacco products \\"must not include any element that contributes to the promotion of tobacco or give an erroneous impression of certain characteristics\\". Four major tobacco companies have written to the government seeking clarification on the potential law, calling for an urgent meeting to discuss the details of the plan. In the letter they accuse French health minister Marisol Touraine of an \\"arbitrary and disproportionate\\" application of EU directives. Since the 1930s, many advertisements have been made to promote the Gitanes brand. Packaging The first art-deco packet design was produced by Maurice Giot in 1927. An image of a Gypsy dancer, designed by Molusson, first appeared on the cigarette packets in 1943. In 1947, Max Ponty refined the figure to a silhouette to create an image that is still in use today on the Gitanes Blonde packet. The dancer silhouette was reworked by many famous poster designers, including Savignac in 1953 and Morvan in 1960.. The boxes have always featured the colours black, blue and white. Motorsport sponsorshipFormula One= The Ligier JS11/15 being demonstrated at the 2008 Goodwood Festival of Speed Gitanes had a long- standing partnership with the Equipe Ligier team. Following the acquisition of the Matra Formula One team's assets, Ligier entered Formula One in with a Matra V12-powered car, and won the 1977 Swedish Grand Prix with Jacques Laffite. This is generally considered to have been the first all-French victory in the Formula One World Championship.Chassis, engine and driver were French. The gearbox was British (Hewland) and the tyres American (Goodyear). Jean-Pierre Jabouille and Renault achieved victory at the 1979 French Grand Prix with an all-Renault car and Michelin tyres. In total the team won 8 races, got 47 podiums and earned 373 points during their partnership with Gitanes. In 1996, the sister company Gauloises became the new sponsor, ending a partnership that lasted 19 years. In 1997 the team was sold to Alain Prost and became Prost Grand Prix in . Prost GP, despite substantial financial backing by large private French companies, failed to make the team competitive and went bankrupt in . =Sports cars= After retiring from racing following the death of his friend Jo Schlesser, Guy Ligier decided to found his own team and had engineer Michel T√©tu develop a sports car named the JS1 (Schlesser's initials). The Cosworth-powered JS1 took wins at Albi and Monthlery in 1970, but retired at Le Mans and from the Tour Automobile de France. For 1971, Ligier had the JS1 developed into the JS2 and JS3. The JS2 was homologated for road use and used a Maserati V6 engine, while the JS3 was an open-top sports- prototype powered by a Cosworth DFV V8 engine. The JS3 won at Monthlery in 1971 but failed to finish the minimum distance in Le Mans. Therefore, it was retired, and Ligier installed the Cosworth DFV in the JS2 road car, finishing second overall at Le Mans in 1975. Guy Ligier then switched his efforts into Formula One. =Dakar Rally= Gitanes also sponsored various teams in the Dakar Rally from its first season in 1979 until tobacco sponsorship was banned by the French government. Popular cultureIn cinema= In the 1971 crime film Get Carter, Michael Caine's character Jack Carter can be seen smoking Gitanes in various scenes throughout the film. =In music= The cover of the album 1974 Dancing on a Cold Wind, by Carmen, and the cover of the album 1981 Shades, by JJ Cale, both use the Gitanes design. The brand is mentioned in the song \\"Late Bloomer\\", from the album The Voyager, by Jenny Lewis: \\"She was smoking on a gypsy.\\" David Bowie smoked these in his persona of The Thin White Duke. Serge Gainsbourg was a heavy Gitanes smoker and always appeared in public with his packet of Gitanes in his hand. The book A Fistful of Gitanes is about his life and career. Slash, guitarist for Guns N' Roses, smoked the brand and has a tattoo of the Gitanes logo on his back. =In books= The cigarettes appear prominently in Marc Behm's 1980 The Eye of the Beholder. Markets Gitanes is mainly sold in France, but also was or still is sold in Luxembourg, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Spain, Italy, Ukraine, Russia, Georgia, Egypt, Martinique, Israel, United Arab Emirates and Argentina.

Aerial view of the remaining part of Mescalitan Island (left) and the Goleta Sanitary Sewage Treatment Plant, with UCSB in the distance. The Goleta Slough is an area of estuary, tidal creeks, tidal marsh, and wetlands near Goleta, California, United States. It primarily consists of the filled and unfilled remnants of the historic inner Goleta Bay about 8 miles (13 km) west of Santa Barbara. The slough empties into the Pacific Ocean through an intermittently closed mouth at Goleta Beach County Park just east of the UCSB campus and Isla Vista. The slough drains the Goleta Valley and watershed, and receives the water of all of the major creeks in the Goleta area including the southern face of the Santa Ynez Mountains. The Santa Barbara Airport has the largest border on the slough and contains the largest part of the slough. UCSB, Isla Vista, the City of Goleta and other unincorporated areas of the county, including the landward bluffs of More Mesa, surround and encompass the rest of the slough. The Goleta Slough as it exists today is the result of two major historical events of the late 19th century and first half of the 20th century. The first was the heavy grazing by cattle on the surrounding foothills and mountainsides followed by wide-ranging grassfires, heavy rains in 1861/62, and flooding which caused so much erosion and deposition of sediment in the mouths of the creeks emptying into Goleta Bay that most of the bay became silt-filled salt marsh in just a couple of years. The second event was the filling and conversion of the marsh and remaining bay into a military airbase during World War II. This filling was completed by the reduction of the rest of Mescalitan Island, which was used for fill for the airport and the surrounding area. The former location of Mescalitan Island now contains a sewage treatment plant. While no longer having a regularly navigable mouth, nor depths in most places suitable for anything except canoes, kayaks, and very small boats, the slough remains a very important area of vital wetlands, salt marsh, and estuarian creeks. \\"The Goleta Slough wetlands ... are fragmented along the coast from More Mesa to UCSB Storke Campus\\". The Goleta Slough Ecological Reserve is administered by the Calif. Dept. of Fish and Game. The Slough contains approximately 430 acres (1.7 km¬≤) of wetland habitat (including the 360 acre (1.5 km¬≤) ecological reserve and at Storke Campus). The approximate historic area was 1,150 acres (4.7 km¬≤). \\"The primary function of the Ecological Reserve is to provide habitat for wildlife and a setting for educational and research activities. Public utility and transportation corridors traverse the wetlands, and airport runways, a sanitary treatment plant, a power generation station, and light industrial facilities are constructed on filled portions of the marsh.\\"  Historic use  Marine Corps Air Station Santa Barbara in 1944. \\"It is estimated that Native American peoples began inhabiting the area some 9,000 years ago. Early European explorers used the embayment as an anchorage for large ships until the 1860s. The severe winter storms of 1861/62 filled the embayment with sediment. Agricultural development in the slough began in the 1870s and the following decades saw the construction of berms, levees and roads to further facilitate agricultural development. In 1928 a landing strip was established in the northeastern portion of the slough, which was expanded in 1942-43 for construction of the Marine Corps Air Station, now the Municipal Airport.\\" The Marine station was known as Marine Corps Air Station Santa Barbara and became inactive in 1946.  Adjacent use  Goleta Slough is almost entirely surrounded by urban development, some of which extends into the wetlands. This includes the municipal airport to the north, the sewage treatment plant and the Southern California Gas Company's La Goleta Gas Field to the east, a public beach between the ocean and the slough, the campus of UC Santa Barbara to the south and west, and residential and light industrial operations to the north and west.  Adjacent historic use  Cattle ranching began in 1846 followed by agricultural development on the uplands around the slough. A whaling station was established in about 1870, asphaltum mining commenced in the 1890s, development of small farms expanded to cover the entire mesa in the 1920s, and rapid urbanization began in the 1940s.  Tidal influence  View from the slough to the ocean. Extensive areas of the historic marsh below the high tide line are isolated from tidal influence by berms and dikes. Tidal flooding is limited to the south-central portion of the slough, extending into several of the major tributaries. Tidal amplitude in the upper reaches of the slough is diminished. During the summer months the tidal amplitude may become attenuated and eventually eliminated by progressive berming of the mouth. The beach berm is mechanically breached to maintain water quality in the slough. The Slough is fed by a watershed area of 45 square miles (117 km¬≤).  Tributaries and flow  The major tributaries of the Slough are Tecolotito Creek, Carneros Creek, and Atascadero Creek. Tecolotito Creek's highest flows are during winter storms; during the summer flows are intermittent. Carneros Creek's major flows are of the flash flood type, with intermittent flows in the summer months. Atascadero Creek is a stream that generally has perennial freshwater flow that is augmented by seepage and landscape watering. Highest flows are during winter storms. Other flow sources are runoff from the north-facing bluffs of UC Santa Barbara campus and More Mesa.  Habitat  Kayaking in the slough. Habitat area has been surveyed for the City of Santa Barbara property, the largest portion of the wetlands. It is: *101 acres (409,000 m¬≤) of coastal salt marsh *15 acres (61,000 m¬≤) of mudflats *4 acres (16,000 m¬≤) of saltflats *28 acres (113,000 m¬≤) of creek and channels *8+ acres (32,000 m¬≤) of riverine (riparian) *198 acres (801,000 m¬≤) of Palustrine (vernal wetlands) *4.5 acres (18,000 m¬≤) of scrub/shrub and forested wetlands.  Vegetation  Vegetation includes pickleweed, alkali-heath, salt grass, Jaumea, salt bush, ditch-grass, pondweed, tule, and cattails. The shrubs include willows and coyote brush. The trees are primarily southern coastal oak.  Animals  Long-billed curlew in the Goleta Slough. Animals using the wetlands include birds, fish, benthic invertebrates, insects, and other wildlife. 279 species of birds have been observed at Goleta Slough; of these 121 were water-associated, including 20 species of special status. 10 species of fish were identified in a 1993 sampling, dominated by Killifish, Topsmelt, Arrow goby (Clevelandia ios), and Western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis)*. A gravid Steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) was collected in Tecolotito creek in 1995. Benthic invertebrates species composition is characterized by low diversity and densities. Three species of polychaetes and bivalves are identified. The epifaunal invertebrates that are abundant included the lined shore crab, yellow shore crab, and California horn snail. November 1993 insect surveys conducted with a fine mesh seine or aquarium dip nets at the mouth and the back portion of the slough yielded 11 species; major taxonomic groups were bugs, damselflies, mayflies, beetles, caddisflies, butterflies and flies. 1986/87 trapping and visual surveys at the Storke Campus Wetlands identified two species of mice, one vole, one amphibian, and two species of reptiles. 1996 report identified the Western pond turtle (Actinemys marmorata) in Atascadero Creek from surveys in 1982 and 1994. The 1996 report also identified three special status species from a 1983 survey of the Ecological Reserve: Pallid bat (Antrozous pallidus), American badger (Taxidea taxus), and San Diego black-tailed jackrabbit (L. californicus bennettii). Ten species of mammals were identified in 1970 survey of the main portion of the slough. Special Status Species A 1996 report identified 20 special status species from various surveys (dates not specified): California brown pelican, southern bald eagle, peregrine falcon, snowy plover, common loon, American white pelican, double-crested cormorant, white-faced ibis, fulvous whistling duck, harlequin duck, northern harrier, golden eagle, osprey, long-billed curlew, California gull, elegant tern, and black skimmer. Those with specified dates included Belding's Savannah sparrow (1994), and California horned lark (1995). The 1996 report identified the following mammals from a 1983 survey; pallid bat, American badger, and the San Diego black-tailed jackrabbit.

He has worked closely with writing partner David Simon. For HBO, they have collaborated on The Corner, The Wire, Generation Kill, and The Plot Against America. Burns is a former Baltimore police detective for the Homicide and Narcotics divisions, and a public school teacher. He often draws upon these experiences for his writing. Biography Burns served in the infantry during the Vietnam War. He then served in the Baltimore Police Department for twenty years. When he worked in Homicide his partner was Detective Harry Edgerton, who would later become the basis for Frank Pembleton on the television series Homicide: Life on the Street. Following his retirement from the police force he became a teacher in the Baltimore public school system. Burns has said that he stumbled into teaching with little preparation because of the intense demand for teachers in inner-city schools. He taught seventh and eight grade. Psychologically, he compared the experience of teaching to the Vietnam War. He found the experience profoundly challenging because of the emotional damage that the vast majority of his students had already experienced before reaching the classroom. He saw his primary role as instilling caring behavior in his pupils. He felt his major impact was in giving the children an example of an \\"adult who's consistent, who's always there, who always comes through with what he said, then that's a new world for them.\\" =The Corner= In 1995, he co-authored, with Simon, The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood, the true account of a West Baltimore community dominated by a heavy drug market. Simon credits his editor John Sterling with the notion that he observed a single drug corner. It was named a Notable Book of the Year by The New York Times. An adaptation of the book, also called The Corner, was produced as a six-hour TV miniseries for HBO. The show received three Emmy Awards. =The Wire= Burns was a producer, writer, and co-creator (also with Simon) of the HBO series The Wire. They originally set out to create a police drama loosely based on Burns' experiences working on protracted investigations of violent drug dealers using surveillance technology. He had often faced frustration with the bureaucracy of the police department, which Simon equated with his own ordeals as a police reporter for The Baltimore Sun. Writing against the background of current events, including institutionalized corporate crime at Enron and institutional dysfunction in the Catholic Church, the show became \\"more of a treatise about institutions and individuals than a straight cop show.\\" They chose to take The Wire to HBO because of their existing working relationship from the 2000 miniseries The Corner. Owing to its reputation for exploring new areas, HBO was initially dubious about including a cop drama in their lineup, but eventually agreed to produce the pilot. The theme of institutional dysfunction was expanded across different areas of the city as the show progressed. The second season focused on the death of white working class America through examination of the city ports. The third season \\"reflects on the nature of reform and reformers, and whether there is any possibility that political processes, long calcified, can mitigate against the forces currently arrayed against individuals.\\" Burns has called education the theme of the fourth season. The writing drew extensively on his experience as a teacher. Rather than solely focusing on the school system, the fourth season looks at schools as a porous part of the community that are affected by problems outside their boundaries. Burns states that education comes from many sources other than schools and that children can be educated by other means, including contact with the drug dealers they work for. The fifth and final season focuses on the media's coverage of crime and corruption in Baltimore, tapping into Simon's past with The Sun. Burns was nominated for the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Dramatic Series at the February 2009 ceremony for his work on the fifth season. Simon and Burns collaborated to write the series finale \\"-30-\\". The show was nominated for several Emmys and numerous other awards. =Generation Kill= Burns traveled to Africa to film a miniseries as a producer and writer for Generation Kill (airdates July 13 to August 24, 2008) for HBO Network. The seven-part miniseries received 10 Emmy nominations. His influence on the show stems from the year he spent in Vietnam. Burns stated that as a writer \\"(He) can use the universal experience of war to create a realistic scenario for the viewers.\\" He also drew from his experience as a writer for The Wire. David Simon and Burns wrote for both shows and had similar ideas in characterisation for the show. Burns stated that he wanted \\"To make characters into characters, not cliches. Just as we did on The Wire.\\" = The Plot Against America = Burns co-created the HBO miniseries The Plot Against America with Simon. The six episode miniseries premiered in 2020.

Inhabited by Romanians, Sz√©kelys and other Hungarians, Germans, Serbs, Slovaks, Gypsies and others, Transylvania has long been a center for folk music from all of these different cultures. Bart√≥k and Kod√°ly collected many folk songs from Transylvania early in the 20th century. Kod√°ly's Sz√©kelyfon√≥ (The Spinning Room) uses folk tunes from the area. In our days, Deep Forest included folk songs from Transylvania on their albums. Violin, kontra and double bass, sometimes with a cimbalom, are the most integral ensemble unit. They are used to play a wide variety of songs, including numerous kinds of specific wedding songs. Hungarians from Transylvania, which make up around 20% of the population of Transylvania, are known for their vibrant musical cultures, famous examples being hajnali songs and leg√©nyes (young men's dance). In fact, Transylvania was an important center for Hungarian music in the 16th century because at that time it was the only independent Hungarian province not occupied by the Ottoman Empire. Drum, guitar and violin make up the typical band in Maramure≈ü, and virtuoso fiddlers are also popular in the area. At the end of the 1990s, the Maramuzical music festival was organized to draw attention to the Romanian music of the area.

Performers include a gangsta rap pioneer, Ganxsta Zolee, his local fellow Dopeman, L.L. Junior and Sub Bass Monster. These artists reveled in relative obscurity outside Hungary until Speak released a video which garnered worldwide attention as well as over 2 million views on YouTube.  The beginning and domination in mainstream  It began with a rapper named Ganxsta \\"D√∂gl√©gy\\" Zolee (b. Zolt√°n Zana, January 7, 1968) and his clique The Kartel. He is the son of high-class actor family and is a professional ice-hockey player. In musical grounds he was originally the drummer for a hard rock band Sex Action before forming his then-underground gangsta rap collective in 1995. Their first album Egyenesen a gett√≥b√≥l (English: Straight out the ghetto) was not a commercial success and gained little radio airplay, though their first single \\"Boom a fejbe\\" (Eng.: Boom to the head\\") reached the top 20 on a major record megastore sales chart that was published weekly in Danubius R√°di√≥ (the only commercial radio station with full country coverage then). Their second LP J√©gre teszlek (Eng.: Put you on ice) and Helldorado was a big success with the latter having a Latino rap style influence and being certified platinum (50,000). The mainstream and the underground The underground hip hop artist always attacked the mainstream hip hop artists because their music is too popular and they are \\"selling\\" their music for everybody. The underground hip hop musician's creations are most imaginative and have more message than the mainstream. The most well-known Hungarian underground hip hop publishers are: Kriminal Beats, WacuumAirs, Gimmeshot, S-10, Garage, Bloose Broavaz. Gangsta rap Meanwhile one of the members of the Kartel, Lory B left the crew and converted a born again Christian and starting a solo effort in Christian rap. Another member O.G. S√°mson release \\"Ganjaman\\" a single written in jungle rap genre that became also successful thanks to its weed-worshipper lyrics and nudist video. The group adopted a new member Dopeman who had street creditibility with his suburban-gipsy background. His trademark is a rapping technique similar to Master P's \\"Uhh!\\" sound and the use of enjambements in his verses. Later he quit the band and started a solo career as well as producing new artists including acts such as Fekete Vonat (Eng.: Black Train) a trio who have used traditional roma techniques in their hip hop recordings and MC Ducky a female rapper and Majka Papa a former Val√≥ Vil√°g (Real World) runner-up. His own album Magyarorsz√°g r√©m√°lma (Eng.: Nightmare of Hungary) became a gold album (15,000) in 2000 and Fekete Vonat's A v√°ros m√°sik oldal√°n (Eng.: On the other side of the city) has reached platinum in 2001. It contained the title track with the same name, which gained major radio airplay as well as TV videoplay. Its tune was sampled from Bill Withers' \\"Just the two of us\\". In 2003 Majka's Az √≥zdi h≈ës (Eng.: The Hero of √ìzd) was also awarded gold and had a duo single with his producer sampling the Dr. Dre beat Nuthin' But a \\"G\\" Thang. The street-macho image has been strengthened by a TV boxing ceremony entitled Starbox, an attempt to get rival celebrities into a fistfight. All Majka, Zolee and Dopeman participated and fought well. Comedy rap Simultaneously a new genre of rap was about to emerge, which was much more built upon the unique features of Hungarian language in rhyming, word- plays, jokes and ambiguities. First it was developed by the RAP√ºl≈ëk (1992-1994) and then by the hip hop duo Animal Cannibals beginning from 1995. In the same year their first single \\"Takar√≠t√≥n≈ë\\" (Eng.: Cleaning Lady) was a hit with radio and TV airplay. They were the first Hungarian group ever to get played in MCM a French music TV station (single \\"K√©rek egy puszik√°t!\\"). Their success inspired many upcoming groups and by utilizing their fame Animal Cannibals launched a new series of MC battles nationwide in local clubs called the Fila Rap Jam in 1996. Its goal is to invite the winners to Budapest into a final contest in which the champion selected by the audience is given a record deal. One of their first newfound talents was Sub Bass Monster, whose first album F√©lre az √∫tb√≥l (Eng.: Get out of the way) went platinum in 2000 and the second one gold in 2001. An example of his funny metaphors is the title of his third single \\"N√©gy √útem\\" (Eng.: Four Strokes) that was a reference to the four steps of breathing in marihuana. In some characteristics the style as a whole can be compared to those from Eminem's first solo material as well as to D-12's. R&B; Rhythm and Blues is still in its infancy in Hungary. Few blue-eyed soul musicians are trying to phase the genre into the Hungarian market. One of them is L.L. Junior who has taken his name from LL Cool J one of his childhood idols. He is an ex-member of the Fekete Vonat. He has been moderately successful making four albums but only managed to sell ten thousand of his third album that was his highest selling achievement. Aftermath Until 2006 Gangsta Zolee and The Kartel's first disc also received platinum status and due to Hungarian sales awards changes during the years it has become the only recording to reach the 120,000 copies platinum limit in the post-communist music history of Hungary and still remains the highest selling rap and pop CD ever (although bootlegging and high taxes on data medium have a very big and growing effect on the low sales indexes). The limit has been gradually lowered right after and was set to 20,000. Ten albums and one greatest hits were recorded by the Kartel from which five are gold and two are platinas. They also composed the main theme for the 2001 Division I Ice hockey championship in Hungary as well as for boxer Janos \\"Bonebreaker\\" Nagy a former IBO world junior-lightweight champion and WBO world junior-lightweight champion title challenger against Jorge Rodrigo Barrios. They also remade American songs for example Revolving Door and Check Yo Self. Recently one of Zolee's former prot√©g√©s Ogli G got paroled and formed a new label and released Egyenesen a f√©rfih√°zb√≥l (Eng.: Straight outta the brothel) that is - in its title - a homage to the Kartel's first record. He's the first gangsta rapper whose reputation is backed up with a prison sentence. Ganxsta Zolee nowadays gets into acting and participating in political late night shows. Dopeman has recently played in his own reality show. Ogli is looking for an American record deal.

It was dubbed into English by Hong Kong voice actors. The anime film's premise involves an advanced robot police squad trying to recover a hijacked prototype tank. The film is an early anime presentation for a slightly older audience, at a time when there wasn't much competition and before the clich√©s were established for this genre of action. The anime was made during the Cold War and so the tank was hijacked from a futuristic cargo plane and was designed to withstand a neutron bomb attack, even if its crew would be killed by that weapon, for the tank was computerized to continue to fight on its own. When out of ammunition, the robot tank would automatically explode. One point which marks the animation studio of this film is that to save money there are many scenes which are monochromatic. When the hijackers are in the vehicle they stole, everything on screen is blue; when Eleanor starts to drive it back, everything on screen is red. Another scene towards the beginning has the Techno Police headquarters in blue.  Characters  Set at the start of the 21st century, its main character is Ken, a motorcycle-mounted highway patrolman in what is presumably the American Southwest, who is called to join the police force in Centinel City (the name comes from centennial, not sentinel), where he is only expected to last six months. He can be described as flighty, although as the movie progresses, he gets more serious. He is also known to wreck his motorcycles frequently in pursuit of criminals; he is shown in the beginning of the movie leaping from one onto a truck, and as the movie proper opens, his cycle is yet again trashed, barely making it to the station. An African American partner eyes the bike, and inquires \\"how many that is.\\" Ken shrugs, and replies that it might be the sixth that month. Ken's team consists of a woman named Eleanor and a husky male named Gora Kosaka (whom, to the Japanese audience, has a feminine name) and who grows flowers. Each has a robot to direct for police work‚Äînot a Giant Robot that they would control from inside, but a robot that is crudely presented as stupid, as a computer has to be trained to do everything. Ken's, Blader, is blue and white and equipped with a projectile handcuff, much like C.O.P.S.' LongArm. Eleanor's, Scanny, is red and has a female figure, but whose face is composed entirely of blinking LEDs, and which has two cables streaming from the neck, and which plug into computer sockets. Gora's robot, Vigobus, is bigger, and is stronger than the other two (at one point in the movie, it lifts the tank that the anime is built around, and keeps it immobile for several minutes with some strain; it lets go only when the tank becomes active again). These robots ride in the back of a large, six-wheeled, roofless police car which is red and white. A trailer is attached to pull along Gora's robot. Ken sits in the middle to drive it; Eleanor on his right and his other partner on his left.  Plot synopsis  The plot consists of a chase of a hijacked MBT-99A tank, designed by the United States Air Force. The hijackers, who appear inside the tank after getting away from a recently committed bank robbery, were hired by a shadowy group backed by a foreign nation seeking an edge in their military. The tank carries six ATGM launchers, three to each side of the turret, and a laser-based machine-gun-esque installment, in addition to its rifled main gun. The tank's treads are dual-mounted (the tread is split in half, making four sets of treads for the tank). Another tank involved is the MBT-90D, which are dispatched by the Army to take out the tank. Despite having at least a platoon of these, the MBT-99 still evades capture. The M-90Ds are armed with a three-barreled autocannon, three ATGM missile launchers and a main cannon, mounted on the front instead of on a turret. The MBT-99's hijackers are forced out by Ken and his team. Eleanor then enters to study the tank, and it starts up on its own, having been programmed by the hijackers to head for a pier and drive off its end so as to rendezvous with an enemy submarine. The rest of the movie is made up of the chase through the city, resulting in the destruction of another bank and various collateral damage.

Ltd., Toho Eizou Co. Ltd., Studio Nue, Dragon Productions Co. Ltd.  Development  Techno Police 21C started out life in 1978 as an idea from Artmic Studio founder Toshimichi Suzuki. Work began on developing the idea into a TV series as a co-production between Artmic and Studio Nue. The technology to be featured in the series was heavily researched with the intention of making the future as believable as possible. Unfortunately, the project hit problems. After 4 years in development there was only enough animation produced for a single episode. The series was scrapped and, in order to recover some of the costs, the existing footage was compiled into an 80-minute movie and distributed by Toho. Set in a futuristic 2001 in the Hi-Tech yet violent and crime filled metropolis of Centinel City. A reckless young traffic officer Kyosuke (Ken) is hand picked by for a special assignment far from his countryside home. He was chosen to become one of the first officers of a newly created arm of the SCPD, one which uses robotic assistants, known as Technoids, to give them an edge over the criminals. Together with his robot Blader and fellow Technopolice members Kosuga (Gora) (accompanied by the super strong Technoid Vigorus) and Eleanor (with the computer hacking female robot Scanny) Kyosuke take on the well equipped criminals that plague the city, including a runaway, prototype military tank. Of the staff that worked on the aborted TV show two are most notable. The first is Joe Hisaishi, who provides the synth-jazz score and is well known in the west for having created the score for nearly all Hayao Miyazaki movies including Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke and Nausicaa and Takeshi Kitano's (Sonatine, Hana-bi, Brother). Working as part of the animation staff is Shoji Kawamori who is now famous for his mecha designs particularly on the seminal Super Dimension Fortress Macross. Scale model kit company Aoshima, in anticipation of the proposed TV show, had produced a number of tie-in plastic kits of Technopolice's vehicles and robots, including a few designs which never animated. These were still released, in hopes to make money from the movie instead. As well as 1/16 scale kits of the Techroids and 1/48 kits of the Mazurka, Temjin and Roadranger other items of merchandising included a soundtrack, on LP and cassette and the eventual release of the movie on both VHS and Laserdisc. Undeterred by Technopolice's failure Toshimichi Suzuki returned to his original idea, some years later reworking it as the OAV series Bubblegum Crisis, which fared slightly better but in the end suffered a similar fate. In 1983 Technopolice 21C was dubbed by those ubiquitous Hong Kong kung fu voice actors (see also Battle For Moon Station Dallos and Locke the Superpower). The company responsible for the commissioning this new English track is unknown, they also made a few changes to the movie, moving the title card to the very start and pausing the individual shots of the opening credits to remove the Japanese text without shortening the running time or messing with the music. Also the end credits are missing entirely but otherwise the content of the movie itself is unchanged. This English language version was released on video in the UK by Mountain Video (Frankenstein, Dracula, Mazinger Z) under the slightly shorter title Techno Police. With the advent of the 1984 Video Recordings Act the video was withdrawn from shelves and disappeared into obscurity never to be re-released. Re-edited and redubbed scenes from Techno Police also appeared in Mountain Video's obscure Flash! No.1 Video Comic and its spin-off Flash! Robot Issue. These two tapes, released on VHS, Betamax and V-2000, were intended to advertise their collection of children's by collecting short clips of them together in a mock comic-book-on-video format. Both issues were released in 1983. The American market would not get to see Blader (now known as just Blade) in action until 1987 when Techno Police found its way to the shelves thanks to Celebrity's Just For Kids label (Battle for Earth Station S/1, Revenge of the Ninja Warrior), and later from Best Film and Video. The Best Film and Video version is slightly less edited, featuring some mild swearing. Outside of the English speaking world unedited video versions of Technopolice 21C were seen in France, Germany and Spain with a theatrical run in Cuba, witch were dubbed using the english dub.  Rerelease  In 1994/5 Techno Police was re-released by Best Film & Video Co on NTSC VHS to cash in on the popular rise in anime and cyberpunk with OAVs such as Bubblegum Crisis, Appleseed, Dangaioh, Patlabor, AD Police, Armitage 3 and Cyber City Oedo 808. Release Date: April 15, 1995; run time: 80 minutes; ASIN: 6303388019.

To date, Anderson has released over forty albums, with his latest full length, Astronaut Meets Appleman, released in 2016. Anderson is also a member of Scottish-Canadian band The Burns Unit. In 2011, Anderson's collaborative album with Jon Hopkins, Diamond Mine, was nominated for the Mercury Prize and the Scottish Album of the Year Award. Astronaut Meets Appleman was also longlisted for the Scottish Album of the Year Award. Musical career After having featured in Scottish bands Skuobhie Dubh Orchestra and Khartoum Heroes, in 1995 Kenny Anderson launched the Fence record label and began recording albums under the name King Creosote. King Creosote was one of the original artists to contribute a t-shirt design for the Yellow Bird Project charity initiative, back in 2006. Anderson's design features an accordion, inscribed with the name \\"FENCE\\"; a reference to his DIY record label collective. Anderson founded Fence Records alongside Johnny Lynch, but stepped back from day-to-day running of the label in 2010. In recent years, Anderson has teamed up with Domino Records who have co-released some of his albums. He also spent some time on Warner subsidiary, 679, which gave him major label backing for the first time. His increasing frustration with the music industry and how digital recordings are becoming throwaway commodities led him to release his material in small, vinyl only runs which were largely only available at concerts. To this end, KC Rules OK was re-released in 2006 with different versions of some songs, and a version of the album called \\"Chorlton and the Wh'earlies\\" recorded with The Earlies was available with some purchases. Bombshell was released with an additional disc, a DVD film of King Creosote and friends on tour. In the 2007 film Hallam Foe two of his songs, \\"The Someone Else\\" and \\"King Bubbles in Sand\\", were featured. In late 2009, Anderson released a new studio album Flick the Vs, and crafted a performance only album, entitled My Nth Bit of Strange in Umpteen Years. Anderson also contributed to the Cold Seeds collaborative album along with Frances Donnelly of Animal Magic Tricks, and Neil Pennycook and Pete Harvey from Meursault; which was released on the Edinburgh-based indie label Song, by Toad Records. Anderson, Donnelly and Pennycook all wrote songs for the project, which all four performers then recorded together; each singer often taking the lead vocal role on a song written by another of the artists. The album was given a special limited release at the Fence Records Homegame Festival in Anstruther, Fife in March 2010, before a general release was announced for June 2010. In 2011, Anderson attended the SxSW Music Festival and played a number of shows, two of which featured fellow Scottish attendees Kid Canaveral as his backing band. The same year, Anderson released Diamond Mine, a collaborative album with electronica composer Jon Hopkins, to critical acclaim. The album was nominated for the Mercury Prize, with Anderson stating, \\"It feels like this is the beginning of something. And to feel that so far down the line, after putting out forty effing albums, oh my God! It means, I can still do this, it's not over.\\" The duo subsequently released an EP, Honest Words. In 2013, Anderson released That Might Well Be It, Darling, a full-band re-recording of his limited edition vinyl album That Might Be It, Darling. In 2014, Anderson created the soundtrack for a film about Scotland for the 2014 Commonwealth Games. From Scotland with Love is a poetic film exploring the history of the country, compiled entirely from archive footage with no commentary or narration. Speaking to The Guardian about the creative process, Anderson explained that the film was a long way from the typical \\"tartan, Highland Games, shortbread kind of tourist film\\". It was broadcast on BBC Scotland in June. Personal life Anderson's brothers are also musicians: Ian Anderson (known as Pip Dylan) and Gordon Anderson (Lone Pigeon) ‚Äì who is lead singer and main songwriter with The Aliens. The three frequently collaborate at live shows and on album releases. He also has a sister living in Australia. Anderson lives in Fife. He has three daughters: two with his partner, Jen Gordon (a.k.a. musician HMS Ginafore).

Cpl. Teather was born in Hamilton, Ontario where he joined the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in September 1967. Upon graduation he began and ended his service in British Columbia RCMP \\"E\\" Division. During Cpl. Teather's 30-year career with the RCMP he worked in Uniform Patrol and as a Hostage Taker-Barricaded Person Negotiator. He was also a RCMP Diver and Diving Instructor who lectured to police officers, firefighters, doctors and others throughout Canada and the U.S.A., on diving techniques, underwater crime scene photography, ice diving procedures and many other topics that are diving related. Cpl Teather was also the driving force behind getting a dive team up and operational within \\"E\\" Division. It was as a result of his persistence and dedication that the \\"E\\" Division Dive Team (known today as the Underwater Recovery Team) was formally recognized on April 1, 1977. Cpl. Teather died at the age of 57, on November 15, 2004 at Surrey Memorial Hospital of natural causes after a battle with diabetes. Rescue On 26 September 1981, Corporal Robert Teather, a member of the Surrey Detachment Diving Team of the R.C.M.P., rescued two fishermen trapped in the overturned hull of a boat. Early that morning, the boat Respond collided with a freighter near the mouth of the Fraser River, in British Columbia. The boat capsized with the two crewmen stranded on board. Cpl. Teather and a colleague arrived on the scene and an exploratory dive proved that only one could enter the hull at a time. Teather was inexperienced in this type of rescue, but was aware that the boat was sinking and that qualified help was miles away. Despite the lack of personnel support and unaware if the two crew members were alive he entered the companionway. As visibility was limited to a few centimetres inside as he made his way into the engine room. Most of the way through the ship was done by touch. When he reached the galley, he opened the door, and made his way to front of the vessel. In an air pocket fouled by diesel fumes he found the two men, one of them a non-swimmer, and their pet dog. He instructed both on the use of underwater breathing equipment, and then took the non-swimmer on his back to safety. The door to the galley that Teather had opened shut on him, and he managed to feel his way around to the handle to open it. During that time, the seaman panicked and knocked his rescuer's mask off, but Teather managed to pin the man against the wall of the galley, put the man's goggles and rebreather back on, get the man to the surface where the other diver took over. Teather then retrieved the other survivor. While at the surface, Teather strongly suggested that he go back down to the vessel with a bucket filled with air, put the dog's head in the bucket, and assist the dog in reaching the surface. Senior officials frowned upon the idea, stating the dog's life is not worth his own with the possibility of being trapped in the vessel. Consequently, he was relieved to find the next day when the ship was towed to shore and up onto the dock, the dog somehow managed to stay alive and came out of the ship. Had Teather not undertaken the rescue, the two fishermen would likely have drowned or succumbed to asphyxiation. = Recognition = For his efforts, Teather was awarded the Cross of Valour, the highest ranking of the Canadian Bravery Decorations. Currently, there have been only 20 recipients of this award; he was Canada's 13th recipient. On February 10, 2011, Gail Shea, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans announced that the nine new vessels in a new class of midshore patrol vessels would be named the Hero-class patrol vessels, and would each be named after a Canadian hero. One of the new vessels has been named CCGS Corporal Teather C.V.. Author Cpl. Teather was a published author whose works included On Patrol with the Royal Canadian Mounted, Mountie Makers, The Scarlet Tunic, and Encyclopedia of Underwater Investigations; which is now part of the course training standards for police divers.

The Nathaniel Hawthorne Birthplace is the home where American author Nathaniel Hawthorne was born. It is located at 27 Hardy Street but accessible through 54 Turner Street, Salem, Massachusetts. The house is now a nonprofit museum along with the House of the Seven Gables immediately adjacent; an admission fee is charged. History The house, originally standing at 27 Union Street, was built sometime between 1730 and 1745 for a Boston mariner named Joshua Pickman.Tolles, Jr., Bryant F. Architecture in Salem: An Illustrated Guide. Lebanon, NH: University Press of New England, 2004: 67.

New York: Random House, 2003: 18. He purchased the building in 1772. After a courtship of more than six years, Nathaniel Hathorne Sr. married Elizabeth Clarke Manning on August 2, 1801, when the new Mrs. Hathorne was already pregnant.Wineapple, Brenda. Hawthorne: A Life. New York: Random House, 2003: 17. She had known the family for many years; only a small garden separated her own family house from the Hathorne's Union Street home. Unable to afford a home of their own, the couple moved into the Union Street house, where the groom's widowed mother and three unmarried siblings already lived. The Mannings, Hawthorne's maternal family, were wealthier and, by the time of the Hathornes' wedding, had bought most of the property on Union Street and Herbert Street. Hawthorne was born in the house on July 4, 1804, and lived in the house until his father died at sea when the future author was four years old. The family then moved into property owned by the Mannings on Herbert Street. Sophia Peabody, who would eventually become the author's wife, moved with her family in 1812 to a home on Union Street at the Essex Street corner.Marshall, Megan. The Peabody Sisters: Three Women Who Ignited American Romanticism. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2005: 65‚Äì66.

Hawthorne's Haunts in New England. Charleston, SC: The History Press, 2008: 47. Years later, in 1853, Hawthorne wrote of his birthplace in the National Review: \\"I was born in the town of Salem, Massachusetts, in a house built by my grandfather, who was a maritime personage. The old household estate was in another part of the town, and had descneded in the family ever since the settlement of the country; but this old man of the sea exchanged it for a lot of land situated near the wharves, and convenient to his business, where he built the house... and laid out a garden, where I rolled on a grass-plot under an apple-tree and picked abundant currants.\\"Wright, John Hardy. Hawthorne's Haunts in New England. Charleston, SC: The History Press, 2008: 15. His mother Elizabeth also described Hawthorne's birthplace in a letter to one of his daughters, circa 1865: \\"Your father was born in 1804, on the 4th of July, in the chamber over the little parlour in the house in Union Street, which then belonged to my grandmother [Rachel Phelps] Hathorne, who lived in one part of it... I remember that one morning my mother called my brother into her room, next to the one where we slept, and told him that his father was dead. He left very little property, and my grandfather [Richard] Manning took us home.\\"Wright, John Hardy. Hawthorne's Haunts in New England. Charleston, SC: The History Press, 2008: 17. In 1958, the home was moved, without a later ell that had been added, to its current location on the grounds of the Turner-Ingersoll mansion, which Hawthorne had made famous in his novel The House of the Seven Gables (1851). It reflects typical architecture for the period: a central chimney, gambrel roof, front and back stairways, and a post-and-lintel doorway. The ground floor is laid out with kitchen to the right and main room to the left. The second floor has front and back rooms on each side. Most of the interior has been preserved intact.

She was the third recipient of the Cross of Valour and the first to receive the prize herself, as two previous awards were both posthumous. In December 1975 she was awarded the Cross of Valour for bravery, where at the same time, John Joseph Arpin, the purser, received the Star of Courage and the aircraft Captain Vernon Ehman the Medal of Bravery. At the risk of losing her life, Dohey declined an offer of safe release from an Air Canada DC-8 to remain with her fellow crew members and pacify hijacker Paul Cini, on flight 812 from Calgary, Alberta on November 12, 1971. During eight hours of terror, the hijacker, with a black hood over his head, was armed with a shotgun and two bundles of dynamite.

It was also the first publication of the company that would become DC Comics. Publication history Cover photo of the first issue of the series. In the latter half of 1934, having seen the emergence of Famous Funnies and other oversize magazines reprinting comic strips, Major Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson founded National Allied Publications and published New Fun #1 on January 11, 1935 (cover-dated February 1935). A tabloid-sized, 10-inch by 15-inch, 36-page magazine with a card-stock, non-glossy cover, it was an anthology of humor features, such as the funny animal comic \\"Pelion and Ossa\\" and the college-set \\"Jigger and Ginger\\", mixed with such dramatic fare as the Western strip \\"Jack Woods\\" and the \\"yellow peril\\" adventure \\"Barry O'Neill\\", featuring a Fu Manchu-styled villain, Fang Gow. The first issue also featured humor strip \\"Caveman Capers\\", an adaptation of the 1819 novel Ivanhoe, spy drama \\"Sandra of the Secret Service\\", and a strip based on an early Walt Disney creation, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. Most significantly, however, whereas some of the existing publications had eventually included a small amount of original material, generally as filler, New Fun #1 was the first comic book containing all-original material. Additionally, it carried advertising, whereas previous comic books were sponsored by corporations such as Procter & Gamble, Kinney Shoes, and Canada Dry beverages, and ad-free.

He was born in the Bronx, New York. During the 1930s, he was central to three (, and ) National League champion Chicago Cubs teams. In July 1932, Jurges recovered from gunshot wounds‚Äîsuffered when a distraught former girlfriend tried to kill him‚Äîto help lead the Cubs to the pennant. Career as a player A right-handed batter and thrower who stood tall and weighed , Jurges batted .258 in 1,816 games over 17 seasons. He collected 1,613 hits, with 245 doubles, 55 triples and 43 home runs. Although he was a light hitter, Jurges was known as a top-flight fielder as a shortstop. Baseball Reference credits him with leading in the National League in such defensive categories as Defensive Wins Above Replacement and Range Factor. He led NL shortstops in fielding percentage four times and in double plays once. During his first eight seasons (1931‚Äì38) in Chicago, he anchored an infield of Stan Hack (third base), Billy Herman (second base), and Charlie Grimm or Phil Cavarretta (first base). He then played seven more seasons (1939‚Äì45) with the New York Giants, missing over 90 games in after he was hit in the head by a pitched ball. However, he recovered to play regularly for the Giants from 1941 to 1943. He then returned to the Cubs as a player-coach in 1946‚Äì47. For a while, during the off-seasons in the 1930s, Jurges stayed in shape by working out at the Waple Studio of Physical Culture in Alexandria, Virginia. Shooting On July 6, 1932, Violet Valli, a showgirl with whom Jurges was romantically linked, tried to kill Jurges at the Hotel Carlos, where both lived. Jurges had previously tried to end their relationship. Valli (born Violet Popovich) also left a suicide note in which she blamed Cubs outfielder Kiki Cuyler for convincing Jurges to break up with her. Although initial reports stated that Jurges was shot while trying to wrestle the gun from Valli, later reports, based on Valli's suicide note, stated that she was trying to kill Jurges as well as commit suicide. A week after the shooting, charges were dismissed against Valli when Jurges appeared in court and announced that he would not testify and wished to drop the charges. Valli was later involved in a lawsuit when she sued a real estate developer who was blackmailing her by threatening to release letters in which Valli threatened Jurges. The shooting of Jurges ‚Äî and/or a later shooting of fellow ballplayer Eddie Waitkus at a Chicago hotel in 1949 ‚Äî may have inspired author Bernard Malamud in penning the story of Roy Hobbs in his novel The Natural, which was published in 1952 and made into a Hollywood film starring Robert Redford and Glenn Close in 1984. Career as coach, manager and scout Jurges was a full-time coach for the Cubs in 1948 under manager Grimm. Then, after leaving the Cubs, Jurges managed briefly in the farm systems of the Cleveland Indians and Milwaukee Braves, before returning to the coaching ranks with the original Washington Senators franchise in . On July 3, , still a Washington coach, he was named the surprise manager of the Boston Red Sox, who had fired Pinky Higgins. Jurges' appointment was hurriedly announced by Boston general manager Bucky Harris without consulting owner Tom Yawkey.Smiles, Jack, Boy Wonder: A Biography of Baseball's Bucky Harris. Jefferson, N.C.: Macfarland & Company, p. 262‚Äì268 Managing from the third-base coach's box, Jurges was able to rally Boston in 1959: the Bosox won 44 of 80 games under him, improving from eighth to fifth place, and finally broke the color line with the promotion of Pumpsie Green from the minor leagues. But the Red Sox, facing the end of Ted Williams' great career in , were a team in disarray. Composed of aging veterans and mostly unpromising youngsters‚Äîand stunned by the sudden retirement, in his prime, of right fielder and Most Valuable Player Jackie Jensen‚Äîthe 1960 Red Sox fell into the American League basement after losing 27 of their first 42 games. Jurges, an intense competitor, suffered in an alien organization composed largely of cronies of owner Yawkey. The Red Sox front office was about to undergo a massive shakeup, with Harris, Jurges' patron, on his way out the door. On June 8, Jurges left the team, citing illness. (Some Boston baseball writers believed that he suffered from nervous exhaustion.Hirshberg, Al, What's the Matter With the Red Sox. New York: Dodd, Mead & Co., 1973) He was fired two days later, and, after bench coach Del Baker handled the team for five days, Higgins returned to the manager's post he had lost 11 months before. Jurges never managed again in baseball (his final record was 59 wins, 63 losses ‚Äî .484) but he scouted for six teams before his final retirement: the Baltimore Orioles, New York Mets, Houston Colt .45s/Astros, the expansion Washington Senators and its successor, the Texas Rangers, the Seattle Mariners and the Cubs. He died at age 88 in Clearwater, Florida.

He is the author of several famous novels but it is particularly in the field of poetry that he proved his mastery of Esperanto.  Early life  Baghy was born into a theatrical family -- his father was an actor, and his mother a stage prompter. He began learning Esperanto in 1911. He started work as an actor and theatre manager, but the First World War intervened and took him out of his home country for six years. He was captured and made a prisoner of war in Siberia. It was during this time that he began to work for the Esperanto movement, writing poetry and teaching the language to his fellow inmates.  Literary works  Books = Baghy wrote two books on the subject of captivity in Siberia: Viktimoj (Victims, 1925), and Sur Sanga Tero (On Bloody Soil, 1933), republished together as a single volume in 1971. His satirical novel Hura! (Hooray!, 1930) was somewhat less of a success. Its sequel Insulo de Espero (Island of Hope) was lost during the war. His most famous novel Printempo en A≈≠tuno (Spring in Autumn) was written in 1931. = Poetry = It is however for his poetry that Baghy is best known. His first poems were written during his time of captivity in Siberia. Hitherto those poets, such as Zamenhof, who had written in Esperanto were limited by the still young language, and apart from Antoni Grabowski, no poet had managed to make a mark on the language. Baghy's most significant collections of poems was his first: Preter la Vivo (Beyond Life, published in 1922). Among his more notable collection of poems are Pilgrimo (Pilgrim, 1926) and Vagabondo Kantas (The Vagabond Sings, 1933). In 1966 he produced ƒàielarko (Rainbow), retelling in verse folk tales from twelve different nations. His last collection of poems, A≈≠tunaj folioj (Autumn leaves), was published posthumously in 1970.  Esperanto movement  Returning to Hungary after the war, he became one of the principal teachers of the Esperanto movement, organising newsgroups and literary evenings. In addition to working in his native Hungary, he organised courses in countries such as Estonia, Latvia, the Netherlands and France. He was one of the principal writers for the Esperanto literary review Literatura Mondo until 1933. His works reflect a slogan of his: Amo kreas pacon, Paco konservas homecon, Homeco estas plej alta idealismo. (Love creates peace, Peace preserves humanity, Humanity is the highest ideal.) Several of his works were granted awards by the Academy of Esperanto and a number of his novels have been translated into several languages.  Bibliography  *M. Boulton, Poeto fajrakora.

Other common names include chepil, chepilin, chipilin and longbeak rattlebox. Description Chipil√≠n leaves are a common leafy vegetable in the local cuisines of southern Mexico, including Chiapas, Oaxaca, and Tabasco, and Central America, especially El Salvador and Guatemala. The leaves are high in iron, calcium, magnesium, and beta carotene. They can be boiled and served green, dried and used as an herb, or added to tamale doughs for color and flavor. When the pods of the plant dry, they dehisce (split open), spreading the seeds over a wide area. That, combined with the fact that the plant is not eaten by animals, has given chipil√≠n the reputation of an invasive plant. In the continental United States, chipil√≠n is characterized as a noxious weed, perhaps because other members of the genus Crotalaria are toxic to cattle. The importation of chipil√≠n seeds or plants is banned in Australia. Introduced populations exist on the island of Maui in Hawaii.

By 1921, Morgan's interest in women's employment and experience founding the Colony Club evolved into the American Woman's Association, where a working woman \\"with ambition, pluck and energy, which will push her up and up in her profession\\" could network and develop leadership skills. Morgan was quoted saying that although no women of the time were equipped to head a large corporation, \\"in time there will be plenty of such women -- it requires only evolution.\\" By 1930 the American Woman's Association had constructed a large building of its own in New York City, now the Hudson Hotel.

His uncle Anselm preceded him as bishop of Lucca before being elected to the papacy as Pope Alexander II; owing to this, he is sometimes distinguished as or Life Born in Mantua, and was educated there in grammar and dialectic.Fr. Alban Butler. \\"Saint Anselm, Bishop of Lucca, Confessor\\". Lives of the Fathers, Martyrs, and Principal Saints, 1866. CatholicSaints.Info. 17 March 2013. Web. Anselm was a nephew of Anselm of Lucca the Elder, who became Pope Alexander II in 1061 and who designated Anselm to succeed him in his former position as Bishop of Lucca (1071) and sent him to Germany advising him to take investiture from Emperor Henry IV. Alexander II, may have elevated him to the cardinalate ca. 1062.This is according to Salvador Miranda.The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church Other sources consulted do not mention his promotion to the cardinalate. He is not listed among the cardinals of the 11th century in the modern printed prosopographies of the cardinals of that period (R. H√ºls, Kardin√§le, Klerus und Kirchen Roms: 1049‚Äì1130, T√ºbingen 1977; H.W. Klewitz, Reformpapsttum und Kardinalkolleg, Darmstadt 1957; K. Ganzer, Die entwicklung des ausw√§rtigen Kardinalats im hohen Mittelater, T√ºbingen 1963) Anselm went to Germany, but was loath to receive the insignia of spiritual power from a temporal ruler and returned without investiture. In 1073, Pope Gregory VII, again appointed Anselm Bishop of Lucca, but advised him not to accept investiture from Henry IV. For some reason, Anselm did so this time, but soon felt such remorse that he resigned his bishopric, and entered the Benedictine Order at Padilirone, a Cluniac monastery near Mantua.Ott, Michael. \\"St. Anselm of Lucca, the Younger.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 10 Mar. 2015 Gregory VII ordered him to return to Lucca, and he reluctantly obeyed, but continued to lead the life of a monk. In the years 1077‚Äì79, he accepted the transfer of several castles from Countess Matilda, in preparation for Henry's expected campaign, which was carried out in 1081‚Äì84. Meanwhile, he attempted to impose stricter monastic discipline upon the canons of his cathedral. Most of the canons refused to submit to the new regulations. Anselm was expelled from Lucca around 1080,Monks of Ramsgate. \\"Anselm of Lucca\\". Book of Saints, 1921. CatholicSaints.Info. 21 July 2012 with the help of Emperor Henry and Guibert, Antipope Clement III, after the defeat of the papal defender, the Countess Matilda of Tuscany at the Battle of Volta Mantovana (October 1080). Anselm fled first to the shelter of Moriana, an episcopal stronghold only a few miles up the Arno from Lucca‚Äî accompanied by Bardo, a priest who later wrote his vita‚Äîthen retired to Canossa as spiritual guide to Countess Matilda. Bishop Benzo of Alba, Henry IV's fiercely partisan supporter, tells how Matilda and Anselm stripped the monasteries to send gold and silver to Gregory in Rome. Because through his prayers was obtained the rout of the enemies of Gregory VII, he is represented before an army in confusion.\\"Saint Anselm of Lucca\\". New Catholic Dictionary. CatholicSaints.Info. 30 July 2012 Some time later Pope Victor III made him papal legate to Lombardy, with authorization to rule over all the dioceses which had been left without bishops due to the conflict between pope and emperor. Anselm was well versed in scripture and wrote some important works attacking lay investiture and defending Pope Gregory against Antipope Clement III and Emperor Henry IV. He spent his last years assembling a collection of ecclesiastical law canons in 13 books, which formed the earliest of the collections of canons (Collectio canonum) supporting the Gregorian reforms, which afterwards were incorporated into the well-known Decretum of the jurist Gratian. The Collectio canonum most notably revived the Justinian‚Äôs Novellae, which set the basis for Roman law in the middle ages. Anselm died in Mantua on March 18, 1086, and is regarded as the patron saint of that city. Two biographies were written about the bishop-saint shortly after his death: Pseudo-Bardone‚Äôs Vita Anselmi episcopi Lucensis and Bishop Rangerius of Lucca‚Äôs, Vita metrica of S. Anselmi lucensis episcopi. Anselm was canonized by Pope Victor III in 1087.

The store was located at 118 Sparks Street in a 1909 building designed by C.P. Meredith, and for years used the slogan \\"Ottawa's Smart Store\\". Murphy-Gamble's fifth floor restaurant was known as the Rideau Room. Sparks Street was home to many of Ottawa's department stores during the first half of the 20th century, including Murphy-Gamble, C. Ross and Bryson-Graham. Ogilvy's, Freimans and Caplan's were located further east, on Rideau Street. The success of local department stores in Ottawa discouraged the entry of most national chains into the National Capital Region until the 1950s. Murphy-Gamble was purchased by Simpson's in 1971, and the store continued to operate under the Simpson's banner until 1983. The building is now occupied by a branch of Scotiabank. With the closing of the Zellers store in 2013, and the closure of Holt Renfrew at 240 Sparks Street in 2014, there are now no department stores left in operation on Sparks Street.

The township probably dates from the Anglo-Saxon times, and was first recorded as Halcton or Halghton in the thirteenth century. In Saxon, Haughton means 'settlement' (ton) on 'low-lying land' (Haugh), and probably refers to the ancient township's location in the Tame Valley. Township boundaries The ancient boundaries of Haughton run along the modern day Ashton Road from the Audenshaw boundary then along Howard Lane, adjacent to the M67 motorway, along the back of Osborne Road, along the boundary of Bentley Road and Stockport Road Playing fields, along Chapelfield Road, the rear of Mount Pleasant Road, along Stockport Road to Three Lanes End, along Two Trees Lane to the Cock Inn and then following a (now culverted) stream to the River Tame, which then forms the eastern boundaries with Bredbury and Woodley and Hyde. Local government history Haughton adopted the Local Government Act in 1877, forming the Haughton Local Board of Health. in 1884 this was amalgamated with the Denton Local Board, to form the Denton and Haughton Local Board of Health. This in turn became the Denton Urban District Council in 1894. In 1974, Denton Urban District Council became part of the new Metropolitan Borough of Tameside. The Haughton coat of arms was originally three silver bars on a black shield. These elements were incorporated on the right hand side of the Denton UDC armorial shield, along with the two red bars on a white background on the left hand side of the shield, and the three cinquefoils, originating from the Denton arms. The new Denton shield is described as 'Denton impaling Haughton'. Haughton's industrial past is very similar to that of Denton with both agriculture, mining and Hatting forming the township's main industries. Today, Haughton is predominantly a residential township. Haughton today St Anne's Church The name Haughton survives in Haughton Green, the main centre of the old township, and now a large housing estate surrounding the ancient village core; Haughton Dale, a hamlet at the bottom of Meadow Lane, and Haughton itself, which is the area around St. Anne's Church (Church of England) and Hyde Road. Clues to the township's past also exist in the names of Haughton Street (in Audenshaw on the boundary with Haughton) and Haughton Hall Road, where Haughton Hall farm was located until the 1940s. There is also an ancient boundary marker on Broomstair bridge, across Hyde Road at the River Tame, marking the old boundary between Hyde and Haughton. Haughton's modern day population is around 11,000. Around half of Denton North East Ward and about two-thirds of Denton South Ward constitute the old township. Haughton's Councillors (at 2012) are: Vincent Ricci, Denise Ward and Allison Gwynne (Denton North East) and Margaret Downs, Mike Fowler and Claire Francis (Denton South). Andrew Gwynne is Haughton's Member of Parliament.

He threw left-handed, and batted right-handed. Early life Short was born in Milford, Delaware on September 19, 1937. He was the son of Issac Short, a Delaware judge who had attended the University of Pennsylvania. He graduated high school from the Bordentown Military Institute. Baseball career Short made his first appearance on the mound on April 19, 1959 against the Cincinnati Reds, appearing in the 2nd inning to replace Jim Owens. He allowed five runs on four hits while striking out three and walking three in 3.2 innings. Short, circa 1963 Short was considered a top pitcher from 1964 through 1968 with the Phillies. He was 17‚Äì9 in 1964, with a 2.20 ERA in 220 innings pitched. It was his career-best ERA and was third in the league behind only Sandy Koufax (1.74) and Don Drysdale (2.18). Teammate Jim Bunning was 5th that season with a 2.63 ERA. Juan Marichal finished 4th (2.48). That year, however, the Phillies and Short suffered a historic collapse in the pennant race. After leading by six and a half games with 12 to go, manager Gene Mauch decided to start his two aces, Bunning and Short, for eight of the last 12 games. Short pitched respectably despite the heavy workload, giving up only six earned runs in 18 innings over his final three starts. But weak hitting, ineffective relief pitching and poor defense (the team committed 17 errors in a 10-game losing streak) doomed Philadelphia. The Phillies lost three games in a row to the hot St. Louis Cardinals, who won the NL race by 1 game and defeated the New York Yankees in the 1964 World Series. On October 2, 1965, Short threw 15 shutout innings at Shea Stadium, striking out 18 Mets only to receive a no-decision. The game would end in a scoreless tie after 18 innings. Short ended up winning 55 games from 1964 through 1966, topping off with a 20‚Äì10 record in 1966. A back injury during the 1969 season would curtail his season while also proving to hurt his career. His final appearance on the mound was on September 18, 1973 against the Cleveland Indians. He entered in relief of Jim Colborn in the ninth inning, trying to preserve a 5-4 lead with a runner on second base. Facing John Ellis, Short allowed a home run as the Indians won the game 6-5. In 15 seasons, Short finished with a 135‚Äì132 record, just over a .500 winning percentage. He had a career ERA of 3.43 and 1629 career strikeouts in 501 games (308 starts). He allowed 886 earned runs in 2325 innings pitched. Short ranks 4th among Phillies pitchers all time in wins (132), 5th in games appeared in (459), 3rd in games started (301), 19th in complete games (88), 4th in shutouts (24), 4th in innings pitched (2253), and 4th in strikeouts (1585). After baseball In 1979, Short was inducted into the Delaware Sports Museum and Hall of Fame. Between 1985 and 1988, Short taught young pitchers at Suburban Baseball Camp, which was held at Barness Park in Warrington, Pennsylvania. He suffered from diabetes in his later years, along with trying to support his three sons. While working for a Wilmington insurance agency in October 1988, he suffered a ruptured brain aneurysm, lapsing into a coma. He died on August 1, 1991 in a convalescent home, having never regained consciousness. He was posthumously named to the Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame the following year. In 2016 Short was one of 16 new members inducted to the Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame.

Features The natural amphitheater created by Slayter Hill can hold 20,000 people. Architect Joseph Baker used Stonehenge in England as a basis for the concept of the Slayter Center. The 200-ton concrete roof is suspended by stainless steel cables from a tall steel tripod and the stage can seat an orchestra of more than a hundred. Below the stage are a rehearsal room, dressing rooms and storage facilities. Slayter Center is home to the Purdue Jazz Bands. Before 2013, on the morning of home football games, Slayter Center became the site of a pep rally known as \\"Thrill on the Hill.\\" The Purdue All-American Marching Band performed upbeat tunes showcasing music from their halftime show for the day, plus other selections from the season's repertoire. Fans could meet and get autographs from the Purdue Cheerleaders and mascot Purdue Pete, or check out the Boilermaker Special before heading to Ross‚ÄìAde Stadium with the band for the pre-game. Since the 2013-2014 season, the All-American Marching Band has performed their \\"211 Session,\\" or pre-game pep rally, at nearby Mackey Arena Mackey Arena, with Slayter Center now being the performance site for a post-game concert. Starting in 2018, All-American has returned to Slayter Center for \\"Thrill on the Hill,\\" with the post-game concert taking place on the field at Ross-Ade Stadium. During the school year, movies are projected onto a large, inflatable screen in front of the amphitheater. It is also home to several free concerts throughout the year.

The name Chilliwack comes from the Halkomelem word Tcil'Qe'uk, meaning \\"valley of many streams\\". Course Originating as the Chilliwack River in Washington's North Cascades National Park, the river begins at Hannegan Pass and flows north across the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border and into Chilliwack Lake. The river flows through Hells Gorge, a deep, dangerous-to- access gorge just below the river's headwaters that is home of a waterfall that the river drops over.Waterfalls of the Northwest: Chilliwack Falls The river picks up the Little Chilliwack River before crossing the border. There is a large sandy beach located where the river enters the lake, a popular recreational area among locals. The river exits the north end of the lake and flows generally west via the Chilliwack River Valley to emerge on the Fraser Lowland on the south side of the City of Chilliwack. At Vedder Crossing, the river is joined by the Sweltzer River before flowing under a bridge at which its name changes to the Vedder River, after which is flows west and north to join the Sumas River just before that river's confluence with the Fraser River at the northeast end of Sumas Mountain. The river crosses the Fraser floodplain from Vedder Crossing to its confluence with the Sumas via the Vedder Canal, which prevents the river's considerable spring freshet from flooding the surrounding farmlands and towns, and which is part of the drainage system that turned Sumas Lake into Sumas Prairie. Downstream from the Vedder Crossing Bridge, the Vedder River marks the boundary between Yarrow to the south and Greendale to the north (both are separate semi-rural communities that are now part of the City of Chilliwack). History The Vedder River circa 1910 Historically the Chilliwack River flowed north from Vedder Crossing, over a broad alluvial fan to the Fraser River. In 1875 heavy rains caused a logjam that diverted the river into two small streams, called Vedder Creek and Luckakuk Creek. This caused hardship for the area's farmers. In 1882 a new logjam was deliberately created which caused the waters of several streams to shift course toward the west, flowing into the now-drained Sumas Lake. A freshet in 1894 caused the new course to become permanent.River Diversion, Chilliwack Museum and Archives In the early 20th century the diverted river was diked and channelized. Today the Chilliwack River changes into the Vedder River at Vedder Crossing, and then becomes the Vedder Canal farther downstream. online at Google Books The Vedder Canal was created in the 1920s as part of the effort to drain Sumas Lake.Draining the Lake, Chilliwack Museum and Archives The former course of the Chilliwack River below Vedder Crossing is now known as Chilliwack Creek, which flows north to the Fraser River. The Chilliwack River was heavily used by the Northwest Boundary Survey of 1857-1862 as a means of accessing the 49th parallel north in order to survey and map the border between American and British-Canadian sovereignty. A number of the Chilliwack's tributaries cross the 49th parallel, including Liumchen Creek, Tamihi Creek, Damfino Creek, Slesse Creek, Nesakwatch Creek, and, from Chilliwack Lake, Klahailhu Creek and Depot Creek. Both American and British surveying parties established base camps on Chilliwack Lake from which they sent field parties through the Chilliwack drainage and east to the Skagit River drainage. In addition, the Whatcom Trail followed much of the Chilliwack River's course. Recreation Vedder River Campground The Vedder River Campground, operated by The Fraser Valley Regional District, is open from April 1 to October 31. The Vedder-Chilliwack River is well known for its runs of chinook, coho, chum, pink and sockeye salmon in the fall, along with winter and spring steelhead fishing. The 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games' rowing events were held on the Vedder Canal. Canadians Bobby Williams in single sculls, and Donald Guest & Lawrence Stephan in double sculls won bronze medals. Canada won the gold medal in eights rowing.

Proponents of drug policy reform believe that prohibition of drugs‚Äîsuch as cannabis, opioids, cocaine, amphetamines and hallucinogens‚Äîhas been ineffectual and counterproductive. They argue that, rather than using laws and enforcement as the primary means to responding to substance use, governments and citizens would be better served by reducing harm and regulating the production, marketing, and distribution of currently illegal drugs in a manner similar to (or some would say better than) how alcohol and tobacco are regulated. Proponents of drug law reform argue that relative harm should be taken into account in the regulation of controlled substances. Addictive or dependency-forming substances such as alcohol, tobacco and caffeine have been a traditional part of Western culture for centuries and remain legal, though it is now established that alcohol and tobacco are potentially more harmful than some substances subsequently classified under Schedule I.World health report 2002: reducing risks, promoting healthy lifeReport by the Dutch Government Stating Psilocybin's Relative Harmlessness The U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, a branch of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, rated the hallucinogen psilocybin (Schedule I) less toxic than aspirin. The Dutch government found this also to be true. The addictive properties of the drug nicotine in tobacco are often compared with heroin or cocaine,American Heart Association and Nicotine addiction. but tobacco is legal, even though the World Health Organization (WHO) in the 2002 World Health Report estimates that in developed countries, 26% of male deaths and 9% of female deaths can be attributed to tobacco smoking. According to the American Heart Association, \\"Nicotine addiction has historically been one of the hardest addictions to break.\\" The pharmacologic and behavioral characteristics that determine tobacco addiction are similar to those that determine addiction to drugs such as heroin and cocaine. History of drug policy reform Initial attempts to change the punitive drug laws which were introduced all over the world from the late 1800s onwards were primarily based around recreational use. Timothy Leary was one of the most prominent campaigners for the legal and recreational use of LSD. In 1967, a \\"Legalise pot\\" rally was held in Britain. However, as death toll from the drug war rose, other organisations began to form to campaign on a more political and humanitarian basis. Drug Policy Foundation formed in America and Release, a charity which gives free legal advice to drugs users and currently campaigns for drug decriminalization, also incorporated in the 1970s. Today, the focus of the world's drug policy reform organisations is on the promotion of harm reduction in the Western World, and attempting to prevent the catastrophic loss of human life in developing countries where much of the world's supply of heroin, cocaine, and marijuana are produced. Drug policy reform advocates point to failed efforts such as the Mexican Drug War, which according to some observers has claimed as many as 80,000 lives, as signs that a new approach to drug policy is needed. In 2014 within the European Union, a European Citizens' Initiative called Weed like to talk was launched with the aim of starting a debate in Europe about the legalization of the production, sale and use of marijuana in the European Union and finding a common policy for all EU member states. As of June 30, 2014, the initiative has collected 100,000 signatures from citizens in European member states. Should they reach 1 million signatures, from nationals of at least one quarter of the member states, the European Commission will be required to initiate a legislative proposal and a debate on the issue. Proposed alternativesHarm reduction= Harm reduction refers to a range of public health policies designed to reduce the harmful consequences associated with recreational drug use and other high risk activities. Harm reduction is put forward as a useful perspective alongside the more conventional approaches of demand and supply reduction. Many advocates argue that prohibitionist laws criminalize people for suffering from a disease and cause harm, for example by obliging drug addicts to obtain drugs of unknown purity from unreliable criminal sources at high prices, increasing the risk of overdose and death. Its critics are concerned that tolerating risky or illegal behaviour sends a message to the community that these behaviours are acceptable. =Decriminalization= Drug decriminalization calls for reduced control and penalties compared to existing laws. Proponents of drug decriminalization generally support the use of fines or other punishments to replace prison terms, and often propose systems whereby illegal drug users who are caught would be fined, but would not receive a permanent criminal record as a result. A central feature of drug decriminalization is the concept of harm reduction. Drug decriminalization is in some ways an intermediate between prohibition and legalization, and has been criticized as being \\"the worst of both worlds\\", in that drug sales would still be illegal, thus perpetuating the problems associated with leaving production and distribution of drugs to the criminal underworld, while also failing to discourage illegal drug use by removing the criminal penalties that might otherwise cause some people to choose not to use drugs. Portugal was the first country in the world that has decriminalized the use of all drugs. This generally means anyone caught with any type of drug, if it classifies as being for personal consumption rather than sale, will not be imprisoned. However, Mexico City has decriminalized certain drugs and Greece has just announced that it is going to do so. Spain has also followed the Portugal model. Italy after waiting 10 years to see the result of the Portugal model, which Portugal deemed a success, has since recently followed suit. In May 2014, the Criminal Chamber of the Italian Supreme Court upheld a previous decision in 2013 by Italy's Constitutional Court, to reduce the penalties for the convictions for sale of soft drugs. Some other countries have virtual decriminalization for marijuana only, in three US states, Colorado, Washington, and Oregon, one Australian state (SA) and in the Netherlands there are legal marijuana cafes. In the Netherlands these cafes are called \\"coffee shops\\" =Legalization= Drug legalization calls for the end of government-enforced prohibition on the distribution or sale and personal use of specified (or all) currently banned drugs. Proposed ideas range from full legalization which would completely remove all forms of government control, to various forms of regulated legalization, where drugs would be legally available, but under a system of government control which might mean for instance:After the War on Drugs: Blueprint for Regulation, Transform Drug Policy Foundation (12 Nov 2009) * mandated labels with dosage and medical warnings, * restrictions on advertising, * age limitations, * restrictions on amount purchased at one time, * requirements on the form in which certain drugs would be supplied, * ban on sale to intoxicated persons, * special user licenses to purchase particular drugs. The regulated legalization system would probably have a range of restrictions for different drugs, depending on their perceived risk, so while some drugs would be sold over the counter in pharmacies or other licensed establishments, drugs with greater risks of harm might only be available for sale on licensed premises where use could be monitored and emergency medical care made available. Examples of drugs with different levels of regulated distribution in most countries include: caffeine (coffee, tea), nicotine (tobacco),Tobacco regulation: Saving livings vs personal freedom, Transform Drug Policy Foundation (3 Feb 2010) ethyl alcohol (beer, wine, spirits), and antibiotics. Full legalization is often proposed by groups such as libertarians who object to drug laws on moral grounds, while regulated legalization is suggested by groups such as Law Enforcement Against Prohibition who object to the drug laws on the grounds that they fail to achieve their stated aims and instead greatly worsen the problems associated with use of prohibited drugs, but who acknowledge that there are harms associated with currently prohibited drugs which need to be minimized. Not all proponents of drug re-legalization necessarily share a common ethical framework, and people may adopt this viewpoint for a variety of reasons. In particular, favoring drug re-legalization does not imply approval of drug use. Decriminalization and legalisation is also supported by rationalists, who also support free adult access to all plants that grow in the earth as an essential human right, currently being denied by most governments.Reformers and not 'pro-drug' Mr Costa, Transform Drug Policy Foundation (7 Dec 2009) Groups advocating change The Senlis Council, a European development and policy thinktank, has, since its conception in 2002, advocated that drug addiction should be viewed as a public health issue rather than a purely criminal matter. The group does not support the decriminalisation of illegal drugs. Since 2003, the Council has called for the licensing of poppy cultivation in Afghanistan in order to manufacture poppy- based medicines, such as morphine and codeine, and to combat poverty in rural communities, breaking ties with the illicit drugs trade. The Senlis Council outlined proposals for the implementation of a village based poppy for medicine project and calls for a pilot project for Afghan morphine at the next planting season.\\"Poppy for Medicine \\" (June 2007) Organisations involved in lobbying, research and advocacyCanada= * Le Dain Commission of Inquiry into the Non-Medical Use of Drugs =Europe= * Beckley Foundation * European Coalition for Just and Effective Drug Policies (ENCOD) (Branches in Austria, Germany and Norway) * Transform Drug Policy Foundation * Drug Equality Alliance (DEA) * Release (agency) (United Kingdom) * Re:Vision Drug Policy Network Re:Vision Drug Policy Network (United Kingdom) * Students for Sensible Drug Policy UK (United Kingdom) * Regulaci√≥n Responsable (Spain) =Australia= *Drug Policy AustraliaDrug Policy Australia *Network Against Prohibition =New Zealand= *The Helen Clark Foundation *The STAR TrustThe STAR Trust =United States= * American Civil Liberties UnionAmerican Civil Liberties Union Drug Law Reform Accessed 2010-02-15 * Americans for Safe Access * Drug Policy Alliance * High Times * High Times Freedom Fighters * Law Enforcement Against ProhibitionLEAP * Lindesmith Center * Marijuana Policy Project * MASS CANN/NORML * Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) * National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana LawsNORML * Students for Sensible Drug Policy * Veterans for Medical Marijuana Access * November Coalition (United States) * Women Grow Political parties with drug law reform policiesAustralia= * Australian Greens * Drug Law Reform Australia * Reason Party (Australia) * Help End Marijuana Prohibition (HEMP) Party * Legalise Cannabis Queensland =Canada= * Liberal Party of Canada * New Democratic Party of Canada =Netherlands= * GroenLinks =New Zealand= * Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand =United Kingdom= * Green Party of England and Wales * Liberal Democrats =International= * Pirate Party See also * Arguments for and against drug prohibition * Cannabis Social Club * Cognitive liberty * Decriminalization * Drug liberalization * Drug prohibition law * Gateway drug theory * Harm reduction * Legalization * Psilocybin decriminalization in the United States * Responsible drug use * School district drug policies * Students for Sensible Drug Policy * Supervised injection site * Transform Drug Policy Foundation * War on drugs ReferencesExternal links * Schaffer Library of Drug Policy Category:Drug control law ","title":"Drug policy reform"},{"id":"2751674","text":"The Galesburg Railroad Museum is a railroad museum in Galesburg, Illinois, United States.

Beasley, Doctor Robert Crants and T. Don Hutto. Beasley served as the chairman of the Tennessee Republican Party; Crants was the chief financial officer of a real estate company in Nashville; Hutto was the president-elect of the American Correctional Association. A founding member of its board of directors was Maurice Sigler, the former chairman of the United States Board of Parole. The initial investment came from Jack C. Massey, co-founder of the Hospital Corporation of America.Harmon L. Wray, Jr., \\"Cells for Sale\\" , Southern Changes: The Journal of the Southern Regional Council, Volume 8, Number 3, 1989 An early investor prior to the IPO was Vanderbilt University, where Beasley had completed his law degree. Additionally, the Tennessee Valley Authority was another early financial backer. According to a 2013 CCA video, Hutto and Beasley were the chief founders. Hutto had years of experience in corrections and was president-elect of the American Correctional Association. The two men met with representatives of the Federal Bureau of Prisons and Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS, now ICE), which operated under U.S. Department of Justice from 1933 to 2003, to discuss a potential joint venture for a facility to detain undocumented immigrants in Texas. CCA was awarded a contract in late 1983 by the U.S. Department of Justice for the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (formerly Immigration and Naturalization Service). This was the \\"first contract ever to design, build, finance and operate a secure correctional facility.\\" This is considered to have marked the beginning of the private prison industry. CCA had to have the facilities ready by early January 1984, ninety days from the signing of the contract. Hutto and Beasley flew to Houston and after several days, negotiated a deal with the owner of Olympic Motel‚Äîa \\"pair of nondescript two-story buildings\\" on \\"I-45 North between Tidwell and Parker\\"‚Äîto hire their family and friends to staff the re-purposed motel for four months as a detention facility. On Super Bowl Sunday at the end of January, Hutto personally processed the first 87 undocumented immigrants at this facility, and CCA received its first payment. The company opened its first facility, the Houston Processing Center, in 1984. The Houston Detention Center was built to house individuals awaiting a decision on immigration cases or repatriation. In 1984, CCA also took over the operations of the Tall Trees non-secure juvenile facility, for the Juvenile Court of Memphis and Shelby County. Two years later, CCA built the 200-bed Shelby Training Center in Memphis to house juvenile male offenders. In 1989, it opened the New Mexico Women's Correctional Facility in Grants, New Mexico; it had constructed this facility of 204 beds.New Mexico Women's Correctional Facility, Grants, Corrections, State of New Mexico In the 1980s, CCA officials met with representatives of the Mitterrand administration in France. They did not win any contracts there for CCA prisons. In 1990, CCA opened the first medium- security privately operated prison, the state-owned Winn Correctional Center, in Winn Parish, Louisiana.Louisiana Department of Corrections It opened the Leavenworth Detention Center, operated for the U.S. Marshals Service, in 1992.

In 2014, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began an investigation into CCA management of the ICC to ascertain whether any Federal statutes were violated because of the understaffing of the facility and what was found to be falsification of staffing records.Rebecca Boone (March 7, 2014).

The Washington Post. August 14, 2016. CCA was renamed CoreCivic in October 2016. Overview Founded in 1983, Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) owns or operates jails and prisons on contract with federal, state and local governments. CCA designs, builds, manages and operates correctional facilities and detention centers for the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the United States Marshals Service, as well as state and county facilities across the United States. CCA houses approximately 90,000 offenders and detainees in its more than 60 facilities; it employs more than 17,000 persons nationwide. Federal contracts for correctional and detention facilities generated up to 51% of its revenues in 2015. It operated 22 federal facilities with the capacity for 25,851 prisoners. The American Correctional Association (ACA) has accredited 90% of CCA's facilities.CCA Facilities Receive High Marks from American Correctional Association, 2011 CCA press release. Retrieved February 10, 2014.

In addition to the reentry and rehabilitation programs, prisons often offer inmates recreational and optional faith-based opportunities. The latter is considered an integral part of inmate rehabilitation. CCA says it offers basic adult education, post-secondary education, GRE preparation, and testing and literacy programs to all inmates. The Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics reported in 2008 that 40% of privately run facilities did not offer such programming to inmates. According to national research, providing inmates with education and vocational programs can reduce the likelihood that offenders will commit new offenses upon release and return to prison. In 1993, CCA launched the LifeLine substance abuse training program at the Metro-Davidson County Detention Facility in Nashville, Tennessee. In the early 21st century, CCA offers the program in 23 of its 60 facilities.\\"Lifeline graduates first class\\", News Herald =Occupancy and profitability= In a 1990s report, Prudential Securities was bullish on CCA but noted, \\"It takes time to bring inmate population levels up to where they cover costs. Low occupancy is a drag on profits... company earnings would be strong if CCA succeeded in ramp(ing) up population levels in its new facilities at an acceptable rate\\". In 2011, responding to an initiative from the State of Ohio to reduce \\"overhead costs by saving $13 million annually while adding 700 beds to house inmates in the overcrowded system,\\" Corrections Corporation of America agreed to buy the Lake Erie Correctional Institution for $72.7 million. This is a change in company policy, as previously CCA had always constructed its own prisons. The purchase was contingent on the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction agreeing to a high level of occupancy under the contract.\\"Ohio State Prison System Sales\\", Cleveland, September 2011. The State failed to find buyers for many other prisons which it offered for sale. This was considered good news by the Ohio Civil Service Employees Association, the union for prison guards. In 2012, CCA sent a letter to prison officials in 48 states, offering to buy prisons from these states in exchange for a 20-year management contract with a guaranteed occupancy rate of 90%. Many community organizations have criticized the proposals, arguing that the contractual obligations of states to fill the prisons to 90% occupancy are poor public policy, creating an incentive to criminalize behavior and lengthen sentences in order to keep the prisons filled. They believe that these contractual clauses end up costing taxpayers more than state-run prisons would and add to over-incarceration. =Employment issues= In 2002 CCA agreed to pay more than $152,000 in back wages to 96 Oklahoma women denied employment because of gender discrimination. A U.S. Department of Labor audit showed women applicants, who were equally or better qualified than men hired, were rejected.

Immigrant detention facilities The prison industry declined in the late 20th century, as the crime rate was decreasing nationally and privatization was under attack by critics and legislators. There had been widespread reports of escapes, inmate violence, and deplorable conditions in such private facilities. Speculative prison building, sometimes supported by small municipalities hoping to increase local employment, had increased competition and the pressure to keep prisons filled. The Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), which became CoreCivic in October 2017, as well as the industry as a whole, rebounded in the early 2000s. This followed a massive increase in detentions of undocumented immigrants by the federal government in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, which created a new market for its facilities. From 2001 to 2011, CCA's revenue increased 88 percent, and it received at least $1 billion in revenue for each of the eight years from 2003 to 2011. In 2012, CCA derived 30 percent of its revenue from federal contracts. In 2012 some $546 million for CCA came from federal contracts with the Bureau of Prisons and the U.S. Marshals Service. Although they have denied lobbying, private prison corporations specifically target Republican legislators over \\"immigration reform\\".

Because the matter was under litigation, the company had said publicly that the release of the video is \\"an unnecessary security risk to our staff, the inmates entrusted to our care and ultimately to the public.\\" CCA said it was cooperating with investigators. In March 2010, the ACLU filed suit in federal court against CCA in Idaho, alleging that guards were not protecting inmates from other violent inmates.Rebecca Boone, \\"ACLU suing Corrections Corp. of America\\", Associated Press, in Corrections One, March 11, 2010 In February 2014, the federal judge hearing the case awarded $349,000 in attorney fees to the ACLU for its costs in bringing the action.'Federal judge orders CCA to pay attorney fees to ACLU', Idaho Press-Tribune, February 22, 2014. Retrieved February 23, 2014. A settlement was reached to correct conditions at the prisons run by CCA. In November 2012, eight inmates filed a federal lawsuit in Idaho alleging that CCA prison officials partially ceded control of the Idaho Correctional Center to gang leaders. The lawsuit cited Idaho Department of Correction claimed CCA used gang members of the Aryan Knights and the Severely Violent Criminals to manage the institution. Investigators reported IDOC was aware the prison housed members of the same gangs together in some cell blocks to reduce violent clashes. In September 2013, a federal judge held CCA in contempt of court for persistently understaffing the Idaho Correctional Center in direct violation of a legal settlement. In October 2013, CCA was discouraged from bidding on a new contract to operate the Idaho Correctional Center. The state took back control and operations of its prison on July 1, 2014. Also in 2012, former and current employees in Lieutenant positions, who were categorized as \\"Salary Employees,\\" filed lawsuits arguing that their daily duties and work hours were not that of a salary employee. They worked considerable overtime. Specifically, they sued CCA because their actual duties were not those of typical salaried employees in criminal justice, nor did they have the authority to \\"Hire and Fire\\" as a salaried employee should. CCA lost the lawsuit and paid a settlement of hundreds of thousands of dollars to its current and former Lieutenants. After losing the suit, CCA continued to classify their Lieutenants as salaried employees, saying, \\"It's cheaper to pay out law suits every couple years than it is to pay them for the (overtime) hours they actually work.\\" =Co- operation with local law enforcement in a school drug sweep= In 2012, CCA conducted a drug sweep of Vista Grande High School in Casa Grande, Arizona in concert with local law enforcement. Caroline Isaacs, the program director of the Tucson office of the American Friends Service Committee said, \\"It is chilling to think that any school official would be willing to put vulnerable students at risk this way.\\" =2012 fatal prison riot in Mississippi facility= In May 2012 a riot at CCA-operated Adams County Correctional Facility in Natchez, Mississippi resulted in the death of a Corrections Officer and injury to sixteen staff members and three prisoners. Twenty-five employees were held hostage during the disturbance. It was quelled by facility staff with assistance from the Mississippi Highway Patrol and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. According to a company statement, the fatality was the second time an employee had \\"lost his life to inmate assault.\\" =Prison incidents and fatalities in Oklahoma= In 2015 violence increased at Cimarron Correctional Facility in Cushing, Oklahoma, including a riot involving 200‚Äì300 prisoners in June 2015 that resulted in eleven inmates being hospitalized. On September 13, 2015, a fight between white gangs broke out that resulted in the deaths of four inmates and hospitalization of four others because of their injuries. It was the deadliest event in Oklahoma corrections' history. CCA declined multiple requests for a recorded interview after the Cimmaron events. Corrections Commissioner Joe Allbaugh said, \\"We don't have the flexibility in our system to segregate these gangs, so they are together in close quarters and so sometimes things happen.\\" The director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Oklahoma says the non-profit receives numerous complaints about treatment in private prisons: \\"I would say we get roughly double the number per capita from private prison inmates from public prison inmates.\\" The complaints range from safety concerns to lack of appropriate food and medical care. Oklahoma sent a \\"notice to cure\\" in October 2015 to inform Cimarron Correctional Facility that it was more than seven months behind in reporting use of force standards and reportable incidents. According to DOC's contract with CCA, the business has five days to submit proper reporting, but the state was waiting on reports dating back to March 2015. The ACLU's Brady Henderson said this demonstrated a practice within the prison system of concealing records of activities. \\"Even in public facilities, there's an incredible amount of secrecy,\\" a lack of transparency. \\"It's already hard to know. It gets 10 times harder with a private facility,\\" he said. In 2015 Allbaugh said that because of overcrowding in the Oklahoma system, his agency would continue to do business with private prison companies. \\"As much as I don't think the state ought to be doing business with private prisons, I'm glad they're around because they're our only relief valve available to us during this crunch.\\"\\"Fourth inmate dies after prisoner clash at Oklahoma prison\\", Associated Press, Sean Murphy, September 13, 2015.

Robinson found CoreCivic illegally recorded phone calls between attorneys and their incarcerated pre- trial clients at its Leavenworth, Kansas prison. Defense attorneys representing inmates objected after discovering their privileged conferences with clients had been recorded, despite CoreCivic having repeatedly assured them the meetings would be kept private. Robinson scolded prosecutors for speeding forward with an alleged prison contraband case, which she called a ‚Äúhorrendous situation‚Äù. Robinson said, \\"You all need to get your act together,\\" Robinson authorized wide latitude devoted to an investigation into recordings of phone calls and video of meetings between attorneys and inmates at Leavenworth Detention Center. Robinson said she planned to order the U.S. Department of Justice to pay for the investigation, which is expected to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Prosecutors said they obtained the recordings inadvertently while gathering evidence of a prison contraband ring that could have involved as many as 95 inmates and 60 non-inmates. A grand jury subpoena issued to the U.S. Attorney's office resulted in the provision of illegal recordings of meetings between attorneys and clients. Dozens of attorney-client phone call were provided to other lawyers in the case. Robinson said it appeared the rights of some inmates had been violated. The FBOP forbids recording in attorney-client meeting rooms yet CoreCivic contends that silent video recordings of inmate-attorney meetings ‚Äúare a standard practice‚Äù throughout the country and are used for prison security. In August 2016, Robinson ordered the recordings be halted. CoreCivic offered prisoners attorneys an option that such recordings be disabled for case conferences with their clients but a defense attorney informed the court that calls between himself and a client at Leavenworth had been recorded despite his multiple requests that such recordings end and his receipt of assurances from CoreCivic that the practice had been terminated. Barry Pollack, president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers said, \\"You have a failure on the part of the institution that is recording something that it shouldn't be. Here, they turned it over to the prosecutors.\\" \\"Anyone facing prison time needs legal counsel, and essentially, they aren't getting it.\\"Recorded prison videos are 'horrendous situation,' judge says, Kansas City Star, Ian Cummings, September 7, 2016.

History Originally founded by Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou through easyGroup Holdings Ltd, easyHotel was incorporated in 2004 and opened its first hotel in South Kensington, London in 2005. Whilst easyHotel owned its first hotel in South Kensington (which was subsequently sold and franchised in 2007), its growth strategy in its early years was to expand via franchise contracts. In 2007, Easygroup signed with Dubai-state-owned Istithmar Hotels for Istithmar to invest US$400mn in five years to build 38/3800 Easy hotels/rooms in Africa, Middle East and parts of Asia. Dubai opened in 2010; nothing since.

After six years in minor league baseball and two in the military at the time of the Korean War, Kasko played for ten MLB seasons (1957‚Äì66) with the St. Louis Cardinals, Cincinnati Reds, Houston Colt .45s/Astros and Boston Red Sox. He led National League third basemen in fielding percentage in 1960 and NL shortstops in that category four years later. Kasko was a right-handed batter who stood tall and weighed . He lacked home run power but was a good contact hitter. His career batting average was .264 in 1,077 games and 3,546 at bats. His 935 Major League hits included 146 doubles and 13 triples, as well as 22 home runs. Selected to the 1961 National League All-Star team, he appeared in that year's second all-star classic, played July 31 at Fenway Park. In the contest, a 1‚Äì1 tie shortened by rain, Kasko replaced starter Maury Wills at shortstop in the fourth inning and singled off Don Schwall of the Red Sox in the sixth frame to help the Senior Circuit score the tying run. Hall of Fame shortstop Ernie Banks pinch-hit for Kasko in the eighth inning and replaced him in the field.1961 Major League Baseball All-Star Game (game 2) box score from Retrosheet Kasko appeared in one World Series‚Äîalso in 1961, with Cincinnati. He started all five games (the New York Yankees defeated the Reds, four games to one) at shortstop, led the Reds with seven hits (all singles), scored one run, and batted .318. Defensively, he made one error in 27 chances in the field and participated in five double plays. Managing career After the 1966 season, his only campaign with Boston, Kasko retired as an active player and managed the Red Sox' Triple-A clubs, the Toronto Maple Leafs (1967) and Louisville Colonels (1968‚Äì69), to a cumulative 213‚Äì213 record and one playoff berth. He succeeded the popular Dick Williams as Red Sox manager in 1970, and guided the club through four seasons, with mixed results. The Red Sox finished above the .500 mark each season, but only contended in 1972 when they finished a half-game out of first place, behind the Detroit Tigers, in the American League East Division. The half-game differential was partly due to the brief players' strike that spring: between six and eight games were lopped off each club's schedule and it was agreed that lost games would not be \\"made up\\" to resolve pennant races. During Kasko's four-year managerial term, he incorporated young players such as Carlton Fisk and Dwight Evans into the Red Sox lineup, converted relief pitcher Bill Lee into a successful starter, and showed patience with sore-armed veteran Luis Tiant as he returned to form as a dominant pitcher. But when the 1973 Red Sox again could not measure up to the powerful Baltimore Orioles of the era, Kasko was reassigned to an executive scouting position within the organization and replaced as manager by Darrell Johnson upon season's end on September 30.\\"Darrell Johnson New Sox Leader,\\" The Associated Press (AP), Monday, October 1, 1973.

Allegro, #Finale: Presto ma non troppo, =First movement= The first movement is in sonata form: after an introduction follows an exposition that ends with a repeat sign, a development, a recapitulation and a coda. The introduction is twenty measures long and marked \\"Adagio\\". It opens with the orchestra playing the tonic note, D, in unison, avoiding the establishment of the home key of D major with root-position harmony. The introduction then proceeds on an harmonic excursion, through the dominant (A major), a Neapolitan chord (E major, built on G), a diminished seventh, the parallel minor (D minor), and the subdominant minor (G minor), before concluding with a dominant seventh chord. The principal theme of the first movement. The theme enters in the 21st measure of the movement, after an Adagio introduction. After the dominant seventh chord, the main body of the movement, marked \\"Allegro\\", commences with the statement of the principal theme. The exposition then continues with a transitional passage before a secondary theme in the dominant, A major. The American musicologist A. Peter Brown compared the secondary theme to a L√§ndler. The development involves significant re-working of a motif from the secondary theme. The motif is inverted, and passed through a series of remote keys. Unusually for a late Haydn work, the recapitulation involves few surprises. It reprises the principal and secondary themes in the tonic before a short coda. =Second movement= Towards the end of the second movement, the music gradually becomes slower and softer until an unexpected fortissimo bassoon \\"fart\\"Brown, A. Peter, The Symphonic Repertoire (Volume 2). Indiana University Press (), pp. 252-256 (2002). brings the music back for the movement's closing.

Though Thylacosmilus looks similar to the \\"saber-toothed cats\\", it was not a felid, like the well-known North American Smilodon, but a sparassodont, a group closely related to marsupials, and only superficially resembled other saber- toothed mammals due to convergent evolution. A 2005 study found that the bite forces of Thylacosmilus and Smilodon were low, which indicates the killing- techniques of saber-toothed animals differed from those of extant species. Remains of Thylacosmilus have been found primarily in Catamarca, Entre R√≠os, and La Pampa Provinces in northern Argentina.  Taxonomy  Partally reconstructed holotype skull, Field Museum of Natural History In 1926, the Marshall Field Paleontological Expeditions collected mammal fossils from the Ituzaing√≥ Formation of Corral Quemado, in Catamarca Province, northern Argentina. Three specimens were recognized as representing a new type of marsupial, related to the borhyaenids, and were reported to the Paleontological Society of America in 1928, though without being named. In 1933, the American paleontologist Elmer S. Riggs named and preliminarily described the new genus Thylacosmilus based on these specimens, while noting that a full description was being prepared and would be published at a later date. He named two new species in the genus, T. atrox and T. lentis. The generic name Thylacosmilus means \\"pouch knife\\", while the specific name atrox means \\"cruel\\". Riggs found the genus distinct enough to warrant a new subfamily within Borhyaenidae, Thylacosmilinae, and stated it was \\"one of the most unique flesh-eating mammals of all times\\". The holotype specimen of T. atrox, FMNH PP14531, was collected by Riggs and an assistant. It consists of a skull with the teeth of the right side entirely preserved as well as the left canine found separate in the matrix, fragments of the mandibles, and a partial skeleton consisting of a humerus, a broken radius and broken femora, and foot bones. Missing and scattered parts of the skull and mandible were reconstructed and fitted together. Specimen P 14344 was designated as the paratype of T. atrox, and consists of the skull, the mandible, seven cervical, two dorsal, two lumbar, and two sacral vertebrae, a femur, a tibia, a fibula, and various foot bones. It was one fourth smaller than the holotype, and may have been a young adult. It was collected by the American paleontologist Robert C. Thorne. The holotype of T. lentis, specimen P 14474, is a partial skull with the teeth of the right side preserved, and is about the same size as the T. atrox paratype. It was collected a few miles away from the by the German biologist Rudolf Stahlecker. These specimens were housed at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, while the T. lentis type later became part of the Museum of La Plata collection. In 1934, Riggs fully described the animal, after the fossils had been prepared and compared with other mammals from the same formation and better known borhyaenids from the Santa Cruz Formation. Holotype skull in multiple views More fragmentary Thylacosmilus specimens were since discovered. Riggs and the American paleontologist Bryan Patterson reported in 1939 that a canine (MLP 31-XI-12-4) tentatively assigned to Achlysictis or Stylocynus by the Argentinian paleontologist Lucas Kraglievich in 1934 belonged to Thylacosmilus. A partial right ramus and front half of a skull (MLP 65_VI 1-29-41.) was collected in 1965. In a 1972 thesis, the Argentinian paleontologist Jorge Zetti suggested that T. atrox and T. lentis represented a single species, and the American paleontologist Larry G, Marshall agreed in 1976, stating the features distinguishing the two were of dubious taxonomic value, and probably due to differences in age and sex. He also found it hard to explain how two sympatric species (related species that lived in the same area at the same time) would be virtually identical in their specializations. Marshall also suggested Hyaenodonops could be cogeneric, though it was impossible to determine from the available specimens.Riggs, E.S. and Patterson, B., 1939, Stratigraphy of the late Miocene and Pliocene deposits of the Province of Catamarca (Argentina) with notes on the fauna.

PaleoBios, 23, 1‚Äì30. = Evolution = saber toothed mammals Megantereon and Thylacosmilus Atlas, axis, and limb bones; the outlines of the missing foot bones are restored after the thylacine Though Thylacosmilus is one of several predatory mammal genera typically called \\"saber-toothed cats\\", it was not a felid placentalian, but a sparassodont, a group closely related to marsupials, and only superficially resembled other saber-toothed mammals due to convergent evolution. The term \\"saber-tooth\\" refers to an ecomorph consisting of various groups of extinct predatory synapsids (mammals and close relatives), which convergently evolved extremely long maxillary canines, as well as adaptations to the skull and skeleton related to their use. This includes members of Gorgonopsia, Thylacosmilidae, Machaeroidinae, Nimravidae, Barbourofelidae, and Machairodontinae. The cladogram below shows the position of Thylacosmilus within Sparassodonta, according to Suarez and colleagues, 2015.  Description  Size (orange) compared to that of a human and other predators Body mass for sparassodonts is difficult to estimate, since these animals have relatively large heads in proportion to their bodies, leading to overestimations, particularly when compared with skulls of modern members of Carnivora, which have different locomotory and functional adaptations, or with those of the recent predatory marsupials, which do not exceed 30 kg of body mass. Recent methods, like Ercoli and Prevosti's (2011) linear regressions on postcranial elements that directly support the body's weight (such as tibiae, humeri and ulnae), comparing Thylacosmilus to both extinct and modern carnivorans and metatherians, suggest that it weighed between , with one estimate suggesting up to , about the same size as a modern jaguar. The differences in weight estimations may be due to the individual size variation of the specimens studied in each analysis, as well as the different samples and methods used. In any case, the weight estimations are consistent for terrestrial species that are generalists or have some degree of cursoriality. A weight in this range would make Thylacosmilus one of the largest known carnivorous metatherians. =Skull= Details in the skull and teeth, compared with Megantereon Thylacosmilus had large, saber-like canines. The roots of these canines grew throughout the animal's life, growing in an arc up the maxilla and above the orbits. Thylacosmilus teeth are in many aspects even more specialized than the teeth of other sabertoothed predators. In these animals the predatory function of the \\"sabres\\" gave rise to a specialization of the general dentition, in which some teeth were reduced or lost. In Thylacosmilus the canines are relatively longer and more slender, relatively triangular in cross-section, in contrast with the oval shape of carnivorans' saber-like canines. The function of these large canines was once thought to have apparently even eliminated the need for functional incisors, while carnivorans like Smilodon and Barbourofelis still have a full set of incisors. However, evidence in the form of wear facets on the internal sides of the lower canines of Thylacosmilus indicate that the animal did indeed have incisors, though they remain hitherto unknown due to poor fossilization and the fact that no specimen thus far has been preserved with its premaxilla intact. Skull cast mounted with open jaws, North American Museum of Ancient Life In Thylacosmilus there is also evidence of the reduction of postcanine teeth, which developed only a tearing cusp, as a continuation of the general trend observed in other sparassodonts, which lost many of the grinding surfaces in the premolars and molars. The canines were hypsodont and more anchored in the skull, with more than half of the tooth contained within the alveoli, which were extended over the braincase. They were protected by the large symphyseal flange and they were powered by the highly developed musculature of the neck, which allowed forceful downward and backward movements of the head. The canines had only a thin layer of enamel, just 0.25 mm in its maximum depth at the lateral facets, this depth being consistent down the length of the teeth. The teeth had open roots and grew constantly, which eroded the abrasion marks that are present in the surface of the enamel of other sabertooths, such as Smilodon. The sharp serrations of the canines were maintained by the action of the wear with the lower canines, a process known as thegosis. The convex upper portion of the maxilla is ornamented with extensive furrows and pits. This texturing has been correlated with an extensive network of blood vessels, which may suggest that the upper maxilla was covered by some form of soft tissue which tentatively has been hypothesized as a \\"horn covering\\" (keratinous structure). =Postcranial skeleton= Restoration Although the postcranial remains of Thylacosmilus are incomplete, the elements recovered so far allow the examination of characteristics that this animal acquired in convergence with the sabertooth felids. Its cervical vertebrae were very strong and to some extent resembled the vertebrae of Machairodontinae; also the cervical vertebrae have neural apophysis well developed, along with ventral apophysis in some cervicals, an element that is characteristic of other borhyaenoids. The lumbar vertebrae are short and more rigid than in Prothylacynus. The bones of the limbs, like the humerus and femur, are very robust, since they probably had to deal with larger forces than in the modern felids. In particular, the features of the humerus suggest a great development of the pectoral and deltoid muscles, not only required to capture its prey, also to absorb the energy of the impact of the collision with such prey. Vertebrae The features of the hindlimb, with a robust femur equipped with a greater trochanter in the lower part, the short tibia and plantigrade feet shows that this animal was not a runner, and probably stalked its prey animals. The hindlimbs also allowed a certain mobility of the hip, and possibly the ability to stand up only with its hindlimbs, like Prothylacynus and Borhyaena. Contrary to felids, barbourofelids and nimravids, the claws of Thylacosmilus were not retractable.  Palaeobiology Diet and feeding= Restoration of the head Recent comparative biomechanical analysis have estimated the bite force of T. atrox, starting from maximum gape, at , much weaker than that of a leopard, suggesting its jaw muscles had an insignificant role in the dispatch of prey. Its skull was similar to that of Smilodon in that it was much better adapted to withstand loads applied by the neck musculature, which, along with evidence for powerful and flexible forelimb musculature and other skeleton adaptations for stability, support the hypothesis that its killing method consisted on immobilization of its prey followed by precisely directed, deep bites into the soft tissue driven by powerful neck muscles. It has been suggested that its specialized predatory lifestyle could be linked to more extensive parental care than in modern marsupial predators, due that the killing technique only could be used by adult individuals with a full development of its peculiar dental anatomy and grasping abilities; it could require some time for young individuals to learn the necessary skills, although there are no clear evidence in the fossils Thylacosmilus and this kind of cooperative behavior is unknown in modern marsupials. CT scans of the skulls of Smilodon and Thylacosmilus, showing the extent of the canines (red) within the jaw, with Thylacosmilus skull in side and front view below In 1988 Juan C. Quiroga published a study on the cerebral cortex of two proterotherids and Thylacosmilus. The study examines endocranial casts of two Thylacosmilus specimens: MLP 35-X-41-1 (from the Montehermosan age in Catamarca Province), which represents a natural cast of the left half of the cranial cavity lacking the anterior part of the olfactory bulbs and the brain hemispheres; and MMP 1443 (from the Chapadmalalan age in Buenos Aires Province), which is a complete, artificial cast that shows some ventral displacement but with the anterior right part of the brain hemisphere and olfactory bulb. Quiroga's analysis showed that the somatic nervous system of Thylacosmilus represented 27% of the entire cortex, with the visual area representing 18% and the auditory area 7%. The paleocortex was more than 8%. The sulci of the cortex are relatively complex and similar in pattern and number to the modern diprotodont marsupials. Compared with Macropus and Trichosurus, Thylacosmilus had less development of the maxillar area with respect to the mandibular area, and the rhinal fissure is taller than in Macropus and Thylacinus. This disproportion between the maxillar and mandibular areas, which are roughly similar in marsupials, seems to be a consequence of the extreme development of the neck and mandibular musculature, used in the functioning of the osteodentary anatomy of this animal. However, the area dedicated to the oral- mandible region comprises 42% of the somatic area. The comparison between the endocranial casts of Thylacosmilus and a proterotherid specimen (possibly a species coevolving with Thylacosmilus and a potential prey item) indicates that Thylacosmilus had only half of the encephalization and a quarter of the cortical area, however it has more somatized areas, similar visual areas and less auditory area, which suggests different sensomotoric qualities between both animals. The analysis published by Christine Argot in 2002 about the evolution of predatory borhyaenoids suggests that Thylacosmilus was a specialized form, which have a limited stereoscopic vision with small eyes, with an overlap of 50-60¬∞, very low compared with modern predators, but the ossified and great auditory bulla and the muscular body would indicate that it could be an ambush predator in open and relatively dry environments, where the sound absorption is lesser than in more humid areas, and the acute hearing could compensate the limited vision. Argot suggested that Thylacosmilus maybe was an nocturnal hunter, as modern lions. A 2005 study published by Wroe et al. analysing bite-forces with the use of regressions on body mass and applying the model of \\"dry skull\\" in which the jaw is modeled as a lever based in relations between the skull dimensions and the jaw muscles, was employed in some extinct and extant placental and metatherian predatory mammals. Thylacosmilus atrox reached the lowest value in that analysis, just barely surpassed by Smilodon fatalis. The authors concluded that both taxa, with low bite forces and peculiar cranial and postcranial anatomies, had a killing technique to dispatch large bodied preys without a true analogue between modern taxa. An analysis by Goswami et al. in 2010 tested if the metatherian mode of reproduction has produced any constraint in their cranial morphological evolution. Using landmarks in the skulls of several eutherian and metatherian meat-eating lineages, they compared the ecomorphological convergences in these groups. Metatherian lineages, including specialised forms as Thylacoleo and Thylacosmilus, showed values in morphospace more similar to caniniforms than felids, due that even the shortening of the skull and reduction of postcanine teeth are not so drastic as in felids, despite them often being compared to feliform eutherians. The study shows that in any case, metatherians could be so diverse in cranial diversity as its eutherian counterparts, even with very extreme forms as Thylacosmilus itself and that the metherian development doesn't have any significative role in cranial evolution. A 2020 study found several functional disparities between Thylacosmilus's cranial anatomy and that of saber-toothed eutherians that cannot be explained by its metatherian status, such as the lack of a jaw symphysis, subtriangular canines instead of blade-like ones, lack of incisors (that would render feline-like feeding behaviours impossible), weak jaw musculature and unaligned teeth with no evidence of shearing activity, as well as a post-cranial skeleton more akin to that of a bear than a cursorial predator like a cat. This study very tentatively suggests that Thylacosmilus might have been an intestine specialist that sucked up the prey/carcasse's entrails. An isotope ratio study, using stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen from the tooth enamel of several mammals from the Pampean region from the Late Miocene to Late Pleistocene, was published by Domingo et al. in 2020 and indicates that the favoured prey of Thylacosmilus were grazers, mainly notoungulates from open areas. This diet seems to coincide with the expansion of vast grasslands of C4 plants in southern South America and the increasing of aridity and lower temperatures, in the interval between 11-3 million years ago known as Edad de las Planicies Australes (\\"Age of the Southern Plains\\", in Spanish). =Motion= Various studies have been published on the musculature and motion of Thylacosmilus. The analysis made by William Turnbull published in 1976 and 1978 included a reconstruction of the masticatory muscles of Thylacosmilus modelling them with plasticine over a cast of the skull and following the muscle scars on the surface of the fossil, then making a rubber model of the musculature and calculating the percentage of weight of these muscles compared with recent mammals, he concluded that the muscles involved in jaw closing in this animal were not unusual in size neither in form, compared with modern carnivore mammals, even indicating that they weren't so reduced as in the machairodont felids. Turnbull concluded that in Thylacosmilus these masticatory muscles was not involved at all in the use of the sabertooth canines, which depended of the large neck muscles and the flexion of the head to be used killing the prey, combining in a sense the stabbing and slashing techniques from \\"dirk-toothed\\" and \\"scimitar\\" sabertooths. The comparative studies of Argot 2004, indicates that the basicranium had rugose crests that served as attachments for the neck flexor muscles, which are associated to the increase of the bite strength. The deltopectoral crest is large, with 60% of the length of the humerus, which is correlated with musculature to manipulate heavy prey. This animal had an absent entepicondylar foramen in the humerus, which is correlated with the reduction of the abduction movement in that bone in cursorial ungulates and carnivores (Borhyaena also show this condition), although it contrasts with its probable powerful adductor muscles. Although the lumbar vertebrae are not completely known, the two last ones are known and suggest for its vertical neural process that there is not an anticlinal vertebra; probably the muscles of the back (m. longissimus dorsi) acted to stabilize the column and contribute to body propulsion, as occurs in Smilodon, which contrast with more flexible backs of the closest relatives of these sabertooth taxa.  Distribution and habitat  Based on studies of its habitat, Thylacosmilus is believed to have hunted in savanna-like or sparsely forested areas, avoiding the more open plains where it would have faced competition with the more successful and aggressive Phorusrhacids it shared its environment with. Fossils of Thylacosmilus have been found in the Huayquerian (Late Miocene) Ituzaing√≥, Epecu√©n, and Cerro Azul Formations and the Montehermosan (Early Pliocene) Brochero and Monte Hermoso Formations in Argentina.Thylacosmilus at Fossilworks.org  Extinction  Although older references have often stated that Thylacosmilus became extinct due to competition with the \\"more competitive\\" saber-toothed cat Smilodon during the Great American Interchange, newer studies have shown this is not the case. Thylacosmilus died out during the Pliocene (3.6 to 2.58 Ma) whereas saber-toothed cats are not known from South America until the Middle Pleistocene (781,000 to 126,000 years ago). As a result, the last appearance of Thylacosmilus is separated from the first appearance of Smilodon by over one and a half million years.

It was completed in 1792 as part of the set of symphonies composed on his first trip to London. It was first performed at the Hanover Square Rooms in London on 2 March 1792. History Haydn composed the symphony in early 1792. At the time, Haydn was in the midst of the first of his two visits to London, under contract to perform a series of new symphonies with an orchestra led by Johann Peter Salomon as concertmaster. The symphony was performed on 2 March 1792 at the Hanover Square Rooms, with Haydn directing the orchestra from the keyboard. The premiere came two weeks after that of the Symphony No. 93, and one week before that of the Sinfonia Concertante. Haydn recalled that at the premiere of the No. 98, the first and fourth movements were encored. Instrumentation The work is scored for one flute, two oboes, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, timpani, strings and cembalo.Steinberg, Michael, The Symphony: A Listeners Guide (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1995), pp. 225‚Äì229. At the symphony‚Äôs premiere, Haydn likely played the cembalo part on a fortepiano, but in many modern performances the part is played on a harpsichord, which is what the German word cembalo means. The cembalo part is only scored for a brief solo in the fourth movement, but Haydn would have conducted the premiere sitting at the keyboard and probably used it in a continuo role throughout the whole of the symphony. In modern performances, the B horn part is commonly played with B basso, rather than B alto, horns. It is likely that B basso horns were preferred in the 1792 premiere, making the symphony the first of Haydn‚Äôs to employ the instrument. The trumpet and timpani parts are also scored in B. Movements #Adagio ‚Äì Allegro, #Adagio, #Menuetto. Presto, #Finale. Presto, =First movement: Adagio ‚Äì Allegro= The first line shows the first four measures (first violins) of the Adagio introduction to the first movement. The second line shows the first four measures (first violins) of the movement's Allegro section, which serves as the principal theme of the sonata form movement. The first movement is in sonata form and is preceded by an introduction marked \\"Adagio\\". The introduction is in B minor, and consists of three differing statements of an upwards broken chord, followed by a downward motion. Haydn then uses the introductory motif as the primary theme of the \\"Allegro\\" section of the movement, although this time it is in B major. The use of common thematic material in an introduction and a movement proper is an uncommon compositional device for the time. After its first statement in the Allegro, the motif then proceeds to dominate the entire movement. The exposition modulates to the dominant (F major), as is conventional for a sonata form movement in a major key, but no new theme is presented. Instead, the opening theme, albeit in a varied form, is reprised in the new key. The sonata can thus be called monothematic. After the exposition follows a long development section, then a recapitulation that involves unusually significant variations to the material presented in the exposition. =Second movement: Adagio= The strings introduce the main theme of the second movement (measures 1 to 4). The theme is almost identical to the Agnus Dei in Mozart's Coronation Mass. Haydn would return to the theme in his Harmoniemesse. The movement is in F major and sonata form. There are no trumpet or timpani parts. The movement, solemn and hymn-like, makes noticeable use of material from two works by Mozart, the Coronation Mass and Symphony No. 41 (\\"Jupiter\\"), and it was possibly intended by Haydn as a tribute to his friend and fellow-composer, who died in December 1791: Haydn was composing the symphony when he heard, and was greatly distressed by, the news of his friend's death.http://www.adparnassum.org/pdf/abstracts/13.pdf The movement's principal theme, introduced by the strings and marked \\"cantabile\\", is an almost exact quotation from Agnus Dei from Mozart's Coronation Mass; a resemblance to \\"God Save the King\\" has also been noted. The second theme is in the dominant (C major). The exposition is not repeated. Instead there is a transition section into the development. It is in this transition that the quotation from Mozart's Symphony No. 41 (\\"Jupiter\\") appears. The recapitulation involves new treatments of the principal theme: on its first reprise, the theme is accompanied by a passage for solo cello in counterpoint. After the second theme is reprised, the oboes present the first theme again. Six measures from the end of the movement, the first two measures of the theme are presented for a final time, by an oboe and a bassoon with a chromatic accompaniment from the strings. The movement then fades to a pianissimo conclusion. The chromaticism accompanying the final statement of the theme was omitted from published editions of the symphony until the 1950s, when H. C. Robbins Landon restored Haydn's original score. Haydn went on to quote the Agnus Dei of Mozart's Coronation Mass even more exactly in the Agnus Dei of his own Harmoniemesse, and his scoring reflects that of the Adagio in his Symphony 98. Heartz (2009), p. 661‚Äì662 =Third movement: Menuetto= The third movement is a fast minuet and trio. The minuet is in B major. Its second section starts conventionally in the dominant of F major but shifts into A major for a flute solo. The trio remains in B major, but omits the trumpets, horns and timpani. The music critic Michael Steinberg described the trio as \\"gently rustic\\". =Finale: Presto= The fourth movement is the longest finale among Haydn's symphonies. It is in sonata form and time. The exposition is repeated, and after it concludes in the dominant of F major, there is a lengthy pause before the development commences in A major. The development contains modulations through a wide range of keys and prominent solos for the principal violin who, in the premiere performance, was Johann Peter Salomon. The principal violin's part continues into the beginning of the recapitulation when it plays the first theme as a solo. After the recapitulation there is a lengthy coda, in which Haydn slows the tempo to \\"piu moderato\\" but then introduces sixteenth notes to give the movement a new momentum. Towards the end of the coda comes the surprising keyboard solo, consisting of an 11-measure passage of sixteenth notes. Haydn was not a keyboard virtuoso. But the composer and organist Samuel Wesley, who was at the 1792 premiere, recollected that Haydn had executed the keyboard solo proficiently: :\\"His Performance on the Piano Forte, although not such as to stamp him a first rate artist upon that Instrument, was indisputably neat and distinct. In the Finale of one of his Symphonies is a Passage of attractive Brilliancy, which he has given to the Piano Forte, and which the Writer of this Memoir remembers him to have executed with the utmost Accuracy and Precision.\\" A typical performance of the symphony lasts about 26 minutes.

It is considered the worst marine disaster in the history of the island. In addition to local ships, the storm wrecked much of the New England fishing fleet that was working in the waters, giving the gale its name. At least 74 ships were destroyed, and 150 crew were killed. General Description A detailed description of the gale was published by James D. Lawson in the Prince Edward Island Magazine. This account cited a favorable weather with a cloudless sky and gentle winds. Other accounts would detail how a brassy appearance was witnessed in the northwest sky on the afternoon of October 3. Long swells started moving into the Gulf of St. Lawrence from the southeast, as the wind began to pick up out of the same quarter. The wind backed to the northeast that evening, increasing to gale force. Surface pressures across the region begin to fall rapidly, with one barometer on Nova Scotia falling 31 hPa or mb/nearly 1 inch within 23 hours. The gales continued for nearly two days, according to one of the sea captain's logs from the area. The Yankee Gale occurred less than six months after a previously devastating gale called Minot's Light Storm hit the Gulf of St. Lawrence and destroyed the lighthouse off Cohasset. Effects On land the cyclone had minimal effect, but out at sea the storm was significantly more damaging. Ships at sea realized a storm was approaching, and tried to sail east of Prince Edward Island. Northeast gales blocked their progress. Ships attempted to hold position, but their sails tore away in the wind and they drifted towards the island. Ships at anchor either sank at anchor or were capsized by other ships ramming them during the cyclone. Most of the American fishing fleet fell victim to the storm. At least 74 ships and 150 lives were lost. Today, the tombs of the Yankee Gale victims can still be found in the cemetery near the Cape Tryon lighthouse.

Early years Figueroa was the second of eight siblings born to Jesus Figueroa and Carmen Sanabria in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. Both his parents performed in concerts and were also music instructors. Raised in a musically inclined family, it was to no surprise that eventually Figueroa and his brothers and sisters were to become the foundation of one of Puerto Rico's greatest musical dynasties. They received their first music lessons from their parents. By the time Figueroa was 10 years old, he played the piano and his brother Jos√© played the violin in front of live audiences, performing the sonatas of Mozart and Beethoven. Figueroa and his siblings went to Spain to study music in the Royal Conservatory of Music of Madrid. He studied music and harmony and when he graduated he won two awards, \\"Primer Premio en Piano\\"(First Prize in Piano) and \\"M√∫sica de C√°mara\\"(Chamber Music). The director of the Conservatory invited Figueroa and his brother Jaime (Kachiro) on a musical tour throughout Spain, Portugal and Africa. Needless to say, the brothers took advantage of this opportunity. Figueroa went to Paris after the tour and enrolled in the \\"Ecole Normale de Musique\\" (Normal School of Music) under the tutorship of Alfred Cortat. Musical career Figueroa returned to Puerto Rico in 1940 after entertaining audiences all over Europe. In the island he formed the Brothers Figueroa Quintet. Narciso played the piano, Jose played first violin, Jaime played second violin, Guillermo the viola and Rafael the cello. His sisters, Leonor, Carmelina and Angelina would sometimes participate. During this time, Figueroa was also named professor and director of the piano department of the Conservatory of Music of Puerto Rico, a position which he held for many years. In 1959, he published \\"Canciones de Puerto Rico\\" (Songs of Puerto Rico), which contained some his compositions based on the folklore of Puerto Rico. Figueroa is credited with modernizing the Puerto Rican danzas and is therefore known as the \\"Father of the Modern Danzas\\".Puerto Rico Popular Culture Danzas He composed the following danzas: * A√±oranzas - (What I Miss) * Danza negra para piano y voz - (Black danza for piano and voice) * Me voy pa' Niu Yol - (I'm going to Nue YorK) * Recuerdos - (Memories) * Illusion He also composed the following Christmas themes: * Aguinaldo J√≠baro * Camino de Belen * El Arbol de Navidad * El pobre zapatero * Nochebuena * Soy un pobre J√≠baro Later years On April 27, 1997, Figueroa was inducted into the Puerto Rican Danza Composers Hall of Fame, located in the town of San German, Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rican Institute of Culture dedicated the 1997 week of the danza to Figueroa. Narciso Figueroa died in his home in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico on September 4, 2004 at the age of 98. Legacy The offspring of the Fiqueroa family have continued the family musical tradition. Guillermo Figueroa Jr., Narciso Figueroa Jr. and Rafael Figueroa Jr. belong to the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra and they are the first chairs of the Metropolitan Opera House. Guillermo Jr., who is also the conductor of the Puerto Rico Symphony, is the leader of the \\"Figueroa Quartet\\", which is considered the official chamber quartet of Puerto Rico. The quartet includes Guillermo Jr. and Narciso Jr. on the violins, Rafael Jr. on the cello and as pianist Ivonne Figueroa. The novelist Mayra Montero wrote a novel titled \\"Vana Ilusi√≥n\\" based on the life and times of Narciso Figueroa.

French music originated as a unified style in medieval times, focusing around the Notre-Dame school of composers. This group developed the motet, a specific musical composition. Troubadours and trouv√®res soon began touring France, composing and performing many original songs. The styles of ars nova and ars subtilior sprung up in the 14th century, both of which focused on secular songs. As Europe moved into the Renaissance age, the music of France continued to evolve. The popularity of French music in the rest of Europe declined slightly, yet the popular chanson and the old motet were further developed during this time. The epicenter of French music moved from Paris to Burgundy, as it followed the Burgundian School of composers. During the Baroque period, music was simplified and restricted due to Calvinist influence. The air de cour then became the primary style of French music, as it was secular and preferred by the royal court. Medieval music Some of the earliest manuscripts with polyphony are organa from 10th century French cities like Chartres and Tours. The Saint Martial school is especially important, as are the 12th century Parisian composers at the Notre-Dame school from whence came the earliest motets. Secular music in medieval France was dominated by troubadours, jongleurs and trouv√®res, who were poets and musicians known for creating forms like the ballade (forme fixe) and lai. The most famous of the trouv√®re was Adam de la Halle. = Saint Martial school = The Saint Martial school, named after the Abbey of Saint Martial around which it was centered, was an important group in the development of early French music. The school created various forms of music based on poetry. These forms of music were often organa consisting of elaborate proses and tropes. Important composers from this school include Roger de Chabannes and his nephew and student Ad√©mar de Chabannes. The manuscripts written by these two became very popular and included early uses of troper-prosers and sequentiaries. The duo also pioneered a new form of notation for their work that collected new forms of liturgical poetry. While polyphony was not invented at the Saint Martial school, the group developed it extensively and brought it into common use. All of these contributions made the Saint Martial school an important precursor to the later Notre-Dame school. =Notre-Dame school= The Notre- Dame school was a group of composers who used a style of polyphonic organum that flourished at Paris' Notre-Dame Cathedral between about 1170 to 1250. The only composers whose names have survived are L√©onin and P√©rotin. These two are believed to have written the Magnus Liber, a comprehensive book of organum. Motet The motet, a lyrical piece of music in several parts, evolved from the Notre-Dame school when upper-register voices were added to discant sections, usually strophic interludes, in a longer sequence of organum. Usually the discant representing a strophic sequence in Latin which was sung as a descant over a cantus firmus, which typically was a Gregorian chant fragment with different words from the descant. The motet took a definite rhythm from the words of the verse, and as such appeared as a brief rhythmic interlude in the middle of the longer, more chantlike organum. =Troubadours= Bernard de Ventadour, a well-known troubador In the 12th century, traveling noblemen and musicians called troubadours began traveling southern France. Inspired by the Code of Chivalry, troubadours composed and performed vernacular songs, in contrast to the older tradition dating back to the 10th century of goliards. The tradition seems to have originated in Aquitaine, and troubadours became most prominent in Europe in the late 11th and early 12th centuries. Provence was the region with the most troubadours, but the practice soon spread north and aristocrats like Adam de la Halle became the first trouv√®res. Contemporaneous with the troubadours, the trouv√®res, another itinerant class of musicians, used the langue d'oil, while the troubadours used langue d'oc. This period ended abruptly with the Albigensian Crusade, which decimated southern France. =Ars nova and ars subtilior= Two of the major developments in music in the 14th century occurred in France. The first was ars nova, a new, predominantly secular style of music. It began with the publication of the Roman de Fauvel and culminated in the rondeaux, ballades, lais, virelais, motets, and single surviving mass of Guillaume de Machaut, who died in 1377. Philippe de Vitry, also a representative of ars nova, invented an improved system of musical notation and may have been the first composer of the isorhythmic motet. The other important development was the extremely complex and sophisticated art of secular song which flourished in Avignon at the very end of the 14th century, ars subtilior. Ars subtilior immediately followed ars nova, and as the Latin definition suggests, this style was subtler than the earlier works. Ars subtilior was also even more complex, making it difficult to sing and most popular among music specialists. =French-language music= The earliest known French-language song is Le Carillon de Vend√¥me, dating from the early 15th century. Renaissance music The move of the center of musical activity from Paris to Burgundy defines the beginning of the musical Renaissance in France. The political instability under weak kings and continued dismemberment and acquisition of territory by the English during the Hundred Years' War all contributed to moving musicians east. French musical domination of Europe ended during the Renaissance, and Flemish and Italian musicians became more important. Later French composers of the Renaissance include Nicolas Gombert, Pierre de La Rue, Pierre de Manchicourt, Claude Goudimel, Pierre Certon, Jean Mouton, Claudin de Sermisy, and Cl√©ment Janequin. The French chanson became popular during this time, and was exported to Italy as the canzona. =Motet= The motet was known from the Medieval era, but after about 1463, it evolved into an utterly distinct form. The cascading, passing chords created by the interplay between multiple voices and the absence of a strong or obvious beat are the features that distinguish the medieval vocal styles from those of the Renaissance. Instead, the Renaissance motet was a short polyphonic musical setting in imitative counterpoint, for chorus, of a religious text not specifically connected to the liturgy of a given day, and therefore suitable for use in any service. The cantus firmus was extended during the Renaissance period, making the motet suitable for use in a larger variety of services. The texts of antiphons were frequently used as motet texts. This is the sort of composition that is most familiarly called by the name of \\"motet,\\" and the Renaissance period marked the flowering of the form. =Chanson= The chanson encompasses a wide array of forms and styles of secular song, through a period of almost three hundred years. The first important composer of chansons was Guillaume de Machaut, with later figures in the genre including Johannes Ockeghem and Josquin des Prez. Guillaume Dufay and Gilles Binchois wrote so-called Burgundian chansons, which were somewhat simpler in style, while Claudin de Sermisy and Cl√©ment Janequin were composers of so-called Parisian chansons which abandoned the formes fixes (as Josquin had also done) and were in a simpler, more homophonic style (many of these Parisian works were published by Pierre Attaingnant). Later composers, such as Orlando de Lassus, were influenced by the Italian madrigal. =Burgundian School= Composers who worked at the courts of the Dukes of Burgundy are known collectively as the Burgundian School; some of the principal names associated with this school are Guillaume Dufay, Gilles Binchois, Hayne van Ghizeghem and Antoine Busnois. They wrote vernacular secular music in a clear, simple, melodic style, principally rondeaux, but also Latin sacred music, such as motets and cantus firmus masses. Baroque music \\"Les Cinq Sens: L'Ou√Øe\\", an etching by Abraham Bosse, c. 1638 With the arrival of Calvinism, music was relatively simple, at least in the parts of France subject to Calvinist influence. In strictly Calvinist areas, the only musical expression allowed was singing of French translations of the Psalms, for instance those written by Goudimel (who was killed in the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre in 1572). Starting with the 17th century, Italian and German opera was the most influential form of music, though French opera composers like Balthasar de Beaujoyeaux, Jean Philippe Rameau and Jean Baptiste Lully made a distinctive national style characterized by dance rhythms, spoken dialogue and a lack of Italian recitative arias. The Baroque period saw a flourishing of harpsichord music. Influential composers included Jacques Champion de Chambonni√®res, Louis Couperin, √âlisabeth Jacquet de La Guerre, Fran√ßois Couperin. Jean Philippe Rameau, a prominent opera composer, wrote an influential treatise on musical theory, especially in the subject of harmony; he also introduced the clarinet into his orchestras. =Air de cour= In the late Renaissance and early Baroque period, approximately from 1570 to 1650 and peaking from 1610 and 1635, a type of popular secular vocal music called air de cour spread throughout France. Though airs de cour originally used only one voice with lute accompaniment, they grew to incorporate four to five voices by the end of the 16th century. Halfway through the 17th century, they switched back again to a single voice.

It is notably the first of his symphonies written after the completion of the six Paris symphonies in 1786. The symphony was completed in 1787, just like his 89th symphony. It is one of Haydn's best-known works, even though it is not one of the Paris or London symphonies and does not have a descriptive nickname. It is sometimes referred to as The Letter V referring to an older method of cataloging Haydn's symphonic output. Movements The work is in standard four movement form and scored for flute, two oboes, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, timpani, continuo (harpsichord) and strings. #Adagio ‚Äî Allegro #Largo #Menuetto: Allegretto #Finale. Allegro con spirito The first movement begins with a brief introduction which quickly settles to the dominant chord to prepare for the main body of the movement. The strings open the Allegro stating the main theme and the rest of the movement develops from there, with almost every statement deriving from a previous idea.Brown, A. Peter, The Symphonic Repertoire (Volume 2). Indiana University Press (), pp. 227-230 (2002). The exposition is monothematic and the development continues to make use of that single melodic idea. In the recapitulation, the initial statement of the theme is embellished by a solo flute. The slow movement in D major consists mainly of embellishments of the legato oboe and solo cello theme which opens it, though every so often is punctuated by chords played by the whole orchestra. After hearing this slow movement, Johannes Brahms is said to have remarked, 'I want my Ninth Symphony to sound like this'.Classical CDs of the week: Borrowed Time, Haydn, Brahms and more... The Daily Telegraph, 15 September 2007 It is the second of Haydn's symphonies to use trumpets and timpani in the slow movement, the first being the Symphony no. 60 'Il Distratto' of 1774.

History The program for the M88 arose from a need for a suitable propulsion system for air-superiority and ground-attack missions. In 1983, Dassault Aviation planned to produce a technology demonstrator for the Avion de Combat eXp√©rimental (ACX), which was expected to fly in 1986. Although the M88 was intended to be fitted to the definitive aircraft, it was not expected to be ready in time, and the ACX was therefore initially powered by the General Electric F404. Due to the broad application of the new engine (as the aircraft was to replace considerable number of French fleet), it was necessary for the engine to have a high thrust-to-weight ratio, low fuel consumption in all flight regimes, and a long engine life. Additional considerations were afforded to good maintainability, and upgrade potential (73 kN to 105 kN using the same core). The program was officially launched in 1986. It was decided to flight test the engine, the M88-2, aboard the Dassault Breguet, and the Rafale A prototype. Indeed, after having replaced the aircraft's left F404, the engine was first flight tested aboard the Rafale A on 27 February 1990. By now, the fourteen M88-2s had accumulated 1,600 hours of running time. The demonstrator thereafter reached supersonic speed without afterburners, reached a height of 50,000 ft, endured load factors of ‚àí2g and +9g and flown at an angle of attack of 30¬∞. Within 14 months of its flight aboard the Rafale A, the M88-2 had amassed 75 hours on 65 flights.

In a 1987 Sports Illustrated poll of National League catchers, Weyer was rated the best at calling balls and strikes. He was the home plate umpire on September 11, 1985 in Cincinnati's Riverfront Stadium when Pete Rose collected his 4,192nd hit to break Ty Cobb's career record, and was the third base umpire in the April 8, 1974 game in which Hank Aaron broke Babe Ruth's record of 714 career home runs. Early life and career Born in Imlay City, Michigan, Weyer had a few tryouts for the minor leagues as a player before beginning his umpiring career in 1956 on the advice of NL umpire and local resident Frank Secory. He worked in the Midwest League (1956‚Äì57), Southern Association (1958‚Äì59) and International League (1960‚Äì61), and was first placed under contract with the NL at age 23 in 1959 while he was in the Army. He was scheduled to join the league's regular staff for the 1961 season, to help prepare for the league's expansion from eight teams to ten the following year, until a February car accident which also took his mother's life; after six months of recuperation he finally made his debut by working a few NL games in September 1961. His ongoing commitment to the U.S. Army Reserve until July 1962 delayed his joining the staff full-time for another season; after again umpiring some International League games, he worked some NL games in August 1962, filling in for Chris Pelekoudas, who was recuperating from abdominal surgery, then became a full member of the league staff in 1963 to replace the retired Dusty Boggess. MLB umpiring career Weyer umpired in the World Series in 1969, 1976, 1982 and 1987, serving as crew chief in 1976 and 1982. He also officiated in five National League Championship Series (1971, 1974, 1978, 1983, 1986, as crew chief in 1978), the 1981 National League Division Series (Western Division), and four All-Star games (1965, 1972, 1979, 1984), calling balls and strikes for the last of these. Weyer was behind the plate on April 16, 1978 when Bob Forsch of the St. Louis Cardinals pitched the first of his two no-hitters, a 5-0 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies. Weyer was widely regarded as having one of the overall largest strike zones in baseball, which was partially attributed to his large size at 6'6\\"; when teaching umpiring, he stated, \\"Don't be afraid to call strikes. A big strike zone gets the hitters swinging, making for more outs and a quicker game.\\" He often liked to dig trenches on either side of home plate to expose the black edge portions, which are often borderline pitches between balls and strikes. He wore uniform number 23 when the NL adopted uniform numbers in the 1960s, and was the only umpire to wear a white chest protector, which was prominent because he almost always wore his crested NL blazer when calling balls and strikes, even on hotter days. In 1980, after a spring training episode of bronchitis, Weyer was diagnosed as having Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome, a potentially life-threatening disorder which can affect muscle control and even cause blindness. He rebounded after suffering from blurred vision, returning to the field in late August, and also returned from a bout with diabetes in 1982. Personal life Weyer resided in Imlay City until 1969, when he relocated to the Atlanta area; he later moved to Los Angeles in 1977 and to Lauderdale Lakes, Florida in 1985. He married Gay Valentine Clem on November 2, 1963, divorcing approximately ten years later, which he mainly attributed to her difficulty in adjusting to his umpiring career. The split was so amicable, however, she agreed to continue doing his laundry for as long as he lived in Atlanta, which she did even after she remarried. Death He suffered a massive heart attack on July 4, 1988 at the San Mateo, California home of fellow umpire Ed Montague while playing basketball with Montague's children. He was taken by paramedics to Mills Hospital in San Mateo where he was pronounced dead at age 51. Weyer and Montague, close friends who had partnered on quite a popular amateur magic act, had umpired in that afternoon's game between the San Francisco Giants and Chicago Cubs, Weyer at first base. Weyer's father had died of a heart attack at age 53, and a brother had died of a heart attack at age 52. At the time of his death Weyer was engaged to be married to Linda Hickey, a resident of Long Island, New York. He was buried in Imlay Cemetery in his hometown.

He was born in Baltimore, Maryland. He umpired in the World Series in 1973, 1980, 1986, 1991 and 1995, serving as crew chief in 1980 and 1995. He also officiated in seven National League Championship Series (1970, 1972, 1977, 1981, 1982, 1988, 1990) and four All-Star games (1968, 1976, 1983, 1992), calling balls and strikes in 1976. He umpired in the National League Division Series in 1995, 1996 and 1997. He wore uniform number 21. Major League Baseball career Wendelstedt called balls and strikes in five no-hitters, tying an NL record held by Bill Klem. As a home plate umpire, Wendelstedt was known for keeping a wide strike zone. When a batter struck out swinging, he flailed his right arm straight up in the air. When a batter struck out looking, he applied the notorious \\"chainsaw\\" move. On May 31, 1968, Wendelstedt made a call that preserved Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Don Drysdale's consecutive shutouts and scoreless innings streaks. Giants catcher Dick Dietz came to the plate in the top of the 9th inning with the bases loaded and no outs. On a 2‚Äì2 count, Drysdale hit Dietz on the elbow, apparently forcing in a run that would have ended the streaks. However, Wendelstedt ruled that Dietz made no attempt to avoid being struck by the pitch, and called him back. Drysdale retired Dietz on a short fly ball and got out of the inning without yielding a run, earning his fifth straight shutout. On October 8, 1988, in Game 3 of the 1988 National League Championship Series, Wendelstedt ejected Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Jay Howell from the game for having pine tar in his glove. Mets manager Davey Johnson asked the umpires to check Howell, and Wendelstedt, the crew chief, ejected Howell after finding pine tar in his glove. Howell was later suspended for the rest of the series. Wendelstedt's son, Harry Hunter Wendelstedt III, followed in his father's footsteps and is a current major league umpire. The younger Wendelstedt goes by his middle name of \\"Hunter\\" professionally. To honor his father, Hunter also wears uniform number 21. Umpire training In 1977, Wendelstedt took over control of the Al Somers Umpire School from its founder (who had trained Wendelstedt), renaming it the Harry Wendelstedt Umpire School. He ran the school until his death and it continues to bear his name. His son Hunter now leads the school, located in Ormond Beach, Florida.Harry Wendelstedt Umpire School Program History Harry Wendelstedt Umpire School Death Harry Wendelstedt died at the age of 73 on March 9, 2012, after suffering from brain cancer for several years.Longtime umpire Harry Wendelstedt dies at 73 MLB.comLongtim umpire Harry Wendelstedt dies Sports Illustrated See also * List of Major League Baseball umpires ReferencesExternal links * Retrosheet * Harry Wendelstedt School for Umpires * BaseballLibrary - list of articles * Legacy.com obituary * * The Sporting News umpire card Category:1938 births Category:2012 deaths Category:Deaths from cancer in Florida Category:Deaths from brain tumor Category:Major League Baseball umpires Category:Sportspeople from Baltimore Category:People from Ormond Beach, Florida ","title":"Harry Wendelstedt"},{"id":"2752010","text":"Umpires Billy Evans, O'Loughlin, Bill Klem, and Jim Johnstone in 1909. Francis H. \\"Silk\\" O'Loughlin (August 15, 1872 - December 20, 1918) was an American umpire in Major League Baseball who worked in the American League from 1902 to 1918. He umpired in the World Series in 1906, 1909, 1912, 1915 and 1917, serving as crew chief in 1917. Early life Born in Rochester, New York, O'Loughlin was one of six children. His father died when he was five years old. He entered baseball with the help of pitcher Stump Wiedman, a relative, and umpired in the New York, Atlantic and Eastern Leagues from 1898 to 1901. O'Loughlin may have acquired his nickname as a child when neighbors commented on the fine quality of his hair. However, at least one source describes the nickname coming much later when players saw him wearing a silk hat. Major league careerDistinctive style= Silk came to the American League in 1902. He brought a unique style with him, originating the loud exclamations signaling balls, strikes and outs. Previously, umpires had simply informed the catcher or nearest defensive player of their calls. He was particularly known for his booming call of \\"ball tuh\\" and his drawn-out strike calls, as well as his snappy calls of foul balls. A 1909 New York Times article criticized the quiet work of umpire Billy Evans, saying, \\"Though they laugh at Silk O‚ÄôLoughlin, everybody knows just what he says.\\" Years later, Evans himself would remark, \\"Silk was a bundle of nerves. From the start of the game until the finish he was on edge. Baseball was a serious proposition for him.\\" Perceptions differ as to O'Loughlin's tolerance for disagreements. In 1911 he said, \\"I wouldn't give a snap for a player who wouldn't kick if he honestly thought he was right. Umpires have to stand the brunt of kicks, but if the player is one of the kind who is always thinking of winning and makes his kick and walks away, I don't mind it.\\" However, the following year Christy Mathewson wrote that O'Loughlin was \\"the autocrat of baseball\\" and that he \\"refuses to let the players discuss a decision with him, maintaining that there is never any room for argument. If a man makes any talk with him, it is quick to the shower bath.\\" Silk agreed with at least part of that statement. He was frequently quoted as saying, \\"A man is always out or safe, or it is a ball or a strike, and the umpire, if he is a good man and knows his business, is always right.\\" O'Loughlin's physical presentation was unique among his contemporaries. He wore creased pants and players joked about risking injury from the sharp creases if they slid near him. He also sported a large diamond on his hand while on the field. A 1907 Coca-Cola ad featured Silk making a strike call. =Hand signals= Though well known for his voice, O'Loughlin also began using \\"Dummy Hoy's mute signal code\\" to indicate the calls visually after he \\"sprained his larynx\\" in a confrontation. The rules committee ultimately opted against formal adoption, but O'Loughlin continued to use his signals and to improve upon them. =Notable games= O'Loughlin umpired in a record ten no-hitters during his brief career, a mark not broken until 2001. He was behind the plate for seven of the ten. He was the base umpire for Addie Joss' perfect game on October 2, 1908. On July 29, 1911, he became the last major league umpire to work a no-hitter singlehandedly when he called Smoky Joe Wood's gem. O'Loughlin is well remembered for a call during the 1907 pennant race that went against Connie Mack's Athletics in a game against Detroit. The call concerned possible interference by a policeman with a Detroit defender. It appears that O'Loughlin did not initially note any interference, but after conferring with fellow umpire Tommy Connolly, the Athletics batter was called out. Mack angrily protested, later going so far as to send affidavits from nearby fans and the policeman to league president Ban Johnson. The game was ultimately called a tie on account of darkness after seventeen innings and the second game of the scheduled doubleheader was postponed. Though Mack's team would finish 1 1/2 games out of first place, Mack would still blame O'Loughlin for the loss of the pennant more than forty years later. Silk was the first umpire to eject Ty Cobb from a major league game. The year was 1908, Cobb's fourth season in the majors. The early part of the 1912 season was particularly eventful for O'Loughlin. On May 11, 1912, Silk was the target of glass bottles thrown by fans of the beleaguered New York Highlanders. O'Loughlin angered fans by ejecting catcher Gabby Street, pitcher Jack Quinn and manager Harry Wolverton for arguing balls and strikes. Just four days later, O'Loughlin ejected Ty Cobb after the slugger severely beat a disabled fan who was thought to have thrown a racial slur at Cobb. The incident raised concerns about player protection from heckling fans and it nearly precipitated a player strike. Outside of baseball In 1904, O'Loughlin ran unsuccessfully for New York State Assembly. O'Loughlin, running on the Democratic ticket, was badly beaten. He would later say, \\"I think that the public made a rotten decision.\\" O'Loughlin worked for the Justice Department in the Boston District from the end of the 1918 season until his death less than four months later. Death O'Loughlin contracted influenza during the 1918 epidemic that shortened the baseball season. Within a few days, he developed double pneumonia and died at his Boston home. He was 46 years old. O'Loughlin's wife had fallen ill with influenza around the same time, but she recovered.1918 FLU PANDEMIC DID NOT SPARE BASEBALL National Baseball Hall of Fame  See also  * Honor Rolls of Baseball * List of Major League Baseball umpires ReferencesExternal links *Society for American Baseball Research *BaseballLibrary.com - career highlights *The Sporting News - photo and biography *Retrosheet Category:1872 births Category:1918 deaths Category:Deaths from Spanish flu Category:Infectious disease deaths in Massachusetts Category:Sportspeople from Rochester, New York Category:Sportspeople from Boston Category:Major League Baseball umpires ","title":"Silk O'Loughlin"},{"id":"2752022","text":"Larry Sanders McCoy (born May 19, 1941 in Essex, Missouri) is a former umpire in Major League Baseball who worked in the American League from 1970 to 1999.

Born in Guelph, Ontario, Canada, Emslie had a brief professional playing career with the Baltimore and Philadelphia clubs in the American Association. His professional umpiring career began in 1888, and after spending a couple of seasons in the minor leagues, he was promoted to the major leagues as an umpire in 1890. Emslie was nicknamed \\"Wig\\" due to his premature receding hairline, which was a result of the stress of umpiring games single-handedly in the rough-and-tumble 1890s; he was derisively called \\"Blind Bob\\" by the New York Giants following his role in the infamous \\"Merkle's Boner\\" play during the National League pennant race. The play involved a force out when a Giants player stopped running to second base upon seeing that the game's winning run would score. When \\"Merkle's boner\\" occurred, Emslie had already worked more major league games than any umpire in MLB history, then later served as the National League's chief of umpires upon retiring from active umpiring. He retired to St. Thomas, Ontario and died there on Monday, April 26, 1943. In 1946 he was included in the Honor Rolls of Baseball and in 1986 he was named to the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame. Playing career Emslie began his professional career playing for several semi-professional teams in Ontario until signing on with the Camden, New Jersey team of an early version of the Interstate League for the season. He pitched for them until middle of the season when he joined the Baltimore Orioles of the American Association. The first season with the Orioles, he had a 9‚Äì13 record, with 3.17 earned run average (ERA), 21 complete games, and one shutout. His best season was in , when he had a 32‚Äì17 record, completed all 50 of his starts, and had a 2.75 ERA. In , Emslie's numbers greatly decreased with Baltimore, reportedly due to a sore arm, attributed to his excessive use of the curveball, at which he was moved to the Philadelphia Athletics also of the American Association. He pitched in only four games for the Athletics; his major league playing career was over, and by his minor league career was through as well. Umpiring career After his playing career finished he was attending an International League game and was asked to officiate this game between Toronto and Hamilton when the assigned umpire fell ill. He umpired with the International League for the and seasons, then began his Major League Baseball career umpiring American Association games in . He began the season in the Western League, but was back in the majors by August 17, working for the National League. Emslie as an NL umpire in 1914 Emslie was involved in many of the game's highlights, including calling four no-hitters. The first one was on August 16, 1893, when Bill Hawke of the Orioles tossed his; the second was Deacon Phillippe's of the Louisville Colonels on May 25, 1899. The third no-hitter came on September 18, 1903 by Chick Fraser of the Philadelphia Phillies, and the fourth was tossed on May 8, 1907, by Francis \\"Big Jeff\\" Pfeffer of the Boston Doves. He also officiated on July 13, 1896 when Ed Delahanty become only the second player to hit four home runs in one game. By the end of the season, he began to work the bases almost exclusively instead of calling games from behind the plate. In all, Emslie umpired for 33 years before retiring at the end of the season, after which he then served as NL chief of umpires, with the responsibilities of inspecting, scouting, and coaching new umpires. =The Merkle incident= Emslie was the base umpire on September 23, 1908, when controversy erupted at the end of the New York Giants-Chicago Cubs game at the Polo Grounds. With the score tied and two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning, the Giants had Moose McCormick on third base and Fred Merkle on first base; Al Bridwell smashed a single to center to drive home McCormick with the apparent winning run, but Merkle failed to touch second base. Cubs second baseman Johnny Evers noticed this error, and tagged second base and appealed to Emslie. Emslie claimed that he had to duck out of the way of Bridwell's line drive and did not see the play, and home plate umpire Hank O'Day declared Merkle out and the game a tie. New York manager John McGraw, with whom Bob had a long and tempestuous history, bestowed upon Emslie his nickname \\"Blind Bob\\" after the controversy. The incident is often referred to as \\"Merkle's Boner.\\" Notably, Emslie and O'Day were the two most experienced umpires in Major League Baseball history at that point, with Emslie having worked nearly 2,500 games and O'Day nearly 1,700. Later, Emslie showed up at a Giants' practice with a rifle, placed a dime on the pitching mound and shot it from behind home plate, sending the coin spinning into the outfield. Reportedly, McGraw never again challenged his eyesight. =Other Activities= Emslie was also president of the Canadian Grand International Trap Shoot, notably in charge of a large meet in St. Thomas, Ontario in December 1916. Post-career He retired to St. Thomas, Ontario, where he coached youth baseball and enjoyed curling, bowling, and golf. Emslie died at age 84 in St. Thomas, Ontario, and was interred at the St. Thomas West Avenue Cemetery. He was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in . Emslie Field in St. Thomas is named in his honor.

Highly regarded for his ability, he was also known for his inclination to eject players and managers quickly and dramatically. He was on the cover of the first issue of Sports Illustrated, with catcher Wes Westrum and batter Eddie Mathews, in August 1954. Life and career Known as Gus to those close with him, Donatelli was born in Heilwood, Pennsylvania and raised in Bakerton. After enjoying a 14-game career as a minor league infielder in , he served in the Army Air Forces' Eighth Air Force during World War II and spent 15 months as a German prisoner of war after flying 18 missions as a tailgunner on a B-17. His plane was shot down during the first daylight raid on Berlin, and he suffered a broken ankle upon parachuting. He began umpiring softball games while a POW before being freed when Soviet troops overran the area. After the war he opted for an umpiring career rather than return to the coal mines near his hometown, and after graduating from Bill McGowan's school in 1946 worked in the Pioneer League in 1946, the South Atlantic League in 1947, and the International League in 1948-49. During his major league career, he umpired in the World Series in 1955 (outfield only), 1957, 1961, 1967 and 1973. He also officiated in the National League Championship Series in 1969 and 1972, serving as crew chief for the latter series, and in the 3-game playoff series to determine the NL champion in both and . He umpired in the All-Star game in 1953, 1959 (first game), 1962 (first game) and 1969. When the National League umpires began wearing uniform numbers in 1970, Donatelli was assigned uniform number 7. Donatelli was involved in numerous other notable games. On September 20, 1969, working behind the plate for Bob Moose's 4-0 win, he officiated in his eighth official no-hitter, tying an NL record held by Bob Emslie and Frank Secory; after Secory extended the record to nine in 1970, Donatelli again tied it on September 2, 1972 when he worked first base in Milt Pappas' 8-0 gem.Coberly, p. 160. Tom Gorman also tied the record in 1976 before Paul Pryor worked in his 10th no-hitter in . Donatelli called balls and strikes for four of his nine no-hitters, including Warren Spahn's second no-hitter on April 28, 1961,Coberly, p. 116. and Ken Johnson's game of April 23, 1964 in which he became the first pitcher in history to lose a nine-inning no-hitter, by a score of 1-0.Coberly, p. 125. (disputed) In Game 4 of the 1957 World Series, he awarded Milwaukee Braves pinch-hitter Nippy Jones first base in the 10th inning after determining that there was shoe polish on the ball, showing that Jones had been hit; a pinch runner scored the game-tying run, and the Braves went on to win both the game and the series. Donatelli was noted for having perhaps the most dramatic ejection gesture in baseball. In a game between the New York Giants and St. Louis Cardinals, Donatelli ejected the Giants' Bob Elliott for arguing a called strike two, then ejected Elliott's replacement Bobby Hofman for disputing a called third strike. He was part of the crew on May 2, 1954, when Stan Musial hit five home runs in a doubleheader; he was behind the plate in the first game, when Musial hit three of the five. He was also in the umpiring crew for the May 30, 1956 doubleheader between the Braves and Chicago Cubs, in which the teams combined for a record 15 home runs; the Braves' Bobby Thomson hit a pair in each game, and Hank Aaron and Eddie Mathews each homered in both contests as well.Dittmar, pp. 116-120. He also umpired in the April 30, 1961 game in which Willie Mays hit four home runs.Dittmar, pp. 132-134. Donatelli is widely regarded as having been a primary force in the creation of the first umpires' union, the Major League Umpires Association, in 1964. He lost his position as crew chief immediately afterward, though NL president Warren Giles denied that Donatelli's involvement with the union was the cause. Following Game 7 of the 1967 World Series, Donatelli was seen running off the field from his position at third base with the hats of two members of the victorious St. Louis Cardinals in his hands. The picture was picked up by the Associated Press and ran in newspapers from coast to coast the next day. His final game behind the plate came in Game 2 of the 1973 World Series between the New York Mets and Oakland Athletics. Donatelli was involved in a controversial play when he called the Mets' Bud Harrelson out when he tried to score from third base on a fly ball by F√©lix Mill√°n in the top of the 10th inning with the score tied at 6-6. Replays showed that Harrelson avoided the tag of Athletics catcher Ray Fosse. Willie Mays, playing in his final season in baseball, pleaded his case in front of Donatelli, and soon the argument was joined by Mets manager Yogi Berra and Harrelson.

Career Brinkman‚Äòs 35 years of umpiring AL games surpassed the record set by Larry Barnett (1968‚Äì1999). Brinkman is fifth all time in number of games worked in the Major Leagues. Three of the four ahead of him are in the Hall of Fame. Brinkman umpired in three World Series: 1978, 1986, 1995. He officiated in three American League Championship Series (1976, 1980, 1987, 1992, 1997), and in three All-Star games (1977, 1991, 1996), calling balls and strikes in 1991. Brinkman worked the Division Series in 1981, 1995, 1998, 1999, 2004 and 2005. He also officiated in A. J. Burnett's no-hitter against the San Diego Padres on May 12, 2001. Brinkman served as the crew chief for the ALCS in 1987 and 1997, and also for the 2005 NLDS. His retirement was announced on August 22, 2006. Former umpire Bob Davidson returned to replace Brinkman on the major league roster. He worked home plate for the final game at Comiskey Park in 1990. =Pine tar game= Brinkman was also the crew chief during the Pine Tar Incident between the Kansas City Royals and New York Yankees on July 24, . In that game, George Brett of the Royals hit a two-run home run off of Yankees reliever Goose Gossage in the ninth inning, but home plate umpire Tim McClelland, after conferring with Brinkman and the rest of the crew, found that the pine tar on Brett's bat exceeded the allowed limit of 18 inches, and Brett was called out. Brett immediately ran out of the dugout toward the umpires, and disputed the call so vehemently that Brinkman had to grab him around the neck to keep him from attacking McClelland. Brinkman recovered Brett's bat, having caught a batboy attempting to hide it in the Royals' clubhouse. American League president Lee MacPhail later overturned the umpires' ruling upon a protest by the Royals, and the home run was restored. However, when the game was resumed on August 18, Brinkman and his crew were not present. He had provided an affidavit stating that Brett and baserunner U. L. Washington had touched all the bases, anticipating appeal plays by Yankees manager Billy Martin to state that the runners missed at least one base. Dave Phillips, the crew chief of the umpiring crew that was at Yankee Stadium when the game resumed, showed Martin a copy of the affidavit. =Uniform and number= Brinkman wore uniform number 15 from the year the AL adopted uniform numbers in 1980, and kept the number when MLB took over supervision of a combined umpiring staff in 2000. He was one of the last active umpires to have worn the red blazers that were part of the AL's umpiring uniforms from 1973 through 1979. (Derryl Cousins was the last remaining umpire to have worn the blazer; he retired in 2012.) Brinkman likened the red coats to making AL umpires look like \\"a bunch of Captain Kangaroos\\" in cold weather. When Brinkman retired, he was the last active umpire to have used the outside chest protector, which was required for AL umpires through the 1974 season. The league made new umpires wear the inside chest protector starting in 1977. Brinkman was not the last umpire to wear the \\"balloon\\" protector, having switched to the inside protector in 1980. Bill Kunkel and Jerry Neudecker were the last umpires to use the \\"balloon\\" protector. Neither made the switch, with Kunkel succumbing to cancer early in the 1985 season, and Neudecker retiring after the 1985 season. Brinkman was the last active umpire to have worked in the American League prior to the establishment of the Designated Hitter for the 1973 season. He came up for three games late in the 1972 season, before joining the AL staff full-time in 1973. Brinkman ran the Joe Brinkman Umpire's School, which he had purchased from retired Major League Umpire Bill Kinnamon. Brinkman sold this to fellow AL umpire Jim Evans in the late 1990s. Brinkman was prominent in union affairs for both the Major League Umpire's Association and the newly formed World Umpire's Association (having served as the organization‚Äôs first Vice President). Brinkman was the left field umpire for Game 5 of the 1995 American League Division Series between the Seattle Mariners and the New York Yankees, meaning he was the umpire who officially ruled Edgar Martinez's famous double a fair ball. Brinkman was also the home plate umpire for Game 6 of the 1995 World Series between the Cleveland Indians and the Atlanta Braves. Personal For several years Brinkman operated the Joe Brinkman Umpire's School in Cocoa, Florida, and has worked at several baseball camps and clinics over the years. He was raised in Holdingford, Minnesota, and graduated from Holdingford High School.

Done as a pastiche of the Rock Hudson-Doris Day romantic comedy films, Straight-Jacket tells the story of Guy Stone, a closeted gay actor in the 1950s who is modeled on Hudson. Plot Guy Stone (Matt Letscher) is blissfully closeted, picking up tricks for one-night-stands, while capturing the country's heart as \\"America's most eligible bachelor\\" (starring in such films as The Love Barrel and I Married the Ghost). However, Guy's carefully managed fa√ßade collapses when he comes up for the lead in S.R.O. studio's version of Ben-Hur. Things turn sour for the film idol when a fellow actor, Freddie Stevens (Jack Plotnick) (famous in the film for portraying \\"Captain Astro\\" in a succession of Buck Rogers or Flash Gordon-type serial films), decides to steal the lead in Ben-Hur from Guy by taking a picture of Guy exiting a gay bar. Freddie plans to out Guy to the world and ruin his career. Jerry (Veronica Cartwright), Guy's repressed lesbian ball- bustingly ambitious agent, connives to cover up the impending outing and ensure Guy the role in Ben-Hur by marrying her client off with great fanfare to the studio head's secretary, Sally (Carrie Preston), who just happens to also be a slavishly devoted Guy Stone fan. However, Sally isn't aware the marriage is a sham. To avoid his adoring new bride as much as possible, Guy has Jerry sign him onto the next available film, which turns out to be 'Blood Mine' ‚Äî a disastrously arch pro-union film about the corrupt goings on at a coal mine (with lines like 'how can they call this a MINE when everything is THEIRS!?!'). The studio head, in fear of the red-baiting going on in Hollywood at the time, decides ‚Äî true to Hollywood stereotype ‚Äî rather than stop production on the film to instead water down the pro-union content wherever possible. The young, idealistic, and terribly handsome writer of the novel that the film is based on, Rick Foster, quickly gets roped into convoluting the plot of this already-bad adaptation of his heartfelt book largely because of a chance meeting between him and the film's star, Guy. The attraction the two men feel for one another is instantaneous and propels the rest of the plot forward.

He is perhaps well remembered for a controversial call in Game 3 of the 1975 World Series while working home plate in the 10th inning that led to the Reds winning the game. He was also the home plate umpire for the infamous Jeffrey Maier game, but did not have anything to do with the controversy.

Fisk committed a throwing error on the play after colliding with Armbrister, which led to the Reds' winning run. Barnett declined to make an interference call on Armbrister, despite Boston's pleas. Barnett's failure to call an interference was criticized by NBC television broadcaster Curt Gowdy (a former Red Sox announcer), who was particularly harsh in his comments, reputedly leading NBC to drop Gowdy from its baseball coverage.https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/21/sports/othersports/21gowdy.html?_r=0 Gowdy had been given the correct interpretation by NBC Radio Producer Jay Scott (who was a Triple-A fill-in umpire at the time as well), but did not use it.Powers, Jim, \\"Mt Broadcaster Had Role In Gowdy Fall\\" Montana Sportsfan Magazine, Billings MT Barnett later claimed he had received death threats on account of Gowdy's criticism.Gowdy answers umpire's charges The Morning Record. Retrieved 11 June 2012 Major League Baseball continues to this day to maintain that Barnett made the correct call. In fact, the Professional Baseball Umpires Corporation (the organization that oversees all minor league baseball umpires) instructs and teaches its umpires to make the same call as Barnett did should the same incident occur in a future game. Specifically, Major League Baseball has interpreted Rule 7.09(l) as saying \\"a catcher trying to field a batted ball that remains in the immediate vicinity of the plate cannot be protected because of the right of the batter-runner to begin his advance to first. Barring an intentional action on the part of either player, contact in this instance is incidental, and is not interference...\\" (Jaksa/Roder Umpires' Manual, 1997 Edition. Pg. 57). Prior to Game 2 of the 1986 World Series, NBC did a feature on replays narrated by Bob Costas. One of the plays cited by Costas was the Armbrister play, and Barnett and Costas both insisted that Barnett had made the correct call, although Barnett declared, \\"You won't find many people in Boston who believe it was the right call.\\" Costas used the feature to condemn the suggested notion of instant replay to settle calls, noting that it was the \\"same kind of mentality that adds color to classic movies and calls it progress.\\" =Game 1 of the 1996 ALCS= Barnett was also behind the plate for Game 1 of the 1996 American League Championship Series, better known as the Jeffrey Maier game after the 11-year- old spectator who reached over the right field fence to catch Derek Jeter's fly ball.

He was one of the main proponents of enlightened absolutism among the Brunswick dukes. Life He was born in Hitzacker, then the residence of his father Duke Augustus the Younger of Brunswick-L√ºneburg (1579‚Äì1666) and his second wife Princess Dorothea of Anhalt-Zerbst (1607‚Äì1634). The next year his father, at the age of 55, assumed the rule in the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel after his Welf cousin Duke Frederick Ulrich had died childless. =Early years= Young Prince Anthony Ulrich Anthony Ulrich was the second surviving son of the ducal couple; he and his siblings received a comprehensive education at the Wolfenb√ºttel court by scholars like Justus Georg Schottel and Sigmund von Birken, as well as by his art-minded stepmother Elisabeth Sophie of Mecklenburg (1613‚Äì1676). Anthony Ulrich's sister was Sibylle Ursula von Braunschweig-L√ºneburg (1629-1671), who stood out as a writer and translator. He studied at the University of Helmstedt where he obtained a doctorate in theology. On his Grand Tour, he travelled to Italy and the Low Countries, he met with Madeleine de Scud√©ry and became passionate about theatre. When he married Elisabeth Juliane (1633-1704), daughter of Duke Frederick of Schleswig-Holstein-S√∏nderburg-Norburg, in 1656, he wrote a stage play on this occasion. =Co-ruler= Already his father consulted him in politics and the government business. After Augustus the Younger's death in 1666, Rudolph Augustus, Anthony Ulrich's elder brother, became reigning duke and made Anthony Ulrich his proxy. Rudolph Augustus had more interest in hunting and his library than in government affairs and left most decisions to his brother; in 1685, he officially made Anthony Ulrich a coregent with equal rights. The young prince united the forces of the Welf principalities to combat the rebellious City of Brunswick, whose citizens finally had to accept the ducal overlordship in 1671. In the following year, however, his main concern was the rivalry with his cousin Duke Ernest Augustus, who from 1679 ruled over the Brunswick Principality of Calenberg. Duke Anthony Ulrich, portrait by Hyacinthe Rigaud After the Ernest Augustus had received the new ninth prince- electorship from Emperor Leopold I in 1692 and went on to rule as Elector of Hanover, tensions between the two states rose, as both Anthony Ulrich and Rudolph Augustus were dismayed that they had not received the electorship according to the right of primogeniture. While both Hanover under Ernest Augustus' son Elector George Louis and the Welf Principality of L√ºneburg sided with the Habsburg emperor in the War of the Spanish Succession, Anthony Ulrich decided to enter into an agreement with King Louis XIV of France. This led to Hanover and L√ºneburg forces invading the Principality of Wolfenb√ºttel in March 1702; Anthony Ulrich was almost captured while travelling from his Wolfenb√ºttel residence to Brunswick. By order of the emperor, Anthony Ulrich was deposed as duke against his brother's protestations, and Rudolph Augustus remained as the only Wolfenb√ºttel ruler, while Anthony Ulrich fled to Saxe- Gotha. In April 1702, Rudolph Augustus signed a treaty with Hanover and L√ºneburg that Anthony Ulrich later agreed to. =Sole ruler= After Rudolph Augustus' death in 1704, Anthony Ulrich took over government again. He continued to settle various disputes with his Hanover cousin George Louis, who in 1705 also inherited L√ºneburg, until a final agreement between the two sister principalities was reached in 1706. Wolfenb√ºttel also renounced all claims to the former Ascanian duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg and received several smaller estates in compensation. It was now Anthony Ulrich's turn to approach the Imperial Habsburg dynasty. In 1704, he had concluded an agreement with his cousin Wilhelmine Amalia of Brunswick-L√ºneburg, wife of the future Emperor Joseph I, to marry his granddaughter Elisabeth Christine off to Joseph's brother Archduke Charles of Austria. The young woman was reluctant to convert to the Catholic faith, which she finally did in a solemn ceremony at Bamberg Cathedral on 1 May 1707. The marriage took place the next year in Vienna. In 1709, Anthony Ulrich himself converted to the Catholic Church. He guaranteed to his subjects that this would not influence his government, although he allowed the consecration of the first Catholic church in Brunswick. He lived to see the election of Archduke Charles as Emperor Charles VI in 1711 and also the marriage of his granddaughter Charlotte Christine with Alexei Petrovich Romanov, son of Tsar Peter I, in the same year. He died at the age of 80 at his Schloss Salzdahlum residence, which he had built, and was buried in the crypt of the Wolfenb√ºttel Marienkirche. He was succeeded by his eldest surviving son, Augustus William. Patron of the arts Schloss Salzdahlum (demolished in 1813) As an admirer of King Louis XIV of France, Anthony Ulrich is known as a supporter of scholarship and the arts. He introduced the French language at the Wolfenb√ºttel court and often spent enormous sums on cultural events and amusements. From 1689 to 1690, he had a public opera house erected in Brunswick, Staatstheater Braunschweig, which soon became a venue for Baroque composers such as Johann Rosenm√ºller, Johann Sigismund Kusser, Reinhard Keiser, Georg Caspar Sch√ºrmann, and Johann Adolph Hasse. He significantly extended the Bibliotheca Augusta, a library founded by his father. He hired the philosopher Leibniz as a librarian, and was a supporter of Anton Wilhelm Amo, the first black Doctor of Philosophy in Europe. The new rotunda of the Bibliotheca Augusta, built according to plans by Hermann Korb and completed in 1712, was the first genuine library building in Germany. Hermann Korb also designed the plans for Schloss Salzdahlum which was erected between 1694 and 1695, modelled on the French Ch√¢teau de Marly. Here the Prussian crown prince Frederick II married Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick- Wolfenb√ºttel-Bevern in 1733. Anthony Ulrich also was a writer and had a large art collection, which later became the foundation of the Herzog Anton Ulrich Museum (Duke Anthony Ulrich Museum). His sister Sibylle Ursula wrote part of a novel, Die Durchlauchtige Syrerin Aramena (Aramena, the noble Syrian lady), which when complete would be the most famous courtly novel in German Baroque literature; it was finished by Anthony Ulrich and edited by Sigmund von Birken. Marriage and children Anthony Ulrich married Elizabeth Juliana, daughter of Frederick, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-S√∏nderburg-Nordborg, in 1656. They had the following children who reached adulthood: * Augustus Frederick (1657‚Äì1676) * Elizabeth Eleanore Sophie (1658‚Äì1729), married John George, Duke of Mecklenburg-Mirow and Bernhard I, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen * Anne Sophie (1659‚Äì1742), married Charles Gustav of Baden-Durlach * Augustus William (1662‚Äì1731) * Augusta Dorothea (1666‚Äì1751), married Anton G√ºnther II, Count of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen-Arnstadt * Henrietta Christine, Abbess of Gandersheim (1669‚Äì1753) * Louis Rudolph (1671‚Äì1735) AncestryNovels * Die Durchlauchtige Syrerin Aramena (Aramena, the noble Syrian lady; 1669‚Äì1673) * Die R√∂mische Octavia (Octavia the Roman; 1677‚Äì1707) References * Anthony Ulrich at the House of Welf site (in German) * Anthony Ulrich at Pierre Marteau's Publishing House, including entry from Zedler's Universal-Lexicon, 1732 (in German) Category:1633 births Category:1714 deaths Category:People from Hitzacker Category:Princes of Wolfenb√ºttel Category:German art collectors Category:18th-century art collectors Category:17th-century German novelists Category:18th-century German novelists Category:University of Helmstedt alumni Category:Converts to Roman Catholicism from Lutheranism Category:German male novelists Category:New House of Brunswick Category:17th-century German writers ","title":"Anthony Ulrich, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel"},{"id":"2752088","text":"The term Fancy Dutch or Gay Dutch refers to the Pennsylvania Germans who do not belong to the Anabaptist churches.

(1970) Section 5.7 The distributions of random variables having this property are said to be \\"stable distributions\\". Results available in probability theory show that all possible distributions having this property are members of a four-parameter family of distributions. The article on the stable distribution describes this family together with some of the properties of these distributions. The importance in probability theory of \\"stability\\" and of the stable family of probability distributions is that they are \\"attractors\\" for properly normed sums of independent and identically distributed random variables. Important special cases of stable distributions are the normal distribution, the Cauchy distribution and the L√©vy distribution. For details see stable distribution. Definition There are several basic definitions for what is meant by stability. Some are based on summations of random variables and others on properties of characteristic functions. =Definition via distribution functions= FellerFeller (1971), Section VI.1 makes the following basic definition. A random variable X is called stable (has a stable distribution) if, for n independent copies Xi of X, there exist constants cn > 0 and dn such that :X_1+X_2+\\\\ldots+X_n \\\\stackrel{d}{=} c_n X+d_n , where this equality refers to equality of distributions. A conclusion drawn from this starting point is that the sequence of constants cn must be of the form :c_n = n^{1/\\\\alpha} \\\\, for 0 < \\\\alpha \\\\leq 2 . A further conclusion is that it is enough for the above distributional identity to hold for n=2 and n=3 only.Feller (1971), Problem VI.13.3 Stability in probability theory There are a number of mathematical results that can be derived for distributions which have the stability property. That is, all possible families of distributions which have the property of being closed under convolution are being considered.Lukacs, E. (1970) Section 5.7 It is convenient here to call these stable distributions, without meaning specifically the distribution described in the article named stable distribution, or to say that a distribution is stable if it is assumed that it has the stability property. The following results can be obtained for univariate distributions which are stable. * Stable distributions are always infinitely divisible.Lukacs, E. (1970) Theorem 5.7.1 * All stable distributions are absolutely continuous.Lukacs, E. (1970) Theorem 5.8.1 * All stable distributions are unimodal.Lukacs, E. (1970) Theorem 5.10.1 Other types of stability The above concept of stability is based on the idea of a class of distributions being closed under a given set of operations on random variables, where the operation is \\"summation\\" or \\"averaging\\". Other operations that have been considered include: *geometric stability: here the operation is to take the sum of a random number of random variables, where the number has a geometric distribution.Klebanov et al. (1984) The counterpart of the stable distribution in this case is the geometric stable distribution *Max-stability: here the operation is to take the maximum of a number of random variables. The counterpart of the stable distribution in this case is the generalized extreme value distribution, and the theory for this case is dealt with as extreme value theory.

The game had a limited release in North America, and unlike the series' previous episodes, was not published in Europe. This is the last game in the series to take place on Tokyo's vast highway system. The later games for PlayStation 2 were Tokyo Xtreme Racer: Drift (prequel) and Tokyo Xtreme Racer: Drift 2 (sequel). Each of these games took place in the mountains of Japan. Story 2 years after the events of Shutokou Battle 0 (and sometime after the events of Kaido Battle), the news of the 13 Devils' defeat has been communicated through all of Japan. Tokyo is plunged into chaos and now 2 more cities want to compete: Osaka and Nagoya. The racers here will have to beat every team in these 3 cities, and maybe, have the opportunity to challenge the best drivers in each: Speed King & Dejected Angel in Tokyo, Seeks, Genesis R & D3 in Nagoya and No Loser & Darts in Osaka. Final Bosses Tokyo : 1st level : \\\\- Setsuko Kuroe, aka Dejected Angel : Former member of the 13 Devils, she used to drove a white S14, but was defeated by a wanderer racer 2 years ago. After that, she now drives a Silvia S15 and has returned as an even fiercer opponent. 2nd level \\\\- Motoya Iwasaki, the Speed King/Jintei : Former leader of the 13 Devils (13 Military Ogres in US version), he was the best driver on the highway. But he lost to an unknown driver 2 years ago (see Shutokou Battle 0) and rumor said that he left the highway forever. Driving his blue Skyline GT-R R34, he returned with increased power and is faster than ever. (Note : If in the game, Iwasaki's car has Ablfug's rear bumper and C-West's front bumper and rear spoiler, the cinematic after beating him shows us a blue MCR Skyline GT-R with Speed King's license plate and vinyls.) Nagoya : 1st level : \\\\- Nobuhiro Oda, aka Darkness Seven : He has had a long career as a racer, having raced since graduating high school. Driving a black Lexus GS300, he is both a rival and a comrade with Seeks' leader, Yota Takino and they join forces to fight a common enemy. \\\\- Yota Takino, aka Ogre Deity : Seeks' leader with ambition. Therefore, he doesn't hesitate to say rough things to his team members. Driving a brown Toyota Supra, he is a both rival and a comrade with Genesis R's leader, Nobuhiro Oda and will join forces with him if necessary. 2nd level : \\\\- Hiroaki Sakabura, The Rook : One of the members of Nagoya's strongest racing posse D3. There are many true believers of his complete racing method. He has scrutinized parts in his grey Toyota Supra and doesn't allow for any margin of error. \\\\- Shinichiro Kanatani, The Bishop : One of the members of Nagoya's most powerful racing posse D3. His machine, a white Toyota Supra, on whose settings he has labored tirelessly, is sometimes referred to as \\"a racing work of art\\". \\\\- Keita Arai, The Knight : One of the members of Nagoya's strongest racing posse D3. A former detective, he now works in private investigation. Even amongst D3, he has an outstanding technique when he drives his black Supra. Osaka : 1st level : \\\\- Toshifumi Asakawa, aka Naniwa's Warship : Leader of the No Loser, he believes that the mechanism of the vehicle is the most important thing : in other words, if the vehicle is complete, which is the case for his Lancer Evolution V, the driver's skill doesn't matter. 2nd level : \\\\- Noboru Kawajiri, aka God's Estuary : Leader of the Darts in his Ford GT Concept, he was formally provided with the team sticker after systematically battling over 70 members of his team. He only races against opponents who have recognized capabilities. Bonus : Unknown : Unknown is the final boss of the game and appears only if you have defeated EVERY rivals. He's not ??? for his car isn't the Devil Z, but the player's ghost car, allowing him to not be slow down by the traffic or by the player. Gameplay The premise of the game is identical to the previous variants of the Tokyo Xtreme Racer series: the player cruises the highways of Japan at night, while challenging opponents to impromptu battles. When the race begins, each vehicle has a health meter which slowly drains if players' opponent is ahead of them or if they collide with walls, rails, or other vehicles. The race is over when one vehicle's health meter runs out no matter how long (time & distance) the race lasts. The race could also end prematurely if the player and the AI racer(s) drive in separate directions when the highway splits. This results in a draw. In the beginning of the game, the player will start with a small variety of \\"slow\\" cars. As the player races other rivals in the game, they can unlock the type of car being driven at the time to be used in standard cruise modes. There are over 80 cars from 15 different manufacturers, which include Japanese, American, and European cars. It is advisable to start the game with a vehicle that is more powerful; these vehicles have the greatest potential for use in the later, more difficult parts of the game, and it is entirely possible to clear the entire game using only one's starting car. The cars have a wide variety of tuning options, including body kits, engines, drive-train systems, rims, lighting, paint, and even a custom paint shop that can be utilized to create special designs. The player can own up to 5 personalized cars at a given time, which contain components that are all how the user wants them to be. The player will race against race gangs that have their own attitude and requirements, and compete against wanderers that do not belong to any individual group. These wanderers all have specific requirements to meet before they will race players, such as a certain day of the week. Weather conditions, modifications, and even which car the player is driving are all other examples of requirements. In the end there are a total of 600 rivals within a 2-stage story mode. The cities shown in the game include the capital Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka, with the most complex being Tokyo. The capital includes the inner city, the Wangan expressway, and Yokohama. Reception The game was met with mixed reception, as GameRankings gave it a score of 64.64%, while Metacritic gave it 63 out of 100. The North American version drew harsh criticism because of a currency conversion glitch that made it legitimately unbeatable. One of the rivals named \\"Whirlwind Fanfare\\", located in Osaka, requires the player to have 100,000,000 CR in order to race her. However, the counter stops at 99,999,990 CR, making her impossible to race without the use of a cheating device. The Japanese release of the game does not suffer this glitch. This was due to a programming currency error where the American version represents US Dollars and the Japanese version represents Yen.

(B3:JBSS3), a Brazilian company that is the world's largest processor of fresh beef and pork, with more than US$50 billion in annual sales as of 2017. The subsidiary was created when JBS entered the U.S. market in 2007 with its purchase of Swift & Company. JBS USA is based in Greeley, Colorado. Its competitors include Cargill, Smithfield Foods, and Tyson Foods. HistorySwift & Company= Swift meat packing plant in La Plata, Argentina, c. 1920 1916 advertisement for lard JBS USA's operations can be traced back to 1855, when 16-year-old Gustavus Franklin Swift founded a butchering operation in Eastham, Massachusetts. Its early origins on Cape Cod led to later Brighton, MA, Albany, NY, and Buffalo, NY locations, and in 1875 Swift and Company was incorporated in Chicago. Swift and Armour and Company acquired a two-thirds controlling interest in the Fort Worth Stockyards in 1902. That same year, an antitrust lawsuit was filed against Swift for conspiring with other companies to control the meatpacking industry. The companies attempted to merge to avoid the suit, leading to the 1905 Supreme Court case of Swift & Co. v. United States. In addition to meatpacking, Swift sold various dairy and grocery items, including Swiftning shortening, Allsweet margarine, Brookfield butter, cheese under the Brookfield, Pauly, and Treasure Cave brands, and Peter Pan peanut butter. Swift began selling frozen turkeys under the Butterball brand in 1954. Gustavus Swift also championed the refrigerated railroad car. =Esmark & ConAgra= In the 1960s, Swift expanded into other fields, including insurance and petroleum, and formed the holding company Esmark in 1973. Two years later, Esmark bought International Playtex from Meshulam Riklis' Rapid-American Corporation. Esmark sold off Globe Life Insurance to the Ryan Insurance Group in 1977. Esmark left the petroleum business in 1980, selling Vickers Petroleum to Mobil, while Swift's fresh-meat business was spun off as a separate company, Swift Independent Packing Company (SIPCO), the same year. Esmark went on to purchase Norton Simon Inc. in 1983 before being purchased by Beatrice Foods the next year. ConAgra purchased 50% of SIPCO in 1987 and the remaining portion in 1989, the same year ConAgra bought Beatrice Foods. ConAgra merged SIPCO's operations with that of Monfort, the meatpacker it had purchased in 1987, and the division was renamed Swift & Company in 1995. In 2002, ConAgra sold a majority stake in Swift & Company to Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst, a Dallas-based private-equity firm, and Booth Creek Management. Hicks, Muse bought the remainder of ConAgra's stake in 2004. =Purchase by JBS= On July 12, 2007, JBS purchased Swift & Company in a US$1.5-billion, all-cash deal. The acquisition made the newly consolidated JBS Swift Group the largest beef processor in the world. Prior to the deal, JBS had a market capitalization of US$4.2 billion and sales revenue of $2.1 billion, and operated in 23 plants in Brazil and five in Argentina. On July 11, 2007, the Swift companies had also completed several tender offers and consent solicitations for financing notes. These included 10‚Öõ% senior notes due 2009 and 12¬Ω% senior subordinated notes due January 1, 2010, both issued by Swift & Company, 11% senior notes due 2010 issued by S&C; Holdco 3 and 10¬º% convertible senior subordinated notes due 2010 issued by Swift Foods Company. In 2008, JBS purchased the beef operations of Smithfield Foods for $565 million. JBS also announced in 2008 its intention to buy National Beef Packing Company for $560 million, but canceled the plan after the U.S. Department of Justice raised antitrust concerns. In 2009, JBS USA acquired 63% of Pilgrim's Pride Chicken Company and shortened the name to simply 'Pilgrim's'. JBS subsequently increased its ownership share to 75.3%. In 2009, JBS USA Holdings, a Delaware company which operates at 1770 Promontory Circle Greeley CO and had Andr√© Nogueira de Souza as CFO, filed notice with the SEC that it desired to float an IPO, and listed 38 subsidiaries. Four accounting firms were listed on the Prospectus, the last to file being BDO Seidman LLP of Dallas TX on 21 July 2009. On 22 July 2009, BDO filed notice with the SEC that unaudited statements had been filed and that they were not endorsed by BDO. This torpedoed the 2009 IPO of JBS USA. On October 18, 2012, JBS USA announced it would take over management of XL Foods' Lakeside beefpacking plant in Brooks, Alberta, for 60 days with an exclusive option to buy XL Foods' Canada and US operations. On January 14, 2013, JBS USA completed the purchase of the Brooks facility, a second XL beef facility in Calgary, Alberta, and a feedyard. In July 2015, JBS USA purchased the U.S. pork processing business of Cargill Meat Solutions for $1.45 billion. Immigration raids In December 2006, six of the company's meat-packing facilities in Colorado, Nebraska, Texas, Utah, Iowa, and Minnesota were raided by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, resulting in the apprehension of 1,282 undocumented immigrants from Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Peru, Laos, Sudan, and Ethiopia, and nearly 200 of them were criminally charged after a ten-month investigation into identity theft. Food safety and quality issues On June 24, 2009, the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service announced that JBS Swift Beef Company, a Greeley, Colorado, establishment, recalled about of beef products that may be contaminated with E. coli O157:H7. By June 30, the recall included over . The beef products were produced on April 21 and 22, 2009, and were shipped to distributors and retail establishments in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Wisconsin. On November 4, 2010, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration ordered JBS Carriers, a subsidiary of JBS, to install electronic on-board recorders on their trucks after a compliance review found \\"serious violation\\" of federal hours of service. On December 2, 2010, JBS announced that it would use Arrowsight, a remote video auditing company, to monitor proper sanitation to prevent cross contamination during processing. They also use Arrowsight to monitor their live cattle for proper animal welfare practices. These programs have shown great success.https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=conewsstory&tkr;=JBS:US&sid;=aIMPvdW1oWAo The Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration assessed a $175,000 civil penalty against JBS/Swift on December 22, 2010, for violations of the Packers and Stockyards Act by failing to disclose when missing Fat-O- Meat‚Äôer data had prevented JBS from calculating the lean percentage of a particular pork carcass or carcasses in a seller's lot, and substituting an undisclosed lean value for pork carcasses with missing data when calculating carcass-merit payment for hogs delivered to JBS‚Äô Worthington, MN, Marshalltown, IA, and Louisville, KY, processing plants. The Packers and Stockyards Act is a fair trade practice and payment protection law that promotes fair and competitive marketing environments for the livestock, meat, and poultry industries. Coronavirus outbreak The JBS facility in Greeley, Colorado came into national focus during the COVID-19 outbreak when at least 50https://www.denverpost.com/2020/04/10/greeley-meat-plant-jbs-coronavirus/ workers tested positive by April 10, 2020, and two workers had died of the disease.

It is important in the xanthophyll cycle. Synthesized in plants and some micro- organisms, it is the pigment that gives paprika (made from bell peppers), corn, saffron, wolfberries, and many other plants and microbes their characteristic color. The name (pronounced zee-uh-zan'-thin) is derived from Zea mays (common yellow maize corn, in which zeaxanthin provides the primary yellow pigment), plus xanthos, the Greek word for \\"yellow\\" (see xanthophyll). Xanthophylls such as zeaxanthin are found in highest quantity in the leaves of most green plants, where they act to modulate light energy and perhaps serve as a non-photochemical quenching agent to deal with triplet chlorophyll (an excited form of chlorophyll) which is overproduced at high light levels during photosynthesis. Animals derive zeaxanthin from a plant diet. Zeaxanthin is one of the two primary xanthophyll carotenoids contained within the retina of the eye. Zeaxanthin supplements are typically taken on the supposition of supporting eye health. Although there are no reported side effects from taking zeaxanthin supplements, the actual health effects of zeaxanthin and lutein are not proven, and, as of 2018, there is no regulatory approval in the European Union or the United States for health claims about products that contain zeaxanthin. As a food additive, zeaxanthin is a food dye with E number E161h. Isomers and macular uptake Lutein and zeaxanthin have identical chemical formulas and are isomers, but they are not stereoisomers. The only difference between them is in the location of the double bond in one of the end rings. This difference gives lutein three chiral centers whereas zeaxanthin has two. Because of symmetry, the (3R,3‚Ä≤S) and (3S,3‚Ä≤R) stereoisomers of zeaxanthin are identical. Therefore, zeaxanthin has only three stereoisomeric forms. The (3R,3‚Ä≤S) stereoisomer is called meso-zeaxanthin. The principal natural form of zeaxanthin is (3R,3‚Ä≤R)-zeaxanthin. The macula mainly contains the (3R,3‚Ä≤R)- and meso-zeaxanthin forms, but it also contains much smaller amounts of the third (3S,3‚Ä≤S) form. Evidence exists that a specific zeaxanthin-binding protein recruits circulating zeaxanthin and lutein for uptake within the macula. Due to the commercial value of carotenoids, their biosynthesis has been studied extensively in both natural products and non-natural (heterologous) systems such as the bacteria Escherichia coli and yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Zeaxanthin biosynthesis proceeds from beta-carotene via the action of a single protein, known as a beta-carotene hydroxylase, that is able to add a hydroxyl group (-OH) to carbon 3 and 3‚Ä≤ of the beta-carotene molecule. Zeaxanthin biosynthesis therefore proceeds from beta-carotene to zeaxanthin (a di-hydroxylated product) via beta-cryptoxanthin (the mono hydroxylated intermediate). Although functionally identical, several distinct beta-carotene hydroxylase proteins are known. Due to the nature of zeaxanthin, relative to astaxanthin (a carotenoid of significant commercial value) beta- carotene hydroxylase proteins have been studied extensively. Relationship with diseases of the eye Several observational studies have provided preliminary evidence for high dietary intake of foods including lutein and zeaxanthin with lower incidence of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), most notably the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS2). Because foods high in one of these carotenoids tend to be high in the other, research does not separate effects of one from the other. * Three subsequent meta-analyses of dietary lutein and zeaxanthin concluded that these carotenoids lower the risk of progression from early stage AMD to late stage AMD. * A 2017 Cochrane review of 19 studies from several countries, however, concluded that dietary supplements containing zeaxanthin and lutein have little to no influence on the progression of AMD. In general, there remains insufficient evidence to assess the effectiveness of dietary or supplemental zeaxanthin or lutein in treatment or prevention of early AMD. As for cataracts, two meta-analyses confirm a correlation between high serum concentrations of lutein and zeaxanthin and a decrease in the risk of nuclear cataract, but not cortical or subcapsular cataract. The reports did not separate a zeaxanthin effect from a lutein effect. The AREDS2 trial enrolled subjects at risk for progression to advanced age-related macular degeneration. Overall, the group getting lutein (10 mg) and zeaxanthin (2 mg) did not reduce the need for cataract surgery. Any benefit is more likely to be apparent in subpopulations of individuals exposed to high oxidative stress, such as heavy smokers, alcoholics or those with low dietary intake of carotenoid-rich foods. In 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration rejected a Qualified Health Claims application by Xangold, citing insufficient evidence supporting the use of a lutein- and zeaxanthin- containing supplement in prevention of AMD. Dietary supplement companies in the U.S. are allowed to sell lutein and lutein plus zeaxanthin products using Structure:Function language, such as \\"Helps maintain eye health\\", as long as the FDA disclaimer statement (\\"These statements have not been evaluated...\\") is on the label. In Europe, as recently as 2014, the European Food Safety Authority reviewed and rejected claims that lutein or lutein plus zeaxanthin improved vision. Natural occurrence Zeaxanthin is the pigment that gives paprika (made from bell peppers), corn, saffron, wolfberries, and many other plants their characteristic color. Spirulina is also a rich source and can serve as a dietary supplement. Zeaxanthin breaks down to form picrocrocin and safranal, which are responsible for the taste and aroma of saffron. Foods containing the highest amounts of lutein and zeaxanthin are dark green leaf vegetables, such as kale, spinach, turnip greens, collard greens, romaine lettuce, watercress, Swiss chard and mustard greens. Safety An acceptable daily intake level for zeaxanthin was proposed as 0.75 mg/kg of body weight/day, or 53 mg/day for a 70 kg adult. In humans, an intake of 20 mg/day for up to six months had no adverse effects. As of 2016, neither the U.S. Food and Drug Administration nor the European Food Safety Authority had set a Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for lutein or zeaxanthin.

Austin was judged one of the best players in South Melbourne's 1933 premiership win over the Richmond Football Club. Austin was born in Boort in country Victoria, and grew up in Montague in inner-south-suburban Melbourne, where he excelled at various sports, including swimming and foot-running as well as winning trophies in the local district football competition. Recruited to South Melbourne from South Districts in 1930, Austin played for the Swans throughout their glory years as the \\"Foreign Legion\\", playing in all four grand finals for the Swans between 1933‚Äì1936. Austin was a fast, hard-tackling, high-marking player, and stylish right-footed kicker, versatile in competing in both defence and around the ground play. Austin retired from the South Melbourne team in 1938. He married Clare Hanrahan in 1939 and had two sons. During World War II he served for five years in the Australian Army. After the war he worked in administrative positions in the transport, media, racing and brewing industries. Austin joined the Australian Labor Party in his youth and was an active member of the Federated Clerks' Union (now part of the Australian Services Union). He was also active in the Industrial Groups, which were set up by Labor in the Victorian trade unions to combat the Communist Party of Australia, which then controlled the Clerks Union as well as many others. In 1954, when Labor split over the issue of communism, Austin sided with the anti-communist \\"Movement\\" forces led by B. A. Santamaria, and against the party's federal leader, Dr H. V. Evatt. The suburban newspaper, the Sandringham News, profiled Austin's 1955 candidacy in a full page article headlined \\"Victoria's Chifley\\".\\"Jack Austin: \\"Victoria's Chifley\\", the Sandringham News, 9 June 1955 As a result, Austin was twice a candidate for the House of Representatives, contesting the seat of Flinders in 1955 for the Australian Labor Party (Anti-Communist), the breakaway group opposed to Evatt, and in 1961 for its successor, the Democratic Labor Party (DLP). At both elections he polled 14.8 percent of the vote. In 1961 his preferences were decisive in the Liberal candidate retaining the seat. When the DLP was dissolved in the 1970s, Austin returned to supporting the ALP. In retirement Austin lived a quiet life with his wife in the bayside Melbourne suburb of Chelsea. Austin was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in late 1982 and died in hospital on 8 March 1983.

She is the author of the Wess'Har series, and is also known for writing tie-in material based on Star Wars, Gears of War, Halo, and G.I. Joe. Her work crosses various forms of media including novels, short stories, comics, and video games. Biography Traviss is originally from the Portsmouth area. She worked as both a journalist and defence correspondent before turning her attention to writing fiction, and has also served in both the Territorial Army and the Royal Naval Auxiliary Service. Traviss is a graduate of the Clarion Science Fiction and Fantasy workshop.The Clarion Foundation - Alumni List Her first published novel, City of Pearl (2004), centered on the clash of several distinct alien civilizations, several hundred years in the future. It was shortlisted for the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel and the Philip K. Dick Award. She has since written five sequels to City of Pearl: Crossing the Line (2004), The World Before (2005), Matriarch (2006), Ally (2007), and Judge (2008). In 2014, Traviss published Going Grey, a techno-thriller and the first novel in a series called Ringer.  Media tie-in works Star Wars= In addition to creating her own fictional settings, Traviss has written numerous novels using existing intellectual property‚Äîparticularly in the Star Wars universe. Traviss wrote the Republic Commando series, beginning with Hard Contact in 2004 and continuing with Triple Zero (2006), True Colors (2007), and Order 66 (2008). In 2009, a related novel featuring the same characters was released (Star Wars Imperial Commando: 501st). In addition to the Republic Commando Series, Traviss was one of three authors retained by Lucasfilm and Del Rey Books to pen a nine novel series called Legacy of the Force (the other two authors were Aaron Allston and Troy Denning). Her three contributions to the series are Legacy of the Force: Bloodlines (2006), Legacy of the Force: Sacrifice (2007) and Legacy of the Force: Revelation (2008). Thematically, her work within the Star Wars universe has frequently centered on Mandalorians and their culture. In particular, her Republic Commando novels have explored themes of identity with regards to clone troopers, their Mandalorian heritage, and their interaction with Jedi leadership. Traviss has since parted from Del Rey due to creative differences. In addition to Star Wars novels, Traviss also wrote a Gears of War prequel novel, Gears of War: Aspho Fields which was released on 28 October 2008. She then went on to write the sequels Gears of War: Jacinto's Remnant, released on 28 July 2009, Gears of War: Anvil Gate, released on 31 August 2010 and Gears of War: Coalition's End, released on 2 August 2011, and Gears of War: The Slab, released in May 2012. She also served as the lead writer for Gears of War 3. She wrote together with Eric Nylund and Tobias S. Buckell and many other authors the short story collection Halo Evolutions: Essential Tales of the Halo Universe, which was released in November 2009. On 21 July 2010 Traviss announced on her blog that she had signed a multi-book deal to write novels set in the Halo universe. The first book is set after the events of Halo: Ghosts of Onyx, and is a continuation of that story line. Explaining why she had agreed to write in the Halo universe, Traviss said that \\"Believe it or not, I really have found the backbone to turn down other series featuring heavily armoured, unfeasibly cannoned-up chaps struggling to find their place in an unfriendly world. I'm not a soft touch for any old bloke with a codpiece, people. But this is Halo. There's an awkward and upsetting moral dilemma at the heart of the story, and if there's something I can't resist more than money, it's exploring moral dilemmas. (With big weapons, naturally.) You haven't spotted it? Pay attention at the back, there. There is a story.\\" Traviss has written comic books as well. She began with a stint on Gears of War before moving on to Batman: Arkham Unhinged. In 2014 she began writing G.I. Joe comics for IDW Publishing.

For much of the 20th century, Ogilvy's was one of Ottawa's higher-end department stores. Charles Ogilvy (1861-1950) was born in Edinburgh, Scotland and emigrated to Canada with his family in 1863. His father, James Ogilvy, established a stationery store in Ottawa, and Charles followed in the retail business by opening his own dry goods shop at 92 Rideau Street in 1887. The business prospered and moved to new premises at 126 Rideau Street in 1907. The new store was designed by Ottawa architect W.E. Noffke, and the building was expanded in 1917, 1931 and 1934 (top 2 floors built in 1931 and 1934 were designed by architect A.J. Hazelgrove). Ogilvy's was a thriving retail enterprise, famous for its \\"tartan boxes\\". The success of Ottawa's local department stores, such as Ogilvy's, Freimans, Murphy-Gamble and Caplan's discouraged the expansion of national chains (including Eaton's, Simpson's, Simpsons-Sears and The Bay) into the National Capital Region until the 1950s (Simpsons-Sears opened its Carlingwood outlet in 1955). The store's appearance modernized in the 1940s removing the original \\"ribbed\\" bricks on the front in favor of a more \\"refined\\" look. The larger windows were removed in the 1950s and smaller ones added with granite tops. Over time, Ogilvy's opened a woodworking shop in Westboro and a number of small satellite stores in proximity to its Rideau Street store. In the 1960s, Ogilvy's opened a second location at the suburban Billings Bridge Plaza in south Ottawa. In later years, new suburban outlets at Lincoln Fields (in the west end) and Place d'Orl√©ans (in the east end) were opened. A fire occurred on December 29, 1969 at the downtown store which caused water damage to the main section, and the collapse of a warehouse/addition next door affected the store for a 2-month closure while they cleaned up the interior of \\"126 Rideau\\", which suffered major smoke and water damage, and rebuilt the warehouse next door that was totaled by fire. Followed by the expansion of national department store chains into Ottawa and the harsh economic climate of the 1980s, proved disastrous for Ogilvy's. The chain merged with the southern-Ontario Robinson's chain, and operated under the Robinson-Ogilvy banner for a number of years in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Eventually, the \\"Ogilvy\\" was dropped from the store name, and the small chain became known as \\"Robinson's\\". An era in Ottawa retailing was over. The Place d'Orl√©ans Robinson's store was the first to close in 1992, and the closure of the remaining Ottawa locations followed soon thereafter. In 1996, the Hudson's Bay Company acquired the remaining assets of Robinson-Ogilvy Ltd, although by that time the firm had been absent from Ottawa for four years. Ogilvy's former Rideau Street store remained vacant in a corner of the Rideau Centre shopping mall property until 2013, when partial demolition began in preparation for a planned expansion of the mall. Since the building was designated under the Ontario Heritage Act in 2000, the original 1907 building's Rideau and Nicholas Street fa√ßades were preserved for incorporation into the new addition. Work on the incorporation project started in December 2012 with removal of \\"test bays\\" in preparation of the removal of the fa√ßades to be kept and remounted on the new addition. Partial deconstruction of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th floors got underway in early March 2013, but on March 23, 2013, collapse of the northeast corner of the building temporarily halted demolition and closed streets surrounding the entire block cornered by Rideau, Nicholas and Besserer Streets. The collapse had no effect on the 2015 rebuild of the fa√ßade as all the necessary bricks had already been taken down and stored offsite for the rebuilding along with the original windows and decorative pieces. In March 2013, the Charles Ogilvy Ltd Facebook Page was created by a fan to document/preserve the past, present, and future of the building and company. It is updated regularly with new photos and tidbits regarding the company and its future.

Morgan Jr. Papers: Box #, Folder #. Archives of The Pierpont Morgan Library, New York. He inherited the family fortune and took over the business interests including J.P. Morgan & Co. after his father J. P. Morgan died in 1913. After graduating from St. Paul's School and Harvard, Morgan trained as a finance executive working for his father and grandfather. He became a banking financier, a lending leader, and a director of several companies. He supported the New York Lying-In Hospital, the Red Cross, the Episcopal Church, and endowed the creation of a rare book and manuscript collection at the Morgan Library. Morgan brokered a deal that positioned his company as the sole munitions and supplies purchaser during World War I for the British and French governments, bringing his company a 1% commission on $3 billion ($30 million). He was also a banking broker for financing to foreign governments both during and after the war. Early life Morgan was born on September 7, 1867 in Irvington, New York to J. P. Morgan and Frances Louisa Tracy who is the eighteenth great granddaughter of Edward I of England. He graduated from St. Paul's School and later, Harvard College, in 1886, where he was a member of the Delphic Club, formerly known as the Delta Phi. His siblings included Louisa Pierpont Morgan (1866‚Äì1946), who married Herbert L. Satterlee (1863‚Äì1947),J. Pierpont Morgan, Satterlee, Herbert L., New York: The Macmillan Company, 1939. Juliet Pierpont Morgan (1870‚Äì1952) who married William Pierson Hamilton (1869‚Äì1950), and Anne Tracy Morgan (1873‚Äì1952), a philanthropist. His paternal grandparents were Junius Spencer Morgan (1813‚Äì1890) and Juliet Pierpont (1816‚Äì1884), the daughter of John Pierpont. Career Jack Morgan walking alongside his father J. P. Morgan in the last known photograph of the two together (ca. 1913) The younger Morgan resembled his father in his dislike for publicity and continued his father's philanthropic policy. In 1905, his father acquired the Guaranty Trust bank as part of his efforts to consolidate banking in New York City. After his father died in 1913, the bank became Jack's base. =World War I= Morgan played a prominent part in financing World War I. Following its outbreak, he made the first loan of $12,000,000 to Russia.Horn (2000) pp 85-90 In 1915, a loan of $500,000,000 was made to France and Britain following negotiations by the Anglo-French Financial Commission. The firm's involvement with British and French interests fueled charges the bank was conspiring to maneuver the United States into supporting the Allies in order to rescue its loans. By 1915, when it became apparent the war was not going to end quickly, the company decided to forge formal relationships with France. Those dealings became strained over the course of the war as a result of poor personal relations with French emissaries, relationships that were heightened in importance by the unexpected duration of the conflict, its costs, and the complications flowing from American neutrality. Contributing to the tensions was the favoritism displayed by Morgan officials to British interests.Horn (2000) pp 91-103 His personal friendship with Cecil Spring Rice ensured that from 1915 until sometime after the United States entered the war, his firm was the official purchasing agent for the British government, buying cotton, steel, chemicals and food, receiving a 1% commission on all purchases. Morgan organized a syndicate of about 2200 banks and floated a loan of $500,000,000 to the Allies. The British sold off their holdings of American securities and by late 1916 were dependent on unsecured loans for further purchases. At the beginning of World War I, US Treasury Secretary William McAdoo and others in the Wilson administration were very suspicious of J. P. Morgan & Co.'s enthusiastic role as British agent for purchasing and banking. When the United States entered the war, this gave way to close collaboration, in the course of which Morgan received financial concessions. From 1914 to 1919, he was a member of the advisory council for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. On July 3, 1915, an assassin, Eric Muenter, entered Morgan's Long Island mansion and shot him twice. This was ostensibly to bring about an embargo on arms, and in protest of his profiteering from war. Morgan, however, quickly recovered from his wounds.Chernow (1990) ch 10 =Postwar= Time cover, 24 Sep 1923 After World War I and the Versailles Treaty, Morgan Guaranty managed Germany's reparation payments. After the war, Morgan made several trips to Europe to investigate and report on financial conditions there. In 1919 he was for a time chairman of the international committee, composed of American, British and French bankers, for the protection of the holders of Mexican securities. In November 1919, he was made a director of the Foreign Finance Corporation, which was organized to engage in the investment of funds chiefly in foreign enterprises. By the 1920s, Morgan Guaranty had become one of the world's most important banking institutions, as a leading lender to Germany and Europe. During the Great Depression he took heavy financial losses. The assets of the House of Morgan fell 40% from $704 million to $425 million.Chernow, p 349. American banking came under heavy attack. Morgan personified banking, and drew attacks from politicians, especially in the U.S. Senate's Pecora hearings of 1932, which \\"created a tidal wave of anger against Wall Street\\".Chernow, p 356.J. Bradford De Long, \\"JP Morgan and his money trust.\\" Wilson Quarterly 16.4 (1992): 16-30. He was a director in numerous corporations, including the U.S. Steel Corp., the Pullman Co., the Aetna Insurance Co., and the Northern Pacific Railway Co. He died on March 13, 1943 in Boca Grande, Florida and was interred in Cedar Hill Cemetery in Hartford, Connecticut. Morgan family memorial in Cedar Hill Cemetery Personal life Jack's brownstone, now part of the Morgan Library In 1890, Morgan married Jane Norton Grew (1868‚Äì1925), daughter of Boston banker and mill owner Henry Sturgis Grew. She was the aunt of Henry Grew Crosby. The couple raised four children: * Junius Spencer Morgan III (1892‚Äì1960), who married Louise Converse (1895‚Äì1974), daughter of Frederick Shepherd Converse, in 1915. * Jane Norton Morgan Nichols (1893‚Äì1981), who married George Nichols (1878‚Äì1950). * Frances Tracy Pennoyer (1897‚Äì1989), who married Paul Geddes Pennoyer (1890‚Äì1970), a lawyer, in 1917. * Henry Sturgis Morgan (1900‚Äì1982), a founding partner of Morgan Stanley who married Catherine Lovering Adams (1902‚Äì1988), daughter of Charles Francis Adams III, descendants of the 2nd U.S. President, John Adams. =Philanthropy= In 1920, Morgan gave his London residence, 14 Princes Gate (near Imperial College London), to the U.S. government for use as its embassy. In 1924, Morgan created the Pierpont Morgan Library as a public institution as a memorial to his father. Belle da Costa Greene, Morgan's personal librarian, became the first director and continued the aggressive acquisition and expansion of the collections of illuminated manuscripts, authors' original manuscripts, incunabula, prints, and drawings, early printed Bibles, and many examples of fine bookbinding. Today the library is a complex of buildings which serve as a museum and scholarly research center. Morgan donated many valuable works to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.https://www.pbs.org/wnet/historyofus/web10/features/bio/B14.html =Social= A yachtsman, like his father, Morgan served as commodore of the New York Yacht Club from 1919 to 1921. In 1930, he built the turbo electric driven yacht Corsair IV at Bath Iron Works in Maine. Corsair IV, launched April 10, 1930, was one of the most opulent yachts of its day and the largest built in the United States with an overall length of , beam and . Legend at the shipyard credits the phrase \\"If you have to ask, you can't afford it\\" to Morgan, when asked what the yacht cost. However, this quote is most often attributed to his father in connection with the yacht Corsair, launched in 1891. Morgan sold the Corsair IV to the British Admiralty in 1940 for one dollar to assist with Britain's war effort. After the war the Corsair IV was sold to Pacific Cruise Lines and, on September 29, 1947, began service as a luxury cruise ship operating between Long Beach, California and Acapulco, Mexico. On November 12, 1949 the yacht struck a rock near the beach in Acapulco and, although all passengers and crew were rescued, was deemed a total loss. Morgan was a member of the Jekyll Island Club (a.k.a. \\"The Millionaires' Club\\") on Jekyll Island, Georgia, as had been his father J. P. Morgan Sr. ReferencesFurther reading  * De Long, J.

It houses the Edmund Rice Centre, which is used for the education of learning impaired students. History Clairvaux College was founded by the Christian Brothers in 1966 as a Catholic all-boys secondary school with Brother Surawski as principal. In 1971 it was decided that the all-girls Catholic secondary school St Joseph's College be moved from its current location in Holland Park to the site adjoining Clairvaux College and be renamed Mackillop College. Sister Margaret Mary Campbell was the first principal. Both schools operated as separate colleges until 1984, with some sharing of classes, teaching staff, and sports facilities. A decision was made to amalgamate the two colleges and full integration occurred in 1988 with the co-educational school renamed to Clairvaux MacKillop College. House system The students are divided into the following 6 houses: *Aspinall (Orange): Named after Father Kevin Aspinall, PP. *Campbell (Yellow): Named after Sister Margaret Mary Campbell, first principal of Mackillop.

Reliance was funded by a nine member syndicate of members of the New York Yacht Club headed by Cornelius Vanderbilt III. Reliance was designed to take full advantage of the Seawanhaka '90-foot' rating rule and was suitable only for use in certain conditions. The 1903 America's Cup was the last to be raced according to the Seawanhaka rule. Design The design took advantage of a loophole in the Seawanhaka '90-foot' rating rule, to produce a racing yacht with long overhangs at each end, so that when heeled over, her waterline length (and therefore her speed) increased dramatically (see image at left). To save weight, she was completely unfinished below deck, with exposed frames. Reliance was the first racing boat to be fitted with winches below decks, in an era when her competitors relied on sheer man-power. Despite this a crew of 64 was required for racing due to the large sail plan. From the tip of her bowsprit to the end of her boom, Reliance measured , and the tip of her mast was above the water (the height of a 20-story building). Everything else was to an equally gargantuan scale; her spinnaker pole was long, and her total sail area of was the equivalent of eight 12 meter class yachts. Reliance was built for one purpose: to successfully defend the America's Cup. Career Her racing career was extraordinarily brief ‚Äì and undefeated. She bested her America's Cup challenger, Sir Thomas Lipton's Shamrock III, designed by William Fife, in all three races, with Shamrock III losing by such a margin in the third that she was forced to retire. Reliances designer, Nathanael Herreshoff, immediately proposed the Universal rating rule to avoid such extreme, dangerous and expensive vessels, which made Reliance an inadequate contestant in subsequent races. There was much speculation as to whether Reliances victory was due to the design of the yacht or the skill of Charlie Barr in sailing her. Lipton himself proposed to allow the two boats to swap crew after the race to decide the matter, but the offer was refused by the owners of Reliance. Her very successful career was short-lived, and she was sold for scrap in 1913. ReferencesFurther reading *N. L. Stebbins, W. H.

Brandon Johnson. The plot follows a mother and her adolescent daughter who are held hostage by bank robbers at an abandoned house; the robbers' plans are disrupted when they are all confronted by a serial killer who resides on a nearby property. Filmed over a period of two years on a budget of $200,000, Malevolence was purchased by Anchor Bay Films, who gave it a limited theatrical release in September 2004, and a DVD release in 2005. It received mixed reviews from critics, with some criticizing its referentiality and depiction of violence, while others praised it for its establishment of atmosphere and suspense. The film was followed by a prequel Bereavement in 2010 and a sequel Malevolence 3: Killer in 2018. Plot On May 14, 1989, six-year-old abductee Martin Bristol, whose face has been disfigured by his captor, watches as he butchers a young woman in the basement of a farmhouse. Over ten years later, on September 20, 1999, Julian and his girlfriend Marylin enact a bank heist with Marylin's ex-convict brother, Max, and accomplice Kurt, taking around $500,000. Max, who was shot by a security guard in the melee, dies in the car with Julian and Marylin; Kurt leaves in a separate car with the money, but breaks down en route to their meeting place: An abandoned house in the woods. Kurt takes Samantha Harrison and her adolescent daughter, Courtney, hostage from a gas station, forcing them to drive him to the house. When they arrive, he binds and gags them, and leaves a large portion of the money stowed in the van. Courtney manages to free herself and flees, stumbling upon a large abandoned farm nearby. In pursuit, Kurt searches a vacant garage on the property before entering a house, which is dilapidated and filled with degraded furnishings. Inside, he is clobbered with a metal pulley and stabbed to death by an unseen assailant. After burying Max's body in a field, Julian and Marylin drive to the abandoned house to meet with Kurt and divide the money. Arriving at nightfall, they find Samantha tied up and sleeping on the floor, and Kurt nowhere in sight. Julian takes his car to search for Kurt, leaving Marylin alone at the house with Samantha. From the foyer, Samantha watches as a man wearing Kurt's sack mask descends the stairs, but is unable to warn Marylin as her mouth is taped shut. The man drags Marylin into the dining room and stabs her to death. Meanwhile, while driving on backroads, Julian catches the attention of a parked police officer, and quickly retreats to the house, where he finds the entryway floor soaked in blood, and Samantha hiding in a closet. Samantha tells him that Kurt returned to the house and killed Marylin. Julian and Samantha leave on foot to search for Courtney, and also stumble upon the adjacent farm property. While investigating the house there, they find Courtney locked in an upstairs closet with Kurt's corpse. As Samantha unties Courtney's arms, the man in the sack mask attacks Julian and incapacitates Samantha and Courtney. Samantha awakens in the basement hanging from the ceiling. As the killer approaches her with a knife, she manages to pull down the metal piping from the ceiling, freeing herself, and flees with Courtney. The killer pursues them, and Julian is left alone in the farm, where he discovers numerous corpses in various states of decay, and finds Marylin's body posed against an arrangement of human and animal bones. Samantha and Courtney return to the adjacent house to retrieve the van keys. As they are about to leave, Samantha sees the killer coming toward the house, and the two retreat to a bedroom upstairs to hide, but the killer finds and attacks them. Julian arrives and shoots him, but he does not die immediately. Samantha smashes a chair over the killer's head, knocking him unconscious. Julian removes his mask, revealing a young man with a scar across his face; the killer is Martin Bristol, now a teenager. The three flee, and the police officer arrives at the house just as Samantha and Courtney exit. Julian stumbles out after them holding a gun, and the officer shoots him to death. When the officer goes upstairs to locate Martin, he has vanished. The following morning, forensic investigators remove numerous bodies from the farm property, and uncover journals from the serial killer who abducted Martin and groomed him to be a killer himself. The journals suggest that Martin, who gained strength as he grew into adulthood, killed his abductor in the manners in which he was taught. That evening, Samantha prepares to go to bed; on the floor is the duffel bag full of the money that Kurt left in her van. While she and Courtney lie down to sleep, the closet door behind them opens.

Guida II as Martin Bristol *Kevin McKelvey as Special Agent William Perkins Production Writer and director Stevan Mena began working on the script for the film in 1995, which went through various iterations. In it, he said his intentions were to craft a slasher film that also explored the idea of nature versus nurture in relation to how people become serial killers. =Filming= Malevolence was shot over a period of two years between late 2000 and December 2002. Various production setbacks occurred, one of which included the crew being banned from the original shooting location in Long Island: The production crew received permission to use an abandoned home in which to shoot the film, only to discover two days before principal photography that the home had in fact been foreclosed on, and the man who gave them the permission the former owner. The film was shot on 35mm film by documentary cinematographer Tsuyoshi Kimono, who had previously shot documentaries for A&E.; The bank robbery scenes were shot in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and additional photography in the car scenes was shot in Bethlehem. The farm and slaughterhouse property was shot at an actual abandoned cattle farm and slaughterhouse built in 1920 in Pennsylvania. Release Malevolence was given a limited theatrical release in the United States on September 10, 2004, through Anchor Bay Films. It opened in a total of ten theaters, and grossed $127,287, averaging $6,722 per theater. =Reception= Malevolence holds an overall approval rating of 33% on the internet review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. Ned Martel of The New York Times said the film \\"will lead Halloween-inspired viewers into this dark place for some palpitations, but the thrills will come from sheer density of gruesome images, not from frightfully new ideas.\\" Varietys Dennis Harvey said of the film: \\"The mark of a good horror director is seldom in onscreen gore, but rather the ability to make every anticipatory moment tingle with dread. On that level, Stevan Mena‚Äôs first feature Malevolence scores well, building a grim atmosphere sans Scream-style winking to tell its tale of bank robbers who choose the wrong abandoned rural house to hide out in.\\" Rober Dominiquez of the New York Daily News gave the film 1.5 out of 4 stars, writing that the film \\"turns out to be nothing more than a derivative thriller featuring yet another silent, masked killer. Mena has a gift for sustaining tension, and there are a couple of moments that make you jump. But the acting and dialogue is as silly as the potato sack the killer wears on his head.\\" Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide awarded the film 2 out of 4 stars, writing, calling it \\"a straightforward throwback to old-school slasher movies that wears its influences on its bloody sleeve and delivers a solid ratio of suspense to shocks.\\" Mark Holcomb of The Village Voice panned the film, calling it \\"laughably unscary,\\" and marked by \\"dimensionless medium shots and ham-fisted symbolic imagery.\\" Malevolence won three best feature film awards at the 2003 International Film Expo. Director Stevan Mena won in a separate category for best director in the same year. =Prequel= On February 2, 2010, Mena announced that he planned a prequel to his film. Bereavement stars Michael Biehn and John Savage as well as Nolan Gerard Funk and Alexandra Daddario. =Sequel= A sequel Malevolence 3: Killer was released on October 12, 2018 along with Blu-ray re-releases of the first 2 movies.

Published in March, 2004, it is the first book of the Wess'Har Series. Among the main characters are Shan Frankland, the hardened cop and forceful commander; Josh Garrod, the devout Christian and gentle leader; Aras, the lonely Wess'har, outcast by his horrible disease; and Lindsay Neville, the Marines Commander dealing with an unplanned pregnancy. City of Pearl is a book that deals with morals, especially concerning environmentalism, and keeps action sequences to a minimum. Plot introduction The novel opens in the year 2198 and shows several preliminary scenes both on Earth and on alien planets; however, most of the action takes place much later, in the year 2374, on planet Cavanagh's Star. The planet is far from Earth, but very similar to it in atmosphere; it is claimed already by three alien races when a group of gethes (alien term for humans) arrives to explore, led by former police woman, Shan Frankland. The Bezeri (squid-like water dwellers) are the planet's natural inhabitants, the Isenj are invaders here to take advantage of unused land, and the Wess'har are the mediators, here to defend the Bezeri from Isenj pollution. Also coexisting on the planet is Constantine - a Christian colony of humans (led by Josh Garrod) who landed on the planet several generations ago in an attempt to escape the corruption of Earth. Constantine is guided by the Wess'har, Aras, who is plagued with a strange disease which outcasts him from Wess'har society. The political balance is tenuous, and Shan must play the mediator between her anxious, disobedient crew and the powerful military force of these alien beings. At the same time, she is troubled by her own past and the strange relationship that seems to be forming between her and Aras, as she struggles to lead a mission whose goal she doesn't yet consciously know. =Explanation of the novel's title= \\"City of Pearl\\" is the name humans have given to a Wess'har city located on planet Wess'ej. Josh Garrod's predecessor, Benjamin, who was taken to see the city by Aras, was said to have wept at its beauty. Many of the people of Constantine relate it to heaven, despite Aras' insistence that the City of Pearl is \\"just a city.\\" Plot summary On Planet Earth, Superintendent Shan Frankland (A hardened, self-sufficient, and brutally honest female cop) is preparing for retirement when she is confronted by politician Eugenie Perault, who recruits Shan to lead a top-secret mission into outer space on a ship named the Thetis. Her destination is Cavanagh's Star; a planet hundreds of light years away, but with an atmosphere strikingly similar to that of Earth. However, rather than risk exposure of the classified information Shan will need to carry out the unknown mission, Perault gives Shan a Suppressed Briefing (SB), which installs the information into Shan's subconscious mind, only to be brought forth when circumstances call for it. Knowing only that she was preceded on this journey by a colonist group named Constantine (who have never been heard from again), and that the time in speed-of-light travel will amount to 75 years on Earth but only months for her ship, Shan sets off in command of a mix-matched group of specialized civilians (called the \\"payload\\") anxious to use the planet for their own gain, and competing for control with Commander Lindsay Neville, the independent leader of a small force of marines. When Shan and the Thetis crew reach Cavanagh's Star, however, they have big surprises ahead of them. Not only do they find Constantine alive and thriving as a religious colony within a carefully controlled biosphere designed to grow crops brought from Earth, but they also discover a unique and complex environment of alien plants and animals, including such species as the scavenger rock velvets, and the bog-dwelling predator shevens. The civilian scientists are itching to take samples and compile medical information. But the small band of humans soon learns that the planet isn't theirs to claim. Two unique alien races inhabit Cavanagh's Star; the water-dwelling, squid-like Bezeri, and the bipedal Wess'har. The Wess'har, who originate from Wess'ej, the planet's moon, are strong environmentalists who see each species as an intelligent race; they are extreme vegans, and take pride in the fact that their architecture is subterranean and unobtrusive. For centuries, they have protected Cavanagh's Star and the Bezeri from the Isenj - a third alien race who once attempted to colonize the planet. When the pollution from Isenj cities which they had built on the planet got so bad that it was killing Bezeri by the millions, the Wess'har stepped in. Now, not a single trace of the enormous Isenj civilization can be found on the planet - a stunning example to Shan's crew of what the Wess'har military is capable of. On the planet, Shan meets Josh Garrod - the Christian leader of Constantine - who explains to her the ways of the Constantine people. They live in a hardworking, god-oriented society in which crime is almost non-existent and technology is kept to a minimum. Josh is in contact with the Wess'har (mainly through a representative named Aras) and follows their orders compliantly, knowing that the Wess'har could obliterate Constantine at any time, should they so wish. According to the agreement between Shan and the Wess'har (made through Josh), the Thetis has been allowed to land and to make camp within the boundaries of Constantine. However, both Constantine and the Wess'har are wary of the Thetis and its intentions. The crew is permitted to explore the planet (with Wess'har or Constantine guides) but are given one ultimate rule: no samples. The Thetis must leave nothing and take nothing - and that means no scientific samples. Shan's crew grumbles at the arrangement, and some resolve not to heed the warnings given to them. Through Josh, Shan eventually comes in contact with Aras, the Wess'har representative and protector of the Constantine colony. However, Aras is not a normal Wess'har, nor does he even look like one, though Shan does not yet know this. He used to be completely Wess'har, but his appearance, along with many of his attributes, had altered since he had been infected with a disease unknown to humankind. This \\"disease,\\" called c'nataat, is actually a symbiotic creature which uses genetic information from previous hosts and ingested materials to alter its current host's genetics to fit its own needs. Though in many ways it had made Aras more efficient (it gives him an indefinite lifespan, and allows him to hold his breath under water for extended periods of time), the disease, which is transferable by touch, has cut him off from everyone he knows and left him suspended in time as his friends and family slowly die off. When Shan learns about his trouble - and touches Aras for the first time in 170 years - a bond begins to form between the two of them. In the meantime, within the Thetis crew, issues are rising. Shan must fight for the power and respect she requires to run her mission; the \\"payload\\" scientists are angry at the restrictions placed on them, and Commander Neville is sore at her lack of power as only second in command. However, Shan and Neville learn to work together as the anger of the payload increases and Neville discovers she has yet another issue on her hands - an unplanned pregnancy has occurred from a hookup just days before the launch of the Thetis. Abortion pills are available, but Neville decides to have the baby, despite the fact that medic Hugel tells her it could be complicated. At the same time, Shan begins to get little whispers from her SB, telling her to look for a gene bank that Constantine supposedly possesses. It is a compilation of seeds and embryos from Earthly plants and animals, and rumored to be the largest ever compiled. Also, she keeps thinking the name \\"Helen,\\" but does not know who this is. This is the first of a series of 6 books dealing with the complications and consequences of the actions taken in the first book. Characters in \\"City of Pearl\\" *Shan Frankland is an ex-police woman and leader of the Thetis expedition. She has a past in aiding \\"eco-terrorists.\\" She is hardened and dangerous, but shows her humanity in her private confusion about her past actions and her arising feelings for Sergeant Bennett. *Aras is a Wess'har, but is genetically altered due to his symbiotic \\"disease,\\" c'nataat. He considers all species (including rats) to be intelligent, sentient races. He does not always understand humans, but he finds himself drawn to Shan, who shows him compassion. *Josh Garrod is the leader of Constantine. A devout Christian, he keeps peace in his colony and organizes workers, but in terms of politics and many other things, he obeys the Wess'har. *Lindsay Neville is Commander of the marines. She is initially angered at being placed under the command of a \\"copper,\\" but learns to work with Shan when the going gets rough. *Adrian Bennett is a marine Sergeant. He proves his bravery by saving Mesevy from an alien swamp at risk of his own life; however, he is mocked among his comrades for his \\"loose bowels.\\" He seems to share a mutual attraction with Frankland. *Eugenie Perault is the government worker who recruited Shan to lead the Thetis mission. She is given little development, but her voice often plays in Shan's mind as her SB memories resurface. *Helen Marchant is the sister of Eugenie Perault. She was once a worker in an environmental corporation, but used her position to pass information to certain \\"eco- terrorists.\\" Shan, who investigated the case, discovered this, but Helen used Shan's affinity for the environment to convince her to help them rather than report them. Shan initially believes that she did the right thing, but begins to have doubts. *Mestin is the leading Wess'har Matriarch. She is cautious and seems to dislike humans. Aras often disagrees with her, but is usually able to compromise with her to get what he wants. *Malcolm Okurt is the Captain of the Actaeon. He is described as emotionless, and works only as the extension of a large Earthly corporation. =The Payload= *Eddie Michallat: Journalist; He is honest and moral, despite initial preconceptions about his profession. He is much more laid back than his companions and takes pride in his ability to be disconnected with the stories he reports on. However, he finds himself more \\"connected\\" than ever when he turns Parekh in to Shan for taking a forbidden sample. *Kristina Hugel: Physician; She is interested in Wess'har surgical procedures (especially near the end of the novel) and is not closely trusted by Shan or Neville. *Mohan Rayat: Pharmacologist; Insistent and forward, Rayat leads most of the payload in their mutinous feelings toward Shan. Near the end, he deliberately leaves the camp, against a direct order, and causes a face off between the Isenj and Shan's search party. *Sabine Mesevy: Botanist; Almost perishes in an alien swamp after falling from a living pathway. She is saved by Adrian Bennett. Being religious and wanting to spend much of her time in the church at Constantine, she obtains special permission to visit the town unescorted. She decides to stay behind at the end of the book. *Oliver Champciaux: Geologist; Relatively polite and cooperative toward Shan. *Louise Galvin: Xenozoologist; Follows Rayat in his deviation from the camp. She is accidentally shot in the crossfire. *Surenda Parekh: Marine biologist; Finds and illegally takes a \\"sample\\" from a beach (a beached infant Bezeri which she believes to be dead). This causes much conflict between Thetis and the Bezeri. Parekh is eventually executed for her actions. *Vani Paretti: Xenomicrobiologist. Major themes Arguably, City of Pearl is themed around morals and human nature [2]. Allusions and referencesAllusions to actual history, geography and current science= \\"Government work is God's work\\" There is one aspect of the stories that mixes science and fiction. As the series progresses, the relativistic prohibition on matter moving as fast or faster than light is observed, but instantaneous communication is permitted.

A Mas is a traditional farmhouse unique to Provence and Southern France. = Germany = A timber-framed Middle German house in Klein Sch√∂ppenstedt near Cremlingen around 1900 Historically there were three main types of German farmhouses, many of which survive today. The Low German house or Niedersachsenhaus (Lower Saxony house) is found mainly on the North German Plain, but also in large parts of the Netherlands. It is a large structure with a sweeping roof supported by two to four rows of internal posts. The large barn door at the gable end opens into a spacious hall, or Deele, with cattle stalls and barns on either side and living accommodation at the end. The Middle German house may also be a single unit, but access is from the side, and the roof is supported by the outside walls. Later this type of mitteldeutsches Haus was expanded to two or more buildings around a rectangular farmyard, often with a second story. The South German house is found in southern Germany and has two main variants, the Swabian or Black Forest house and the Bavarian farmstead. = Italy = A Cascina a corte is a courtyard building whose arrangement is based on the Roman villa found in the Po Valley of northern Italy.

In Quebec, the style varied from Gothic to Swiss, with the kitchen being the most important room in the house. In Ontario, the farmhouses of the late 19th century were of Victorian influence. Earlier ones used clapboard and later variations had brick. Many had front porches. In the west, dwellings varied from single-story wooden homesteads to straw huts. Wooden houses were built later as railroads brought wood from the Rockies (Alberta, British Columbia). By the early 1900s houses could be purchased as kits from several Canadian and American companies. Canadian homes often differ from their American counterparts in that the porch was often enclosed. From 1850 onward many featured vernacular interpretations of the more formal architectural styles, such as Greek Revival, Italianate, Carpenter Gothic, and Queen Anne. = United States = American farmhouses had a straightforward construction designed to function amidst a working farm in a rural setting. They had a simple rectangular floor plan, usually built with local materials, and included a dominant centrally- located fireplace for cooking and heating.

Ciliwung \\"), bottom center in the map of rivers and canals of Jakarta (2012) Ci Liwung (often written as Ciliwung; also as Tjiliwoeng in Dutch) is a 119 km long river in the northwestern region of Java where it flows through two provinces, West Java and the special region of Jakarta. The natural estuary of the Ciliwung river, known as the Kali Besar (\\"Big River\\"), was an important strategic point for trade in the precolonial and colonial periods and was instrumental in the founding of the port city of Jakarta, but has been lost from reorganization of the watercourse of the rivers around the area into canals. Etymology The etymology of Ciliwung is uncertain; the two least implausible assumptions are \\"the whirlpool\\" (compare Sundanese liwung \\"be distressed, upset\\" and Javanese \\"madly turning around, be tormented\\") or \\"the meandering one\\" (compare Malay liuk, liut \\"to twist\\"). It is possible that the name originated from one of the many epithets of the king of Pajajaran Sri Baduga Maharaja, among them is Prabu Haliwung, so named because of his temperamental attitude. The name Ci Haliwung was recorded in the map of C.M. Pleyte (1919). Geography Upper Ci Liwung near its source in the Puncak area. Ci Liwung is 119 km long with a catchment area of 476 km2. The Ciliwung river has its source at Mandalawangi in Bogor Regency with the highest peak at 3,002 m. The river flows in a northern direction passing several active volcanoes, Mount Salak, Mount Kendeng, and Mount Halimun, crosses two main cities Bogor and Jakarta before finally flowing into the Java Sea through Jakarta Bay. The main tributaries in the upper catchment area are the Ciesek and Ciluar rivers with respective lengths 9.7 km and 21.0 km, with catchment areas of 27.15 km2 and 35.25 km2 respectively. Ciliwung river basin has a narrow and elongated shape. The 17.2 km length of the upstream area has a very steep slope (0.08), The 25.4 km length in the middle-reach has a slope of 0.01 and the downstream, 55 km in length, has a flat slope of 0.0018. In general the geology of the upstream of Ciliwung river basin is dominated by Tuffaceous Breccia and older deposits lahar and lava. The middle-reach consists mainly of Quaternary period alluvial fans and volcanic rocks. The downstream area is dominated by alluvial and beach ridge deposits. Mean rainfall reaches 3,125 mm, with mean annual discharge of 16 m3/s as measured at Ciliwung Ratujaya observation station (231 km2). With such topographical, geological and hydrological features the Ciliwung river is often overflowing and inundating parts of Jakarta. The population along the Ciliwung river basin reaches 4.088 million (Census 2000) which can be regarded as the most densely populated area. =Jakarta's canal= The natural flow of Ciliwung was diverted into canals by the Dutch during the early settlement of Jakarta (then named as Batavia). Beginning in area that is now Istiqlal Mosque, the Ciliwung was diverted into two canals, one flowing northwest and one flowing northeast. The western branch flows along the canal of Jalan Veteran and then through the canal of Jalan Gajah Mada. This 2 km straight canal is known as Batang Hari canal, previously known as Molenvliet, which was dug in the 17th century. Formerly the water branches into two direction in Glodok, following the two course that is now Jalan Pancoran and Jalan Pinangsia Raya; today the water from Batang Hari canal was diverted east before Lindeteves Trade Center. Eventually the water ends up in Sunda Kelapa harbor after passing through the canals of Jakarta Old Town. The eastern branch of Ci Liwung passing through a canal near Mangga Dua Square The eastern branch flows along the canal of Jalan Antara, passing the Gedung Kesenian Jakarta and then along the canal of Jalan Gunung Sahari. The water ends up in Ancol. Initially a canal links the eastern and the western branches of Ciliwung. Today this canal, which is now located on the south side of Jalan Tol Pelabuhan, was filled with slum settlement due to careless planning after the independence period. After the 1918 Jakarta's big flood, a new canal, the Banjir canal (\\"flood canal\\"), was constructed in 1922 to divert the water of several rivers of Jakarta, which includes Ciliwung, Cideng, and Krukut. The flow of Ciliwung was diverted through the Manggarai floodgate, constructed at the point near Manggarai station. The water is diverted to the west of the city through Pasar Rumput, Dukuh Atas and going to northwest to Karet Kubur and continued to Tanah Abang, Tomang, Grogol, Pademangan, and ends at Muara Angke. The New East Flood Canal has been opened since 2010, a 23 kilometers canal from Cipinang River to the east and then to the north of Java Sea as a quarter of a circle with 100 to 300 meters width. On December 19, 2013 a contract to build water tunnel(s) to East Flood Canal from Ciliwung River with minimum capacity of 60 cubic meters per second has been signed by Public Works Ministry. So, the floods in East Jakarta to the north and along the Ciliwung River will be eased. HistoryKingdoms of Tarumanegara and Sunda= 17th-century map of the area south of Batavia, showing River Ciliwung with outposts protecting the road from Batavia to Fort Padjajaran (now Bogor), the River Cisadane, and Citarik. The Ciliwung River Basin has been populated at least since the 4th century. Two kingdoms were founded along the Upper Ciliwung in Bogor; Tarumanegara (4th-5th Century) with its King Purnawarman and Sunda (15th-16th Century) with its King Sri Baduga. The existence of these Kingdoms is found from ancient inscriptions at Ciaruteun (Tarumanagara) and Batutulis (Padjajaran). In the early 16th- century, Ciliwung was an important mean of transportation from the fortified city of Pakuan Pajajaran, the capital of Hindu Sunda Kingdom. Sunda Kelapa, located at the mouth of Ciliwung (more or less at the north end of present Kali Besar), was the main harbor of the Kingdom of Sunda. Among the many epithets of the king Sri Baduga Maharaja, was Prabu Haliwungan - so called because of his temperamental attitude. The river Ci Haliwung or Ci Liwung was probably named after the king's epithet. The name Ci Haliwung or Tji Haliwoeng was recorded in the map of C.M. Pleyte (1919). During the rise of the Hindu Kingdom of Sunda, Ciliwung became the important mean of transportation for the kingdom. To protect Sunda Kelapa from the Islamic Sultanate of Cirebon and Demak, Prabu Surawisesa (recorded by the Portuguese as Samian) was instructed by the king to sign a peace treaty with the Portuguese to trade in pepper in exchange to a permission to built a fort to protect the main port of Sunda Kalapa. The pact was immortalized in a 1522 padr√£o. Despite the treaty, the Portuguese failed to construct the fort at the given year. The padr√£o of Sunda Kelapa was found by Fatahillah, commander of the Sultanate of Demak, and was fell into the Ciliwung without any ceremony. The padr√£o will only be rediscovered in 1918. =VOC period=Within the walled Batavia A map showing the transformation of the mouth of Ciliwung into canals flowing through the inner city and moat flowing around the city and the fort of Batavia.Sunda Kelapa was used as the main port by the Dutch (1619) who constructed a fort at the east bank of the estuary and founded Batavia, the largest city and the capital of the East Indies Empire, until the city was transformed into Jakarta after the independence of Indonesia. Sultanate of Banten (1527) With the establishment of Batavia in the 17th century, the Dutch diverted Ciliwung into canals following a typical Dutch city pattern. The waters of Ciliwung was also channeled to form two inner and outer moats and a wall surrounding the city of Batavia. The largest canal which flows through the middle of Batavia was named Kali Besar or Dutch Grote Rivier (\\"Big River\\"). Small boats sailed along Ciliwung to transport goods from warehouses close to Kali Besar to ships anchored at the port. The maintenance of the canals within the walled city of Batavia is difficult because of its frequent sedimentation. In the middle of the 1630s, the canals became really shallow, making it difficult for ships to enter Batavia. In order to deal with this, an 800 m long ditch was constructed to the sea that was routinely dredged to ease the flow of water. The length of the ditch increased to 1,350 m (1827) from the mouth of the river due to accumulation of sand and mud and what more with the earthquake in January 1699 Ciliwung tributary that empties into the ocean was used for ship entrance into the castle from the canals to Waterpoort. The water of the canals were used by the citizens for drinking water. In 1689, the canals were still unpolluted and could be used for drinking water. The earthquake, which occurred in January 1699, caused the increase in sedimentation level. Heaps of mud and sand accumulated in the ditch that was dredged to ease the flow of the water to and from the river. In 1740, the canal of Batavia was considered unhealthy because of rubbish and the waste from the Binnen Hospital discharged into the river. Many patients suffered from dysentery and cholera. The unhygienic drinking water caused high death rates among the Batavia citizens. On the other hand, most of the Chinese who drank tea rarely got sick. Aware of this, many Dutch people ate tea leaves to stay healthy, but obviously this attempt did not succeed. By the end of the 18th century, Doctor Thunberg still prescribed tea leaves instead of boiled water. It was still unknown at that time that bacteria can be killed by boiling water until boiling point. The Dutch still drank water from Ciliwung through the 19th century. Water from Ciliwung was initially stored in a reservoir (waterplaats or aquada) near Fort Jacatra, north of the city. Later the reservoir was transferred to the sides of Molenvliet in Glodok area. The reservoir contains wooden water outlets which pour water from the height of about 10 feet. The local people knows the area around this reservoir as Pancuran. Back then when Molenvliet was deep enough for boats to sail, annual Peh Cun or Dragon Boat festival were held in the river. In the area surrounding Batavia Outside Batavia, within the ommelanden (area surrounding Batavia), canals were constructed by channeling the waters of the rivers surrounding Batavia (e.g. Ciliwung, River Ancol, River Angke, River Krukut, and River Grogol). The creation of canals are mainly to improve transportation of goods to the walled city of Batavia and to expand agricultural land by draining the water of the marshes surrounding Batavia to be converted into arable land. In 1648, the Ciliwung was connected with the Krukut via Molenvliet. There was an attempt to close the Ciliwung river course north of Noordwijk. The part of the river was dammed so that the river was forced to flow westward via Molenvliet. Despite the attempt, seasonal flooding occurred where the Ciliwung forced its water to flow back to its old tributary, which was still happening around 1725. In 1681, the Ciliwung flow was diverted toward the east along the Postweg (now Jalan Pos) to reach a new canal known as Gunung Sahari Canal. Gunung Sahari Canal divert the flow of Ciliwung to reach the Java Sea to the north, near the mouth of River Ancol (now the canal near Dunia Fantasi). In the Gunung Sahari Canal, the Ciliwung merged again with its old course at the Krekot Sentiong area. The construction of Gunung Sahari canal caused frequent flooding in the area along the Noordwijk (now Jalan Ir. H. Juanda). Because of this, a lock was constructed at the west side of the Noordwijk (named schutsluis Noordwijk, later becoming the Willemsluis) to protect Noordwijk from flooding, The lock gives name to the streets surrounding the area Jalan Pintu Air (\\"water lock street\\"). The part of Ciliwung that flows straight from Harmoni to the north used to be a private river with toll payments for those who wanted to pass through it. This river was named Molenvliet and it was built by the Dutch by Kapitein der Chinezen (head of the Chinese in Betawi), Phoa Beng Gan known as Beng Gan. In 1648, Beng Gan received permission from the Company to build this river and collected toll payments from sampans that passed through. In 1654, it was taken over by the Company for 1.000 real. Restoration The river water is murky once it reaches Jakarta because the area of its flow is a disposal area. As a result, the river is growing shallower and the flow slower. In 2014, the Audit Board of Indonesia released a four-year audit of the river and found that seventeen separate companies had been polluting its waters, submitting a report to the police.Fitrian Ardiansyah, Andri Akbar Marthen, and Nur Amalia, Forest and land-use governance in a decentralized Indonesia: A legal and policy review, pg. 32. Bogor: Center for International Forestry Research, 2015. Indonesian Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing (PUPR) has a separate Ciliwung Cisadane River Region Center (BBWSCC). DKI Jakarta Provincial Government and BBWSCC have an agreement on the normalization of some rivers in Jakarta. The DKI Provincial Government is tasked with freeing land for normalization needs to be carried out by BBWSCC. A restoration project is undertaken to widen and water flow of the river. The restoration project is divided into four sections with a total length of about 19-km, extending from Manggarai to the Jl. TB Simatupang area in South Jakarta. Ciliwung will also be widened from present 25 meters up to 40 ‚Äì 50 meters. It is expected that the water flow will increase from current 200 cubic meters per second to 570 cubic meters per second. = Ciliwung-Cisadane tunnel = A coordination meeting on January 20, 2014 among the Ministry of Public Works, Ministry of Environment, Jakarta Governor, Bogor Mayor, Bogor Regent and Ciliwung-Cisadane Rivers Control Office agreed to build Ciliwung to Cisadane River to ease Ciliwung debit when Cisadane is not in flood condition. The tunnel is 2.9 kilometers long and diameter of six meters. Culture The Ciliwung River flows through two provinces, West Java and the Special Region of Jakarta. Two main races dominate the region namely, the Sundanese (West Java) in southern Ciliwung and Orang Betawi (Jakarta) in northern Ciliwung. Culture in the Bogor area is mainly Sundanese, such as can be observed from traditional dances, the Ketuk Tilu or the Jaipongan which is modern, sensual and full of spirit. Specific Sundanese music can be observed from the Degung, Calung, Angklung and Kecapi suling. Culture of Jakarta can be seen in the Yapong dance and Gambang kromong as well as Kroncong music can still be found at Tugu, north of Jakarta. Also famous is a humorous play, the Lenong, using a special Betawi dialect. Environment The section of Ciliwung in Jakarta is heavily polluted. Informal settlements or slums flourished on the banks of Ciliwung, increasing the amount of waste and reducing the surface area of the river. Some canals was completely blocked by slums and people created informal gardens inside by drying the canal. Water maintenance and ecological awareness is minimal. Other sources of pollution originate from agricultural runoff of upstream river users and industrial pollution. Flooding is a problem of Ciliwung. With many of the original forest converted into settlements around Puncak area, the flooding has worsened each year. In 2012, the government of Indonesia announced a 20-year plan to clean up the Ciliwung river, which kicked off with a $10 million restoration project that will include the construction of a waste processing facility in 2013 and an education centre for riverside communities. The city administration now hires over 4000 workers to regularly clean the city‚Äôs rivers, canals, lakes and coastal areas. Ex-Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama also plans to turn parts of the Ciliwung riverbank into a tourist site.

Stephanie Sheh, Orihime's English voice actress, found Orihime to be a \\"tricky\\" character as she noted a challenge to find a balance with her voice as although she sometimes seems ditzy, in other times she is very strong. Character outline Orihime is friendly, humorous, sensitive and kind. She comes off as na√Øve and rather clueless, which is at odds with her exceptionally high marks in school. Her cooking style can be described as very bad, disgusting, or more often strange to the point that aside from Rangiku Matsumoto, no one would think it delectable, and is one of the running jokes in the series. Orihime has a tendency to rush into situations without thinking, sometimes leading to embarrassing or even dangerous consequences. She tends to have an overactive imagination and gets carried away thinking of implausible scenarios, such as initially fantasizing a date with Ichigo, later ending into her becoming a boxing champion prior to being shot. Her hair is worn long in honor of the promise Tatsuki Arisawa once made to protect her. Orihime experiences most feelings, which leads her to be jealous of the relationship that Ichigo and Rukia Kuchiki share despite her friendship and admiration of both of them. Through her expanding role in the manga, Orihime was happier and goofier at the start of the series, but later arcs deal with her feelings of inadequacy and inner turmoils. Orihime lives by herself in Karakura Town, where the story takes place, and is supported by her distant aunt provided that she continuously obtain good marks in school, which she does. She and her brother Sora were raised by parents who treated them poorly. When Sora turned eighteen, he ran away with Orihime, who was three years old, and raised her since. For nine years, the siblings lived in harmony, until Sora died in a car accident. AppearancesIn Bleach= Orihime first appears in Bleach pilot chapter that Tite Kubo submitted to Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump. She is a teenager who attends Karakura High School and Ichigo's friend. After Ichigo gains the powers of a Soul Reaper, his interactions with Orihime begin to have unforeseen side effects. Orihime become spiritually aware after being saved by Ichigo from Acidwire, her late brother turned into a hollow. The hollow attacks Karakura High School, but Orihime uses her own power Shun Shun Rikka to save Tatsuki Arisawa. After Rukia Kuchiki is taken back to Soul Society to be executed, Orihime joins Ichigo with Ury≈´ Ishida, Yasutora Sado and Yoruichi Shihoin, in an effort to save her. Upon arriving in Soul Society, their group is split up, and Orihime wanders the city with Ury≈´. Later on, Orihime is captured by Makiz≈ç Aramaki, a Soul Reaper of the 11th division, but is later freed by the captain Kenpachi Zaraki. After Rukia is saved by Ichigo, the group returns to the human world. Shun Shun Rikka Orihime joins the others when they deal with the Bount in anime-only episodes. Afterwards, arrancar begin to invade Karakura Town. During a battle with the Espada Yammy, the attack component of Orihime's Shun Shun Rikka is destroyed, making her unable to help in the oncoming battles. After sitting on the sidelines for the second arrancar invasion, Orihime has Tsubaki restored by Hachigen Ush≈çda, and Orihime goes to Soul Society to train for the next attack. While traveling between the two realms, she meets Ulquiorra Cifer, who threatens to kill Ichigo and her friends, unless she agrees to go to Hueco Mundo. Orihime leaves and heads to Hueco Mundo. There, Orihime is introduced to S≈çsuke Aizen, a former Soul Reaper and current leader of the Arrancar. Aizen explains that he intends to use Orihime's Shun Shun Rikka to restore the , though she decides to use her powers to destroy the Orb instead. Before she can act on her plans, Ichigo and a group of others arrive in Hueco Mundo to save her. When Ichigo is defeated while facing Ulquiorra, Grimmjow Jeagerjaques, wanting to battle Ichigo at full strength, frees Orihime from her confinements so that she can heal him. Ichigo battles with Grimmjow and ultimately claims victory. They are then attacked by Nnoitora Jiruga, but after Nnoitora's death at the hands of Kenpachi, Orihime is captured once again. Ichigo rushes to her location, and engages Ulquiorra in battle, but is once again defeated. During the aftermath, she discovers that Ichigo is transformed into a new hollow and he mortally hurts Ulquiorra. Ulquiorra starts to turn into ashes as he asks Orihime if she is afraid of him. Orihime, after saying that he is not frightening, tries to reach his hand but Ulquiorra finally disappears. As Ichigo returns to the world of the living, Orihime remains behind to heal an injured Ury≈´. After Aizen is defeated, Orihime returns to living a normal life until Ury≈´ is attacked and badly injured by a human with supernatural powers. She is later confronted by Tsukishima, the one who attacked Ury≈´, and his subordinate Shishigawara, and Tsukishima stabs her with his Fullbring before leaving. Later it is revealed that Tsukishima's power has altered her memories. Later, Orihime and her friends went to Hueco Mundo to fight off the Wandenreich, a group of Quincys seeking to destroy Soul Society led by an all powerful leader named Yhwach. Orihime and the others fight them off and liberate Hueco Mundo from one of the Wandenreich's high-ranked officers Quilge Opie. After dealing with Opie, Ichigo finds out that the Wandenreich are attacking the Soul Society. When Ichigo is defeated by Yhwach, Orihime fixes Ichigo's weapon allowing him to face him again. Ten years after Ichigo's victory, she marries Ichigo and has a son with him named Kazui. =In other media= Her character has gained additional popularity even among non-fans thanks to a short looped animation of Orihime twirling a leek (specifically, a negi, or Welsh onion) played to \\"Ievan Polkka\\". Known as the Loituma Girl, the five frames used in the flash cartoon were taken from the second episode in the anime. Orihime appears in the Bleach: Memories of Nobody, Bleach: The DiamondDust Rebellion and Bleach: Hell Verse, albeit in a minor role. She also appears in the Bleach video games such as Heat the Soul as a playable character. Orihime also stars alongside Rukia Kuchiki in the Bleach Beat Collection Season 2 with solo song \\"La La La\\" and duet song \\"Holy Fight.\\" Reception Stephanie Sheh provides the voice of Orihime Inoue in English dub. At the first Seiyu Awards in March 2007, Yuki Matsuoka was one of the winners in the category \\"Best Actresses in supporting roles\\" for her role as Orihime. The character of Orihime has been well received by readers from the manga, appearing at No. 5 in the first characters popularity poll. She did not appear in the top ten from the second (having ranked 12th), but returned in the two followings; in the 3rd poll she ranked 10th, and was 8th in the most recent, surpassing Izuru Kira by 123 votes. Various types of merchandising have been released based on Orihime's character such as plush, key chains and figurines. Pins based on her hair clips have also been released for cosplaying. Various publications for manga, anime and other media have commented on Orihime's character, adding praise to her traits and development. Mania Entertainment writer Jarred Pine liked Orihime's development in the first volume of the manga as her encounter with the hollow from her brother added \\"more dimension\\" to her character rather than her portray of a \\"big-breasted bimbo\\" in which she was initially introduced. Although Carlo Santos from Anime News Network (ANN) found her character to be stereotypical due to the way she uses her powers, he noted that (like each character) she was very interesting due to the personality she has. D. F. Smith from IGN complained on Orihime's appearances when she joins her friends to rescue Rukia Kuchiki since most of them were only comical and they were very repetitive. Stephanie Sheh was praised as one of the best voice actors from Viz Media's dub by Carl Kimlinger from ANN. Carlos Alexandre from popcultureshock.com also praised Sheh's work, noting that she makes a good interpretation from Orihime's character. In an Anime News Network poll, Orihime was voted as the fourth worst cook in anime.

CFL News in 2004 Neil Payne retired from his position as Director of Officiating in February and was replaced by George Black. Former Eskimos Head Coach, Tom Higgins was named as the 2003 Coach of the Year. CFL Commissioner Tom E. Wright, announced that Vancouver would host the 93rd Grey Cup for 2005. Furthermore, CFL Commissioner Tom E. Wright also announced in late October, that Winnipeg would be the host of the 94th Grey Cup for 2006. Wayne Smith of Appalachian State University was drafted first overall in the 2004 CFL Draft by the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. Former player, broadcaster and football administrator, Mike Wadsworth died in April. In September, the Canadian Football Hall of Fame inducted Larry Highbaugh, Cal Murphy, Lui Passaglia, Dan Yochum and Ben Zambiasi during the Induction Weekend ceremonies in Hamilton. CFL partner, Sun Microsystems added and launched real-time, in-game statistics entry with live play-by-play and scoring on cfl.ca. On June 2, the CFL announced a partnership with FSN and launched a player-based and team-based game for the 2004 season. In addition, the CFL also launched its first ever online kids section called ‚Äî the Dare CFL KidsZone. The CFL started a new international broadcasting agreement with Trajectory Sports & Media Group, to deliver Canadian Football to more than 50 million households in 176 countries for the 2004 season. U.S. television coverage of the 92nd Grey Cup resulted in the largest international broadcast distribution of a Grey Cup game ‚Äî when it was made available to more than 55 million television households. In addition, Rogers Sportsnet announced the start of \\"CFL Crunch\\", which is a 30-minute news segment concerning the league on June 24.

Records: Before he retired, Edmonton running back, Mike Pringle, established two new records in 2004. The first record was accomplished on July 12, when Pringle established a new CFL career record for yards from scrimmage with 20,254 yards in the Eskimos 25‚Äì9 win over the B.C. Lions.

Though she is not a character in the games, she has interacted with game characters such as Jill Valentine, Claire Redfield, Carlos Olivera, Chris Redfield, and Leon S. Kennedy. Alice, portrayed by Milla Jovovich, plays the principal role in each film, with the storylines mostly revolving around her campaign to bring down the Umbrella Corporation.  History In film= Resident Evil  In Resident Evil, Alice is a security officer working for the Umbrella Corporation. She and Spence Parks, posing as a married couple for cover, were placed at a mansion outside Raccoon City that is an entrance to The Hive, a functional large top secret underground laboratory owned and operated by the Umbrella Corporation, built a half mile underground. Some time before the events of the first film, Alice betrays her employers and begins to secretly work to expose them to the world, after learning of their dangerous and unethical experiments. Waking up with amnesia, she recalls nothing of this and joins Matt Addison, an environmentalist posing as a police officer, and a team of commandos who take them and venture into the Hive to investigate why the artificial intelligence computer, the Red Queen, killed all the employees. Spence is found, appearing to suffer from amnesia like Alice, and it is revealed that the memory loss was caused when a nerve gas was released into the mansion by the Red Queen, one of its countermeasures to prevent a viral outbreak from spreading. Despite working for Umbrella, it is revealed Alice was willing to expose Umbrella's dangerous and illegal experiments in order to bring the company down. She is shown to be the contact of Matt's sister, Lisa Addison, who was trying to smuggle out a sample of the T-virus; Alice tells this to Matt. However, at the end of the film, Spence, who was having a real relationship with Alice while playing the part of her husband, is revealed to have found out about her plans. Misinterpreting Alice's intention to bring Umbrella down, Spence had stolen T-Virus samples with the intent to sell them on the black market for both of them, releasing the virus in the Hive to cover their tracks. Upon abandoning the remaining survivors and getting on the train with the anti-virus, Spence is killed by the Licker which the Red Queen released from captivity. Kaplan, who disables the Red Queen and escapes with the team, is also killed by the Licker. Rain, despite being given the anti-virus had turned anyway due to her prolonged state of infection and she is eventually killed by Matt as they battle the Licker on the moving train. Alice and Matt are the only survivors to escape the Hive. Upon returning to the mansion, both are seized by Umbrella scientists and taken into quarantine at the Raccoon City Hospital. Alice awakens on an operating table in a white room with no knowledge of what has happened, heading outside, she sees the infection has ravaged Raccoon City.  Resident Evil: Apocalypse  In Resident Evil: Apocalypse, taking place sometime after the T-virus outbreak in the Hive, Umbrella reopens the facility to find out exactly what happened to the commando team they sent in the previous film, only to unleash the infected undead and viral experiments on Raccoon City, forcing the company to quarantine the city and slowly evacuate its non-infected citizens after extracting nearly all essential company personnel and their families. They also reawaken Alice, whom they had experimented on with the T-virus after capturing her (its later revealed that she had bonded with the virus on a cellular level), and let her loose in the city to observe her. Alice soon meets with Raccoon Police Department STARS officers Jill Valentine and Payton Wells and reporter Terri Morales, and saves them from attacking Lickers in a church. The group is then recruited by Umbrella researcher Dr. Charles Ashford, who offers them safe passage out of the city in exchange for locating and retrieving his daughter Angela, who went missing during the extraction of Umbrella's vital employees and their families after her security car was involved in a collision. Alice subsequently explains that Umbrella (who has since sealed the city's last exit after the virus reached it) plans to nuke Raccoon City to destroy the infection and all remaining evidence of it, while blaming the whole thing on a meltdown of the city's nuclear power plant. Shortly afterwards, Nemesis, a heavily mutated experimental supersoldier sent by Umbrella to eliminate all remaining STARS members, appears and kills Wells, and Alice is forced to break away from the group to lure it away from them. She later makes it to Angela's school and rendezvous with the group, which now includes civilian L.J. Wayne and abandoned Umbrella soldiers Carlos Olivera and Nicholai Ginovaef, the latter two of whom were also recruited by Dr. Ashford. They manage to find and rescue Angela, although Ginovaef and Morales are killed in the process. The group then makes it to Dr. Ashford's extraction point, only to be ambushed and taken captive by Umbrella forces lead by Major Timothy Cain. When Nemesis shows up, Cain forces Alice to fight it by coldly executing Dr. Ashford and threatening to do the same to the others. As they fight, Alice comes to recognize Nemesis as Matt Addison, who was also experimented on following their capture by Umbrella after having been mutated by an injury he sustained from the Licker; in turn, Nemesis regains his memories and, upon recognizing Alice, turns against Umbrella and helps her fight Cain's forces. They and the group succeed in taking down said forces and seizing the helicopter, but Nemesis is killed protecting Alice. As the survivors make their escape, Alice throws Cain from the helicopter, leaving him to be killed and devoured by the approaching zombie horde, including a now-zombified Dr. Ashford. As the survivors reach the outskirts of Raccoon City, the nuclear bomb detonates over the city, and the resulting blast wave causes the helicopter to crash. The turbulence causes a metal pole to be thrown towards Angela, but Alice takes the blow and is impaled, and then killed in the crash. Her body is later retrieved by Umbrella researcher Dr. Alexander Isaacs, who takes her to a research facility in Detroit. Three weeks later, Alice wakes up in the facility and escapes with help from Olivera, Valentine, L.J., and Angela. As they escape, Dr. Alexander Isaacs, a high-ranking Umbrella employee, reveals that Alice's escape is part of Umbrella's plan for her.  Resident Evil: Extinction  In Resident Evil: Extinction, five years after the incident of the Hive, the world has succumbed to the T-virus. Alice stays on the move to avoid capture by the Umbrella Corporation after she learned Umbrella could track and control her through satellites. She left the group to protect them, using the satellites trajectories to stay off the grid. On her travels she finds a journal detailing the possibility of Alaska as a sanctuary, isolated from the rest of the T-virus infested world. However, the Umbrella Corporation is utilizing the White Queen, a more advanced artificial intelligence computer that is able to find Alice. Early in the film, she uses her mental powers to save Claire Redfield's Convoy ‚Äî the convoy which L.J. and Carlos have since joined. However, in doing so, the massive psionic activity produced by Alice is detected by the White Queen through their Umbrella satellites, and Isaacs is then made aware of her location. The leaders of the convoy decide to make the trip to Alaska, but first refuel in Las Vegas. Isaacs decides to go after Alice, defying orders from Umbrella Chairman Albert Wesker. During a battle between the zombies and survivors, Isaacs attempts to shut down Alice, causing the Umbrella logo to flash in her eyes again as the satellite network requires her. As Alice is frozen in place, she is able to overcome the control by \\"frying\\" the satellite's processor through her advanced mental powers. She then goes after Isaacs, but he manages to escape, however, not before being bitten by an advanced version of a zombie which he had tried to domesticate using blood samples from Alice's clones (which Isaacs, as seen at the beginning of the film, had been testing for any similarities to the authentic Alice's physical and mental capabilities). Those left head to the Umbrella base and the now-infected Carlos briefly kisses Alice before driving an oil truck loaded with dynamite into a horde of zombies to clear the way. The convoy leaves on helicopter while Alice stays behind. She meets with the White Queen who informs her that the cure to the infection would lie in Alice's blood. Alice pursues Isaacs into the lower levels, even seeing a clone of herself, but is soon attacked by Isaacs, who has since mutated into a monster called \\"the Tyrant\\". The clone awakens, seemingly dying soon after. Alice follows Isaacs into a replica of the mansion from the first film. The two fight, both using telekinesis, and eventually make their way into the laser room, also from the first film. The lasers cut Isaacs into pieces and just as Alice is going to meet the same fate, the lasers dissipate, turned off by Alice's clone. Afterwards Alice, via holographic technology, interrupts a meeting between Wesker and the other Umbrella executives. She tells them that she is coming after them and will bring \\"a few friends.\\" Standing beside the awakened clone, they look out into a room filled with hundreds more, and as other clones begin to wake, the film ends.  Resident Evil: Afterlife  In Resident Evil: Afterlife, taking place 18 months after Resident Evil: Extinction, Alice and her clones invade an Umbrella underground facility located in Tokyo, Japan, in order to eliminate the corporation and Albert Wesker. Wesker gets injured by grenades released by an Alice clone, but is immediately healed after and then he escapes and activates a bomb that destroys the facility and all of the clones. The real Alice escapes from the Tokyo facility by hiding on the helicopter that Wesker is on. Wesker injects Alice with a serum that seemingly deprives her of all her superhuman powers, including her telekinesis, while demonstrating that he has developed similar abilities due to exposure to the T-Virus. Alice thanks him for this, as she is now fully human again. Just right before Wesker shoots the now defenseless Alice, the helicopter crashes into a mountain. Thanks to her not-yet-fully- disappeared superhuman powers, Alice survives the crash. After barely escaping with her life, six months pass. Alice flies to Alaska to find the chopper from Umbrella completely deserted, and the book that she gave K-Mart in Resident Evil: Extinction. She then finds Claire Redfield beaten up in the woods, wearing a mind control apparatus called a Scarab, that Umbrella forced onto her chest. Alice removes the Scarab and finds out that Claire has lost all of her memory due to a drug it was injecting her with. They then fly together to Los Angeles Prison, where they stumble upon Claire's brother Chris Redfield and other survivors: Bennett, Angel, Wendell, Kim Young, Crystal, and Luther West. As they try to get out of the prison when the zombies invade, Bennett kills Angel out of frustration, then escapes by himself with Alice's plane. Crystal and Wendell get killed by zombies, and an Axeman (The Executioner from the fifth video game) chops Kim Young in half, leaving only Chris, Claire, Alice, and Luther in the prison. Claire and Alice kills Axeman and then escapes with Chris and Luther, using the prison's sewer systems. On the way, Luther is attacked and presumably killed by a zombie. Alice travels with Chris and Claire Redfield to an abandoned oil tanker, the \\"Arcadia\\", that is broadcasting a message stating that it's infection free. This is, however, revealed to be a trap by Umbrella to lure in survivors so that they can be experimented on, with K-Mart being among these captives. They find Albert Wesker waiting for them, who reveals that he has been periodically consuming humans to stabilize the T-Virus‚Äôs effects on him. In the final battle, Alice, along with Claire and Chris, face Wesker, whose powers prove too much for Claire and Chris and he locks them up. However, Alice, with the help of a recently freed K-Mart, defeats Wesker and apparently kills him with a shot to the head. Wesker somehow survives even though his head is blown open and Claire and Chris unload their pistols into him. Later, Wesker completely regenerates from his wounds by consuming Bennett and escapes on a helicopter, then activates a bomb. However, Alice has placed the bomb on Wesker's chopper and it explodes. Afterward, a parachute is seen in the air after its explosion. Unbeknownst to the group, Luther survives his zombie attack in the tunnel, and staggers out from a massive drainage pipe. After releasing all of the survivors on the Arcadia, Alice decides to turn it into a real sanctuary and broadcasts a message giving the ship's location and that it's infection- free before spotting a massive fleet of Umbrella helicopters heading their way loaded with soldiers. The fleet is revealed to be led by her former comrade and fellow Raccoon City survivor Jill Valentine, who is under the control of a Scarab.  Resident Evil: Retribution  In Resident Evil: Retribution, Umbrella forces reach Arcadia and open fire on the survivors. Alice fights in the battle aboard Arcadia and was injured in the destruction of a Umbrella osprey, leaving her thrown overboard. The fates of Claire, Chris and K-Mart remain unknown. Recovered from the waters by the Umbrella Corporation, Alice is taken to a bio weapons testing facility known as Umbrella Prime. When Alice wakes, Jill Valentine begins an interrogation. After several unsuccessful attempts, the power unexpectedly goes out, allowing Alice to escape from her cell. After escaping a laser grid defense measure, Alice finds herself in a simulation of Tokyo, where she battles a horde of zombies that include Japan's patient zero. About to be overwhelmed, Alice flees through a door that leads back into the facility and enters the Operations Center only to find the personnel dead. Alice encounters Ada Wong - immediately recognizing her as the associate of Wesker. Wesker appears on a monitor and Ada explains that she and Wesker no longer work for Umbrella as the supercomputer Red Queen has taken over the Umbrella Corporation. While Alice wants to blast her way out of a window to escape, Ada reveals to her that they are located beneath an ice field. Wesker informs Alice that he has sent her help in the form of a team led by Leon Kennedy. They set out to reach the suburban recreation of Raccoon City after a brief conversation with the Red Queen, who promptly threatens them that they are going to die. Alice and Ada are able to reach the simulation of Raccoon City after a brief battle in the New York simulation against two Axemen. During their trip, Alice locates a young girl named Becky who believes Alice is her mother. Alice recognizes the girl from her memories of the clone's experience and vows to protect her. While trying to escape the house, the group encounters Jill and a group of soldiers, including Alice's clones and clones of Alice's former allies: Rain Ocampo, Carlos Olivera, and James 'One' Sharpe. A shootout occurs, resulting in Ada's capture and Alice and Becky's escape. Entering the Moscow simulation, they encounter a second clone of Rain, who Alice asks to look after Becky as she goes forward to meet the rescue team. Alice enters the Moscow environment and rescues the group from a collection of Las Plagas undead and a Licker. They return to Becky and Rain to escape. With time to spare the team reaches the elevators; however, the Licker captures Becky while Jill and the clones return and open fire. Alice pursues the Licker to rescue Becky, finding her in a cocoon with the Licker. Alice disables the Licker and rescues Becky. After she recovers explosives, Alice and Becky travel through a tunnel and find the cloning chamber, where they find hundreds of clones of themselves. Alice reassures the girl that she is her mother and they are again attacked by the Licker. Using the explosives from earlier, Alice destroys the Licker and escapes with the child. They reach the surface and reunite with the rescue team while Umbrella Prime floods beneath them when the explosives go off. Shortly afterward the rescue team is intercepted by a surviving Jill and her enforcer, the clone of Rain. While Rain fights Leon and Luther, Jill and Alice fight. Despite being severely injured, Alice manages to break the Scarab free from Jill's chest and frees her from the Red Queen's influence. Alice joins Leon in fighting Rain - who has injected herself with a Las Plagas parasite - but both are overpowered by the enhanced clone. After being severely injured by a hit to her chest, Alice notices a collection of Plaga undead beneath the ice. With the help of the freed Jill, Alice stops Rain by breaking the ice beneath her feet. A rescue vehicle arrives to save them, but Alice collapses from her injuries. When she awakens, Alice is taken to the Oval Office in the White House. Escorted into the room alone, Alice finds herself facing Wesker. He immediately injects her with a serum seemingly returns her superhuman abilities. He informs her he has returned her gift in exchange for her help in defeating the Red Queen, who is set on destroying all that remains of humanity. She vows to kill him for what he's done to her and he taunts her by showing her the waves of undead that wait outside the White House barricades, claiming she is the weapon to prevent humanities impending extinction at the hands of Umbrella and the Red Queen.  Resident Evil: The Final Chapter  In Resident Evil: The Final Chapter, flashbacks reveal that Dr. James Marcus, the original founder of the Umbrella Corporation, had a daughter who was dying of premature aging. Desperate to save her, Marcus developed the T-virus as a way to cure all diseases on Earth. After having had his creation taken away from him, Marcus' business partner Dr. Alexander Isaacs tried to convince Marcus to use the T-virus for military purposes. When he refused, Isaacs ordered Albert Wesker to kill Marcus. Alice awakens in the now-ruined White House, after being betrayed once again by Wesker. While searching for survivors, the Red Queen (Ever Gabo Anderson) appears and tells Alice that she must return to the Hive in Raccoon City within 48 hours, where the Umbrella Corporation has developed an airborne antivirus, which will kill every organism infected by the T-virus, before the remainder of humankind is wiped out. When asked why she is betraying her creators, the Red Queen simply says that she will tell Alice once she arrives at The Hive. On her way to Raccoon City, Alice is captured by Isaacs, whose clone Alice previously killed, but she manages to escape his convoy. Alice later arrives in the now-destroyed Raccoon City and is captured by a group of survivors, consisting of Doc, Abigail, Christian, Cobalt, Razor, and Claire Redfield, who is revealed to be alive after the attack on Arcadia. After learning that a group of armored vehicles and a horde of zombies is coming their way, the group prepares to make their last stand. They manage to defeat the enemy forces, although Cobalt is killed in the process. The group later realizes that a second horde is coming in their direction. With no defenses left, Alice and the crew decide to get to the Hive entrance, located at the bottom of the atomic bomb crater which destroyed the city. However, Wesker, having taken control of the Hive, releases mutated guard dogs, killing Christian. Upon arriving at the Hive, the Red Queen appears to Alice and explains the reason for her betrayal. She reveals that a video was uploaded to her program which contained the recording of the Umbrella executives, including Isaacs, having a meeting regarding the world, formulating a plan to release the T-virus in order to cleanse the world, save the rich and powerful with cryogenic capsules hidden in the Hive, and later rebuild the world in their image. The Red Queen, although programmed to never hurt an Umbrella employee, was also programmed to value human life, which is why she enlisted Alice's help to stop Isaacs. The Red Queen warns Alice about one of the group being a spy for Umbrella. Entering the Hive, the group encounters several obstacles, and Abigail and Razor are killed. After planting bombs around the Hive, Alice confronts the real Isaacs, while she and Claire are captured by Wesker and Doc, Umbrella's spy. A cryogenic capsule opens, revealing Alicia Marcus, Umbrella's co-leader and Marcus' daughter; Alice is revealed to be a clone of Alicia. Isaacs plans to eliminate Alicia and gain full control of Umbrella, but Alicia \\"fires\\" Wesker, which signals the Red Queen to crush his legs with a security door. Doc tries to shoot Alice, but his gun is empty ‚Äì as Alice had deduced his treachery earlier ‚Äì and he is killed by Claire. Encouraged by Alicia's words, Alice and Claire fight Isaacs, who is eventually killed by his own clone ‚Äì the one Alice had encountered en route to the city ‚Äì and Alice releases the antivirus, killing the undead. The bombs planted within the Hive explode, killing everyone inside, including Alicia, all the frozen Umbrella employees, and Wesker. Claire later wakes Alice, who survived as the antivirus killed the T-virus within Alice's body. The Red Queen gives Alice an upload of all of Alicia's memories of childhood. Some time later, Alice travels to Manhattan, stating that the antivirus may take several years to reach all corners of the globe and until then, her mission is not finished. = In literature = Alice appears in the three novelizations of the films. The novels, for the most part, retell the events of the films in greater detail and provide some additional information. In the novels, such concepts as Alice's surname and her real name, Janus Prospero, are presented. In the films it is never revealed if Alice remembers any of her past beyond the flashbacks seen in Resident Evil. The novels explain in greater detail her relationships. The first focuses on her relationship with Spence while the third mentions her possible relationship with ex-U.B.C.S soldier, Carlos Olivera. In the third novel it is revealed that Carlos does have feelings for her and that some of Alice's thoughts rest on him while she is away from him.  Concept and creation  Alice was an original character created for the films, although writer Paul W.S. Anderson noted that Alice was based on the strong women in the Resident Evil games. Anderson initially toyed with the idea of the film being an allegory to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, but the idea was not followed through completely. Despite this, the film contains various references to the work, which included Alice's name.Resident Evil DVD audio commentary with Paul W.S. Anderson, Jeremy Bolt, Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez Milla Jovovich has stated she wanted the character to be \\"the female Dirty Harry.\\"https://uproxx.com/hitfix/resident-evil-alice-women-in-action- movies/ Although the name Alice was given as the character's name prior to Resident Evil's release and is listed in the credits, her name is not actually spoken in the first film, it is first spoken in Resident Evil: Apocalypse. Also in Apocalypse, at the end of the film, Jill Valentine and Carlos Olivera, posing as Umbrella personnel, produce an identification document in which Alice is called Janus Prospero. A promotional document released by Screen Gems called The Raccoon City Times further confirm that Alice is a nickname and Janus Prospero is the character's real name. However, in the novelization of Resident Evil: Apocalypse, her name is Alice Abernathy. = Characteristics = In Resident Evil, Alice is depicted as suffering from amnesia. In Resident Evil: Apocalypse, her character is portrayed as tough and rugged, as she is more familiar with the situation surrounding her. She plays a similar role in Resident Evil: Extinction. Since then she has been an \\"iconic figure and is closely associated with the series,\\" becoming far more skilled and rugged since her first appearance. She is primarily portrayed in Apocalypse and Extinction as \\"a supremely efficient killing machine\\" and bio-weapon, while in the first film, she is shown first recognizing her abilities as a highly trained yet human security operative. Alice's superhuman abilities, as well as the use of various styles of martial arts and gun play have made her an almost super hero style of character and has one \\"cheering for her instead of wondering how the hell she managed to suddenly become Spider-Man.\\" For example, in Extinction, after her exposure to the T-virus, she displayed psychic powers and was able to use those powers to kill a security guard with a glance (through a monitor he was watching her on). She also had the ability to jump long distances, as seen in her initial confrontation with Nemesis. In Extinction, her powers, especially her telekinetic powers, had developed further, (however, she still experiences blackouts and massive headaches if she pushes her powers too far). As of Resident Evil: Afterlife, Alice has had all of her superhuman abilities taken away from her by the T-Virus via the serum Chairman Wesker injected her with by disabling her T-Virus cells, though her military like training still gives her a combat edge when dealing with bioweapons. =Weapons= Alice has shown a supreme level of ability with all sorts of weapons. In each film she is shown using a number of weapons, but only a few function as her principal tools of death. The first film was the only one where she only used what weapons she could salvage, as she had amnesia and wasn't armed properly. In Apocalypse, she used a Mossberg 500 shotgun and a pair of Heckler & Koch MP5K submachine guns and Para-Ordnance P-14 pistols as her main weapons. In Extinction, she carried two Para-Ordnance Nite-Tac pistols, Mossberg 500 shotgun and a pair of Kukri knives, and used them to great effect. They were shown but never used in Afterlife, where Alice had many clones besides herself. The Alice clones in the beginning mainly used straight-bladed odachi blades and Br√ºgger & Thomet MP-9's. The original Alice preferred to use a pair of 10-gauge double-barrelled shotguns (oddly loaded with quarters, killing zombies with American currency in Afterlife) and a pair of Smith & Wesson Model 460V revolvers.

One of the largest German academic libraries, it has numerous national as well as international projects in librarianship and in the provision of research infrastructure services. In the year 2002, the SUB G√∂ttingen won the German Library of the Year (Bibliothek des Jahres) award.Bibliothek des Jahres 2002: Nieders√§chsische Staats- und Universit√§tsbibliothek G√∂ttingen. Its current director is Wolfram Horstmann. The library works under a dispersed system, with six branch libraries located in various academic departments, supplementing the central collection housed in the Central Library (construction completed in 1992) on the main campus and the Historical Library Building in downtown. The Historical Building holds manuscripts, rare books, maps, and a significant history-of-science collection and works in its special collections. In addition, its original core, the SS. Peter and Paul's Church, G√∂ttingen, has been made into an exhibition and lecture center through adaptive reuse and reconstruction. As of December 2016, the SUB G√∂ttingen holds some 8 million media units, among which are 5.9 million volumes, 1.6 million microforms, 50,000 licensed electronic journals as well as 126,000 further digital media, 327,000 maps and more than 14,000 manuscripts, 3,100 incunabula and 400 Nachl√§sse (literary remains).Deutsche Bibliotheksstatistik (German Library Statistics) 2016.. It possesses a Gutenberg Bible (one of only four perfect vellum copies known to exist). The SUB G√∂ttingen has maintained the G√∂ttingen Center for Retrospective Digitization (GDZ) since 1997. It also operates the G√∂ttingen University Press, which has been expanding since its foundation in 2003 and is committed to the Open access principle. Since its establishment in 2004, the library's Department for Research and Development has been instrumental in the development of new services such as the establishment of virtual research environments and infrastructures for scientific data and services. Within the framework of the Collection of German Prints, the SUB G√∂ttingen collects publications of the 18th century. Within the Specialised Information Services Programme funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG), it operates the specialised information services Mathematics (since 2015, with the German National Library of Science and Technology (TIB Hannover)), Anglo-American Culture (since 2016, with the Library of the J. F. Kennedy Institute of the Free University of Berlin), Geosciences of the Solid Earth (since 2016, with the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ Potsdam)) and Finno-Ugric / Uralic Languages, Literature and Culture (since 2017). In cooperation with the University Library \\"Georgius Agricola\\" of the Technische Universit√§t Bergakademie Freiberg (UBF), the SUB G√∂ttingen maintains a large online collection of geoscience-related materials, the GEO- Library Experts Online, or GEO-LEO. The SUB G√∂ttingen coordinates the establishment of a nationwide competence center for the licensing of electronic resources (together with the Berlin State Library and the Head Office of the Common Library Network (GBV). Since 2014, it has operated the G√∂ttingen eResearch Alliance (together with the University Computing Centre (GWDG). The library coordinates the DARIAH-DE project for the development of research infrastructures in Germany, and supports the consortial establishment of open access research infrastructures (OpenAIRE 2020, COAR) across Europe and worldwide.  History  The Library was founded in 1734, three years before the university. Its first director was Johann Matthias Gesner, who remained in the position until his death in 1763. It soon was considered one of the leading research libraries in Germany, pioneering cataloging systems (then in large bound volumes). Christian Gottlob Heyne's directorship (1763-1812) laid the basis for the library's status. However, a half century of reduced financing then weakened the library's status. Only in 1866, with official Prussian sponsorship, did the library again begin to flourish. Both Heinrich Heine and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe used and commented on the library in their time.

As of the 21st century, the only countries in the world with a republican form of government and with Christianity as the established religion are Argentina, Costa Rica, Finland, Greece, Armenia, Samoa, Iceland, and Malta. Some other republics, such as Georgia, Peru, Guatemala, Panama, El Salvador, and Paraguay, give some credit or preference to Christianity, but without establishing it as the religion of the state. Others, such as Hungary, and Zambia, describe themselves as Christian countries. In A Letter Concerning Toleration, Locke wrote that \\"there is absolutely no such thing, under the Gospel, as a Christian Commonwealth\\". By this he meant that political authority cannot be validly founded upon Christianity. Rousseau, in On the Social Contract (in book 4, chapter 8), echoed this, saying that \\"I am mistaken in saying 'a Christian republic'; the two words are mutually exclusive.\\". However, Rousseau's point was subtly different, in that he was asserting that a civic identity cannot be moulded out of Christianity. David Walsh, founder of the National Institute on Media and the Family, acknowledges that there is a \\"genuine tension ... between Christianity and the political order\\" that Rousseau was acknowledging, arguing that \\"many Christians would, after all, agree with him that a 'Christian republic' is a contradiction in terms\\" and that the two live \\"in an uneasy relationship in actual states, and social cohesion has often been bought at the price of Christian universalism\\". Robert Neelly Bellah has observed that most of the great republican theorists of the Western world have shared Rousseau's concerns about the mutually exclusive nature of republicanism and Christianity, from Machiavelli (more on which later) to Alexis de Tocqueville. Rousseau's thesis is that the two are incompatible because they make different demands upon the virtuous man. Christianity, according to Rousseau, demands submission (variously termed \\"servitude\\" or \\"slavery\\" by scholars of his work) to imposed authority and resignation, and requires focus upon the unworldly; whereas republicanism demands participation rather than submission, and requires focus upon the worldly. Rousseau's position on Christianity is not universally held. Indeed, it was refuted by, amongst others, his friend Antoine-Jacques Roustan in a reply to the Social Contract. Rousseau's thesis has a basis in the prior writings of Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, whom Rousseau called a \\"bon citoyen et honn√™te homme\\" and who alongside Montesquieu was one of Rousseau's sources for republican philosophy. In his Discoursi Machiavelli observes that Christianity in practice has not met the ideals of its foundation, and that the resultant corruption leads, when mixed with secular political ideals, to something that is neither good religion nor good politics. Further, he argues, whilst Christianity does not preclude love for one's country, it does require citizens to endure damage to republican government, stating that the best civic virtue in regards to a republic is to show no mercy to the republic's enemies and to put to death or to enslave the inhabitants of an opposing city that has been defeated. Calvinist republics While the classical writers had been the primary ideological source for the republics of Italy, in Northern Europe, the Protestant Reformation would be used as justification for establishing new republics.Finer, Samuel. The History of Government from the Earliest Times. Oxford University Press, 1999. pg. 1020. Most important was Calvinist theology, which developed in the Swiss Confederacy, one of the largest and most powerful of the medieval republics. John Calvin did not call for the abolition of monarchy, but he advanced the doctrine that the faithful had the right to overthrow irreligious monarchs.\\"Republicanism.\\" Encyclopedia of the Enlightenment pg. 435 Calvinism also espoused egalitarianism and an opposition to hierarchy. Advocacy for republics appeared in the writings of the Huguenots during the French Wars of Religion.\\"Introduction.\\" Republicanism: a Shared European Heritage. By Martin van Gelderen and Quentin Skinner. Cambridge University Press, 2002 pg. 1 Calvinism played an important role in the republican revolts in England and the Netherlands. Like the city- states of Italy and the Hanseatic League, both were important trading centres, with a large merchant class prospering from the trade with the New World. Large parts of the population of both areas also embraced Calvinism. During the Dutch Revolt (beginning in 1566), the Dutch Republic emerged from rejection of Spanish Habsburg rule. However, the country did not adopt the republican form of government immediately: in the formal declaration of independence (Act of Abjuration, 1581), the throne of king Philip, was only declared vacant, and the Dutch magistrates asked the Duke of Anjou, queen Elizabeth of England and prince William of Orange, one after another, to replace Philip. It took until 1588 before the Estates (the Staten, the representative assembly at the time) decided to vest the sovereignty of the country in itself. In 1641 the English Civil War began. Spearheaded by the Puritans and funded by the merchants of London, the revolt was a success, and led to the Commonwealth of England and the execution of King Charles I. In England James Harrington, Algernon Sidney, and John Milton became some of the first writers to argue for rejecting monarchy and embracing a republican form of government. The English Commonwealth was short lived, and the monarchy soon restored. The Dutch Republic continued in name until 1795, but by the mid-18th century the stadtholder had become a de facto monarch. Calvinists were also some of the earliest settlers of the British and Dutch colonies of North America.

He also served as President of the Brooklyn Dodgers from 1898 to 1925. Biography Ebbets was born in New York City at his parents‚Äô home at 31 Clarke Street on October 29, 1859.Brooklyn Daily Eagle, January 2, 1898, p. 22. New York City city directory, 1859, p. 257. His obituary in the New York Times, 19 April 1925, p. 26, reported that he was, ‚ÄúBorn on Oct. 29, 1858, in New York City, at the corner of Spring and Clark Streets, Greenwich Village.‚Äù In his documentary on Baseball, Ken Burns misidentifies Charlie‚Äôs father as Daniel Ebbets (1785‚Äì1855), a Wall Street banker; that Daniel was of a generation earlier than Charlie‚Äôs actual father. His father actually was John B. Ebbets (ca. 1824‚ÄìMarch 16, 1888), a tavern owner on the corner of Hudson and Dominick Streets in lower Manhattan.New York City city directory, 1859, p. 257. John was of the fifth generation of the Ebbets family in New York City, a descendant of Daniel Ebbets (September 14, 1665‚Äìafter 1724), a brickmaker who had arrived in New York from England in 1700.The Burghers of New Amsterdam and the Freemen of New York, 1675‚Äì1866, Collections of the New York Historical Society, vol. 18 (1885), p. 74. Isaac Newton Phelps Stokes, The Iconography of Manhattan Island, vol. 4, p. 445. Also, Steele, Edward E., Ebbets: The History and Genealogy of a New York Family (St. Louis, Missouri, Edward E. Steele, 2013). His mother, Anna Maria Quick (ca. 1824‚ÄìJuly 8, 1871), was in the fifth generation of a Dutch family that had been in New York since the 1640s.Quick Arthur Craig, A Genealogy of the Quick Family in America (South Haven, Mich.: Arthur C. Quick, n.d.). Ebbets first attended Public School 39 on Clark Street but left that school when his father moved to Astoria shortly after 1871. Following his schooling, he took up residence at 154 Alexander Avenue near 135th.New York City directories, 1881‚Äì1884. His first job was with Dick & Fitzgerald, a publishing firm at 18 Ann Street in Manhattan. He then began work as an architect with the firm of William T. Beer. His work there as a draftsman and building designer would serve him well in later years when he decided to build a baseball stadium. He next became a bookkeeper with Frank Leslie's publishing house, a job he kept until he turned his attention to baseball. Ebbets was not only a baseball person, as he also was a fan of bowling. He was a member of the Prospect Club, the Carleton Club, and the Commonwealth Council team of the Royal Arcanum Bowling League. In 1889 he played with the Stars of South Brooklyn and the Lincoln Council Bowlers. The following year he joined the Prospects, the arch-rivals of the Lincoln Council team, and was elected their captain. In 1893, his bowling average was 170 in more than fifty games. That year the Brooklyn Eagle stated, ‚ÄúHe is considered one of the swiftest and, at the same time, truest bowlers in Brooklyn.‚ÄùBrooklyn Daily Eagle, October 9, 1893, p. 8. Brooklyn American Bowling Congress. Ebbets was prominent in the early days of organized ten-pin bowling. Accessed via Newspapers.com. In 1883, his brother Jack had introduced him to Joseph Doyle and George Taylor, friends of his who had recently formed the Brooklyn Base Ball Association with Ferdinand Abell and Charles Byrne. Ebbets got a job working for the team selling tickets, score cards, and peanuts at their Washington Park stadium at Fifth Avenue and Third Street. He printed the score cards himself. In 1891 the Brooklyn Bridegrooms (as they were then known) moved to a larger field called Eastern Park. Several years later, they had to move again, this time to the 18,000-seat ‚ÄúWashington Park 2nd‚Äù at the original site. On the afternoon of April 30, 1898, the first game was played at the new Washington Park. The Brooklyn Daily Eagle wrote the following day, ‚ÄúThe ball season is on in Brooklyn‚Äîinaugurated at the new grounds in South Brooklyn yesterday before a crowd of 15,000.‚ÄùBrooklyn Daily Eagle, May 1, 1898, p. 33. The Eagle also reported that ‚ÄúThe heart of the fan to-day is heavy as lead,‚Äù as Brooklyn lost to the Philadelphia Phillies, 6‚Äì4. During that 1898 season, he served as field manager for 106 games, compiling a 38-68 record. By 1890, he had saved enough money to make an investment in the team, and he continued to buy stock whenever he could. That same year, the Bridegrooms won the National League pennant in their first year in the league. In January 1898, he owned 80 percent of the stock, the other 20 percent being held by the club's then president, Charles H. Byrne. In reporting his controlling interest, the New York Times reported, ‚ÄúMr. Ebbets is thirty-eight years old. He signed with the club in 1882, when it was in the Inter-State League. He has been Treasurer ever since, and has handled every dollar that came into the club in fifteen years.‚ÄùNew York Times, January 2, 1898, p. 2. Byrne died three days later and Ebbets was elected president of the ball club on January 13, 1898.New York Times, January 13, 1898, p. 4. In 1899, the Superbas won the National League pennant, their second in nine years. They would win the pennant the following year. He knew that the Washington Park site would not do for the game of baseball that he envisioned. It was a wooden structure and subject, therefore, to fire and significant maintenance. It was also located in South Brooklyn, near several factories and a canal whose unpleasant odors (and factory smoke) permeated the air. Scouting around Brooklyn for an alternate site, his attention soon focused on an area in Flatbush known as ‚ÄúPigtown‚Äù‚Äîso called because it was a local dump occupied principally by squatters. A major part of its attraction was that nine separate trolley car lines converged near the site. Ebbets had already learned that it was important to get the fans to the game. He quietly began to purchase individual lots in Pigtown over a four-year period. By 1911 he had acquired 5¬Ω acres of land for the bargain price of $100,000.G. Edward White, Creating the National Pastime: Baseball Transforms Itself, 1903‚Äì1953, Princeton University Press, 1996, p. 17. In 1912, he sold half of his holdings in the Superbas to raise the $750,000 needed to build a new stadium and construction of the Superbas‚Äô new 25,000-seat stadium at 55 Sullivan Place near the intersection of Empire Boulevard (called Malbone Street at the time) and Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn was completed and Ebbets Field opened for its first ballgame. Following an exhibition game on April 5 in which the Superbas beat the Yankees 3‚Äì2, opening day of April 9, 1913, saw a packed house witness the Philadelphia Phillies defeat the Superbas 1‚Äì0. Not only was he now a half- owner and president of the Brooklyn Superbas Baseball Club in the National League, he also had a stadium named in his honor. In addition to his service to the Brooklyn Dodgers, he was politically active. He served as a Democratic assemblyman representing the Twelfth District in the New York State legislature in 1896.Brooklyn Daily Eagle, December 20, 1895, p. 9. The following year, in a Republican landslide when William McKinley won the White House, Ebbets lost his bid for re-election. In November 1897, he won election to the Municipal Council of Greater New York from his district in Brooklyn.New York Times, November 4, 1897, p. 1; Brooklyn Daily Eagle, November 4, 1897, p. 4; Brooklyn Daily Eagle, January 28, 1899, and New York Times, 29 January 1899, in which Ebbets‚Äô seat is confirmed by the Supreme Court, with a plurality of 12 votes. His term in the council ran for four years until 1901. The next year he decided to run as a Democratic candidate from Brooklyn for the New York state Senate. He ran in the election of 1904 but was defeated by 777 votes.New York Times, November 9, 1904, p. 5. That loss ended his political aspirations. Charles married first April 10, 1878, Minnie Frances Amelia Broadbent, born January 1, 1858, in New York City. Minnie was the daughter of English parents James Broadbent and Amelia Preston. They were married at Trinity Church by Rev. Thomas H. Sill.New York City marriage certificate, 1878, no. 1935. Also, Trinity Church marriage register. Charles, at age 18, was nearly two years younger than his 20-year-old bride. About 1903, he was invited to a poker game at the Hotel Somerset on West 47th Street in New York City. The hotel was operated by a friend, Claude R. Nott. While at the game, he met Claude's wife, Grace, and apparently became infatuated with her. When Nott determined that his wife was being unfaithful to him he sued for divorce. Claude and Grace Nott's divorce was finalized on January 6, 1909.The New York Sun, January 6, 1909, p. 1. By 1910 he and Minnie had apparently separated, as Minnie was then living at 214 Parkside Avenue in Brooklyn.1910 U.S. census, Brooklyn, Kings Co., New York, ward 29, ED 9218, p. 7A (p. 122). By 1915, Ebbets was living with Grace Slade at 1466 Avenue G in Brooklyn.1915 New York state census, Brooklyn, Kings Co., New York, ward 31, p. 53. In 1916, his team (known as the Robins due to their manager, Wilbert Robinson) won the National League pennant (their first in sixteen years), advancing to the 1916 World Series. They lost to the Boston Red Sox in five games. Four years later, the Robins won the pennant again, though they once again lost in the World Series, this time to the Cleveland Indians in seven games. Final years and death In September 1919, Minnie sued for divorce.New York Times, October 23, 1919, p. 17. The following year he and Minnie made an out-of-court settlement establishing an alimony payment to her of $6,500 per year for twelve years.Brooklyn Daily Eagle, January 9, 1920, p. 2. Their divorce was finalized in January 1922.New York Times, January 11, 1922, p. 7. Brooklyn Daily Eagle, January 27, 1922, p. 2. Minnie received an annual allowance of $7,500 and to guarantee those payments he deposited his shares of the Dodgers with the Mechanics Bank in Brooklyn as trustee. On May 8, 1922, he married Grace Slade as his second wife in Bridgeport, Connecticut.S. passport application, November 16, 1922, no. 231312. Brooklyn Daily Eagle, May 9, 1922, p. 2. New York Times, May 10, 1922, p. 16. In 1924, he and Grace had a house built in Clearwater, Florida, and he moved the Dodgers to that town to practice in the spring. The following year, he and Grace again went to Clearwater to attend spring training for the Dodgers. Returning to New York in April, Ebbets checked into his room at the Waldorf- Astoria Hotel where he stayed when the Dodgers were playing in town. He didn't feel well and was confined to his room for two weeks. Early on the morning of April 18, 1925, he fell into a deep sleep and awoke only briefly. Charles H. Ebbets died of heart failure that afternoon in his suite at the Waldorf Hotel.New York City death certificate, 1925, no. 10675. A showman even in death, his occupation on his death certificate is listed as ‚ÄúBaseBall Magnate.‚Äù The exact cause of Charlie‚Äôs death was listed as ‚Äúchronic valvular disease of heart.‚Äù He was 65 years old. His funeral was held at Trinity Church on April 21 and he was buried at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn.Green-Wood Cemetery burial record, Section 129, Lot 35567. That day all baseball games in the National League were canceled in his honor and the flags at all of the National League baseball parks would fly at half-staff for the next 30 days. Legacy Ebbets was a hands-on baseball owner who introduced numerous concepts into the game that still live on in some form in the present day. His first concept was Ladies Day in 1899, in which women were admitted into the ballpark for a reduced fee. He also helped in changing the length of the Major League Baseball schedule from 140 to 154 in 1904, based on the distances required to visit each club in the league. In 1906, he helped in the installation of separate batting and fielding practices for his Dodger team and the visiting team along with separate dressing rooms with lockers and running water (at the time, the visiting team came dressed from their hotel before arriving at the ballpark, often getting jeered or pelted by the home fans). He also came up with the \\"rain check\\" in 1911, in which a detached portion of the ticket could be used in the event of a rain-out. Two years later, he came up with the idea for the player's draft, in which the team with the worst record gets the first picks in the draft.https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/12f35f52 During an exhibition game in Memphis on March 28, 1917 between his team and the Boston Red Sox, the two teams wore numbers on their sleeves due to his belief that fans in a non-major league city like Memphis wouldn't be familiar with the players. He proposed having all teams to put numbers on the players' sleeves or caps during a National League meeting on December 13, 1922, but it was left to the discretion of the teams (the practice of numbers on uniforms did not come into popularity until 1929). In 1925, he persuaded others to adopt as a permanent rule the 2‚Äì3‚Äì2 pattern used in the previous World Series. This format is still used today.Boxerman, Burton A. and Benita W., Ebbets to Veeck to Busch, (McFarland & Co., Jefferson, N.C., 2003), pp. 10‚Äì12. When he built Ebbets Field, he said, ‚ÄúLater I hope the players will capture a pennant, to make the combination complete.‚ÄùLeslie‚Äôs Weekly, April 4, 1912. During his lifetime, he saw two pennants (1916 and 1920) while playing under the field that bore his name, although he never saw a World Series title. The Dodgers did not win a World Series until 1955. Five years after the title (and three years after the team left Brooklyn), his stadium was demolished. The Ebbets Field Apartments now stand on the site. When he died, his estate was valued at $1,115,257‚Äî most of it being in his half ownership of the Brooklyn Dodgers Baseball Club and the Ebbets Field property. His widow, Grace Slade Ebbets, and son-in-law, Joseph Gilleaudeau, were named executors. His will, however, stipulated that his shares in the Dodgers be kept intact and sold as a unit. No buyer of this large block could be found until 1945 when it was sold to Branch Rickey (then president of the Dodgers), Walter O'Malley (the Dodgers‚Äô attorney, who later became president of the club and was responsible for moving it to Los Angeles), and John L. Smith (president of Charles Pfizer & Co.). Further complications arose as the other three of Charlie's children, Charles, Jr., Maie Ebbets Cadore, and Anna Ebbets Booth, contested decisions made by the executors‚Äîpitting them in a sibling dispute against their brother-in-law, Joseph Gilleaudeau. The Great Depression in the 1930s also drained resources established for the annual payments intended for his heirs, which ceased in 1933. Settlement of the estate was tied up in the New York Surrogate's Court for nearly a quarter century. It was finally settled on December 14, 1949. His widow, his three daughters, his son's widow, and other heirs (22 in all) divided $838,558.New York Times: May 7, 1925, p. 17 (reporting on Charlie‚Äôs will), August 13, 1927, p. 23 (reporting on a delay in settling the estate), December 11, 1927, p. 30 (reporting on a contested clause of the will), December 12, 1928, p. 19, and December 13, 1928 (appraising the estate), June 11, 1933, p. 29 (requesting an accounting), August 18, 1933 (an appeal for an accounting), October 25, 1933 (rejecting the appeal), November 19, 1937 (clearing the trustees of wrongdoing), February 26, 1942 (removing the Brooklyn Trust Company as a trustee), January 23, 1944 (rejecting a petition to declare payments as annuities), August 14, 1945 (announcing the sale of stock), December 15, 1949 (declaring the estate settled). After Charlie's death, Grace eventually moved out to Long Island, living in a home at 41 Kenilworth Road, Mineola, New York.1940 U.S. census, Mineola, Nassau Co., New York, ED 234, p. 13B.

It was situated on the former narrow gauge railway line of the Southern Pacific Railroad north of Lone Pine, at an elevation of . A post office operated at Manzanar from 1911 to 1914. Manzanar was a shipping point for the surrounding apple orchards before the diversion of water through the Los Angeles Aqueduct from the Owens Valley to Los Angeles. During World War II, the area was the location of the Manzanar War Relocation Center, where people of Japanese ancestry were held.http://www.nps.gov/manz/ . accessed 6/24/2010  Owens Valley Paiute  Manzanar was first inhabited by Native Americans nearly 10,000 years ago. Approximately 1,500 years ago, the area was settled by the Owens Valley Paiute, who ranged across the Owens Valley from Long Valley on the north to Owens Lake on the south, and from the crest of the Sierra Nevada on the west to the Inyo Mountains on the east. Other Native American nations in the region included the Miwok, Western Mono, and Tubatulabal to the west, the Shoshone to the south and east, and the Mono Lake Paiute to the north. The Owens Valley Paiute hunted and fished, collected pine nuts, and raised crops utilizing irrigation in the Manzanar area. They also traded brown-ware pottery for salt from the Saline Valley, and traded other wares and goods across the Sierra Nevada during the summer and fall. The Owens Valley received scant attention from European Americans until the early 1860s, as it was little more than a crossroads on the routes through the area. When gold and silver were discovered in the Sierra Nevada and the Inyo Mountains, the resulting sudden influx of miners, farmers, cattlemen and their hungry herds brought conflict with the Owens Valley Paiute, whose crops were being destroyed. \\"The Army didn't take them on a direct route, either, said Owens Valley Paiute elder Irene Button. \\"They were forced to walk all the way around the eastern shore of Owens Lake\\" (covers an area of approximately ). Approximately one-third of the Native Americans in the Owens Valley were relocated to Fort Tejon. After 1863, many returned to their permanent villages, established along creeks flowing down from the Sierra Nevada mountains. In the Manzanar area, the Owens Valley Paiute had established villages along Bairs, Georges, Shepherds, and Symmes creeks.  Ranchers  When European American settlers first arrived in the Owens Valley in the mid-19th century, they found a number of large Paiute villages in the Manzanar area. John Shepherd, one of the first of the new settlers, homesteaded of land north of Georges Creek in 1864. With the help of Owens Valley Paiute field workers and laborers, he expanded his ranch to . As the area was developed, its farmers by 1922 produced \\"probably 90 per cent Winesaps on 400 to 500 acres of bearing trees,\\" even with its \\"limited water supply.\\" Inyo County agricultural agent J.P. Hertel predicted that year the growers would \\"no doubt plant many more trees in the future and irrigate them by the development of large wells.\\"J.P.

Quenching Los Angeles' thirst  U.S. Route 395, 2007 In 1913, the City of Los Angeles completed construction of its Los Angeles Aqueduct. It did not take long for Los Angeles water officials to realize that Owens River water was insufficient to supply the rapidly growing metropolis. In 1920, they began to purchase more of the water rights on the Owens Valley floor. As the decade went on, the City of Los Angeles bought out one Owens Valley farmer after another, and extended its reach northward into Mono County, including Long Valley. By 1933, the city owned 85 percent of all town property and 95 percent of all ranch and farm land in the Owens Valley, including Manzanar. Although some residents sold their land for prices that made them financially independent and relocated, a significant number chose to stay. In dry years, Los Angeles pumped ground water and drained all surface water, diverting all of it into its aqueduct and leaving Owens Valley ranchers without water. Without water for irrigation, the holdout ranchers left their ranches and their communities; that included the town of Manzanar, which was abandoned by 1929.

After working as a National League (NL) umpire, he was the secretary to the NL president and then became the secretary-treasurer of the NL before assuming the NL presidency himself. Heydler made early contributions to baseball recordkeeping and statistics. Biography Born in La Fargeville, New York, Heydler was a printer's apprentice as a young man, and he eventually worked at the U.S. Government Printing Office. Heydler was an umpire in the NL from 1895 to 1898, umpiring a total of 83 games. He also worked as a sportswriter. In 1903, he was hired as the private secretary to NL president Harry Pulliam, principally working to compile league playing statistics, a duty of every baseball league office. Heydler's work caused him to record much of the league's early history, and he became an advocate for new ways to measure player accomplishments; for example, he was a strong supporter of recording runs batted in for batters and he began computing earned run averages for pitchers. On becoming the NL's secretary-treasurer from 1907 to 1918, he served as the league president briefly after Pulliam's suicide in 1909. As NL president again from 1918 to 1934, he hired the Elias brothers to maintain as official keeper of playing statistics (1919), and he pushed for the selection of Kenesaw Mountain Landis as Commissioner of Baseball (1921), realizing the importance of an official who could keep the owners in check.

Somers (October 13, 1868 ‚Äì June 29, 1934) was an American executive in the coal industry in Cleveland, Ohio, who also achieved prominence in professional baseball. The financial resources from his business interests allowed Somers to become one of the principal founders of baseball's American League in 1901. In the early years of the American League, Somers owned the teams now known as the Boston Red Sox and the Cleveland Indians. Biography Somers was born in Newark, Ohio, in 1868 and moved with his family to Cleveland in 1884. He attended business school, then worked for his father's coal company. He started his own coal company, sold it, and rejoined his father's company. By age 31, Somers was worth $1 million. At the insistence of Ban Johnson, the first American League president, Somers and Jack Kilfoyl, who owned a popular Cleveland men's furnishings store, became the first owners of the franchise now known as the Cleveland Indians. Kilfoyl was Cleveland's first team president and treasurer, while Somers was its vice president and main financier. Somers was also the principal owner of the Boston Red Sox, a team which had no official nickname until 1908, but was initially sometimes called the \\"Somersets\\" in his honor. Residing in Cleveland and traveling to Boston, Somers was also the American League's vice-president during the trade war for independence of and equality with the National League which was won in 1903 with the playing of the first World Series. Somers' money helped keep some American League teams afloat in their first years, including the St. Louis Browns, Charles Comiskey's Chicago White Sox and Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics. Somers sold his interest in the Boston club in 1903 to Henry Killilea. In 1910, Kilfoyl took ill and sold his interest in Cleveland to Somers. Somers invested in one of the first baseball minor league farm systems, ultimately controlling teams in Toledo, Ohio; Ironton, Ohio; Waterbury, Connecticut; Portland, Oregon; and the New Orleans Pelicans. Facing pressure from the newly formed Federal League, in 1914 Somers transferred his Toledo Mud Hens to Cleveland to share League Park. This was done to keep the Federals out of Cleveland by ensuring there was already a ball game in Cleveland virtually every day of the season. In 1915, the American League team in Cleveland previously called the Naps, in reference to player-manager Nap Lajoie, was renamed the Indians. Although Somers had kept the Federal League at bay, the new league still had its influence, forcing salaries higher. This, combined with poor attendance at League Park, along with other investments that did not work out, put Somers in a precarious financial position. In 1916, although the Federal League had disbanded, it was too late to save Somers financially. He went broke with debts exceeding assets of $1.75 million, and at the insistence of his bank creditors, sold the Indians for $500,000 to a syndicate headed by Jim Dunn. The creditors did allow him to retain ownership of the Pelicans for sentimental reasons. The Mud Hens returned to Toledo in 1916. After selling the Indians, he successfully rebuilt his business investments. At his death in 1934, at the height of the Great Depression, his estate was worth approximately $3 million. Somers was married twice. He had a daughter, Dorothy (Mrs. W. W. Clark) from his first marriage. His second wife, Mary Alice Gilbert, survived him. Somers died in June 1934 at his summer house in Put-in-Bay, Ohio. He was interred at Lake View Cemetery.

Serving over 1000 students from grades nine to twelve, Denfeld High School has become a West Duluth landmark. The school is known for its architecture, including a historic auditorium and a 120-foot clock tower visible from Grand Avenue. History Robert E. Denfeld The home of the Hunters, Denfeld High School was known as Irving High School when it opened for classes on 11 September 1905. It was later called Duluth Industrial High School. When the school moved into today's MacArthur West school building at 725 North Central Avenue in 1915, its name was changed to honor Robert E. Denfeld, superintendent of Duluth schools from 1885 to 1916. During his tenure, the number of schools in Duluth increased from seven to 34. Denfeld was instrumental in the creation of a two-year program to train teachers which eventually grew to become the University of Minnesota Duluth. The current building was constructed in red brick and limestone at a cost of $1,250,000 and opened in September 1926. Duluth architects Abraham Holstead and W.J. Sullivan designed the H-shaped English Gothic style building which features medieval carvings by Duluth master stone carver George Thrana. Thrana came to Duluth in 1889 from Norway where he was trained as a stone sculptor. He carved for 40 years in sandstone, granite, marble and limestone and his work is featured on many Duluth buildings including the Lyceum Theater, Old Central High School, Glensheen, the Board of Trade Building, St. Louis County Courthouse and the St. Louis County Jail. Perhaps the most iconic feature of the Denfeld High School building is its 120-foot clock tower. The tower features eight buttresses. Its face was designed by Carl Shroer, a teacher at Central High School, and was completed by Denfeld students who welded together four sections cast in aluminum by the Duluth Brassworks Company. The numbers on the face were painted silver and the clock hands were gold painted wood. The face was later painted black to be easier read from Grand Avenue. Denfeld High School's auditorium was built at a cost of $25,000 and is another of its most prominent features. It can accommodate nearly 2000 people in the audience, 200 on stage and includes an orchestra pit. Public figures who've visited in the auditorium include Richard Nixon and Johnny Cash. The auditorium was renovated for $1,200,000 and reopened in late 2006 after being closed for nearly a year. The auditorium is the annual venue for Denfeld's traditional Maroon and Gold Day assembly during the week of homecoming when the auditorium is adorned with maroon and gold decorations and the students are entertained with cheers, skits, music and school spirit. Alumni return to Denfeld for this display which is meant to motivate football players and fans for the homecoming game. Homecoming Week First floor hallway Homecoming Week activities include daily dress-up days such as \\"Kid Day\\" (usually on Tuesday) and \\"Maroon and Gold Day\\" (every Friday for the last 100 years.) On Wednesday of Homecoming Week, a massive bonfire takes place in Merritt Park in West Duluth during which the game of Red Rover is usually played between the upper and lowerclassmen and every cheer in the cheerleaders' book is started. The biggest event during the week besides the football game and assembly is the hall decorating contest, where the interior first floor of the building is covered in handmade posters, streamers, locker signs, balloons and other decorations. Freshmen decorate the hall near the cafeteria and sophomores decorate the other half of the hall, while juniors decorate the second floor. Until the fall of 2006, seniors traditionally decorated the auditorium, however after a renovation of the room in the 2006-2007 school year, seniors have since decorated the third floor hallway to ensure the auditorium's features remain preserved. =Maroon and Gold Day= Auditorium decorations Denfeld's Maroon and Gold Day is Friday of homecoming week. Students wear maroon and/or gold clothing and accessories. During the assembly, the band marches from the back of the auditorium through streamers and balloons to the orchestra pit playing the cadence and school song. Everyone stands throughout the entire assembly. After the school song is played, the National Anthem is sung followed by several skits, speeches by alumni and the Maroon and Gold Day Pageant. In this pageant, anybody can enter for a chance to become Maroon & Gold King or Queen. Each contestant is allowed to flaunt their costume and spirit to the audience. Winners are chosen by three judges, all Denfeld staff, based on audience reaction. After the pageant are more skits and the winner of the hall decorating contest is announced. The football team starting lineup is announced and the school song is played again at the end of the assembly. =The homecoming game= The Denfeld Marching Band and the Dance Team always perform during the halftime show. The Milken Educator Award On October 11, 2007 Denfeld social studies teacher Thomas Tusken was presented with the Milken Educator Awards, established by Milken Family Foundation Chairman Lowell Milken to provide public recognition and individual financial rewards of $25,000 to elementary and secondary teachers, principals and specialists who are furthering excellence in education. Only 35 educators in Minnesota had received the award at that time and Tusken was just the second recipient from Duluth. The award was presented to Tusken during an unexpected assembly, the purpose of which was unknown to students and staff. When Tusken's name was called, he received a standing ovation from the audience. Future of the school Additions under construction in July 2011 In the spring of 2007, restructuring of Duluth's elementary, middle and high schools was discussed. Three options were proposed: * The Red Plan: Central and East would no longer function as high schools, leaving Denfeld as the only original high school in Duluth. Ordean Middle School would be turned into a high school with both buildings being remodeled and expanded to accommodate 1500 students. * The White Plan: Denfeld and East would become middle schools capable of holding 1100 students. Central would not be used, as Ordean and a new western high school would be created to accommodate 3000 total students. * The Blue Plan: East and Denfeld would be transformed into middle schools. Central would be used as the lone high school after being expanded to accommodate 3000 students. The Duluth School District ultimately chose a modified version of the Red Plan, leaving Denfeld open and adding approximately half of the Central population. To accommodate the increased student population, two new additions to the school were built. Additionally, the school underwent major reconstruction in order to conform to state standards. Construction began in 2009 and continued until 2011. To accommodate the new addition, Denfeld's signature brick chimney had to be removed. The chimney was an original feature of the building, but had not been used in many years. Construction crews cafefully removed the bricks, and the school planned to preserve some bricks for historical purposes. As a result of the construction, Denfeld and Central students both attended Central during the 2010-11 school year. In 2011, Central closed, leaving Denfeld and East as the only public high schools in Duluth. Principals *Tom Tusken (2020 to present) *Tonya M.

(1911). \\"Precaria\\". In The Catholic Encyclopedia. New York: Robert Appleton Company. Retrieved August 6, 2013 via New Advent. The precarium is thus a free gift made on request (or precarius, whence \\"prayer\\") and can be revoked. The grantor can reclaim the land and evict the grantee at any time, and the grantee's hold on the land is said to be \\"precarious\\". (The adjectival form \\"precarial\\" is also used.) The precarium arose in the late Roman Empire. In the Middle Ages it became a legal fiction, and the two parties usually signed a contract specifying the rent or services owed by the petitioner. Some precaria eventually became hereditary fiefs. In the Merovingian period the feminine form (singular precaria) became common, but in the eighth century the term beneficium began to replace precarium, although the institutions were practically identical.John Beeler, Warfare in Feudal Europe, 730‚Äì1200 (Cornell University Press, 1971), 3‚Äì6, contains a good discussion of precaria. Ecclesiastical use Precarium is discussed in the legal digests of Justinian, and seems to have existed in 6th century Visigothic Spain and France.Wendy Davies and Paul Fouracre (2003). Property and Power in the Early Middle Ages. Cambridge University Press. p. 45 In feudalism, the use of church lands to support warriors contributed to the growth of precaria in the eighth century in Catholic Europe. Modern historians have sometimes called these lands fiefs; however, to the extent that they were church property and not property of the lord or king--although that was a flexible distinction in the ninth and tenth centuries--they were not fiefs. The distinction was between the right of ownership in the ecclesiastical manner (jure proprio et more ecclesiastico), which remained with the church, and the right of benefit and usufruct (jure beneficiario et usufructuario), which was ceded away.Giles Constable, \\"Nona et Decima: An Aspect of Carolingian Economy\\", Speculum, 35:2 (1960), pp. 224‚Äì250. The lord or king often paid a fixed rent annually to the church or monastery for the land. This was usually expressed as a proportion of the revenue generated by the property, typically a \\"ninth and tenth\\" (nona et decima), that is, a tenth of the original produce and then a ninth of what remained‚Äîthe equivalent of a fifth of the original total. The vassal or knight using the land did not hold it outright, but during the lord's pleasure he enjoyed all the profits and advantages of the land and its buildings, normally intended to supply the wherewithal required to maintain him and his retinue. If the church did not have enough funds to stay out of poverty the entire land under precaria could be restored to the church. Precaria not only refers to the contract, but also the land under the contract, the benefice (although the term benefice is also used to describe similar but non-religious circumstances).

The newspaper traces its history to the Southern Banner newspaper that first published on March 20, 1832. In 1921, the newspaper merged with the Athens Herald to become the Athens Banner-Herald. Earl Braswell served as the newspaper's publisher, a position he held until 1965. That same year, Billy and Charles Morris of Morris Communications purchased the newspaper. On June 17, 1965, the weekly Athens Advertiser changed its name to the Athens Daily News and became a seven-day morning paper, competing with the afternoon Athens Banner-Herald. Glenn Vaughn wrote in the Athens Daily News' first editorial page: \\"Our goal is to produce a daily newspaper that will be equal to this magnificent community.\\" Lewis Grizzard served as one of the newspaper's first sports writers. On December 24, 1967, the Morris family, which owned the Athens Banner-Herald, bought the Athens Daily News. The Morris family continued publishing both papers, though eventually both editorial staffs merged. In 1991, the News and Banner-Herald moved into a new office located at the corner of Thomas and Broad streets. The building is known as The News Building. In 1996, the newspapers started a Web page, Athenaeum. The following year, the newspaper started OnlineAthens.com, its current Web page. In 2001, the News and Banner-Herald merged into a single morning paper under the Banner-Herald name. The newspaper routinely wins awards in Georgia Press Association and Georgia Associated Press competitions, including Story of the Year honors in 2002, 2004, and 2006.

A. Robert Quinn, was an American executive in Major League Baseball who became renowned for his management of four different franchises. Career Born in Columbus, Ohio, Quinn was a catcher in minor league baseball during the 1890s, also managing some of the teams for which he played. From 1902 to 1917, he served as general manager of the Columbus Senators in the American Association; he was also among the founders of that league. In 1908, he founded and was president of the Ohio State League, a Class D minor league which began operation as a six team league with teams located in Central/Southern Ohio. He became general manager of the St. Louis Browns from 1917 to 1922, developing the perennially poor team into one which lost the 1922 American League pennant by a single game. In 1923, Quinn led a group that purchased the Boston Red Sox, and as team president he worked to restore the credibility of a franchise whose best players had been sold off by previous owner Harry Frazee. The group included businessman and former president of the Columbus Senators, Edward Schoenborn and Columbus physician Robert B. Drury, who had put himself through medical school playing and managing in the minor leagues in the early 1900s. However, the most important member of Quinn's ownership group, St. Louis millionaire Palmer Winslow, died in 1927. For the remainder of Quinn's tenure as owner of the Red Sox, the team was severely under financed. Largely as a result, Quinn's tenure as owner was, statistically speaking, the darkest in franchise history. In 10 years, the Red Sox never finished higher than sixth, and were no closer than 25 games out of first. They finally bottomed out in 1932, with a record that is still the worst in franchise history. Just before 1933 spring training began, Quinn sold the Red Sox to Tom Yawkey. Quinn then became general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers for two seasons (1934‚Äì1935). He then joined the Boston Braves as team president and part owner from 1936 to 1945. After his 1945 retirement, he briefly served as a sporting goods executive, and then became president of the Baseball Hall of Fame from 1948 to 1951, leaving that position after suffering two strokes. Patriarch of baseball family Quinn died at age 84 in Providence, Rhode Island, and was buried near Columbus. His son John J. Quinn served as general manager of the Braves following his father's retirement, continuing after the team moved to Milwaukee in 1953, and later served as GM of the Philadelphia Phillies. His grandson Bob Quinn served as general manager of the New York Yankees, Cincinnati Reds, and San Francisco Giants between 1988 and 1996, and his grandson Jack Quinn served as general manager of the St. Louis Blues franchise in the National Hockey League. His great-grandson Bob Quinn (born 1968) is the former executive vice president, finance and administration, and chief financial officer of the Milwaukee Brewers.

He was the general manager of Major League Baseball's Atlanta Braves from 1990 to 2007, and then served as the Braves President for a decade from 2007 until 2016. Before joining Atlanta, he spent 22 years with the Kansas City Royals organization, including nine (1982‚Äì1990) as the club's general manager. Among the teams he built are the 1985 Royals and 1995 Braves, both World Series champions. His teams have also won their division 16 times, including 14 consecutive times in Atlanta. During his time with the Braves, they won three National League pennants and played in five National League Championship series. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2017. Personal life Schuerholz was born in [Baltimore], the son of John Schuerholz Sr., who played in the Philadelphia Athletics minor league system from 1937 to 1940. He is a graduate of the Baltimore City College High School, Towson University and Loyola University. While at Towson, Schuerholz applied for officer candidate school and was rejected, as he was partially deaf. Before his career in baseball, Schuerholz was a teacher at North Point Junior High in Baltimore. Upon leaving his teaching job, he was drafted by the United States Army to serve in the Vietnam War. After entering Major League Baseball with the Baltimore Orioles, Schuerholz joined the United States Army Reserve. He donated $250,000 to Towson in 1999. This money was used to upgrade the school's baseball facility, which was named after Schuerholz. Schuerholz's son, Jonathan, was selected by Atlanta in the eighth round of the 2002 MLB draft and played in the minor leagues until 2007. Jonathan retired from baseball in August 2007 to go back to Auburn University to complete his business degree. The younger Schuerholz, who finished his six-year career in the minor leagues with a .223 batting average, was named manager of the Rome Braves (Atlanta's Class-A minor league affiliate) in 2014. After the season, Jonathan was reassigned to the Braves front office to serve as an assistant player-development director. Career The Baltimore Orioles hired Schuerholz in 1966 as a result of a letter Schuerholz wrote to team owner Jerold Hoffberger. Schuerholz worked under Frank Cashen, Harry Dalton, and Lou Gorman. In 1969, Major League Baseball expanded to Kansas City. Gorman and Schuerholz left for the Royals. Schuerholz was named general manager of the Royals during the 1981 offseason, and became Major League Baseball's youngest general manager at the time. Schuerholz built a strong relationship with Royals owner Ewing Kauffman, but left the team as it began to struggle. He joined the Braves in 1990, succeeding Bobby Cox who returned to the dugout to manage the team. The duo of Schuerholz and Cox produced an unprecedented run of success for the franchise, highlighted by the 1995 World Series Championship. On October 11, 2007, Schuerholz resigned as the Atlanta Braves general manager, but was promoted to club president, replacing Terry McGuirk. Schuerholz's top assistant Frank Wren was named the general manager. When Schuerholz stepped down as club president in March 2016, his duties were split between Derek Schiller, as president of business, and Mike Plant, as president of development. Schuerholz has sent many assistants to general manager positions around the league, including Wren and Braves former GM John Coppolella. Dayton Moore, the Braves' former Director of Scouting and assistant GM under Schuerholz, has been GM of the Kansas City Royals since 2006, when he replaced Allard Baird.http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/al/royals/2006-05-31-baird- fired_x.htm In 2006, Schuerholz published a book, Built To Win, which chronicled his tenure with the Braves and some of his most important moves as a GM. Included in his book is a trade the Braves almost made with the Pirates in 1992. Had the deal gone through the Braves would have sent pitcher Alejandro Pena and outfielder Keith Mitchell to the Pirates in exchange for Barry Bonds.https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/11/sports/baseball/before-balco- bonds-was-almost-a-brave.html?_r=0 On December 4, 2016, Schuerholz was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. He was formally inducted on July 30, 2017. Awards and honors In 2019, Schuerholz was named a Georgia Trustee by the Georgia Historical Society, in conjunction with the Office of the Governor of Georgia, to recognize accomplishments and community service that reflect the ideals of the founding body of Trustees, which governed the Georgia colony from 1732 to 1752.

The company was founded by Ayman Kandeel, (hence the initials); D√¶rick Gr√∂ss, Sr. is the editor-in-chief; Waleed Al-Telbany is the art director; Mohie El-Dein Sideiq is the Arabic-language editor and Sara Kareem is the English-language editor. AK Comics first began publishing monthly titles in 2004, and its comics are produced in both Arabic and English. The comics are collectively titled Middle East Heroes.\\"Middle East gets first superheroes.\\" BBC. Monday 7 March 2005. Retrieved 10 August 2014. Overview As explained in the first inside page of various issues, the intention of AK Comics is \\"to fill the cultural gap created over the years by providing essentially Arab role models, in our case, Arab superheroes, to become a source of pride to our young generations.\\" Superheroes There are four superheroes: * Zein, a philosophy professor and the last of an ancient line of pharaohs. He lives in Origin City, which resembles Cairo, and uses ancient technology and superpowers to thwart evil- doers. * Aya, a law student driven to fighting crime when her mother is wrongly accused of murdering her father. She has no superpowers of her own, but fights for justice and gender equality. * Jalila, a female scientist who at the age of 16 survived an explosion at the Dimodona nuclear plant (a reference to the Dimona nuclear plant used by Israel to build its undeclared nuclear arsenal), and gained super-powers from the radiation. She protects the City of All Faiths (based on Jerusalem) from the warring Zios Army and the United Liberation Force. * Rakan, a medieval warrior who survived a Mongol invasion of Mesopotamia and was raised by a saber-toothed cat. His country is constantly attacked by Mongols, Turks and Crusaders. Through the techniques of \\"sheba\\" (wisdom and peace) he is an invincible warrior. Rakan's most known enemy to date is ChessMaster, co-created by Rafael Albuquerque. Apart from Rakan, who inhabits a sort of sword and sorcery world, all the superheroes live in the near future, in the immediate aftermath of the \\"55-Year War\\" between unnamed superpowers, when terrorists and criminals constantly threaten to destroy the fragile peace. Although the protagonists are clearly Middle Eastern, for the sake of neutrality there is no direct reference to the religion or ethnicity of the characters. As explained in one issue: \\"The religious backgrounds of the heroes remain undisclosed so that no religion or faith can be perceived as better than another.\\" Daniel Williams (2005) \\"Arab Superheroes Leap Pyramids in a Single Bound\\" The Washington Post Wednesday, February 16, 2005; Page C01 Reception AK Comics started an initial United States venture in 2004 and found the market crowded.Pilcher, Tim and Brad Brooks. (Foreword: Dave Gibbons). The Essential Guide to World Comics. Collins and Brown. 2005. 306-307. AK Comics sells mainly in Egypt and is beginning to be distributed in other Middle Eastern states, as well as having overseas subscriptions (particularly in the United States). As of September 2005 the comics sell 15,000 copies an issue, and are beginning to break even. Censorship and a lack of local artists are issues for the company; besides had the initial storylines started by 'Studio G Pub' studio, most of the artwork is produced in Brazil by 'PopArt Comics Studio','Daniel Brand√£o Studio' and 'Legio Studio'. Among some subtle differences on displaying the characters in the middle-east ambient are the sensitive reduction of female features, like the size of breasts and skimpy outfits used by them. Nashar said that in certain cases local censors went through each page blackening out breasts with markers, and only the titles featuring the male characters are currently distributed in Saudi Arabia.Ed O'Loughlin, (2005) \\"Hero Jalila a comic cut above the rest\\" The Age, Saturday September 24, 2005, p.18 The comics were received very favorably in the United States, where sales averaged 4,500 copies per issue for the first four issues released.

He was lord of Ramla from 1150‚Äì1152. BiographyEarly years= He was the son of Hodierna of Rethel and H√©ribrand II of Hierges; Hodierna was daughter of Hugh I of Rethel and sister of King Baldwin II of Jerusalem. He arrived in Jerusalem around 1140 and was appointed constable of Jerusalem, the highest office of the kingdom, by his cousin Queen Melisende, after the death of Melisende's husband King Fulk in 1143. As constable he was in command of the army, and was sent to relieve the siege of Edessa in 1144. He did not arrive in time and the city fell to Zengi. =Jerusalem= In response to the fall of Edessa, the Second Crusade arrived in Jerusalem in 1148. Manasses was present at the Council of Acre that year, in which it was decided to attack Damascus, but the siege of Damascus was a failure and the crusade dispersed. Probably around 1150, he married Helvis of Ramla, widow of Barisan of Ibelin, thus establishing himself in the east not only with the favour of his royal relatives, but also with much land and money; in right of Helvis he ruled Ramlah and Mirabel, and virtually the entire southern part of Palestine, except the Lordship of Ibelin, which passed to Helvis and Barisan's son Hugh of Ibelin. According to William of Tyre, Manasses \\"is said to have conducted himself very haughtily. He assumed an insolent attitude of superiority towards the elders of the realm and refused to show them proper respect.\\" With his newfound power, he made many enemies among the more established older nobles, and Melisende's son Baldwin III especially hated him for keeping him out of government and alienating him from his mother. Manasses supported Melisende against Baldwin III when Baldwin attempted to claim full power in 1152. Baldwin had himself crowned separately and the kingdom was divided between him and Melisende, with Melisende keeping Jerusalem and Nablus in the south and Baldwin ruling from Acre and Tyre in the north. Baldwin appointed a constable of his own, Humphrey II of Toron, and soon invaded the south. He forced Manasses to surrender his castle of Mirabel, and captured Jerusalem from Melisende. Manasses was exiled and permanently replaced as constable by Humphrey. =Personal life= The dates of his birth and death are unknown, as indeed are the details of his life outside the period spent in Jerusalem. With Helvis he had two daughters, one of whom may have been born after his exile in 1152. ReferencesSources *William of Tyre, A History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea, trans. E.A. Babcock and A.C.

Oral tradition identifies the instrument with the kinnor of Ancient Israel, played by David to soothe King Saul's nerves and heal him of insomnia, and later brought to Africa by Menelik I. Its actual origin remains in doubt, though local manuscripts depict the instrument at the beginning of the 15th century.(Kimberlin 1978: 13) Instrument The begena's standard finger positioning. Known as the instrument of noblemen, monks and the upper class and performed by both men and women, the begena was used primarily as an accompaniment during meditation and prayer. It is played in the framework of religious occasions. During Lent, the instrument is often heard on the radio and around churches. Begena is accompanied by singing voice only. The singer may compose his or her own texts or they may be taken from the Bible, from the Book of Proverbs, or from the Book of Qine, an anthology of proverbs and love poems. Subject matter includes the futility of life, the inevitability of death, saints, mores, morality, prayer, and praises to God. The song's duration varies according to the text, the audience, and the persistence of the player. Though many texts are of a religious nature, the instrument is not used in the Ethiopian Orthodox church services, even if it is seen occasionally in religious processions outside the church. Because of the instrument's relatively intimate and sacred role in society, the begena is not easy to find. Meditation and prayer are very private, personal endeavors, and hearsay suggests that the instrument is played by very few and is a dying art. However, in 1972, the Yared Music School in Addis Ababa began formal instruction in the begena. Since 2004, evening courses are organized and the begena is still played. A begena stylist in the common playing position. The begena has ten strings. However, different musicians use varying numbers of strings to play the begena. For example, begena teacher Memhr Sisay Demissae uses all ten strings to play the begena, while other players may use five or six of the strings. The left hand is used to pluck the strings. When all ten strings are plucked, one method of tuning the begena is to tune each pair of strings to one of the pitches in a pentatonic scale. When using five of the stings, only the first, fourth, sixth, eighth and tenth strings are tuned and plucked to give sound. Finally, while playing the begena using six strings, the left hand plucks strings one, three, four, six, eight, and ten (starting from the left side when facing the instrument). The pointing finger plucks strings three and four while the other fingers are in charge of controlling one string each. The remaining strings are used for the finger rests or stops after the strings have been plucked, allowing the plucked string to vibrate. The begena may also be played using a system called , wherein a plectrum made of horn or wood is used to pluck the ten strings of the begena. Megabe Sebhat Alemu Aga plays begena both by using his fingertips and . The begena is characterized by a very specific buzzing sound, due to U-shaped leather pieces placed between each string and the bridge. The thong for each string is adjusted up or down along the bridge so that the string, when plucked, repeatedly vibrates against the edge of the bridge.

Generally tips are offered per piece of luggage or item; in the United States, tips of $3-5 US per item are common, with higher tips being offered for extra services such as checking overweight or excess bags or getting passengers in front of long lines. Skycaps are found at major or international airports in Canada, where the average charge is $10 for 3 or fewer pieces of baggage and $2 per additional item. The skycap is the descendant of the redcap, a railway porter. Redcaps were named for their distinctive red hats, which helped them stand out from a crowd so that railway passengers could easily identify them. When commercial airlines became viable, many airlines provided skycap service because people were accustomed to getting assistance from railway porters, and the term ‚Äúskycap‚Äù was coined to describe porters who worked in airports. Skycaps often wait near the curb or in the baggage claim area, so that they can meet passengers as they arrive with luggage. Most skycaps have access to luggage carts for moving luggage around, and they may also assist with wheelchairs, strollers, and oversized items. Most skycaps also perform curbside check-ins for flights, allowing passengers to skip the lines at the airline's counter, help unload luggage from cars and taxis, and they also answer questions from passengers and family members.

The episode serves as the \\"WB Finale\\" of the series, as it moved to the UPN channel for the remainder of the series. The premise of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is that an adolescent girl, Buffy Summers, is chosen by mystical forces and given superhuman powers to kill vampires, demons, and other evil creatures in the fictional town of Sunnydale. She is supported by a close circle of family and friends, nicknamed the Scooby Gang. In \\"The Gift\\", Buffy refuses to accept that her sister Dawn's death is the only way to defeat the hell-god Glory and prepares to do battle. In the end, she discovers the meaning of her \\"gift\\". Plot The Scooby Gang considers plans to foil Glory, but can only suggest killing Buffy's sister Dawn before Glory uses her in the ritual, which Buffy refuses to consider. Anya suggests using the Dagon Sphere, which repels and confuses Glory, and the hammer of Olaf the troll. They hope to delay Glory until her deadline for completing the ritual has passed, preventing an apocalypse and making Dawn useless to her. As Buffy trains with Giles, she reveals to him that the First Slayer told her, on her vision quest (in \\"Intervention\\"), that death was her gift, an idea she rejects. Buffy also notes that while she survived killing Angel despite loving him, losing Dawn will destroy her. Xander proposes to Anya. Buffy and Spike gather weapons. She asks him to protect Dawn. Spike tells Buffy he knows she'll never love him, but is grateful that she treats him like a man rather than a monster. Glory's minions build a tower for the ritual to open the gates between dimensions. Buffy and her allies confront Glory just as the ritual is to begin. Willow launches a magic attack, confusing and dazing Glory, while restoring Tara's sanity. Buffy attacks Glory with the Dagon sphere, but Glory manages to destroy it. As they fight Glory punches off her head, revealing she is actually fighting Buffy's robot double. Buffy surprises Glory by attacking her with Olaf's hammer, and then races to save Dawn, but Glory slows her down as they battle on the tower. The two of them fall to the ground below and Xander uses a crane to hit Glory with a wrecking ball. Buffy beats Glory with the hammer until she reverts to Ben, but spares his life, telling him that Glory must never return or they will both die. With the others' attention diverted, Giles kills Ben by suffocating him, to prevent Glory's re-emergence. With the window of time to stop the ritual about to close, the Scoobies spot someone up on the scaffolding with Dawn. Willow telepathically tells Spike to go up to Dawn, and she and Tara magically clear a path for him by throwing aside Glory's minions and guards. Spike finds the demon Doc threatening to start the ritual. A fight ensues, but Doc tosses Spike off the scaffolding and then cuts into Dawn with shallow cuts, starting the apocalyptic ritual. Buffy reaches the top, pushes Doc off and frees the captive Dawn just as the portal between dimensions opens. Dawn is willing to sacrifice herself to seal the portal, but Buffy, realizing the true meaning of the First Slayer's revelation, stops her. Buffy throws herself into the portal, which closes when she dies. She is buried with the epitaph, \\"She saved the world. A lot.\\" Themes In an essay on the ownership of evil, Erma Petrova argues that Giles murdering Ben is comparable to Willow murdering Warren (in \\"Villains\\")- both victims are human, and their deaths are necessary to prevent further suffering. Although the moral ambiguity of killing Ben is discussed earlier in the episode, as well as Ben's innocence (\\"I know he's an innocent, but...not like 'Dawn' innocent\\"), Giles is never shown to have feelings of guilt afterwards; he did what needed to be done. Contrast this with Willow's guilt over murdering Warren in a spirit of revenge, a theme that persists until the end of the series. Petrova feels the difference for Giles is that killing Ben is his only option - the police wouldn't understand the danger, Buffy is morally unable to take a human life, and leaving him alive presents too great a risk. Willow, however, had other options available and yet chose to murder Warren anyway. Giles recognizes that Buffy, as a hero, lives by a more demanding moral code than most people. Her unique role and abilities confer special responsibilities, including moral rules by which Giles is not bound. When Ben marvels, \\"She could have killed me\\", Giles disagrees: \\"No she couldn‚Äôt. Never... She‚Äôs a hero, you see. She‚Äôs not like us.\\" However, in an essay on the ethics in this episode, C. W. Marshall claims that Giles actually exhibits heroism, as his murder of Ben serves a greater good and protects those he loves. Cultural References *In response to Buffy's declaration that she'll kill anyone who tries to hurt Dawn, Spike says, \\"Well, not exactly the Saint Crispin's Day speech, was it?\\" To which Giles replies, \\"We few, we happy few--\\" and Spike finishes, \\"we band of buggered.\\" The original line is, \\"We few, we happy few, we band of brothers.\\" Continuity *Xander exclaims that smart chicks are hot and Willow asks, \\"You couldn't have figured that out in the tenth grade?\\" This is a reference to the crush Willow had on Xander during Seasons 1 and 2. Her feelings are unrequited until Season 3. *On her way out of the magic shop, Tara points to Giles and says, \\"you're a killer\\" foreshadowing that Giles will kill Ben. *Olaf is referred to as a \\"troll-god\\" here, despite being classified as a human transformed by a vengeance demon in his other mentions. This change allows his hammer to be used as a weapon against Glory. =Arc Significance= * Buffy dies a second time; the first was in \\"Prophecy Girl\\". She will joke about this in \\"Once More, with Feeling\\". * Despite her death at the hands of The Master at the end of Season 1 bringing forth a new slayer, Kendra, there is never any mention of a new slayer being created following Buffy's death here. * Spike is invited back into Buffy's home after being banned in \\"Crush\\". He will not be disinvited again, even after his attack on Buffy in season six. * Spike also says to Buffy while they are getting weapons, \\"I always knew I would go down fighting\\" which foreshadows his death to save the world in season seven. * Spike's statement to Buffy on the staircase that she will never love him mirrors his last words to her in \\"Chosen\\". * Crossover with Angel: in \\"I Will Remember You\\", the Oracles told Angel that Buffy would die. Additionally, in an instance of foreshadowing in the episode \\"Who Are You\\", if you look closer at Joyce's credit card, it expires in May 2001‚Äìthe month Buffy dies in \\"The Gift\\" (aired May 22, 2001). Faith (in Buffy's body) also words this expiration date while buying a plane ticket on the phone. * Crossover with Angel: In the final scene of \\"There's No Place Like Plrtz Glrb\\", Willow goes to Los Angeles to tell Angel and his crew that Buffy is dead. * The Key ceases to be significant; as Dawn says in the next episode, \\"I'm not the Key. Or if I am, I don't open anything anymore.\\" In \\"Storyteller\\", Andrew Wells says, \\"Dawn used to be a key. I don't really know what that means.\\" * Glory is defeated and dies, ending her reign as the \\"Big Bad\\" of season five. Her death allows the First Evil to take her form, as seen in the seventh season premiere episode \\"Lessons.\\" * Giles commits murder for the first time when he kills Glory while she is in the form of Ben, suffocating him. Giles has never directly taken a human life (with the exception of accidentally causing the death of a friend when he and a group of Wiccans summoned the demon Eyghon, which is revealed in Season Two). Before he kills him, Giles explains to Ben that Buffy could never bring herself to kill a human, a statement which directly contradicts the events in \\"Spiral\\", when Buffy kills several Knights of Byzantium, who are human, albeit in defense of herself and the gang. He most likely meant Buffy could never commit a murder since the knights she killed were in self-defense.

It was located at in the city of Butare and was established in 1963 by the government in cooperation with the Congregation of the Dominicans from the Province of Quebec, Canada. Its founder and first rector was Father Georges- Henri L√©vesque. In 2013, along with all public higher education institutions in Rwanda, it was merged into the newly created University of Rwanda. When it was established, the NUR had three divisions (Faculties of Medicine and Social Sciences, and a Teacher Training College), 51 students and 16 lecturers. The university suffered badly during the genocide and had to close in 1994, reopening in April 1995. At that time English was introduced as a medium of instruction alongside French. As of 2005 it focused on Science and Technology and Humanities, with French and English as the medium of instruction. History When it started in 1963 NUR was composed of three academic units: the Faculty of Medicine, the Faculty of Social Sciences and the Teacher Training College (ENS). At that time, it had 51 students and 16 lecturers. By 2005, the university had 8221 students and 425 lecturers. Important dates and facts are: *November 3, 1963: Official opening of NUR *May 12, 1964: Law establishing the NUR *1966: The National Institute of Education was created thanks to the UNDP and UNESCO: The Institute aimed at training and improving elementary secondary school teachers‚Äô skills. It also aimed at implementing multidisciplinary pedagogical research. *1967: Creation of the University Extension as a unit with the mission to reflect NUR by its services to the people *1972: Creation of a research centre on pharmacopoeia and traditional medicine (CUPHARMETRA) in the Faculty of medicine. This became an autonomous body in 1980. *May 1973: NUR, in conjunction with the Ghent Faculty of Applied Sciences put up a progressive training program for civil engineers specialized in building and set up a fore-project program in electro mechanic engineering. *October 1973: The University of Instelling Antwerpen contributed in the opening of the Faculty of Law. *1974: A centre for study and experimentation of energy in Rwanda was created within the Faculty of Sciences. It became autonomous since 1977. *June 13, 1979: The Faculty of Agronomy, which was a department in the Faculty of Science, was created. *October 1, 1981: NUR and the NIE (National Institute of Education) were merged. Since then, the National University of Rwanda had two campuses: one at Ruhengeri and another at Butare. A few years later, the Faculty of Law shifted to Mburabuturo (Kigali). *November 1988: Celebration of the 25th anniversary of NUR. Official opening of the Institute of Public Administration (ISAP), born of NUR and Konrad Adanauer Foundation (FKA) cooperation *April‚ÄìJuly 1994: The University community lost a good number of its staff and students who were killed during the war and genocide. They were victims of their ideology or ethnic identity. The University suffered a great loss: laboratory equipment, the computer equipment and academic infrastructure were destroyed or taken away. NUR was closed because of the prevailing war in the country, those who were not killed had to hide themselves, and others fled in exile. *January 1995: The campus of Ruhengeri and the Kigali Faculty of Law shifted and become part of the campus of Butare. *April 1995: Reopening of NUR. The main change was that all the faculties and schools were regrouped in Butare Campus for security reasons first and then for administrative reasons. The beginning was not easy but the government decided upon the smooth running of NUR at all costs. A Campus that was built for 1,600 students now had to lodge more than 4,500. NUR took off slowly but surely despite the wounds of war. English became a new language of teaching. *April 2, 1996: Creation of the School of Information Sciences and Techniques (ESTI) *1997: A preliminary year of language learning (French and English) is established for all UNR beginners. *1998: Creation of a doctorate level at the Faculty of Medicine *June 15, 1998: Creation of the Research Commission *End of 1998: The merging of the Faculty of Sciences and that of Applied Sciences to form the Faculty of Sciences and Technology. *1999: Creation of the Centre for Conflict Management *November 27, 1999: The University League against Aids (LUCS) was created *December 1999: Creation of the University Centre for Arts.

Soden (April 23, 1843 ‚Äì August 13, 1925) was an American executive in Major League Baseball who was the president/owner of the Boston Base Ball Club of the National League during the 1887‚Äì1906 seasons, president of the National League in 1882, and a Civil War veteran. Early life Soden was born on April 23, 1843, in Framingham, Massachusetts. Soden served as a hospital steward with the 22nd Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry during the Civil War. After the war, Soden was an amateur baseball player of note. In 1874, he was part of the Boston club during their tour of England. He played center field in a game at the Kennington Oval. Baseball In 1876, Soden bought into the Boston Base Ball Club. He and J. B. Billings later purchased controlling interest in the club and Soden became the team's president in 1877. Soden is credited with inventing the baseball reserve clause‚Äîin 1880, standard player contracts began including a clause stating that the club could reserve the player for the following season; teams could reserve up to five players. In 1883, the number was increased to 11, which was a typical roster size in that era, and soon teams were allowed unlimited reserves. In 1882, Soden served briefly as president of the National League (NL) following the death of William Hulbert. When the rival American Association was preparing to expand to eight teams for the 1883 season, Soden acted to add NL teams in New York City and Philadelphia (both cities had been kicked out of the league by Hulbert after the inaugural 1876 season), replacing the Troy Trojans and Worcester Ruby Legs, the bottom two teams in the league. Although Troy and Worcester objected to their removal, their attendance problems‚Äîdrawing only 6 and 18 spectators in their final two games against one another‚Äîsealed their fate. Soden played a major role in the war between the NL and the Players' League in 1890, bankrolling several teams in the league as attendance dropped; by the time the NL emerged triumphant, Soden owned a majority of the New York Giants in addition to his control of the Boston franchise. Boston won five pennants between 1891 and 1898. After losing the pennant to Baltimore in 1894 and 1895, a struggling start in 1896 led Soden to observe that his players' on-field arguments were having a negative effect, and stated that any players fined for abusing umpires would now pay their own fines rather than have the team cover the cost secretly; Boston went on a 22‚Äì2 run over the next few weeks, and briefly took over first place, but finished behind Baltimore (for the last time) that season. Soden was known for being stingy, and catcher Boileryard Clarke observed after coming to the Beaneaters from Baltimore in 1899 that the team owner was also amazingly distant. Clarke later insisted that although he played for Boston for two years, Soden never knew he was on the team. After the American League emerged as a rival in the 20th century, many players began deserting the NL for the new league, and Boston suffered the heaviest casualties. Personal life Outside of baseball, Soden ran a successful roofing business with his son, Charles. He resided in West Newton, Massachusetts. Soden died at his summer home in Sunapee, New Hampshire, on August 13, 1925. NotesSources * Nemec, David (1997), The Great Encyclopedia of 19th-Century Major League Baseball, Penguin. * John L.

He played for the New York Islanders and Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League (NHL). Playing career Originally drafted in the sixth round, 150th overall, of the 1998 NHL Entry Draft by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, Hunter was traded to the New York Islanders in exchange for a fourth- round draft pick in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft. He set franchise records for the Bridgeport Sound Tigers of the American Hockey League (AHL) in all three scoring categories (30 goals, 35 assists and 65 points). He made his NHL debut in the 2002 Stanley Cup playoffs, scoring one goal and one assist in four games. Hunter broke into the NHL full-time with the Islanders in 2003‚Äì04 and was tied for first on the team in goals (25, with Mariusz Czerkawski) and tied for total points (51, with Oleg Kvasha). He finished third in voting for the Calder Memorial Trophy in 2004, losing to goaltender Andrew Raycroft of the Boston Bruins. During the 2004‚Äì05 NHL lockout, Hunter played in Nyk√∂pings Hockey in the Swedish HockeyAllsvenskan, becoming an instant hit with the club's fans for his NHL skills and aggressive play. The most influential player in the squad, Hunter came close to leading the unfancied club to promotion, leading the side to a sensational 5‚Äì4 victory against multiple Swedish champions Bryn√§s IF away from home in the playoffs. In the end, a defeat in the return leg ended Nyk√∂ping's hopes. Hunter then become an important player for the Islanders. He was consistently among the NHL leaders in hits and was one of the Islanders best penalty killers. On July 28, 2011, Hunter was traded to the New Jersey Devils in exchange for winger Brian Rolston. Traded to the Devils for salary cap purposes, on August 1, 2011, Hunter was placed on waivers by the Devils along with Colin White. He was then bought out from the final two years of his contract on August 2 after clearing. On September 14, 2011 it was announced that Hunter would sign a professional tryout contract with the Los Angeles Kings to attend the pre- season camp for the 2011‚Äì12 campaign.

Previous to leading Goldman Sachs, he was the company's president and chief operating officer (COO) from 2004 to 2006, serving under then-CEO Hank Paulson. Born and raised in New York City, Blankfein attended Harvard University for his undergraduate and law school studies before briefly entering private law practice. In 1982, he became a precious metals salesman at J. Aron & Co., a small commodities trading firm which was acquired by Goldman in 1981. After leading Goldman's currency and commodities divisions from 1994 to 1997 he was named heir apparent despite ranking third in the corporate hierarchy. He served as the president and chief operating officer from 2004 to his ascension to chief executive. Almost immediately after Blankfein assumed the head of the company, the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08 hit the banking industry. His role and handling of the crisis was widely praised and criticized by media outlets, making him a public figure. After the Federal Reserve implemented dovish monetary policies and the U.S. Treasury bailed out the company, Blankfein took advantage of low interest rates to undercut competition from other investment banks and established Goldman Sachs as the second largest investment bank in the U.S. as others either went bankrupt or fell to acquisition. Blankfein was twice named one of the most influential people in the world by Time magazine and won the Financial Times Person of the Year award in 2009. According to Bloomberg News, his net worth is estimated to be US$1.1 billion as of July 2015. His salary at Goldman Sachs in 2018 was estimated to be $24 million.  Early life and career  Lloyd Craig Blankfein was born in The Bronx borough of New York City on September 20, 1954. His father, Seymour Blankfein, was a clerk with the U.S. Postal Service branch in the Manhattan borough of New York City and his mother was a receptionist.Gapper, John \\"Master of risk who did God's work for Goldman Sachs but won it little love\\" Financial Times.

He received primary and secondary education in New York City's public schools graduating valedictorian at Thomas Jefferson High School in 1971. He went on to attend Harvard College where he lived in Winthrop House and graduated with an A.B. in history in 1975. After graduating college, he attended Harvard Law School where he received a J.D. degree in 1978. Blankfein first worked for the law firms Proskauer Rose and then Donovan, Leisure, Newton & Irvine. In 1982, he joined the commodities trading firm J. Aron & Co. as a precious metals salesman in its London office. The firm was later acquired by the investment bank, Goldman Sachs.

After Paulson consolidated control of Goldman, he identified Blankfein as his heir apparent, despite Blankfein ranking third in the corporate hierarchy behind two co-presidents. In 2004, Blankfein was promoted to president and chief operating officer, a position he served in until June 2006. As president, he oversaw the 2000s commodities boom and positioned Goldman to take advantage of rising commodity prices. On May 30, 2006, U.S. President George W. Bush nominated Paulson to serve as the 74th United States Secretary of the Treasury which prompted Paulson to establish a succession plan. Shortly after Paulson was sworn in, Blankfein was asked to serve as chairman and chief executive officer in July 2006. = 2007‚Äì08 financial crisis = During the 2007‚Äì08 financial crisis, many financial institutions that had dealings in subprime mortgages received a high level of public attention. Goldman Sachs served as a market maker that dealt with financial products that held subprime mortgages. During late 2008, the crisis led the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates and the U.S. Treasury to increase public spending in private banks. Following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and the government bailout of Goldman, Blankfein used the low interest rates and government assistance to undercut competition from other investment banks and established Goldman Sachs as the second largest investment bank in the U.S. as others either went bankrupt or fell to acquisition. In 2009, he was named Financial Times Person of the Year. His citation noted that \\"his bank stuck to its strengths, unashamedly [took] advantage of the low interest rates and diminished competition resulting from the crisis to make big trading profits.\\"\\"Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein Named Financial Times Person Of The Year\\". The Huffington Post. Retrieved December 25, 2009. On January 13, 2010, Blankfein voluntarily testified before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission that he considered Goldman Sachs's role as primarily market maker, not a creator of the product (i.e., subprime mortgage-related securities). Blankfein testified once more before Congress in April 2010 at a hearing of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. He said that Goldman Sachs had no moral or legal obligation to inform their clients they were betting against the products they were selling to them because it was not acting in a fiduciary role. Senator Carl Levin accused Blankfein of misleading Congress; however, no perjury charges were brought against Blankfein. Nevertheless, as a precaution Blankfein hired Reid Weingarten, a high-profile defense lawyer who represented former WorldCom CEO Bernard Ebbers and former Enron accounting officer Richard Causey.Witkowski, Wallace,\\"Goldman Sachs says Blankfein hires Weingarten: WSJ\\", MarketWatch, August 22, 2011.

Smith claimed that employees were promoted for unloading less profitable products on clients, for trading products that maximized Goldman Sachs' profits, not their clients, and trading illiquid, opaque products. Smith's op-ed was criticized by many, particularly because he worked at Goldman for 12 years before deciding to quit because of moral objections. Blankfein, with Lionel Barber and Raghuram Rajan, at the FT and Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year Award ceremony in 2010. In February 2018, to counter low sales and trading profits, Blankfein instituted new hiring priorities. He instructed human resource managers at the firm to focus on employment candidates who were \\"strategists\\" or \\"strats,\\" i.e., highly quantitative and technologically proficient. On March 15, 2018, Blankfein issued an internal memo advocating for complete gender parity among its workforce. He stated: \\"At Goldman Sachs we pay women and men in similar roles with similar performance equally. However, the real issue for our firm and many corporations is the under-representation of women and diverse professionals both in magnitude and levels of seniority. We have made some progress, but we have significant work to do, and we, as leaders of our firm, are committed to doing this critical work.\\" = Leadership style = Research published at the University of Oxford characterizes Blankfein's leadership style as paradigmatic of \\"founder centrism\\" ‚Äì which is a founder's mindset, an ethical disposition towards the shareholder collective, and an intense focus on exponential value creation. (\\"Founder centrism, an inclusive concept within Concentrated Equity Ownership (CEO) theory, integrates the capacity of both founder and non-founder senior leadership to adopt an owner‚Äôs mindset in traditionally structured corporations, such as Thomas J.

In substance, all fall within the ambit of founder centrism\\".) = Compensation = Blankfein's compensation at Goldman Sachs has been at the center of controversy and interest to financial reporters and the general public. He was paid a base salary of $600,000 with a total compensation package of $54.4 million in 2006 as the highest-paid executive on Wall Street. His bonus reflected the performance of Goldman Sachs, which reported record net earnings of $9.5 billion.

In March 2020, he said ‚Äúextreme measures to flatten the virus ‚Äòcurve‚Äô‚Äù were sensible ‚Äúfor a time‚Äù but that they could crush the economy. He said, ‚ÄúWithin a very few weeks let those with a lower risk to the disease return to work.‚Äù In May 2020, amid reopenings of the economy, Blankfein said that the U.S. would have to suffer through a spike in coronavirus cases because the U.S. could not provide additional coronavirus-related stimulus. At the time, he wrote, \\"Is the public health benefit from broad lockdowns at this point worth such extreme damage to livelihoods?\\" CBS News described Blankfein as \\"a leading spokesperson\\" for the \\"reopen the economy\\" movement. = Wealth tax = Blankfein opposes a wealth tax on billionaires. In 2019, while criticizing Elizabeth Warren's wealth tax, he alluded to her Native American heritage, saying \\"Maybe tribalism is just in her DNA.\\" Under her wealth tax proposal, Blankfein would have owed more than $30 million per year in taxes on his estimated $1.1 billion wealth. Blankfein who earned $24 million from Goldman Sachs in 2018 criticized the notion that CEOs are overpaid. In 2019, he said he felt a \\"lack of appreciation\\" in society for Wall Streeters. Philanthropy Blankfein's total compensation from 2000 to 2009 was estimated to be around $240 million. During this time period he personally donated $11 million (4.58% of his total compensation) to charitable organizations. His joint charity foundation, the Lloyd and Laura Blankfein Foundation, donated $620,000 to Harvard Law School, $500,000 to the Ethical Culture Fieldston School, $50,000 to Barnard College, $46,500 to the Robin Hood Foundation, and $10,000 to Carnegie Hall in fiscal year 2010. He serves on the board of directors of the Partnership for New York City, and on the board of overseers of the Weill Cornell Medical College. Personal life Blankfein is married to Laura Jacobs, an attorney and the daughter of Norman S. Jacobs, the editor-in-chief of the Foreign Policy Association publications. The couple have two sons, Alexander and Jonathan, and a daughter, Rachel.Julia La Roche, Hey Look, Lloyd Blankfein's Kids Are On Instagram, Business Insider, July 27, 2012 On September 22, 2015, Blankfein was diagnosed with a form of lymphoma.

Santamaria's secretive anti- communist \\"Movement.\\" In this position McManus supported the Industrial Groups which the party had set up within trade unions to combat the influence of the Communist Party of Australia. After Labor's defeat in the 1954 federal election, the federal Leader, Dr H. V.

McManus was elected to the Senate at the 1955 federal election as an ALP (Anti- Communist) candidate, whose ticket polled 17.8 percent of the vote in Victoria.McManus sure of Senate seat (17 December 1955). The Argus (Melbourne), p. 6. Retrieved 6 May 2014 He was defeated in 1961, but re- elected in 1964 and again in 1970. At the 1970 election, campaigning on the slogan \\"Vote Mac Back\\", he polled 19.1 percent, the DLP's best-ever result. In the Senate, the DLP had between one and five Senators between 1955 and 1974, led first by George Cole of Tasmania and then by Vince Gair of Queensland, with McManus as Deputy Leader. The DLP gave critical support to the Liberal governments of Robert Menzies and his successors, pressing them to adopt more militantly anti-communist policies both domestically and internationally, particularly on issues such as the Vietnam War and the recognition of the People's Republic of China believing there was a real threat from communist domination.DLP outlines defence plan (29 August 1969). The Canberra Times, p. 3. Retrieved 6 May 2014 They also supported conservative Catholic views on social issues. On some issues, such as pensions, the DLP supported traditional Labor policies. In 1973, following the election of the Whitlam Labor government, Gair was forced out as DLP Leader and was succeeded by McManus, who at 68 was only three years younger than Gair. The election of Whitlam had robbed the DLP of most of its influence, and Gair's acceptance of the post of Ambassador to Ireland from Whitlam split the party and caused a collapse in its support. In 1974 the DLP supported the Liberal leader, Billy Snedden, in threatening to block the Whitlam government's budget bills in the Senate. When Whitlam responded by immediately calling an election for both the House and Senate (a double dissolution), McManus informed the Victorian Central Executive that Billy Snedden had agreed to the Liberals running a joint Senate ticket with the DLP, which would have guaranteed him a winnable Senate spot. But this joint ticket did not eventuate, and all the DLP Senators lost their seats, McManus polling only 6.4 percent in Victoria. Later life McManus ran for the Senate again at the 1975 election following the fall of the Whitlam government, but was not elected, his vote falling to 5.8 percent. In 1976 he resigned as leader and the party was wound up in 1978. He died in Melbourne in 1983 leaving a wife and four children.

The building was modeled after the Concertgebouw concert hall in Amsterdam, and it was inaugurated on 31 October 1894 with a performance by the Boston Symphony Orchestra and Australian opera singer Nellie Melba as the featured soloist. Beginning 1904, it was also used for touring performances by the Metropolitan Opera, and from 1950, it was the home of the Baltimore Opera Company until that company's liquidation in 2009.

However Kahn's purchase caused the venue's name to be changed to the Lyric Theatre.Lyric Opera House History. Lyric Opera House. Retrieved 12 December 2013 and firmed up the continuity of the Metropolitan Opera's annual visits. In the early 20th century, the Lyric Opera featured opera tenor Enrico Caruso who appeared there with the Metropolitan Opera in a performance of Flotow's Martha. In 1950, building on earlier amateur efforts, the Baltimore Opera was formally established as the Baltimore Civic Opera Company, with the famous American soprano Rosa Ponselle as its first artistic director. She brought Beverly Sills to Baltimore for a production of Manon in 1952. By 1970, the name was changed to Baltimore Opera Company and had become firmly established at the Lyric. Having been modeled on the Concertgebouw, the Lyric was primarily used as a concert hall. 1916 saw the founding of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra which presented performances there until 1982, while the building was purchased from Kahn in 1920 and a significant renovation created an enlarged balcony with seating capacity reaching 2,800. In March 1974, the Lyric's 75th anniversary featured the return of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and throughout these years, the Philadelphia Orchestra made regular appearances in Baltimore until April 1980. A highlight was the 1934 premiere of Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini, with the composer at the piano. =Other events= Many different kinds of events were presented at the Lyric, including sporting events such as the 1905 lightweight boxing fight between Joe Gans, the lightweight champion, and Mike Sullivan and the 1906 wrestling bout between Gus Schoenlein and the world champion, George Hackenschmidt, the world champion of the time. The first public showing of electric cooking in Baltimore took place, as well as hosting speakers like Aimee Semple McPherson, Will Rogers, Richard Byrd, Clarence Darrow, Amelia Earhart, Charles Lindbergh and William Jennings Bryan. Performers appearing at the Lyric included in April/May 1984 Yul Brynner who starred in The King and I which over 70,000 people attended in four weeks.

According to its website, its goals are to \\"preserve America's Judeo-Christian heritage, defend the religious freedom of Christians, restore time-honored moral and family values, protect the sanctity of human life, and promote a strong national defense and a free and sovereign United States of America.\\" The Thomas More Law Center is active in social issues such as opposing same-sex marriage, abortion, and provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the HHS Mandate. The Law Center has been involved, often unsuccessfully, in high-profile cases including the litigation of the Dover, Pennsylvania intelligent design case, the defense of Lt Col Jeffrey Chessani against misconduct allegations stemming from the November 2005 Haditha incident, and the Law Center's federal lawsuit against the US Government regarding the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Individual Mandate. The Law Center also litigates cases related to the defense of Christians and anti-abortion activists, and has successfully defended the use of dark money in American elections. Founding and history The Center was founded in 1999 by Domino's Pizza founder Tom Monaghan and the Center's current President and Chief Counsel Richard Thompson, a former Oakland County, Michigan, prosecutor known for his role in the prosecution of Jack Kevorkian. Among those who have sat on the Center's advisory board are Senator Rick Santorum, former Senator and retired Rear Admiral Jeremiah Denton, former Major League Baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn, Catholic academic Charles Rice, Mary Cunningham Agee, and Ambassador Alan Keyes. The Center's Citizens' Advisory Board also includes Representative Michele Bachmann and Lieutenant Colonel Allen West.http://www.thomasmore.org/about/citizens-advisory- board/citizens-advisory-board The Center is primarily financed by contributions from individuals, foundations, and corporations and is recognized by the IRS as a 501(c)(3) organization. =Name= The Center is named after Thomas More, an English lawyer, social philosopher, author, statesman and Renaissance humanist. He was an important councillor to Henry VIII and was Lord Chancellor.Linder, Douglas O. The Trial of Sir Thomas More: A Chronology at University Of Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC) School Of Law More opposed the Protestant Reformation, in particular the theology of Martin Luther and William Tyndale, whose books he burned. More later opposed the King's separation from the Catholic Church and refused to accept him as Supreme Head of the Church of England because it disparaged papal authority. More was tried for treason, convicted, and beheaded. Thomas More is the patron saint of lawyers in the Catholic Church. Notable casesIntelligent design= * Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District The Thomas More Law Center represented the defendants in one of the country's first intelligent design cases, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District. :Prior to taking on this particular case, the lawyers of the Thomas More Law Center traveled the country seeking a school board willing to withstand a lawsuit as a test case for the teaching of intelligent design in public schools, forcing the first test case for intelligent design in the courts. :In a May 2000 visit to Charleston, West Virginia, Robert Muise, one of the lawyers, tried to persuade the school board to buy and use Of Pandas and People as a textbook for its science classes. Muise warned the board in Charleston that it would undoubtedly be sued if the district taught intelligent design, but that the Thomas More Law Center would provide legal defense at no cost. Muise told the board they could defend teaching intelligent design as a matter of academic freedom. :In the summer of 2004, the Dover, Pennsylvania, school board, after receiving legal advice from the Discovery Institute, accepted the center's offer of advice and possible representation, as they worked to change their science curriculum. On November 19, 2004, the Defendant Dover Area School District announced by press release that, commencing in January 2005, teachers would be required to read the following statement to students in the ninth grade biology class at Dover High School: > The Pennsylvania Academic Standards require students to learn about Darwin's > Theory of Evolution and eventually to take a standardized test of which > evolution is a part. Because Darwin's Theory is a theory, it continues to be > tested as new evidence is discovered. The Theory is not a fact. Gaps in the > Theory exist for which there is no evidence. A theory is defined as a well- > tested explanation that unifies a broad range of observations. Intelligent > Design is an explanation of the origin of life that differs from Darwin's > view. The reference book, Of Pandas and People, is available for students > who might be interested in gaining an understanding of what Intelligent > Design actually involves. With respect to any theory, students are > encouraged to keep an open mind. The school leaves the discussion of the > Origins of Life to individual students and their families. As a Standards- > driven district, class instruction focuses upon preparing students to > achieve proficiency on Standards-based assessments. The book Of Pandas and People, of which a large number had been donated to the school by a member of the school board who purchased them using money he had given to his father, Donald Bonsell, and said they were donations solicited from his church. A month later, on December 14, 2004, the ACLU and Americans United for Separation of Church and State filed suit on behalf of eleven Dover parents, claiming that the statement was a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The Center defended the school district in the trial, which lasted from September 26 through November 4. The case was decided on December 20, 2005. Judge John E. Jones III delivered a 139 page decision in favor of the plaintiffs, ruling that Intelligent Design is not science but essentially religious in nature, and consequently inappropriate for a biology class. Members of the board that had originally enacted the policy were not re-elected, preventing an appeal. The judge was scathing about the conduct of the defendants, saying \\"It is ironic that several of these individuals, who so staunchly and proudly touted their religious convictions in public, would time and again lie to cover their tracks and disguise the real purpose behind the ID Policy\\" and \\"The students, parents, and teachers of the Dover Area School District deserved better than to be dragged into this legal maelstrom, with its resulting utter waste of monetary and personal resources\\". =Christian religious freedom issues= *Travis Leach In 2001, the Law Center faxed a letter in defense of Traverse City, Michigan, police veteran Travis Leach, after he raised a religious objection to the city's newly adopted diversity measure which put rainbow flag bumper stickers on city vehicles, including police cruisers. Leach, a devout Christian, objected to the stickers as promoting the homosexual lifestyle, which he considered a sin. The city's Human Rights Commission requested that Leach's fitness as a police officer be investigated. On the same day the letter was faxed, Police Chief Ralph Soffredine announced Leach had been cleared. * Hansen et al., v Ann Arbor Public Schools et al. In July 2002, the Thomas More Law Center sued the Ann Arbor Public School system for violating a student's constitutional right to freedom of speech and right to equal protection, as well as the Establishment Clause. The Center won the case, with the judge ruling that the district had violated the student's rights by not allowing her to participate in a \\"Diversity Week\\" panel discussion concerning homosexuality and religion because she wished to discuss her Catholic faith.\\"Judge: Ann Arbor schools violated student's rights.\\" Associated Press, 8 December 2003 * Skoros v. City of New York The Thomas More Law Center, in December 2002, sued New York's school district in December 2002, saying a school policy was discriminatory against Roman Catholics by not allowing Nativity displays at Christmas but allowing the display of the Jewish menorah and the Islamic Star and Crescent during certain religious holidays and observances. Judge Charles P. Sifton of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York rejected The Center's constitutional claims. The 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the lower court's decision in February 2006. *Johnson v. Poway Unified School District The Center filed a federal lawsuit against a Southern California school district on behalf of math teacher Brad Johnson who was ordered to remove several banners from his classroom because school officials claimed the banners promoted an impermissible Judeo-Christian viewpoint. The banners contained slogans such as \\"In God We Trust\\" and \\"One Nation Under God\\". The school district filed a motion to dismiss and in a lengthy opinion the federal judge denied the motion, ruling in the Center's favor. Upon the completion of discovery, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The court granted summary judgment for the plaintiff. On September 13, 2011, the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the summary judgment and ruled that the school district did not violate Johnson's free speech rights. The unanimous decision of the federal appeals court relied on U.S. Supreme Court rulings that said governments can limit the free speech rights of public employees in the workplace. =Abortion & euthanasia issues= *Bernardo v. Planned Parenthood Federation of America In August 2001, the Thomas More Law Center filed a lawsuit against Planned Parenthood Federation of America and its affiliate Planned Parenthood of San Diego and Riverside Counties on behalf of three California women. The lawsuit accused Planned Parenthood of misleading women about the safety of abortion. The Thomas More Law Center on behalf of the plaintiffs demanded that Planned Parenthood inform women of a link between abortion and breast cancer. Although Planned Parenthood and medical experts denied any such link, a Thomas More Law Center lawyer claimed that a \\"preponderance of medical evidence\\" did establish a link.\\"Planned Parenthood sued over abortion's risk.\\" San Diego Union-Tribune, August 16, 2001. The case was dismissed by the judge, who said there was little likelihood the lawsuit would succeed.\\"Suit alleging abortion-cancer link dismissed.\\" San Diego Union-Tribune, March 21, 2002. This particular case was dismissed on appeal on a procedural issue under California's anti-SLAPP statute as the information concerning the link between abortion and breast cancer provided by Planned Parenthood on its website \\"did not concern any product or service within the meaning of the UCL, nor did it concern or advertise any product or service within the meaning of the FAL, and thus did not fall within the ambit of these consumer protection statutes.\\" *Martin v. Larsen In 2001, the Law Center filed a lawsuit against Great Falls, Montana, Assistant City Attorney Kory Larsen and two other city officials claiming they violated protesters rights with an already-removed one-week ban on graphic signs depicting aborted fetuses. Larsen, along with two unidentified police officers, ordered abortion protesters on August 10, 2001, to remove signs with graphic pictures of aborted fetuses from a spot in front of the Great Falls Planned Parenthood office. Larsen said the signs were creating a public nuisance and were a risk to public safety. *Schiavo et al. v Schiavo The Thomas More Law Center also got involved in the Terri Schiavo case in Florida in October 2003, sending Governor Jeb Bush a legal opinion stating that he could order a criminal investigation into whether or not Michael Schiavo had abused his wife. Richard Thompson, who authored and signed the legal opinion, claimed there was ample evidence suggesting that Terri may have been the victim of domestic abuse, which in turn caused her collapse and coma. The letter also contended that Michael had a conflict of interest concerning Terri's medical decisions. The Florida legislature passed \\"Terri's Law\\", giving Bush the authority to intervene in Schiavo's case and have her life- sustaining measures reconnected. The law was later deemed unconstitutional by Judge W. Douglas Baird, a Circuit Judge in the Florida Sixth Circuit. Schiavo's feeding and hydration tubes were removed on March 18, 2005, and she died on March 31, 2005. *Fitzgerald v. City of Portland In February 2014, the Law Center sued the City of Portland, Maine, on behalf of several pro-life activists concerning Portland City Ordinance ¬ß 17-108-111, which creates a Prohibited Zone where \\"[n]o person shall knowingly enter or remain on a public way or sidewalk adjacent to a reproductive health care facility with a radius of 39 feet of any portion of an entrance, exit, or driveway of a reproductive health care facility.\\" The United States Supreme Court in June 2014 declared a similar 35-foot prohibited zone in Massachusetts to be unconstitutional. In July, the Portland City Council voluntarily repealed the ordinance. Most of the lawsuit was then dismissed as moot, but as of October 2014, a portion of the lawsuit seeking nominal damages of one dollar in recognition of past constitutional harm remained. =Homosexuality issues= *In RE: The Estate of Marshall M. Gardiner In 2002, the Law Center was the only organization to file an amicus brief opposing the notion that a sex change operation truly changes a person's sex for the purpose of marriage. At issue was whether Marshall Gardiner's wife, J'Noel Ball, was eligible to receive one-half of his sizeable estate after he died without a will. J'Noel was designated male at birth, had sex reassignment therapy and had her Wisconsin birth certificate changed to reflect that she was a woman and not a man. The Kansas Supreme Court determined that \\"J'Noel remains a transsexual, and a male for purposes of marriage under K.S.A.2001 Supp. 23-101.\\" *Rohde v Ann Arbor Public Schools MEA NEA In September 2003 the Thomas More Law Center filed a lawsuit against the Ann Arbor Public School District on behalf of 17 individual taxpayers who had sent the school district letters requesting they stop using the public funds for employee domestic partnership benefits. The Center argued that the use of taxpayer funds to provide insurance benefits to same-sex domestic partners circumvented the 1996 Michigan Defense of Marriage Act, which define marriage as \\"inherently a unique relationship between a man and a woman.\\" On July 25, 2007, the Michigan Supreme Court ruled that the individuals did not have the constitutional standing to sue the Ann Arbor Public School District. The case was eventually dismissed due to lack of standing. *American Family Association v Michigan State University The Thomas More Law Center filed a similar lawsuit against Michigan State University in July 2006 after Michigan passed the Marriage Protection Amendment to the Michigan Constitution in 2004. The constitutional amendment defined \\"the union between a man and a woman\\" as \\"the only agreement recognized as a marriage or similar union for any purpose.\\" The Michigan Supreme Court ruled that the amendment banning same-sex marriages also blocks Michigan governments and state universities from offering \\"domestic partnership\\" benefits for homosexual couples. The ruling, however, had little effect since most public employers relaxed their eligibility criteria to avoid violating the amendment's restrictions. *Charter Amendment One (Gainesville, Florida) The City Council of Gainesville, Florida, voted to enact protection for sexual preference and gender identity in January 2008. The Thomas More Law Center wrote an amendment to repeal the protection that went to popular vote on March 24, 2009, losing with 42% of the vote in favor of repeal and 58% against repeal.Voters say no to Amend. 1, The Gainesville Sun, March 25, 2009. Retrieved on March 25, 2009. =Islam issues= *Eklund v Byron Union School District In July 2002, the Thomas More Law Center filed a lawsuit against Contra Costa County's Byron Union School District on behalf of the parents of four students. The suit argued that the curriculum required that \\"students pretend to be Muslims, wear robes, simulate jihads via a dice game, learn the Five Pillars of Faith and memorize verses from the Koran in classroom exercises as part of a World History and Geography class\\" and thus violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals found that the curriculum did not amount to an unconstitutional school sponsorship of a specific religion. The U.S. Supreme Court declined review of the case. *Kevin Murray v. U.S. Treasury Sec. Timothy Geithner, et al. The Law Center filed a federal lawsuit against the Department of Treasury and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, challenging a portion of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 that appropriated $40 billion in taxpayer money to fund the federal government's majority ownership interest in AIG. The lawsuit claimed that the federal government, through its ownership of AIG, engages in Sharia-based Islamic religious activities. The Center claimed the use of taxpayer dollars to fund Shariah-based Islamic religious activities violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. While federal Judge Lawrence P. Zatkoff was requested by the Department of Justice to dismiss the lawsuit in 2009, he reached a summary judgment in January, 2011, noting that the religious involvement did not achieve the \\"excessive entanglement\\" required under a precedential ruling. *Olmsted Falls, Ohio In October 2013, the Law Center threatened the Olmsted Falls City School District into removing what the center described as an \\"Islamic proselytizing video\\" from the 7th grade world history curriculum. The School District felt it could not spare the funds to defend itself in court. The film in question comes from the FX television network's 30 Days series featuring Morgan Spurlock of Super Size Me fame. The specific episode, \\"Muslims and America\\", followed a Christian man who is transported to Dearborn, Michigan where he lives with a Muslim family, attends prayer services and religious instruction in a mosque and otherwise lives as a Muslim. =Military and national security issues= *LtCol Jeffrey Chessani Jeffrey R. Chessani was a United States Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel and the commanding officer 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines during the time of the November 19, 2005, urban combat in Haditha, Iraq, where Marines in his battalion were accused of having killed 15 civilians while pursuing insurgents. The Thomas More Law Center defended Chessani against the charge that he failed to investigate the killings, and all criminal charges against Chessani regarding this incident have been dismissed. He was also defended by the Center before an administrative Board of Inquiry wherein the Board found that there was no misconduct. Chessani retired from the US Marine Corps on July 16, 2010. :On June 17, 2008, Military Judge Colonel Steven Folsom dismissed all charges against Chessani on the grounds that General James Mattis, who approved the filing of charges against Chessani, was improperly influenced by an investigator probing the incident. The ruling was without prejudice, which allows the prosecution to refile. :In 2008 an appeal filed on behalf of the Marine Corps claims that a judge abused his power when he dismissed dereliction of duty charges against Chessani. On March 17, 2009, a military appeals court upheld the dismissal. *Downey v. United States Department of the Army In November 2014, the Law Center filed a federal lawsuit against the United States Department of the Army and the Secretary of the Army John M. McHugh on behalf of Lt. Col. Christopher Downey. Downey was administratively convicted in an Article 15 procedure of assaulting a soldier who was attempting to videotape two lesbian officers engaged in a public display of affection during a full-dress formal military ball at Ft. Drum, New York, as well as violating the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell. The lawsuit disputes these administrative convictions, saying that the soldier was never assaulted, but may have been accidentally hit as Downey sought to lower the camera being used to film the officers, who were kissing, fondling, and removing each other's jackets on the dance floor. The lawsuit states that Downey was seeking to stop the women's behavior of concern for their reputations and the reputation of the Army. A special three-officer \\"show cause\\" board, convened after the Article 15 conviction, which reviewed the punishment, unanimously ruled that the evidence showed Downey did not violate Army rules writing \\"[t]he allegation of conduct unbecoming an officer ‚Ä¶ is not supported by the preponderance of the evidence,\\" the board also voted to retain Lt. Col. Downey. The lawsuit accuses the Army of violating Downey's constitutional rights by preventing him from adequately defending himself and asks a federal judge to overturn the convictions. =Free speech= *Pro-life T-shirts During the early 2000s, the Law Center was involved in disputes involving pro-life T-shirts including those distributed by Rock for Life for National Pro-Life T-shirt Day. These black T-shirts and sweatshirts emblazoned with \\"Abortion is Homicide\\" were deemed inappropriate by administrators of schools in Virginia, California, Texas, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, and Maine. The Law Center distributed a copy of a similar legal memo to students participated in National Pro-Life T-shirt Day. The Law Center also successfully defended Samantha Gallardo's pro-life T-shirts in California in 2002. *Savage v Napolitano In 2009, American radio talk show Michael Savage was banned from entry into the United Kingdom as he is \\"considered to be engaging in unacceptable behaviour by seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred which might lead to inter-community violence\\"US talkshow host Michael Savage to sue Jacqui Smith over ban from Britain Alex Spillius, telegraph.co.uk, 06 May 2009. by the United Kingdom's Home Secretary. Savage and lawyers from Thomas More Law Center appealed to then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, asking that Savage's name be removed from the list of individuals barred from entering the UK. :On July 12, 2010, the new Coalition government, of which the Conservative Party's David Cameron was Prime Minister, announced that it will continue to ban Savage from entering the UK. As of 2017, Savage remains banned from the UK. *Terry Jones Beginning in 2011, the Law Center has represented pastor Terry Jones in lawsuits against him and against the City of Dearborn. The lawsuits stem from Jones's anti-Islamic activities, including protests and the staged burning of the Koran. In April 2011, Jones planned to protest outside the Islamic Center of America. On the day he was to attend the protest, local authorities questioned him in Court, required him either to post a $45,000 \\"peace bond\\" to cover Dearborn's potential security costs. Jones contested that requirement, and the jury voted on April 22 to require the posting of a $1 \\"peace bond\\", but Jones and his co-pastor Wayne Sapp initially to refuse to pay. They were held briefly in jail, while claiming violation of First Amendment rights. That night Jones was released by the court after paying the reduced bond amount. :On November 11, 2011, Wayne County Circuit Court Judge Robert Ziolkowski vacated the \\"breach of peace\\" ruling against Jones and Wayne Sapp on the grounds that they were denied due process. *Glowacki v. Howell Public School District In 2011, the Law Center filed a lawsuit against Howell public school and one of its teachers on behalf of a student who was removed from the classroom on October 20, 2010 after expressing religious beliefs against the acceptance of homosexuality. According to the lawsuit, on the day that the district was observing the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) supported anti-homosexual-bullying Spirit Day, the student reacted to a fellow student being asked to remove a Confederate flag belt buckle by asking why it was permissible to display the gay pride flag. The suit further says that the teacher asked him if he supported gays, and that when the student said his Catholic religion prohibited him from doing so, the student and another student who shared his views were told to leave the class or face suspension. :In reference to the case, Richard Thompson, the Law Center's president and chief counsel said \\"The purpose of our lawsuit was to protect students' constitutional rights to free speech, defend religious liberty and stop public schools from becoming indoctrination centers for the homosexual agenda.\\" In June 2013, the claims against Howell Schools were dismissed, however, the claims that the teacher involved violated the student's First Amendment right to Free Speech were granted and the teacher was ordered to pay $1 for the violation. =Ten Commandments monuments= *Summum v. Duchesne City In 2003, the Law Center took up the defense of a Ten Commandments monument in Duchesne City, Utah. The Ten Commandments went up in Roy Park in Duchesne City in 1979, a donation by the family of the late Irvin Cole. After Summum filed suit, the city deeded the monolith and its 10-by-11-foot plot to the local Lions Club for $10 and 10,000 hours of already performed beautification services. After U.S. District Judge Dee Benson expressed concern about how the transfer was carried out, the city undid the transaction and sold the monument and land to three Cole daughters for $250. Judge Benson deemed in her summary judgement that the city's \\"efforts to disassociate itself from further involvement with the Ten Commandments monument are sufficient...\\" This case is a companion case to Pleasant Grove City v. Summum. The lawsuits made their way to the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where a panel said the municipalities must allow Summum to put up its monuments. Both municipalities then asked the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the 10th Circuit ruling. In the Pleasant Grove case, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously in February 2009 that the city did not violate Summum's free-speech rights when it refused permission to place a Seven Aphorisms monument in a public park. The high court never ruled on the Duchesne suit, which was sent back to U.S. District Judge Dale Kimball in Salt Lake City for a decision based on the Pleasant Grove ruling. However unlike in Pleasant Grove, whose park includes several other donated monuments or displays, Duchesne's park only had the Ten Commandments monument. Eventually, Duchesne officials decided to move the Ten Commandments monument from Roy Park to the city cemetery to avoid continued litigation. *Society of Separationists v. Pleasant Grove City et al. In 2004, the Law Center defended a Ten Commandments monument that has stood since 1971 in a public park in Pleasant Grove City, Utah. The suit filed by the Society of Separationists against the city was initially dismissed by Judge Bruce S. Jenkins. However, in 2005, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed the lower court's grant of judgment on the pleadings and remanded the case back to the district court for further proceedings. In 2006, after the Supreme Court's ruling in Van Orden v. Perry, which described the constitutionality of a Ten Commandments monument in at the Texas State Capitol in Austin, Texas, the Society of Separationists asked that the lawsuit be dismissed. = Christmas = *Donnell v. Palm Beach Town Council In 2003, the Law Center filed a lawsuit on behalf of two Palm Beach residents against the town for not allowing them to put a nativity scene next to the town's two menorah displays. The lawsuit alleged that for the past two years the town had permitted the public display of menorahs, or Jewish candelabras, at various prominent public locations, and that town officials had repeatedly refused to review requests to have Christian Nativity scenes displayed alongside them. In September 2003, the women represented by the suit requested that the town permit a privately financed display of a Christian nativity scene alongside the menorahs. They also made four additional requests in October and November, requesting that town officials respond by December 1, but they did not. On December 16, 2003 U.S. District Judge Daniel T.K. Hurley, gave town officials 48 hours to respond to the request. Hurley said the town's inaction on the request since September may be a constitutional violation because the women were entitled to a timely answer. The town council eventually denied the request. :After a consent judgement was entered in favor of the nativity display, the city of Palm Beach was forced to pay attorney's fees and publicly apologize to the women. *Snowden v. Town of Bay Harbor Islands In 2004, the Law Center filed a lawsuit on behalf of Sandra Snowden against the Town of Bay Harbor Islands after Snowden was denied permission to display a Nativity for the second consecutive year on public property. :After the Town and Snowden reached a settlement of their dispute, Judge Cecilia Altonaga for the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida memorialized this settlement in a consent decree requiring the Town to allow Snowden to erect or sponsor displays on the piece of property for the next ten holiday seasons and to allow any other resident to erect or sponsor a display during the holidays. The decree also affirmed the Town's right to place reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions on these expressions. Among these restrictions were a size limitation, a time restriction limiting the displays to the holiday season, and a restriction on the number of displays each person could sponsor or erect each season, limiting that number to one. *Stratechuk v. Board of Education, South Orange-Maplewood School District et al. In 2004, the Law Center filed a lawsuit on behalf of Michael Stratechuk challenging New Jersey's Maplewood Public School District's ban on traditional Christmas music including instrumentals. Richard Thompson, the Law Center's chief counsel described the ban as \\"another example of the anti-Christmas, anti-religion policy infecting our public school system.\\" In a statement, school Superintendent Brian Osborne said the policy \\"was adopted to promote an inclusive environment for all students in our school community.\\" U.S. District Judge William H. Walls held that the school's policy has a valid secular purpose, does not convey a message of disapproval of religion, and does not foster an excessive entanglement with religion; the school concerts are not public fora and the interpretation of Policy 2270 is reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns. *John Satawa v. Mcomb County Road Commission In 2009, the Law Center filed a lawsuit on behalf of John Satawa in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division claiming Satawa's constitutional rights were violated when he was ordered to remove a Nativity scene from the median of a public road. The suit sought for Satawa to be allowed to put back the 8- by 8-foot Nativity scene his late father built in 1945. :After receiving a complaint by the Wisconsin-based Freedom From Religion Foundation, the Road Commission of Macomb County told Satawa to remove the holiday display, citing incomplete permits. Satawa's permit application was later denied because it \\"clearly displays a religious message\\" and violated \\"separation of church and state,\\" according to Macomb County Highway Engineer Robert Hoepfner. :After a four year court battle, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled in favor of the display and the roads commission opted not to appeal the ruling, granting Satawa a permit for the display. =Same-sex marriage issues= *Michigan Marriage Amendment The Law Center played a substantial role in the drafting of Michigan's Marriage Amendment which was enacted by the voters in November 2004. The amendment made it unconstitutional for the state to recognize or perform same-sex marriages or civil unions. *National Black Pastors and Christian Leaders Coalition In May 2014, the Law Center announced a partnership with the National Coalition of Black Pastors and Christian Leaders to oppose legalization of same-sex marriage through the filing of amicus briefs filed on behalf of the pastors in what the Law Center deemed \\"key cases\\" around the country. The Law Center filed amicus briefs before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, Sixth Circuit, the Supreme Court. =Other= *Vasquez v. Los Angeles County In 2006, the Center's West Coast office filed a federal lawsuit against Los Angeles County officials for their decision to remove a small cross from the county seal after they were threatened with a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union and spent an estimated $700,000 dollars to replace the seal on thousands of government buildings, vehicles and uniforms. The Law Center argued that the same Constitutional clause the prevents the establishment of a state religion also forbids the government from taking actions that convey a message of hostility toward religion. The Center also provided legal supervision for a ballot initiative to keep the cross on the seal, which didn't generate enough signatures for placement on the ballot. However, in 2014, a cross was reintroduced to the L.A. County Seal in the interest of architectural and historical accuracy atop an included depiction of the San Gabriel Mission. In April 2016, the addition of the cross to the seal was ruled unconstitutional by a U.S. District Court judge. The county accepted the ruling. * Trunk v City of San Diego The Center's West Coast office intervened on behalf of the Citizens for the Mt. Soledad National War Memorial, to prevent the city of San Diego from removing a 29 ft cross from the existing Mt. Soledad war memorial. In December 2013, U.S. District Judge Larry Burns ruled that the cross must be removed. However, he issued a stay on the ruling allowing for the Law Center to appeal to the United States Supreme Court, asking for a stay in destruction of the memorial. In June 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to intervene in the two-decade old battle until the appellate court rules on the issue. :On July 20, 2015, a group called the Mt. Soledad Memorial Association reported that it had bought the land under the cross from the Dept. of Defense for $1.4 million. On September 7, 2016 the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a one-page ruling, ordering dismissal of the case and an end to all current appeals, stating that the case was now moot because the cross was no longer on government land. * Thomas More Law Center et al. v. Barack H. Obama et al. The Thomas More Law Center filed a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The purpose of the lawsuit was to permanently enjoin enforcement of the new health care legislation. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of the Center itself, and four individuals from the Southeastern Michigan area. None of the individuals had private health care insurance. Named as defendants in the lawsuit were: President Barack Obama, Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services; Eric H. Holder, Jr., U.S. Attorney General; and Timothy Geithner, Secretary of the US Department of Treasury. All the defendants were sued in their official capacity. On October 7, 2010, U.S. District Court Judge George Caram Steeh dismissed two out of six of their claims, upholding these provisions under Congress's interstate commerce clause powers. The court eventually ruled that the minimum coverage portion of the Act which was in question was Constitutionally sound, a ruling that was confirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in June, 2011.http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/11a0168p-06.pdf In July 2011, the Center petitioned the Supreme Court to review the case; that petition was denied in July 2012. *Brinsdon v. McAllen Independent School District In 2013, the Law Center filed a lawsuit against McAllen Independent School District, stating that a student enrolled in a high school Spanish class had been punished for refusing to recite the Mexican Pledge of Allegiance and Mexican National Anthem complete with arm outstretched in the appropriate posture. The school district does, however, have a policy that prohibits a school from compelling students to recite the American Pledge of Allegiance. The district also has a written policy that excuses students from reciting text from the Declaration of Independence if the student \\"as determined by the district, has a conscientious objection to the recitation.\\" :In January 2015, U.S. District Judge Micaela Alvarez of the Southern District of Texas dismissed the case, ruling that the student's attorneys provided no evidence of a school board policy that required students to recite the Mexican Pledge of Allegiance or sing the Mexican National Anthem, adding that teaching multiculturalism in public school is not inherently unconstitutional and that there was no evidence that the student's rights were violated. = Additional cases = The Thomas More Law Center casework also includes their defense of Father Ray Leonard; 12 challenges to the HHS mandate on behalf of various closely held corporations and non-profit groups; and the Law Center's defense of Lt. Col. Christopher Downey.

Early Baltimore was home to popular opera and musical theatre, and an important part of the music of Maryland, while the city also hosted several major music publishing firms until well into the 19th century, when Baltimore also saw the rise of native musical instrument manufacturing, specifically pianos and woodwind instruments. African American music existed in Baltimore during the colonial era, and the city was home to vibrant black musical life by the 1860s. Baltimore's African American heritage to the start of the 20th century included ragtime and gospel music. By the end of that century, Baltimore jazz had become a well-recognized scene among jazz fans, and produced a number of local performers to gain national reputations. The city was a major stop on the African American East Coast touring circuit, and it remains a popular regional draw for live performances. Baltimore has produced a wide range of modern rock, punk and metal bands and several indie labels catering to a variety of audiences. Music education throughout Maryland conforms to state standards, implemented by the Baltimore City Public School System. Music is taught to all age groups, and the city is also home to several institutes of higher education in music. The Peabody Institute's Conservatory is the most renowned music education facility in the area, and has been one of the top nationally for decades. The city is also home to a number of other institutes of higher education in music, the largest being nearby Towson University. The Peabody sponsors performances of many kinds, many of them classical or chamber music. Baltimore is home to the Baltimore Opera and the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, among other similar performance groups. Major music venues in Baltimore include the nightclubs and other establishments that offer live entertainment clustered in Fells Point and Federal Hill. History The documented history of music in Baltimore extends to the 1780s. Little is known about the cultural lives of the Native Americans who formerly lived along the Chesapeake Bay, prior to the founding of Baltimore. In the colonial era, opera and theatrical music were a major part of Baltimorean musical life, and Protestant churches were another important avenue for music performance and education. Baltimore rose to regional performance as an industrial and commercial center, and also become home to some of the most important music publishing firms in colonial North America. In the 19th century, Baltimore grew greatly, and its documented music expanded to include an abundance of African American music, and the city's denizens played a crucial role in the development of gospel music and jazz. Musical institutions based in Baltimore, including the Peabody Institute and the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, became fixtures in their respective fields, music education and Western classical music. Later in the 20th century, Baltimore produced notable acts in the fields of rock, R&B; and hip hop. =Colonial era to 1800= Local music in Baltimore can be traced back to 1784, when concerts were advertised in the local press. These concert programs featured compositions by locals Alexander Reinagle and Raynor Taylor, as well as European composers like Frantisek Kotzwara, Ignaz Pleyel, Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf, Giovanni Battista Viotti and Johann Sebastian Bach. Opera first came to Baltimore in 1752, with the performance of The Beggar's Opera by a touring company. It was soon followed by La Serva Padrona by Giovanni Battista Pergolesi, the American premier of that work, and the 1772 performance of Comus by John Milton, performed by the American Company of Lewis Hallam. This was soon followed by the creation of the first theatre in Baltimore, funded by Thomas Wall and Adam Lindsay's Maryland Company of Comedians, the first resident theatrical company in the city, which had been established despite a ban on theatrical entertainment by the Continental Congress in 1774. Maryland was the only state to so openly flout the ban, giving special permission to the Maryland Company in 1781, to perform both in Baltimore and Annapolis. Shakespearean and other plays made up the repertoire, often with wide-ranging modifications, including the addition of songs. The managers of the Maryland Company had some trouble finding qualified musicians to play in the theatre's orchestra. The Maryland Company and the American Company performed sporadically in Baltimore until the early 1790s, when the Philadelphia Company of Alexander Reinagle and Thomas Wignell began dominating, based out of their Holliday Street Theater. Formal singing schools were the first well-documented musical institution in Baltimore. They were common in colonial North America prior to the Revolutionary War, but were not established in Baltimore until afterwards, in 1789. These singing schools were taught by instructors known as masters, or singing masters, and were often itinerant; they taught vocal performance and techniques for use in Christian psalmody. The first singing school in Baltimore was founded in the courthouse, in 1789, by Ishmael Spicer, whose students would include the future John Cole. Publishing The first tunebook published in Maryland was the Baltimore Collection of Church Music by Alexander Ely in 1792, consisting mostly of hymns, with some more complex pieces described as anthems. In 1794, Joseph Carr established a shop in Baltimore, along with his sons Thomas and Benjamin, who ran shops in New York and Philadelphia. The Carrs would be the most successful publishing firm until around the start of the 19th century; however, they remained prominent until the company folded in 1821, and the Carrs were responsible for the first sheet music publication of \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" in 1814, arranged by Thomas Carr himself, and they also published European instrumentals and stage pieces, as well as works by Americans like James Hewitt and Alexander Reinagle. Much of this music was collected, in serial format, in the Musical Journal for the Piano Forte, which spanned five volumes and was the largest collection of secular music in the country. In the late 18th century, Americans like William Billings were establishing a bold, new style of vocal performance, markedly distinct from European traditions. John Cole, an important publisher and tune collector in Baltimore, known for pushing a rarefied European outlook on American music, responded with the tunebook Beauties of Psalmody, which denigrated the new techniques, especially fuguing. Cole continued publishing tunebooks up to 1842, and soon began operating his own singing school. Besides Cole, Baltimore was home to other major music publishers as well. These included Wheeler Gillet, who focused on dignified, European-style music like Cole did, and Samuel Dyer, who collected more distinctly American-styled songs. The tunebooks published in Baltimore included instructional notes, using a broad array of music education techniques then common. Ruel Shaw, for example, used a system derived from the work of Heinrich Pestalozzi, interpreted by the American Lowell Mason. Though the Pestalozzian system was widely used in Baltimore, other techniques were tried, such as that developed by local singing master James M. Deems, based on the Italian solfeggi system. =19th century= 19th-century Baltimore had a large African American population, and was home to a vibrant black musical life, especially based around the region's numerous Protestant churches. The city also boasted several major music publishing firms and instrument manufacturing companies, specializing in pianos and woodwind instruments. Opera, choral and other classical performance groups were founded during this era, many of them becoming regionally prominent and established a classical tradition in Baltimore. The Holliday Street Theatre and the Front Street Theatre hosted both touring and local productions throughout the early 19th century. Following the Civil War, however, a number of new theatres opened, including the Academy of Music, Ford's Grand Opera House and the Concordia Opera House, owned by the Concordia Music Society. Of these, Ford's was perhaps the most successful, home to no fewer than 24 different opera companies. By the start of the 20th century, however, the New York Theatrical Syndicate had grown to dominate the industry throughout the region, and Baltimore became a less common stop for touring companies. African American music During the 19th century, Maryland had one of the largest populations of free African Americans, totalling one fifth of all free blacks in the country. Baltimore was the center for African American culture and industry, and was home to many African American craftsmen, writers and other professionals, and some of the largest black churches in the country. Many African Americans institutions in Baltimore assisted the less fortunate with food and clothing drives, and other charitable work. The \\"first instance of mass black assertiveness after the Civil War\\" in the country occurred in Baltimore in 1865, after a meeting of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows in Battle Monument Square, marking the anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation. Another African American celebration occurred five years later, celebrating the right to vote, guaranteed to African Americans by the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Many bands played, including brass and cornet bands. Eubie Blake Baltimore's Eubie Blake, born in 1883, became a musician at an early age, hired as a house musician at a brothel, run by Aggie Shelton. He perfected his improvisational piano style, which used ragtime riffs, and eventually completed \\"The Charleston Rag\\", in 1899. With compositions like that, Blake pioneered what would eventually become known as the stride style by the end of the 1890s; stride later became more closely associated with New York City. With his own technique, characterized by playing the syncopation with his right hand and a steady beat with the left, and became one of the most successful ragtime performers of the East Coast, performing with prominent cabaret entertainers Mary Stafford and Madison Reed. =Church music= Black churches in Maryland hosted many musical, as well as political and educational, activities, and many African American musicians got their start performing in churches, including Anne Brown, Marian Anderson, Ethel Ennis and Cab Calloway, in the 20th century. Doctrinal disputes did not prevent musical cooperation, which included both sacred and secular music. Church choirs frequently worked together, even across denominational divides, and church-goers often visited other establishments to see visiting performers. Organists were a major part of African American church music in Baltimore, and some organists became well known, Baltimore's including Sherman Smith of Union Baptist, Luther Mitchell of Centennial Methodist and Julia Calloway of Sharon Baptist. Many churches also offered music education, beginning as early as the 1870s with St. Francis Academy. Charles Albert Tindley Charles Albert Tindley, born in 1851 in Berlin, Maryland, would become the first major composer of gospel music, a style that drew on African American spirituals, Christian hymns and other folk music traditions. Tindley's earliest musical experience likely included tarrying services, a musical tradition of the Eastern Shore of Maryland, wherein Christian worshipers prayed and sang throughout the night. He became an itinerant preacher as an adult, working at churches throughout Maryland, Delaware and New Jersey, then settled down as a pastor in Philadelphia, eventually opening a large church called Tindley Temple United Methodist Church. One of two surviving 1814 copies of what would eventually be known as \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" Publishing Though John Cole and the Carrs were among the first major music publishers in Baltimore, the city was home to a vibrant publishing tradition in the 19th century, aided by the presence of A. Hoen & Co., one of the biggest lithography firms of the era, who illustrated many music publications. Other prominent music publishers in Baltimore in this era included George Willig, Arthur Clifton, Frederick Benteen, James Boswell, Miller and Beecham, W. C. Peters, Samuel Carusi and G. Fred Kranz. Peters was well known nationally, but first established a Baltimore-based firm in 1849, with partners whose names remain unknown. His sons eventually joined the field, and the company, then known as W. C. Peters & Co., published the Baltimore Olio and Musical Gazette, which contained concert news, printed music, educational and biographical essays and articles. The pianist-composer Charles Grobe was among the contributors. Instrument manufacture Piano factory of Wm. Knabe & Co. in 1873 Baltimore was also home to the piano-building businesses of William Knabe and Charles Steiff. Knabe emigrated to the United States in 1831, and he founded the firm, with Henry Gaehle, in 1837. It began manufacturing pianos in 1839. The company became one of the most prominent and respected piano manufacturers in the country, and was the dominant corporation in the Southern market. The company floundered after a fire destroyed a factory, and the aftermath of the Civil War lessened demand in the Southern area where Knabe's sales were concentrated. By the end of the 19th century, however, Knabe's sons, Ernest and William, had re-established the firm as one of the leading piano companies in the country. They built sales in the west and north, and created new designs that made Knabe & Co. the third best-selling piano manufacturer in the country. The pianos were well regarded enough that the Japanese government chose Knabe as its supplier for schools in 1879. After the death of William and Ernest Knabe, the company went public. In the 20th century, Knabe's company became absorbed into other corporations, and the pianos are now manufactured by Samick, a Korean producer. Heinrich Christian Eisenbrandt, originally of G√∂ttingen, Germany, settled in Baltimore in 1819, going on to manufacture brass and woodwind instruments of high quality. His output included several brass instruments, flageolets, flutes, oboes, bassoons, clarinets with between five and sixteen keys, and at least one drum and basset-horn. Eisenbrandt owned two patents for brass instruments, and was once praised for \\"great improvements made in the valves\\" of the saxhorn. His flutes and clarinets won him a silver medal at the London Great Exhibition of 1851, and he also earned high marks for those instruments and the saxhorn at several Metropolitan Mechanics Institute exhibitions. The Smithsonian Institution now possesses one of Eisenbrandt's clarinets, adorned with jewels, and the Shrine to Music Museum at the University of South Dakota is in possession of a drum and several clarinets made by Eisenbrandt. He is also known to have made a cornet which uses a key mechanism that he had patented. Eisenbrandt died in 1861, and his son, H. W. R. Eisenbrandt, continued the business until at least 1918. Classical music The Peabody Orchestra, formed in 1866, was the first professional orchestra in Baltimore. The Orchestra premiered many works in its early years, including some by Asger Hamerik, a prominent Danish composer who became director of the Orchestra. Ross Jungnickel founded the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra before 1890, when the Orchestra first performed, and the Peabody Orchestra ceased to exist. Jungnickel's orchestra, however, lasted only until 1899. Traveling opera companies visited Baltimore throughout the 19th century, performing pieces like Norma, Faust and La sonnambula, with performances by well-known singers like Jenny Lind and Clara Kellogg. Institutions from outside Baltimore also presented opera within the city, including the Chicago Lyric Opera and the Metropolitan Opera. In the early 19th century, choral associations became common in Maryland, and Baltimore, buoyed by the immigration of numerous Germans. These groups were formed for the purpose of instruction in choral music, eventually performing oratorios. The popularity of these choral associations helped to garner support among the local population for putting music education in the city's public schools. The Baltimore Oratorio Society, the Liederkranz and the Germania M√§nnerchor were the most important of these associations, and their traditions were maintained into the 20th century by organizations like the Bach Choir, Choral Arts Society, Concert Artists of Baltimore, Handel Society and the Baltimore Symphony Chorus. Education John Hill Hewitt Singing schools in Baltimore were few in number until the 1830s. Singing masters began incorporating secular music into their curriculum, and divested themselves from sponsoring churches, in the early part of the 1830s. Attendance increased drastically, especially after the founding of two important institutions: the Academy, established in 1834 by Ruel Shaw, and the Musical Institute, founded by John Hill Hewitt and William Stoddard. The Academy and the Institute quickly became rivals, and both gave successful performances. Some Baltimore singing masters used new terminology to describe their programs, as the term singing school was falling out of favor; Alonzo Cleaveland founded the Glee School during this era, focusing entirely on secular music. In contrast, religious musical instruction by the middle of the 19th century remained based around itinerant singing masters who taught for a period of time, then continued to new locations. The introduction of music into Baltimore public schools in 1843 caused a slow decline in the popularity of private youth singing instruction. In response to the growing demand for printed music in schools, publishers began offering collections with evangelical tunes, directed at rural schools. Formal, adult musical institutions, like the Haydn Society and the Euterpe Musical Association, grew in popularity following the Civil War. =20th century= Early in the 20th century, Baltimore's most famous musical export was the duo of Eubie Blake and Noble Sissle, who found national fame in New York. Blake in particular became a ragtime legend, and innovator of the stride style. Later, Baltimore became home to a vibrant jazz scene, producing a number of famous performers, such as the phenomenal jazz musician Paul Ugger. Use of the Hammond B-3 organ later became an iconic part of Baltimore jazz. In the middle of the 20th century, Baltimore's major music media include Chuck Richards, a popular African American radio personality on WBAL, and Buddy Deane, host of a popular eponymous show in the vein of American Bandstand, which was an iconic symbol of popular music in Baltimore for a time.Ward, pg. 117 African American vocal music, specifically doo-wop, also established an early home in Baltimore. More recently, Baltimore was home to a number of well-known rock, pop, R&B;, punk, and hip hop performers. Classical music Philip Glass Most of the major musical organizations in Baltimore were founded by musicians who trained at the Peabody Institute's Conservatory of Music. These include Baltimore Choral Arts, Baltimore Opera Company (BOC), and the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra (BSO). These organizations all have excellent reputations and sponsor numerous performances throughout the year. Baltimore has produced a number of well-known modern composers of classical and art music, most famously including Philip Glass, a minimalist composer and Christopher Rouse, a Pulitzer winner. Glass grew up in the 1940s, working in his father's record store in East Baltimore, selling African American records, then known as race music. He was there exposed to Baltimore jazz and rhythm and blues. The first half of the twentieth century saw Baltimore hosting composers including George Frederick Boyle, Joseph Pache, Mark Fax, Adolph Weiss and Franz Bornschein. Though the Baltimore Opera Company can be traced back to the 1924 founding of the Martinet Opera School, the direct antecedent of the Company was founded in 1950, with Rosa Ponselle, a well-known soprano, as artistic director. In the following decade the Company modernized, receiving new funding from, among other sources, the Ford Foundation, which led to professionalization and the hiring of a full-time production manager and the stabilization on a program consisting of three operas every season; this schedule has since been expanded to four performances. In 1976, the Company commissioned In√™s de Castro for the American Bicentennial, composed by Thomas Pasatieri with a libretto by Bernard Stambler; the opera's debut was a great success and an historic moment for American opera. The Baltimore Symphony Orchestra of the 19th century had floundered in 1899, was replaced by a new orchestra organized by the Florestan Club, which included author H. L. Mencken; the Club ensured that the orchestra would be the first municipally funded company in the country. The reformed Baltimore Symphony Orchestra began in 1916, under the leadership of Gustav Strube, who conducted the orchestra until 1930. In 1942, the orchestra was reorganized as a private institution, led by Reginald Stewart, director of both the Orchestra and the Peabody, who arranged for Orchestra members to receive faculty appointments at the Peabody Conservatory, which helped attract new talent. The Orchestra claims that Joseph Meyerhoff, President of the Orchestra beginning in 1965, and his music director, Sergiu Comissiona began the modern history of the BSO and \\"ensured the creation of an institution, which has become the undisputed leader of the arts community throughout the State of Maryland\\". Meyerhoff and Comissiona established regular performances and a more professional atmosphere for the Orchestra. Under the next music director, David Zinman, the Orchestra recorded for major record labels, and went on several international tours, becoming the first Orchestra to tour in the Soviet bloc. The Baltimore Chamber Music Society, founded by Hugo Weisgall and Rudolph Rothschild in 1950, has commissioned a number of renowned works and is known for a series of controversial concerts featuring mostly 20th- century composers. The Baltimore Women's String Symphony Orchestra was led by Stephen Deak and Wolfgang Martin from 1936 to 1940, a time when women were barred from the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, though they were allowed in the Baltimore Colored Symphony Orchestra. In the early 20th century, Baltimore was home to several African American classically oriented music institutions which drew on a rich tradition of symphonic music, chamber concerts, oratorios, documented in large part by the Baltimore Afro-American, a local periodical. Inspired by A. Jack Thomas, who had been appointed conductor of the city's municipally supported African American performance groups, Charles L. Harris led the Baltimore Colored Chorus and Symphony Orchestra from 1929 to 1939, when a strike led to the company's dissolution. Thomas had been one of the first black bandleaders in the U.S. Army, was director of the music department at Morgan College, and was the founder of Baltimore's interracial Aeolian Institute for higher musical education. Charles L. Harris, as leader of the Baltimore Colored City Band, took his group to black neighborhoods across Baltimore, playing marches, waltzes and other music, then switch to jazz-like music with an upbeat tempo, meant for dancing. Some of Harris' musicians also played in early jazz clubs, though the musical establishment at the time did not readily accept the style. Fred Huber, Director of Municipal Music for Baltimore, exerted powerful control over the repertoire of these bands, and forbade jazz. T. Henderson Kerr, a prominent black bandleader, emphasized in his advertising that his group did not play jazz, while the prestigious Peabody Institute debated whether jazz was music at all. The Symphony Orchestra produced renowned pianist Ellis Larkins and cellist W. Llewellyn Wilson, also the music critic for the Afro-American. Harris eventually replaced Harris as conductor of the Orchestra and has since become a city musical fixture who is said to have, at one point, taught every single African American music teacher in Baltimore. After World War 2, William Marbury, then Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Peabody Institute, began the process of integrating that institution, which had denied entrance to several well- regarded African American performers based solely on their race, including Anne Brown and Todd Duncan, who had been the first black performer with the New York City Opera when he was forced to study with Frank Bibb, a member of the Peabody faculty, outside the Conservatory. The director of the Peabody soon ended segregation, both at the Conservatory and at the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, which was conducted by its first African American, A. Jack Thomas, at his request. The Peabody was officially integrated in 1949, with support from mayor Howard W. Jackson. Paul A. Brent, who graduated in 1953, was the first to matriculate, and was followed by Audrey Cyrus McCallum, who was the first to enter the Peabody Preparatory. Musical integration was a gradual process that lasted until at least 1966, when the unions for African American and white musicians merged to form the Musicians' Association of Metropolitan Baltimore. Baltimore is the hometown of African American classical opera tenor Steven Cole. African American popular music In the field of 20th- century popular music, Baltimore first was a major center for the development of East Coast ragtime, producing the legendary performer and composer Eubie Blake. Later, Baltimore became a hotspot for jazz, and a home for such legends in the field as Chick Webb and Billie Holiday. The city's jazz scene can be traced to the early part of the 20th century, when the style first spread across the country. Locally, Baltimore was home to a vibrant African American musical tradition, which included funereal processions, beginning with slow, mournful tunes and ending with lively ragtime numbers, very similar to the New Orleans music that gave rise to jazz.Floyd, pg. 83, Floyd cites a description by Eubie Blake, documented in Pennsylvania Avenue (often known simply as The Avenue) and Fremont Avenue were the major scenes for Baltimore's black musicians from the 1920s to the 1950s, and was an early home for Eubie Blake and Noble Sissle, among others. Baltimore had long been a major stop on the black touring circuit, and jazz musicians frequently played on Pennsylvania Avenue on the way to or from engagements in New York. Pennsylvania Avenue attracted African Americans from as far away as North Carolina, and was known for its vibrant entertainment and nightlife, as well as a more seedy side, home to prostitution, violence, ragtime and jazz, which were perceived as unsavory. The single most important venue for outside acts was the Royal Theatre, which was one of the finest African American theaters in the country when it was opened as the Douglass Theater, and was part of the popular performing circuit that included the Earle in Philadelphia, the Howard in Washington, D.C., the Regal in Chicago and the Apollo Theater in New York; like the Apollo, the audience at the Royal Theater was known for cruelly receiving those performers who didn't live up to their standards.Bird, pp 210‚Äì211, Bird notes that even hometown girl Billie Holiday got booed, and that the Royal Theatre was \\"reputedly even tougher than the cold-hearted Apollo\\", and quotes an unidentified Baltimorean as claiming that the audience \\"would throw anything\\".Ward, pg. 94 Music venues were segregated, though not without resistance - a 1910 tour featuring Bert Williams resulted in an African American boycott of a segregated theater, hoping the threat of lost business from the popular show would cause a change in policy. Pennsylvania Avenue was also a center for black cultural and economic life in Baltimore, and was home to numerous schools, theaters, churches and other landmarks. The street's nightclubs and other entertainment venues were most significant however, including the Penn Hotel, the first African American-owned hotel in Baltimore (built in 1921). Even the local bars and other establishments that didn't feature live music as a major feature generally had a solo pianist or organist. The first local bar to specialize in jazz was Club Tijuana. Major music venues at this time included Ike Dixon's Comedy Club, Skateland, Gamby's, Wendall's Tavern, The New Albert Dreamland, the Ritz, and most importantly, the Sphinx Club.Bird, pg. 210 The Sphinx Club became one of the first minority-owned nightclubs in the United States when it opened in 1946, founded by Charles Phillip Tilghman, a local businessman.Bird, pg. 211 The Baltimore Afro-American was a prominent African American periodical based in Baltimore in the early-to-mid-20th century, and the city was home to other black music media. Radio figures of importance included Chuck Richards on WBAL.Ward, pg. 52 =Eubie Blake and Noble Sissle= Baltimore's Eubie Blake was one of the most prominent ragtime musicians on the East Coast in the early 20th century, and was known for a unique style of piano-playing that eventually became the basis for stride, a style perfected during World War I in Harlem. Blake was the most well known figure in the local scene, and helped make Baltimore one of the ragtime centers of the East Coast, along with Philadelphia and Washington, D.C.Floyd, pg. 74, Floyd notes that St. Louis and Sedalia were the Midwestern centers, and New Orleans the center of ragtime in the South He then joined a medicine show, performing throughout Maryland and Pennsylvania before moving to New York in 1902 to play at the Academy of Music there. Returning to Baltimore, Blake played at The Saloon, a venue owned by Alfred Greenfield patronized by \\"colorful characters and 'working' girls\\"; The Saloon was the basis for his well-known \\"Corner of Chestnut and Low\\". He then played at Annie Gilly's sporting house, another rough establishment, before becoming well known enough to play throughout the city and win a number of national piano concerts. In 1915, Blake was hired to work at Riverview Park, with Noble Sissle, a singer, whom Blake approached about a songwriting partnership. Their first collaboration was \\"It's All Your Fault\\", premiered by Sophie Tucker at the Maryland Theater. Their success grew quickly, and they soon had numerous songs performed across the country, including on Broadway, most famously \\"Baltimore Buzz\\", \\"Gypsy Blues\\" and \\"Love Will Find a Way\\". In 1921, however, the duo received their greatest acclaim with the musical Shuffle Along, the first piece to bring African American jazz and humor to Broadway. The widespread acclaim for Shuffle Along led to changes in the theatre industry nationwide, producing demand for African American performers and leading to newly integrated theatrical companies across the country. When Shuffle Along came to Baltimore's Ford's Theater, Blake struggled to reserve a seat for his mother, because Ford's remained strictly segregated by race. =Jazz= Noble Sissle Baltimore had developed a local jazz scene by 1917, when the local black periodical, the Baltimore Afro-American noted its popularity in some areas. Two years later, black bandleader T. Henderson Kerr boasted that his act included \\"no jazz, no shaky music, no vulgar or suggestive dancing\\". Local jazz performers played on Baltimore Street, in an area known as The Block, located between Calvert and Gay Streets. Jazz audiences flocked to music venues in the area and elsewhere, such as the amusement parks around Baltimore; some of the more prominent venues included the Richmond Market Armory, the Old Fifth Regiment Armory, the Pythian Castle Hall and the Galilean Fisherman Hall. By the 1930s, however, The Ritz was the largest club on Pennsylvania Avenue, and was home to Sammy Louis' band, who toured to great acclaim throughout the region. The first group in Baltimore to self-apply the jazz label was led by John Ridgely, and known as either the John Ridgely Jazzers or the Ridgely 400 Society Jazz Band, which included pianist Rivers Chambers. Ridgely organized the band in 1917, and they played daily at the Maryland Theater in the 1920s. The two most popular of the early jazz performers in Baltimore, however, were Ernest Purviance and Joseph T. H. Rochester, who worked together, as the Drexel Ragtime Syncopators, starting a dance fad known as the \\"Shimme She Wabble She\\". As the Drexel Jazz Syncopators, they remained popular into the 1920s. The Royal Theatre was the most important jazz venue in Baltimore for much of the 20th century, and produced one of the city's musical leaders in Rivers Chambers, who led the Royal's band from 1930 to 1937. Chambers was a multi-instrumentalist who founded the Rivers Chambers Orchestra after leaving The Royal, and became a \\"favorite of Maryland's high society\\". As bandleader of The Royal, Chambers was succeeded by the classically trained Tracy McCleary, whose band, the Royal Men of Rhythm, included Charlie Parker at one point. Many of The Royal's band members would join with touring acts when they came through Baltimore; many had day jobs in the defense industry during World War 2, including McCleary himself. The shortage of musicians during the war led to a relaxation in some aspects of segregation, including in The Royal's band, which began hiring white musicians soon after the war. McCleary would be The Royal's last conductor, however, while Chambers' orchestra became a fixture in Baltimore, and came to include as many as thirty musicians, who would sometimes divide into smaller groups for performances. Chambers had collected many musicians from around the country, like Tee Loggins from Louisiana. Other performers with his Orchestra included trumpeter Roy McCoy, saxophonist Elmer Addison and guitarist Buster Brown, who was responsible for the Orchestra's most characteristic song, \\"They Cut Down That Old Pine Tree\\", which the Rivers Chambers Orchestra would continue to play for more than fifty years. Cab Calloway Baltimore's early jazz pioneers included Blanche Calloway, one of the first female jazz bandleaders in the United States, and sister to jazz legend Cab Calloway. Both the Calloways, like many of Baltimore's prominent black musicians, studied at Frederick Douglass High School with William Llewellyn Wilson, himself a renowned performer and conductor for the first African American symphony in Baltimore. Baltimore was also home to Chick Webb, one of jazz's most heralded drummers, who became a musical star despite being born hunchbacked and crippled at the age of five years.Bird, pp 212‚Äì213 Later Baltimoreans in jazz include Elmer Snowden, and Ethel Ennis.Bird, pp 208‚Äì209 After Pennsylvania Avenue declined in the 1950s, Baltimore's jazz scene changed. The Left Bank Jazz Society, an organization dedicated to promoting live jazz, began holding a weekly series of concerts in 1965, featuring the biggest names in the field, including Duke Ellington and John Coltrane. The tapes from these recordings became legendary within the jazz aficionados, but they did not begin to be released until 2000, due to legal complications.Bird, pg. 213 Ellery Eskelin Baltimore is known for jazz saxophonists, having produced recent performers like Antonio Hart, Ellery Eskelin, Gary Bartz, Mark Gross, Harold Adams, Gary Thomas and Ron Diehl. The city's style combines the experimental and intellectual jazz of Philadelphia and elsewhere in the north with a more emotive and freeform Southern tradition. The earliest well-known Baltimore saxophonists include Arnold Sterling, Whit Williams, Andy Ennis, Brad Collins, Carlos Johnson, Vernon H. Wolst, Jr.; the most famous, however, was Mickey Fields. Fields got his start with a jump blues band, The Tilters, in the early 1950s, and his saxophone-playing became the most prominent part of the band's style. Despite a national reputation and opportunities, Fields refused to perform outside the region and remains a local legend. In the 1960s, the Hammond B-3 organ became a critical part of the Baltimore jazz scene, led by virtuoso Jimmy Smith. The Left Bank Jazz Society also played a major role locally, hosting concerts and promoting performers. The popularity of jazz, however, declined greatly by the beginning of the 20th century, with an aging and shrinking audience, though the city continued producing local performers and hosting a vibrant jazz scene. =Doo wop= Baltimore was home to a major doo wop scene in the middle of the 20th century, which began with The Orioles, who are considered one of the first doo wop groups to record commercially. By the 1950s, Baltimore was home to numerous African American vocal groups, and talent scouts scoured the city for the next big stars. Many bands emerged from the city, including The Cardinals and The Plants. Some doo wop groups were connected with street gangs, and some members were active in both scenes, such as Johnny Page of The Marylanders. Competitive music and dance was a part of African American street gang culture, and with the success of some local groups, pressure mounted, leading to territorial rivalries among performers. Pennsylvania Avenue served as a rough boundary between East and West Baltimore, with the East producing The Swallows and The Cardinals, as well as The Sonnets, The Jollyjacks, The Honey Boys, The Magictones and The Blentones, while the West was home to The Orioles and The Plants, as well as The Twilighters and The Four Buddies.Ward, pg. 63 It was The Orioles, however, who first developed the city's vocal harmony sound. Originally known as The Vibra-Naires, The Orioles were led by Sonny Til when they recorded \\"It's Too Soon to Know\\", their first hit and a song that is considered the first doo wop recording of any kind. Doo wop would go on to have a formative influence on the development of rock and roll, and The Orioles can be considered the earliest rock and roll band as a result. The Orioles would continue recording until 1954, launching hits like \\"In the Chapel in the Moonlight\\", \\"Tell Me So\\" and \\"Crying in the Chapel\\". =Soul= Baltimore is less well known for its soul music than other major African-American urban areas, such as Philadelphia. However, it was home to a number of soul record labels in the 1960s and 1970s, including Ru-Jac (born 1963), whose artists included Joe Quarterman, Arthur Conley, Gene & Eddie, Winfield Parker, The Caressors, Jessie Crawford, The Dynamic Corvettes and Fred Martin.http://www.dcsoulrecordings.com/index.php?c=Baltimore&s;=recordlabelshttp://www.soulfulkindamusic.net/rujac.htmhttp://www.sirshambling.com/artists/G/gene_&_eddie.htm Soul venues in Baltimore in that period included The Royal and Carr's beach in Annapolis, one of the few beaches black people could use.http://www.raresoulforum.co.uk/index.php?showtopic=13360 Punk, rock, metal and the modern scene Though they rose to prominence in Boston and New York City respectively, new wave musicians Ric Ocasek and David Byrne are both natives of the Baltimore area. Frank Zappa, Tori Amos, Cass Elliot (The Mamas & the Papas), and Adam Duritz (Counting Crows vocalist) are also from Baltimore. Notable Baltimore-area rock acts from the 1970s and 1980s include Crack The Sky, The Ravyns, Kix, Face Dancer, Jamie LaRitz, and DC Star. Also, Epic recording Artist Tony Sciuto \\"Island Nights\\" who was also a member of Australia's Little River Band, Player and ABC Fullhouse's (Jesse and the Rippers) was raised in Medfield Heights (Hampden)area. Sciuto also has written songs for Tina Turner, Don Johnson, B.J Thomas and more. Baltimore's hardcore punk scene has been overshadowed by that of Washington, D.C., but included locally renowned bands like Law & Order, Bollocks, OTR, and Fear of God; many of these bands played at bars like the Marble Bar, Terminal 406 and the illegal space Jules' Loft, which author Steven Blush described as the \\"apex of the Baltimore (hardcore) scene\\" in 1983 and 1984. The 1980s also saw the development of a local new wave scene led by the bands Ebeneezer & the Bludgeons, The Accused / Mission / When Thunder Comes, Thee Katatonix, The Vamps, AR-15, Alter Legion, and Null Set. Later in the decade, emo bands like Reptile House and Grey March had some success and recorded with Ian MacKaye in DC. Some early Baltimore punk musicians moved on to other local bands by the end of the 1990s, while local mainstays Lungfish and Fascist Fascist becoming regionally prominent. The Urbanite magazine has identified several major trends in local Baltimorean music, including the rise of psychedelic-folk singer-songwriters like Entrance and the house/hip hop dance fusion called Baltimore club, pioneered by DJs like Rod Lee. More recently, Baltimore's modern music scene has produced performers like Jason Dove, Cass McCombs, Ponytail, Animal Collective, Spank Rock, Rye Rye, Double Dagger, Roomrunner, Mary Prankster, Beach House, Lower Dens, Future Islands, Wye Oak, The Seldon Plan, Dan Deacon, Ed Schrader's Music Beat, Sick Wespons, The Revelevens, Witch Hat, Dope Body, Rapdragons, and Adventure, many of whom are associated with the New Weird America movement, and thus is the city itself. In 2009, Baltimore produced its own indigenous rock opera theatrical company, the all- volunteer Baltimore Rock Opera Society, which operates out of Charles Village. The group has so far put on two rock operas, one in 2009 and the other in 2011. They both have featured original scores. Media and organizations Baltimore's indigenous music media includes The City Paper, The Baltimore Sun, and Music Monthly, which frequently advertise local music shows and other events. The Baltimore Blues Society also distributes one of the more well renowned blues periodicals in the country.Bird, pg. 218 The Baltimore Afro- American, a local periodical, was one of the most important media in 20th- century Baltimore, and documented much of that city's African American musical life. Recently, a number of new media sites have risen to prominence including Aural States (Best Local Music Blog 2008),http://www.citypaper.com/bob/story.asp?id=16671 Government Names, Mobtown Shank and Beatbots (Best Online Arts Community 2007).http://www.citypaper.com/bob/story.asp?id=14499 Baltimore is home to a number of non-profit music organization, most famously including the Left Bank Jazz Society, which hosts concerts and otherwise promotes jazz in Baltimore. Another organization to grace its way into the Baltimore scene is Vivre Musicale. The latter organization's mission is to give young artists performance opportunities in and out of Baltimore. These non-profits play a greater role in the city's musical life than similar organization do in most other American cities.Bird, pg. 214 The organization Jazz in Cool Places also works within that genre, presenting performers in architecturally significant locations, such as in a club full of Tiffany windows. The Society for the Preservation of American Roots Music also puts on jazz and blues concerts at its Roots Cafe.Bird, pg. 217 Venues Fell's Point is an area home to many nightclubs and other music venues. Many of Baltimore's nightclubs and other local music venues are in Fells Point and Federal Hill. One music field guide points to Fell's Point's Cat's Eye Pub, Full Moon Saloon, Fletcher's Bar, and Bertha's as particularly notable, in addition to a number of others, most famously including the Sportsmen's Lounge, which was a major jazz venue in the 1960s, when it was owned by football player Lenny Moore.Bird, pp 215‚Äì216 Many of the most legendary music venues in Baltimore have been shut down, including most of the shops, churches, bars and other destinations on the legendary Pennsylvania Avenue, center for the city's jazz scene. The Royal Theater, once one of the premiere destinations for African American performers on the East Coast, is marked only by a simple plaque, the theater itself having been demolished in 1971. A statue of Billie Holiday remains on Pennsylvania Avenue, however, between Lafayette and Lanvale, with a plaque that reads I don't think I'm singing. I feel like I am playing a horn. I try to improvise. What comes out is what I feel.Bird, pg. 212 There are six major concert halls in Baltimore. The Lyric Opera House is modeled after the Concertgebouw, in Amsterdam, and was reopened after several years of renovations in 1982, the same year the Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall opened. Designed by Pietro Belluschi, The Meyerhoff Symphony Hall is a permanent home for the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. Belluschi also designed the Kraushaar Auditorium at Goucher College, which opened in 1962. The Joseph and Rebecca Meyerhoff Auditorium, located at the Baltimore Museum of Art, also opened in 1982, and hosts concerts by the Baltimore Chamber Music Society. Johns Hopkins University's Shriver Hall and the Peabody's Miriam A. Friedberg are also important concert venues, the latter being the oldest still in use. Education Peabody Institute, c. 1902 In the public school system of Baltimore city, music education is a part of each grade level to high school, at which point it becomes optional. Beginning in first grade, or approximately six years old, Baltimore students begin to learn about melody, harmony and rhythm, and are taught to echo short melodic and rhythmic patterns. They also begin to learn about different musical instruments and distinguish between different kinds of sounds and types of songs.Learning at Home: What Your Child Will Learn in 1st Grade As students progress through the grades, teachers go into more detail and require more proficiency in elementary musical techniques. Students perform rounds in second grade, for example,Learning at Home: What Your Child Will Learn in 2nd Grade while movement (i.e. dance) enters the curriculum in third grade.Learning at Home: What Your Child Will Learn in 3rd Grade Beginning in middle school in the sixth grade, students are taught to make mature aesthetic judgements, and to understand and respond to a variety of forms of music.Learning at Home: What Your Child Will Learn in 6th Grade In high school, students may choose to take courses in instrumentation or singing, and may be exposed to music in other areas of the curriculum, such as in theater or drama classes. Public school instruction in music in Baltimore began in 1843. Prior to that, itinerant and professional singing masters were the dominant form of formal music education in the state. Music institutions like the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra sometimes have programs aimed at youth education, and other organizations have a similar focus. The Eubie Blake Center exists to promote African American culture, and music, to both youth and adults, through dance classes for all age groups, workshops, clinics, seminars and other programs. =Higher education= Baltimore's most famous institute of higher music education is the Peabody Institute's Conservatory of Music, founded in 1857 though instruction did not begin until 1868. The original grant from George Peabody funded an Academy of Music, which became the Conservatory in 1872. Lucien Southard was the first director of the Conservatory. In 1977, the Conservatory became affiliated with Johns Hopkins University. The Baltimore region is home to other institutions of musical education, including Towson University, Goucher College, and Morgan State University, each of which both instruct and present concerts, Morgan State University, which offers Bachelor of Fine Arts and Master of Arts degrees in music, and Bowie State University, which offers undergraduate programs in music and music technology. The Arthur Friedham Library collects primary sources relating to music in Baltimore, as do the archives maintained by the Peabody and the Maryland Historical Society. Johns Hopkins University is home to the Milton S. Eisenhower Library, whose Lester S. Levy Collection is one of the most important collections of American sheet music in the country, and contains more than 40,000 pieces, including original printings of works by Carrie Jacobs-Bond such as \\"A Perfect Day\\" (song).

When completed In 1872, it became the longest deep-water pier between Los Angeles and San Francisco. Named for its builder, local lumberman John P. Stearns, the wharf served the passenger and freight shipping needs of California's South Coast for over a quarter century. Before the wharf, passengers and cargo had to be rowed ashore through the breakers and kelp. Despite the great convenience offered by the wharf, Santa Barbara remained a fair-weather harbor with an acute need for a breakwater. During December 1878, storms destroyed and washed away more than 1,000 feet of the wharf. Despite these losses, it would be another 52 years before Santa Barbara got its needed breakwater.Baker, Gayle, Santa Barbara, HarborTown Histories, Santa Barbara, CA, 2003, p. 53-54. (print) 9780987903815 (on-line) When the railroad reached Santa Barbara in 1877, Stearns added another spur to the wharf, providing a necessary transport link to his lumberyard and the nearby Southern Pacific Depot. The spur was damaged by severe storms in the early 20th century and was finally abandoned in 1923. The Harbor Restaurant was built on the wharf in 1941, marking an end to the shipping and transportation era of the 19th century. The restaurant proved to be the economic backbone of the wharf. Since its beginning, Stearns Wharf has had several natural and economic disasters, from the big earthquake in 1925 to a fire in 1973 which caused its closing. The wharf stayed closed for six years until restorations were completed in 1981. Another fire in the winter of 1998 devastated the last hundred and fifty feet of the wharf, including Moby Dick Restaurant.

Early music In the 1710s in the colonial United States, a number of singing schools arose, beginning in New England and spreading into Maryland by 1764, beginning in Annapolis. These singing schools met in the evenings, with a singing master leading the education of both youth and adults in the basics of musical performance, including note-reading and part-singing, and the particulars of Christian hymns. Most singing masters were educated only in other singing schools, and not in any sort of formal music education. Many singing masters were itinerant travelers. Though Annapolis was the first town in Maryland to be home to a singing school, they became common, first in Baltimore and then throughout the state, after the Revolutionary War. The first was at St. Anne's Anglican Church in Annapolis, in 1764, led by singing master Phillip Williams, who taught psalmody in four parts. Though Williams, being itinerant, left Annapolis after only one year, he was replaced by a new singing master, Hugh Maguire, the following year. After the Revolutionary War, singing school activities began diminishing throughout Maryland, including Annapolis. The only noted singing master during this time was Alexander Gray, in 1786, and possibly for some time thereafter. =Tuesday Club= Caricature featuring the Tuesday Club's comic orchestra from The history of the ancient and honorable Tuesday club, ca 1755. From the collection at the John Work Garrett Library. During the colonial era, Annapolis was one of the larger cities in North America, and was home to an organization called the Tuesday Club, which documented musical activity in the city in more detail than any other record of its kind. The club was founded in 1745 by Alexander Hamilton in imitation of similar clubs in Edinburgh, specifically the Whin-Bush Club. Music was not initially the major focus of the group, but it soon came to specialize in musical activities at biweekly meetings known as sederunts. Both original vocal and instrumental material and published compositions were a part of the Tuesday Club's repertoire, including Scottish and English folksongs, and English theatrical pieces. Among the club's members was Jonas Green, printer of the Maryland Gazette and publisher of music books, and Thomas Bacon, the club's most renowned composer whose works were very much in the European model. No compositions from the club gained significant acclaim outside of the city. The music of the Tuesday Club was expressly and purposely European in character, as the members wished to emulate the acknowledged masters of the Western classical music tradition. However, unlike classical music, performances were recreational in nature rather than artistic, the music composed by members of the Club being entirely casual, and probably never intended for outside consumption. The corpus of the club's output constitutes the earliest known American secular music. Instrumentation included the French horn, flute, cello, viola and harpsichord. Popular music The band Good Charlotte, originally from nearby Waldorf, moved to Annapolis in 1998 In the 1980s, Annapolis was home to two of the most important early emo bands, Moss Icon and The Hated, both of whom recorded for the prominent local Vermin Scum record label. Vermin Scum also released records by Black Dice, Breathing Walker and the Universal Order of Armageddon. Annapolis has also been home to the funk rock band Jimmie's Chicken Shack, singer Eva Cassidy and the band Good Charlotte. InstitutionsNaval Academy= The United States Naval Academy Band, the longest-lasting music group in the United States Navy and the third-oldest active-duty military band in the country, was founded in 1852, though the history of instrumental music at the Academy can be traced back to its founding in 1852. John Jarvis, a drummer, and William Bealer, a fifer, are the best-remembered servicemen from the Band's early years, though the first Marine Musicians to serve were named Tommy Diggins and William Hoeke. Musicians with the band performed calls, like tattoo and reveille. When the Band was officially funded in 1852, bandmaster and performer John Philip Pfeiffer selected the first musicians, who performed their first concert in 1853 for the Secretary of the Navy. During the Civil War, the Band's musicians were deployed, while the Academy was temporarily transferred to Newport, Rhode Island, returning in 1865. At the end of the War, band members were transferred to the civil personnel of the Academy, as opposed to drawing pay as a member of the Navy. With this shift, performers' pay decreased, and the difference was made up by charging midshipmen and officers at the Academy a monthly fee. Soon after, Superintendent David Dixon Porter modernized and professionalized the Band, expanding its size and providing attractive uniforms. In the 1880s, woodwind instruments were added to the Band, which had previously been exclusively brass; new instruments included clarinets, oboes and piccolos. The youngest bandmaster in the organization's history, Charles Adams Zimmerman, took office in 1887, and is known for establishing a theatrical group and becoming very popular among the cadets at the Academy. David Dixon Porter, Superintendent of the Academy, modernized the Band. In 1894, the uniform of the United States Marines Corp Band was prescribed for the Naval Academy Band, and wore that uniform until 1925. Zimmerman remained the bandmaster even after being offered the more prestigious position with the Marine Corps Band in 1897, and is perhaps best known for composing \\"Anchors Aweigh\\" in 1907, intending it to be an inspiring and timeless piece of music that could be used as a football marching song. Under Zimmerman's successor, Adolph Torovsky, the Academy Band made its first commercial recording, in 1920, using Zimmerman's \\"Anchors' Aweigh\\", and one of Torovsky's own pieces, \\"March of the Middies\\". In 1939, the Band began performing on Maryland radio stations and represented that state at the World Fair, while the director, Lieutenant Sima, composed the \\"Victory March\\", one of the most well-known and popular pieces produced at the Academy. Under Alexander Cecil Morris in the middle of the 20th century, the Academy Band performed on television for the first time, established a weekly radio show and acquired entirely new instruments and facilities. In the 1970s, under bandmaster Ned E. Muffley integrated women into the Naval Academy's music program, while the Academy's first rock band, Tidal Wave, also saw some national success. His successor, William J. Phillips, established lush, thematic performances featuring largely original compositions; the changes attracted new audiences and the Academy Band became internationally renowned. In 1973, Gayle Slayter was recruited for the Band, becoming known as the \\"Naval Academy's First Lady of Song\\" over the course of her twenty-year career. The Naval Academy Band also encompasses a brass quintet, wind quintet, marching band and other units. The Academy is also home to a number of other noted music groups. =Naval Academy Department of Musical Activities= Over the course of more than a century, the Naval Academy Music Department has had just four civilian musical directors. J.W. Crosley, who in 1923 composed the music to Navy Blue and Gold, the Naval Academy alma mater, was followed in 1943 as Organist/Choirmaster by Donald C. Gilley who established the hugely popular annual performance of Handel‚Äôs Messiah. In 1972, Dr. John Barry Talley took over the reins as Director of Musical Activities, a position he held until his retirement in 2006. Under Dr. Talley‚Äôs leadership, the Academy‚Äôs music program grew to international stature. Talley was succeeded by Dr. Aaron Smith. The United States Naval Academy Department of Musical Activities involves over one thousand midshipmen (students) who participate in a number of ensembles: Men‚Äôs and Women‚Äôs Glee Clubs, three Chapel Choirs, the Drum and Bugle Corps, Pipes and Drums ensemble, Symphony Orchestra, a music theatre program, and several smaller ensembles. Many of these groups tour extensively throughout America and abroad, performing in major concert halls and with professional symphony orchestras. They have been featured on ‚ÄúThe Today Show,‚Äù ‚ÄúGood Morning America,‚Äù ‚ÄúCBS Morning Show,‚Äù and have appeared in several nationally televised broadcasts of the ‚ÄúKennedy Center Honors,‚Äù and a 20-year run on NBC/TNT‚Äôs ‚ÄúChristmas in Washington.‚Äù The Naval Academy also hosts a Distinguished Artists Series that presents world-class performers to the Brigade of Midshipmen and the general public on the stage of Alumni Hall. Among the most popular presentations in Annapolis are the annual Halloween Organ Concert, featuring Chapel Organist Monte Maxwell and a cast of one hundred midshipmen, the Christmas Messiah program and the spring Glee Club musical, a fully staged and costumed Broadway musical; all these events draw capacity audiences exceeding 4000 patrons. The Naval Academy Chapel Organ is one of the country's major instruments. Monte Maxwell serves as principal chapel organist. He was preceded by organist James A. Dale. =Annapolis Chorale= The Annapolis Chorale is a nonprofit organization whose programs include a Chamber Chorus, Chamber Orchestra and the Annapolis Youth Chorus; programs include both Western classical and semi-classical music, as well as educational and scholarship initiatives. The Chorale was founded in 1974 by James A. Dale, Assistant Director of Musical Activities at the United States Naval Academy. From 1976 to 1978, Mark Tardue led the Chorale to new growth and organized a 1977 sold-out concert that became critically acclaimed and greatly assisted the Chorale's reputation. J. Ernest Green was selected as music director and conductor in 1984, and he serves as of 2008, having becoming the longest-serving person in that position in the organization's history. =Annapolis Symphony Orchestra= The Annapolis Symphony Orchestra, founded in 1962, is a well-known organization that has hosted guests like Cuban violinist Guillermo Perch and Charlie Byrd; the Annapolis Orchestra inspired composer David Ott to create the Annapolis Overture, which debuted in 1995. =The Sons of the Severn= The Sons of the Severn is an award-winning, non-profit men's choral ensemble founded in Annapolis in 1949. The chorus represents the Anne Arundel County, MD Chapter of the Barbershop Harmony Society (SPEBSQSA, Inc), and won the 2010 Western Division Chorus Championship in the Society's Mid-Atlantic District. The Sons of the Severn chorus performs all year throughout Annapolis, Anne Arundel County, and the surrounding areas. Notable venues include the Maryland Statehouse, Oriole Park at Camden Yards, Loews Annapolis Hotel, and Annapolis City Hall. T. J. Barranger has served as the group's director since February 2005, and has directed the chorus to six consecutive appearances at the Mid-Atlantic District chorus finals competition. The Sons of the Severn chorus is an active supporter of charitable endeavors in Anne Arundel County, MD, including the North County Emergency Outreach Network, and music education programs in Anne Arundel County high schools. =Other institutions= Annapolis also home to the Annapolis Opera and the Ballet Theatre of Maryland. The Annapolis Opera was founded in 1972, and hosts year-round musical programs and contests. The Annapolis Maritime Museum sponsors the Chesapeake Music Institute, an organization founded to promote traditional music associated with the Chesapeake Bay. Venues and festivals In modern Annapolis, three music venues are notable for blues and jazz, namely the King of France Tavern in the Maryland Inn and the Ebb Tide near the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. The Maryland Hall for the Creative Arts is another major local venue, hosting numerous renowned performing groups throughout the year. It was founded in 1979. On November 1, 1997 Rams Head On Stage hosted Livingston Taylor, the first concert of nearly 8,000 shows and counting for the venue. In their 20 years, Rams Head has entertained over 1.5 million concert goers and continues to bring national entertainers to the city of Annapolis, hosting more than 400 shows a year. In 2012, Rams Head On Stage was named the Top Club Under 500 Seats in the World by Pollstar Magazine. Rams Head also produced the Silopanna Music Festival in 2014 featuring artists The Flaming Lips, Dashboard Confessional, Matt & Kim, and Eric Hutchinson. The Annapolis Music Fest was first held in June 2002, which hosts both touring and local bands in a variety of styles of rock and hip hop. Founded in 1997 by James Borchelt, Eastport-A- Rockin' is an Annapolis music festival featuring local and national artists on 3 stages. Traditionally held the last weekend of June on the grounds of the Annapolis Maritime Museum, it is the longest current running music festival within the city, with previous performers including Good Charlotte and Jimmie's Chicken Shack.http://www.eastportarockin.com See also *Music of Maryland *List of Maryland music groups ReferencesFurther reading * * Annapolis Category:Annapolis, Maryland Annapolis ","title":"Music of Annapolis"},{"id":"2753112","text":"EGPA may refer to: * ICAO airport code for the Kirkwall Airport * Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, otherwise known as Churg-Strauss syndrome.

Infant formula Coffee-Mate, a synthetic coffee whitener made for use in coffee A milk substitute is one term used to describe plant milk in relation to mammalian milk. Other terms include non-dairy beverage, nut milk, and alternative milk. Milk substitutes for non-infant consumption take two forms: plant milks, which are liquids made from plants and may be home-made or commercially produced, and coffee creamers, synthetic products invented in the US in the 1900s specifically to replace dairy milk in coffee. Due to their composition, alternatives to dairy milk may have a longer shelf-life and may be able to withstand higher temperatures than dairy milk without spoiling. Some milk substitutes are marketed as being healthier than cow's milk due to being lower in saturated fat and (if entirely free of animal products) cholesterol-free. When milk analogues lack the vitamins or dietary minerals present in dairy milk (such as vitamin B12 or calcium), they may be fortified.  History  Around the world, humans have traditionally consumed plant milks for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. In 2018, Tara McHugh in Food Technology Magazine wrote: \\"The word ‚Äúmilk‚Äù has been used since around 1200 AD to refer to plant juices.\\" The article also said: \\"Of all the plant-based milks, coconut milk has the longest tradition of use. It originated in India and Southeast Asia and has been used as both a drink and an ingredient for nutrition and ceremonial offerings. Soy milk also has a long history and was discovered in 1365 in China.\\" In 2018, Benjamin Kemper wrote in the Smithsonian Magazine: > Linguistically speaking, using ‚Äúmilk‚Äù to refer to ‚Äúthe white juice of > certain plants‚Äù (the second definition of milk in the Oxford American > Dictionary) has a history that dates back centuries. The Latin root word of > lettuce is lact, as in lactate, for its milky juice, which indicates that > even the Romans had a fluid definition for milk.

Fortification Humans may consume dairy milk for a variety of reasons, including tradition, availability and nutritional value (especially minerals like calcium, vitamins such as B12, and protein). plant-sourced substitutes for dairy milk may be expected to meet such standards, though there are no legal requirements for them to do so. This may result in additives being put into milk substitutes to compensate for the absence of certain vitamins, minerals and/or proteins. Infant formula, whether based on cow's milk, soy or rice, is usually fortified with iron and other dietary nutrients. Non-dairy milks Coconut milk is made by mixing water with the freshly grated white inside pulp of a ripe coconut. Though considered by some in the west as a substitute for dairy milk, coconut milk has been used as a traditional ingredient in Southeast Asian, South Asian, Caribbean, and northern South American cuisines for centuries, if not millennia. It is also a source of calcium and vitamins C, E, B1, B3, B5 and B6. Coconut milk is usually very high in fat and calories, but low in protein, which makes it a good substitute for cream, as it can be whipped up in a similar fashion to decorate baked goods or desserts. Almond milk Almond milk is produced from almonds by grinding almonds with water, then straining the pulp from the liquid. This procedure can be done at home. Almond milk is low in saturated fat and calories. Oat milk is a relatively recently developed plant-based milk substitute. Different preparations are available for either direct consumption or to use in coffee. Oat milk has a smooth oatmeal flavour and is often supplemented with calcium and vitamins to be a viable vegan mammalian milk replacement. Oat milk is marketed as an environment-friendly alternative to almond milk. Soy milk Soy milk is made from soybeans and contains about the same amount of protein as dairy milk. When enriched by the manufacturer, it may be a source of calcium and vitamin D and some B vitamins such as B12; however, this is not in all brands of soy milk. According to one study, soy protein may be a substitution for animal protein to prevent and control chronic kidney disease. Rice milk is mostly used for baking because of its sweet taste, but in case of a nut or soy allergy a grain milk processed from rice may be preferable. When fortified, this milk can be a source of calcium, vitamin B12, and vitamin D2. Peanut milk is made with peanuts. Hemp milk is made by grinding hemp seeds with water, which are then strained to yield a nutty creamy flavored milk. Hemp milk is naturally rich in protein and amino acids. In yeast-derived milk products, sugar is mixed with yeast and the resulting fermentation process creates the whey and casein proteins (which are identical to those found in milk). This is then combined with plant-based sugars, fats, and minerals to reproduce the milk, which can then be used like regular milk, including cheesemaking. Milk substitutes produced in this way do not require the use of animals and compared to regular milk production are more efficient, produce fewer greenhouse gases and utilize less land (as no animals need to be fed, medicated, impregnated, milked, and slaughtered when no longer productive).Perfect Day: Meet the startup that makes milk‚Äîwithout cowsCow Milk Without the Cow Is Coming to Change Food ForeverThis Startup Wants to Make Cow's Milk‚ÄîWithout Cows =Composition of plant milks= In the United States, dairy milk is required by federal law to contain a certain amount of vitamins A and D. However, there is no such requirement for milk substitutes. In Germany, milk substitutes tend to contain 30% milk powder, with the remaining 70% consisting of whey and cheaper vegetable extracts, especially palm oil and coconut oil. Lactose intolerance Dairy-free ice cream Lactose is the major sugar found in dairy milk. Lactose intolerance occurs when an individual is deficient in the enzyme lactase, which breaks down the lactose in the intestine. Bloating, cramps, constipation, or diarrhea may result when an individual who is lactose intolerant consumes a dairy product. Due to genetic differences, intolerance of lactose is more common globally than tolerance. Rates of lactose intolerance vary globally, from less than 10% in Northern Europe to as high as 95% in parts of Asia and Africa. In a modern Western context, food products are manufactured as dairy substitutes partly to cater to lactose intolerant individuals, including milk, yogurt, whipped topping and ice cream. In Asia and Africa, where rates of lactose intolerance are much higher than in the West and dairy production has been less predominant, many traditional analogues to dairy milk beverages exist, including amazake, douzhi, kunnu aya, kokkoh, poi and sikhye. =Lactose-free manufacturing= A lactose-free food, such as non-dairy ice cream, may require a different process during manufacturing. For example, traditional dairy ice cream is made with a combination of milk products that contain lactose, but non-dairy ice cream may be synthesized using hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated vegetable oil (coconut oil, palm kernel oil and soybean oil) along with emulsifier, protein, sweetener and water. Some not yet widely prevalent synthetic ice cream products are claimed to have a similar flavour and texture to traditional dairy ice cream.Doris E. Pitz. Lactose-Free Synthetic Ice Cream. United States Patent No: 2,643,90, February 17, 1987. http://patft.uspto.gov. Retrieved November 8, 2011. However many smaller scale, organic, gourmet or slow food focused non-dairy ice cream manufacturers create all their products using traditional, natural and only slightly altered methods. The preferred base for non dairy ice creams are often coconut milk or plant cream, due to the higher fat and lower water content preventing the formation of ice crystals. Infant formula Breast milk substitutes are available for infants if breast feeding is not an option. Infant formulas based on cow's milk, soy or rice can be a supplement to breast milk or a sole source of nutrition before solid food is introduced. Infant formula is usually fortified with dietary nutrients optimised for babies and toddlers, such as iron, to ensure survival, growth and health of the baby.Feeding baby infant formula.

He graduated in 1970 from Sidney Lanier High School in Montgomery, completed a bachelor's degree in history at Huntingdon College in Montgomery in 1976, and did graduate work in political science and public administration at Auburn University in Auburn. Wallace had two sons from his first marriage: George Corley Wallace IV and Robert Kelly Wallace. Wallace IV died on May 12, 2009, at the age of twenty-five, from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. In 2000, Wallace Jr. married the former Elizabeth Grimes Maynor and acquired two stepdaughters. Professional and political career From 1978 to 1987, Wallace worked at Troy University in Troy, Alabama. He was from 1978 to 1982 the director of financial aid and alumni affairs. From 1983 to 1987, he was vice president of development and alumni affairs. During part of the time he was at Troy, the faculty included Max Rafferty, former California Superintendent of Public Instruction, and former Governor John Malcolm Patterson, an intraparty opponent of both of his parents. In 1986, Wallace was elected Alabama State Treasurer, narrowly winning the Democratic Party primary and runoff over Jim Zeigler and facing no opposition in the general election. He was easily reelected in 1990. In 1992, midway through his second term, Wallace ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in , his family's home district, to succeed retiring 28-year Republican incumbent Bill Dickinson. He narrowly missed avoiding a runoff in the primary, but prevailed over state welfare commissioner Faye Baggiano, who had nearly toppled Dickinson in the 1990 election. Wallace was considered an early favorite in the general election, especially after his expected Republican opponent, State Senator Larry Dixon, lost his primary to Terry Everett, a newspaper publisher from the Wiregrass who had never run for office before. However, Wallace lost the election in an upset to Everett by just 3,571 votes, less than 1 percent. It is believed that Wallace's loss resulted from the shift of most of the district's African-American voters, particularly in Montgomery and Selma, to the 7th district, which had been reconfigured as a black-majority district after the 1990 census in accordance with the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In 1994, while wrapping up his second term as state treasurer, Wallace ran for lieutenant governor, but finished third to Don Siegelman and Ryan DeGraffenried Jr. (DeGraffenried's father, Ryan DeGraffenried Sr., was defeated in the 1962 Democratic gubernatorial runoff by Wallace's father). After leaving the treasurer's office, Wallace worked at the Center for Government and Public Affairs at Auburn University Montgomery. He switched affiliations to the GOP and was elected in 1998 to the Alabama Public Service Commission (Position 2), having defeated incumbent Democrat Charles B. Martin. He was reelected commissioner in 2002 but did not run again in 2006, when the Republicans nominated former state Representative Perry O. Hooper Jr., of Montgomery. Hooper defeated former state Senator John Amari of Trussville in the Republican primary but then lost the general election to Democrat Susan Parker. Wallace instead sought in 2006 the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor and entered a runoff election with Birmingham attorney Luther Strange. Wallace lost by ten points despite appearances on his behalf from U.S. Senator John McCain of Arizona. Strange, in turn, lost the general election to Democratic nominee Jim Folsom Jr. of Cullman, a son of former Governor Jim Folsom who had previously served as both lieutenant governor and governor. In 2010, Wallace ran in the Republican primary to reclaim his old office of state treasurer, but lost the nomination to banker Young Boozer by nearly thirty points. Controversy In June 2005 he opened up the first day of the annual national convention of the Council of Conservative Citizens (CofCC), a white nationalist organization. This was not Wallace's first interaction with the CofCC; he gave speeches to the CofCC once in 1998 and twice in 1999. He has also appeared as a guest on The Political Cesspool, a radio talk show that is affiliated with the Tennessee chapter of the CofCC.

The state was made up of this two distinct cultural regions ‚Äì Rayalaseema and Coastal Andhra. Andhra State was created in 1953 but it excluded a few Telugu-speaking areas in Hyderabad State. Andhra Pradesh became the first state in India constituted under the State Reorganisation Act of 1956. Creation of Andhra State Madras Province (South). In an effort to protect the interests of the Telugu people of Madras State, Potti Sreeramulu attempted to force the Madras state government to listen to public demands for the separation of Telugu-speaking districts (Rayalaseema and Coastal Andhra) from Madras State to form Andhra State. He went on a lengthy fast, and only stopped when Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru promised to form Andhra State. However, there was no movement on the issue for a long time. He started fasting again in Maharshi Bulusu Sambamurti's house in Madras on 19 October 1952. It started off without fanfare but steadily caught people's attention despite the disapproval of the fast by the Andhra INC committee. The government of the day, however, did not make a clear statement about the formation of a new state, despite several strikes and demonstrations by Telugu people. On the midnight of 15 December (i.e. early 16 December 1952), Sreeramulu died trying to achieve his objective at House No. 126, Royapethah High Road, Mylapore, Madras State; the house has been preserved as a monument by the state government.Ramachandra Guha. India After Gandhi: The History of the World's Largest Democracy Harper Perennial; Reprint edition (12 August 2008) In his death procession, people shouted slogans praising his sacrifice. When the procession reached Mount Road, thousands of people joined and raised slogans hailing Sreeramulu. Later, they went into a frenzy and resorted to destruction of public property. The news spread like wildfire and created an uproar among the people in far off places like Chirala, Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada, Rajahmundry, Eluru, Bhimavaram, Guntur, Tenali, Ongole and Nellore. Seven people were killed in clashes with police in Anakapalle and Vijayawada. The popular agitation continued for three to four days disrupting normal life in Madras and Andhra regions. On 19 December 1952, the Prime Minister of the country Jawaharlal Nehru made an announcement about formation of a separate state for the Telugu-speaking people of Madras State. The central government appointed K. N. Wanchoo, Chief Justice of the Rajasthan High Court, to look into issues related to formation of Andhra State. Parliament passed the Andhra State Act in September 1953. On 1 October 1953, 11 districts in the Telugu-speaking portion of Madras State became the new Andhra State with Kurnool as the capital. Tanguturi Prakasam Pantulu (also known as Andhra Kesari ‚Äì \\"The Lion of Andhra\\") became the first Chief Minister of the new state. Formation of this first \\"linguistic state\\" paved the way to creation of more and provided an opportunity for these states to develop independently, linguistically and economically, each of them having a state to support.http://www.sankalpindia.net/drupal/the-first-linguistic- state-andhra-pradesh-was-born  Districts of Andhra State  Hyderabad State in 1956 * Uttarandhra ** Srikakulam ** Vizianagaram ** Visakhapatnam * Coastal Andhra region ** East Godavari ** West Godavari ** Krishna ** Guntur ** Prakasam ** Nellore * Rayalaseema region ** Chittoor ** Kadapa ** Anantapur ** Kurnool Bhadrachalam and Nuguru Venkatapuram taluks of East Godavari district (part of coastal Andhra Pradesh), which are on the other side of the river Godavari, were merged into Khammam district on grounds of geographical contiguity and administrative viability. Earlier, Aswaraopeta was also part of West Godavari district and was added to Khammam district in 1959. Similarly, Munagala mandal was added to Nalgonda district and removed from Krishna district in 1959. Formation of Andhra Pradesh of new  Andhra State (yellow), which merged with Telangana (white) to form the State of Andhra Pradesh in 1956 On 1 November 1956 Andhra State and the Telangana region of Hyderabad State were merged to form the united Telugu-speaking State of Andhra Pradesh. Non-Telugu-speaking parts of Hyderabad State were merged with Bombay State and Karnataka State. Hyderabad State in 1956 (in yellowish green) After reorganisation in 1956, regions of the state west of the red and blue lines merged with Bombay and Mysore States, respectively, and the rest of the state (Telangana) was merged with Andhra State to form Andhra Pradesh State. =SRC (Fazal Ali Commission)= Paragraph 382 of the SRC report dated 30 September 1955 said, \\"opinion in Andhra is overwhelmingly in favour of the larger unit, public opinion in Telangana has still to crystallize itself. Important leaders of public opinion in Andhra themselves seem to appreciate that the unification of Telangana with Andhra, though desirable, should be based on a voluntary and willing association of the people and that it is primarily for the people of Telangana to take a decision about their future\\". While the Fazal Ali commission emphasises on the necessity and benefits Visalandhra, the report suggests that the process of merging may only be done after 5 years. In Paragraph 386, it states, \\"...for the present the Telangana area is to constitute into a separate State, which may be known as Hyderabad State with provision for its unification with Andhra after the general elections likely to be held in or about 1961, if by two thirds majority the legislature of the residency Hyderabad State expresses itself in favor of the such unification.‚Äù Paragraph 387 goes on to say that the advantage of this arrangement will be that while the objective of the unification of the Andhras will neither be blurred nor impeded during a period of five or six years, the two governments may have stabilised their administrative machinery and, if possible, also reviewed their land revenue systems etc., the object in view being the attainment of uniformity. The intervening period may incidentally provide an opportunity for allaying apprehensions and achieving the consensus of opinion necessary for a real union between the two States.s:India States Reorganisation Commission Report Telangana Andhra#The Case for Telangana From the content of Paragraph 387, the commission's main objective was to attain uniformity by achieving adequate administrative machinery and proper land review systems in the recently formed Andhra State and the new State of Hyderabad being formed and this duration could also be incidentally utilised for gaining consensus opinion for merger of the two states. In line with SRC opinion, the elected leaders of both states decided for immediate merger by achieving consensus by two thirds majority strength in both assemblies of these states. The Hyderabad chief minister, in his letter to the INC president, said Communist parties supported the merger for their political calculations. The Hyderabad PCC chief said the overwhelming majority of INC party members opposed the merger, that Communists were elected in special circumstances in 1951, that Visalandhra was not a political issue in 1951, and that the Assembly does not reflect the people's view on the issue. He also said 80% of INC delegates who were elected in 1955 opposed the merger. The government had to provide additional security for Communist leaders who supported the Visalandhra. In the Hyderabad Assembly, on 3 December 1955, 147 of 174 MLAs expressed their view. 103 (including Marathi and Kannada MLAs) supported the merger, 16 were neutral, and 29 opposed it. Among Telangana MLAs, 59 supported the merger and 25 opposed it. Out of 94 Telangana MLAs in the assembly, 36 were Communists (PDF), 40 were INC, 11 were Socialist party (SP), and 9 were independents. Voting did not take place on the resolution because Telangana proponents insisted on including the phrase \\"As per the wishes of people\\" in the resolution. To convince the leadership of Telangana to join the new state, an agreement was reached between the leaders of both sides. This came to be known as the Gentlemen's agreement. The agreement allowed the formation of the State of Andhra Pradesh in 1956, against the SRC's recommendations of waiting until 1961 to get the approval of 2/3 of Telangana State assembly after the 2 cycles of elections in Telangana State. Telangana and 1972 Jai Andhra movements The Telangana movement was started in 1969, demanding proper implementation of the Gentlemen's agreement, particularly the mulki rules. When the Supreme Court upheld the discriminatory mulki rules applicable among the people of a state, it spawned the 1972 Jai Andhra movement. This was a public agitation demanding a separate Andhra State. The movement dissipated after the central government repealed the mulki rules and introduced a new six point formula.  Creation of Telangana State  On 2 June 2014, Telangana State was separated back out of Andhra Pradesh and Kalvakuntla Chandrashekhar Rao better known and abbreviated as K.C.R. is the 1st and the current Chief Minister of Telangana, after the Telangana state got separated from United Andhra Pradesh.

Grigory Spiridov began his career in the Russian Navy in 1723. He was promoted to an officer rank in 1733. Spiridov had been commanding different ships of the Baltic Fleet since 1741. During the Seven Years' War of 1756-1763, he was in charge of a landing party of two thousand men when Peter Rumyantsev was laying siege to the fortress of Kolberg in Pomerania. In 1762, Spiridov was promoted to the rank of rear admiral and assigned to command a squadron for securing the contact with the Russian army in Prussia. In 1764, he was appointed commander of the port of Tallinn and then Kronstadt (1766). During the Russo-Turkish War of 1768-1774, Spiridov was in charge of a squadron, which would be sent from the Baltic Sea to the Mediterranean to assist the Greeks in their struggle against the Turks in the summer of 1769 (see Orlov Revolt and First Archipelago Expedition). In early 1770, he commanded the seizure of Mistra, Arcadia, and Navarino with the help of a landing party. On , a Russian squadron under the nominal command of Count Alexey Grigoryevich Orlov with Spidirov in charge of the avant-garde attacked the Turkish fleet in the Chios Strait and forced it to hide in the Chesma Bay. On the night of June 26 (July 7), the Russian squadron under the actual command of Spiridov and Samuel Greig destroyed the Turkish fleet during the Battle of Chesma and established supremacy in the Aegean Sea. In 1771-1773, Spiridov commanded the Russian fleet in this region. When he resigned from the Russian Navy in 1774, many attributed it to his resentment that all the credit for his victories went to Orlov.

Rosh Pina or Rosh Pinna (, lit. Cornerstone) is a town and local council in the Korazim Plateau in the Upper Galilee on the eastern slopes of Mount Kna'an in the Northern District of Israel. It was established as Gei Oni in 1878 by local Jews from Safed but was abandoned. In 1882, thirty Jewish families who had immigrated from Romania reestablished settlement as a moshavah called Rosh Pinna. The town is one of the oldest Zionist settlements in Israel. In it had a population of . Geography Rosh Pinna is located north of the Sea of Galilee, on the eastern slopes of Mount Kna'an, approximately east of the city of Safed, above sea level, latitude north 32¬∞ 58', longitude east 35¬∞ 31'. North of Rosh Pina is Lake Hula, which was a swamp area drained in the 1950s. History Around 1878, the Arab village of al-Ja'una sold half its lands, about 2,500 dunum, to Jews from Safed in order to fund the emigration of some of the villagers to the Hauran. Led by Elazar Rokah, the Jews moved into al- Ja'una, living among the Arabs for fear of being unable to cope with Bedouin raids on their own. They called their settlement Gei Oni (\\"Valley of my Strength\\") as a Hebrew adaption of the Arabic name. After one year of good harvests, a year of drought saw the Arabs mortgage their lands to money lenders, but the Jews were unwilling to do the same and left. In 1882, the settlement was renewed as a moshavah by immigrants from Romania, who named it Rosh Pinna (\\"cornerstone\\") after Psalm 118:22: \\"The stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone\\". Rosh Pinna was one of the first modern Jewish agricultural settlements in the history of the Land of Israel, then part of the Turkish Ottoman Empire. In 1883, it became the first Jewish settlement in the Land of Israel to come under the patronage of the Baron Edmond James de Rothschild. Rothschild's agent Joshua Ossovetski expanded the settlement with more land from Safed and Ja'una. Rosh Pinna had good relations with Ja'una, even establishing a modern Arab school there, but had some serious clashes with the el-Zangariya Bedouin tribe. Moshe David Shub (born 1854 in Moine≈üti; died 1938 in Jerusalem) had been sent ahead to find and purchase an appropriate piece of land.

Laurence Oliphant collected funds for Rosh Pina from Christadelphians and other sympathizers in Britain.Abstract: Laurence Oliphant's interest in the development of Jewish settlement in Ottoman Palestine, preceded his interest in the plight of Jewish communities in Eastern Europe. While his intensive involvement in these matters is well known, especially in modern Israel, the fact that the funds for his largesse were contributed by the Christadelphian Brotherhood has not previously been published.

They were produced as evidence against Queen Mary by the Scottish lords who opposed her rule. In particular, the text of the letters was taken to imply that Queen Mary colluded with Bothwell in the murder of her husband, Lord Darnley. Mary's contemporary supporters, including Adam Blackwood, dismissed them as complete forgeries or letters written by the Queen's servant Mary Beaton.Blackwood, Adam, History of Mary Queen of Scots (Maitland Club, Glasgow, 1834), pp.82-8. The authenticity of the letters, now known only by copies, continues to be debated. Some historians argue that they were forgeries concocted in order to discredit Queen Mary and ensure that Queen Elizabeth I supported the kingship of the infant James VI of Scotland, rather than his mother. The historian John Hungerford Pollen, in 1901, by comparing two genuine letters drafted by Mary, presented a subtle argument that the various surviving copies and translations of the casket letters could not be used as evidence of their original authorship by Mary.J. H. Pollen, Papal Negotiotions with Mary Queen of Scots (SHS, Edinburgh, 1901), 531-535. Political background: the abdication and the letters The genuine autograph signature of Mary Queen of Scots Some historians claim that the letters were written by the queen's lady, Mary Beaton The Queen's husband, Lord Darnley, was killed in mysterious circumstances at the Kirk o'Field in Edinburgh on 10 February 1567, and she married the Earl of Bothwell on 15 May 1567. Bothwell was widely thought to be the main suspect for Darnley's murder. The Earl of Moray, Mary's half-brother, and the 'Confederate Lords' rebelled against Queen Mary and raised an army in Edinburgh. Mary surrendered at the Battle of Carberry Hill on 15 June 1567, was imprisoned at Lochleven Castle, and on 24 July 1567 abdicated. Her infant son was crowned as James VI of Scotland on 29 July 1567 and Moray was made Regent of Scotland. At this time rumours spread that Mary had abdicated because of the discovery of letters which incriminated her. At the end of July 1567, the Earl of Moray, who was in London, told Guzman de Silva, Spanish ambassador to England, that he had heard of the finding of a letter in Mary's own handwriting to Bothwell which implicated her in the murder of Lord Darnley. He had not revealed this to Queen Elizabeth.Calendar State Papers Spain (Simancas), vol.1 (1892), no.434 via British History Online By the end of August 1567, Edmund Grindal, Bishop of London, had heard that letters in Mary's handwriting urging Bothwell to hurry up with the killing of Darnley had been found in a box of Bothwell's papers, and the Bishop sent this news to the Reformer Henry Bullinger in Geneva.H. Robinson, ed., Zurich Letters, 1558-1579, Epistolae Tigurinae, (Cambridge 1842), 197-8 in English, 117 Latin, \\"Fama est, in scriniis Bothwellii inventas fuisse literas ipsiusmet Reginae manu scriptas, in quibus Bothwellius ad necem regis mariti accelerandum hortata est.\\" According to the document called \\"Hay's Book of Articles,\\" compiled by the Confederate Lords in November 1568, which narrates events from Darnley's murder to Moray's Regency, the casket and letters were found and made known before Queen Mary agreed to abdicate, and public opinion after their discovery had brought her to that decision.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol.2 (1900), p. 558, Hay's Articles Moray convened his Privy Council on 4 December 1567. They made and signed a statement in preparation for the Parliament to enact Mary's abdication, which stated the letters demonstrated Mary's involvement in the murder; > \\"in so far as by diverse her previe letters writtin and subscrivit with hir > awin hand and sent by hir to James erll Boithvile chief executor of the said > horrible murthour, ..., it is maist certain that sche wes previe, art and > part (complicit) and of the actuale devise (plot) and deid of the foir- > nemmit murther of her lawful husband the King our sovereign lord's > father.\\"CSP. Scotland, vol.2 (1900), p.398 no.632 Mary escaped from Lochleven and made her way to England in May 1568. Her status was uncertain, as she had been accused of crimes and misrule. Elizabeth I of England ordered an inquiry into the question of whether Queen Mary should be tried for the murder of Darnley, as accused by the Scottish Lords who had deposed Queen Mary the year before. Moray came to England and showed the \\"casket letters\\" to Queen Elizabeth's officers. Conference at York, Westminster, and Hampton Court Duke of Norfolk was accused of trying to cover up the letters. Nearly a year later, in October 1568, the Earl of Moray produced the Casket letters at a conference in York, headed by Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk. Moray again showed the casket letters at Westminster on 7 December 1568. On 10 December Moray, the Bishop of Orkney, the Commendator of Dunfermline and Patrick Lord Lindsay signed a document swearing the letters were in Mary's handwriting, and on 12 December at Hampton Court, Moray's secretary John Wood showed this statement to the Lord Keeper, the Duke of Norfolk, the Earl of Bedford, the Earl of Leicester, the Lord Admiral, William Cecil, Ralph Sadler, and Walter Mildmay.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1900), pp. 578-9. The letters, sonnets, divorce and marriage contract were examined at Hampton Court on 14 December 1568, and the handwriting compared with Mary's letters to Queen Elizabeth. The evidence produced by the Scottish Earls, who were now sworn to secrecy by the English Privy council, was perhaps bewildering; > \\"the whole writings lying altogether upoun the counsel table, the same were > showed one after another by hap [chance], as the same did ly on the table, > than with any choyse made, as by the natures thereof, if time had so served > might have been.\\"Goodall, Examination, Volume 2, p. 256-259. For overriding political reasons, Queen Elizabeth neither wished to accuse Queen Mary of murder nor acquit her of the same, so the conference was intended as a political show. Queen Mary was refused the right to be present, though her accusers, including Moray, were permitted to be present. The outcome was that the Casket letters were accepted by the English commissioners as genuine after a study of the handwriting, and of the information contained therein. However, Queen Mary's commissioners were refused access to the letters to review or to study them. Yet, as Queen Elizabeth had wished, the inquiry reached the conclusion that nothing was proven. The outcome of the enquiry was to prolong doubts about Mary's character that Elizabeth used to prevent the Queens meeting. Accusations of collusion at York Regent Moray first showed the letters to Norfolk at the King's Manor, in York The meeting at York was established as a conference to negotiate an Anglo-Scottish treaty. John Lesley, Mary's secretary, heard from one of her accusers, William Maitland of Lethington, that Elizabeth's purpose was \\"not to end her cause at this time, but to hold the same in suspense\\". Maitland had heard this from the presiding officer at York, the Duke of Norfolk, while they were out riding together to Cawood on 16 October 1568.Bain, Calendar of State Papers, Scotland, Volume 2, p. 534. The contemporary historian, George Buchanan, who was present at York amongst the Scottish commissioners, described Maitland and Lethington's ride, and their agreement not to reach a decisive conclusion.Buchanan, George (1582). History of Scotland: Rerum Scoticarum Historia. Book 19. Chap. 16-19. In: Aikman, James (1827). History of Scotland. Volume 2. p. 543. William Maitland of Lethington was said to have played a double role at York This conversation came to light, having been found in Lesley's correspondence, and was cited in the charges of treason against Norfolk in January 1571. He was also charged with planning to marry the Scottish Queen, and asking Moray to suppress evidence against her at York.Calendar of the Manuscripts of the Marquis of Salisbury at Hatfield House, p. 461.Haynes, A Collection of State Papers, Volume 1, p. 573. In November 1571, Lesley testified that he had spoken with Norfolk in a gallery at York, after conferring with Lethington, and Norfolk was convinced that the publication of the letters would dishonour Mary forever.Haynes, Murdin, A Collection of State Papers, Volume 2, p. 53. When Norfolk was questioned about the conversations at York, he said that Lethington had told him he was working for Mary. Lethington, said Norfolk, began to make him think Mary was innocent and planted the idea that he should marry her.Haynes, Murdin, A Collection of State Papers, Volume 2, p. 179. Nevertheless, Norfolk was executed for treason in 1572. Lesley, who was a prisoner in the Tower of London, said that Lethington had sent copies of the casket letters to Mary (who was at Bolton Castle), but Lethington's messenger, Robert Melville, denied it.Lang, Andrew (1904). \\"Apology for Maitland\\". Miscellany of the Scottish History Society. Volume 2. Edinburgh. p. 149. Lesley also alleged there had been a plot to murder Moray on his return as he passed through North Allerton, but because Norfolk had persuaded Moray to be more favourable, the assassination was called off.Haynes, Murdin, A Collection of State Papers, Volume 2, p.51. After the York-Westminster conference, on 22 January 1569, Queen Elizabeth wrote to the Earl and Countess of Mar, who were the keepers of James VI at Stirling Castle, to counter rumours that Moray had made speeches and secret treaties in England to ensure that he would become King of Scotland to the prejudice of the young King.Report on the Manuscripts of the Earl of Mar and Kellie. Volume 1. York: Ben Johnson & Co. 1904. pp. 21-22. Subsequent fate of the letters The Casket letters were said to have been discovered in a house in Potterrow, now the University of Edinburgh Informatics Forum The charges against Queen Mary, known as Hay's Articles, were drawn up in November 1568; they state that the Earl of Bothwell, while planning his escape from Scotland, sent his servant, George Dalgleish, to fetch the letters from Edinburgh Castle, so that the \\"ground of the cause should never come to light\\". However, after recovering the letters, Dalgleish was captured by Mary's enemies, among them James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton.Bain, Calendar of State Papers, Scotland, Volume 2, p. 558. Morton testified in December 1568 that on 20 June 1567,Morton's declaration, made in December 1568, was first noted in 5th Report: Manuscripts of Alexander Malet (1883), p. 308-9. The document passed to the British Museum and was published in full by T.F. Henderson in Casket Letters, pp. 90-104 & appendix A, and in Calendar of State Papers, Scotland, Volume 2, p. 730-1. As T.F. Henderson points out, its detail undermines some arguments of previous historians. Dalgleish offered, under the threat of torture, to take his captors to a house in Potterrow, Edinburgh. Under a bed, they found a silver box engraved with an \\"F\\" (perhaps for Francis II of France), containing the Casket letters and a number of other documents, including the Mary-Bothwell marriage certificate.Bain, Calendar of State Papers, Scotland, Volume 2, pp. 569-571, 730-1. Morton passed the casket and letters into the keeping of Regent Moray on 6 September 1568. Morton declared he had not altered the contents and Moray promised to kept them intact and available to Morton and the Confederate Lords in order that they could explain their actions in future; \\"quhen-so-evir thai sal haif to do thair-with, for manifesting of the ground and equitie of their procedingis.\\"Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, 1545-1569, vol.1 (1879), p.641 Francis Walsingham had an agent in Scotland looking for the letters The letters seem to have been retained by the Douglas family after the sudden arrest and execution of Regent Morton in 1581. There were hints that George Douglas, brother of William Douglas of Lochleven, had merchandise of letters \\"worth the sight\\" in 1582, but this may refer to his attempts to negotiate for Queen Mary's return to Scotland at this time, called the \\"Association\\".Boyd, Calendar of State Papers, Scotland, Volume 6, p. 186.Moysie, David (1830). Memoirs of the Affairs of Scotland. Volume 1. Bannatyne Club. p. 39. In November 1582, the English diplomat Robert Bowes heard from James Douglas, Prior of Pluscarden, that both the coffer and the \\"originals of the letters betwixt the Scottish Queen and the earl of Bothwell\\" had been delivered to the Earl of Gowrie, who was leading the government of Scotland at that time. Bowes had been trying to find the whereabouts of the originals for Francis Walsingham.Stevenson, Correspondence of Robert Bowes, p. 236. Bowes asked Gowrie if he would send them to Elizabeth, saying that he had made previous arrangements for this, and established that Gowrie got them from Sanders Jordan. Jordan was known as one of Regent Morton's confidential servants and had been forced to testify at Morton's trial.Boyd, Calendar of State Papers, Scotland, Volume 5, pp. 671, 684. Gowrie explained that the letters were still relevant to those who deposed the Queen. Bowes argued that recent events and establishments were confirmed by acts of parliament and public instruments and the letters were not now significant. Gowrie would not give him the letters.Stevenson, Correspondence of Robert Bowes, p. 240-1. Bowes asked Gowrie again later in November, and wrote to Walsingham saying he had told Gowrie that Queen Mary was now claiming they were forgeries, and was hoping to obtain them herself to deface and destroy them (perhaps to further the \\"Association\\".) Bowes argued that Mary had the means to steal them from Scotland and they would be safer in England. Gowrie said he would have to tell the King about the request and Bowes preferred not.Stevenson, Correspondence of Robert Bowes, p. 253-4. In their next interview, Gowrie told Bowes that James VI already knew where the letters were.Stevenson, Correspondence of Robert Bowes, p. 265. The originals of the letters were probably destroyed in 1584 by James VI.Bingham, Caroline (1995). Darnley: A Life of Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, Consort of Mary Queen of Scots. Constable. p. 193. Only copies exist; one is in French, and the others are translations from the French into Scots and English. The nature of these documents ‚Äì authentic, forged, or only partly forged ‚Äì has been the subject of much discussion for more than four hundred years. Purportedly the silver casket itself was acquired by Mary Gordon, wife to the 1st Marquis of Douglas. Following her death, it was sold to a goldsmith, but was later reacquired by her daughter-in law, Anne Hamilton, 3rd Duchess of Hamilton. The casket originally had the Queen's arms engraved upon it, but was replaced successively by the arms of the Marchioness, then the Duchess. Together with other memorabilia related to the Queen, the casket is currently on display at Lennoxlove House, East Lothian, which was formerly \\"Lethington House\\", Maitland's family home.\\"Lennoxlove Casket\\", Hamilton Palace. The copy letters Four translated copies were preserved by the descendants of William Cecil. The copies do not reproduce signatures or dates, and they contain endorsements made by the copyist that indicate how the letters were to be used against Queen Mary.Calendar of the Manuscripts of the Marquis of Salisbury at Hatfield House, p. 376-380. Versions of some of the letters and sonnets were printed in George Buchanan's polemic Detectio Mari√¶ Regin√¶ and Dectectioun, and reprinted by James Anderson in 1727. Walter Goodall, in 1754, printed parallel English, French, and Latin versions without the clerk's endorsements.Goodall, Examination, Volume 2, pp. 1-53. The 18th-century historian William Robertson pointed out that the Scottish edition of Buchanan's Detectioun appears to preserve the original French opening lines of the letters introducing their translations, while the complete French texts seem to be merely translations from printed Latin or English copies.Robertson, William, \\"A critical dissertation concerning the murder of King Henry\\", in History of Scotland during the reigns of Queen Mary and of King James VI, vol. 2, (1794), pp.364-5 Four other copy letters and other copy documents were preserved in the English state papers and the Cotton Collection.Bain, Calendar of State Papers, Scotland, Volume 2, p. 730.Cotton Caligula C.I. folio 271. These were printed in the Calendar of State Papers, Scotland, Volume 2.Bain, Calendar of State Papers, Scotland, Volume 2, Appendix 2, pp. 722-730.

He was appointed to succeed The Earl of Glasgow as Governor of New Zealand on 6 April 1897, assuming office on 10 August. Lord Ranfurly became Honorary Colonel of the 1st Wellington Battalion (1898) and of the 1st South Canterbury Mounted Rifles (1902). He was created a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) in June 1901, on the occasion of the visit of TRH the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York (later King George V and Queen Mary) to New Zealand. His term ended on 19 June 1904, when he personally handed over office to Lord Plunket. He is remembered for his donation of the Ranfurly Shield, a New Zealand sporting trophy. On his return to England Ranfurly was made an Irish Privy Counsellor (1905); then for a time he returned to farm in Mildura, Victoria, Australia. But he soon devoted more and more time to his other great interest, the Order of St. John of Jerusalem. In 1914 he was a Knight of Justice, and Registrar of the Order in London, becoming (1915‚Äì19) Director of its Ambulance Department. In 1919 the French Government made him an Officer of the Legion of Honour for his services in this connection during the war. After the partition of Ireland, Lord Ranfurly was made a Privy Counsellor for Northern Ireland in 1923, also serving as Deputy Lieutenant and Justice of the Peace for his family's native County Tyrone. He continued his association with the Order of St. John, becoming Bailiff Grand Cross in 1926.

His father was Yawar Waqaq. His wife's name was Mama Runtucaya, and their sons included Inca Rocca, Tupac Yupanqui, Pachacuti and Ccapac Yupanqui. His original name was Hatun Tupaq Inca, but was named Viracocha after seeing visions of the god in Urcos. With Ccuri-chulpa, he had two additional sons, Inca Urco and Inca Socso.de Gamboa, P.S., 2015, History of the Incas, Lexington, Events in Viracocha Inka's life have been recorded by several Spanish writers. The source closest to the original indigenous accounts comes from Juan de Betanzos, a Spanish commoner who rose to prominence by marrying an Inka princess and becoming the foremost translator for the colonial government of Cusco. Traditional oral histories of the Inka have been recorded by the Spanish Jesuit Bernabe Cobo. According to these accounts, including a widely recognized sixteenth century chronology written by Miguel Cabello Balboa, Viracocha Inka was a \\"warlike\\" and \\"valiant\\" prince. As a young man, Viracocha declared that after he took the throne \\"he would conquer half the world\\". However, in 1438 when, according to Cobo, the Chanka offensive took place, Viracocha was advised to leave Cusco before the Chanca attack. He left for Caquia Xaquixahuana, taking his illegitimate sons, Inca Urco and Inca Socso. However, his third son, Cusi Inca Yupanqui (later famous as the Emperor Pachacuti) refused to abandon Cuzco and the House of the Sun. He remained with his brother Inca Rocca and six other chiefs, who together defeated the Chancas. The spoils were offered to Inca Viracocha to tread on, but he refused, stating Inca Urco should do so, as his successor. Inca Rocca later killed his brother Urco, and Inca Viracocha died of grief in Caquia Xaquixahuana. One chronicler, Sarmiento de Gamboa, states that Viracocha was the first Incan to rule the territories he conquered, while his predecessors merely raided and looted them. His captains, Apu Mayta and Vicaquirau, subdued the area within 8 leagues of Cuzco.

The film was a critical and box office disaster. Produced for $15 million, it made only $309 in ticket sales because it was played in a single movie theater and was pulled after only a week. Plot High school student Brad (Friedle) has had an unrequited crush on a classmate named Brooke (Marley Shelton) for years. After she asks him to come over one night to tutor her, she ends up wanting to have sex with him. But she only wants safe sex, and he does not have a condom (the use of Trojan in the title is a pun on the condom brand of the same name). In his quest to buy some condoms, he runs into all sorts of trouble; his dad's Jaguar gets stolen and then wrecked, he has a run-in with a crazy bus driver (Anthony Michael Hall), he is held hostage, he is pursued by a school janitor (Paulo Tocha) who accuses him of drawing graffiti, an odd pair of Hispanic siblings (Christine Deaver and Mike Moroff) who thinks he looks like David Hasselhoff, Brooke's dog, Brooke's jealous boyfriend Kyle (Eric Balfour), and a homeless man (David Patrick Kelly) who wants two dollars from him (and has secretly stolen his wallet), and he is arrested. After all of this and finally receiving a condom from a police officer (Lee Majors, who played Steve Austin in the 1970s TV series The Six Million Dollar Man; Major's policeman-character here is named \\"Officer Austin\\" as a nod to Majors' previous well-known role) who releases him, he realizes that the perfect girl has been there for him all along: his best friend Leah (Jennifer Love Hewitt), who has had feelings for him for a long time unbeknownst to Brad. Finally, Brad realizes his own feelings for Leah while also discovering Brooke is not as great as he thought she was, after he finds out that she only wants a one night stand with him instead of a relationship. Brad runs out to find Leah and professes his feelings to her, and they kiss each other by moonlight. After the end credits, Brad's parents are shocked by the sight of what is left of their car after the tow truck driver brings it back.

Created by writer Bill Mantlo and artist Keith Giffen, the character first appeared in Marvel Preview #7 (Summer 1976). He is an intelligent, anthropomorphic raccoon, who is an expert marksman, weapon specialist and master tactician. His name and aspects of his character are a nod to The Beatles' 1968 song \\"Rocky Raccoon\\". Rocket Raccoon appeared as a prominent member in the 2008 relaunch of the superhero team Guardians of the Galaxy. The character has appeared in several media adaptations as a member of that team, including animated television series, toys and video games. He appears in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019). In these appearances, Rocket Raccoon is voiced by Bradley Cooper, with motion capture provided by Sean Gunn. Publication history The character was created by Bill Mantlo and Keith Giffen, and inspired by the Beatles song \\"Rocky Raccoon\\". Other references to the song were featured in Rocket's appearance in The Incredible Hulk #271 (May 1982), which was titled \\"Now Somewhere In the Black Holes of Sirius Major There Lived a Young Boy Named Rocket Raccoon\\" and saw the Hulk help Rocket stop a villain trying to steal \\"Gideon's Bible\\", which in the Marvel Universe was a book that contained the sum of all knowledge on the Loonies colony. Rocket Raccoon first appeared in Marvel Preview #7 (Summer 1976), in the back-up feature \\"The Sword in the Star\\", under the name \\"Rocky\\". He would next appear in The Incredible Hulk #271 (May 1982), where it is learned that \\"Rocky\\" is short for \\"Rocket\\". In 1985, he received his own four-issue limited series and in an afterword to the first issue, Mantlo himself asserted that this was the same character seen in Preview, penciled by Mike Mignola and inked by Al Gordon with Al Milgrom. Rocket appeared in Quasar #15 in 1990 and later appeared in three issues of Sensational She-Hulk in 1992 (#44‚Äì46). The character only appeared in a total of ten comic books in his first thirty years of existence. Besides a brief appearance in a 2006 issue of Exiles, Rocket Raccoon was next seen in 2007's Annihilation: Conquest and Annihilation: Conquest - Star-Lord limited series, and their spin-off series, a new volume of Guardians of the Galaxy. He remained a regular member of the series cast until it was canceled with issue #25 in 2010, also appearing in the follow-up limited series The Thanos Imperative. Along with fellow Guardian Groot, Rocket starred in backup features in Annihilators #1‚Äì4 (May 2011 ‚Äì August 2011) and Annihilators: Earthfall #1‚Äì4 (November 2011 ‚Äì February 2012 ). Rocket Raccoon, along with the other members of the Guardians, appeared in issues #4-8 of Avengers Assemble, a series intended as a jumping-on point for fans of the film The Avengers. He appears prominently in Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3, a part of the 2012 Marvel NOW! relaunch. In February 2014, it was announced that Skottie Young will be the writer and artist for a Rocket Raccoon ongoing series. The series began in July 2014, with the first issue selling over 300,000 copies. Jake Parker replaced Young as the artist beginning with issue #5. The series ended in May 2015 as one of many titles to be cancelled for Marvel's Secret Wars event. A new volume, titled Rocket Raccoon and Groot, began in January 2016 as part of the All-New, All-Different Marvel relaunch. Fictional character biography Rocket Raccoon #1 (May 1985). Cover art by Mike Mignola and Al Gordon. Rocket Raccoon acts as the \\"Guardian of the Keystone Quadrant\\", an area of outer space sealed off from the rest of the cosmos by the so-called Galacian Wall. Rocket is captain of the starship Rack 'n' Ruin, and he and his first mate Wal Rus (a talking walrus) come from the planet Halfworld in the Keystone Quadrant, an abandoned colony for the mentally ill where the animal companions were genetically manipulated to grant them human level intelligence and bipedal body construction for many to become caretakers of the inmates. Rocket was Halfworld's chief law officer (\\"ranger\\") who protected the colony against various threats. At one point, Judson Jakes tried to steal the Halfworld Bible, but was thwarted by Rocket and various animal associates. Later, Lord Dyvyne abducted Rocket's friend Lylla Otter, and Jakes began the Toy War. As the Toy War continued, Blackjack O'Hare teamed up with Rocket, and Rocket was reunited with Lylla. The Rack 'n' Ruin was soon destroyed, as Judson Jakes and Lord Dyvyne teamed up to kill Rocket Raccoon. Rocket Raccoon and his friends cured the Loonies of their mental illnesses, as Judson Jakes and Lord Dyvyne were apparently killed. Rocket and the animals as well as the robots left Halfworld and took off into space for their own adventures. Some time later, Rocket was revealed to have been a laboratory subject on the Stranger's planet, and escaped his captivity there. =Guardians of the Galaxy= Rocket Raccoon resurfaced as a member of the team chosen to accompany Star-Lord on his mission to stop a Phalanx infiltration of the Kree homeworld. Rocket is depicted as a gifted military tactician who is fearless, loyal, and insightful. It is heavily implied that he has a case of obsessive compulsive disorder. Rocket's trademark rocket skates are absent. Rocket joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy at the behest of his friend Star-Lord. It is he who suggests that the team adopt that moniker after hearing it mentioned by Major Victory. Later, when the team almost disbands and Peter Quill (Star- Lord) disappears (sent into the Negative Zone by Ronan), Rocket keeps the team alive, and brings in Groot as member, as they had become firm friends. Rocket takes over as leader until they rescue Peter and save the Earth from an alien invasion. When the team tries to halt the growing War of Kings, Rocket leads the portion of the team assigned to make contact with the Shi'ar. They are unable to teleport into the Emperor Vulcan's flagship and have to be rescued by the Starjammers and Rocket's old friend Ch'od. They are able to bring back the rightful queen of the Shi'ar, but she is killed after Rocket departs, much to his horror. After the Guardians disband, Rocket Raccoon takes up a normal job with Timely Inc. He and Groot were reunited and tricked into returning to Halfworld: there, he found that his memories of the place were mostly half- truths and deliberately crafted fake memories. In reality, Jakes and Blackjack O'Hare had worked with Rocket in providing security at Halfworld Asylum for the Criminally Insane; Doctor Dyvyne had been Head of Psychology there; and both the anthropomorphic animals and the automaton clowns were deliberately created to work at the asylum, as their appearance would calm the inmates. The crises that Rocket half-remembered had been caused by the psychic supervillain the Star Thief, who had been admitted as an inmate and used his psychic powers to turn the inhabitants against each other. Rocket had turned the warders into a biological \\"key\\" to keep Star-Thief locked up, and deliberately altered his mind and left Halfworld so it could never be opened - but he was tricked into returning by the Thief, whose mind had escaped into the asylum after his host body died. When the Guardians of the Galaxy title was relaunched in 2013, Rocket was again a member of the team. In the first issue of \\"Secret Wars,\\" the Guardians of the Galaxy take part in the incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610, in which Rocket and Groot are killed by the Children of Tomorrow. =All-New, All-Different Marvel= As part of the \\"All-New, All-Different Marvel,\\" Rocket Raccoon takes leadership of the Guardians of the Galaxy while Star-Lord was busy handling things on Spartax. During the crisis in Avengers: No Road Home when light itself was nearly destroyed by the ancient Greek goddess of darkness Nyx, Rocket was one of the heroes who were inadvertently assembled to fight her, including Hawkeye, Hercules, Hulk, the Scarlet Witch, Spectrum, the Vision, Voyager, and Conan the Barbarian. Once Nyx was defeated, Rocket mused that this would allow him to cross \\"being an Avenger\\" off his bucket list. Powers and abilities Rocket Raccoon possesses the normal attributes of an Earth raccoon, including speed (which has been additionally amplified by his training), and an acute sense of smell, sight, hearing and touch. Sharp claws allow him to scale walls, buildings, and trees with ease. He is an accomplished starship pilot, a brilliant engineer and technician, and an expert marksman with the two laser pistols he carries as well as having an affinity for heavy weapons. He is a master military tactician and leader, attributes that help him take charge of the Guardians of the Galaxy when Star- Lord is unavailable. Supporting characters * Blackjack O'Hare - An anthropomorphic rabbit that has clashed with Rocket Raccoon. * Lylla - An anthropomorphic otter. Lylla is the C.E.O. of the biggest toy making company in the universe, Mayhem Mekaniks on the planet Halfworld. She is also the friend and lover of Rocket Raccoon. She inherited the company after her parents were murdered by Judson Jakes who wanted control of the company. The only way for Lylla to gain full control was through marriage. Lylla soon came under threat not just through Jakes, but also through Lord Dyvyne as they both wanted to control her toy company. Luckily Rocket Raccoon came to her aid and with the help of their friends, WalRus and Uncle Pyko, defeated both parties. Lylla traveled with Rocket afterwards to start a new life together. These events were later revealed to be false. Lylla, along with the rest of the halfworlders, were actually service animals who cared for mental patients on their planet. She was also apparently married to Blackjack O'Hare. She has not been seen since, and her marriage to Blackjack seemed retconned as he reappeared as a deadly mercenary and enemy to Rocket. * Wal Rus - An anthropomorphic walrus. Wal Rus is an engineer who aided Rocket Raccoon in his fight in the Toy Wars of which his niece, Lylla, was the center of conflict. His metallic tusks were interchangeable and he could be used as tools or weapons. His adventures with Rocket were later retconned when Rocket and Groot visited Halfworld and discovered that the halfworlders were actually service animals for mental patients. Wal Rus served as one of the security guards who worked for Rocket and had to once again help his friend when one of the patients mental powers began to manifest after years of waiting. This was retconned, yet again and he was recently seen working for Rocket and Groot in rescuing Princess Lynx and fighting Blackjack O'Hare, his brigade and Lord Dyvyne.

His real name in the film is 89P13. In addition to being genetically altered, Rocket is shown to have cybernetic implants within his body. He is only referred to as Rocket in the film, and asks \\"What's a Raccoon?\\" when told of his resemblance to the animal by Peter Quill. He serves as the team's pilot and technical expert, providing the weapon that Quill uses against Ronan the Accuser in the final confrontation and piloting a Ravager ship in the final assault against Ronan's fleet. Rocket also displays a talent for engineering jailbreaks. Having previously escaped from 22 prisons, he devises and executes a scheme to free his eventual teammates from a Nova Corps prison. Screenwriter Nicole Perlman has stated that early drafts of the film did not include the character due to \\"a little bit of a fear that he would come across as cartoonish because he's a raccoon.\\" Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige was persuaded to approve Rocket's inclusion in the film. A live raccoon named \\"Oreo\\" was used on set to help animators accurately capture the motion and behaviors of it for their CGI model. Director James Gunn took Oreo to the film's European premiere. * Cooper and Gunn reprised their roles for Rocket in the sequel, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, released in 2017. In the film, he causes the team to get chased by the Sovereign after stealing their anulax batteries. He is left on the planet where they crash landed (as a result of him and Quill fighting over the controls) to guard Nebula with Baby Groot after the rest explore Ego's planet. When captured by the Ravagers, Rocket and Yondu bond over their similarities and manage to escape the ship alongside Groot and Yondu's right-hand man Kraglin. They assist the other Guardians in combating Ego's forces. When Yondu stays behind to save Quill from the planet's destruction, Rocket gives him equipment and welcomes him as a member of the Guardians. He is saddened by Yondu's sacrifice in the climax. A running gag in the film includes Rocket winking with the wrong eye, being mistaken for different animals, being angered when called a raccoon and being criticized for his rude behavior. * Cooper and Gunn reprise their roles in the film Avengers: Infinity War. In this film, Rocket joins with Groot and Thor in helping to forge Thor's new weapon Stormbreaker. In addition, Rocket Raccoon helps provide Thor a prosthetic eye to replace the one that he lost in his fight with Hela. He later joins the other Avengers and Groot on Earth in the battle of Wakanda. After Thanos wipes out half the universe, Rocket is the only remaining Guardian alive on Earth, with Nebula surviving on Titan. * Cooper and Gunn reprise their roles again in Avengers: Endgame (2019) Three weeks after Thanos snapped the gauntlet, Rocket is living with the surviving Avengers at the Avengers headquarters. After Captain Marvel rescues Tony Stark and Nebula and brings them to the headquarters, Rocket and the others accompany her in going to the planet that Thanos is living in hopes of using the stones to bring everyone back. After they find out Thanos has destroyed the stones, Thor decapitates him. Five years later, Rocket has joined the Avengers and has been working alongside Nebula and helping those in need while reporting back to Natasha. After Tony and Scott Lang find a way to travel through time, Rocket joins them and goes back with Thor to Asgard in 2013. While there, Rocket gets the Reality Stone from Jane Foster and the two of them return to the present. Rocket helps Tony and Bruce Banner make a gauntlet and place the stones in it. Bruce puts on the gauntlet and snaps, returning all of the fallen heroes. The Thanos from 2014 appears in the present day and begins to attack the Avengers headquarters in which Rocket gets stuck in the rubble along with Bruce and James Rhodes, until they are rescued by Lang. Rocket then joins the Avengers in their final stand against Thanos and his army. Tony uses the Infinity Stones to disintegrate Thanos and his army, but is killed in the process. Rocket attends Tony's funeral, along with the rest of the Guardians of the Galaxy (except Gamora), and they leave Earth with Thor shortly after. * Cooper and Gunn will reprise their roles in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. * Rocket Raccoon appears in a brief non-speaking cameo in the 2018 Walt Disney Animation Studios film Ralph Breaks the Internet.

He was elected the Deputy Chairperson of the African Union Commission in July 2003 held in Maputo, Mozambique, and held the office until 6 February 2008, when he was succeeded by Erastus J. O. Mwencha. He was, until his election, the Senior Presidential Advisor to the President of Rwanda on the Great Lakes Region. Youth and education Patrick Kayumbu Mazimhaka was born in Rwanda and was raised and educated in Uganda, having left Rwanda in 1962 as a young boy in the aftermath of the 1959 Rwanda Revolution, which precipitated a large exodus of Rwandan refugees to Uganda. He attended Ntare School for his secondary education. He pursued his undergraduate studies at Makerere University in Kampala where he obtained a Bachelor of Science Degree in Geology. He received a Master of Science degree in 1975. He started working as a lecturer in the Faculty of Science at Makerere University and was soon appointed the Head of Department of Geology in the same Faculty. In early 1981 Mazimhaka moved to Kenya where he briefly worked as a consultant with a mining company before he finally relocated to Canada with his family. Early career While in Canada, he came into contact with many Rwandans who were determined as much as he was to return to Rwanda some day. He soon became deeply involved in the Rwandese Patriotic Front (RPF) activities, which had been founded to launch a struggle against the then Rwandan government that had denied its citizens the right to return to their homeland. When the RPF launched an armed war on 1 October 1990 against the Rwandan government, Mazimhaka was appointed RPF's Commissioner for External Relations. He was later elected the Vice-Chairman of RPF in 1993, a position he held until 1998. Mazimhaka was appointed the Minister of Youth, Sports and Cooperatives in July 1994 soon after the RPF had ousted the regime of Juv√©nal Habyarimana in April 1994. He held this position until 1996, when he was made Minister of Rehabilitation and Social Affairs. A year later he was appointed Minister in the Office of the President until 2000 when he was made a Special Envoy of the President. It was as a Special Envoy that Mazimhaka's ability in diplomacy was tested most. While dealing with the Rwandan government's policy on the Great Lakes, he was involved in the negotiations that led to several agreements, including the 2002 Pretoria agreement. This agreement outlined the disarmament of the former Rwandan Armed Forces (Ex-FAR) and the Interahamwe militia on the one hand, and the withdrawal of Rwandan forces from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) on the other. He had also previously been involved in negotiations for the formulation and implementation of The Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement in the DRC, while Minister in 1999.

He served as a Senator for Victoria from 1901 to 1913, having previously been a member of the colonial Parliament of Victoria. Early life Fraser was born on 21 August 1832 in Big Brook (now known as Lorne), a small rural township in Pictou County, Nova Scotia, Canada. He was the youngest son of Jane (n√©e Fraser) and William Fraser. His parents shared the same surname, although no familial connection has been noted between the two. Fraser's father was born in Beauly, Inverness-shire, Scotland, and claimed descent from Clan Fraser of Lovat. He arrived in Nova Scotia in 1801, as a small child. According to Fraser, his mother spoke fluent Scottish Gaelic and one of his grandfathers spoke \\"very little English\\". In 1906, he would become the inaugural patron of the Gaelic Society of Victoria, an organisation devoted to keeping the Gaelic language and customs alive in Australia. In an address to the society, he said that he could speak only a few sentences of Gaelic, but that he could still understand most conversations. In 1839, when Fraser was seven years old, his father was killed in a sawmilling accident. He began working on the family farm at a young age, and received limited formal schooling. Attracted by the Victorian gold rush, he immigrated to Australia at the age of 21, arriving in Melbourne in 1853. He immediately went to the goldfields at Bendigo, where he turned a profit selling supplies to miners. Business career In 1855, Fraser moved to Melbourne and opened a store on Elizabeth Street. One of his more notable contracts was to supply ballast to the Deniliquin and Moama Railway Company, a privately owned railway which connected Moama on the Murray River to Deniliquin in southern New South Wales. Instead of supplying blue metal, Fraser supplied quartz from the slag heaps of Bendigo gold mines. It met the specifications of the contract, but was not what was expected by the owners of the railway. Fraser later bought extensive estates in the Western District of Victoria and became a leader of the wealthy wool-growing class known as the Squattocracy. Politics Fraser was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly for the seat of Rodney in 1874, which he held until 1883. In 1886, he was elected to the Victorian Legislative Council, the traditional preserve of the squatters, representing South Yarra Province, and remained a member until 1901. He was a Minister without Portfolio from 1890 to 1892. He was a Victorian delegate to the 1894 Colonial Conference in Ottawa, and a member of the Constitutional Convention which drafted the Australian Constitution. Fraser at the 1897-1898 Australasian Federal Convention. In 1901, following the federation of the Australian colonies, Fraser was elected as one of the first six Victorian members of the Australian Senate, remaining a senator until his retirement in 1913. When elected he was a supporter of prime minister Edmund Barton's Protectionist Party, but he was not favourable to Barton's more liberal successor, Alfred Deakin, and sat as an independent conservative until 1909, when he joined Deakin's new Commonwealth Liberal Party, although belonging to its conservative wing. He was awarded a knighthood in the 1918 New Year Honours, becoming Sir Simon Fraser. Personal life and death Fraser married Margaret Bolger in 1862 and had two daughters. Following her death in 1880, he married Anne Collins in 1885 and had three sons with her. His brother-in-law was Robert Martin Collins, a member of the Queensland Parliament. One of these, (John) Neville Fraser, inherited Simon Fraser's property at Balpool in the Riverina district of New South Wales, where the future Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser (1975‚Äì83) grew up. Another son, Simon, was a champion footballer and rowed for Australia in the 1912 Stockholm Olympics. Simon died just two months before his father, aged 32. Fraser died of bronchitis on 30 July 1919, aged 86, in Melbourne. He was survived by his wife, Anne, a daughter and two sons.Fraser, Sir Simon (1832‚Äì1919) Obituaries Australia.

When a single-rider line is in use, empty seats on the ride vehicles are filled using individuals from the line, thus ensuring that every vehicle is carrying the maximum number of occupants possible. A park using a single-rider line offers guests a chance to wait for a significantly shorter length of time in exchange for not necessarily being able to experience the attraction with others in their party or from a desired seat (e.g., the front row of a roller coaster). Operations In practice, a single-rider line is available adjacent to the main entrance of the attraction. It is often manned by a park employee who will remind guests of any important policies. The line may bypass pre-show elements of the attraction; again, this is a trade-off that allows a much shorter wait in line. Typically, the line ends at the loading platform, where another employee is stationed. This employee will sort out the arriving guests from the main line and direct them to the ride vehicles. When an empty seat becomes available, the employee will direct the person at the front of the single-rider line to take the empty seat. The actual movement of the line is subject to many variables, including the loading speed of the attraction and, sometimes, the park's management style for dealing with such lines. Some parks will use single riders to fill odd- numbered seating configurations every time, while others will actively attempt to balance out the ride vehicle with guests in the main line, even inviting guests from further back in the main line to come forward and board. Generally, single rider lines are used for rides which have vehicles of four to eight people and are popular. Single rider lines can reduce wait times by 80% or more. Some rides may seat three individuals across, and due to the number of couples that visit theme parks, the third individual is needed to fill the row. Because single rider lines are normally used to fill up otherwise empty seats, they have no direct, negative impact on the main queue. This is different from paid priority queues, in which visitors are allowed to jump the main queue for an upcharge, taking away available rides. In most cases, a guest using a single-rider line must meet the normal rider requirements for the attraction and must be able to ride in any empty seat presented. Therefore, a number of park guests are generally discouraged from using these lines, such as: * Younger guests, who may not meet the height requirement for the attraction but would otherwise be able to ride if a parent or guardian was present (a responsibility the park will not impose on a stranger) * Handicapped guests, who might require special wheelchair seating or need assistance from a member of their party to board the attraction * Guests with larger frames (some muscular or obese guests), who would require a specific seat (one modified for larger guests) to experience the attraction Single-rider lines may be discontinued at the discretion of the park at any time, usually when there is no perceivable benefit to using the line. This can occur during off-peak operating days when the regular wait is very short already. Similarly, it may be temporarily discontinued when the single-rider line length creates waits that are longer than those for the regular line. Some parks provide provisions for visitors who are alone, regardless of whether a \\"single-rider line\\" is designated. Although not specifically a single-rider plan, some parks provide provisions for parents of children who are too small or young for an attraction.disneylandparis.com Praktische informatieTripadvisor Anaheim: Disneyland with babiesEfteling Baby switchHong Kong Disneyland Guests with Special Needs One party waits with the non-riders, until a responsible adult returns, then the waiting party enters the front of the single-rider line or another line.Legoland Californi√´ Parent SwapPhantasialand Voor gezinnenFamily vacation Critic SeaWorld Orlando Planning & TipsTokyo Disney Resort FAQ - At the parksUniversal Orlando Resort Traveling with Kids  See also  * Disney's Fastpass  References  Category:Amusement parks Category:Queue management ","title":"Single rider"},{"id":"2753501","text":"is the original title of a series of six Japanese films, about illegal highway racing in the Shuto Expressway, released between 1988 and 1996. An English subtitled version of the films series -renamed Freeway Speedway- was released on DVD in North America in 2004Freeway Speedway: Megalopolis Express Way Trial - The Complete Collection due to commercial success of popular Hollywood films like The Fast and The Furious (\\"before there was The Fast And The Furious, there was Freeway Speedway\\" is a quote appearing on the fourth DVD). A 4-disc re-release of the 2004 edition was made available in 2007, it was renamed Tokyo Speedway: The Complete Collection. Though also available in Hong Kong, the DVD edition was not released in Japan since the series is still banned and the last episode unreleased yet. Background Made during one of the most notorious eras of street racing, when the Mid Night Club ruled the scene and became one of the most infamous and feared or \\"respected\\" car clubs in Japan. Before they were banned from doing so, car magazines freely covered illegal races, but in the mid 1990s, Western media started to report about the B≈çs≈çzoku and in the 2000s a popular American street racing video game series was named after them, as Midnight Club. The first film, produced by Nikkatsu, was banned from release in Japan in cinema, due to its content. When racing driver and former street racer Keiichi Tsuchiya came on hand from the first sequel, it had adopted an anti street racing message, therefore avoiding a ban. The series became a semi biographical piece about him, partially about his experience as a hashiriya (native term for \\"street racer\\") and that when he quit to go professional racing. The series following the first film, were released under the Toei Company's V-Cinema line, meaning that they were all released direct-to-video. These films are believed to have influenced popular franchises including local video game series such as the Ridge Racer series and the Shutok≈ç Battle series (the name \\"shutok≈ç battle\\" is a dialogue line in the fourth film), as well as comic books like Wangan Midnight. It was also a source of inspiration for Hong Kong cinema's Legend of Speed and western video games like the Midnight Club series as well Hollywood films such as The Fast and the Furious. Plot summaryMegalopolis Expressway Trial (1988)= Skyline RS-Turbo (R30). Fairlady Z (S130). Street racers challenge each other to exceed the current speed record held by the F1 racer.

His older brother, Toshihiko sells not only his car (Silvia K's (S13)), but also his father's car as well, in order to buy a Red GT-R (BNR32). Toshihiko chose to race on the streets because he knows his son Keiichi won't be able to see it by the time he went pro. One day while visiting the tracks, the little boy happened to bump into Tsuchiya and was taken for a ride.

Being blamed for inadvertently killing Miyajima, Yusuke looks to redeem himself against Keiichi Tsuchiya, but pesters him further to race on the expressways which results in an altercation. Yusuke finally decides to change his ways and finally gets a chance to race Keiichi on the race track. ‚Ä¢ The ending theme is \\"Time Is Up\\" by Genda√óBenda from their 1992 album \\"Heroines\\". =Megalopolis Expressway Trial Max (1996)= Shuto K≈çsoku champion Shikiba Tatsuya (R33 GT-R) travels to Osaka to challenge Osaka Kanj≈ç (loop) champion Send≈ç (JZA70 Supra).

He was a nobleman from the County of Saint-Pol and went to the Holy Land either during the First Crusade or around 1100. He became an influential retainer of King Baldwin I of Jerusalem, who granted Caesarea and Sidon to him. After an Artuqid prince captured Baldwin I's successor, Baldwin II, Eustace was elected constable and bailiff (or regent) in April 1123. Shortly before his death in 1123, he defeated a Fatimid army as the Battle of Yibneh near Ibelin. Early life A poetry written by an unknown author listed Eustace among the crusaders from the Diocese of Th√©rouanne. According to the same source, he was a military official in the castle of Beaurainville in the County of Saint-Pol. He was a rear-vassal of Eustace III of Boulogne, because the counts of Saint-Pol held Beaurainville in fief from the Counts of Boulogne. Eustace's surname implies that either Eustace or one of his ancestors was responsible for the management of a store-house. Historian Alan V. Murray says, Eustace most probably came to the Holy Land in the retinue of his lord, Hugh II of Saint-Pol, during the First Crusade. Jonathan Riley-Smith writes that Eustace arrived to the Kingdom of Jerusalem after 1099. In the Kingdom of JerusalemRoyal vassal= Eustace became one of the most trusted officials of the younger brother of Eustace III of Boulogne, Baldwin I of Jerusalem. His participation in the Third Battle of Ramla in August 1105 was the first recorded event of his life in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Baldwin appointed him and Pagan of Haifa to start negotiations with Bertrand of Toulouse, William Jordan of Cerdanya and Tancred, the regent of Antioch, about the organization of a conference where they could resolve their conflicts. The crusader leaders assembled near Tripoli and reached a compromise in June 1109. Their reconciliation enabled their united armies to force the defenders of Tripoli to surrender on 26 June. Baldwin I granted Caesarea to Eustace before September 1110. Eustace also received Sidon, which was captured by the united forces of Baldwin I and Sigurd I of Norway on 5 December. He participated in Baldwin I's military campaigns against Shaizar in 1111. In the same year, he financed the building of siege machines during the unsuccessful siege of Tyre. He married Emma, the niece of Arnulf of Chocques, the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem. Arnulf gave Jericho to Eustace as Emma's dowry, although the town had been the property of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The lordships of Caesarea and Sidon and his wife's dowry made Eustace the most powerful noblemen in the entire kingdom. He also had preeminent position in the royal council. He was one of the four secular lords to attend the legislative assembly that Baldwin I's successor, Baldwin II of Jerusalem, and Warmund, Patriarch of Jerusalem held at Nablus on 16 January 1120. The assembly passed decrees that regulated the collection and spending of tithes and ordered the persecution of adultery, procuring, homosexuality, bigamy and sexual relations between Christians and Muslims. =Regent= The Artuqid prince Belek Ghazi captured Baldwin II on 18 April 1123. Patriarch Warmund convoked an assembly to Acre where Eustace was elected constable and bailiff to administer the kingdom during the king's captivity. Baldwin took possession of the fortress of Kharpurt where he had been held in captivity. Eustace soon sent reinforcements to Kharpurt to assist the king, but Balak ibn Bahram recaptured the fortress by the time the crusader troops reached it. A Fatimid army invaded the kingdom from Ascalon in May 1123. Eustace attacked the invaders near Ibelin and defeated them on 29 May. He did not long survive his victory, because he died on 15 June 1123. He was buried in the Church of Saint Mary of the Latins. According to Fulcher of Chartres he was \\"a stout man of honest character,\\" and \\"a wise and prudent man, with great experience in military matters\\" according to William of Tyre. Family With Emma, Eustace was the father of the twins, Gerard (also known as Eustace II) and Walter, who succeeded him in Sidon and Caesarea respectively. Emma married Hugh II of Le Puiset, Count of Jaffa. The relationship between her second husband and her sons was tense.

Access to this weapons range is restricted to the public at certain times. Territorial status The whole peninsula is within New South Wales in the state electorate of South Coast, and the federal electorate of Gilmore. The ownership of crown land (which, in Australia refers to all government-owned land) on the southern coast of the peninsula was transferred from New South Wales to the federal government in 1909 by the same Act of Parliament that transferred the ownership of the Jervis Bay Territory on the southern side of Jervis Bay. Then in 1915, the jurisdiction over Jervis Bay Territory was transferred to the Commonwealth to be administered by the Australian Capital Territory, but the region on the Beecroft Peninsula was excluded from the transfer. It remains a part of New South Wales. Most of the remaining land on the peninsula has subsequently been purchased by the Commonwealth to be used by the Royal Australian Navy. Because of the association with the nearby Jervis Bay territory and because it is occupied by the Navy, there is sometimes the mistaken belief that the southern strip of the peninsula is either a part of the ACT or a separate federal territory.For example in 1995, a geology map published by The Australian Geological Survey Organisation (Geoscience Australia) included this strip in the Jervis Bay Territory and the Shoalhaven City Council excludes the area from its land-use maps . Geology The Beecroft Peninsula is the best example of a Permian cliffed coast in New South Wales. The peninsula is a remnant of a Permian sandstone and siltstone plateau, overlain with a patchy veneer of Tertiary and Quaternary sand and gravel deposits. The eastern coast consists of almost continuous cliffs, rising up to 91 metres at Point Perpendicular and erosion processes have created caves, blowholes, small peninsulas, clefts, arches, and stacks such as the Drum and Drumsticks. The western coast dips gently into the bay with several low cliffs and sandy beaches. The peninsula is connected to the mainland at its northern end by the Carama Isthmus, a sand swamp, which is 211 m wide, at its narrowest width, at low-water mark.Australian Geological Survey Organisation.1995.

Beecroft Peninsula occurs near the southern boundary of the Hawkesbury Sandstone geological unit. Accordingly, the place has a high number of flora and fauna species at the limit of their distribution. BiodiversityFlora= The vegetation on the Beecroft Peninsula is a complex mosaic of heathland, eucalypt forest, and rainforest, mangroves, saltmarsh and swamps.Adam, P. and P. Hutchings. 2010.

Cunninghamia 3:231‚Äì254.Skelter, N. and P. Adam. 1994. Beecroft Peninsula vegetation survey. Report for the Australian Nature Conservation Agency and the Department of Defence. The most widespread vegetation community is heath and this area of heath is the largest remaining on the south coast of New South Wales. There are 573 plant species occurring in eight major and 27 minor vegetation types. Heathland dominated by heath banksia (Banksia ericifolia) and scrub she oak (Allocasuarina distyla) occurs over approximately 50% of the peninsula. Other heath communities dominated by narrow-leaved bottlebrush (Callistemon linearis) and Lepidosperma filiforme are restricted to the northwest. Shrubland communities are dominated by scrub she oak, heath banksia, tick bush (Kunzea ambigua) and Leptospermum epacridoideum. The regionally-uncommon \\"she oak shrubland\\" is widespread on the peninsula. Open forest communities dominated by several eucalypts, rough barked apple (Angophora floribunda), and black she oak (Allocasuarina littoralis) are restricted to deep soils in sheltered positions. There are three forest communities; littoral rainforest, swamp oak (Casuarina glauca) forest, and turpentine (Syncarpia glomulifera) forest restricted to a single site at the head of Plutus creek. Woodland communities dominated by bloodwood (Corymbia maculata), silvertop ash (Eucalyptus sieberi), coast tea-tree (Leptospermum laevigatum), Leptospermum trinervium and saw banksia (Banksia serrata) are associated with sand dunes. Swamp communities dominated by jointed twig-rush (Baumea articulata), swamp paper-bark (Melaleuca ericifolia) and common reed (Phragmites australis) occur in depressions adjacent to creeks. A small area of grey mangrove (Avicennia marina) occurs near Chinaman's beach. A sedgeland dominated by slender twine-rush (Leptocarpus tenax) and Ptilothirix deusta is restricted to the north western of the peninsula.

The common scaly-foot (Pygopus lepidopodus), a legless lizard, occurs on the peninsula, this species is recognised as the most primitive of the legless lizards and has strong Gondwanic associations. Twelve species of amphibian have been recorded from streams and swampy areas. Conservation and Management In recognition of its outstanding natural, cultural and historic values which encompasses a diverse range of vegetation, rare plant, bird and mammal species and sites of Aboriginal and historical significance, the Beecroft Peninsula was listed on the Commonwealth Heritage List in 2004, giving it protection by Federation environmental legislation. Its reservation as a firing range has meant that very little of the original vegetation in the area has been cleared and remains in relatively good condition, despite periodic localised short-term damage by military exercises, providing a wide diversity of good quality habitat for native fauna. The land of the Beecroft Peninsula is managed by the Department of Defence‚Äôs Shoalhaven Environment Team as of 2015.Department of Defence. 2015. Welcome to Beecroft Weapons Range, viewed on 24 April 2015, http://www.pointperp.com/PDF/Welcome_to_Beecroft_Weapons_Range.pdf There is no current management plan for the area. =Littoral rainforest= The nationally critically endangered littoral rainforest community is found on the western side of the peninsula and is a remnant of coastal rainforests that were once extensive in southern Australia. It contains several species near the southern limit of their distribution; these include ribbonwood (Euroschinus falcata var.falcata), plum pine (Podocarpus elatus), coast canthium (Canthium coprosmoides), deciduous fig (Ficus henneana), flintwood (Scolopia braunii), celery wood (Polyscias elegans), and Cissus sterculiifolia. The rainforest also contains a mixture of sub-tropical and temperate rainforest species. As such, this community is significant in the study of the latitudinal shift from sub-tropical to temperate forests. The littoral rainforest behind Long Beach is a well-preserved example of rainforest on sand ‚Äì a rare vegetation type in New South Wales. Littoral rainforest is threatened by habitat loss and degradation, weed invasion, inappropriately placed paths and inappropriate fire regimes. Important management options include protecting and restoring remnants, relocating paths, removal of invasive weeds and hazard reduction burns in the vicinity of the forest area. There is no recovery plan for this community type. =Small mammals= From 1993 to 2002 a study was conducted on the peninsula that measured the response of the small and medium-sized mammal populations to continuous fox control. The bottle-necked entrance to the otherwise ocean-ringed peninsula make for ideal geography for fox control. The most surprising result of the study was the appearance of the long-nosed bandicoot, which had never previously been recorded from the Beecroft Peninsula, despite surveys. Remains of the bandicoot are however found in relatively recent Aboriginal middens. The long-nosed bandicoot not only appeared on the peninsula but increased significantly in abundance from the time it was first recorded in 2000. Similarly, the bush rat had also never been recorded and appeared in the fauna surveys after the commencement of fox control. A third species, the common ringtailed possum, showed a significant increase in abundance as a result of the fox control study. The brown antechinus, the black rat, the brushtailed possum and the sugar glider showed no significant change in abundance. This nine year fox control study on the Beecroft Peninsula provides compelling evidence that small to medium-sized \\"critical weight range\\" mammal populations have been driven to extinction or near extinction by fox predation and recover when the ongoing predation pressure of foxes is removed.Woinarski, J. C., A. A. Burbidge, and P. L. Harrison. 2015. Ongoing unraveling of a continental fauna: Decline and extinction of Australian mammals since European settlement. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 112:4531‚Äì4540.Burbidge, A. and N. McKenzie. 1989. Patterns in the modern decline of Western Australia's vertebrate fauna: causes and conservation implications. Biological Conservation 50:143‚Äì198 This conclusion is supported is further supported by the retention of most of original vegetation on the peninsula so historical mammal decline was not due to the common cause of habitat destruction. =Eastern bristlebird= The eastern bristlebird is a nationally endangered small, brownish bird approximately 200 mm in length, cryptic and ground dwelling living in low dense vegetation cover.Baker, J. 1997. The decline, response to fire, status and management of the eastern bristlebird. Pacific Conservation Biology 3:235. In 2000, the eastern bristlebird had not been recorded from the Beecroft Peninsula for over a century and re-establishment of extinct populations was identified as an important recovery action for the species. During 2003‚Äì2005, 45 birds were successfully translocated from the Bherwerre Peninsula, on the opposite side of Jervis Bay, to the Beecroft Peninsula.Bain, D., K. French, J. Baker, and J. Clarke. 2012. Translocation of the Eastern Bristlebird 1: radio‚Äêtracking of post‚Äêrelease movements. Ecological Management & Restoration 13:153‚Äì158.Baker, J., R. J. Whelan, L. Evans, S. Moore, and M. Norton. 2010. Managing the Ground Parrot in its fiery habitat in south-eastern Australia. Emu 110:279‚Äì284. The reintroduction has shown medium-term success; in 2012 the Beecroft population had grown to 94 birds. The eastern bristlebird recovery plan identifies habitat fragmentation, widespread and frequent fires and predation as threatening processes and appropriate fire management of habitat, feral predator control, controlling invasive weeds as very high priority. =Eastern ground parrot= The eastern ground parrot is a distinctive, bright grass-green, long-tailed, ground-dwelling parrot of the coastal and sub- coastal heaths, reaching 30 cm long. It is a rare and iconic endemic of coastal and sub-coastal heathlands in southern Australia including the Beecroft Peninsula where there is an estimated maximum population size of 450 individuals. A long term study of ground parrot habitat found that the species occurs in long-unburnt habitat and that fire should not be used to manipulate the ecological functioning of habitat for the persistence of ground parrot population. Frequent and widespread fire had been identified as a threat to the eastern ground parrot and management recommendations include exclusion of fire for at least 7 years after a fire. Environmental Threats Like most natural reserved land areas in Australia, the Beecroft Peninsula and its biodiversity are threatened by predation by introduced feral species and invasive plants. Five species of feral mammal have been recorded, including the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), feral cat (Felis cattus), black rat (Rattus rattus), rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and house mouse (Mus domesticus). Foxes are a significant threat to the peninsula‚Äôs non-flying small mammal population. Low soil fertility on Beecroft Peninsula means that few weeds species can grow except in cleared areas and they do not usually enter undisturbed vegetation.Ingwersen, F. 1976. Vegetation of the Jervis Bay Territory. Australian Government Publishing Service. There are 23 weed species on the peninsula and the major species are Senecia Madagascariensis, Protoaparagus aethiopucus and Kalanchoe tubiflora. Erosion is responsible to localised habitat degradation as there are many secondary vehicular tracks that have become severely eroded following major rains and side tracks have been created through heath communities in places where original roads have become impassable. Fire frequency, some of which are started by naval exercises, may adversely impact on some the plants and animals. Aboriginal Heritage Archaeological evidence demonstrates that Aboriginal occupation of the Beecroft Peninsula extends back at least 7000 years. This undoubtedly underestimates the time that Aboriginal people have lived in the area because radiocarbon dates obtained from nearby coastal sites elsewhere in New South Wales demonstrate occupation back to 20 000 years.Zakharov, J. 2010. A review of Aboriginal cultural factors for the Jervis Bay area, New South Wales. Wetlands (Australia) 6:9‚Äì18. The Beecroft Peninsula is of particular significance to the Jerrinja and Wreck Bay Village Aboriginal communities as part of their traditions. Their stories describe the movement of ancestral beings, including Bundoola, Spandula, the Bip Bip women and others, as they formed the landscape, people and the law. The Beecroft Hill area, the Devils Hole area, the Drum and Drumsticks area and the Duck Hole area form part of these stories while the southern part of Jervis Bay has strong cultural associations for women. The stories of the activities of ancestral beings create links with neighbouring regions and Aboriginal people with traditional links to the area say that Jervis Bay is the birthplace of the thirteen tribes of the south. There are a large numbers of middens mainly located near the beaches on the southern and western sides of the Peninsular that contain evidence of past patterns of Aboriginal exploitation of marine resources. Other sites providing evidence of past Aboriginal activity in the area include rockshelters with occupation debris, artefact scatters, grinding grooves, ceremonial grounds and rock shelters with paintings and stencils on the walls.

It depicts a love story between Du Liniang and Liu Mengmei that overcomes all difficulties, transcending time and space, life and death; the pair unite at the end. Tang's play diverges from the short story in that it dynamically integrates the legendary and the reality in Ming Dynasty. Scenes of love in dreams, Du Liniang's revival, or any supernatural element seem absurd in play, but it reflects the sprout of humanism, through protagonists' strong desire and unremitting pursuit of free love, and uncovers the degeneracy of the society under feudalism at that time. The play was originally written for staging as Kunqu opera, one of genres of traditional Chinese theatre arts. It was first performed in 1598 at the Pavilion of Prince Teng. With its sophisticated plot, magnificent dramatic structure and well-depicted characters, The Peony Pavilion has become the most popular play from the Ming dynasty and Du Liniang became one of the most representative women in ancient Chinese drama. Most audience and contemporary critics have a high estimation of the play. It has become one of the most classic in traditional Chinese theatre art, and Kun theatre troupes can not consider their repertoire complete without this play. Tang Xianzu was one of the greatest dramatists and writers in Ming Dynasty, and The Peony Pavilion can be regarded as his most successful masterpiece in his life. It is also one of drama in Tang's famous collection Linchuan si meng (The Four Dreams in the Jade Tea Hall), the other three plays are Zichai Ji (The Purple Hairpin), Nanke Ji (A Dream Under the Southern Bough) and Handan Ji (The Handan Dream). Both the play and its dramatist get a high reputation on Chinese and international stages, and the study on Tang Xianzu has become a popular subject today. The play has a total of 55 scenes,Birch, p. xiv. which can run for more than 22 hours onstage.Lunden, Jeff, \\"The Peony Pavilion, a Vivid Dream in a Garden.\\" NPR Music, November 30, 2012. https://www.npr.org/sections/deceptivecadence/2012/11/30/166153763/the-peony- pavilion-a-vivid-dream-in-a-garden.  Synopsis  Illustration of Du Liniang drawing her self-portrait, from a Jiuwotang Hall imprint of The Peony Pavilion, Ming dynasty The performance onstage traditionally focuses on the love scene between Du Liniang and Liu Mengmei, but its original text also contains subplots pertaining to the falling Song Dynasty's defense against the aggression of the Jin Dynasty. The story is set in the last days of the Southern Song Dynasty. On a fine spring day, her maid persuades Miss Du Liniang, the sixteen-year-old daughter of an important official, Du Bao, to take a stroll in the garden, where she falls asleep. In Miss Du's dream, she encounters a young scholar (identified later in the play as Liu Mengmei, whom in real life she has never met). Liu Mengmei's bold advances ignite a passionate romance between the two lovers and it flourishes rapidly. Du Liniang's dream is interrupted by a flower petal falling on her (according to her soliloquy in a later act, \\"Retracting the Dream\\"). Du Liniang can not seem to get the oneiric love affair out of her mind, and her lovesickness quickly consumes her. Unable to recover from her fixation, Du Liniang wastes away and dies. The president of the underworld adjudicates that marriage between Du Liniang and Liu Mengmei is predestined and Du Liniang ought to return to the earthly world. Du Liniang then appears to Liu Mengmei in his dreams who now inhabits the garden where Du Liniang had her fateful dream. Recognising Du Bao's deceased daughter to be the girl who turns up in his dreams, Liu agrees to exhume her body upon her request and this is how Du Liniang is brought back to life. Liu visits Du Bao and informs him of his daughter's resurrection. The disbelieving and furious Du Bao threw Liu into prison for being a grave robber and an impostor. The ending of the story follows the formula of many Chinese comedies. Liu Mengmei narrowly escapes death by torture thanks to the arrival of the results of the imperial examination in which Liu has topped the list. The emperor pardons all. In the first scene, there is a four-sentence introductory speech succinctly summarizing the main storyline:  Scenes  There are total of fifty-five scenes in the play.

Interpretation and criticism  Script and its staging = Albeit conventional in its narrative structure, notably its deus ex machina ending, The Peony Pavilion is hailed as one of the high points of Chinese literature because of the highly refined and subtle lyrics that it features. Accentuated by the then newly developed Kun music, the lyrical prose of the play patiently weave a fabric of nuances and metaphors that elegantly transgresses the apparent divide between nature's beauty and man's inner cosmos of emotions and desires. Through the lights and shadows of this lyrical fabric transpire ravishing delicacy and intoxicating effeteness and yet, almost antithetically, a persistent undercurrent of youthful optimism. The magic of the play's prose embedded in Kunqu quickly carries the audience to a unique experience of a literary and musical banquet of metaphors, a dance of the imagination and, above all, a celebration of sensitivity. For this reason the Peony Pavilion sets the measure for all later Kun operas. From 1598 until 1616, the year Tang passed away, the Peony Pavilion was always performed with whole scenes onstage. But later, more and more adaptions focusing on several scenes were adopted onstage rather than with a complete one, since it would cost large number of expend/ energy and time to run the whole play. \\"A walk in the Garden\\" (ÈÅäÂúí/Ê∏∏Âõ≠) and \\"The Interruption of a Dream(È©öÂ§¢/ÊÉäÊ¢¶)\\", these two acts actually originating from one scene, namely \\"A Surprising Dream\\" in the original text, and \\"Reflection On the Lost Dream\\" (Â∞ãÂ§¢/ÂØªÊ¢¶), are generally considered as the apogee of Kunqu in term of their literary achievements as well as for their musicality, choreography and the integration of all components. Due to the unique of its lyrics, rhythm, ancient style prose written, the translation became a daunting challenge for literature scholars and theatre practitioners. Besides, recent adaptations have sought to inject new life, such as more accessible scripts for modern audience, new choreography or new theatrical technologies, into one of China's best-loved classical play, but since such efforts have met with opposition from the Kun opera traditionalists, to a certain degree, some scholars seriously critique them. To keep its traditions or to make it modernized has become a controversial conversation in Chinese theatre. = Humanism = The play was widely acclaimed by the public and critics when it was first presented onstage, and it is also regarded as the Chinese version of \\"Romeo and Juliet\\". Through narrating a tortuous love story, Tang portrays an image of a young couple with a strong desire for democratic thoughts and individual emancipation, which evoked most audience empathy, especially women audiences, and regarded Du Liniang as their idol for free love. Subject/ theme on \\"uncovering social darkness and caring people sufferings\\", \\"qualities of heroism\\", attacking feudalism and marriage system\\", \\"exposing the miserable fate of women\\" and \\"reflecting family and social ethics\\", etc., are generally discussed in ancient Chinese drama, which is also evident in The Peony Pavilion. = About \\"Dream\\" = Some people also raise an idea that Tang's works of \\"The Four Dreams\\" somehow resemble Freud's interpretation of dreams. From the perspectives of psychoanalysis, the action of \\"A walk in the Garden\\" is the awakening of Du Liniang's suppressed urges and unacknowledged emotions, while the scene of \\"A Surprising Dream\\" is exactly her fantasy of sexual satisfaction.  Performance productions  Young Lovers' Edition of The Peony Pavilion, produced by Pai Hsien-yung, performed by Suzhou Kunqu Opera Theatre of Jiangsu at Peking University Hall, 2006 * In 2012, an outdoor production of Metropolitan Museum galleries presented The Peony Pavilion in a compact seventy-minute version developed and directed by celebrated composer Tan Dun with choreography by Huang Doudou, one of China's most prominent dancers, in the Met's Astor Court, the courtyard modeled on a seventeenth-century garden. This production is available on demand on the Metropolitan Museum's website. * In 2012, the China Arts & Entertainment Group, a creative enterprise under the administration of the Ministry of Culture for the People's Republic of China, announced the United States premiere of a new dance drama production of The Peony Pavilion by China Jinling Dance Company of Nanjing would be performed at the David H. Koch Theater, Lincoln Center, for four performances in early January. * In June 2008, the Suzhou Kunqu Opera company performed The Peony Pavilion at Sadler's Wells, London, the UK premiere. It was presented in 3 parts on consecutive evenings, each lasting 3 hours, though still much shorter than the original 20 hours. * In May 2008, the National Ballet of China premi√®red a two-scene ballet adaptation of The Peony Pavilion in Beijing. This production was rewritten and directed by Li Liuyi, choreographed by Fei Bo, and the music was composed by Guo Wenjing. It also attended Lincoln Center Festival in 2008, at David H. Koch Theater, and Edinburgh International Festival in August 2011.Chen Jie \\"The Stage is Set\\" ChinaDaily.com 19 April 2011 http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2011-04/19/content_12349411.htm * The Imperial Granary's production The Peony Pavilion in Beijing, directed by Kunqu Opera master Wang Shiyu and scenography by the renowned Lin Zhaohua, was a permanent residency show for about 5 years since the premiere in 2007. * In 2004, Pai Hsien-yung's youth edition of The Peony Pavilion aims to rejuvenate the traditional staging. Pai, a Chinese scholar at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and his colleagues - scholars and performers, some brought back from retirement - spent five months editing Tang's script. Working out of the Jiangsu Suzhou Kunqu Theater, the group condensed and adapted the original fifty-five scenes to twenty-seven scenes, and twenty hours of performance time to nine. Bai, who had chosen The Peony Pavilion because of its universal message of love, hoped that his rendition would attract youth to Kunqu. In fact, in its tour of China's top universities, the show was marketed as the Youth Edition of Peony Pavilion.\\"Youth Edition of Peony Pavilion.\\" ChinaCulture.org. 11 Feb. 2009. Ministry of Culture. 11 Feb. 2009 (The production also toured in Taipei, Hong Kong, Macau, seven cities in mainland China, and the Zellerbach Theater in Berkeley, California.) According to Bai, the goal of this youth-oriented production was to \\"give new life to the art form, cultivate a new generation of Kunqu aficionados, and offer respect to playwright Tang and all the master artists that came before.\\"\\"Background to Peony Pavilion.\\" Peony Pavilion- Young Lovers Edition. University of California Los Angeles. 11 Feb. 2009 http://www.international.ucla.edu/china/mudanting/ His production of The Peony Pavilion was his way of doing so. Pai Hsien-yung has also used The Peony Pavilion as inspiration for a short story and a television script. * Recent adaptations of The Peony Pavilion and allusions in popular music have revived interest in Kunqu, an art form that had been in danger of disappearing into obscurity. In 2001, UNESCO proclaimed Kunqu as a \\"Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity,\\" yet the secrets of that heritage were kept by only a few aging masters in even fewer schools and institutions. * In 1999, Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts produced a 20-hour version of The Peony Pavilion, directed by Chen and starring Qian Yi as Du Liniang. This 20-hour version was perhaps the first full-length staging in 300 years. Lincoln Center's version toured extensively, including New York, Paris, Milan, Singapore, Caen, Charleston, Aarhus, Berlin, Perth and Vienna. * In 1998, an experimental or ‚Äúavant-garde‚Äù production of The Peony Pavilion composed by Tan Dun, directed by Peter Sellars and performed by Kun Opera Troupe, premiered in Vienna, and travelled to London, Roma, Paris, and Berkeley later. Also, a CD recording of this opera was released entitled \\"Bitter Love\\". = Famous performers = * Mei Lanfang, sometimes paired with Yu Zhenfei (‰øûÊåØÈ£õ/‰øûÊåØÈ£û) as Liu Mengmei, was famous for his sensitive portrayal of Du Liniang. * The most famous actress of recent years is likely Zhang Jiqing's (ÂºµÁπºÈùë/Âº†ÁªßÈùí) traditional approach out of Nanjing's Jiangsu Province Kun Opera. * In Shanghai, Jennifer Hua Wenyi (ËèØÊñáÊº™/ÂçéÊñáÊº™) was very popular in the role, and has played the role abroad several times. * For a particularly pleasant and graceful interpretation, one may refer to Zhang Zhihong (ÂºµÂøóÁ¥Ö)'s performances in the 1990s.

Others adaptions Pop music = * Leehom Wang, the popular Taiwanese-American music artist, referenced The Peony Pavilion in his song \\"Beside the Plum Blossoms\\" (Âú®Ê¢ÖÈÇä) on his album Heroes of Earth, which drew heavily from Beijing Opera and Kunqu inspiration.\\"Asia Finest Alexander Lee-Hom Wang.\\" Asia Finest.com. 11 Feb. 2009 Lee-Hom sang and rapped over traditional Kunqu melodies blended with hip-hop beats. The music video features the artist, in modern clothes, superimposed on animated scenes. The animation depicts thematic and stylistic elements of The Peony Pavilion as well as hip-hop imagery: a break dancer does tricks atop a pavilion and pink peonies turn into speakers. A performer dressed in Kunqu costume plays the role of Liu in the music video, often singing with the Kunqu technique next to Lee-Hom. The artist quotes lines from The Peony Pavilion and entreats his lover, \\"Let me love you‚Ä¶in the classical style.\\"Wang Leehom. \\"Beside the Plum Tree.\\" By Leehom Wang. MP3. 2005. The lyrics reveal a longing to return to the way love was portrayed in the drama. In this way, Lee-Hom draws visual and thematic inspiration from The Peony Pavilion in his song, signaling its relevance in contemporary popular culture. * The Chinese indie band Carrchy use The Peony Pavilion as inspiration for their lyrics. The two young members of Carrchy, lyricist Keli and producer Fly, share an affinity for ancient Chinese opera and drama, an interest that appears prominently in their work. Borrowing some of the original text, Carrchy alludes to The Peony Pavilion in their song \\"Romantic Dream in the Garden\\" (ÈÅäÂúíÈ©öÂ§¢).\\"Band Carrchy.\\" CRIENGLISH.com. 29 Dec. 2007. 11 Feb. 2009 http://english.cri.cn/webcast/ The band uses Tang's lyrics and story to create the dual sensations of a lush and sensual spring and sorrow upon awakening from the dream. These Ming Dynasty era-inspired lyrics play over thoroughly modern music. * In the Jiangsu Pavilion at the Shanghai 2010 World Expo, a 13-minute short section from The Peony Pavilion produced by the Kunqu Opera Department of the Jiangsu Performing Art Group Co., Ltd. filmed in high definition was presented for the audience. Luo Chenxue and Zhang Zhengyao, young outstanding Kunqu Opera performers from Jiangsu province, play the leading roles in this film. By combining the traditional Kunqu performing art and modern video art techniques, a stage of poetic and simplified scenes is presented.China's version of 'Romeo and Juliet' refreshed, http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2010expo/2010-06/07/content_9944782.htm = Film = * In 2001, Joey Wong (ÁéãÁ•ñË≥¢/ÁéãÁ•ñË¥§), was called Peony Pavilion in English. Though only indirectly related to the original work in terms of plot, it used the music extensively. * A Taiwanese movie W«í de mƒõil√¨ y«î ƒÅich≈çu ÊàëÁöÑÁæéÈ∫óËàáÂìÄÊÑÅ directed by Chen Kuo-fu, with cinematography by Christopher Doyle and starring Luo Ruoying shared the same English title. = Novel = * In 2007, Lisa See's novel Peony in Love was published by Random House.

It was established in 1960 by the Wisconsin Province of the Society of Jesus. Sogang is the oldest Catholic and Jesuit institution of higher education in South Korea. HistoryBeginnings= At the initiative of the Catholic Hierarchy of Korea, Pope Pius XII gave assurance that a Catholic institution of higher learning would be established in Korea. In 1948 he entrusted the task to the Society of Jesus. In October 1954 Jesuit Fr. Theodore Geppert, SJ from Sophia University of Tokyo came to Korea in search of a suitable site to establish a Jesuit college. In February 1955 Jean-Baptiste Janssens, SJ, the twenty-seventh Superior General of the Society of Jesus, assigned the task of establishing the college to the Wisconsin Province of Jesuits. Fr. Leo Burns, SJ, Superior of the Wisconsin Province of the Society of Jesus, came to Korea and, with the Korean Catholic Hierarchy, began negotiations with the Syngman Rhee government for the establishment of a liberal arts college. In January 1957 the Society of Jesus purchased a property of 67,075 pyong (217,323 sq. meters, 53 acres) at Nogosan, Sinsu-dong, Mapo-gu, Seoul. The site was prepared for construction of an Administration Building, which was completed in November 1959. Sogang College was opened in 1960 and was granted university status in 1970. =Development= The 1979 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Mother Teresa visited Sogang in May 1981 and gave addresses in the auditorium and at the basketball court, appealing for all to practice a charity that is universal. In 1984 the Korean Catholic Church celebrated its bicentennial. For the celebration Pope John Paul II visited Korea on May 5, meeting with priests along with men and women religious in the gymnasium and with Korean intellectuals in the auditorium.A Sogang University campus building On April 24, 1985, Sogang's 25th anniversary was commemorated, with Sogang's founder Fr. Geppert, SJ as a special guest. University Symbol and Slogan The cardinal red university color symbolizes love, the Holy Spirit, martyrdom, loyalty, and victory. The silver chevron comes from the first letter '„ÖÖ' of ÏÑúÍ∞ï (Sogang), representing the intellectual spirit of Sogang and an ivory tower. The \\"IHS\\" comes from the first letters of the Greek name for Jesus and is also found on the seal of the Society of Jesus, the Catholic religious order that founded the University. The medieval crown stands for the Virgin and Trinity, symbolizing wisdom. Sogang University also has a famous slogan which is: Be as Proud of Sogang as Sogang is Proud of You. (Í∑∏ÎåÄ ÏÑúÍ∞ïÏùò ÏûêÎûëÏù¥ÎìØ, ÏÑúÍ∞ï Í∑∏ÎåÄÏùò ÏûêÎûëÏù¥Ïñ¥Îùº) Reputation Admission to Sogang University is highly selective and competitive in South Korea. Sogang's freshman intake belongs to the top 1% of their high school academic performance in the country, and the university is widely regarded as the top private university and one of the most prestigious elite schools in South Korea. However, the university's ranking lags behind its reputation and evaluation results because it has no medical school and fewer students than some other Korean universities. =Rankings= *QS World University Ranking 2018 #441-450 *QS WUR By Subject Ranking 2018 Modern Languages #151-200 Linguistics #151-200 Business & Management Studies #151-200 Engineering - Chemical #151-200 Arts and Humanities #197 Social Sciences and Management #=213 English Language and Literature #201-250 Economics and Econometrics #201-250 Engineering - Mechanical #201-250 Engineering - Electrical and Electronic #251-300 Physics & Astronomy #251-300 Engineering and Technology #=276 Computer Science and information System #301-350 Natural Sciences #401-450 Chemistry #401-450 *QS Graduate Employability Ranking 2018 #301-500 *QS Asian University Rankings 2018 #57 =Sogang Business School= In October 2009 Sogang University received accreditation in business from the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) .MBA Channel: South Korea on the rise It is among the top five business schools in Korea.

Some faculty members have been deeply involved in the design of Korea's economic development program through top-level cabinet positions in the government. Due to these important engagements, a group of economists affiliated with the University and engaged in policy-making came to be called the \\"Sogang School.\\" Based on its reputation, the School has consistently attracted young talent of the highest caliber, mostly from the top 1% in the national college entrance exam. Reflecting its excellent research capacity, the Economics Department has been recognized by RePEc as near the top in Korea in international journal publications.  Sogang Korean Language Education Center  Sogang Korean Language Education Center (KLEC) was established in 1990 with the goal to popularize and spread the Korean language and Korean culture throughout the world. Since its establishment, over 30,000 students from overseas have learned about Korean culture and language by participating in its programs. Currently, an average of 3,500 students register for the Korean Language Education Center every year.

The 41st Infantry Brigade Combat Team (\\"Sunset\\") is an element in the Oregon Army National Guard. Headquartered at Camp Withycombe, Clackamas, Oregon, it was part of the 7th Infantry Division based at Ft. Carson in Colorado (inactivated in 2006). The brigade traces its lineage back to the 41st Infantry Division. History Owing to the deployment of active duty troops to the intensifying Vietnam War, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara established the Selected Reserve Force, composed of Army National Guard units authorized at a full wartime strength of almost 4,500 men and given increased priority for the receipt of new equipment so that they could be mobilized within a week. In return, such units had an increased number of drilling days. The 41st Infantry Division, split between the Washington and Oregon Army National Guard, was among those selected to contribute units to the force and on 15 November 1965 subordinate units of it were withdrawn from it to form the 41st Infantry Brigade. The brigade included two Washington (the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 161st Infantry) and one Oregon (the 1st Battalion, 162nd Infantry) infantry battalions. Oregon provided the brigade headquarters at Portland, the brigade armored cavalry reconnaissance troop (Troop E, 82nd Cavalry), the field artillery (2nd Battalion, 218th Artillery), engineers (162nd Engineer Company) and the administration company (Company A, 141st Support Battalion). Washington provided the remainder of the 141st Support Battalion and the brigade aviation company. The remaining units of the 41st Infantry Division contributed men to bring those selected for the brigade up to strength, reducing them from 60% to 50% of authorized TO&E; strength. The headquarters of the 1st Brigade of the 41st Infantry Division was reorganized to form the brigade headquarters, leaving it with two brigades. In 1968, the 41st Infantry Brigade was redesignated as the 41st Separate Infantry Brigade, located primarily within the Oregon Army National Guard. In 1975 the brigade became the \\"roundout brigade\\" to the 7th Infantry Division, serving this capacity until August 2006. In 1994, the 41st Separate Infantry Brigade was designated as \\"Enhanced\\" and in 1998 was selected as one of three SIB's assigned to the 7th Infantry Division (Light). In 1999, 136 members of Company C, 2nd Battalion, 162nd Infantry and Company B, 1st Battalion, 186th Infantry were called up to active duty to protect Patriot missile batteries in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait as part of Operation Southern Watch. On 11 September 2001, advance elements of the 241st Military Intelligence Company arrived in Tuzla, Bosnia, for a seven- month deployment as part of the NATO Stabilization Force.http://www.oregon.gov/OMD/PressRelease/2001/8-27-01Press.shtmlhttp://www.oregon.gov/OMD/PressRelease/2002/4-11-02Press.shtml 1st Battalion, 162nd Infantry was deployed 6 February 2003 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, the first unit in 41st Brigade to deploy to combat operations since World War II. Several months after 1st Battalion, 162nd Infantry deployed to Iraq, 2nd Battalion, 162nd Infantry deployed as part of the 39th Infantry Brigade (Enhanced) (Arkansas National Guard) to Iraq. The battalion served in Baghdad and other parts of Iraq, suffering a number of casualties while conducting stabilization security missions. During the same time, a handful of personnel were sent to train foreign soldiers in Afghanistan. The 2nd Platoon of Company B, 2nd Battalion, 162nd Infantry was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for their gallantry in combat, the first award of the Presidential Unit Citation to an Oregon National Guard unit since World War II.http://schrader.house.gov/news/documentprint.aspx?DocumentID=322761http://www.oregon.gov/omd/pages/pressrelease/2011/01-09-11bpress.aspx The Presidential Unit Citation reads: \\"On 3 November 2004, the unit was placed under the operational control of the 1st Regimental Combat Team of the 1st Marine Division, to execute offensive operations in the central Iraqi city of Fallujah. The unit was selected for the initial attack on the city and tasked with penetrating the enemy's defenses and isolating the Jolan District in northwestern Fallujah. The Jolan District was believed to be the strongest of the enemy's defenses. The unit's rapid penetration deep into the city overwhelmed enemy positions, leading the way for further exploitation by the Marines. Throughout the remainder of the battle, the unit continued to isolate western Fallujah while attacking and destroying numerous enemy strong points. The unit's heroic Soldiers, and their expert use of combined arms firepower, led to the destruction of the insurgents in Fallujah.\\" In September, 2005, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Brigadier General Douglas Pritt commanded the majority of the brigade as part of Task Force Oregon in relief and security efforts near the French Quarter in New Orleans. By the end of the month, when Hurricane Rita wreaked havoc again on the Gulf Coast, the 41st was put in charge of the newly designated Joint Task Force Rita to assist in all disaster-related needs in Texas and Louisiana. In the spring of 2006, Brig. Gen. Pritt and elements of the brigade joined the personnel already in Afghanistan, making the total force approximately 950 soldiers. In 2006 the brigade was redesignated to officially become the 41 Infantry Brigade Combat Team. The 41st Infantry Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) mobilized to Iraq, under the command of Colonel Daniel R. Hokanson, in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom from 2009 to 2010. The Brigade conducted convoy security for the 13th Expeditionary Sustainment Command and base defense operations across Iraq including Anbar province, Baghdad, and southern Iraq. It was the largest mobilization of Oregon National Guard troops since the 41st Infantry Division mobilized for World War II.

The celebration features Bus√≥s (people wearing traditional masks) and includes folk music, masquerading, parades and dancing. Bus√≥j√°r√°s lasts six days, usually during February. It starts on a Thursday, followed by the Kisfarsang (Little Farsang) carnival on Friday, with the biggest celebration, Farsang vas√°rnap (Farsang Sunday) on the seventh Sunday before Easter Sunday; the celebration then ends with Farsangtemet√©s (Burial of Farsang) on the following Tuesday (Shrove Tuesday or Mardi Gras).

Bus√≥ festivities at Moh√°cs: masked end-of-winter carnival custom. Description and decision at the UNESCO's website. Accessed on 11 January 2013. Locals explain the Carnival with two related but different legends. According to the most popular legend, during the Ottoman times of the territory, people from Moh√°cs fled the town, and started living in the nearby swamps and woods to avoid Ottoman (Turkish) troops. One night, while they were sitting and talking around the fire, an old ≈†okac man appeared suddenly from nowhere, and said to them: \\"Don't be afraid, your lives will soon turn to good and you'll return to your homes. Until that time, prepare for the battle, carve various weapons and scary masks for yourselves, and wait for a stormy night when a masked knight will come to you.\\" He disappeared as suddenly as he arrived. The refugees followed his orders, and some days later, on a stormy night, the knight arrived. He ordered them to put on their masks and go back to Moh√°cs, making as much noise as possible. They followed his lead. The Turks were so frightened by the noise, the masks, and the storm in the night, that they thought demons were attacking them, and they ran away from the town before sunrise. In the older, less popular story, the bus√≥s are scaring away not the Turks but Winter itself. In any case, the locals have celebrated the Bus√≥j√°r√°s in early February every year ever since, hosting \\"guest Bus√≥ teams\\" from neighbouring countries (Croatia and Serbia, local ≈†okci Croats and Slovenia) and also from Poland.

Established in 1865 in what was then Barber's Creek, it is the oldest surviving single-teacher schoolhouse in Australia. Workers on the Great Southern Railway were engaged in building a viaduct at Barber's Creek, and since the nearest government school was five miles away at Marulan, they built the schoolhouse. In July 1865, 75 persons signed a petition to the National Board of Education, requesting that the board pay the salary of a teacher whom they had already hired; the parents paid fees to the teacher but could not afford an adequate salary. The railway ensured the survival of the village (renamed Tallong in 1906) and during the steam era and the advent of the motor era, when other small towns were folding, the school at Tallong was sometimes the only education available in the area. As of 2004, the school averaged about 40 students per term. Specialist teachers visit the school during the week to instruct students in subjects such as music and science.

As of May 2019, the TEU employs 56 transit enforcement officers (TEOs), and 63 transit fare inspectors (TFIs). History TTC constables in Bloor‚ÄìYonge station Police Interceptor Before the creation of the TEU, security on the TTC was limited to random patrols by Toronto police officers, and the TTC Corporate Security Department to provide in-house security relating to property offences. Since July of 1987, the TTC employed staff designated provincial offences officers, responsible for the enforcement of TTC by-laws, responding to calls for service, and protecting TTC employees, customers, and assets. Ten years later, in June 1997, the Toronto Police Services Board, with the approval of the Solicitor General, designated the employees responsible for safety and security as \\"special constables\\" under Section 53 of the Police Services Act. The designation was governed by a contractual relationship between the TTC and the Toronto Police Services Board. In 2009, the Toronto Police Service created a Transit Patrol Unit (TPU) to patrol the subway system and to provide direction and assistance to TEOs. In 2010, the Special Constable Services Department officers lost special constable status after allegations they were exceeding their authority. The agreement with the Toronto Police Service was officially terminated in February 2011. In September, the TTC reorganized the department and renamed it the Transit Enforcement Unit. Prior to the reorganization, the department was composed of three sections: Transit Enforcement, Investigative services, and System Security. In 2014, the TEU regained special constable status.  Operations  The Transit Enforcement Unit has four sections: * Patrol (special constables) * Fare Inspection (fare inspectors) * System Security (special constables and protective services guards / supervisors) * Training and Logistical Support (special constables and fare inspectors) = Jurisdiction = Transit Enforcement Officers  TEOs are sworn as special constables by the Toronto Police Services Board under the Police Services Act, granting them limited police powers. They have the same powers as a police officer to enforce the Criminal Code, the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the Liquor Licence Act, and the Trespass to Property Act. Specifically, TEOs: # have powers and obligations of a peace officer under ss. 495 to 497 of the Criminal Code and subsections 495(3) and 497(3) of that Act, apply to the special constable as if he/she is a peace officer, # have powers of a police officer for the purposes of ss. 16, and 17 of the Mental Health Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.7, as amended, # have powers of a police officer for the purposes of ss.31(5), 36(1), 47(1) and (1.1), and 48 of the Liquor Licence Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.19, as amended, # have powers of a police officer for the purposes of ss. 9 of the Trespass to Property Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. T.21, as amended, and # are designated as provincial offences officers for the purposes of enforcement of the Liquor License Act, Trespass to Property Act and TTC By-law No. 1. TEOs are also designated as agents/occupiers of the TTC.  Transit fare inspectors  TFIs are designated as provincial offences officers for the purpose of enforcing TTC By-law No. 1, and the Trespass to Property Act. =Deployment= The Mobile Patrol Division members were the visible presence on TTC surface vehicles while the Subway Patrol Division members were the visible presence in the subway system. They wore uniforms distinct from the standard TTC or Toronto Police uniforms; consisting of a black jacket and powder blue shirt with a special constables crest on both shoulders and black cargo pants. They were armed with batons and OC foam (pepper spray in a less aerosol form to avoid contamination in confined places), body armour and carried portable radios. Some officers patrolled the subway system on foot, while others drove in marked or unmarked vehicles, responding to calls on surface routes and in the subway. =Cancellation and revival of the special constable program= On June 18, 2009, the Toronto Police Services board voted unanimously to take control of the TTC special constables. Negotiations between the Toronto Police Service and the TTC on how to proceed took place for over a year before the Police Services Board decided to wind down the organization. One of the main objections that led to this decision was the fact that constables are not armed, and any time there is a situation with a firearm involved, they are not equipped to respond and must wait for police. There were also concerns regarding the constables overstepping their jurisdiction when it came to criminal investigations, and a lack of civilian oversight. In a newspaper interview, Alok Mukherjee, the chair of the Police Services Board, was quoted as saying \\"We were creating more than one public police (force) paid by the public taxpayer, without the oversight, without the accountability, without the monitoring.... The core business of the TTC is to run the transit system and the core business of the Toronto Police Service is to provide policing. So I think it was a rational decision.\\" On October 21, 2010, the Toronto Police Services Board voted in favour of the cancellation of the special constable program effective February 1, 2011. At the same time, the board approved the expansion of the Toronto Police Transit Patrol Unit. It is expected that the existing special constables will become bylaw enforcement officers, tasked primarily with fare evasion and by-law offences. Andy Byford, the CEO of the TTC, requested in October 2013 that the Toronto Police Services Board restore the special constable program in an effort to implement an independent complaints process and public awareness campaign. In 2014, the TEU regained special constable status. Policing issues According to the 2008 Annual Report to the Transit Commission, the special constables were involved in 1215 arrests, and laid approximately 450 charges during the calendar year ending December 31, 2008. During that period, over 6000 occurrence reports were filed regarding incidents that did not involve arrests or charges. Transit fare inspectors and proof-of-payment The Transit Enforcement Unit employs approximately 64 transit fare inspectors, who conduct fare inspections and enforce fares on designated proof-of-payment routes (either on board the vehicles, or at terminal/interchange stations). The inspectors are dressed in white uniforms, with a \\"Fare Inspector\\" banner on the back. This unit was launched in August 2014, when the new Flexity low-floor streetcars entered service on street car lines. All streetcar lines use an honour system where passengers pay their fare using electronic fare machines or by using the Presto fare system. Transit fare inspectors will then inspect passengers while on a vehicle, exiting a vehicle, or at subway stations.

Overview The importance of Fuchs' life achievement must surely be based on his discovery and description of numerous ocular diseases and abnormalities. As a result of more than 250 scientific publications, the name Ernst Fuchs became well known throughout the world. Although his name is commonly recognized in conjunction with various corneal and anterior segment disorders, Ernst Fuchs' contribution to ophthalmology exceeds purely the delineation of ocular diseases and the detailed description of signs. Fuchs' collection of microscopic samples laid the foundation for anatomical and pathological understanding of blood vessels, muscles, and most other tissues of the eye. Additionally, Fuchs was able to pass on his unique knowledge, educating ophthalmologists at an international level. His Textbook of Ophthalmology was, for many decades, the most extensively used reference book in the field of ophthalmology worldwide. Fuchs' Textbook of Ophthalmology was first published in 1889. During the following 21 years, he edited 12 of the 18 English editions of the textbook himself. The Textbook of Ophthalmology was translated into numerous languages (including Japanese, Chinese, Spanish, French, Russian, and Italian). Between 1892 and 1933, 10 British and American editions were published. Later versions were edited by Maximilian Salzmann, his oldest pupil. In America as well as the Far East, the textbook was considered the bible of ophthalmology for approximately 50 years. The final edition was published in 1945 in German. Other books about normal and pathological anatomy have evolved from Fuchs' textbook. During his period of clinical practice and education, Austria and particularly Vienna became the centre of ophthalmology worldwide. Fuchs' success was not limited to Austria, but he was known globally and his works were published in Japanese, Chinese and German languages. Fuchs also had many international patients, including the wife of Naser al-Din, the Qajar Shah of Persia and a group of his entourage, who came to Fuchs for treatment of cataracts. International Recognition Fuchs was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons (Edinburgh) in 1905.

Budapest's music history has included the composers Franz Liszt, Ern≈ë Dohn√°nyi, Zolt√°n Kod√°ly and B√©la Bart√≥k and the opera composer Ferenc Erkel. Hungary, especially Budapest has a rich musical culture, whether its classical music, modern experimental, electronica, alternative music, or traditional Hungarian folk music. Classical music Music institutions in modern Budapest include the Hungarian State Opera, the Hungarian State Orchestra and the Nemzeti Filharm√≥nia. Music festivals in Budapest include the annual folk dance celebration T√°nch√°ztal√°lkoz√≥ and the Budapest Festival Orchestra. Music venues include the Alm√°ssy Square Leisure Centre, Franz Liszt Academy of Music and Pet≈ëfi Hall. =Hungarian National Philharmonic= The story of the National Philharmonic Orchestra began in 1923, with the formation of the Metropolitan Orchestra, which quickly became one of the pillars of Hungarian musical life. In the past few years, the orchestra has received a remarkable number of invitations to perform abroad. They have enjoyed immense success at venues as far apart as the New York Avery Fisher Hall, the Tokyo Suntory Hall, the Birmingham Symphony Hall, the Athenian Megaron Musicos or the Colmar Festival. ConcertoNet, the distinguished online classical music journal, nominated the orchestra's concert in New York in February 2003 as the winner of the Lully Prize for the best concert of the season. Under the artistic direction of Zolt√°n Kocsis, is undertaking in a complete Bart√≥k recording project for the Hungaroton label, launched in 2006. The first recordings from this new series was released in December 2006 under the title the Kossuth Symphony and The Wooden Prince. This SACD received important international critical acclaim (Diapason d'or, Pizzicato Supersonic Prize etc.). The second one was released in September 2007 with a new recording of the Violin Concerto op. posth. and earlier recordings of Rhapsody op. 1 and Scherzo op. 2. On 1 December 2006,the Hungarian National Philharmonic was appointed Hungarian Goodwill Ambassador of UNICEF by its Hungarian National Committee. Their performances can be seen at the Palace of the Arts =Danube Symphony Orchestra with cimbalom= Outside Hungary it may sound unusual to include a folk instrument in the performance of a symphonic orchestra, but this unique instrument has a long tradition of accompanying classical music. The Danube Symphony Orchestra was founded in 1961. And since then they have performed numerous times both in Hungary and abroad. Their repertoire covers almost all musical styles from Baroque music to the music of the 20th century. They perform famous classical pieces with a unique Hungarian twist, the Cimbalom (Hammer Dulcimer). Their performance offers a unique opportunity to hear the most popular masterpieces of classical music interpreted by the cimbalom and a symphonic orchestra in a way which can be enjoyed only in Hungary. Besides their permanent conductor Andr√°s De√°k, they are often conducted by other Hungarian and foreign conductors. They have performed in Germany, France, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Italy. Their \\"home\\" however is the world- famous Danube Palace in the heart of downtown Budapest. The cimbalom The cimbalom is played primarily with beaters. It is equipped with a heavy frame for more dynamic power and many added string courses for an extended range of sounds and a damper pedal to allow more dynamic control. =Folk Music= Some of the most important performers and preservers of traditional Hungarian folk music, dancing and costume culture are three main Folk Ensembles of Hungary, the State Folk Emsemble, the Hungaria Folk Ensemble, that continues on the tradition of the Rajk√≥ Emsemble, and the Danube Folk Ensemble. Hungarian State Folk Ensemble During the more than five decades of its existence, the Ensemble has been working tirelessly at revitalizing the Hungarian folk culture. Because of their rich and colourful repertoire the State Ensemble is regarded as one of the top touring folk art groups in the world. It has performed in 44 countries across four continents and won the admiration of an audience of more than seven and a half million people. In the last few decades the Ensemble gained special interest in the United States and Canada‚Äîthey were invited to undertake a three-month coast to coast American tour in 1994. They have also toured the Far East and Western Europe. The Ensemble consists of 30 dancers, 14 members of the Gipsy Orchestra and 5 members of the Hungarian Folk Orchestra. The choreographies are all based on authentic dances, some of them were collected in isolated villages with dance elements dating back hundreds of years. The extraordinary folk music that inspired Liszt, Bart√≥k and Kod√°ly is put on stage by both the Folk Orchestra and the world-famous Gipsy Orchestra. The 5 members of the Folk Orchestra play authentic, traditional instruments and perform Hungarian folk music at its highest artistic level. The famous Gipsy Orchestra accompanies dancers as well as performs alone. Their rich repertoire includes folk music that inspired Hungarian and international classical composers such as Liszt, Brahms, Kod√°ly and Bart√≥k. Aside from its performances around the country and abroad, the Ensemble gives approximately 90‚Äì100 performances annually at its home theatre at Corvin t√©r, the Budai Vigad√≥ or Hungarian Heritage House.  Hung√°ria Folk Ensemble (formerly known as Rajk√≥ Folk Ensemble)  The Hung√°ria Orchestra and Folk Ensemble, this is probably the most popular of the ensembles at home and especially abroad. They stand apart from the other two groups because they showcase elements of traditional Roma culture along with Hungarian folk music, dance and costume culture. This company was established in 1952. Their gift was born from the traditions of century old gipsy dynasties. The exceptional professional skills of the Hung√°ria are due to a special educational method that concentrates on preserving their natural aptitude for improvisation an essential precondition of virtuosity. The Hung√°ria Orchestra and Folk Ensemble performs as many musical and dance groups. The fifty plus main orchestra and the six to eight splinter chamber groups are equally celebrated guests at the world‚Äôs most prestigious venues. They are also adept at accompanying well known soloists and dance ensembles. The incredible range of their repertoire covers many genres from classical to folk music, from operettas to, of course gipsy music. They have enjoyed success throughout Europe, North and South America, Australia and Far East where they have thrilled and fascinated audiences. They have often appeared on National Television and Radio and have a number of acclaimed recordings. The Hung√°ria Folk Ensemble has an equally high reputation. This fiery young group of about sixty dancers was formed 50 years ago. They specialise in Hungarian folk dance but are equally able to perform operettas, ballet, and modern dance. The high professional attainment of the dancers is largely due to eight to ten years of intense training which begins at a very early age. They are true professionals dedicated to achieving the very highest standards of their craft.  Danube Folk Ensemble  Founded in 1957, the Danube Folk Ensemble is one of the most highly regarded professional musical and dance groups in Hungary. The Ensemble consists of 24 professional dancers and 5 musicians. The Duna Dance Workshop, working with the Duna Art Ensemble, give theatrical interpretations of the Hungarian folk dance, leaving room for creative experimentation. The G√∂nc√∂l Orchestra also gives individual concerts based on authentic folk music. The ensemble's goal is to perform genuine dances with dynamism and style, and to create innovative dance-theatre pieces on these principles. In addition to establishing a distinctive style through the vision of their artistic director, Zsolt Juh√°sz, the ensemble regularly works together with noted guest choreographers. The Danube Folk Ensemble's repertoire includes gems of Hungarian folk dance tradition, while Hungarian folk music is faithfully interpreted by its musicians. Varied and broad, the repertoire provides for several unique concerts. The ensemble gives over one hundred performances each year, including weekly shows at the Duna Palota and folklore and dance-theatre performances both in the theatres of Budapest and all over the country. Besides presenting its own repertoire, the ensemble has participated in various theatre productions such as J√°nos Vit√©z‚Äîa musical tale, King Stephen, Attila‚Äîrock operas and the opera D√≥zsa Gy√∂rgy. Their performances are often included at celebrations on national holidays. In the last 20 years the ensemble performed in England, Cuba, Poland, Australia, France, at the Sevilla Expo, in Finland, Romania, Austria, Switzerland and Italy. The Hungarian State Folk Ensemble, the Danube Folk Ensemble and the Rajk√≥ Folk Ensemble (founded in 1951, 1957 and 1952 respectively) are the three of the best Hungarian folk ensembles with the longest tradition in Hungary. They regularly give performances both in Hungary and abroad. Each ensemble consists of 30 artists. Ethnic and world musicBudapest Klezmer Band= Klezmer music originates from the Ashkenazi Jews of Eastern Europe. The Budapest Klezmer Band, founded in 1990 They play musical arrangements, composed by the founder and musical director of the ensemble, Ferenc J√°vori. J√°vori learned and played klezmer with the last surviving musicians from a once flourishing community where klezmer music was an integral part of Jewish life. Other members of the band are also highly regarded musicians, having graduated from the Franz Liszt Academy of Music of Budapest. The Band also takes part in theatrical productions. They are featured in the ballet production PURIM, The Casting of Fate, and in Fiddler on the Roof at the Mad√°ch Theater in Budapest. Their performances with the famous Franz Liszt Chamber Orchestra playing at the Academy of Music in Budapest were successful and were called an important step towards bringing klezmer music to the classical concert hall. In 2000 the Pro Cultura Foundation of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences awarded the Kod√°ly Zolt√°n Cultural Prize to the Budapest Klezmer Band for promoting and spreading Yiddish musical tradition, and in August 2003 the band was awarded the Artisjus Prize. =Roma MusicAndo Drom= In 1993 Jen≈ë Zsig√≥ created the Ando Drom Foundation, for the purpose of promoting Romany art, helping to motivate young talent, and to allow the Romany encounter their own culture within the community, through the productions of the band Ando Drom, among others, a group pioneering the reinterpretation of Romany music and dance.

Its programs focus on the prevention of blindness and the treatment of blinding eye diseases in developing countries through hands-on training, public health education, advocacy and local partnerships. Since 1982, Orbis capacity-building programs have enhanced the skills of 325,000 eye care personnel and provided medical and optical treatment to more than 23.3 million people in 92 countries. Orbis is a registered 501(c)(3) tax-deductible non-profit charity in the United States. It is rated 4 stars on Charity Navigator and is a Guidestar Gold Participant. It is headquartered in New York, with offices in Toronto, London, Dublin, Hong Kong, Macau, Shanghai, Singapore and Cape Town. Orbis' programs emphasise skills, training and self-sufficiency. The organisation spends approximately a year planning and coordinating with partner hospitals and local organisations, making preliminary visits to observe the local medical teams. The Flying Eye Hospital not only provides training, but also equipment and surgical supplies to ensure that the local medical teams are equipped with skills and supplies long after the flying eye hospital has left the program site. It ensures that other patients who are in need of treatment are able to get the treatment even after the hospital has departed. Cybersight, Orbis' telemedicine program, continues the training and mentoring relationships even after the Flying Eye Hospital has left the program site. Orbis' intervention are tailored to local needs; Orbis trains local doctors in low-tech, low-cost yet effective methods to correct diseases of the eyes. In addition to the Flying Eye Hospital, Orbis operates hospital-based programs in several countries and works with local medical research and health-care organizations on blindness prevention and eye disease treatment. Orbis is a founding partner, along with the World Health Organization, of VISION 2020: The Right to Sight, \\"a worldwide concerted effort designed to eliminate avoidable blindness by the year 2020.\\"  History  Orbis was founded in 1982 with a grant from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and a number of private donors. The first Flying Eye Hospital was a Douglas DC-8-21 (N220RB) donated by United Airlines. In its first two years of operation, the Orbis DC-8 visited 24 countries and held programs emphasizing the hands-on transfer of surgical skills. By the late 1980s, as replacement parts for the aging DC-8 became more difficult and expensive to obtain, it became clear that a newer, larger aircraft was needed. Funded by private donations, Orbis purchased a DC-10 in 1992. The DC-10 contained twice the interior space of the original DC-8. After two years of conversion and renovation, it was placed in service in 1994, and the DC-8 was retired and donated to Chinese Aviation Museum near Beijing. That summer, the new Flying Eye Hospital took off on its inaugural mission to Beijing, China. In 1998, Orbis embarked on a new path based on the strategy to strengthen the capacity of local partners in the developing world to prevent and treat blindness through full-time, ongoing in- country programs. These programs were designed to respond to the needs of individual ophthalmic communities and local eye care providers. Orbis selected the first initial five countries to work in year round based on need (magnitude of blindness), opportunity (local infrastructure and resources), and safety & stability to operate in-country. Orbis launched its first permanent country program in Ethiopia. Country programs in Bangladesh, China, India and Vietnam soon followed. In 2010 Orbis established a country program office in South Africa. Permanent Orbis offices in these countries, run by local staff, develop and implement an array of multi-year projects to improve the quality and accessibility of eye care to residents, particularly in rural area and impoverished urban communities. In addition to permanent country offices, Orbis also engages in long-term program work in several countries in Latin America and the Caribbean as well is in countries including Nepal, Zambia, and Burkina Faso. On April 7, 2008, Orbis announced it would replace the DC-10 Flying Eye Hospital with a DC-10 Series 30 freighter. United Airlines, with the support of FedEx, is donating the airplane to Orbis. The $2 million donation is based on the plane's estimated value and is being funded equally by United and FedEx. On August 8, 2011, FedEx announced that it would donate one of its DC-10-30s, retrofitted with the MD-10-30F upgrade, to Orbis to replace its DC-10-30F. The new MD-10 will feature a modular hospital suite, the first time these units will have been used on an aircraft. In 2012, Orbis Celebrated its 30th Anniversary of Saving Sight Worldwide.  The Orbis Flying Eye Hospital  Orbis International McDonnell-Douglas DC-10-10 at Hong Kong Orbis is well known for its \\"Flying Eye Hospital,\\" an ophthalmic hospital and teaching facility located on board a DC-10 aircraft. The Flying Eye Hospital brings training to doctors and nurses in developing countries with little access to professional development and training. Classrooms, operating theatres and laser rooms are aboard the plane and the local medical personnel are able to watch live surgeries as well as simulations. 3D filming and broadcast facilities allow the local ophthalmic professionals to observe the live surgeries through the eyes of the surgeon. Surgeries can also be broadcast to additional classes outside of the aircraft, be it a local hospital or halfway across the world. Participants can ask questions via a two-way audio-visual system. Volunteer pilots donate their time and skills to fly the hospital to the various program sites.Examination and laser treatment suite inside the Flying Eye Hospital In June 2016, Orbis revealed its third- generation Flying Eye Hospital. The hospital is a converted McDonnell Douglas DC-10 donated by FedEx and can fly twice as long as its predecessor. It is similar to a land-based hospital and is outfitted with safety features such as a back-up generator and early alert monitoring systems. The hospital also has its own water treatment plant and air conditioning systems. It also houses a 46-seat classroom, sterilization room and operating room and uses 3D technology and live broadcast systems which allow local participants to observe surgeries while they are taking place. A virtual tour of the plane was created as part of the launch which enables users to virtually explore all areas of the plane including the operating room and cargo hold. Orbis's previous DC-10-10, which was the oldest flying example of its type by then, has since been donated to the Pima Air & Space Museum. It arrived at Davis‚ÄìMonthan Air Force Base in November 2016 and is currently under restoration.  Country programs  In addition to the Flying Eye Hospital, operates long-term country programs and collaborates with local governments and organisations and push for eye care to be integrated into national health programs. It has also worked with local universities and healthcare institutions and manage a team of more than 400 medical volunteers from 29 countries to provide expert training to their local partners. In each country, Orbis works with its local partner institutions to increase their capacity to provide comprehensive, affordable and sustainable eye care services over the long term. The programs include developing specialized hospital facilities, eye banks, patient and health care worker training, and prevention and treatment programs. In 2015 alone, more than 30,000 medical professionals were trained and more than 2 million patients were examined either on board Flying Eye Hospital or at its partner institutions.  Cybersight  Cybersight is a telemedicine portal that allows eye health workers in low- and middle-income countries to consult with expert mentors in their field, free of charge. Mentors give their opinion on patient cases, share learning materials, and help local eye health workers develop their skills in blindness treatment and prevention. Since its launch, more than 10,000 electronic cases have taken place. This allows for distance learning and discussion, and ensures that the local medical teams of the various program sites are able to benefit from Orbis' services even after the Flying Eye Hospital has left the site. Cybersight also offers regular live lectures, a library of educational material, and allows users to take tests and receive certificates of achievement. On September 10, 2018, Orbis announced a new collaboration with AI company Visulytix to apply their automated imaging technology to Cybersight. Visulytix's Pegasus AI system will be used to analyse images of the back of the eye taken with any standard retina camera or smartphone. Eye doctors in low-resource countries will be amongst the first in the world to have free access to this service on the Cybersight platform, helping them detect and diagnose sight-threatening eye diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma, as well as quickly request a second opinion from Orbis‚Äôs network of medical experts.

He began his career directing short travelogue documentaries, starting with April in Portugal in 1954 (not released until 1956). He worked in publicity, giving away Anita Ekberg at her wedding to Anthony Steel. Lloyd befriended Alan Ladd while making The Red Beret (1953) and Ladd gained Lloyd a job on production for Warwick Productions. He worked for that company for a number of years, then went to work for Carl Foreman. Lloyd's first credit as producer came when Richard Widmark, with whom he had made A Prize of Gold (1955), asked him to co produce The Secret Ways (1961). He went on to produce The Poppy Is Also a Flower (1966), Murderer's Row (1966), and westerns such as Shalako (1968) Catlow (1971) and The Man Called Noon (1973). Lloyd obtained finance from international sources. In the 1970s, Lloyd went independent, but his first effort, Paper Tiger (1975), was not a success, although he said it was probably his favourite picture.The Last of the Gentleman Producers at YouTube He put everything he had behind the $10 million action film The Wild Geese (1978). He followed with The Sea Wolves, (1980) starring Roger Moore, David Niven and Gregory Peck and Who Dares Wins (1982). His last film was Wild Geese II (1985) starring Scott Glenn and Laurence Olivier. Lloyd appeared in the short documentary The Last of the Gentleman Producers which accompanied the 2004 release of The Wild Geese on DVD, and also contributed to the audio commentary alongside Roger Moore and film editor/second unit director John Glen.

He played all or parts of 10 seasons in Major League Baseball, primarily for the Cincinnati Reds in the National League (1878‚Äì1879) and the Cincinnati Red Stockings in the American Association (1882‚Äì1886). He had three 40-win, and one 40-loss, seasons in Cincinnati. During the 1882 and 1883 seasons, he led the American Association in wins, compiling an 83‚Äì34 win‚Äìloss record and a 1.84 earned run average (ERA). Over the course of 10 major league seasons, White compiled a 229‚Äì166 record with a 2.28 ERA. His career ERA ranks ninth on the all-time list of Major League Baseball career ERA leaders. White also set a number of major league pitching records and still holds several. His 1879 totals of 75 complete games, 75 games started, 680 innings pitched, and 2,906 batters faced remain major league records. He was also the player-manager of the Red Stockings for 71 games during the 1884 season, compiling a 44‚Äì27 managerial record. He is also remembered as the first, and for many years only, major league player to wear eyeglasses on the baseball field. Early years White was born in 1854 in the town of Caton in Steuben County, New York. His parents were Lester White (born ), a farmer, and his wife, Adeline (born ). The couple had at least eight children: Oscar Leroy (born ), James (born 1847), Melville (born ), William, Phebe Davis (born ), Estelle (born ), George (born ) and Hattie (born ); they also adopted a girl named Phebe Maynard (born ) when they were in their fifties. White's ancestors likely immigrated to America during the colonial period.The 1880 census indicated that all his grandparents were born in New York or Pennsylvania, likely in the 1780s or early 1790s given his parents' ages. White's older brother, Deacon White White came from a baseball- playing family. When he was age 13, his older brother, Deacon White, began playing professional baseball; Deacon was eventually inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. His cousin, Elmer White, played in the major leagues in 1871, while Will was 16, and died in 1872 at age 21. At least one account indicates that White was also related to Warren White, a native of Milton, New York, who played in the major leagues from 1871 to 1875. Professional baseballMinor leagues= Records of White's early years in organized baseball during the mid-1870s are scarce. In an 1892 account on \\"The History of Base Ball Pitching\\", The Sporting Life wrote that White was \\"about the first\\" pitcher to develop \\"the sharp curve ball\\", doing so in 1875. During the 1876 season, White reportedly pitched for the Binghamton Crickets, where John Kelly was his catcher. =Boston= In 1877, White's older brother, Deacon White, was playing at first base for the Boston Red Caps of the National League. Deacon, by then an established veteran, brought Will with him to Boston for a tryout. Will was given a three-game tryout with the Red Caps, making his major league debut on July 20, 1877, at age 22. He pitched three complete games and compiled a 2‚Äì1 record and a 3.00 earned run average (ERA) in 27 innings pitched. During White's tryout with the Red Caps, Deacon and Will White \\"formed the first brother battery in the game.\\" =Eyeglasses= Will White accomplished another major league first. He was the first, and for many years the only, major league player to wear eyeglasses on the baseball field. In a later account of White's early years, The Sporting Life wrote: \\"White was about the only pitcher of consequence who wore glasses. He had great control of the ball, and he could land one over the plate whenever he wanted to notwithstanding he was handicapped by weak eyes.\\" The novelty of his wearing eyeglasses was a regular subject of coverage, and a 1911 newspaper story on \\"Eye-Glassed Players\\" noted that there were none in the game at that time and had been none since White. The famous slugger, Dan Brouthers, was quoted in the article as follows: \\"Will White, I suppose, was the last of the eye-glassed professionals. Near-sighted as Roosevelt ‚Äì and Teddy could play a good game of ball, I'll bet ‚Äì White was nevertheless a great pitcher. He had the curves, the speed and all sorts of scientific trickery.\\" =Cincinnati (NL)= In 1878, the White brothers joined the Cincinnati Reds, where they were battery-mates for the next three seasons. The 1878 season was White's first full season in professional baseball. He appeared in 52 games for the Reds, all complete games, and compiled a 30‚Äì21 record and a 1.79 ERA. By July 1878, White had earned the nickname \\"Whoop-La.\\" After pitching a four-hitter against Harry Wright's Boston club, the Cincinnati Enquirer ran a headline, \\"WHOOP-LA, WILLIAM!\\" When George Wright struck out swinging to end the eight inning, the crowd in Cincinnati \\"arose almost to a man and such cheers and waving of hats and handkerchiefs were never heard and seen on the grounds.\\" When White then walked to the plate and hit the first pitch for a double, there was more \\"howling\\" by screaming, frantic fans. In 1879, Deacon White took over as the manager of the Red Stockings for the first 16 games of the season.Lee Allen, The Cincinnati Reds, p. 19. The brothers also continued to work together as pitcher and catcher. After Will threw a four-hit shutout in June 1879, the Cincinnati Enquirer wrote that there could be \\"not a doubt in the world that with Jim [Deacon] to back him Will White as a pitcher is to-day without a peer.\\" During the 1879 season, Will White established several major league records. Out of the 80 games played that year by the Red Stockings, White started 75 of them, threw 75 complete games, totaled 680 innings pitched and 2,906 batters faced, and compiled a 43‚Äì31 record with a 1.99 ERA and 232 strikeouts. White's 1879 totals remain major league records in games started, complete games, innings pitched and batters faced. Pud Galvin tied White's games started record in 1883, but White's other records remain unmatched more than 130 years later. White's complete game and inning pitched records have been ranked with \\"baseball's most unbreakable records,\\" and the most \\"unapproachable\\" records. Diagram from O. P. Caylor's article on White's curve ball demonstration O. P. Caylor, one of the founders of the American Association, recalled that White was given the task in 1879 of demonstrating the curveball to Col. John A. Joyce, the \\"moving spirit\\" behind the Red Stockings. White was at the time \\"one of the most expert curvers in the profession.\\" Caylor described the demonstration that was conducted as follows: > \\"White stood upon the left of the fence at one end so that his hand could > not possibly pass beyond the straight line, and pitched the ball so that it > passed to the right of the middle post. This it did by three or four inches, > but curved so much that it passed the third post a half foot to the left. > The diagram on page 403 [reproduced at right] will illustrate the test.\\" In 1880, White pitched in fewer games, but was even more effective by some measures than he had been in his record-setting 1879 season. In his third full season, White started 62 games, all complete games, and compiled a 2.14 ERA in 517-1/3 inning pitched. White's performance in 1880 also earned him a 5.2 Wins Above Replacement (WAR) rating‚Äîthe tenth highest WAR rating in the National League that year. Unfortunately, White played for a team that compiled the lowest batting average in the National League; the 1880 Reds hit for a .224 average, 21 points below the league average and 55 points below the league- leading Chicago White Stockings. Lacking offensive support, White finished the season with an 18‚Äì42 win-loss record. =Detroit= Cincinnati was removed from the National League after the 1880 season, and the team folded, leaving White without a club. In April 1881, the newest National League club, the Detroit Wolverines, signed White after its principal pitcher, George Bradley, suffered with a pulmonary hemorrhage during a pre-season practice. When White was signed, the Detroit Free Press wrote of him: \\"He is too well known to base ball admirers to need an introduction.\\" On May 5, 1881, at Buffalo, New York, White appeared in the fourth game played by the Detroit Wolverines. He allowed eight runs and 13 hits, including two hits by his brother, Deacon White, who had joined the Buffalo club. Hardy Richardson also hit a bases-loaded triple in the ninth inning and was thrown out at home plate. The Wolverines lost the game, 8‚Äì1, but the Detroit Free Press wrote: \\"White, considering that he has had no practice to speak of this season, pitched very well, but he failed to bother the batsmen very badly.\\" White appeared in his second, and final, game for the Wolverines on May 12, 1881. Detroit lost by a 10‚Äì4 score to the Worcester Worcesters, and the press was less understanding after a second poor showing. The Detroit Free Press wrote: \\"White, who is an old-fashioned, straight-armed pitcher, not a modern underhanded thrower, is not the man for a pitcher's position. The Worcesters had no trouble in batting him, and the only wonder is that they made no more base hits and runs.\\" In his only two games for the 1881 Detroit Wolverines, White compiled an 0‚Äì2 record and a 5.00 ERA in 18 innings. The Detroit team settled on George Derby as its lead pitcher, with Stump Wiedman as the change pitcher, and White was released after two starts. White finished the 1881 season playing for a semipro team in Cincinnati. =Cincinnati (AA)= White (middle row, third from left) with the 1882 Cincinnati Red Stockings In November 1881, White signed to play with the Cincinnati Red Stockings for the inaugural season of the new American Association. During the 1882 season, White compiled a 40‚Äì12 record with a 1.54 ERA. He led the American Association in wins (40), complete games (52), and innings pitched (480). White also developed into one of the best-fielding pitchers in baseball. During the 1882 season, White had 223 fielding assists, a total that stood as the major league record for pitchers until Ed Walsh totaled 227 assists in 1907; White's total of 223 assists remains the second highest in major league history for a pitcher. White's 11.1 WAR rating in 1882 was the highest in the major leagues. White also proved to be a decent hitter during the 1882 season, batting .266 with 28 runs scored and 25 runs batted in. White pitched right-handed, but he was a switch hitter. Despite refusing to pitch on Sundays, White led the Red Stockings to their first pennant in 1882.(\\"Cincinnati's only pennant back in '82 was largely won through the efforts of a pitcher who never played ball on Sunday ‚Äì Whoopla Will White.\\") In 1883, White compiled a 43‚Äì22 record and led the league with 43 wins, a 2.09 ERA and six shutouts. White also ranked among the American Association's leaders with a 9.1 WAR rating (2nd), 1.000 Walks plus hits per inning pitched (WHIP) rating (3rd), 65 games played as pitcher (2nd), 577 innings pitched (2nd), 64 games started (2nd), and 64 complete games (2nd). In August 1883, White was baptized in the Second Advent denomination by being immersed in the Ohio River near Dayton, Kentucky. In 1884, White became a player-manager, managing the Reds for the first 71 games of the season and leading the club to a 44‚Äì27 record. In August 1884, White decided to step down as manager, believing he was \\"of too easy a disposition\\"; he persuaded his catcher, Pop Snyder, to take over as manager.Lee Allen, The Cincinnati Reds, p. 31. White remained the Reds' ace pitcher during the 1884 season, compiling a 34‚Äì18 and 3.32 ERA. He led the league with seven shutouts and again ranked among the league's leading pitchers with a 5.7 WAR rating (8th), 34 wins (5th), 456 innings pitched (7th), and 52 complete games (7th). Baseball historian David Nemec wrote that White's career suffered in 1884 when the American Association adopted a rule granting a batter a base if he was hit by a pitched ball. According to Nemec, the new rule deprived White of \\"one of his chief weapons ‚Äì intimidation.\\" White set a major league record in 1884 with 35 hit batsmen, a total that remains the ninth highest in major league history. He led the league again in 1885 with 27 batsmen hit by pitch. In an article titled \\"Will White's Misery\\", the Cincinnati Enquirer wrote after a 12‚Äì4 loss to the Metropolitans, \\"If ever a person had the conceit knocked completely out of him, that person was Will White yesterday afternoon.\\" White played his last full major league season for the Reds in 1885. He appeared in 34 games, threw 33 complete games and compiled an 18‚Äì15 record with a 3.53 ERA. In late August 1885, The Sporting Life correspondent from Cincinnati reported that White would not do any further pitching for the Reds \\"for some time to come\\", noting that the local fans held a \\"bitter feeling\\" toward White, which had caused the club president to employ other pitchers. According to baseball historian Joseph M. Overfield, White's \\"arm had nothing left\\" by the end of the 1885 season. In January 1886, The Sporting Life reported that White had \\"gone back to his first love ‚Äì the grocery business\\", opening a grocery in Fairmount, near Cincinnati. Another published story that same month reported that White's \\"delivery wagon can be seen almost any day on the street. White is not a loafer, and when base ball fails he makes money just like other people.\\" White returned briefly to baseball in June and July 1886, appearing in three games for Cincinnati. He compiled a 1‚Äì2 record as his ERA jumped to 4.15 in 26 innings pitched. He appeared in his last major league game on July 5, 1886, at age 31. Two days after White's last game, The Sporting Life reported: \\"Will White seems to have disappeared from the scene of action as quickly as he appeared. Surely two games didn't settle him.\\" =Buffalo= In December 1888, White's older brother, Deacon, and Jack Rowe, both of whom had been part of baseball's famed \\"Big Four\\" throughout the 1880s, purchased the Buffalo Bisons, a minor league baseball club, intending to be co-owners, managers, and players. In March 1889, Deacon White announced that he was also going into business in Buffalo with his brother, Will, and that Will had agreed to \\"twirl for the Bisons whenever needed.\\" In June 1889, White agreed to become a regular pitcher and also to serve as an assistant manager. With Will White returning to the game, The Sporting Life again focused on his glasses: \\"Will White still has his spectacles with him. He is the only professional player who wears them.\\" By early July, however, the newspaper was focused on his performance as it reported: \\"Will White is still quite a pitcher.\\" However, the brothers' plans were thwarted by William Nimick, the owner of the Pittsburgh Alleghenys. The Pittsburgh club held the rights to Rowe and Deacon White and refused to release them, saying, \\"If they don't want to play in Pittsburgh, they'll play nowhere.\\" In July 1889, Rowe and Deacon White agreed to play for Pittsburgh, and Will White was left in Buffalo to take over as \\"solo manager\\" of the Bisons. After two years away from baseball, White started 20 games for the 1889 Bisons, threw 17 complete games, and compiled a 7‚Äì13 record and a 2.33 ERA in 174 innings pitched. =Career statistics= During his 10 years in the major leagues, White compiled a 229‚Äì166 win-loss record.

The branch line fell into disuse when an alternative route was built between Windsor and Richmond stations. Purpose Windsor station, originally called \\"Chapel Street Station\\", was the terminus for northbound trains on the Brighton Beach line. It was run by the St Kilda and Brighton Railway Company, which built the loop line connecting the isolated Brighton line to the St Kilda line, so that the former could be connected to the city. Trains from the city travelled south to St Kilda terminus, and then \\"backed out\\" on to the loop line to Windsor. The loop was carried on wooden trestles across a swamp now known as the Albert Park Lake, and had a raised embankment with a bridge over St Kilda Road. A possible reason for the construction of the loop line connecting through to St Kilda was the difficulty experienced by contractors in constructing a rail crossing -over the Yarra River at Cremorne, known in the mid-19th century as \\"Forrest Hill\\". In the mid-19th century the railway bisected a swamp. Cooper (1924; p. 181) reports that when the rail embankment was first being constructed it subsided, burying ballast trucks in the swamp. The cost of recovering the trucks was deemed to be uneconomic, so a second embankment was constructed over them. Operation The first train on the loop line from St Kilda was on 3 December 1859, and it opened to the public ten days later. There were no trains after 7 pm on the branch line; patrons simply walked to their homes in Prahran from St Kilda station in Fitzroy Street. A short time after the loop line was constructed, a competing connection was built between Windsor and Richmond stations, with the first train arriving at Windsor directly from Melbourne on 24 November 1860. The loop line to St Kilda then fell into disuse, and track duplication, a condition of the original Crown lease, was never completed. Demise The alignment of the line at Windsor station today, current main line to city at right The St Kilda and Brighton Railway Company experienced financial difficulties, no doubt exacerbated by the direct link to Melbourne through Prahran and Windsor, and was bought by the Melbourne and Suburban Railway Company in 1862. The track, bridge and trestles between St Kilda Station and Punt Road were dismantled, probably less than five years after original construction. However, a siding from Windsor station to Hoddle Street remained. Due to the track alignments there were now two level crossings within on Union Street, because the siding continued to be used for shunting trains from the Brighton line, and to carry screenings from the Richmond quarries to a commercial depot on Punt Road (then known as Hoddle Street). Perversely, it was due to local annoyance at the level crossing on the siding near the station that trains won the legal right-of-way at road- rail intersections in Victoria. Indignant at the delays to horse-drawn traffic caused by trains, and in particular the perpetually closed and unmanned crossing of the siding, local councillors from Prahran marched to the level crossing in question one morning in 1869, with a group of workers who began to rip up the tracks on the siding. The matter was brought to court on 17 April 1869 and, although the railways won the right-of-way case, the siding was not reconstructed. No evidence remains of the embankments or the bridge over St Kilda Road, although the alignment of the loop can be traced by residual parkland and some oddly-shaped property boundaries. A small park to the west of Windsor station is called \\"Windsor Siding\\".

Operas at the time were in either the German or Italian style. The field Hungarian opera began with school dramas and interpolations of German operas, which began at the end of the 18th century. School dramas in places like the Pauline School in S√°toralja√∫jhely, the Calvinist School in Csurg√≥ and the Piarist School in Beszterce . Pozsony produced the first music drama experiments in the country, though the work of G√°sp√°r Pacha and J√≥zsef Chudy; it was the latter's 1793 Prince Pikk√≥ and Jutka Perzsi that is generally considered the first Hungarian opera. The text of that piece was translated from Prinz Schnudi und Prinzessin Evakathel by Philipp Hafner. This style was still strongly informed by the Viennese Zauberposse style of comedic play, and remained thus throughout the 19th century. Though these operas used foreign styles, the \\"idyllic, lyric and heroic\\" parts of the story were always based on verbunkos, which was becoming a symbol of the Hungarian nation during this time . It was not until the middle of the 19th century that Ferenc Erkel wrote the first Hungarian language opera, using French and Italian models, thus launching the field of Hungarian opera .

It is owned by the Greenspun family and is affiliated with Greenspun Media Group. The paper published afternoons on weekdays from 1990 to 2005 and is now included as a section inside the pages of the morning Las Vegas Review-Journal but continues operating exclusively on its own website. Its publisher and president is Brian Greenspun, former publisher Hank Greenspun's son, who was a college roommate of President Bill Clinton. He was welcomed by Clinton during his presidency, as a house guest during a Clinton fundraising trip to Southern Nevada. It has been described as \\"politically liberal.\\" History The Las Vegas Sun was first published on May 21, 1950, by Hank Greenspun, who served as its editor until his death. Hank acquired the Las Vegas Free Press and two weeks later renamed it to the Las Vegas Sun. He started the Las Vegas Sun after he received a US$1,000-loan from businessman Nate Mack. From its founding the paper was published in the mornings. Starting in 1989, after it signed a Joint Operating Agreement with the Las Vegas Review-Journal, the paper switched to publishing in the afternoon. On April 20, 2009, the Las Vegas Sun was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for coverage of the high death rate of construction workers on the Las Vegas Strip amid lax enforcement of regulations. The Pulitzer Prize committee noted that the Suns coverage led to changes in government policy and improved safety conditions. Alexandra Berzon was the primary author for the four-part series. Berzon promptly left the paper upon her win, as did health reporter and Pulitzer finalist Marshall Allen in 2011. Current status The afternoon edition of the paper was published until September 30, 2005, when, on October 2, 2005, the Las Vegas Sun began distribution with the Las Vegas Review-Journal. The change came about after the Sun entered into an amended joint operating agreement with the Las Vegas Review-Journal to deliver the Sun with the Review-Journal, but with the Sun's content inserted in the Review-Journal. The staff for each paper remained independent. The Sun is produced by its editors, reporters and photographers at The Greenspun Corporation's suburban Henderson offices, then printed by the Review-Journal and included inside the pages of the morning R-J. The section typically contains no advertisements. The two newspapers' editorial departments continue to have in-print disputes, often on the op-ed pages by Brian Greenspun and former Review-Journal publisher Sherman Frederick. Before Christmas in 2009, the Sun fired more than half its staff and changed its focus from daily news to feature stories and analysis. Then, in September 2011, the paper laid off a dozen additional employees, with Greenspun pointing to layoffs at the Sun a direct result of recent layoffs at the Review-Journal.

Unlike satellite owners RCA and Western Union, Hughes did not lease time on their transponders in the fashion of a common carrier, but instead sold transponders outright to content providers. This created a stable lineup of content attractive enough for cable providers to dedicate Earth station receivers to it full-time.

Retirement of Galaxy 1  In 1992, Galaxy 1 was replaced by Galaxy 5 as the predominant cable television signal carrier, when a majority of satellite television services were relocated onto that satellite. It was originally slated for retirement in 1992 and replacement by Galaxy 1R, but the replacement was lost during launch on 22 August 1992, due to a failure of the booster rocket's second stage Centaur engine; it was eventually replaced in 1994 by Galaxy 1RR.

The ship was commissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 8 September 1944, with Commander G. DeMetropolis in command. Service history Shakedown, which took Wallace L. Lind from the New York Navy Yard to Bermuda and back, extended through 2 November 1944. Departing Virginia en route to the Pacific on 14 November, she transited the Panama Canal on 27 November and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 13 December and underwent upkeep and training exercises. Wallace L. Lind and took leave of Hawaii on 23 December, escorting the aircraft carrier to Ulithi. Tracy left the formation and proceeded to Eniwetok, and she was replaced by . On 5 January 1945, the destroyer made rendezvous with the Fast Carrier Task Force (then Task Force 38) under Admiral William F. Halsey, Commander, 3rd Fleet. Air strikes against Luzon began on 6 January 1945 and were followed by strikes against Formosa, Saigon, the Pescadore Islands, and Hong Kong. Photo reconnaissance planes surveyed Okinawa Gunto in preparation for the upcoming invasion. On 23 January, Wallace L. Lind left the area north of Luzon and arrived at Ulithi three days later for upkeep. The destroyer reported for duty with Task Force 58, a fast carrier task force, on 11 February 1945. On 16 February, carrier planes conducted raids in the Tokyo area and, the following afternoon, retired toward Iwo Jima, with the carrier planes conducting air searches en route. On 19 February 1945, the carriers launched aircraft as cover for the initial landing of troops on Iwo Jima. These operations continued through 25 February when strikes again commenced against Tokyo. During the above actions, Wallace L. Lind was assigned to screen the carriers and to assist in mail deliveries and transfer of personnel. Wallace L. Linds destroyer group departed the Honsh≈´ area on 27 February and set course for Okinawa, arriving four days later. On 1 March, the vessel acted as a plane guard for strikes against Okinawa and Minami Daito. Upon recovery of the strike planes, the task group set course for Ulithi, Caroline Islands. After a period of routine upkeep, drydock, and availability, Wallace L. Lind set course for Ky≈´sh≈´, where the first air strikes were launched on 18 March. Numerous enemy aircraft appeared sporadically throughout this first day. The second day saw strikes and sweeps against Ky≈´sh≈´ targets, as well as a special sweep on Kii Suido. Two Japanese planes closed the formation, and the destroyer opened fire. Both planes were destroyed by gunfire. Wallace L. Lind departed the area on 19 March. The destroyer temporarily joined a unit which proceeded to execute shore bombardment against Minami Daito on 28 March. The following day, strikes were launched against airfields on Ky≈´sh≈´. She exploded two floating mines and fired on an enemy torpedo plane which crashed shortly afterward. While commencing a southerly retirement, Lind executed a strike against Amami Gunto en route. On 30 and 31 March 1945, strikes and sweeps over Okinawa Gunto provided cover for landing operations. The operations in that area continued, with intermittent strikes against Amami Gunto and refueling and rearming operations, throughout April. During the month of April, Wallace L. Lind destroyed two enemy planes and made three assists. The month of May was spent participating in strikes against Okinawa Gunto, Ky≈´sh≈´, and the Amami O'Shima-Kikai Jima area. Wallace L. Lind performed various duties ranging from screening the carriers to recovering downed pilots. During these operations, Japanese kamikaze planes dove on TF 58, hitting both Enterprise and . The destroyer participated in one shore bombardment, sank three mines, shot down three Japanese planes, and had two assists. This marked the end of a period of continuous steaming from 14 March 1945 when Wallace L. Lind started from Ulithi with TF 58 in support of the Okinawa occupation. On 1 June, Lind arrived at San Pedro Bay, Philippines, and went alongside the destroyer tender for availability through 12 June. The remainder of June was spent in various training exercises and getting the ship ready for sea. On 1 July 1945, Wallace L. Lind, in company with ships of Destroyer Squadron 62 (DesRon 62), got underway from San Pedro Bay in advance of the heavy ships of Task Group 38.3 (TG 38.3) to provide an anti-submarine screen for their sortie. Nine days later, the vessel arrived at the area off the east coast of Honsh≈´, Japan, and the task group launched strikes against the Tokyo plains area. Wallace L. Lind assumed duty as a picket station, then acted as a communication link between task groups. On 14 July 1945, she joined the carrier strikes on the east coast of Honsh≈´ and the northern Honsh≈´-Hokkaid≈ç target area. After refueling east of the Bonin Islands, Wallace L. Lind returned to the operating area of the east coast of Ky≈´sh≈´ on 24 July. She was then in position to act as a picket in the \\"Able Day\\" strikes against the Kure area. On 30 July, the task group launched strikes at air installations in the Tokyo-Nagoya area. The next day, the ships retired on a southerly course for replenishment. On 8 August, planes hit northern Honsh≈´ and Hokkaido as well as the Tokyo plains area. Wallace L. Lind received official word that the war with Japan had ceased on 15 August 1945. The task group moved to the southeast of Tokyo with all ships taking precautions against attacking enemy aircraft which persisted, in some cases, despite the war's end. =Post war= Wallace L. Lind at Venice in late 1949. On 1 September, the destroyer went alongside the carrier and took on board Vice Admiral John H. Towers and staff, and then transported them to Tokyo Bay for the surrender ceremonies. Vice Admiral Towers shifted his flag from Shangri-La to Wallace L. Lind, and upon completion of the ceremonies the following day, returned to Shangri-La. The destroyer took part in maintaining air patrols and searches over northern Japan in connection with the occupation; then, on 21 September, set course for Eniwetok.

Lind, along with and , engaged in the rescue of a pilot who had crash-landed in Wonsan harbor. While the three ships were attempting rescue operations, shore batteries opened fire on them, and Wallace L. Lind successfully returned fire. On 15 March 1951, a seven-ship naval bombardment of the Wonsan district resulted in reported enemy casualties of some 6,000. The following afternoon, shore batteries fired at the ships in the harbor, and counter-battery fire from the destroyers began in a matter of seconds. Gun positions were taken under fire, and several explosions were noted on the peninsula. On 17 March, Wallace L. Lind patrolled independently from Wonsan south along the coast. The ship took the city of Kosong under fire and exposed and silenced a camouflaged shore battery located south of Suwon Dan lighthouse. On 7 April 1951, as part of Special Task Force 74, Wallace L. Lind along with the destroyer , destroyer escort , landing ship dock , and heavy cruiser , helped to carry out raids on rail lines and tunnels utilizing 250 commandos of the 41st Independent Royal Marines. These highly successful destructive raids slowed down the enemy's resupply efforts, forcing the Communists to attempt to repair or rebuild the rail facilities by night while hiding the work crews and locomotives in tunnels by day. =Post Korea= Wallace L. Lind departed the Korean area on 9 May 1951 and arrived at Pearl Harbor 10 days later, having stopped at Yokosuka and Midway en route. She transited the Panama Canal and arrived at Norfolk on 9 June.

On 14 January 1959, the destroyer arrived at Livorno, Italy, and spent the remainder of the cruise operating between Italy and Spain. She made a brief stop at Cannes, France, before starting the trip homeward. Lind arrived at Norfolk on 8 April 1959, and participated in services and type training until July when she entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for an interim refitting and docking period. For the remainder of the year, she operated from her home port, making trips to Mayport, Florida, and Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, acting under the control of COMASWFORLANT for duty with the anti-submarine warfare hunter/killer forces. =1960= Wallace L. Lind operated with these forces through 29 June 1960 when she took on board 27 NROTC midshipmen for their annual training cruise. The destroyer demonstrated her antisubmarine warfare proficiency during this six-week outing which included stops at Halifax, Nova Scotia, and New York City. Throughout August and September, the destroyer prepared for NATO fall exercises in the North Atlantic. On 6 September, she sailed from Norfolk and spent four weeks operating at sea with NATO forces. It was during this cruise that she crossed the Arctic Circle, and all were initiated into the Royal Order of the Blue Noses. After returning to Norfolk on 20 October, Wallace L. Lind kept occupied with type training and miscellaneous services until December when she rejoined COMASWFORLANT for a brief assignment with the hunter/killer forces. Wallace L. Lind welcomed in the new year, 1961, while at sea with COMASWFORLANT. On 13 February, she sailed for the Caribbean and Operation \\"Springboard 61.\\" She returned to Norfolk, conducted local operations, and underwent upkeep commencing on 26 May. On 1 June 1961, Wallace L. Lands tender availability was interrupted when the destroyer was ordered to proceed, in company with other units of the 2nd Fleet, to the Dominican Republic. After three weeks of carrier task group operations, anti-submarine warfare, and shore bombardment exercises, the international crisis in that area lessened, and the destroyer returned to Norfolk on 20 June. Wallace L. Lind provided services as a DesLant Gunnery School ship at Newport, Rhode Island, from 23 June until 7 July. While participating in \\"Lantflex 2-61,\\" the destroyer spent the period between 17 and 27 July with midshipmen from the Naval Academy embarked on their summer cruise. From 11 August until 22 September 1961, the ship participated in Project Mercury and was assigned to an area just south of the Canary Islands. She returned to Norfolk on 22 September and remained in upkeep status through 1 October. On 16 October, Wallace L. Lind began a pre-FRAM availability; and, one month later, she underwent Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) II conversion. This overhaul amounted to a complete renewal of her after superstructure, a new and modern combat information center, and modernization or complete overhaul of almost all machinery, weapons systems, and living accommodations. Changes to weapons systems involved adding to the previously- installed Hedgehog mounts two new side torpedo racks amidships for current inventory torpedoes. Immediately aft of the torpedo deck on the 01 level of the new superstructure, a hangar area and flight deck, from which the new Drone Antisubmarine Helicopter (DASH) could operate, was installed. Also installed was a variable depth sonar rig adding coverage for submarine search at various depth levels. Wallace L. Lind was declared ready for sea on 25 August 1962. On 7 September, she arrived at Guantanamo for refresher training. After successfully completing the final operational readiness inspection on 17 October, the destroyer departed Guantanamo for Culebra Island, thence to Key West. However, while en route to Florida, the Cuban Missile Crisis intervened; and, on 21 October, the ship returned to Guantanamo. When the immediate crisis had ended, Lind returned to Norfolk on 28 November and commenced a needed in- port period of upkeep and preparation for the final outfitting with DASH. The destroyer followed a two-week visit to Key West as a Fleet Sonar School ship in March 1963 with a trip to NS Argentia, Newfoundland. This voyage north was interrupted by the news of the loss of the nuclear submarine . Wallace L. Lind, which was in the immediate vicinity at the time, joined in the search. The destroyer completed the year's competitive exercises in May and was occupied with rocket and missile firings in June.

It lies near the mouth of the River Averon, near the Cromarty Firth, with the town of Invergordon 3 miles (5 km) to the east, and the village of Evanton 4 miles (6 km) to the south-west. The parish has a population of 5,310, although the census locality, which includes part of the parish of Rosskeen, has a population of 5,186. According to the Highland Council, the population of Alness has increased by around 20% since the last census in 2011. The population as of 2016 was 6,101. For most of the 1990s and early 2000s, Alness regularly entered and won flower competitions such as Scotland in Bloom, Britain in Bloom and others, winning many awards. This helped regenerate many areas of the town, with housing estates winning separate awards. They have not entered in recent years due to the financial costs. The town is still adorned by flowers maintained by volunteers. In 2018, the town was crowned the Scottish Champion at the 2018 Great British High Street Awards.https://thegreatbritishhighstreet.co.uk/high-street-of-the-year- awards/the-winners The judges visited the shortlisted high streets across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, meeting local businesses, shoppers and community organisations, with Alness impressing with its reinvention over the years to become a place to find everything from florists and bridal wear to delis and bakeries.https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/news/highlands/1610617/alness- is-scottish-high-street-champion/ Geography The town is in two parishes divided by the River Averon in the west and Rosskeen in the east. Historically these were in different presbyteries. Today there are three churches; Free Church, Church of Scotland and Baptist. Education The town is served by a high school, Alness Academy, one of the main schools in Ross and Cromarty, with around 600 pupils on the school roll. There are three primary schools, Obsdale Primary, Bridgend Primary and Coulhill Primary, situated in the east, centre and west of the town respectively. The academy is also fed by schools from nearby towns Ardross and Evanton. Distilling There are two distilleries in Alness; Dalmore distillery and Teaninich distillery. Dalmore is owned and operated by Whyte and Mackay Ltd, which is owned by Philippines based Emperador Inc.\\"Philippines firm Emperador buys Whyte & Mackay for ¬£430m\\" The award-winning distillery creates a number of different whiskies that are produced in a combination of different stills, of various sizes which give the whisky a more complex character. Each expression of The Dalmore is matured in two different types of wooden casks: American white oak bourbon casks and exclusive aged sherry casks from Gonzalez Byass. Each sherry cask ‚Äì which is hand selected by master distiller Richard Paterson ‚Äì gives the whisky a deep copper colour and flavours of crushed almonds, cinnamon, ginger and citrus. The bourbon casks give the whisky notes of vanilla, spice, honey and tropical fruits. To create a more complex character, selected expressions are finessed in exceptional casks, showcasing woods from world-renowned bodegas and exclusive wineries. Teaninich was founded and built in 1817 by Hugh Munro on his estate of Teaninich Castle. Despite an initial difficulty of procuring barley whisky owing to a high demand from illegal distilleries, by 1830 Teaninich produced 30 times more spirit than it did at its founding. At that point the Munro sold the distillery to his younger brother Lieutenant-General John Munro. As an officer he spent most of his time in India, so he decided to rent the distillery out to Robert Pattison in 1850. The lease lasted to 1869 after which Munro leased it to John McGilchrist Ross. Ross relinquished the lease in 1895, and in 1898 Robert Innes Cameron took a stake in the distillery, and Munro and Cameron renovated and extended the distillery, investing ¬£10,000 in to the renovations. In 1904 Cameron, who also owned stakes in Benrinnes, Linkwood and Tamdhu, took over the distillery completely. After Cameron died in 1933 the distillery was sold to Scottish Malt Distillers. The distillery suspended production between 1939 and 1946 due to barley shortages during World War II. The distillery mainly produces malts for blending, and it is used in Johnnie Walker Red Label. There are no official bottlings of the malt. Since 1992 a 10-year-old malt has been available in the flora and fauna series. Amenities Alness has an 18-hole golf course, Alness Golf Club, which was established in 1904. The last five holes run alongside the River Averon, offering a contrast from the previous holes. The course was extended from 9 to 18 holes in 1997. A new clubhouse was officially opened in 2000 and offers all facilities. The Ardross Alness Bowling Club is situated next to the railway, and was formed in 1906.https://www.facebook.com/ArdrossAlnessBC1906 Transport Alness is served by Alness railway station on the Far North Line. The station consists of one platform on the northern side of the railway, with only a small shelter available. The original station platforms can still be seen on both sides of the single line through the station. The station is 28 1‚ÅÑ2 miles (45.9 km) north of Inverness on the Far North Line towards Wick. The Inverness and Ross- shire Railway (I&RR;), which was to be a line between and , was authorised in 1860, and opened in stages. By the time that the last section, that between and Invergordon, opened on 25 March 1863, the I&RR; had amalgamated with the Inverness and Aberdeen Junction Railway (I&AJR;), the authorisation being given on 30 June 1862. On this last stretch, one of the original stations was that at Alness. The I&AJR; in turn amalgamated with other railways to form the Highland Railway in 1865, which became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The line then passed on to the Scottish Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. The station at Alness was then closed by the British Transport Commission on 13 June 1960 and remained so for 13 years. The station reopened on 7 May 1973 and then when sectorisation was introduced by British Rail in the 1980s, was served by ScotRail until the privatisation of British Rail. History Monument to remember the Presbyterian communion held by John M'Gilligen In September 1715 the Skirmish of Alness took place between Jacobite clans such as the MacKenzies, MacDonalds under the Earl of Seaforth, and pro-government Munros, Rosses, MacKays under the Earl of Sutherland. The Jacobites drove their opponents over Struie to Bonar. The Fyrish Monument is a monument built in 1782 on Fyrish Hill (Cnoc Fyrish), in Fyrish near Alness, Easter Ross, Scotland, on the orders of Sir Hector Munro, 8th of Novar, a native lord of the area who had served in India. As the local population were being cleared off their land, employment was a problem and so it was built to give the locals some work. It was said that Sir Hector rolled stones from the top of the hill to the bottom, thereby extending the amount of time worked and paying the labourers for additional hours. It represents the Gate of Negapatam, a port in Madras, India, which General Munro took for the British in 1781. It is visible from almost anywhere in the parishes of Kiltearn and Alness. The site of the monument provides an extensive view over the Cromarty Firth and beyond, and Ben Wyvis can be seen clearly, especially impressive if snow-covered. A path to the top starts at a car park northeast of the hill at OS grid NH627715. During World War II, Alness was home to RAF Alness, a large training and operational base for Catalina amphibians and Sunderland seaplanes, which extended from Invergordon to Alness point - now an industrial estate. A memorial to the men who were killed on operational missions was placed at this industrial estate in 2001. A propeller from a Catalina was found and restored by RAF apprentices and now resides in the town of Alness. The tennis courts on the industrial estate are the only remaining parts of the estate which date from World War II.

A number of ghost stories and urban legends have become associated with the road, including the fictional deaths of a troop of Boy Scouts. The area has been the subject of several paranormal investigations, and has been a 'haunt' for youths hoping to experience a paranormal event. The land surrounding Boy Scout Lane is now privately owned and is off limits to the general public. Overview Boy Scout Lane is in the Town of Linwood, Portage County, Wisconsin. It is located west of the Wisconsin River Golf Club, on West River Drive (West), and is situated between Cemetery Road and Little Chicago Road. It is unpaved and about long. The road was named Boy Scout Lane because the land that it is located near was once owned by the Boy Scouts of America, who planned to use the land to build a Scout camp. Although the camp was never constructed and the land remains woodland, the name was still used. Urban legend According to a local urban legend, the road is named for a troop of Boy Scouts who were killed while on a camping trip in the 1950s or 1960s. In some variations the murderer is the troop's Scoutmaster. In others it is their bus driver. In other versions of the legend, a small group of Scouts leave their camp during the night and accidentally drop their lantern, resulting in a forest fire that kills the entire troop. Other variations of the story exist including one in which the Scouts are killed after their bus crashes or accidentally catches fire. There is also a version in which the Scouts vanish without explanation and are never found. In some versions of the legend, two Boy Scouts escaped the fate of the rest of the troop and tried to find help, only to become lost in the woods where they die of starvation and/or exposure. In most variations of the legend it is said that the dead Scouts haunt the forest where they died and can be heard hiking through the undergrowth, or their lights can be seen at night as they seek help or their fellow Scouts. Stories circulated in \\"haunted travel guides\\" include visitors reporting a strong sense of foreboding or \\"being watched\\", the sound of footsteps or breaking branches coming from multiple directions, red or white lights sometimes described as resembling swinging lanterns or flashlight beams, ghostly buses or figures, and \\"childlike hand prints\\" on cars stopped in or driven through the area.

The University Entrance Qualification Examination has been accepted for many universities in Japan, such as Japan's most prestigious University of Tokyo because MEXT has been encouraging post-secondary educations to recognise the certificate. However, it is looked down upon by some employers and universities in the United States and other countries as a lower form of degree than an actual high school diploma. The certificate is meant to certify that the bearer has an academic ability equivalent to a graduate of an upper secondary school. The passing rates of this exams are about 30% to 40% every year. For 2014, there are about 37.1% of students who had passed this examination.  Awardees  Individuals who are or will become 16 years old during the academic year (April to the following March) can take this exam. However, those who are awarded the certificate can not enter a university until they become 18 years old since the certificate is with the proviso that no qualifications until he or she becomes 18 years old. There is an educational exception for one who is 17 years old or older, and is recognised by the university, that he or she has an outstanding skill or talent in a certain field of study that the university specified, can enter the university. This exception can be applied for universities only and not for other educational institutions. Unlike the GED in the United States or Canada, in Japan, the majority taking the exam are truant students, although there are many who did not go to high school for various other reasons. Truancy in students has become one of the most serious problems in Japan, often with its roots in bullying and harassment. There is one truant for every 50 students in elementary school and that number makes up approximately 130,000 children who are refusing to go to school, and miss an average of 18 months to two years of class, according to the recent study by MEXT.

In contrast to rear projection, which projects footage onto a screen from behind the performers, front projection projects the pre-filmed material over the performers and onto a highly reflective background surface. Description In contrast to rear projection, in front projection the background image is projected onto both the performer and a highly reflective background screen, with the result that the projected image is bounced off the screen and into the lens of a camera. This is achieved by having a screen made of a retroreflective material such as Scotchlite, a product of the 3M company that is also used to make screens for movie theaters. Such material is made from millions of glass beads affixed to the surface of the cloth. These glass beads reflect light back only in the direction from which it came, far more efficiently than any common surface. The actor (or subject) performs in front of the reflective screen with a movie camera pointing straight at them. Just in front of the camera is a one-way mirror angled at 45 degrees. At 90 degrees to the camera is a projector which projects an image of the background onto the mirror which reflects the image onto the performer and the highly reflective screen; the image is too faint to appear on the actor but shows up clearly on the screen. In this way, the actor becomes their own matte. The combined image is transmitted through the mirror and recorded by the camera. The technique is shown and explained in the \\"making-of-documentary\\" of the 1972 sci-fi film Silent Running. Front projection was invented by Will Jenkins. For this he holds patent #2727427, issued on December 20, 1955 for an \\"Apparatus for Production of Light Effects in Composite Photography\\" and patent 2727429, issued the same day for an \\"Apparatus for Production of Composite Photographic Effects.\\" It was first experimented with in 1949, shortly after the invention of Scotchlite, and had appeared in feature films by 1963, when the Japanese film Matango used it extensively for its yacht scenes. Another early appearance was in 1966, during the filming of 2001: A Space Odyssey. The actors in ape suits were filmed on a stage at Elstree Studios and combined with footage of Africa (the effect is revealed in the leopard's glowing eyes reflecting back the light). Dennis Muren used a very similar solution for his 1967 debut film Equinox, although Muren's technique didn't employ Scotchlite. Two British films released in 1969, On Her Majesty's Secret Service and The Assassination Bureau, used the technique, as did the 1968 film Where Eagles Dare. =Zoptic= Front projection was chosen as the main method for shooting Christopher Reeve's flying scenes in Superman. However, they still faced the problem of having Reeve actually fly in front of the camera. Effects wizard Zoran Perisic patented a new refinement to front projection that involved placing a zoom lens on both the movie camera and the projector. These zoom lenses are synchronized to zoom in and out simultaneously in the same direction. As the projection lens zooms in, it projects a smaller image on the screen; the camera lens zooms in at the same time, and to the same degree, so that the projected image (the background plate) appears unchanged, as seen through the camera. However the subject placed in front of the front projection screen appears to have moved closer to the camera; thus Superman flies towards the camera. The technique is analogous to the more commonly discussed dolly zoom effect. Perisic called this technique \\"Zoptic\\". The process was also used in two of the Superman sequels (but not used in the fourth movie due to budget constraints), Return to Oz, Radio Flyer, High Road to China, Deal of the Century, Megaforce, Thief of Baghdad, Greatest American Hero (TV), as well as Perisic's films as director, Sky Bandits (also known as Gunbus) and The Phoenix and the Magic Carpet. =Introvision= Introvision is a front projection composite photography system using a pair of perpendicular reflex screens to combine two projected scenes with a scene staged live before the camera in a single shot. It allows foreground, midground and background elements to be combined in-camera: such as sandwiching stage action (such as actors) between two projected elements, foreground and background. In its simplest form, images from a projector are directed at a beam splitter oriented at forty-five degrees. Two retro reflective screens are used, one to return the reflected image and one to return the pass through image. Set between the beam splitter and the retro reflective screens are mattes with cut outs that allow the projected image to strike each retro reflective screens in select areas. This combination, as seen by the camera, gives the appearance of images behind the actors (reflected image) and in front of the actors (pass through image). The camera sees the pass through image on the reverse side of the beam splitter and the reflected image through the beam splitter and combines the two eliminating the need for compositing in post production. To compensate for the large difference in the distance from the camera to the two screens an additional lens is used in the pass through image path. The more complicated setup involves the use of two cameras, two projectors and multiple beam-splitters, light traps, filters and aperture control systems. This setup provides the opportunity to use different content for foreground and background. Introvision was first used in 1980‚Äì81 during the filming of the science-fiction movie Outland to combine star Sean Connery and other performers with models of the Io mining colony. It was also used in the telefilm Inside the Third Reich to place actors portraying Adolf Hitler and Albert Speer in the long-destroyed Reichstag, as well as Under Siege, Army of Darkness and The Fugitive, where it seemed to place Harrison Ford on top of a bus that was then rammed by a train. Adventures in Babysitting employed IntroVision to place children in multiple situations of peril such as hanging from the rafters and scaling the \\"Smurfit-Stone Building\\" in Chicago, and Stand By Me used IntroVision during the train sequence. Most movie companies brought small units to the Introvision sound stages near Poinsettia and Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood, California. Scenes were often shot near the end of the production schedule to allow for the shooting of \\"live\\" plates to have been done while on location. Front projection versus other techniques Compared to back projection, the front projection process used less studio space, and generally produced sharper and more saturated images, as the background plate was not being viewed through a projection screen. The process also had several advantages over bluescreen matte photography, which could suffer from clipping, mismatched mattes, film shrinkage, black or blue haloing, garbage matte artifacts, and image degradation/excessive grain. It could be less time-consuming‚Äîand therefore less expensive‚Äîthan the process of optically separating and combining the background and foreground images using an optical printer. It also allowed the director and/or director of photography to view the combined sequence live, allowing for such effects to be filmed more like a regular sequence, and the performers could be specifically directed to time their actions to action or movement on the projected images. However, advancements in digital compositing and the increasing use of digital cameras have made digital the most common method of choice. The last major blockbuster to extensively use front projection was the Sylvester Stallone action thriller Cliffhanger from 1993. More recently, the film Oblivion‚Äîstarring Tom Cruise‚Äîmade extensive use of front projection (though not retro-reflective) to display various sky backgrounds in the home set. Spectre also used this technique for its snow mountain hospital and glass building interiors. The advantages for the in-camera effect were a reduced need for digital effects and green screen, interactive lighting in a reflective set, and to provide a real background for the actors.

As of 2019, there are 566 Bush Fire Brigades (BFBs) with 19,521 volunteers.https://www.dfes.wa.gov.au/publications/Annual%20Reports/DFES_Annual_Report-2018-19.pdf The Volunteer Fire and Emergency Services (VFES) is also a volunteer service. It was established to combine the resources of any combination of a BFS Brigade, a VFRS Brigade, VMRS Group or an SES Unit to replace the Volunteer Fire Services (VFS) and Volunteer Emergency Service (VES) in 2016https://www.dfes.wa.gov.au/aboutus/operationalinformation/Pages/volunteerfireandemergencyservices.aspx It has just over 1,000 volunteers as of 2019. The State Emergency Service (SES) is a volunteer service with the role of attending a vast array of natural disasters and search and rescue incidents. They attend land searches for missing people, storm damage, urban search and rescue (USAR), cliff rescue, transport personnel and equipment to fires as well as many other roles. The SES has a K9 unit with volunteer's dogs being trained in searching for missing people and a mounted unit for land searches. As of 2019 they had 1,839 volunteers. The Volunteer Marine Rescue Service (VMRS) is another volunteer service tasked with assisting the Western Australian Police with searches for missing people or vessels, assisting disabled vessels and rescues in water around the state. As of 2019 there are 39 VMRS Groups with 1,752 volunteers.https://www.dfes.wa.gov.au/aboutus/operationalinformation/Pages/volunteermarinerescueservices.aspx In April 2018 a new Rural Fire Division was announced after the findings of the 2016 Waroona Bushfire Special Inquiry.

She was the founder of Alive & Well AIDS Alternatives, an organization which disputes the link between HIV and AIDS and urges HIV-positive pregnant women to avoid anti-HIV medication. Maggiore authored and self-published the book What If Everything You Thought You Knew about AIDS Was Wrong? Maggiore's promotion of AIDS refutation had long been controversial, particularly since her 3-year-old daughter, Eliza Jane Scovill, died of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, which is an AIDS- defining illness. Consistent with her belief that HIV was harmless, Maggiore had not taken medication to reduce the risk of transmission of HIV to her daughter during pregnancy, and she did not have Eliza Jane tested for HIV during her daughter's lifetime. Maggiore herself died on December 27, 2008, after suffering from AIDS-related conditions. Early life and career Born in Chicago, Illinois, Maggiore grew up in Southern California. After graduating with honors from Reseda High School, she worked in advertising and marketing in Los Angeles, California until 1984. She traveled through Europe and North Africa in 1984 before settling in Florence, Italy, where she lived from 1985 to 1987. By the late 1980s, she was earning a high salary at the Alessi International clothing company. HIV diagnosis and activism In 1992, as part of a routine medical exam, Maggiore tested positive for HIV, as did a former boyfriend. Subsequently, Maggiore became involved in volunteer work for a number of AIDS charities, including AIDS Project Los Angeles, L.A. Shanti, and Women at Risk. However, following an interaction with prominent AIDS denialist Peter Duesberg in 1994, Maggiore began to question whether HIV causes AIDS. Maggiore came to believe that her positive test may have been due to influenza vaccination, pregnancy, or a common viral infection. In 1995, Maggiore left the clothing business to work as a freelance consultant for US government export programs. At the same time, she founded Alive & Well AIDS Alternatives, an organization denying the connection between HIV and AIDS and urging pregnant HIV-positive women to avoid HIV medications for themselves and their children. Maggiore herself drew criticism for breast-feeding her children, as breast feeding has been shown to increase the risk of mother-to- child transmission of HIV.For examples, see:  In a 2002 article entitled \\"My Bout of So-Called AIDS\\", Maggiore wrote that she had an abnormal Pap smear (a \\"Grade 3 Pap smear with cervical dysplasia\\"), which she wrote would qualify her for an AIDS diagnosis.In fact, although invasive cervical cancer is an AIDS-defining illness, an abnormal Pap smear has never been an AIDS-defining condition. Maggiore's doctors recommended further evaluation with colposcopy; Maggiore writes that she instead followed a naturopathic program and had additional Pap tests performed under an assumed name by another doctor, ultimately obtaining what she described as a normal result. In a 2005 article in the Los Angeles Times, Maggiore claimed to be in excellent health without taking anti-retroviral treatment. Maggiore's husband and partner, filmmaker Robin Scovill, has repeatedly tested negative despite what Maggiore describes as \\"a decade of normal, latex-free relations\\". Their son Charlie, born in 1997, has also tested negative for HIV. Maggiore's inclusion as an exhibitor at the 13th International AIDS Conference in Durban, South Africa has been criticized by AIDS activists.Criticism of Maggiore's inclusion in the 13th International AIDS Conference Her influence on Thabo Mbeki's decision to block medical treatment of HIV-positive pregnant women was criticized following her death, with medical researchers noting that an estimated \\"330,000 lives were lost to new AIDS infections during the time Mbeki blocked government funding of AZT treatment to mothers.\\" Eliza Jane Christine Maggiore chose not to take antiretroviral drugs or other measures which reduce the risk of mother- to-child transmission of HIV during her pregnancies.Given the known and unknown risks of antiretroviral use in pregnancy, National Institutes of Health guidelines state that the final decision regarding their use \\"should be made by the woman after discussion with her health care provider about the known and unknown benefits and risks of therapy\\" in a \\"noncoercive\\" environment; see Maggiore also breastfed her children, despite evidence that breastfeeding can also transmit HIV from mother to child. Her youngest daughter, Eliza Jane, was never tested for HIV, nor did she or her older brother Charlie receive any of the recommended childhood vaccines. Maggiore later reported Charlie to have tested HIV-negative three times, and asserted that both were in good health. In April 2005, Eliza Jane became ill with a runny nose. She was seen by two physicians, one of whom reportedly knew of Maggiore's HIV status. Eliza Jane was not tested for HIV and was diagnosed with pneumonia. When Eliza Jane failed to improve, Maggiore took her to see Philip Incao, a holistic practitioner and board member of Maggiore's organization Alive & Well AIDS Alternatives, who described Eliza Jane as only mildly ill and prescribed her amoxicillin for a presumed ear infection. On May 16, 2005, Eliza Jane collapsed and stopped breathing. She was rushed to Valley Presbyterian Hospital in Van Nuys, California, where, after failed attempts to revive her, she was pronounced dead. An autopsy revealed that Eliza Jane was markedly underweight and underheight (consistent with a chronic illness), exhibited pronounced atrophy of her thymus and other lymphatic organs, and died of pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii, a common opportunistic pathogen in people with AIDS and the leading cause of pediatric AIDS deaths.HIV Infection in Infants and Children; thebody.com; July 2004 Accessed 20 July 2007. The postmortem examination of Eliza Jane's brain showed changes consistent with HIV encephalitis; protein components of HIV itself were identified in Eliza Jane's brain tissue via immunohistochemistry. The coroner concluded that Eliza Jane had died of Pneumocystis pneumonia in the setting of advanced AIDS. Maggiore rejected the coroner's conclusion, ascribing it to political bias and attacking the personal credibility of the senior coroner.Justice For E.J., website maintained by David Crowe of the Alberta Reappraising AIDS Society, accessed September 5, 2006. Maggiore had the autopsy reviewed by Mohammed Al-Bayati, a veterinary pathologist who holds a Ph.D. in animal disease pathology, but is neither a medical doctor nor board- certified in human pathology. Al-Bayati argued that Eliza Jane had died from an allergic reaction to amoxicillin, a conclusion Maggiore embraced. Al- Bayati's report has been dismissed as medically unsound by independent pathology experts, who agreed with the coroner's conclusion that Eliza Jane had died of complications of untreated AIDS.Christine Maggiore: AIDS naysayer, accessed September 5, 2006. =Reaction to Eliza Jane's death= Controversy ensued in the wake of Eliza Jane's death; as Eliza Jane had acquired HIV from Maggiore perinatally or via breastfeeding, her HIV infection might have been prevented had Maggiore taken antiretroviral drugs or avoided breastfeeding, and her death may have been preventable with proper medical care. John Moore, a prominent HIV/AIDS researcher speaking at the 16th International AIDS Conference, described Eliza Jane's death as a concrete example of the human harm that can result from pseudoscientific beliefs such as AIDS denialism: During this controversy, Maggiore had held fast to her views on HIV/AIDS and to Al-Bayati's conclusion. She received support from others in the AIDS- denialist community; journalist Celia Farber wrote an article in June 2006 in the independent paper Los Angeles CityBeat arguing Maggiore's case and alleging incompetence, conspiracy, and coverups on the part of the coroner, the mainstream AIDS community, the mainstream media, and the medical community. In particular, Farber claimed that the coroner's office had not disclosed the records of Eliza Jane's HIV serology test, and quoted another denialist who claimed Eliza Jane's total lymphocyte count was elevated at the time of her death.Celia Farber, A Daughter's Death, A Mother's Survival, Los Angeles City Beat. Eliza Jane's death was investigated by the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles Department of Child Protective Services as a possible case of medical neglect or child endangerment. In September 2006, the L.A. County District Attorney's office announced that it would not file charges against Christine Maggiore, noting that Maggiore did take her sick child to several physicians. In September 2006, the Medical Board of California filed charges of gross negligence against Eliza Jane's pediatrician, Paul M. Fleiss. The board argued that Fleiss had failed to test Eliza Jane for HIV (or to document her parents' refusal of testing), failed to counsel Maggiore to avoid breastfeeding given the risk of transmitting HIV, and committed similar violations of standard medical practice in Fleiss' care of a second HIV-positive child. Ultimately, Fleiss conceded a failure to keep adequate medical records and was sanctioned with 35 months of probation, but was not found grossly negligent by the Board. Maggiore and her husband, Robin Scovill, sued Los Angeles County in 2007 for allegedly violating their daughter's civil rights and privacy by releasing her autopsy report, which indicated that she was HIV-positive. A settlement was reached in 2009. Death On December 27, 2008, Maggiore died at the age of 52. She was under a doctor's care and was being treated for what was originally reported as pneumonia. The Los Angeles County coroner's office stated that Maggiore had been treated for pneumonia in the six months prior to her death as well. A doctor familiar with the family noted that anti-HIV drugs could have prevented her death, but Maggiore's fellow AIDS denialists argued that her pneumonia was not AIDS-related and suggested instead that she died as a result of a toxic alternative medicine \\"holistic cleanse\\", stress, or the cold and flu. Maggiore's death certificate states that the cause of death was disseminated herpes virus infection and bilateral pneumonia, with oral candidiasis as a contributing cause, all of which can be related to HIV infection. The death certificate also states there was no autopsy performed.

It is based in East Tamaki, New Zealand. Originally an importer of domestic refrigerators, Fisher & Paykel now holds over 420 patents and bases its identity on innovative design, particularly in the areas of usability and environmental awareness. The company's trademarked appliances include Active Smart refrigerators, AeroTech ovens, DishDrawer dishwashers, Smart Drive washing machines and Smartload top loading dryers. The company also manufactures gas and electric cooktops. In 2004, Fisher & Paykel Appliances purchased the United States- based cookware manufacturer Dynamic Cooking Systems, and Italian cookware company Elba in 2006. Fisher & Paykel had grown into a global company operating in 50 countries and manufacturing in Thailand, China, Italy and Mexico. The company had a manufacturing base in Australia for almost 20 years and nearly 70 years in New Zealand, but stated it can no longer compete with low cost labour countries and had to close them. In 2012, Haier, a major Chinese appliance manufacturer, purchased over 90% of Fisher & Paykel Appliance shares.  History  Fisher & Paykel Appliances Ltd was listed publicly in 2001, following the separation of Fisher & Paykel Industries Ltd into Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Ltd and Fisher & Paykel Appliances Ltd that same year. =Fisher & Paykel Industries= Fisher & Paykel Industries Ltd was founded in 1934 by Sir Woolf Fisher and Maurice Paykel. The company publicly listed in 1979 with authorised capital of NZ$ 40 million. Initially the company was an importer of Crosley appliances, Maytag and Pilot products; in 1938 the company began manufacturing Kelvinator washing machines under license. This followed the introduction of tariffs by the First Labour Government of New Zealand. In 1956, manufacturing was moved to a purpose-built factory in Mount Wellington, Auckland. This facility included flexible machinery manufacturing techniques developed in tandem with the raw material suppliers, enabling Fisher & Paykel Industries to greatly increase production. In 1955, Fisher and Paykel acquired Dunedin electric oven manufacturer H. E. Shacklock Ltd, which dominated the New Zealand domestic appliance market through the era of Government protectionism. Subsequently, the Shacklock brand was gradually withdrawn from the Fisher and Paykel product range. The company began exporting within Australasia and East Asia around 1968. At that time the company also manufactured cabinets, sparkplugs and televisions. During the 1980s, the company became more focused on research and development, resulting in the development of the ECS direct drive mechanism washing machine and highly automated production lines. In 1989, the company opened its first overseas manufacturing facility in Cleveland, Australia. The company entered the European market in 1992, and by 1994 was exporting to over 80 countries. =Fisher & Paykel Appliances= On 12 November 2001, Fisher & Paykel Industries split into Fisher & Paykel Appliances Holdings Ltd and Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Corporation Ltd. In October 2004, Fisher & Paykel Appliances acquired Dynamic Cooking Systems Inc, a United States manufacturer and distributor of cooking appliances. Dynamic Cooking Systems was acquired for US$33 million (NZ$49.3 million) in a debt-free state, allowing the company to leverage market presence while maintaining its quality of engineering. In June 2006, the Italian cookware business Elba was acquired from DeLonghi for ‚Ç¨78 million (NZ$158 million). Elba has been since renamed as Fisher & Paykel Appliances Italy S.p.A. and exports to over 54 countries, focusing on the UK market. Fisher & Paykel makes a relatively broad range of mid to high end dishwashers. Its notable drawcard to the Fisher & Paykel brand is the DishDrawer dishwasher. Most dishwasher brands don't offer drawer-style dishwashers, so Fisher & Paykel is the leader for this niche design. In 2018, Australian customers gave Fisher & Paykel 4 out of 5 stars for overall customer satisfaction for dishwashers. Current products DishDrawer dishwasher Fisher & Paykel Appliances currently manufactures cooking, laundry and whiteware appliances. The company's flagship product is the DishDrawer double drawer dishwasher which is claimed to wash dishes more efficiently than standard dishwashers or hand washing. The current Fisher & Paykel-branded product range includes built-in ovens, electric cooktops, dishwashers, dryers, freezers, ranges, rangehoods, refrigerators and washing machines. A large number of Fisher & Paykel products utilise microprocessor and brushless DC electric motor technology from production line equipment to improve efficiency. The company's trademarked brushless motor-based performance features include Smart Drive washing machines, SmartLoad Dryers and DishDrawer dishwashers. Microprocessor-based control systems form the basis of Active Smart refrigerators and AeroTech ovens.

He is considered to be a close ally to Russian billionaire businessman Vladimir Bogdanov, Director General of Surgutneftegaz. As the Mayor of Moscow, Sobyanin has gradually relaxed the massive construction projects of his predecessor, for which he has won acclaim for the \\"most sane piece of city planning in years.\\" As Mayor, Sobyanin created large mass media holding group of numbers TV and radio channels and newspapers, owned and controlled by Moscow Government. And he has also won praise for his efforts in combatting corruption. At the same time, Sobyanin was criticized for the banning of gay parades in the city, for which he was strongly condemned by LGBT groups. Early life and career Sergey Sobyanin was born in an ethnic Mansi village of Nyaksimvol in the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug (then in the Russian SFSR of the Soviet Union). After finishing a local school in Beryozovsky District in 1975, Sobyanin matriculated to the Kostroma Technology Institute in Kostroma. On graduation he received an assignment to the large tube-rolling factory in Chelyabinsk. Started working as a machinist there. From 1982 to 1984 he worked with Komsomol in Chelyabinsk. In 1984, he returned to Kogalym. There, he worked as a vice-chairman of the Kogalym selsovet (lowest level of administrative subdivision in rural areas), in a municipal economy department and local tax administration. In 1989, he got a second degree in jurisprudence (All-Union Correspondence Institute of Law). His PhD thesis was titled \\"Legal position of the autonomous okrugs as federal subjects of Russia\\". On 23 May 2007, at the Institute of Legislation and Comparative Jurisprudence at Government of Russia, defence of Sobyanin's higher doctoral thesis \\"RF subject in economical and social development of the state\\" were to take place on the basis of his monograph published shortly before the event. But the defence was cancelled due to an unknown reason. Examination of Dissernet of Sobyanin's doctoral thesis and the monograph of 2007 exposed high level of plagiarism. Political career In 1991, he was elected mayor of Kogalym. Since 1993, he has been the First Deputy of the Head of the Administration of the Khanty‚ÄìMansi Autonomous Okrug. In 1994, he was elected chairman of the Khanty‚ÄìMansi Duma. In January 1996, he became a member of the Federation Council of Russia. Since July 1998, he has been chairman of the Constitutional Law, Judicial, and Legal Problems Committee. On 27 October 1996, he was re-elected as a delegate and a chairman of the Khanty‚ÄìMansi Duma. On 12 July 2000 he was appointed the First Deputy of Plenipotentiary of President of Russia in the Urals Federal District. On 14 January 2001 he was elected governor of Tyumen Oblast. During the campaign, oil tycoon Vladimir Bogdanov was its confidant. He has been a member of the Supreme Council of the \\"United Russia\\" political party since 2004. In 2005, Sergey Sobyanin sent a request to the President of Russia about a vote of confidence. That was done in case of the change of the governor assignment procedure. Vladimir Putin nominated him for election by the Duma of the Tyumen Oblast and he was finally reelected on 17 February 2005. In November 2005, he was appointed a head of the Administration of the President of Russia. Since 21 October 2010, he has been the Mayor of Moscow. Awarded a Medal of Honour, church IInd stage order of St. Kniaz Danil Moscowskiy, Medal of Honour in Education, French Republic Medal of Honour in Agriculture. Laureate of the \\"2003 Russia's Man of the Year: Politician\\" prize. Mayor of Moscow Solemn opening of the celebration of the 870th anniversary of Moscow, 9 September 2017 = City planning = The preservation organization Archnadzor criticized Sobyanin for his razing of historical landmarks to make way for contemporary buildings. In March 2012, Sobyanin garnered controversy for doing little to clean up the city side walks. =Moscow housing relocation programme= Moscow housing relocation programme involves the demolition of dilapidated five-storey blocks of flats and the relocation of their residents to modern housing. The project's aim is to prevent five-storey blocks of flats from turning into hazardous housing unfit for living. The programme stipulates providing the residents of buildings put on the demolition list with equivalent living space with amenities in new buildings in their district. The list of buildings in the programme includes more than 5000 blocks of flats with a total area of about 16,000,000 square metres and about one million residents. Criticism Sobyanin has in recent years become a major target of controversy in the press. According to an independent poll, most Muscovites believe that since coming to power, Sobyanin's leadership has not differed from that of Yury Luzhkov. =Moscow gay parades= In February 2011, Sobyanin drew the ire of LGBT groups when he deemed Gay Parades to be \\"illegal\\" in Moscow. In response to this act, several gays organised a parade without approval in May 2011, during which 30 gay supporters were arrested, including several foreigners. Acclaimed British actor Sir Ian McKellen heavily criticised Sobyanin for the ban on parades, even going as far as using the word \\"coward\\" to describe Sobyanin. Personal life Sergey Sobyanin was married to Irina Sobyanina, a cousin of the Minister for Energy in Mikhail Kasyanov's Cabinet, . They divorced on 21 February 2014. The couple have two daughters: Anna (b. 1986) and Olga (b. 1997). He is of Russian and Mansi ancestry.Keith McCloskey (2013). \\"Mountain of the Dead: The Dyatlov Pass Incident\\".

Every node x has an s-value which is the distance to the nearest leaf in subtree rooted at x. In contrast to a binary heap, a leftist tree attempts to be very unbalanced. In addition to the heap property, leftist trees are maintained so the right descendant of each node has the lower s-value. The height-biased leftist tree was invented by Clark Allan Crane. The name comes from the fact that the left subtree is usually taller than the right subtree. A leftist tree is a mergeable heap. When inserting a new node into a tree, a new one-node tree is created and merged into the existing tree. To delete an item, it is replaced by the merge of its left and right sub-trees. Both these operations take O(log n) time. For insertions, this is slower than Fibonacci heaps, which support insertion in O(1) (constant) amortized time, and O(log n) worst-case. Leftist trees are advantageous because of their ability to merge quickly, compared to binary heaps which take Œò(n). In almost all cases, the merging of skew heaps has better performance. However merging leftist heaps has worst-case O(log n) complexity while merging skew heaps has only amortized O(log n) complexity. Bias The usual leftist tree is a height-biased leftist tree. However, other biases can exist, such as in the weight-biased leftist tree.  S-value  S-values of a leftist tree The s-value (or rank) of a node is the distance from that node to the nearest leaf in the subtree rooted at that node. Put another way, the s-value of a \`null\` child is implicitly zero. Other nodes have an s-value equal to one more the minimum of their children's s-values. Thus, in the example at right, all nodes with at least one missing child have an s-value of 1, while node 4 has an s-value of 2, since its right child (8) has an s-value of 1. (In some descriptions, the s-value of null children is assumed to be ‚àí1.) Knowing the shortest path to the nearest missing leaf in the subtree rooted at x is exactly of s(x), every node at depth s(x)‚àí1 or less has exactly 2 children since s(x) would have been less if not. Meaning that the size of the tree rooted at x is at least 2^{s(x)}-1. Thus, s(x) is at most \\\\log{(m+1)}, m being the number of nodes of the subtree rooted at x.  Operations on a height biased leftist tree Most operations on a Height Biased Leftist Tree are done using the merge operation. = Merging two Min HBLTs = The merge operation takes two Min HBLTs as input and returns a Min HBLT containing all the nodes in the original Min HBLTs put together. If either of A or B is empty, the merge returns the other one. In case of Min HBLTs, assume we have two trees rooted at A and B where A.key \\\\leq B.key. Otherwise we can swap A and B so that the condition above holds. The merge is done recursively by merging B with A's right subtree. This might change the S-value of A's right subtree. To maintain the leftist tree property, after each merge is done, we check if the S-value of right subtree became bigger than the S-value of left subtree during the recursive merge calls. If so, we swap the right and left subtrees (If one child is missing, it should be the right one). Since we assumed that A's root is greater than B's, the heap property is also maintained.  Pseudocode for merging two min height biased leftist trees  MERGE(A, B) if A = null return B if B = null return A if A.key > B.key then SWAP (A, B) A.right := MERGE (A.right, B) // the result cannot be null since B is non-null if A.left = null then SWAP(A.left, A.right) A.s_value := 1 // since the right subtree is null, the shortest path to a descendant leaf from node A is 1 return A if A.right.s_value > A.left.s_value then SWAP (A.right, A.left) A.s_value := A.right.s_value + 1 return A  Java code for merging two min height biased leftist trees  public Node merge(Node x, Node y) { if (x  null) return y; if (y  null) return x; // if this were a max-heap, then the // next line would be: if (x.element < y.element) if (x.element.compareTo(y.element) > 0) { // x.element > y.element Node temp = x; x = y; y = temp; } x.rightChild = merge(x.rightChild, y); if (x.leftChild  null) { // left child doesn't exist, so move right child to the left side x.leftChild = x.rightChild; x.rightChild = null; // x.s was, and remains, 1 } else { // left child does exist, so compare s-values if (x.leftChild.s < x.rightChild.s) { Node temp = x.leftChild; x.leftChild = x.rightChild; x.rightChild = temp; } // since we know the right child has the lower s-value, we can just // add one to its s-value x.s = x.rightChild.s + 1; } return x; }  Example  An example of how the merge operation in a leftist tree works is depicted. The boxes represent each merge call.

In this case we swapped the subtrees rooted at nodes with keys 7 and 10. = Insertion into a Min HBLT = Insertion is done using the merge operation. An insertion of a node into an already existing Min HBLT, creates a HBLT tree of size one with that node and merges it with the existing tree. INSERT (A, x) B := CREATE_TREE(x) return MERGE(A, B) = Deletion of Min element from Min HBLT = The Min element in a Min HBLT is the root. Thus, in order to delete the Min, the root is deleted and its subtrees are merged to form the new Min HBLT. DELETE_MIN(A) x := A.key A := MERGE (A.right, A.left) return x = Initializing a height biased leftist tree = Initializing a min HBLT - Part 1 Initializing a height biased leftist tree is primarily done in one of two ways. The first is to merge each node one at a time into one HBLT. This process is inefficient and takes O(nlogn) time. The other approach is to use a queue to store each node and resulting tree. The first two items in the queue are removed, merged, and placed back into the queue. This can initialize a HBLT in O(n) time. This approach is detailed in the three diagrams supplied. A min height biased leftist tree is shown. To initialize a min HBLT, place each element to be added to the tree into a queue. In the example (see Part 1 to the left), the set of numbers [4, 8, 10, 9, 1, 3, 5, 6, 11] are initialized. Each line of the diagram represents another cycle of the algorithm, depicting the contents of the queue. The first five steps are easy to follow. Notice that the freshly created HBLT is added to the end of the queue. In the fifth step, the first occurrence of an s-value greater than 1 occurs. The sixth step shows two trees merged with each other, with predictable results. Initializing a min HBLT - Part 2 In part 2 a slightly more complex merge happens. The tree with the lower value (tree x) has a right child, so merge must be called again on the subtree rooted by tree x's right child and the other tree. After the merge with the subtree, the resulting tree is put back into tree x. The s-value of the right child (s=2) is now greater than the s-value of the left child (s=1), so they must be swapped. The s-value of the root node 4 is also now 2. Initializing a min HBLT - Part 3 Part 3 is the most complex. Here, we recursively call merge twice (each time with the right child 's subtree that is not grayed out). This uses the same process described for part 2. = Deletion of an arbitrary element from a Min HBLT = 336x336px If we have a pointer to a node x in a Min HBLT, we can delete it as follows: Replace the node x with the result of merging its two subtrees and update the s-values of the nodes on the path from x to the root, swapping the right and left subtrees if necessary to maintain the leftist tree property. The upward traversal is continued until either we hit the root or the s-values does not change. Since we are deleting an element, the S-values on the path traversed cannot be increased. Every node that is already the right child of its parent and causes its parent's s-value to be decreased, will remain on the right. Every node that is its parent's left child and causes the parent's s-value to be decreased has to be swapped with its right sibling if the s-value becomes lower than the current s-value of the right child. Each node needs to have a pointer to its parent, so that we can traverse the path to the root updating the s-values. When the traversal ends at some node y, the nodes traversed all lie on the rightmost path rooted at node y. An example is shown below. It follows that the number of nodes traversed is at most log(m), m being the size of the subtree rooted at y. Thus, this operation also takes O(lg m) to perform.  Weight biased leftist tree Leftist trees can also be weight biased. In this case, instead of storing s-values in node x, we store an attribute w(x) denoting the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at : w(x) = w(x.right) + w(x.left) + 1 WBLTs ensure w(x.left) ‚â• w(x.right) for all internal nodes x. WBLT operations ensure this invariant by swapping the children of a node when the right subtree outgrows the left one, just as in HBLT operations. = Merging two Min WBLTs = The merge operation in WBLTs can be done using a single top to bottom traversal since the number of nodes in the subtrees are known prior to recursive call to merge. Thus, we can swap left and right subtrees if the total number of nodes in the right subtree and the tree to be merged is bigger than the number of nodes in the left subtree. This allows the operations be completed in a single path and so improves the time complexity of the operations by a constant factor. The merge operation is depicted in the graph below. File:HBLT 1.jpg File:WBLT 2.jpg File:WBLT 3.jpg File:WBLT 4.jpg File:WBLT 5.jpg File:WBLT 6.jpg File:WBLT 7.jpg File:WBLT 8.jpg File:WBLT 9.jpg File:WBLT 10.jpg = Other operations on WBLT = 324x324px Insertions and deletion of the min element can be done in the same as for HBLTs using the merge operation. Although WBLTs outperform HBLTs in merge, insertion and deletion of the Min key by a constant factor, the O(log n) bound is not guaranteed when deleting an arbitrary element from WBLTs, since Œ∏(n) nodes have to be traversed. If this was an HBLT, then deleting the leaf node with key 60 would take O(1) time and updating the s-values is not needed since the length of rightmost path for all the nodes does not change. But in an WBLT tree, we have to update the weight of each node back to the root, which takes O(n) worst case.  Variants  Several variations on the basic leftist tree exist, which make only minor changes to the basic algorithm: * The choice of the left child as the taller one is arbitrary; a \\"rightist tree\\" would work just as well. * It is possible to avoid swapping children, but instead record which child is the tallest (in, for example, the least significant bit of the s-value) and use that in the merge operation. * The s-value used to decide which side to merge with could use a metric other than height. For example, weight (number of nodes) could be used.

Tree rotation In a binary search tree, a left rotation is the movement of a node, X, down to the left. This rotation assumes that X has a right child (or subtree). X's right child, R, becomes X's parent node and R's left child becomes X's new right child. This rotation is done to balance the tree; specifically when the right subtree of node X has a significantly (depends on the type of tree) greather height than its left subtree. Left rotations (and right) are order preserving in a binary search tree; it preserves the binary search tree property (an in-order traversal of the tree will yield the keys of the nodes in proper order). AVL trees and red-black trees are two examples of binary search trees that use the left rotation. A single left rotation is done in O(1) time but is often integrated within the node insertion and deletion of binary search trees. The rotations are done to keep the cost of other methods and tree height at a minimum.  References  * Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L.

From 1977 to 1991 he was the Spalding Professor of Eastern Religion and Ethics at the University of Oxford. Education Literate in Sanskrit from an early age, Matilal was also drawn towards Mathematics and Logic. He was trained in the traditional Indian philosophical system by leading scholars of the Sanskrit College, where he himself was a teacher from 1957 to 1962. He was taught by scholars like pandit Taranath Tarkatirtha and Kalipada Tarkacharya. He also interacted with pandit Ananta Kumar Nyayatarkatirtha, Madhusudan Nyayacharya and Visvabandhu Tarkatirtha. The upadhi (degree) of Tarkatirtha (master of Logic) was awarded to him in 1962. While teaching at the Sanskrit College (an affiliated college of the University of Calcutta) between 1957 and 1962, Matilal came in contact with Daniel Ingalls, an Indologist at Harvard University, who encouraged him to join the PhD program there. Matilal secured a Fulbright fellowship and completed his PhD under Ingalls on the Navya-NyƒÅya doctrine of negation, between 1962 and 1965. During this period he also studied with Willard Van Orman Quine. Subsequently, he was professor of Sanskrit at the University of Toronto, and in 1977 he was elected Spalding Professor at Oxford, succeeding Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Robert Charles Zaehner. Death Matilal died of cancer on 8 June 1991. Awards * Padma Bhushan 1990 Works by Matilal In his work, he presented Indian logic, particularly NyƒÅya-Vai≈õe·π£ika, Mƒ´mƒÅ·πÉsƒÅ and Buddhist philosophy, as being relevant in modern philosophical discourse. Matilal presented Indian Philosophical thought more as a synthesis rather than a mere exposition. This helped create a vibrant revival of interest in Indian philosophical tradition as a relevant source of ideas rather than a dead discipline.

Life Morton was born in the city of Durham. He was the youngest son of John and Grace Morton of Whickham, County Durham.Notes and Queries, 26 January 1935, p. 69. After the death of his father he was educated at Soho Square school at the charge of his uncle Maddison, a stockbroker. Here amateur acting was in vogue, and Morton, who played with Joseph George Holman, acquired a taste for the theatre. He entered at Lincoln's Inn, 2 July 1784, but was not called to the bar. His first drama, Columbus, or A World Discovered, 8vo, 1792, an historical play in five acts, founded in part upon Les Incas of Marmontel, was produced with success at Covent Garden, 1 December 1792, Holman playing the part of Alonzo. Children in the Wood, a two-act musical entertainment, Dublin, 12mo, 1794 (a pirated edition), followed at the Haymarket 1 October 1793. It was well acted by Richard Suett, John Bannister and Miss De Camp, and was more than once revived. Similar fortune attended Zorinski, 8vo, 1795, a three-act play founded on the adventures of Stanislaus, renamed Casimir, King of Poland, Haymarket, 20 June 1795. In the same year appeared an anonymous pamphlet, Mr, Morton's \\"Zorinski\\" and Brooke's \\"Gustavus Vasa\\" Compared. The Way to get Married, 8vo, 1796, a comedy in five acts, with serious situations, was produced at Covent Garden 23 January 1796, acted forty-one times, and became a stock piece. It supplied Munden with his favourite character of Caustic. A Cure for the Heart-Ache, a five-act comedy, 8vo, 1797, Covent Garden, 10 January 1797, furnished two excellent characters in Old and Young Rapid, and became also, with few other claims on attention, a stock play. Secrets worth Knowing, a five-act comedy, 8vo, 1798, Covent Garden 11 January 1798, though a better play than the preceding, was less popular. Speed the Plough, a five-act comedy, 8vo, 1798, Covent Garden, 8 Feb. 1798, was acted forty-one times, and often revived. The Blind Girl, or a Receipt for Beauty, a comic opera in three acts (songs only printed), Covent Garden, 22 April 1801, was played eight times. Beggar my Neighbour, or a Rogue's a Fool, a comedy in three acts (unprinted), Haymarket, 10 July 1802, was assigned to Morton but unclaimed by him, being damned the first night. It was afterwards converted into How to tease and how to please. Covent Garden, 29 March 1810, experienced very little better fortune, and remained unprinted. Part of the plot of Beggar my Neighbour is said to have been taken from August Wilhelm Iffland. The School of Reform, or How to rule a Husband, 8vo, 1805, a five-act comedy, was played with remarkable success at Covent Garden, 15 January 1805, and was revived so late as 20 November 1867 at the St. James's, with Mr. John S. Clarke as Tyke and Mr. Irving as Ferment. Tyke was the greatest part of John Emery. An 1822 advertisement for a performance in Jersey of Town and Country, or Which Is Best? Town and Country, or which is best ? 8vo, 1807, a comedy in five acts, was given at Covent Garden 10 March 1807, with John Kemble as Reuben Glenroy and Charles Kemble as Plastic. For this piece Harris is said to have paid ¬£1,000 whether it succeeded or failed. The Knight of Snowdoun, London, 1811, a musical drama in three acts, founded on The Lady of the Lake, saw the light at Covent Garden 5 February 1811. Education, 8vo, 1813, a five-act comedy, Covent Garden, 27 April 1813, is taken in part from Iffland. In The Slave, 8vo, 1816, Covent Garden, 12 Nov. 1816, a musical drama in three acts, Macready played Gambia, the slave. A Roland for an Oliver, 8vo, 1819, produced at Covent Garden 29 April 1819, was a two-act musical farce. In Henri Quatre, or Paris in the Olden Time, 8vo, 1820, Covent Garden, 22 April 1820, a musical romance in three acts, Macready was Henri. At the same theatre appeared School for Grown Children (8vo, 1827), on 9 January 1827, and The Invincibles, 28 February 1828, a musical farce in two acts, included in Cumberland's collection. With his second son, John Maddison Morton, he was associated in the Writing on the Wall, a three-act melodrama, produced at the Haymarket, and it is said in All that Glitters is not Gold, a two-act comic drama first played at the Olympic on 13 January 1851. Judith of Geneva, a three-act melodrama, is assigned him in Buncombe's collection, and Sink or Swim, a two- act comedy, in that of T. H. Lacy. Family Morton died on 28 March 1838, leaving a widow and three children, his second son being the farce writer, John Maddison Morton. He was a man of reputable life and regular habits, who enjoyed, two years before his death, the rarely accorded honour of being elected (8 May 1837) an honorary member of the Garrick Club. For much of his life, Thomas lived in Pangbourne in Berkshire. Works He wrote about 25 plays, several of which had great popularity, among them Columbus, or a World Discovered (1792); Children in the Wood (1793); Zorinski (1795); The Way to Get Married (1796); A Cure for the Heart Ache (1797); Speed the Plough (1798); Secrets Worth Knowing (1798); The Blind Girl, or A Receipt for Beauty (1801); The School of Reform, or How to Rule a Husband (1805); Town and Country, or Which Is Best?

Following the expulsion of the NSW branch by the Federal Executive during the Federal Conference in March 1931, the expelled branch led by Lang ran as Australian Labor Party (New South Wales) in state and federal elections. Lang Labor reconciled with Labor in February 1936. In later years, the term \\"Lang Labor\\" also included Lang and his supporters who broke away (or were expelled) from the ALP in later years, forming breakaway party Australian Labor Party (Non- Communist) between 1940 and 1941, and between 1943 and 1950. During its time, Lang Labor had representation in both state and federal parliaments. Background Lang was elected leader of New South Wales branch of the Labor Party in 1922 by the NSW party caucus, after two interim leaders had been appointed during a conflict between the NSW state executive of the party, (dominated by the Australian Workers' Union), and the ALP Federal Executive. From very early in his leadership, Lang faced opposition within the caucus due to his domineering manner. Particular areas of contention were the establishment of a Government Insurance Office and Lang's role in an attempt to increase the party's parliamentary majority through the appointment of Alick Kay as the consumer's representative on the Metropolitan Meat Board. However Lang continued to enjoy the overwhelming support of the party branches and he controlled a large majority at the annual conference, which was the party's ultimate forum. Conflict within the caucus culminated in a leadership challenge in October 1926 by Peter Loughlin, Lang's deputy leader. Lang survived this challenge on the casting vote of the Chairman. Lang responded to the challenge by calling a special meeting of the party conference in which, at his request, the conference took a supervisory role in the pre-selection of party candidates, took away from caucus the power to elect the parliamentary leader, and allowed the party leader to select the cabinet. In the press, these rule changes were referred to as \\"the red rules\\" or \\"the Lang dictatorship\\". Lang still faced significant opposition within the caucus and the caucus appointed cabinet but he was able to defeat his opponents by returning his commission as Premier to the Governor, Sir Dudley de Chair on 25 May 1927. This automatically resulted in the dismissal of the cabinet. As there was no viable alternative government, De Chair recommissioned Lang to form a caretaker government on the condition that he would recommend a dissolution of the Legislative Assembly and call an election. The new government was formed solely of Lang supporters, and Lang used the four months prior to the election to ensure that his opponents were denied ALP pre- selection. In part due to the switch to single-member electorates, the ALP lost the election. However, the ALP caucus that was elected was firmly under Lang's control, ensuring that he would dominate NSW Labor for the next 12 years. Australian Labor Party (New South Wales) With the support of the state party, the Labor Premier of New South Wales, Lang announced a policy of foreign debt repudiation, known as the \\"Lang Plan\\", and imposed a moratorium on the New South Wales government's overseas loans. This policy was in contrary to the policy of the federal Labor government led by James Scullin. In March 1931, the Federal Executive expelled the New South Wales branch from the party, including Jack Beasley and Eddie Ward, a result of its disloyalty to the federal Labor government of Scullin. The expelled branch became a separate parliamentary party known as Australian Labor Party (New South Wales), commonly known as Lang Labor. In the federal parliament, Lang Labor was led by Beasley. Lang repudiated the Premiers' Plan agreed by a meeting of the Premiers of the Australian states in June 1931 for the economic management of the Great Depression in Australia. In November 1931, Lang Labor voted with the United Australia Party (UAP) opposition to bring down the Scullin Labor government and force an early election. Lang Labor then ran candidates against the official ALP at the election. Supporters of the federal party (led in New South Wales by Ted Theodore and Ben Chifley) were known as Federal Labor candidates. The election resulted in a landslide victory for the UAP and the election of Lyons as Prime Minister. Most of the Lang members had ultra-safe working class seats and survived, although Ward was narrowly defeated in East Sydney. He would later return at the 1932 East Sydney by-election. In total, Lang Labor won four seats, while nationwide the ALP retained only 14 seats after the loss of 32 seats, and won only three seats in New South Wales. Theodore and Chifley were both defeated ending Theodore's political career. The party also ran in the 1934 federal election. Lang Labor significantly increased its total vote, and won nine seats, at the election, which saw the ALP win only one seat in New South Wales (Newcastle). At its peak, the faction held nine out of 74 seats in the House of Representatives. Lang also had some supporters outside of New South Wales, most notably several state MPs in South Australia who won elections under his banner. Reconciliation In September 1935, John Curtin succeeded Scullin as Federal Labor leader and in February 1936 he brought about a reconciliation with the New South Wales Branch after a series of \\"unity conferences\\", resulting in Labor running as a single party throughout the nation at the 1937 federal election. Lang remained as the party's state leader in New South Wales. Though Labor remained in opposition after the election, the party's competitiveness was restored with a large increase to their vote and seats held, becoming the largest single party in the House of Representatives on both votes and seats. Lang's lack of success at state elections eroded his support within the labour movement. In his 16 years as state Labor leader, he only won two elections, in 1925 and 1930; he was defeated in 1927, 1932, 1935 and 1938. This led some members of caucus, including Bob Heffron, to break away to form the Industrial Labor Party. In 1939, following intervention by the Federal Executive, the two factions were reunited at a state conference. This gathering also reversed the \\"red rules\\" and returned the power of selecting the party leader to the caucus. Lang was replaced as state leader by William McKell. Australian Labor Party (Non- Communist)1940-1941= In 1940, Lang seceded from Labor, along with several supporters, and formed a new party called the Australian Labor Party (Non-Communist), in retaliation of a policy opposing Australian involvement in World War II, adopted by the state executive. The breakaway party contested the 1940 federal election, but with only minority support in the Labor movement of NSW. Many of his old supporters such as Eddie Ward remained loyal to Australian Labor Party leader John Curtin, and Lang candidates polled poorly. The Federal Executive again intervened in the NSW branch and expelled the leftist elements. Following the Federal intervention, prior to the May 1941 state election, Lang and nearly all of his followers rejoined the ALP. The reunification would help assist Curtin to become Prime Minister of Australia in October 1941, allowing Labor to form government. =1943-1950= In 1943, having published newspaper articles attacking McKell (NSW's Premier since 1941) and Prime Minister John Curtin, Lang was expelled from the ALP and restarted the Australian Labor Party (Non-Communist). This manifestation of Lang Labor contested the 1944 NSW election, electing two members‚ÄîLang and Lilian Fowler, Australia's first female mayor. When Lang transferred to federal politics, he was succeeded as the Lang Labor member for Auburn by his son James. Although Fowler and James Lang were both re-elected in the 1947 NSW election, they were defeated in 1950, leading to the party essentially being defunct. During Lang's expulsion, the ALP continued to enjoy their greatest House of Representatives victory both in terms of proportion of seats and their strongest national two-party vote at the 1943 federal election and additionally their first successful federal re-election attempt at the 1946 federal election. During this election Lang was elected to the House of Representatives for the federal seat of Reid, being elected with the benefit of Liberal Party preferences. Lang was a nuisance to the Labor government led, since 1945, by Ben Chifley, whom he repeatedly castigated in public. He lost his seat at the 1949 election. In the double dissolution 1951 election he stood for the Senate, but was not elected. Aftermath Lang was re-admitted to the NSW branch ALP in 1971, at the age of 94, after a campaign by his prot√©g√© Paul Keating. He died four years later. ReferencesBibliography *Green, Antony (2009).

Its effect is to criminalize any further attempt by a particular mailer to continue to send advertisement material to a particular recipient through the United States Postal Service. In addition, it demands that the mailer delete immediately the names of the particular recipient from all mailing lists owned or controlled by the mailer or his agents or assigns and, further, prohibits the mailer and his agents or assigns from the sale, rental, exchange, or other transaction involving mailing lists bearing the names of the particular recipient. It is requested by filing United States Postal Service Form 1500, either with a local Postmaster, or directly with the Prohibitory Order Processing Center. Historically, the Prohibitory Order was devised as a means of protecting freedom of speech, while recognizing the rights of individual recipients not to receive advertisements they deem to be pornographic or otherwise offensive, and the absolute and unreviewable right of the recipient of a mailpiece to determine whether or not it is offensive. A prohibitory order against a specific mailer, although the language of the application form implies that explicit sexual content is the only basis for finding a mailpiece offensive, has been extended by case law to allow the recipient to declare any mailpiece obscene, for any reason whatsoever, with no requirement to state the reason(s) for taking offense. The only absolute requirement is that it must be possible to construe the mailpiece as an offer to sell goods or services. Various rulings have upheld the Supreme Court decision that the postal customer's discretion is not subject to review. In addition, recipients may use Form 1500 to apply for a general prohibitory order, covering any mailpiece that may be deemed offensive on the basis of explicit sexual content.

Max Kade (13 October 1882, Steinbach near Schw√§bisch Hall, W√ºrttemberg, Germany - 15 July 1967, Davos, Switzerland) was an emigrant from Germany to New York City who became successful in the pharmaceutical industry. Kade was committed to advancing German-American relations. He established a foundation in New York to promote scientific and technical progress and to further the peaceful coexistence of nations. Life Max Kade was born October 13, 1882 in Steinbach, a village near Schw√§bisch Hall, Germany. His father was a partner in a machine factory and iron foundry. After finishing school, Kade completed a commercial apprenticeship in his father's business. Later he lived in V√∂lklingen and Antwerp. In 1904 he emigrated to North America, living first in Montreal, then moving to New York in 1907. With a partner, he founded Seeck & Kade Inc., a pharmaceutical company, which after 1911 he directed alone. The company had great success with its cough syrup \\"Pertussin\\". On January 26, 1908 Kade married Annette Marie Baudais. They had no children. In the 1920s the couple began to lend their fortune to philanthropic and social causes. Great attention was bestowed upon his home city, Steinbach, which had become part of Schw√§bisch Hall in 1930. Kade was also an art collector and a patron of the arts who made many valuable gifts to German museums. In addition to his honorary citizenship of Steinbach (1929) and Schw√§bisch Hall (1935), Max Kade received numerous honors from the universities he aided. He died on July 15, 1967 at the age of 85 years, during a stay at a health resort in Davos, Switzerland. He was buried in Steinbach. Max Kade Foundation In 1944, Kade and his wife founded the Max Kade Foundation in New York. Following World War II, the foundation concentrated primarily on the needs of war victims and rescuing works of art and other objects of the German cultural heritage. Later it shifted its focus to supporting university activities, in particular, German-American cultural relations. One of its primary goals involves the promotion of mutual understanding of the people and cultures of Germany and the United States.

It is well known for its habit of using its wings to form a canopy when fishing. Description Lake Naivasha - Kenya In Nungwi, Zanzibar Black herons canopy feeding east of Antananarivo, Madagascar Egretta ardesiaca - MHNT The black heron is a medium-sized (42.5‚Äì66 cm in height), black- plumaged heron with black bill, lores, legs and yellow feet. In breeding plumage it grows long plumes on the crown and nape. Distribution and Habitat The black heron occurs patchily through Sub-Saharan Africa, from Senegal and Sudan to South Africa, but is found mainly on the eastern half of the continent and in Madagascar. It has also been observed in Greece. and Italy. It prefers shallow open waters, such as the edges of freshwater lakes and ponds. It may also be found in marshes, river edges, rice fields, and seasonally flooded grasslands. In coastal areas, it may be found feeding along tidal rivers and creeks, in alkaline lakes, and tidal flats. Habits The black heron uses a hunting method called canopy feeding--it uses its wings like an umbrella, creating shade that attracts fish. This technique was well documented on episode 5 of the BBC's The Life of Birds. Some have been observed feeding in solitary, while others feed in groups of up to 50 individuals, 200 being the highest number reported. The black heron feeds by day but especially prefers the time around sunset. It roosts communally at night, and coastal flocks roost at high tide. The primary food of the black heron is small fish, but it will also eat aquatic insects, crustaceans and amphibians. The nest of the black heron is constructed of twigs placed over water in trees, bushes, and reed beds, forming a solid structure. The heron nests at the beginning of the rainy season, in single or mixed-species colonies that may number in the hundreds. The eggs are dark blue and the clutch is two to four eggs.

Brisbane City Botanical Gardens. In January 1974 a flood occurred in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia after three weeks of continual rain. The Brisbane River, which runs through the heart of the city, broke its banks and flooded the surrounding areas. The cyclone that produced the flood also flooded surrounding cities: Ipswich, Beenleigh, and the Gold Coast. In total, there were 16 fatalities, 300 people injured, 8000 homes destroyed and an estimated A$980 million in damages.  Flood waters It had been an exceptionally wet spring, and by the end of October most of southern Queensland's river systems were nearing capacity. Cyclone Wanda pushed the systems to the limit, and drew the monsoonal trough southward, providing the additional rainfall to the Brisbane River, Bremer River and Stanley River catchments to produce widespread and severe flooding. In the early morning of 25 January heavy rain began to fall on Brisbane. During a 36-hour period 642 mm of rain fell on the city. These torrential rains were caused by Wanda, a relatively weak tropical cyclone which did not even rate as a category 1 cyclone. Continual, heavy rain had fallen for three weeks, leading up to the flood, which occurred on Sunday, 27 January 1974, during the Australia Day weekend. The floods peaked at according to the Port Office gauge at high tide at 2:15 am on 29 January. The peak flooding in the location of the city gauge was approximately . Damage Large areas were inundated, with at least 6,700 homes flooded. Around 13,000 buildings were affected by flooding in some way. Buildings in the Brisbane central business district were particularly hard hit. The 67,320 tonne Robert Miller broke its moorings at Kangaroo Point and became adrift in the river. Because the ship was 237 metres long and the river was about 255 metres wide, it was feared that the ship could form a dam across the river. This would have caused the river to rise by a further 3 metres, leading even greater flooding in the suburbs. Two tugboats were needed to control the 15 m high and 239 m long oil tanker. The Robert Miller was the largest ship ever built in Australia at the time. A gravel barge became caught under the Centenary Bridge where it damaged the pylons, causing fear that the bridge would be swept away. The barge was sunk to reduce the risk. The most flood affected suburb of Brisbane was Rocklea. Close to Ipswich, 1,800 premises were affected by flooding. The Nerang River flooded, cutting the Gold Coast off from Brisbane. About 2000 people were evacuated from homes along the river and the canals; most of these homes suffered flood damage. The total damage in Brisbane and the surrounding areas was initially estimated at , but the final value was over (1974 values), with made in insurance claims. While not as high as the floods in the 1800s this flood is considered to have been worse due to Brisbane's rapidly increasing population at the time. Many houses were also damaged by land subsidence and land slippage associated with the flooding and high rainfall. Fatalities Sixteen people lost their lives, including twelve people who were drowned in Brisbane and Ipswich. The first flood related deaths were at 11:20pm on 24 January. Raymond Roy Davidson (29 years, from Wacol) and Hazel Dulcie Afflick (40 years) were killed in a head-on collision at Wacol, both drivers being blinded by gale-force winds and heavy rain. An army amphibious LARC vehicle was carrying out excavation work at Bellbowrie when the vehicle hit submerged power lines which were still live. Two men, Corporal Neville Hourigan and Captain Ian Kerr of the Australian Army Reserve (then called the Citizens Military Force) were thrown from the vehicle. Bill Lickiss jumped into the water to save them. Hourigan died at the scene and Kerr's body was found after the flood had subsided. Lickiss was awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal. A young child, Shane David Patterson (of Yeronga) was swept from his father's arms on a causeway over Oxley Creek in Inala and drowned. In addition to those that drowned, Robert Adams (aged 56 years) died of a heart attack during an evacuation of a caravan park at Newmarket. Aidan Sutton, a civilian working with the Queensland Police, aged 50 years, returned home to St Lucia for his reading glasses and was swept away in the flood waters, his body found in a tree. Aftermath The Wivenhoe Dam was built approximately 80 km upstream from Brisbane after the 1974 floods. After the flood, a series of flood mitigation measures were implemented in Southeast Queensland, including the Wivenhoe Dam along the Brisbane River. The flood was a defining event for a generation of Brisbane residents with 8,500 homes flooded in Brisbane and Ipswich, 6,000 of these could not be recovered.. 4WD Australia. Retrieved on 28 April 2015. The flood had massive economic implications due to loss of export infrastructure.

Instead of HTML tables, style sheet languages such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to arrange elements and text on a web page. History HTML is a markup language whose visual presentation was initially left up to the user. However, as the Internet expanded from the academic and research world into the mainstream in the mid-1990s, and became more media oriented, graphic designers sought ways to control the visual appearance of their Web pages. As popularised especially by the designer David Siegel in his book Creating Killer Web sites, tables and spacers (usually transparent single pixel GIF images with explicitly specified width, height or margins) were used to create and maintain page layouts. In the late 1990s the first reasonably powerful WYSIWYG editors arrived on the market, which meant Web designers no longer needed a technical understanding of HTML to build web pages. Such editors indirectly encouraged extensive use of nested tables to position design elements. As designers edited their documents in these editors, unnecessary code and empty elements were added to the document. Furthermore, unskilled designers were likely to use tables more than required when using a WYSIWYG editor. This practice frequently led to many tables nested within tables, as well as tables with unnecessary rows and columns. The use of graphic editors with slicing tools that output HTML and images directly also promoted poor code with tables often having many rows of 1 pixel height or width. Sometimes many more lines of code were used to render content than the actual content itself. The reliance on tables for layout purposes caused a number of problems. Many web pages were designed with tables nested within tables, resulting in large HTML documents that use more bandwidth than documents with simpler formatting. Furthermore, when a table-based layout is linearized, for example when being parsed by a screen reader or a search engine, the resulting order of the content can be somewhat jumbled and confusing. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) were developed to improve the separation between design and content, and move back towards a semantic organization of content on the Web. The term \\"tableless design‚Äù implies the use of CSS rather than layout tables to position HTML elements on the page. HTML tables still have their legitimate place when presenting tabular information within web pages, and are also sometimes still used as layout devices in situations for which CSS support is poor or problematical, like vertically centering an element. Another area where tables are still used is e-mailers, and the reason is because many popular Email clients haven't really kept up on the modem HTML and CSS rendering. In such a scenario, complex e-mailers lose some of their structural and creative alignment. Adoption The CSS1 specification was published in December 1996 by the W3C with the aim of improving web accessibility and emphasising the separation of presentational details in style sheets from semantic content in HTML documents. CSS2 in May 1998 (later revised in CSS 2.1 and CSS 2.2) extended CSS1 with facilities for positioning and table layout. The preference for using HTML tables rather than CSS to control the layout of whole web pages was due to several reasons: * the desire of content publishers to replicate their existing corporate design elements on their web site; * the limitations at the time of CSS support in browsers; * the installed base of browsers that did not support CSS; * the new web designers' lack of familiarity with the CSS standards; * the lack of knowledge of, or concern for the reasons (including HTML semantics and web accessibility) to use CSS instead of what was perceived as an easier way to quickly achieve the intended layouts, and * a new breed of WYSIWYG web design tools that encouraged this practice. Landmarks in the adoption of CSS-based layouts include the Web Standards Project's Browser Upgrade campaign of February 2001 and the web design magazine A List Apart's simultaneous redesign, followed by the Wired redesign in 2002. The CSS Zen Garden website, launched in 2003, has been credited with popularising tableless layouts.  Rationale  The intended and semantic purpose of HTML tables lies in presenting tabular data rather than laying out pages. The benefits of using CSS for page layout include improved accessibility of the information to a wider variety of users, using a wide variety of user agents. There are bandwidth savings as large numbers of semantically meaningless , and tags are removed from dozens of pages leaving fewer, but more meaningful headings, paragraphs and lists. Layout instructions are transferred into site-wide CSS stylesheets, which can be downloaded once and cached for reuse while each visitor navigates the site. Sites may become more maintainable as the whole site can be restyled or re-branded in a single pass merely by altering the mark-up of the specific CSS, affecting every page which relies on that stylesheet. New HTML content can be added in such a way that consistent layout rules are immediately applied to it by the existing CSS without any further effort.  Advantages  Accessibility = Because of the Internet's rapid growth, expanding disability discrimination legislation, and the increasing use of mobile phones and PDAs, it is necessary for Web content to be made accessible to users operating a wide variety of devices beyond the relatively uniform desktop computer and CRT monitor ecosystem the web first became popular on. Tableless Web design considerably improves Web accessibility in this respect. Screen readers and braille devices have fewer problems with tableless designs because they follow a logical structure. The same is true for search engine Web crawlers, the software agents that most web site publishers hope will find their pages, classify them accurately and so enable potential users to find them easily in appropriate searches. As a result of the separation of design (CSS) and structure (HTML), it is also possible to provide different layouts for different devices, e.g. handhelds, mobile phones, etc. It is also possible to specify a different style sheet for print, e.g. to hide or modify the appearance of advertisements or navigation elements that are irrelevant and a nuisance in the printable version of the page. The W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines' guideline no. 3 states \\"use markup and style sheets and do so properly.\\" The guideline's checkpoint 3.3, a priority-2 checkpoint, says \\"use style sheets to control layout and presentation.\\" = Bandwidth savings = Tableless design produces web pages with fewer HTML tags used purely to position content. This normally means that the pages themselves become smaller to download. The philosophy implies that all the instructions regarding layout and positioning be moved into external style sheets. According to the basic capabilities of HTTP, as these rarely change and they apply in common to many web pages, they will be cached and reused after the first download. This further reduces bandwidth and download times across the site. = Maintainability = Maintaining a website may require frequent changes, both small and large, to the visual style of a website, depending on the purpose of the site. Under table-based layout, the layout is part of the HTML itself. As such, without the aid of template-based visual editors such as HTML editors, changing the positional layout of elements on a whole site may require a great deal of effort, depending on the amount of repetitive changes required. Even employing sed or similar global find-and-replace utilities cannot alleviate the problem entirely. In tableless layout using CSS, the layout information may reside in a CSS document. Because the layout information may be centralized, it is possible that these changes can be made quickly and globally by default. The HTML files themselves may not need to be adjusted when making layout changes. Also, because the layout information may be stored externally to the HTML, it may be quite easy to add new content in a tableless design, whether modifying an existing page or adding a new page. By contrast, without such a design, the layout for each page may require a more time-consuming manual changing of each instance or use of global find-and-replace utilities. However site owners often want particular pages to be different from others on the site either for a short period or long term. This will often necessitate a separate style sheet to be developed for that page. The page (or template) content usually can remain unaltered however, which is not the case in a tables-based design.  Disadvantages  Because CSS can be cached, an entirely CSS-based layout can be rendered improperly if changes are made and a client is still using an outdated stylesheet. This can be mitigated with careful development and use of cachebuster techniques.

It is the second stop east of Norseman on the journey east across the Nullarbor Plain. Between Balladonia and Caiguna is a stretch of the highway which is one of the longest straight stretches of road in the world. The unofficial Central Western Time (CWT) starts at Caiguna heading eastward. History The name is an Aboriginal word possibly meaning \\"spear track\\". In 1841, Edward John Eyre's party, consisting of Eyre, a man named John Baxter and three Aboriginals including one named Wylie, travelled across the Nullarbor, leaving Fowler's Bay in South Australia. On 29 April, two of the Aboriginals killed John Baxter and disappeared into the desert, taking most of the party's supplies. Due to the terrain, Baxter could not be buried, so his remains were wrapped in a blanket and left behind, and Eyre and Wylie pressed on for another month, after which they were rescued by a French vessel off Thistle Cove near modern-day Esperance, Western Australia. A memorial to Baxter is located south of the roadhouse. The townsite was established in 1962 to assist traffic crossing the Nullarbor for the Commonwealth Games in Perth. During the 1960s and 1970s, Ansett and Trans Australia Airlines domestic flights used a VOR station at Caiguna as a turning point on routes between Perth and eastern Australian capitals such as Adelaide, Melbourne, and Sydney. =Present day= As with other communities along the Eyre Highway, Caiguna today consists of little more than a roadhouse. The John Eyre Motel provides roadhouse facilities including a basic caravan park, and is one of only three Nullarbor roadhouses to be open 24 hours. A landing strip is located nearby and connects to the roadhouse with a short taxiway. The John Eyre Motel hosts a par 4 golf tee as part of the Nullarbor Links golf course. There are several nearby attractions for people crossing the Nullabor Plain. Numerous rockholes, blowholes, and gnamma holes are located on tracks off of the Eyre Highway in the vicinity of Caiguna, including the Caiguna Blowhole, and the Jillbunya and Cardanumbi Rockholes. These features were formed by years of chemical and physical weathering of the limestone bedrock of the Nullabor Plain. The Readymix logo geoglyph, created during the sealing of the Eyre Highway, lies around north west of Caiguna. Nuytsland Nature Reserve stretches along the coast of the Great Australian Bight directly south of Caiguna and contains numerous points of interest, including a Memorial to John Baxter and Toolinna Cove.

It is on Louisiana State Route 27, south of Hackberry and north of Holly Beach. The western boundary of the Sabine Refuge is Sabine Lake, the inlet for Port Arthur, Texas, while the tip of the eastern end reaches Calcasieu Lake. Southwest Louisiana National Wildlife Refuge Complex The Southwest Louisiana National Wildlife Refuge Complex was formed by administratively combining of the East Cove National Wildlife Refuge, Lacassine National Wildlife Refuge, Cameron Prairie National Wildlife Refuge, Shell Keys National Wildlife Refuge, and Sabine in 2004. Wildlife and habitat Sabine is a sanctuary, the largest coastal marsh refuge on the Gulf Coast of the United States. It is home to more than 200 species of birds, including ducks, great egrets, geese, Neotropic cormorants, raptors, snowy egrets, wading birds, and shorebirds. There is also a very large contingent of American alligators, as well as blue crabs, American mink, muskrats, coypu, North American river otters, rabbits, shrimp, and turtles. Located at the visitor center is a pamphlet that explains the Wetland Walkway, a nature trail made from concrete, a portion of which is a wooden boardwalk, located south of the refuge headquarters. It includes an observation tower and fifteen knowledge stations to educate the public about Gulf Coast marshland. A second natural trail, the Blue Goose Trail is a round trip with a scenic overlook. Petroleum exploration is allowed on the refuge. There was an oil spill at one of the well sites in Sabine during the winter of 2002‚Äì2003. Most of the spill was cleaned up by burning the oil. Hurricane damage Sabine NWR map (U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service; click for a larger view). Sabine National Wildlife Refuge was in the direct path of Hurricane Rita on September 24, 2005. All of the office buildings, visitor center, and maintenance shops were damaged beyond repair and have been removed. There are three remaining structures at the refuge headquarters area that were repaired. Recreational areas along Highway 27 received varying amounts of damage to bridges, piers, observation towers, boardwalks, restroom facilities, fences, and parking lots. Some of these facilities still require repairs and refuge staff are working with state and local partners, contractors, and other federal agencies to complete the work. West of Highway 27, Sabine refuge canals and marshes were severely affected by storm wind and water. Approximately of refuge marshes, levees, and canals were damaged. Canals and marshes are clogged with seven million cubic meters of debris from off shore rigs and coastal communities. There are both physical and chemical hazards present throughout the refuge, many of which have settled below the marsh and water surfaces. Tanks and barrels containing hazardous liquids and gases have the potential to explode or break down and release toxins into the environment. Over 1,400 hazardous material containers have been identified and are estimated to contain between 115,000 and 350,000 gallons of hazardous liquids and gases.

It is part of the AusLink road corridor between Sydney and Brisbane. The name \\"F3 Freeway\\", reflects its former route allocation, but is commonly used by both the public and the government to refer to the roadway long after the route allocation itself was no longer in use.  Route  At its southern end, the freeway starts at Pennant Hills Road, Wahroonga, near its junction with the Pacific Highway (Pearces Corner) in Sydney's north. It heads north, skirting the western edge of the Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, running parallel with the railway line until it descends to the Hawkesbury River, crossing at Kangaroo Point in Brooklyn. Immediately north of the river, the Hawkesbury River interchange provides access to Brooklyn and Mooney Mooney before the road climbs. At Mount White there are major heavy vehicle checking stations on both northbound and southbound carriageways, to assess compliance and roadworthiness of trucks. The freeway passes through the Brisbane Water National Park, and the Calga interchange gives access to Peats Ridge. The freeway then turns east to cross Mooney Mooney Creek by way of the long, high Mooney Mooney Bridge before it reaches the first major interchange on the Central Coast at Kariong. After Kariong, the freeway continues through rural and semi-rural areas of the Central Coast with interchanges at Ourimbah, Tuggerah, Warnervale and Kiar, near Doyalson. From the Doyalson interchange the freeway continues to the west of Lake Macquarie with interchanges near Morisset, Cessnock, Toronto and West Wallsend. At the West Wallsend interchange the Newcastle Link Road (A15) takes traffic into Newcastle via Wallsend and also connects with the M15 Hunter Expressway towards Kurri Kurri and Singleton, while the freeway continues north to end at the signalised intersection at the junction of Weakleys Drive and John Renshaw Drive, Beresfield. Prior to November 2018, the intersection was a roundabout and conversion and upgrade works was completed in March 2019. From here traffic bound for Highway 1 takes John Renshaw Drive and the New England Highway eastwards to meet the Pacific Highway at Hexham, and Weakleys Drive connects with the New England Highway towards Maitland. Between Wahroonga and Ourimbah the freeway passes through rugged sandstone country, particularly as it descends to and ascends from the Hawkesbury River. This section of the freeway is characterised by deep cuttings and extensive embankments. Approximate road distances (in kilometres) from Sydney of towns and cities along the Sydney- Newcastle Freeway (and Brisbane) Jolls Bridge, north of the Hawkesbury River Berowra Southbound on the Sydney-Newcastle Freeway, approaching the Mooney Mooney Bridge  History  Planning for the freeway began in 1952, with the aim of providing a high-speed replacement for a section of the Pacific Highway that had been built in 1925‚Äì30 which was struggling to cope with the increased traffic. It was planned that the freeway would connect to the freeway systems being proposed for both Sydney and Newcastle, providing a city-to-city freeway link. The route between Mount White and Kariong was originally planned to be further south than the route as built, with an easier crossing of Mooney Mooney Creek. By the time that construction on this section was to begin, resistance from the National Parks & Wildlife Service to the proposed route forced the Department of Main Roads to take a route through Calga, using part of the first stage of a proposed freeway route to Singleton which had been built the 1960s. That scheme has never been further developed. The route through Wyong Shire also changed; instead of passing east of Wyong along the western edge of the Tuggerah Lakes, development in that area forced the freeway to be moved to the west of Wyong, with link roads being constructed to meet the Pacific Highway near Doyalson and Tuggerah. In addition, the freeway was revised to go to the west of Lake Macquarie rather than the east, and thereby bypass Newcastle. One of the reasons for this change of location was the issue of connectivity to the Pacific Highway north of Newcastle, as the route of the Newcastle Inner City Bypass, which would have provided a northern extension of the freeway, is problematic in terms of its northern terminus point at Sandgate not easily allowing for a northward freeway-standard route to join to the Pacific Highway. The sections of the Newcastle Inner City Bypass from the Pacific Highway at to and from Jesmond to have since been constructed, while the original freeway route between Belmont and Bennetts Green and then northward to the Pacific Highway at Merewether Heights is still reserved from development, with the possibility that it could be constructed in the future. The major stages in the construction of the freeway were: *April 1963 ‚Äì Construction began on the section from the Hawkesbury River to Mount White. This was opened as a toll road in December 1965. *October 1966 ‚Äì Opening of the Mount White-Calga section (including first section of proposed freeway to link to the New England Highway at Singleton). *December 1968 ‚Äì Opening of Berowra to Hawkesbury River section as a toll road. *October 1973 ‚Äì Completion of the Brooklyn Bridge, thereby connecting the Berowra-Hawkesbury River and Hawkesbury River-Calga sections. At this time the separate tolls for the sections north and south of the Hawkesbury (20 cents for each section) were abolished and a single toll of 50 cents was introduced. This was collected at the Berowra toll booths, and the Mooney Mooney toll booths were removed. The toll was removed in 1990 when the Federal Government adopted a policy that a condition of its direct funding of the national highways was that they were to be toll free. *December 1983 ‚Äì Concurrent opening of the Somersby to Ourimbah and Kangy Angy to Wallarah Creek sections, including the single carriageway motorway link from Wallarah Creek to the Pacific Highway at Doyalson. *December 1986 ‚Äì Opening of the section between Calga and Somersby including the Mooney Mooney Bridge. *September 1987 ‚Äì Freeway completed from Wallarah Creek interchange to Mandalong Road interchange. *March 1988 ‚Äì Freeway completed from Mandalong Road interchange to Freemans Waterhole interchange. *March 1989 ‚Äì Wahroonga to Berowra section opened *December 1990 ‚Äì Section from Freemans Waterhole Interchange to Palmer's Road completed. *December 1993 ‚Äì Palmer's Road to Minmi section opened. *December 1997 ‚Äì \\"Missing link\\" between Ourimbah and Kangy Angy opened. *November 1998 ‚Äì Final stage of freeway opened between Minmi and John Renshaw Drive, Beresfield. The motorway has also undergone several upgrades: *December 2004 ‚Äì Completion of widening to six lanes of the four-lane sections between the Hawkesbury River and Calga. As part of this work, a new south bound truck weighing station was built at Mount White to replace the facility at Berowra. The station was built on the existing two-lane alignment, and a new three-lane south bound alignment was built for car traffic. *November 2009 ‚Äì Completion of widening to six lanes of the four-lane sections between Wahroonga and the Hawkesbury River, resulting in a continuous six lane width over the from Wahroonga to Kariong. RTA F3 Project Information This work was completed in three stages; stage 1 ‚Äì Cowan to Berowra (), completed September 2008, stage 2 ‚Äì Berowra to Mount Kuring-Gai (), completed September 2009) and stage 3 ‚Äì Mount Kuring-Gai to Mount Colah (), completed November 2009. * August 2013 ‚Äì road signs were changed to show the new M1 marker and the new name \\"Pacific Motorway\\" as part of a new statewide alpha numeric route scheme. * March 2019 ‚Äì Replacement of the roundabout on Pacific Motorway, John Renshaw, and Weakleys Drives with a signalised intersection. * May 2020 - Completion of widening the Pacific Motorway to three lanes in each direction from Kariong to Somersby. * June 2020 - Completion of Widening the Pacific Motorway to three lanes in each direction from Tuggerah to Doyalson. = \\"F3\\" designation = The northbound and southbound cafes at the interchange are called \\"Cafe F3\\", reflecting the road's former route allocation and its common name. In addition to the National Highway 1 designation, the freeway at one stage carried the Freeway Route 3 (F3) designation. This route numbering system, introduced in 1971, was to provide distinctive route numbering and signage for freeways in Sydney and the surrounding areas. Although the route was never signed with the F3 route marker (the numbering system was removed in the late 1980s), the route is still often referred to as the F3 Freeway, with this title being used not only colloquially but on state and federal government documents and web sites and some road signs.  Proposed upgrades and connections  Core sampling in preparation for construction of the Hunter Expressway Strong public resistance in the 1970s to freeways being constructed within cities and unfavourable outcomes of government inquiries resulted in several freeway proposals in Sydney being abandoned. This included the connecting the Lane Cove Valley and North Western Expressways, which means that the Pacific Highway (a six lane urban arterial) continues to be the connecting route between the freeway's southern terminus at Wahroonga and the city centre. However plans are currently being developed for extensions at both ends of the M1: * The Federal Government supports the concept of a Sydney Bypass proposal, being a motorway connecting the M1 Pacific Motorway at Wahroonga with the M7 and thus the Hume Highway, leading southwest from Sydney towards Canberra and Melbourne. It has funded studies to identify options for such a connection. It will be a pair of tunnels connecting the Motorway at Pearces Corner, Wahroonga to the M2 Motorway near the Pennant Hills Road interchange. Federal minister's press release Due to community concern, Mahla Pearlman carried out an independent review which was completed in August 2007. The review concluded that the proposed tunnels should proceed as proposed under Pennant Hills Road, but urged that planning for the longer term connection between the F3 and the M7 should also commence immediately. On 16 March 2014, the preferred contractor for construction of the NorthConnex link was announced. * As part of the upgrade of the Pacific Highway between Hexham and the New South Wales/Queensland border, a freeway extension is proposed to be constructed between the F3 at Black Hill (close to its current northern terminus) and the Raymond Terrace bypass. F3 to Pacific Highway route study This section is currently a major bottleneck during holiday and long weekend periods, with delays lasting hours not uncommon. The layout of the twin bridges across the Hunter River at Hexham was designed primarily for local traffic to and from Newcastle, rather than to connect the Pacific Highway north of Newcastle to the freeway. This freeway extension is not anticipated to be constructed until after 2026.Minmi/Link Road and Stockrington Concept Plan, Page 102 , Coal & Allied Industries, Retrieved on 31 December 2013.  Traffic disruption  Other than the Pacific Highway, which the freeway has superseded, the freeway is the only direct route between Sydney and the Central Coast, and is the major road route for road transport from Sydney to the Hunter region, northern NSW and Queensland. The freeway thus carries a heavy mix of commuter traffic, road freight transport, and (periodically) holiday and recreational travellers. It often suffers from traffic disruptions, generally associated with traffic volume and congestion related to on-road breakdowns and vehicle accidents, or natural disasters (in particular, bushfire).

Motorways and heavy vehicle safety: The F3 Sydney ‚Äì Newcastle Freeway. Paper presented to the NSW Department of Emergency Services seminar on the F3 Freeway Heavy Vehicle Safety and Emergency Management, held at Berowra NSW, Saturday 27 June 2009. In addition traffic on the freeway is frequently affected by vehicle crashes, often involving trucks.The Age news story on crash 31 January 2008 These events have encouraged the NSW motoring organisation NRMA to call for more freight to be moved by rail to reduce the number of trucks using the freeway. Bushfires have caused closure of the freeway and the nearby railway line and Pacific Highway between Sydney and the Hawkesbury River on a number of occasions. One such event of this type was recorded on 21 and 22 January 2007, when a fire broke out in the adjoining Kuring-gai Chase National Park. The fire forced the closure of the two roads and the railway line between Sydney and the Central Coast, resulting in extended disruption to traffic flow. Because of the frequency of these disruptions to traffic flow, arguments for a second major freeway north from the Sydney metropolitan area continue to be pushed forward.Pearlman review of F3 to M7 Corridor Selection, published August 2007 However topography and resultant cost rules this out for practical purposes, other than indirect routes crossing the Hawkesbury in the vicinity of Wiseman's Ferry, some 30 km upstream of the current crossing. Following criticism of significant delays due to accidents and blockages, the NSW Roads and Traffic Authority (RTA) is in the process of constructing a $28 million emergency plan for the freeway which involves development of a 40 km/h contraflow traffic scheme to allow vehicles to travel around an accident.http://163.189.7.150/constructionmaintenance/majorconstructionprojectsregional/centralcoast/f3/f3_tmp.html F3 Freeway emergency traffic management plan  Traffic volume  The Annual average daily traffic (AADT) data from the Roads & Traffic Authority showed a decline in traffic volume on the freeway near its southern end at Wahroonga, from 78,600 in 2002 to about 76,600 in 2005 and then to 75,800 in 2006. The 2004 AADT figures for other locations on the freeway include 73,400 at Mooney Mooney, just north of the Hawkesbury River bridge, 60,100 near Wyong, 38,500 near Wyee, 27,000 near Freemans Waterhole and 33,000 near its northern terminus at Beresfield.

It is the third stop after Norseman on the journey east across the Nullarbor Plain. The area is noted for its caves and lakes. It is the nearest locality to the south coast feature of Twilight Cove, which is 26 km to the south. Cocklebiddy follows the time zone used by Eucla of UTC+8:45. https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-04-08/this-remote-stretch-of-desert-has-its- own-custom-time-zone/10981000 History Cocklebiddy started as an Aboriginal mission station, of which only the stone foundations remain today. The area was thought to be a potential water source and, during World War II, Army engineers attempted to tap fresh water from the lakes, but it was found that a thin skin of fresh water overlay a vast volume of saline water. The Eyre Telegraph Station, located south of the settlement, operated from 1897 until 1929. Unlike most others, it remained in a relatively well-preserved state due to its isolation and protection from the Southern Ocean, and in 1976, when the State Government created the Nuytsland Nature Reserve, the facility was converted into a wildlife observatory, known as Eyre Bird Observatory, which opened in 1978. The observatory offers basic camping facilities. Over 230 species of birds have been spotted there. Present day The playground at the roadhouse. Like other locations in the Nullarbor Plain area, the area consists of little more than a roadhouse. The current business name of the roadhouse is the Wedgetail Inn and like most other Nullarbor establishments has access to satellite television, as well as providing caravan park, and hotel motel facilities. The Cocklebiddy area is noted for its caves, the most notable of which is Cocklebiddy cave ‚Äì a single passage more than 6 km long, of which around 90% is underwater and only accessible via cave diving. In August 1983, a French team set a world record here for the longest cave dive in the world. In October that year, the French record was beaten by an Australian team when Hugh Morrison of Western Australia pushed another 280 metres beyond where the French had tied off. In 1995 South Australian cave diver Christopher Brown went another 20 metres further again, and in late 2008 much of the cave's more distant regions were explored, mapped (using radio-location \\"pingers\\" designed and operated by Ken Smith) and videotaped by Craig Challen and Richard Harris et al. using rebreather technologies. (Challen and Harris would later be better known for their involvement in the 2018 Tham Luang cave rescue.) Cocklebiddy was visited in 2007 by the Australian comical duo, Hamish and Andy. A number of five unique species of Restionaceae (a tussock-like plant) named Harperia, Loxocarya, Onychosepalum, Platychorda and Tremulinawere exist 15‚Äì20 kilometres in a somewhat south westerly direction of Cocklebiddy.

It is one of two high schools in the Englewood Schools District. Its enrollment is approximately 600 students in grades 9-12. There are about 65 licensed teachers, 40 of whom hold a master's degree or higher. The school is accredited by the North Central Association of Secondary Schools and the Colorado Department of Education, and holds membership in the College Board, the National Alliance of High Schools, and the National Association of College Admissions Counselors. The school was founded in 1913. Englewood has more Boettcher Scholars than any other metro area high school, with 30. History Englewood High's original location was at Broadway and Kenyon Avenues. As enrollment increased, the school grew out of its original building, and in 1953, construction on a new building began. The class of 1954 was the first to move into the new building, which still stands today. In the early 1960s the school renovated its structure, adding a full-size auditorium, library, and more classrooms. The school is currently located in Englewood at the corner of Mansfield Avenue and Logan Street. Next to the campus is the Hosanna Athletic Complex, which contains the baseball and soccer fields. In 2005, a new artificial turf field was installed at a cost of $600,000. Until September 17, 2008 the principal of Englewood High had been Linda Torres. She resigned due to personal reasons, and was replaced by Vice Principal Davis.http://englewood.k12.co.us/ehs/ The new 239,000 square foot campus, dedicated February 7, 2015, located at the corner of Mansfield Avenue and Logan Street, now accommodates roughly 1,250 students from the high school, Englewood Middle School and Englewood Leadership Academy. Extracurricular activitiesAthletics= Englewood competes in 2A, 3A, 4A and 5A athletics and is a member of the Colorado High School Activities Association. Football After failing to win a single game from 1988 until their demotion, Englewood finally managed to turn their program around, losing two regular season games combined in the 1995 and 1996 seasons and only six total from 1993-1996. 1996 was the first conference championship in over 40 years won by the Pirates, which included an 11-game win streak and a run to the state semi-finals for 3A football. Both '95 & '96 seasons ended with losses to the eventual state Champion and four-time consecutive champion, Palisade High School. Both 1995 and 1996 Englewood teams had several players named to 1st and 2nd All-State teams along with the first ever All-Colorado award for an EHS player in 1996. Many players went on to play in college from those years, as well as at schools including Colorado College, Ft. Hayes St, Occidental College. In 2006-2007 the Englewood High School football team won the 3A North Metro League with a record of 8-2, and lost in the second round of the playoffs, with a final season record of 9-3. In 2008, Englewood's head football coach, Randy Penn retired after winning Coach of the Year in 3A football. The Pirates' new head football coach is Coach Graves, who was a coach at Columbine High School before taking the role of head Pirate. Graves is joined by returning coach Randy Penn and many former players and coaches. The light towers at the Englewood High School football stadium were originally erected in the late 1930s at the University of Denver's Hilltop Stadium, which stood from 1926 to 1971. When the Hilltop Stadium was gradually razed between 1971 and 1974, the light towers were donated to Englewood HS. =Lacrosse= In 2007 the lacrosse team finished with a record of 2-13, picking up their first win in four years. The team that year was led by seniors Karl Kirsch and Dylan McAninch. Kirsch had 18 goals and five assists, and McAninch had three goals and 13 assists. In 2008 the Pirates went 0-14, but showed signs of greatness in midfielder Brandon Pollack and defender turned midfielder Dean McAninch. In the 2009 season the Pirates again went 0-14, but had a strong season with defender Dean McAnich being named to the North All-Stars team. During the 2015 season the Pirates lacrosse team went 10-6, winning their first league title in over 30 years by defeating top-ranked league teams such as Denver South and Lutheran Parker. This was a big improvement from the previous year's 4-9 record. The team was led by junior midfielder Caleb Medina and senior attackman Austin Trail, who both made the all-state lacrosse team. The Pirates had an amazing turnaround season, thanks to Coach Matt Thomas and Todd Porter, plus the support from the Englewood community. =Wrestling= In 2008 Justin Williams went 40-6 in his wrestling season. He then went to the state finals and took second. In 2009 Williams went 40-1, and went on to win the 285 state championship. He finished with a 123-36 career record with 76 pins. He holds the single season and career pins record for Englewood High School. =Boys' soccer= The 2008 season showed the slow downfall of what used to be a great soccer team. With the loss of Head Coach Albert Adetoye, the Pirates saw a lack of hard work and drive. The lack of leadership and upperclassmen help is another reason for the downfall of the Pirates. They fielded a young team in the 2008 season. Several sophomores started and there were several young players with a lot of potential. =Boys' basketball= They head coach of the boys' basketball team is Stu Howard. The team went 11-12 in the 2007 season and made it to the playoffs, where they lost to the Greeley West Spartans by a score of 79-46. The Pirates had two returning varsity starters from the previous year, as well as some young talent that would step up to the varsity level. =Activities= Englewood has many student clubs and activities. One is the award-winning Pirateer student newspaper, considered one of the best in the state and part of the High School National Ad Network. The Pirateers advisor, Sheila Jones, received the Don Ridgway Freedom of Expression Award in 2000 and was named the Colorado Publications Teacher of the Year in 2001. In 2009, Jones received the CHSPA Medal of Merit, and upon her retirement in 2012, the national Journalism Education Association honored her with its Lifetime Achievement award. JJ (Janet) Ogrin now serves as the Pirateer advisor, supervising all aspects of the convergent media program that Jones initiated. Ogrin, a Colorado native, in high school was named the Colorado High School Journalist of the year for her work on the Rocky Mountain High School (Ft. Collins) Highlighter newspaper. She then was a finalist for the national journalist of the year award. The Pirateer can now be accessed online at pirateer.net. The Pirate band regularly competes in state competitions and has won numerous awards.

On 14 April 1939, Germany instituted the Spanish Cross as a decoration for the German airmen and soldiers who fought in the Condor Legion during the war. A number of German Navy ships served in Spanish waters, their crew also qualifying for the cross. The Spanish Cross was to be worn on the right breast below the pocket flap or, if awarded, below the Blood Order. After the death of the recipient, the award remains with the next-of- kin. The wear of Nazi era awards was banned in 1945. The Spanish Cross was not among those awards reauthorised for official wear by the Federal Republic of Germany in 1957.  Classes  The Spanish Cross filled the dual role of gallantry decoration and campaign medal. The Cross was awarded in Gold, Silver and Bronze classes to reflect the rank or merit of the recipient. The Silver and Bronze classes were awarded with and without swords, the Gold only with swords. For outstanding bravery in combat, the Gold class could be awarded with diamonds. Each class, and the numbers awarded, were: = Bronze = The non-combatant version was awarded without swords to military personnel or civilian technicians for three months of service in Spain without combat experience. 7,869 bronze crosses were awarded.  Bronze with Swords  The Spanish Cross in Bronze with Swords was given to individuals involved in front line combat during the war. 8,462 bronze crosses with swords were awarded. = Silver = The Silver Cross without swords was a non-combatant version awarded for merit. 327 silver crosses were awarded.  Silver with Swords  The Spanish Cross in Silver was awarded to servicemen who took part in decisive battles or had considerable fighting experience. 8,304 silver crosses with swords were awarded. = Gold = The Spanish Cross in Gold was awarded, only with swords, to servicemen who showed great merit in combat or exceptional leadership. 1,126 gold crosses were awarded.  Gold with Diamonds  The Spanish Cross in Gold with Swords and Diamonds was the highest grade of the decoration. It was awarded to those who showed great leadership skills in battle or great merit. 28 gold crosses with diamonds were awarded, one of which was presented to Adolf Galland. = Next of Kin = A Cross of Honour for relatives of the German dead in Spain () was awarded to relatives of servicemen who died during their service in Spain. 315 next of kin crosses were awarded.  Design  The Spanish Cross is a Maltese cross with, in its centre, a swastika on a roundel. Between each arm of the cross is the Luftwaffe eagle and, for the versions with swords, two crossed swords, placed behind the eagle symbols. The diamond class had brilliants placed around the swastika in the central roundel. The reverse side is plain and has a pin used for wearing the cross on the uniform. The cross for next of kin is bronze and similar to the cross without swords, but smaller in size. Unlike the others, it is attached to a ribbon in black with edges in red, yellow, and red (the colours of the Spanish flag).

He began as the cross country and track head coach for the University in 1972 and became head track coach in 1978. McDonnell retired after the 2008 NCAA Outdoor Championships.  Early life  McDonnell earned his bachelor's degree from Southwestern Louisiana (now Louisiana-Lafayette) in 1969. While competing to become a six- time all-American in track and cross country at USL, he became the 1966-67 AAU 3,000-meter champion, and won the mile at the 1966 British Selection Games. He coached at New Providence (N.J.) High School (1969‚Äì70) and Lafayette (La.) High School (1971) before coming to the University of Arkansas.  Coaching accomplishments at Arkansas  McDonnell was hired as the cross country coach in 1972 and added the entire men's track and field program in 1978. Coach McDonnell led the track team to their first national championship at the 1984 NCAA Indoor Championships while the school was a member of the now-defunct Southwest Conference. Since then, the University of Arkansas has won 40 NCAA championships, including 11 cross country, 19 indoor track and 10 outdoor track. Other schools have won only 24 combined NCAA titles in the three sports during the same period.

Created in 1975, the Wilderness is managed by both the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service and contains some of the most spectacular sections of the Snake River as it winds its way through Hells Canyon, North America's deepest river gorge and one of the deepest gorges on Earth. The Oregon Wilderness Act of 1984 added additional acreage and currently the area protects a total area of . It lies entirely within the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area except for a small plot in southeastern Wallowa County, Oregon which is administered by the Bureau of Land Management. The area that is administered by the Forest Service consists of portions of (in descending order of acreage) the Wallowa, Nez Perce, Payette, and Whitman National Forests. Topography The Oregon portion of Hells Canyon Wilderness is characterized by two steep breakland areas in excess of 60 percent paralleling the Snake River. These are separated by a benchland at mid-elevation between the river and canyon rim between Saddle Creek and Dug Bar. The dominant vegetation is native bunchgrasses and shrubs. Trees are scattered throughout the Oregon side of the Wilderness, but concentrated on north-facing slopes and in stream bottoms - primarily ponderosa pine and Douglas fir. The three topographic provinces are dissected by many drainages including Saddle, Temperance, Salt, and Sluice Creeks. The Idaho portion of Hells Canyon Wilderness is characterized by three geologic- vegetative regions. The upper areas are alpine and subalpine with several lakes and geologic formations of glacial origin. Vegetation is sparse and broken by large areas of rock. The middle portions contain dense forests of larch, lodgepole pine, and true firs. Lower elevations are characterized by dry, rocky, barren, steep slopes breaking into the Snake River and its major tributaries. Trees are sparse, consisting mostly of ponderosa pine and Douglas fir. This entire area is dissected by several major drainages including Sheep Creek, Granite Creek, and Deep Creek. The highest peaks are the Seven Devils Mountains, the tallest is \\"He Devil\\" at above sea level. Human history Humans have historically used the Hells Canyon Wilderness area for farming, ranching and mining activities. Historically sheep and cattle have grazed this area of Northeastern Oregon since the 1730s as the Nez Perce grazed horses and cattle in the main canyons. By the 1800s homesteaders on the Oregon benchland were grazing sheep, cattle, and horses throughout the valley and canyons. Cattle grazing continues today in a small portion of the Wilderness, as permitted in the 1964 Wilderness Act, which allows some traditional activities to continue as long as wilderness values are not compromised. Some mining has also occurred, primarily on the Idaho side of the Wilderness. Vegetation Prickly pear cactus. A variety of vegetation grows in Hells Canyon Wilderness. Sagebrush and bunchgrass grow in lower parts of the canyon with deciduous bushes and trees along the numerous streams that run into Hells Canyon. Engelmann spruce and sub-alpine fir grow at the highest levels of the Wilderness, with western larch, Douglas fir, and ponderosa pine found between the two extremes. Prickly pear cactus and poison ivy are fairly common as well. Wildlife Wildlife is abundant in Hells Canyon Wilderness. Black bear, cougar, elk, deer, mountain goat, chukar, and bighorn sheep are common. There have been reports, documented as recently as the late 1970s by local Forest Service and agriculture workers, of grizzly bears in the Wilderness. Wolves have established small packs in the area, and moose, peregrine falcon, bald and golden eagles can also be seen. Recent research has photodocumented the presence of wolverines. Wild and Scenic Rivers Rafting the Wild and Scenic Snake River. Three National Wild and Scenic Rivers run through the Wilderness - the Snake, Imnaha, and Rapid rivers. =Snake River= of the Snake River, from Hells Canyon Dam downstream, are designated Wild and Scenic. are designated \\"wild\\" and are designated \\"scenic.\\" =Imnaha River= of the Imnaha River from its headwaters are designated Wild and Scenic.

In 1988, were designated \\"wild,\\" were designated \\"scenic,\\" and were designated \\"recreational,\\" though only a portion of the Wild and Scenic Imnaha is located within Hells Canyon Wilderness. =Rapid River= of Idaho's Rapid River from the headwaters of the main stem to the National Forest boundary, and the segment of the West Fork from the wilderness boundary to the confluence with the main stem, are designated \\"wild.\\" The river contains three threatened fish species - chinook salmon, steelhead, and bull trout. Recreation Horses in the wilderness There are approximately of trails crossing Hells Canyon Wilderness. The extensive trail system mostly follows old Forest Service access routes to fires, and stock trails used by ranchers to move livestock to remote salting areas and watering holes. Many routes follow ridges and traverse moderate slopes and benchlands, while others climb steep slopes. These trails are extreme in difficulty, and any water sites should be viewed with skepticism, especially in mid summer to mid fall. Prohibited activities U.S. Wilderness Areas do not allow motorized or mechanized vehicles, including bicycles. Although camping, hunting, and fishing are allowed with proper permit, no roads or buildings are constructed and there is no logging or mining, in compliance with the 1964 Wilderness Act.

The Jathaa follows a strict discipline in keeping the Rehit of Guru Gobind Singh Jee. They also enjoy an active style of Keertan recited by Sikhs in a collective manner in front of Sree Guru Granth Sahib Jee. This style of Keertan is relatively simple, and the entire congregation devotionally participates in singing along. The Jatha‚Äôs purpose is to provide Sikhs around the world with Sangat (companionship with enlightened souls), just like any other Jatha or group within the greater Khalsa Panth. The Jatha organizes Kirtan Smagams in dozens of cities around the world, spreading the transformative power of lovingly sung Gurbani to all. The Jatha also has a strong focus on the Sikh lifestyle or Sikh Rehit. The Jathaa follows a strict discipline in keeping the Rehit of Guru Gobind Singh Jee. They also enjoy an active style of Keertan recited by Sikhs in a collective manner in front of Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji. This style of Keertan is relatively simple, and the entire congregation devotionally participates in singing along. Bhai Sahib Bhai Randheer Singh Jee embodied this lifestyle of strict personal discipline. He wrote many articles on Gurbaanee and the Sikh Lifestyle. He was a dedicated Gursikh who fought injustice and always remained in Chardee Kalaa (high spirits). History The Jatha (group) was started in the late 1800s, when Mata Gulab Kaur, a spiritually enlightened Gursikh woman asked Bhai Randhir Singh to re-invigorate the Khalsa Panth with Kirtan. =Bhai Sahib Bhai Randhir Singh Ji= Bhai Sahib Bhai Randhir Singh Ji Bhai Randhir Singh ji (1878‚Äì1961) was from Ludhiana. He opposed the British rule and was imprisoned by the British authorities in 1914 till 1931. Bhai Randhir Singh was given the title of ‚ÄúBhai Sahib‚Äù and the suffix ‚ÄúJi‚Äù from the Panth as he was honoured by all the 4 ‚ÄúTakhts‚Äù (5th Takhat was ordained later on) or supreme centres for Sikhs for committing his life for the sacrifice of the Panth and always propagating the true message of Gurmat and inspiring people to take Amrit. Bhai Randhir Singh and Bhai Veer Singh were the only Sikhs to receive this title in the 20th century. Bhai Sahib Randhir Singh ji was very prominent in the Panthik arena. There was wide recognition of his high Jeevan and Panthik Kurbani. Many of the jatha went to jail in the anti ‚Äì British movement, and suffered a lot of torture. Bhai Sahib and Baba Attar Singh with many other Gursikhs had brought a lot of change in the Panth via the Gurdwara Sudhaar Movement. They worked under the banner of the Panch Khalsa Divan. =Akhand Kirtani Jatha (AKJ)= For a long time, the Jatha did not have an official name. In the past, it was often referred to as the ‚ÄúWaheguru Singhs‚Äù. In one such text, this was because people would say that everywhere these Gursikhs went, they would walk, talk, work, sleep, with Waheguru resounding around them. Other names for the Jatha have included the Nirban Kirtani Jatha and ‚ÄúBhai Randhir Singh da Jatha‚Äù. The name AKJ only became common when Bhai Randhir Singh started doing Kirtan in all of the historical Gurdwaras. It was when Bhai Sahib started doing his marathon non-stop kirtan sessions that the name Akhand Kirtani Jatha (non-stop kirtan group) became prominent and was used often by the SGPC officials and the historical Gurdwaras where they performed Kirtan. This was how the name Akhand Kirtani Jatha came into existence. Bhai Sahib never named the Jatha and only referred to it as ‚Äòthe Jatha‚Äô, a name commonly used in India, which means a group. The name was started by Parbandaks and managers of the Gurdwaras; later it got registered in the 1970s, as was the case with most panthic groups. Today it is a worldwide organization which spreads the message of Shabad Guru, and considers itself a part of the Khalsa Panth and not a separate entity. Beliefs AKJ follows the rules (Panthic Rehit Maryada) set by SGPC. The Jatha fully align itself with Sri Akaal Takhat Sahib and the Khalsa Panth. Jatha views itself as being completely under the umbrella of Sri Akaal Takhat Sahib and the Khalsa Panth. > The four transgressions, which must be avoided are: (1) Dishonouring the > hair, (2) Eating Kuttha, (3) Intimate relationship with a person other than > one‚Äôs spouse, and (4) Using tobacco (i.e. intoxicants). In addition to the Sikh Rehit Maryada, AKJ follows a stricter form of rehit which = Nitnem Banis = AKJ follows the Nitnem maryada followed by the Sikh panth. The 5 Banis recited every morning are the same Banis that are recited when preparing Amrit during Amrit ceremony. A Gurskh learns from the Amrit Sanchaar that the Banis being read there should be read every day so that the internal Amrit is experienced every day. The Nitnem banis read everyday by Gursikhs in AKJ are: # Japji Sahib # Jaap Sahib # Tav Prasad Savaiye # Chaupai Sahib # Anand Sahib # Rehraas Sahib # Kirtan Sohila In addition to the following banis, sikhs try to add as many banis as possible to their daily rehit. =Vegetarianism= Eating \\"Kuttha\\" meat is prohibited in Sikh Rehit Maryada. The Sikh Rehat Maryada and some Sikh scholars define Kutthaa as meat \\"slaughtered in the Muslim way\\" (Halaal meat).Punjabi-English Dictionary, Punjabi University, Dept. of Punjabi Lexicography, Published Dec. 1994. Kuttha: meat of animal or fowl slaughtered slowly as prescribed by Islamic law.Sikhism, A Complete Introduction, Dr. H.S.Singha & Satwant Kaur, Hemkunt Press - We must give the rationale behind prescribing jhatka meat as the approved food for the Sikhs. According to the ancient Aryan Hindu tradition, only such meat as is obtained from an animal which is killed with one stroke of the weapon causing instantaneous death is fit for human consumption. However, with the coming of Islam into India and the Muslim political hegemony, it became a state policy not to permit slaughter of animals for food, in any other manner, except as laid down in the Quran - the kosher meat prepared by slowly severing the main blood artery of the throat of the animal while reciting verses from the Quran. It is done to make slaughter a sacrifice to God and to expiate the sins of the slaughter. Guru Gobind Singh took a rather serious view of this aspect of the whole matter. He, therefore, while permitting flesh to be taken as food repudiated the whole theory of this expiatory sacrifice and the right of ruling Muslims to impose it on the non- Muslims. Accordingly, he made jhatka meat obligatory for those Sikhs who may be interested in taking meat as a part of their food. The Jatha believes that Kutthaa means ‚Äúkilled meat‚Äù (i.e. killed in any way). Thus, the code of vegetarianism is followed by Akhand Kirtani Jatha. = Keski as Kakaar = According to the Panthic Sikh Rehit Maryada, published by the SGPC, the five K‚Äôs are: > I. The Keshas (unshorn hair), II. The Kirpan {sheathed sword} (The length of > the sword to be worn is not prescribed., III. The Kachhehra (The Kachhehra > (drawers like garment) may be made from any cloth, but its legs should not > reach down to below the shins.), IV. The Kanga (comb), V. The Karha {steel > bracelet} (The Karha should be of pure steel.) The Jatha, believes Keski is Kakkaar, not Kesh. They base this on references in the historical text of ‚ÄúGuru Kian Sakhian‚Äù (also known as ‚ÄúBhatt Vehee‚Äù) and other Rehatnamas. Promoting the wearing of a Keski (turban) shows greater respect and reverence for the sacred hair. It also helps avoid the violation of damaging or dishonouring one's hair which is one of the 4 Bajjar Kurehits (cardinal sins), according to Sikh Rehit Maryada. = Raagmala = The Panthic Sikh Rehat Maryada states: > \\"The reading of the whole Guru Granth Sahib (intermittent or non-stop) may > be concluded with the reading of Mundawani or the Rag Mala according to the > convention traditionally observed at the concerned place. (Since there is a > difference of opinion within the Panth on this issue, nobody should dare to > write or print a copy of the Guru Granth Sahib excluding the Rag Mala). > Thereafter, after reciting the Anand Sahib, the Ardas of the conclusion of > the reading should be offered and the sacred pudding (Karhah Prashad) > distributed.\\" Raagmala is the title of a composition of twelve verses, running into sixty lines, appended to Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji as a table or index of raags that appears after the ‚ÄúMundaavni‚Äù, i.e. the epilogue or ‚Äúclosing seal‚Äù. The authorship of Raagmala has been the subject of controversy; more so the point of whether it should form part of the recitation of Gurbani in its entirety (i.e. being included in Sehaj Paath or Akhand Paath bhog/completion). The Jatha, do not believe in Raagmala being composed or written by the Guru Sahibs, but was added to Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji at a later date. Consequently, they do not read Raagmala when concluding a Sehaj Paath or Akhand Paath. This does not violate Maryada. Till this date, Raagmala is not read at Sri Akaal Takht Sahib, Amritsar.

The film was directed by Stanley Donen; it was his second film and the first he directed on his own. It was released as Wedding Bells in the United Kingdom. The story is set in London in 1947 at the time of the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Philip Mountbatten. Astaire and Powell play siblings in a song and dance duo, echoing the real-life theatrical relationship of Fred and Adele Astaire. Royal Wedding is one of several MGM musicals that entered the public domain because the studio failed to renew the copyright registration in the 28th year after its publication. Plot The story sees brother and sister Tom and Ellen Bowen as stars of a show Every Night at Seven, a Broadway success. They are persuaded to take the show to London, capitalizing on the imminent royal wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Philip Mountbatten. Peter Lawford, Jane Powell and Fred Astaire in Royal Wedding On the ship, Ellen meets and quickly falls in love with the impoverished but well-connected Lord John Brindale. Whilst casting the show in London, Tom falls in love with a newly engaged dancer, Anne Ashmond. Tom assists Anne to reconcile her estranged parents and also asks his agent to locate Anne's supposed fianc√© in Chicago ‚Äì only to discover that he's married and therefore Anne is free to do what she likes. Carried away by the emotion of the wedding, the two couples decide that they will also be married that day. Thanks to the resourcefulness of Tom's London agent, Edgar Klinger, who knows someone in the Archbishop's office who can cut through the official red tape and also has a cooperative minister in his pocket Anne and Tom, and Ellen and John, are in fact married on the royal wedding day. Cast * Fred Astaire as Tom Bowen * Jane Powell as Ellen Bowen * Peter Lawford as Lord John Brindale * Sarah Churchill as Anne Ashmond * Keenan Wynn as Irving Klinger / Edgar Klinger * Albert Sharpe as James Ashmond * Viola Roche as Sarah Ashmond (uncredited) * John R. Reilly as Pete Cumberly (uncredited) Production Stanley Donen and Jane Powell were not part of the film's original crew and cast; former dancer Charles Walters was the film's original director, with June Allyson as Astaire's co-star. Judy Garland was then signed as Ellen due to Allyson's pregnancy, over the objection of Walters who had spent a year- and-a-half nurturing her through her previous film, Summer Stock. Instead of listening to Walters' objection, Arthur Freed brought in Donen as director; Garland, who during rehearsal worked only half-days, started calling in sick as principal photography was to begin. That prompted Freed to replace her with Jane Powell, which in turn caused MGM to cancel Garland's contract with the studio, one that had lasted 14 years. Principal photography took place in 1950, from July 6-August 24; retakes took place in mid-October. The scene featuring the song \\"You're All the World to Me\\" was filmed by building a set inside a revolving barrel and mounting the camera and its operator to an ironing board which could be rotated along with the room. Astaire danced in the barrel set as if he really danced on the wall and ceiling. It inspired the Lionel Richie song Dancing on the Ceiling with the music video featuring Richie doing the same room dance as a tribute to Astaire. Notable songs and dance routines Astaire in \\"Sunday Jumps\\" Astaire in \\"You're All the World to Me\\" The songs in Royal Wedding were written by Burton Lane (music) and Alan Jay Lerner (lyrics). The dances were choreographed by Nick Castle. * \\"Ev'ry Night At Seven\\": The film's opening number has Astaire and Powell perform from the \\"play within a play\\" Broadway musical that their characters are taking to London. * \\"Sunday Jumps\\": Astaire parodies himself by dancing with a hatrack. The fame of the dance rests on Astaire's ability to animate the inanimate. The solo takes place in a ship's gym, where Astaire is waiting to rehearse with his partner Powell, who doesn't turn up, echoing Adele Astaire's attitude toward her brother's obsessive rehearsal habits to which the lyrics (unused and unpublished) also made reference. In 1997, Astaire's widow Robyn authorized Dirt Devil to use a digitally altered version of the scene where Astaire dances with their product in a commercial; Astaire's daughter Ava objected publicly to the commercial, implying they had \\"tarnish[ed] his image\\" and saying it was \\"the antithesis of everything my lovely, gentle father represented\\" * \\"Open Your Eyes\\": This waltz is sung by Powell at the beginning of a romantic routine danced by Powell and Astaire in front of an audience in the ballroom of a transatlantic liner. Soon, a storm rocks the ship and the duet is transformed into a comic routine with the dancers sliding about to the ship's motions. This number is based on a real-life incident which happened to Fred and Adele Astaire as they traveled by ship to London in 1923. * \\"The Happiest Days of My Life\\": Powell's character sings this ballad to Lawford's, with Astaire sitting at the piano. * \\"How Could You Believe Me When I Said I Love You When You Know I've Been a Liar All My Life\\" has what is considered the longest title of any song in MGM musical history. For the first time in his career, Astaire casts aside all pretension to elegance and indulges in a comic song and dance vaudeville-style with Powell. The routine recalls the \\"A Couple Of Swells\\" number with Judy Garland in Easter Parade. Here, for the second time in the film, he seems to parody Gene Kelly by wearing the latter's trademark straw boater and employing the stomps and splayed strides that originated with George M. Cohan and were much favored in Kelly's choreography. * \\"Too Late Now\\": Powell sings her third ballad, this time an open declaration of love, to Lawford. * \\"You're All the World to Me\\": In one of his best-known solos, Astaire dances on the walls and ceilings of his room because he has fallen in love with a beautiful woman who also loves to dance. The idea occurred to Astaire back in the 1920s and was first mentioned by him in the MGM publicity publication Lion's Roar in 1945. * \\"I Left My Hat in Haiti\\": This number, essentially the work of dance director Nick Castle, involves Powell, Astaire, and chorus in a song and dance routine with a Caribbean theme. Reception According to MGM's records, the film earned $2,548,000 in the US and Canada and $1,354,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit to the studio of $584,000. The film was listed by Variety as one of the top box office hits of 1951. Upon its release, Bosley Crowther in The New York Times wrote that the film had \\"a lively lot of dancing and some pleasantly handled songs\\"; according to Crowther, \\"Mr. Astaire has fared better in his lifetime - and he has also fared much worse.\\" On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Royal Wedding had a 91% approval rating based on 23 reviews. The site's consensus reads: \\"Vintage MGM musical stuff, characterized by Stanley Donen's fleet direction and some amazing dance performances from star Fred Astaire.\\" Awards and honors \\"Too Late Now\\" was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 24th Academy Awards, losing the award to \\"In the Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening\\" by Hoagy Carmichael and Johnny Mercer, which featured in Here Comes the Groom. The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2002: AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions ‚Äì Nominated * 2006: AFI's Greatest Movie Musicals ‚Äì Nominated Home video In 2007, Warner Home Video released Royal Wedding in a DVD set as part of its \\"Classic Musicals From The Dream Factory\\" series, along with \\"three fine-but- unexceptional films directed by Norman Taurog\\" and two other films: The Belle of New York and The Pirate. The film was later featured in an episode of Cinema Insomnia. It is also distributed through Corinth Films. The songs listed above were published by MGM on an early 10 inch long play record recorded at 33‚Öì rpm (MGM E-543). The song \\"Sunday Jumps\\" was referenced by Mel Gibson in What Women Want and by David Byrne in the Talking Heads concert film Stop Making Sense. \\"Sunday Jumps\\" was also parodied by Kermit the Frog in The Great Muppet Caper.

Kalmbach Al C. Kalmbach (June 25, 1910‚ÄìOctober 14, 1981) was the founder of Kalmbach Publishing, a publisher of magazines and books geared towards enthusiasts of several different hobbies. Albert Carpenter Kalmbach was born in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin. He grew up in Milwaukee, not far from the shops of the Milwaukee Road. He was ambitious from an early age. At 12 he spent some of his savings to buy a small hand-operated printing press. He would publish the Milwaukee Sun, a neighbourhood paper, until he enrolled in Marquette University. In 1932, after graduation, he had a job offer working on the Pennsylvania Railroad's electrification project, but the job fell through due to the Great Depression. He started a new printing company, The Milwaukee Commercial Press, which specialized in church newspapers, besides commercial job printing. His interest in railroads began during his early life in Sturgeon Bay. The rail line that served his relative's business (Fidler- Skilling Fuel & Dock) was the Ahnapee and Western Railway. His interest in model railroads came from helping his friend Frank P. Zeidler (later mayor of Milwaukee) with electrical problems on the O Scale layout Zeidler was building. Al was hooked and began construction in 1928 of his own layout, the Great Gulch, Yahoo Valley & Northern, in his parents' attic. In the winter of 1932-33 he helped to organize the Model Railroad Club of Milwaukee. Kalmbach, seeing the interest people had in the operating O Scale layouts at the 1933 Chicago Century of Progress Exposition, turned to one of his lifelong loves ‚Äî railroads ‚Äî for the topic of his first magazine. The Model Railroader began publication in the summer of 1933, the first issue dated January 1934. A press release announcing the magazine appeared in August 1933, but did not receive much interest. The bank refused to loan Kalmbach any money, many felt sorry for him, and a few told him he was crazy. His first wife, Bernice, herself a journalist, encouraged and helped Al put The Model Railroader together. They figured it would be a sideline business from their commercial printing operations. Soon they were devoted seven days a week to the venture. The magazine was well-received by model railroaders, and the young publisher carried the entire press run (272 copies) by streetcar to be mailed. By July paid circulation exceeded a thousand copies. Growth continued, but the magazine was not a big success. Model Railroader (Kalmbach eventually dropped its definite article) became profitable after three years. It took Kalmbach seven years to pay off the loans used to launch the magazine. Al Kalmbach did much to popularize the hobby. His main interest was operation. He enjoyed being the dispatcher at the Model Railroad Club of Milwaukee, and published many articles on operation. He also wrote a book, How to Run a Model Railroad, under the name Boomer Pete. Kalmbach was a driving force in bringing model railroaders from across the US and Canada to Milwaukee for the founding convention of the National Model Railroad Association in September 1935. Model Railroader (MR) would serve as the official publication of the NMRA in the early years. For his efforts he was awarded Honorary Life Member No. 1, and received the NMRA's 30th anniversary award. In 1940, business was good enough for Kalmbach to launch another magazine about railroads in general with the simple title of Trains Magazine. From its first issue dated November 1940, it grew quickly from an initial circulation of just over 5,000. Trains reflected Kalmbach's interest in prototype railroading. Both magazines remain the flagships of the company, which has since expanded to include a portfolio of more than a dozen magazines, hundreds of books, and many videos. The Second World War introduced paper rationing, which impacted the growth of the Kalmbach Publishing Company. At the end of the war, MR circulation was about 20,000. By 1950, MR circulation had grown to more than 100,000, thanks in part to a boom in interest in model railroading. Kalmbach was a tireless promoter of the hobby of model railroading. In 1949 Kalmbach Publishing launched a national ad campaign promoting the hobby to the general public. Ads were placed in major publications, with a circulation of 42 million. During 1952-53, Kalmbach was president of the Hobby Industry Association of America. Kalmbach was an early booster and benefactor of the National Model Railroad Association. His legacy today is the Al C. Kalmbach Memorial Library, located in the NMRA headquarters in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Kalmbach died in 1981 of Parkinson's disease.

It is also called \\"cellular vampirism\\" as the predatory cell pierces the cell wall and/or cell membrane of the prey cell with a feeding tube, the conoid, sucks out the cellular content and digests it. Myzocytosis is found in Myzozoa and also in some species of Ciliophora (both comprise the alveolates). A classic example of myzocytosis is the feeding method of the infamous predatory ciliate, Didinium, where it is often depicted devouring a hapless Paramecium. The suctorian ciliates were originally thought to have fed exclusively through myzocytosis, sucking out the cytoplasm of prey via superficially drinking straw-like pseudopodia. It is now understood that suctorians do not feed through myzocytosis, but actually, instead, manipulate and envenomate captured prey with their tentacle-like pseudopodia.

The left- handed virtuoso banjo player was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, the son of well-regarded string bass player Henry Kimball. He was playing music professionally by the mid-1920s with such groups as the bands of Fate Marable and Papa Celestin. He married a fellow member of Celestin's Tuxedo Jazz Band, pianist Jeanette Kimball (n√©e Salvant). In the 1930s during the Great Depression Kimball switched to string bass to play in swing bands such as Sidney Desvigne's, but music did not provide enough money; he got a day job as a mailman. He continued playing music in the evening, leading his band called \\"Narvin Kimball's Gentlemen of Jazz\\". After World War II he formed a singing group called \\"The Four Tones\\" with Fred Minor, Alvin Alcorn, and Louis Barbarin that enjoyed some local success. Around 1960 with the revival of interest in traditional jazz, Kimball was able to return to playing the banjo professionally again. He played regularly at such French Quarter venues as Preservation Hall and Dixieland Hall, at the latter often leading a band under his own name. However, he kept his day job as a postman until his retirement in 1973; until then he only took brief tours outside the city while on vacation from his postal job. After this date, he toured the United States and Europe extensively with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band. His singing \\"Georgia on My Mind\\" was a reliable show stopper. He was the oldest member of the band at his retirement in 1999 at age 90. When Hurricane Katrina was threatening New Orleans, in 2005, Preservation Hall leader Ben Jaffe made a point to make sure Kimball and his wife were evacuated to Baton Rouge. He died in exile with relatives in South Carolina.

Since he had not gone through the al-Azhar High School curriculum, he took it upon himself in his first year at the college to study and memorize all of the basic texts, which many of the other students had already covered. =Teaching= Gomaa taught in the faculty of Islamic and Arabic Studies at al-Azhar University from the time he received his M.A. until he was appointed Grand Mufti, first as an assistant professor and then as a full professor.Islamica Magazine, Issue # 12, Spring 2005 In addition to being a teacher of Aqida, Tafsir, Hadith, legal theory and Islamic history, Gomaa is also a highly respected Sufi master.Egypt Independent: \\"Opposing currents: Internal rifts may risk the credibility of Egypt‚Äôs religious institutions\\" by Mai Shams El-Din 25 February 2013Carnegie Endowment: \\"Salafis and Sufis in Egypt\\" by Jonathan Brown December 2011  p 12  \\"...the current Grand Mufti of Egypt and senior al-Azhar scholar Ali Gomaa is also a highly respected Sufi master.Ali Gomaa website: Fatwa on Sufism retrieved 29 June 2013 In addition to the courses he taught at the University, Gomaa also revived the tradition of open classes held in a mosque where he taught a circle of students six days a week from after sunrise until noon. Gomaa established these lessons in 1998 al-Ahram 1 October 2005 with the aim of protecting the Islamic intellectual tradition from being lost or misinterpreted: \\"I want people to continue in the tradition of knowledge reading the classical texts the way they were written, not the way people want to understand them.\\" Islamica Magazine, Issue #12, Spring 2005 In addition to the lessons in al-Azhar, Gomaa also began giving the Friday sermon (khutbah) in Cairo's Sultan Hassan Mosque in 1998 after which he would give a short lesson in Islamic jurisprudence for the general public followed by a question-and-answer session. In addition Gomaa speaks fluent English, and he was a former chairman of Al-Azhar University's Islamic Jurisprudence Department. =Work with Jihadi Prisoners= Gomaa has told American journalist Lawrence Wright that he worked with Islamic Group prisoners who later embraced the \\"Nonviolence Initiative\\" and denounced violence. \\"I began going into the prisons in the 1990s.... We had debates and dialogues with the prisoners, which continued for more than three years. Such debates became the nucleus for the revisionist thinking.\\" =Grand Mufti= Ali Gomaa was appointed Grand Mufti in late September 2003. by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, replacing former Mufti Mohamed Ahmed El-Tayeb. El- Tayeb was appointed Al-Azhar University president, taking over from Ahmed Omar Hashem. His office, the Dar al Ifta (literally, the House of Fatwas), a government agency charged with issuing religious legal opinions on any question to Muslims who ask for them, issued some 5,000 fatwas a week, including both official ones, which he would personally work on, about important issues and more routine ones handled via phone and Internet by a dozen or so subordinate muftis. Conclusion of term Despite having a one-year extension of his term because of the political situation in post- revolutionary Egypt, Gomaa's term was allowed to expire. A committee decided Shawki Ibrahim Abdel-Karim Allam to be the Mufti's successor.  Views On selling pork and alcohol in the West and 'non-Muslim countries'= In a fatwa issued by Dar-al-ifta,(fatwa number 4189) approved and signed by Ali Gomaa, the Egyptian Mufti stated that selling pork and alcohol is permitted in the West because \\"it is allowed taking the opinion of the scholars from the Hanafi madhhab, who allow to deal with wrong contracts in non-Muslim countries.\\" Another justification was that the Prophet let his uncle Al-‚ÄòAbbas ibn ‚ÄòAbd al-Muttalib take usury in Mecca when it was a non-Muslim city, and he did not prohibit him except in the year of the Farewell Pilgrimage. During the fatwa, which was a reply to a question from a Muslim in Europe asking about whether it would be allowed for him to work in stores that sell alcohol and pork along with other products because he cannot find another job, Gomaa mentioned the terms \\"Dar-al-Harb\\" (House of War) and \\"Ahl al-Harb\\" (people of war) several times, and he gave a response that not only dealt with what the questioner had asked but also considered further points such as the taking of interest and gambling. =On female circumcision= Since taking office, Gomaa issued a number of fatwas and statements that have made an impact in the media. He has issued a fatwa asserting that men and women enjoy equal political rights in Islam, including the right to become president of a modern state.Mufti not against women presidents after all? at The Arabist He recently stated on national television that it is permissible in Islam for a woman to have hymen restoration surgery for any reason since Islam promotes protecting one's privacy and reputation and does not require a woman to provide proof of her virginity.Broadsheet: Women's Articles, Women's Stories, Women's Blog ‚Äì Salon.com In November 2006, he ruled that female circumcision (also referred to as female genital mutilation or FGM) should not be applied; this ruling is in accordance with Egyptian law, which also forbids female circumcision. This ruling came about after a conference instigated by research and a documentary on FGM in Somalia by the German action group Target. The fatwa is now also used in Western Europe to combat FGM. On 24 June 2007, after an 11-year-old died under the knife undergoing circumcision, he decreed that female circumcision was not just \\"un-Islamic\\" but forbidden. = Views on women = According to Dr James Dorsey of Nanyang Technological University, \\"Gomaa asserted in 2015 that women did not have the strength to become heart surgeons, serve in the military, or engage in sports likes soccer, body building, wrestling and weightlifting. A year later, Gomaa issued a fatwa declaring writer Sherif El-Shobashy an infidel for urging others to respect a woman‚Äôs choice on whether or not to wear the veil.\\" = Other views = Before the Arab revolutions, Gomaa stated that Islam does not call for and has never known a theocratic state and that there is no contradiction between Islam and liberal democracy: \\"I consider myself a liberal and a Muslim, but this does not mean I am a secularist. The Egyptian [historical] experience has combined liberalism and Islam in the best of ways.\\"Nahdah Masr, 3 February 2007 After the Arab revolutions, he has been a staunch advocate for authoritarianism. He is a signatory of the Amman Message, which gives a broad foundation for defining Muslim orthodoxy, unequivocally states that nobody has the right to excommunicate a Muslim, and it restricts the issuing of fatwas to those with the scholarly qualifications to do so. In 2007, he \\"unequivocally told The Washington Post that the death penalty for apostasy simply no longer applies.\\" Ramadan al-Sherbini of Gulf News later reported Gomaa clarifying that Muslims are not free to change their faith: \\"What I actually said is that Islam prohibits a Muslim from changing his religion and that apostasy is a crime, which must be punished.\\" However, the Mufti still rejects the death penalty for apostasy. In 2009, posted on his website that he does not believe that apostasy is punishable by death. In fact, it was only two years ago that Sheikh Ali Gomaa made clear statements to the effect that apostasy is not punishable by death in Islam, a position that he holds to this day. Gomaa has publicly asserted that the anti-Semitic The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is a forgery and made an official court complaint concerning a publisher who falsely put his name on an introduction to its Arabic translation.al-Ahram, 1 January 2007 =Views on extremism= Gomaa has taken a very clear stance against extremist interpretations of Islam. \\"He has become the most explicitly anti-extremist cleric in mainstream Sunni Islam.\\" The Atlantic Monthly, July/August 2005 He says that the use of violence to spread Islam is prohibited and extremists have not been educated in genuine centers of Islamic learning: \\"Terrorists are criminals, not Muslim activists.\\" Down For Maintenance He indicates, about religion in general including Islam: \\"Terrorism cannot be born of religion. Terrorism is the product of corrupt minds, hardened hearts, and arrogant egos, and corruption, destruction, and arrogance are unknown to the heart attached to the divine.\\" Gomaa believes the best antidote to Islamic extremism is \\"traditional conception of sharia law ‚Äî along with knowledge of Islamic jurisprudence\\" =Views on ISIL= Gomaa is highly critical of the rebel group ISIL In September 2014, he, alongside 226 other prominent Sunni scholars, was a signatory to an open letter denouncing ISIL and its religious tenets. In February 2015, he was noted for statements regarding the burning to death of Jordanian pilot Muath al-Kasasbeh by ISIL in which he claimed to have proof that the burning was photoshopped and that the pilot was not in fact burned to death. He stated as proof of his claim that in the video published by ISIS, Al-Kasabeh stands still while being burned, something that would seem impossible. = On Sculptures = On 18 April 2006, an article entitled \\"Egypt's grand mufti issues fatwa: no sculpture\\" appeared stating: \\"Artists and intellectuals here say the edict, whose ban on producing and displaying sculptures overturns a century-old fatwa, runs counter to Islam. They also worry that extremists may use the ruling as a pretense for destroying Egypt's ancient relics, which form a pillar of the country's multibillion-dollar tourist industry.\\" Jay Tolson defended Gomaa, saying that \\"while Gomaa did say that it was un-Islamic for Muslims to own statues or to display them in their homes, he made it very clear that the destruction of antiquities and other statues in the public sphere was unacceptable and indeed criminal. He is also on record deploring the Taliban's destruction of the great Buddhist statuary in Afghanistan.\\" Egyptian Revolution Dr. Ali Gomaa made several public statements in relation to the massive uprising that began on 25 January 2011 and led to the stepping down of former Egyptian President Mubarak on 11 February 2011. His general position was one of caution addressing the potential for mass bloodshed and chaos. He was clear that public protest to address grievances is a fundamental human right, but cautioned that mass demonstrations leading to a disruption of day-to-day life could be considered impermissible (haram) from an Islamic legal point of view. On 3 February 2011, Gomaa went on national TV to answer \\"hundreds of calls he received that day\\" with concerns about attending Friday prayer services. He issued a fatwa allowing people who feared physical harm from further mass protests to pray at home and not attend Friday prayer services. =Under Morsi= In March 2011, Gomaa's 60th birthday and the official retirement age of Egyptian government employees, the SCAF issued him a one-year extension to help with the continuity of government. In June of the following year Muhammad Morsi was elected Egypt's new president. On 20 July 2012, Gomaa held a national press conference to announce the start of the holy month of Ramadan and announced the month in the name of Egypt's new president. In March 2013, Gomaa retired from his position of Grand Mufti of Egypt, and Dr. Shawqi Allam became Egypt's new Grand Mufti. Views on future of Islam in Egypt In an op-ed in The New York Times, he supported the passage of the 2011 Constitutional referendum, calling it a \\"milestone\\" for Egyptian democracy. He also stated that since Egypt is a very religious society, \\"it is inevitable that Islam will have a place in our democratic political order\\". However, he reassured that Muslims believe that \\"Islamic law guarantees freedom of conscience and expression (within the bounds of common decency) and equal rights for women.\\" He also stated that there was no contradiction between Articles 2 and 7 of the constitution, the former saying that Islam was the official religion of the state and that legislation was based on principles of Islamic jurisprudence, the latter guaranteeing full citizenship before the law to members of Egyptian society regardless of religion, race or creed. He also stated that Islamists would stay within mainstream, and that radicalism would \\"not only run contrary to the law, but will also guarantee their political marginalization\\". An opponent believes that Gomaa is not necessarily committed to democracy. Following the Egyptian coup, he expressed hostility towards Western democracy in a television interview and stated that it was contrary to Islamic law. Specifically, he argued that the Muslim Brothers should be following Islamic law, not Western democracy. 2013 Egyptian Coup Following the 2013 Egyptian coup d'√©tat, Gomaa expressed his support for the coup encouraging soldiers to kill those protesting the coup and cancelled a visit to London out of fear of prosecution for this. According to Dr David H. Warren of University of Edinburgh, Ali Gomaa was one of \\"the most prominent supporters of the coup and its bloody aftermath.\\" Warren notes that Gomaa referred to anti-coup protestors as the \\"dogs of hell\\" and seemed to justify the army's mass killing of these protestors. Dr Usaama al-Azami of the University of Oxford also notes that Gomaa told the army shortly before the Rabaa massacre that they \\"should not hesitate to kill those who oppose them.\\" After the massacre, al-Azami adds, Gomaa justified the army's actions. = Urging military to shoot protestors = Professor Mohammad Fadel of the University of Toronto Faculty of Law argues that Gomaa representative of \\"authoritarian forms of political Islam.\\" According to Fadel, Gomaa \\"incited the Egyptian military, in a sermon given to the armed forces in the presence of its senior leadership, to kill supporters of the deposed president, urging them to \\"shoot to kill\\" (i·∏çrab fƒ´‚Äôl-malyƒÅn).\\" Fadel adds: \\" øAlƒ´ Jumu øa exhorts the armed forces to cleanse Egypt of the former president‚Äôs supporters, even claiming that the army‚Äôs position was vindicated by, among other things, the \\"innumerable visions (tawƒÅtarat al-ru æƒÅ) of the Prophet of God\\" that came to Egypt's living saints in which he communicated to them his support for the military against the former president.\\" In the lead up to the coup, Gomaa made several statements, both public and private, in support of the coup. This included a video message to the security forces in which he tells soldiers who are supporting the coup \\"When somebody comes who tries to divide you, then kill them, whoever they are.\\" During this period, he described protesters against the coup as the \\"dogs of hell.\\" Original writings The author of \\"over 50 books, as well as hundreds of articles\\",Profile on The Muslim 500 his published works include: * ‚ÄòAlaqah Usul al-Fiqh bil al-Falsafah * Aliyat al- Ijtihad * Athr Dhihab al-Mahal flllli al-Hukm * al-Bayan * al-Hukm al-Shar‚Äôi * al-Ijma‚Äô ‚Äòind al-Us≈´liyyƒ´n * al-ImƒÅm al-ShƒÅfi‚Äôi wa Madrasatuhu al-Fiqhiyyah * al-ImƒÅm al-BukhƒÅri * al-IslƒÅm wa al-MusƒÅwƒÅh baina al-WƒÅqi' wa al-Ma'm≈´l * al- Kalim al-Tayyib vol. 2 * MabƒÅhith al-Amr ‚Äòind al-Us≈´liyyin * al-Madkhal ila DirƒÅsah al-MadhƒÅhib al-Fiqhiyyah * al-Mustalah al-Us≈´li wa al-Tatbiq ‚Äòala Ta'rif al-Qiyas * al-NadhariyyƒÅt al-Usuliyyah wa Madkhal li DirƒÅsah ‚ÄòIlm al- Us≈´l * Qadiyyah Tajdƒ´d Us≈´l al-Fiqh * al-Qiyas ‚Äòind al-Us≈´liyyƒ´n * al-Ru‚Äôyah wa Hujjiyyatuha al-Us≈´liyyah * Taqyƒ´d al-MubƒÅh    * Teachers His sheikhs and teachers include in alphabetical order: # ‚ÄòAbd al-Hafidh al-Tijani # ‚ÄòAbd al-Hakim ‚ÄòAbd al-Latif # ‚ÄòAbd al-Hamid Mayhub # Ahmad Jabir al-Yamani # ‚ÄòAbd al-Jalil al-Qaranshawi # Ahmad Hammadah al- Shafi‚Äôi # Ahmad Mursi # ‚ÄòAli Ahmad Mar‚Äôi # Hasan Ahmad Mar‚Äôi # al-Husayni Yusuf al-Shaykh # Ibrahim Abu al-Khashab # ‚ÄòIwad Allah al-Hijazi # ‚ÄòIwad al- Zabidi # Ismail Sadiq al-‚ÄôAdwi # Ismail al-Zayn al-Yamani # Jad al-Haqq ‚ÄòAli Jad al-Haqq # Jad al-Rabb Ramadan # Muhammad Abu Nur Zuhayr # Muhammad Alawi al-Maliki # Muhammad Ismail al-Hamadani # Muhammad Mahmud Farghali # Muhammad Shams al-Din al-Mantiqi # Muhammad Zaki Ibrahim # Sha‚Äôban Muhammad Ismail # Said ‚ÄòAbd Allah al-Lajhi # al-Sayiid Salih ‚ÄòIwad # Salih al-Ja‚Äôfari # Yasin al-FƒÅdƒÅni Further reading * Do We Need A Common Word? * Newsweek: ‚ÄòA Small Miracle‚Äô * The Wise Mufti * Articles of faith * Thesaurus Islamicus Foundation * Encyclopaedia of Hadith and IHSAN Network * The Show-Me Sheikh: \\"The grand mufti of Egypt, Ali Gomaa, is peddling a new kind of radical Islam‚Äî traditionalism without the extremism\\" by G.

His tribal home is the town of Bahla. As a child he studied at Qur'anic schools on the island of Zanzibar from which he graduated at the age of 9 years old, having memorised the Quran. He then followed the teachings of several prominent clerics, including Sheikh Issa bin Saeed Al Ismaili, Sheikh Hamoud bin Saeed Al Kharusi and Sheikh Ahmed bin Zahran Al Riyami. He also attended the workshops of Abu Ishaq Ibrahim Tfayyesh when he visited Zanzibar. Sheikh Ahmed did not go to a secular school, but devoted himself to reading and learning. Along with his studies, he assisted his father in the field of trade in Zanzibar until the 1964 Zanzibar Revolution ended monarchical rule in Zanzibar. Sheikh Ahmed, with his father and many of those with Omani heritage, emigrated to Oman. The Sheikh returned with his father to the wilayat of Bahla in Oman. He was asked to teach at the Bahla Mosque, and did so for ten months. He was then appointed as a teacher at the al Khor Mosque in Muscat until 1971. In 1971 he was appointed a judge at the Court of Appeal; he continued his studies at the same time. He was then appointed Director of the Ministry of Justice, Islamic Affairs and Awqaf and Islamic Affairs, and in 1395 (1975 CE), a royal decree appointed him the Grand Mufti of the Sultanate of Oman, the highest Islamic authority in Oman, after the death of the scholar Sheikh Ibrahim bin Said Al Abri.

Managed by the U.S. Forest Service in the U.S. Department of Agriculture, it was designated the Sawtooth Primitive Area in 1937 to preserve the exceptional scenic beauty of the Sawtooth Mountains. On August 22, 1972 Public Law 92-400 designated the Primitive Area as the Sawtooth Wilderness and part of the newly created Sawtooth National Recreation Area. As part of the National Wilderness Preservation System, the Sawtooth Wilderness is an area where human development and use are restricted and people are to remain only visitors. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the Sawtooth Wilderness has some of the clearest air in the lower 48 states. History Sawtooth National Forest was created as the Sawtooth Forest Reserve in the U.S. Department of Agriculture by proclamation of President Theodore Roosevelt on May 29, 1905. It was named after the Sawtooth Mountains in the northwestern part of the forest. On October 12, 1937, the U.S. Forest Service established the Sawtooth Primitive Area in the Sawtooth Mountains. Subsequently, Sawtooth National Forest began to extensively develop recreation opportunities, including new campgrounds, trails, and roads. In 1960, Frank Church, a U.S. Senator from Idaho, first introduced legislation for a feasibility study to study the area for national park status. While Church allowed the 1960 feasibility study legislation to die, he introduced a bill in 1963 to create Sawtooth Wilderness National Park, which would primarily encompass the existing Sawtooth Primitive Area. While the 1963 bill also died, Church admitted that it wasn't designed to pass but rather to encourage thorough feasibility studies by both the Forest Service and National Park Service. Support for greater protection of the Sawtooths and surrounding areas grew after the discovery of a molybdenum deposit at the base of Castle Peak in the White Cloud Mountains in 1968. In March 1971 Idaho's congressional delegation was finally united and introduced legislation to create the SNRA. On August 22, 1972 Public Law 92-400 establishing the SNRA, covering , and banning mining in it passed both the House of Representatives and Senate and was signed into law by President Richard Nixon. As part of this legislation, the Sawtooth Primitive Area became the Sawtooth Wilderness covering and part of the National Wilderness Preservation System under the Wilderness Act of 1964. The SNRA was dedicated in a ceremony held on the shores of Redfish Lake on September 1, 1972. Management South Fork of the Payette River Valley and Rendezvous Lake The Sawtooth Wilderness is managed by Sawtooth National Recreation Area, which is a division of Sawtooth National Forest. However, the wilderness encompasses land that was originally part of three National Forests: in Boise National Forest, in Challis National Forest, and in Sawtooth National Forest. The Wilderness Act of 1964 enhanced the protection status of remote or undeveloped land already contained within federally administered protected areas. Passage of the act ensured that no human improvements would take place aside from those already existing. The protected status in wilderness-designated zones prohibits road and building construction, oil and mineral exploration or extraction, and logging, and also prohibits the use of motorized equipment, including bicycles. The only manner in which people can enter wilderness areas is either on foot or horseback. Hunting and fishing are permitted in the wilderness, just as they are throughout the SNRA, provided those engaging in such activities have the proper licenses and permits. Fires and stock are prohibited in certain high- use areas of the wilderness. Recreation Sawtooth Mountains from the Alpine Way Trail Wilderness areas do not allow motorized or mechanical equipment, including bicycles. Although camping and fishing are allowed with proper permit, no roads or buildings are constructed, and there is also no logging or mining. Hunting is permitted during the appropriate hunting seasons. Hunting and fishing licenses are available from the state of Idaho through the Idaho Department of Fish and Game. There are 40 trails totaling nearly in the wilderness that can be used for day hiking, backpacking, and horseback riding and accessed from 23 trailheads. Most of these trails were constructed or reconstructed in the 1960s. Mountain climbing, rock climbing, snowshoeing, and backcountry downhill skiing are activities that are also permitted in the wilderness. The closest town to the wilderness is Stanley at the northern end of the Sawtooth Valley, but the communities of Atlanta and Sawtooth City also provide access to the wilderness. Geography and geologyMountains= The Sawtooth Wilderness encompasses the Sawtooth Mountains, which are part of the Rocky Mountains. The Sawtooth Mountains have at least 50 peaks over high, including Thompson Peak, the highest point in the range and the wilderness at . The second highest point in Mount Cramer. The northern Sawtooth Mountains formed from the Eocene Sawtooth batholith, while south of Alturas Lake the Sawtooth Mountains formed from the Cretaceous granodiorite of the Idaho Batholith. =Waterways= Sawtooth Lake and Mount Regan in June 2008 The entire wilderness is in the watershed of the Snake River, a tributary of the Columbia River, which flows into the Pacific Ocean. The eastern side of the wilderness is drained by Salmon River, which flows into the Snake River downstream. The western side of the wilderness is in the watershed of the South Fork of the Payette River, while part of the southern end of the wilderness is drained by the Boise River. Several hundred lakes exist in the Sawtooth Wilderness, and nearly all are the result of glaciation. The largest lake in the wilderness is Sawtooth Lake, and other large lakes include Alice, Toxaway, Ardeth, Edna, Hell Roaring, Goat, and Baron lakes. Lakes in the wilderness can remain frozen until mid-summer, and many of the smaller lakes are unnamed. =Seismology= The Sawtooth Fault is a long east-dipping normal fault that runs along the base of the Sawtooth Mountains and was discovered and mapped in 2010. It is believed to be capable of producing an earthquake measuring up to 7.5 on the Richter magnitude scale, with one of the most recent large earthquakes occurring 4,000 years ago and a second 7,000 years ago. = Glaciology = The Sawtooth Wilderness has a history of alpine glaciation, and while no surface glaciers exist today, perennial snow fields and rock glaciers remain, usually on north or east facing slopes. There have been 202 perennial snow fields mapped in the Sawtooth Mountains. The Sawtooth Mountains were last extensively glaciated in the Pleistocene, but glaciers probably existed during the Little Ice Age, which ended around AD 1850. Remnants of glacial activity include glacial lakes, moraines, horns, hanging valleys, cirques, and ar√™tes. Natural ResourcesFlora= A meadow and spruce-fir forests below Parks Peak Land cover types in the Sawtooth Wilderness include pine and spruce-fir forests, meadows, and alpine tundra. Lodgepole pine forms nearly monotypic forests in lower elevations of the wilderness, while douglas fir and quaking aspen can also be found. Higher elevations contain whitebark pine, Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, and limber pine. There are no known threatened or endangered plant species in the wilderness. =Fauna= Most of the area's native mammal species are present in the wilderness, with the exception of grizzly bears, which have become locally extinct. Gray wolves were reintroduced to the SNRA amidst controversy in the mid-1990s and now occupy most of the forest except for the Minidoka District. They were reintroduced to restore the ecosystem stability that they provide as top predators, including managing high elk populations, which had inhibited new vegetation growth. Opponents to the reintroduction included hunters concerned that wolves would inhibit their ability to hunt the highest number of game species possible, ranchers concerned for the welfare of their animals, and land developers concerned that a species listed under the Endangered Species Act may restrict what they can do to their land. Plans for the reintroduction of grizzly bears to central Idaho have been proposed since the 1990s, but have not progressed because of concerns similar to those with the wolf reintroduction but also concerns for personal safety. The wilderness contains habitat for wolverines and the endangered Canada lynx, but no recent sightings of these species have been reported. Other large mammals found in the wilderness include mule deer, elk, moose, mountain goats, mountain lions, and black bears. Bull trout are the management indicator species for Sawtooth National Forest, and they can be found in some of the streams in the wilderness. Population monitoring efforts are undertaken every year to provide an assessment of forest health. They were selected because they are dependent upon specific habitat conditions and sensitive to habitat changes.

He co-founded Le Nouvel Observateur weekly in 1964. A supporter of Jean-Paul Sartre's existentialist version of Marxism after the Second World War, he became in the aftermath of the May '68 student riots more concerned with political ecology. In the 1960s and 1970s he was a main theorist in the New Left movement and coined the concept of non-reformist reform. His central theme was wage labour issues such as liberation from work, the just distribution of work, social alienation, and a guaranteed basic income.Andr√© Gorz, Pour un revenu inconditionnel suffisant, published in TRANSVERSALES/SCIENCE-CULTURE (n¬∞ 3, 3e trimestre 2002) CareerEarly years= Born in Vienna as Gerhart Hirsch, he was the son of a Jewish wood-salesman and of a Catholic mother, who came from a cultivated background and worked as a secretary. Although his parents did not have any strong sense of national or religious identity, the spreading anti-Semitism of the time led his father to convert to Catholicism in 1930. At the outbreak of World War II (1939), his mother sent him to an institution in Switzerland to avoid his mobilization into the Wehrmacht. Thereafter, Hirsch was a stateless person until 12 April 1957,Willy Gianinazzi, Andr√© Gorz. Une vie, La D√©couverte, 2016, p. 69. when he was naturalized French thanks to Pierre Mend√®s-France's support.Michel Contat, Andr√© Gorz, le philosophe et sa femme, Le Monde des livres, 26 October 2006, mirrored by Multitudes He graduated from the University of Lausanne in chemical engineering in 1945. Working at first as a translator of American short stories published by a Swiss editor, he published his first articles in a cooperative journal. In 1946 he met Jean- Paul Sartre, with whom he became close. He was then mainly influenced by existentialism and phenomenology. Gorz contributed to the journals Les Temps modernes (Paris), New Left Review, Technologie und Politik (Reinbek). In June 1949 Gorz moved to Paris, where he worked first at the international secretariat of the Mouvement des , then as private secretary of a military attach√© of the embassy of India. He then entered Paris-Presse as a journalist, taking the pseudonym of Michel Bosquet. There, he met with Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber, who in 1955 recruited him as an economist journalist for L'Express. Alongside his journalistic activities, Gorz worked closely with Sartre and adopted an existentialist approach to Marxism, leading him to emphasize the questions of alienation and of liberation in the framework of existential experience and an analysis of social systems from the viewpoint of individual experience. This intellectual framework formed the basis of his first books, Le Tra√Ætre (Le Seuil, 1958, prefaced by SartreLe philosophe Andr√© Gorz et sa femme se sont suicid√©s, Le Figaro, 25 September 2007 ), La Morale de l'histoire (Le Seuil, 1959) and the Fondements pour une morale (Galil√©e, 1977, published fifteen years later), which he signed for the first time as Andr√© Gorz, from the German name of the now Italian city (G√∂rz) where the eyeglasses given to his father by the Austrian Army were made. =1960s‚Äì1980s= Gorz also was a main theorist in the New Left movement, inspired by the young Marx, discussions of humanism and alienation and the liberation of humanity. Gorz was also influenced by the Frankfurt School, being a friend of Herbert Marcuse. Other friends of his included Rossana Rossanda, founder of Il Manifesto newspaper, the photographer William Klein, younger intellectuals such as Marc Kravetz or Tiennot Grumbach, and Ronald Fraser of the New Left Review. He strongly criticized structuralism because of its criticisms of the subject and of subjectivity. He called himself a \\"revolutionary-reformist\\", a democratic socialist who wanted to see system- changing reforms. In 1961, he entered the editorial committee of Les Temps Modernes, introducing to French thought the Italian Garavini, the neo- Keynesian and Communist Bruno Trentin, and the anarcho-syndicalist Vittorio Foa.On the relationship between Bruno Trentin and Andr√© Gorz, see W. Gianinazzi, op. cit. Imposing himself as the \\"intellectual leader of the 'Italian' tendency of the New Left\\" (Michel ContatMichel Contat, ¬´ Illustres inconnus et inconnus illustres : Andr√© Gorz ¬ª, in Le D√©bat, n¬∞ 50, p. 243.), he influenced activists of the UNEF students' union and of the CFDT (in particular Jean Auger, Michel Rolant and Fredo Krumnow) as a theorist of workers' self-management, recently embraced by the CFDT. His term \\"non- reformist reform\\" refers to proposed programs of change that base their demands on human needs rather than on the needs of the current economic system. He directly addressed himself to trade-unions in Strat√©gie ouvri√®re et n√©ocapitalisme (Le Seuil, 1964), where he criticized capitalist economic growth and expounded on the various strategies open to trade-unions. The same year, he quit L'Express along with Serge Lafaurie, Jacques-Laurent Bost, K.S. Karol and Jean Daniel to found Le Nouvel Observateur weekly (using the pseudonym of Michel Bosquet). Deeply affected by May '68, Gorz saw in these events a confirmation of his existential-Marxist posture, which joined the students' criticisms towards institutional and state organization (State, School, Family, Firm, etc.). Thereafter, Ivan Illich's thesis on education, medicine or the abolition of wage labour became the focus of his attention. He published one of Illich's speeches in Les Temps Modernes in 1961, before meeting him in 1971 in Le Nouvel Observateur at the occasion of his publication of Deschooling Society (Une Soci√©t√© sans √©cole). He later published a resume of Illich's Tools for Conviviality (1973) under the title Lib√©rer l'avenir (Free Future). His links with Illich strengthened after a trip to California in 1974, where he wrote several articles for Le Nouvel Observateur discussing Illich's thesis.Thierry Paquot, The Non-Conformist, Le Monde diplomatique, January 2003 (French version freely-available, and Portuguese and Esperanto translations available) Gorz's evolution and political and philosophical stances led to some tensions with his colleagues on Les Temps Modernes, for which he had assumed the chief editorial responsibilities in 1969. In April 1970, his article Destroy the University (D√©truire l'Universit√©) provoked the resignation of Jean-Bertrand Pontalis and Bernard Pingaud. Gorz also criticized a Maoist tendency present in the journal since 1971 (and supported by Sartre). Finally, in 1974 Gorz resigned as the editor of Les Temps Modernes, following a disagreement concerning an article about the Italian autonomist group Lotta Continua. At the same time, he found himself forced to the periphery of Le Nouvel Observateur, being replaced by more classically oriented economists, while he followed at the same time a campaign against nuclear industry ‚Äî to which EDF, the state electricity firm, replied by withdrawing advertisements from the weekly. Following the weekly's refusal to let him publish a special issue on the nuclear issue, he published it in the Que Choisir? consumers' magazine. In the same period, Gorz was becoming a leading figure of political ecology, his ideas being spread in particular by the ecologist monthly Le Sauvage, founded by Alain Herv√©, the founder of the French section of the Friends of the Earth. In 1975 he published Ecologie et politique (Galil√©e, 1975), which included the essay Ecologie et libert√©, \\"one of the foundational texts of the ecologic problematic\\" (Fran√ßoise GollainFran√ßoise Gollain, Pens√©e √©cologique et critique du travail dans une perspective gorzienne, Orl√©ans, Ph.D. en economic sciences, 1999, p. 113). He was also influenced by Louis Dumont in considering Marxism and Liberalism to be two versions of economist thought. Gorz then opposed himself both to hedonist individualism and utilitarianism and to materialist and productivist collectivism, defending a humanist version of ecology similar to social ecology which is opposed to deep ecology. Gorz's ecologism, however, remained linked to a critique of capitalism, as he called for an \\"ecological, social and cultural revolution which would abolish the constraints of Capitalism\\".French: ¬´ r√©volution √©cologique, sociale et culturelle qui abolisse les contraintes du capitalisme¬ª, quoted by Fran√ßoise Gollain, op. cit., p. 13 = 1980s‚Äì2000s= A year before the election of the left's candidate, Fran√ßois Mitterrand, to the French presidency in 1981, Gorz published Adieux au prol√©tariat (Galil√©e, 1980 ‚Äì Farewell to the Proletariat) where he criticized the cult of the proletarian class in Marxism, arguing that changes in science and technology now made it impossible for the working-class to be the sole, or even primary, revolutionary agent. Although the book was not well received among the French Left, it did receive attention from younger readers. Soon after Sartre's death in that same year Gorz left the editorial board of Les Temps Modernes. In Les Chemins du paradis (Galil√©e, 1983) Gorz remained critical of the Marxist orthodoxy of the time, using Marx's own analysis in the Grundrisse to argue for the need of the political left to embrace the liberatory potential that the increasing automation of factories and services offered as a central part of the socialist project. In 1983 he had a falling out with the pacifist movements when he refused to oppose the deployment of Pershing II missiles by the United States in West Germany. The same year, he resigned from Le Nouvel Observateur. In the 1990s and 2000s, the journals Multitudes, EcoRev' which will publish the last article in French \\"la fin du capitalisme a d√©j√† commenc√©\\" and Entropia published his articles. Gorz was also critical of the post-structuralism and postmodernism of thinkers such as Antonio Negri. His point of view was rooted in early Marxist humanist thinking. Liberation from wage-slavery and social alienation remained one of his goals, even in his later works. He never became an abstract theorist; his reasoning usually concluded with proposals for how to act to make changes. In M√©tamorphoses du travail (Galil√©e, 1988 ‚Äì Metamorphosis of Labour), Gorz argued that capitalism used personal investments from the worker which were not paid back. As such, he became an advocate of Guaranteed basic income, independent from \\"labour\\". He made such a proposal in his book, Critique of Economic Reason, 1989, and argued: > \\"From the point where it takes only 1,000 hours per year or 20,000 to 30,000 > hours per lifetime to create an amount of wealth equal to or greater than > the amount we create at the present time in 1,600 hours per year or 40,000 > to 50,000 hours in a working life, we must all be able to obtain a real > income equal to or higher than our current salaries in exchange for a > greatly reduced quantity of work. In practice, this means that in the future > we must receive our full monthly income every month even if we work full- > time only one month in every two or six months in a year or even two years > out of four, so as to complete a personal, family or community project, or > experiment with different lifestyles, just as we now receive our full > salaries during paid holidays, training courses, possibly during periods of > sabbatical leave, and so forth...\\". He pointed out that in > \\"contrast to the guaranteed social minimum granted by the state to those > unable to find regular paid work, our regular monthly income will be the > normal remuneration we have earned by performing the normal amount of labour > the economy requires each individual to supply. The fact that the amount of > labour required is so low that work can become intermittent and constitute > an activity amongst a number of others, should not be an obstacle to its > being remunerated by a full monthly income throughout one's life. This > income corresponds to the portion of socially produced wealth to which each > individual is entitled by virtue to their participation in the social > process of production. It is, however, no longer a true salary, since it is > not dependent on the amount of labour supplied (in the month or year) and is > not intended to remunerate individuals as workers\\".  Death  Gorz and his wife, Dorine, committed suicide together in his home in Vosnon (Aube). His wife had been diagnosed with a terminal illness and they had already said that neither wanted to survive the other's death. Their bodies were found on 24 September 2007 by a friend, both having died after a lethal injection. AFP, \\"French philosopher commits suicide with wife,\\" 25 September 2007 on-line His book Lettre √† D. Histoire d'un amour (Galil√©e, 2006) was dedicated to his wife, and was in fact a way for him to tell of the love he had for her.

Thrown together by chance, a group of people search a city for a kidnapped peace activist. Set in Allied- occupied Germany, it was shot on location in post-World War II Frankfurt-am- Main (with exterior and interior shots of the IG Farben Building and its paternoster elevators) and Berlin.Hasan, Mark R. (2010). \\" Berlin Express (1948) (review). KQEK.com. Retrieved December 30, 2019. During the opening credits, a full-screen notice reads, \\"Actual scenes in Frankfurt and Berlin were photographed by authorisation of the United States Army of Occupation, the British Army of Occupation, the Soviet Army of Occupation.\\" Plot Various people board a U.S. Army train, the Main Seiner, to Frankfurt: * Frenchwoman Lucienne Mirabeau (Merle Oberon) * American agricultural expert Robert J. Lindley (Robert Ryan) * Dr. Bernhardt (Paul Lukas), a renowned German activist working for peace and the reunification of his country * Frenchman Henri Perrot (Charles Korvin) * British teacher James Sterling (Robert Coote) * Soviet Lieutenant Maxim Kiroshilov (Roman Toporow), and * German businessman Herr Otto Franzen (Fritz Kortner) Dr. Bernhardt tries to become better acquainted with the other passengers, but they all rebuff his overtures because he is a German until Sterling realises who he is, which immediately changes the atmosphere. When he retires to his compartment, he is killed by a bomb. While the others are questioned at the next stop, Frankfurt, they learn that the dead man was actually one of the doctor's bodyguards. Bernhardt had been posing as another passenger, and Lucienne is his secretary. Bernhardt's enemies are not foiled for long. He is kidnapped from the busy train station in broad daylight after he greets Walther (Reinhold Sch√ºnzel), an old, trusted friend. The U.S. Army quickly institutes a search of the city, but when Lucienne begs her fellow travelers to help look for Bernhardt (as they know what he looks like), they at first all decline. One by one, however, they change their minds. Lucienne suggests they go see Walther, unaware that he has betrayed Bernhardt in return for his missing wife's location. When they get there, they discover only Walther's body. He hanged himself after the kidnappers revealed his wife was dead all along. The group then splits up to cover the city, with Lindley accompanying Lucienne to various illegal nightclubs. At the last one, Lindley notices a woman smoking an unusually long cigarette, just like the ones Bernhardt likes. He picks up a discarded butt and shows Lucienne that it has a \\"B\\" monogram on it. When the woman turns out to be an entertainer, pretending to know the answers of questions posed by the customers, Lindley asks her where Bernhardt is. Her clown assistant impedes Lindley, allowing her to get away. When Lindley and Lucienne question Sergeant Barnes (Michael Harvey), the American soldier who was sitting with the woman beforehand, he reluctantly agrees to lead them to where she lives. It is a trap, however. When they get to an abandoned brewery, Barnes turns out to be working with the kidnappers. Now all three are prisoners. However, an undercover agent had knocked out the clown and taken his place, accompanying the others to the hideout. He is shot when the real clown shows up, but manages to get back to the nightclub and inform the authorities where Bernhardt is being held. American soldiers break in just as Bernhardt and Lucienne are about to be shot, and free the three unharmed. Kessler (Otto Waldis), the ringleader, is killed by Perrot, who turns out to be Bernhardt's would-be assassin. The passengers board the connecting Berliner 2 train for Berlin. Perrot suggests that each of them take a turn guarding Bernhardt in his compartment, with him going first. Afterward, Lindley pieces together various lies Perrot had told and recalls that he knew that the bomb was made from a grenade, but the others dismiss his suspicions. Luckily, he sees Perrot strangling Bernhardt in the reflection from a passing train and saves the doctor's life. Perrot is shot dead as he tries to flee.

Muller also noted that this was the first Hollywood production filmed on location in post-war Berlin, beating out A Foreign Affair. Reception The staff at Variety magazine gave the film a positive review, and wrote, \\"[The m]ost striking feature of this production is its extraordinary background of war-ravaged Germany. With a documentary eye, this film etches a powerfully grim picture of life amidst the shambles. It makes awesome and exciting cinema...Ryan establishes himself as a first-rate actor in this film, demonstrating conclusively that his brilliant performance in Crossfire was no one-shot affair.\\" Variety, however, did criticize the screenplay for \\"its failure to break away from the formula of anti-Nazi films.\\" The New York Times had a similar response, stating the film's photography of the post-war landscape creates a \\"realistic, awesome and impressive vista\\". After lukewarm praise for the film's plot, the reviewer continues, \\"...it is the panoramic and close views of life amid the 'new architecture' of Frankfort and Berlin ‚Äî 'early Twentieth Century modern warfare' architecture ‚Äî which gives the adventure the authentic impact of a documentary.\\" Harold Medford was nominated for the Writers Guild of America Award for the Screen, Best Written American Drama, 1949.

He resided in Bloomington, Indiana, and was one of America's wealthiest men. Biography Cook was born in Mattoon, Illinois, and he grew up and graduated from high school in Canton, Illinois where he was a letterman in football, basketball, and track. He majored in biology at Northwestern University where he joined Beta Theta Pi fraternity and graduated in 1953. He had planned to go on to medical school, but was drafted into the army, where he served his two- year stint as a surgical technician. Bill married Gayle Karch in 1957, and they had a son (now an executive within the Cook Group), Carl, in 1962. In 1963, the Cook family moved to Bloomington, Indiana, where they started the company in their apartment that was eventually to become the Cook Group. For his many contributions to society, Cook was honored with honorary degrees from Northwestern University, Indiana University, Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, Marian College (now Marian University), and Vincennes University. Cook Group Initially making medical devices, including guidewires for catheter angiography, Bill Cook and his wife Gayle started Cook Group in a spare bedroom in their Bloomington, Indiana apartment in 1963. They collaborated with many of the founders of Interventional Radiology, including Dr. Charles Dotter, to grow Cook, Inc. into the world's largest family-owned medical device manufacturer.https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/taxing- jobs-out-of-existence/2012/05/09/gIQA75D2DU_story.html Notable products included the Spectrum antibiotic-impregnated catheter (Rifamphin/Minocycline); the Gianturco-Roubin coronary stent, the first coronary stent approved for use in the USA; the first paclitaxel-coated drug-eluting stent, the Supra-G, tested in Asia; and the V-Flex, tested in Europe. Historic preservation Cook and his wife Gayle took an interest in historic preservation projects as business ventures. The most notable project has been the restoration of the West Baden Springs Hotel in partnership with Indiana Landmarks. This project led Cook to take on the development of the French Lick Resort Casino project in Orange County, Indiana. In June 2007, Indiana Landmarks unveiled an award, to be called the \\"Cook Cup,\\" for outstanding individual contributions to historic preservation in Indiana. Also in 2007 Bill, his wife Gayle and son Carl provided the funds to restore Beck's Mill at Salem, Indiana. In April, 2010, Indiana Landmarks announced a $7-million pledge from the Cooks to restore the former Central Avenue Methodist Church in Indianapolis as a performance venue and new state headquarters for Landmarks now known as the Indiana Landmarks Center. From early 2009 he worked to build up and preserve the downtown area of his hometown, Canton, Illinois, also building a factory and new hotel there, with plans to build a second factory. Star of Indiana and Blast! In 1985, Bill Cook began a drum & bugle corps known as the Star of Indiana. He not only provided the $1 million in seed money necessary to start the corps, but he also often helped drive the coach buses that transported the corps around the U.S and Canada on summer tour. Unlike most drum corps, Star of Indiana was run as a business venture, and, in that respect, served as a model for the corps that remain in active competition today. Star of Indiana made DCI finals in every year of competition, and won the Drum Corps International Division I World Championship in 1991 and placed no lower than third from 1990 onwards.A History of Drum & Bugle Corps, Vol. 2; Steve Vickers, ed.; Drum Corps World; 2003 After the 1993 season, Cook and Star of Indiana left DCI and began touring as Brass Theater before debuting the show Blast! at the London Apollo Theatre in Hammersmith. The show opened in the United States in 2000 and moved to Broadway in 2001. It won the 2001 Tony Award for \\"Best Special Theatrical Event\\" and also won the 2001 Emmy Award for \\"Best Choreography.\\" Primetime Emmy Awards (2001) Indiana University Although a graduate of Northwestern University, Bill Cook developed an attachment to Indiana University (IU), located in his adopted hometown of Bloomington. Cook and his wife, Gayle, were ardent supporters of IU's Jacobs School of Music and the school's renowned music library is named in their honor. In 1996, the Cooks designated a $1 million gift to honor IU Foundation President Bill Armstrong and his wife, Martha Lea; this gift was used to fund the Martha Lea and Bill Armstrong Teacher Educators, which allows a group of Indiana public school teachers to advance their professional development by working with IU faculty and education students. In 2010, IU's Kelley School of Business presented the Cooks with the William L. Haeberle Entrepreneurial Legacy Award, which the school bestows upon \\"...Hoosiers who represent the very best in entrepreneurship.\\" The Cook Group donated $15 million to IU Athletics, which was primarily used for the enhancement of the basketball development center, named \\"Cook Hall\\" at its dedication in 2010. Over the years and for many purposes, the Cooks donated more than $45 million to the university, which Bill Cook also served as a trustee from 1995-98. Wealth Bill Cook was the richest man in the state of Indiana. In 2008, he was worth around $5 billion, according to the Forbes 400. In September 2010, Cook was ranked No. 101 on the Forbes 400 list of the wealthiest Americans. His wealth was estimated at $3.1 billion.

It is 139 cm (55 in) long with a 235 cm (7.8 ft) wingspan, and it weighs 5.5 kg (12 lbs). It is whitish-gray, with a black head, red crown patch, black upper neck and legs, and white patch to the rear of the eye. It has black primaries and secondaries. Both sexes are similar. Some populations are known to make seasonal movements. It is revered in Buddhist traditions and culturally protected across much of its range. A festival in Bhutan celebrates the bird while the Indian union territory of Jammu and Kashmir considers it as the state bird. Description This medium-sized crane is mostly grey with a black head and neck. The lores and crown are naked and dull red. A small patch of white feathers are present below and behind the eye. The tail is black and makes it easy to distinguish at a distance from the similar looking common crane which has grey tail. Distribution and habitat Copy of an illustration in 188x188px From Phobjikha Valley, Bhutan. The black-necked crane summers mainly in the high altitude Tibetan Plateau. The breeding areas are alpine meadows, lakeside and riverine marshes and river valleys. They also make use of barley and wheat fields in these areas. Wintering areas tend to be in sheltered valleys or lower altitudes. The largest populations are in China with smaller numbers extending into Vietnam, Bhutan and India. Small populations have been noted in northern Sikkim. A small group of 20 to 40 was once known to regularly visit the Subansiri area in the Apa Tani valley until 1975 and vagrants have been recorded in Nepal. In 1996 there were about 4,000 of the birds, most of whom spent their winters in Tibet in the valleys of the Nyanga, Lhasa and Pengbo rivers and the middle reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo. The Hutoushan Reservoir in the Pengbo valley is an important winter resting place, with a 96 square kilometres (37 sq mi) Linzhou Black-necked Crane Preservation Zone established in 1993. Black-necked cranes also winter in small numbers in two valleys of western Arunachal Pradesh, India. These are Sangti and Zemithang.Choudhury, A.U. (2000).

The crane valleys of India and Bhutan. Environ 10 (2): 10-15. Behaviour and ecology Black-necked cranes forage on the ground in small groups, often with one bird acting as a sentinel. In winter, the groups arrive and leave the feeding grounds together, but may split into family groups, each group keeping their own small feeding territories in a big marshes or fields. They spend nearly 75% of the day foraging with peak feeding in the early morning and late afternoon. While foraging, they keep walking and they also walk long distances between the feeding spots. In this manner, they cover several kilometers a day while foraging. They feed on the tubers of sedges, plant roots, earthworms, insects and other invertebrates, frogs and other small vertebrates. They may also feed on fallen grains of barley, oats and buckwheat and will sometimes dig up and feed on potatoes, carrots and turnips. Their loud trumpeting calls are similar to those of other cranes.A 1938 photograph of a flock in the Brahmaputra valley These birds are very wary, but in some areas they are accustomed to the local people who do not disturb them. These cranes appear to be able to distinguish people in traditional dress and are especially wary of others. 100 odd of this species come to India every year for breeding. Photograph has been taken at Tso Kar, Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir, India.Like many other crane species, they are believed to form long-lasting pair bonds and dancing displays are made during the breeding season. The breeding birds are territorial and will chase away any intruders of the same species immediately, though they are generally tolerant of other species. The nest site is usually a pre-existing mud island inside a large shallow wetland, sometimes shared along with bar-headed goose. The nest varies from a scantily lined scratch in the ground to a structure made of grass, rushes and weeds with a depression in the centre, sometimes the eggs laid directly on the grass without any structure. Eggs are laid mainly in May and June. One or two eggs. The birds are relatively more wary when the young ones are small. Till the time when the young ones are able to fly, the family kept moving around the nesting location, but later the family started traveling far and wide in the course of a day. Though the young ones are able to forage independently, usually they accompany the parents during foraging. Short, subdued nasal \\"kurrr\\" calls are used by the family to keep in contact and also by adults to indicate availability of food to juveniles. The adults were found to feed the young ones mainly with fish in Ladakh, adults fishing like herons. They are endangered because of the hunters. Status and threats A couple of black- necked Tibetan cranes spotted in 2013 near Yamdrok Lake, alt= The estimated population of the black-necked crane is between 8800 and 11000 individuals. These birds are legally protected in China, India and Bhutan. However habitat modification, drying of lakes and agriculture are threats to the populations. In many areas, dogs belonging to herders are a major threat to young birds. An incident of leopards preying on the roosting cranes during the night has been recorded from the Phobjika valley of Bhutan. In Bhutan Collisions with power lines has been another cause of mortality in some areas. Eggs may also be preyed on by ravens that may use the opportunity provided when humans disturb the parents. The drying of wetlands can cause increased accessibility of the nests leading to predation while a rise in the water level can submerge nests. Loss and degradation of habitat are the main threats facing the black-necked cranes. The problems are most serious in the wintering areas, where wetlands are extensively affected by human activity including irrigation, dam construction, draining, and grazing pressure. In Tibet, widespread changes in traditional agricultural practices have reduced the availability of waste barley and spring wheat. Populations in Bhutan are well protected both culturally and legally although some disturbance from tourism exists. The black-necked crane is evaluated as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix I of CITES.

Its total area is , located entirely within √Ñlvdalen Municipality in the province of Dalarna. It is named after the mountain Fulufj√§llet, high. It covers the Swedish part of the Fulufj√§llet massif, which is the southernmost part of the Scandes in Sweden. The Norwegian part of the massif is protected by Norway's Fulufjellet National Park. The park is one of Sweden's most recent, inaugurated in September 2002 by King Carl XVI Gustaf at a ceremony attended by a few thousand spectators. The park has become one of the initial PAN Parks, an international project to combine preservation with tourism. The Fulufj√§llet massif is a high plateau deeply gouged by several rivers that flow into the mighty river Dal√§lven, which, far downstream, creates the unique topography of F√§rnebofj√§rden National Park. The geography is dominated by lichen, bare mountains, and valleys with dense old-growth forest. The heaths of brush, grass and lichens are unique in the Scandinavian Mountains, a result of the absence of grazing reindeers. The park is a notable location for several species of birds, as well as brown bears and Eurasian lynx. The bold Siberian jay is the park's symbol. Notable sights include Sweden's largest waterfall, Njupesk√§r, with a total height of , and a free fall of . Growing in the park is the Old Tjikko, one of the world's oldest trees.  Toponymy  The origin of the name is not known for certain: the suffix -fj√§llet means \\"the mountain\\", but the first part (Fulu-) is not clear.p. 50 In Ortnamn i Dalarna, Harry St√•hl suggests that this word comes from the Old Swedish fala meaning \\"pale\\" or \\"dim\\", like the names of the city of Falun and of the river Fulan. The mountain would have thus taken its name from the nearby river, or else from the city: a former road going from Trysil to Falun would indeed have gone over the mountain, and might therefore have been called \\"the mountain on Falun's road\\".  Geography  Location and borders = Fulufj√§llet National Park is in √Ñlvdalen Municipality in Dalarna County, southwest of S√§rna.p. 5 It extends along the Norwegian frontier over more than (which is ). It borders, on the other side of this national frontier, Fulufjellet National Park, which has an area of more than . It is relatively far from the large cities of the country, Stockholm being about away; the nearest railway station and airport are at Mora, from the park.p. 54 = Topology = Map of Fulufj√§llet National Park in Sweden, together with Norway's Fulufjellet National Park The park covers most of the Fulufj√§llet massif (called Fulufjellet in Norwegian), which is long, and which spans the border between Sweden and Norway, so that a small southwestern part of it is in Norway.p. 31 This massif makes up part of the Transtrandsfj√§llen, which is the southernmost part of the Scandes in Sweden.p. 11 Fulufj√§llet is a plateau of an altitude between with some round peaks. Slottet, in altitude, the highest point of the massif, is in Norway. On the Swedish side, in Fulufj√§llet National Park, the highest point is Brattfj√§llet at , followed close behind by Storh√∂n at .p. 20 At the southern and eastern extremities of the massif, the altitude drops brutally, about to the valley of Fulu√§lven. The plateau is gouged by several valleys, facing west (Berg√•dalen, Gir√•dalen), south (Tang√•dalen) and east (G√∂lj√•dalen). = Climate = Fulufj√§llet is one of the parts of Scandinavia farthest from the sea. It therefore possesses a continental climate.p. 12 The average temperature in the park is about 1 ¬∞C, with relatively high rainfall ( per year on average). The weather survey at nearby S√§rna gives an indication; but, being situated in a valley, its climate is drier. Although winter is drier than summer, the snow cover typically persists for 175 to 200 days each year. However, Fulufj√§llet's weather is very variable over time and space, both in terms of temperature and precipitation.p. 15 In particular, the area experienced an extreme storm the night of 30‚Äì31 August 1997. At the lakes of R√∂sj√∂arna, of rain were collected in and the rainfall is estimated at 300 to further south. This was the largest amount of rain in a 24-hour period ever recorded in Sweden. There was significant damage in the park, in particular along the streams, the banks of which were violently eroded, ripping out all the vegetation there. Traces from the destruction from a great 1997 storm 1997 at the river Stora G√∂lj√•n = Hydrography = Mountain stream on Fulufj√§llet Many rivers have their source on the Fulufj√§llet massif, the principal ones being the Tang√•n (1.5 m3‚ãÖs‚àí1), the Gir√•n, the Berg√•n, the Fulub√•gan, the Stora Njup√•n, and the Stora G√∂lj√•n (0.4 m3‚ãÖs‚àí1).p. 24p. 15 The first three feed the river G√∂r√§lven, which runs along the Fulufj√§llet massif to the west, while the last three feed the river Fulan (also called Fulu√§lven), which runs along the massif to the east. The meeting of the G√∂r√§lven and Fulan gives birth to the V√§sterdal River, which itself forms the great river Dal√§lven. One of the park's streams, Njup√•n, forms to the north of the plateau the waterfall Njupesk√§r, with a height of of which are free-fall, making it the highest waterfall in Sweden. The plateau, and in particular its southern part of less sharp topology, includes several important lakes, such as the Stora R√∂sj√∂n (), Stora and Lilla Harrsj√∂n (), Stora Getsj√∂n (), etc.p. 26 These lakes are most often shallow and the abundance of precipitation refills them rapidly. This zone also includes many bogs with a total area of more than ,p. 8 which is relatively little compared to the surrounding mountains.p. 23  Geology  Rock = The Fulufj√§llet massif is mostly sandstone.p. 25 The sandstone was formed 900 million years ago, when this part of the Baltic tectonic plate was located near the equator.p. 27 The climatic conditions there were thus desertic and the wind blew huge quantities of sand from the dunes into the ocean. These sediments were compacted at the bottom of the ocean and formed rock, specifically sandstone, in horizontal strata. This structure has been conserved, since it was little affected by the Caledonian orogeny. This sandstone formation is very different from the rock one typically finds in Sweden (granite and gneiss). It is also very different from the rest of the Scandes, which are part of the Caledonian orogen. This sandstone is called the Dalecarlian sandstone, or the sandstone of Trysil on the Norwegian side. It constitutes the largest sandstone area in Sweden and reaches a thickness of . The sandstone is usually reddish, but can also be gray, yellow, or brown. At Fulufj√§llet, the sandstone is veined with diabase. This diabase is particularly important in the area, since it forms a much richer substrate than sandstone for vegetation. Additionally, it resists erosion better than sandstone and therefore forms prominent structures in the countryside. For example, the peak Brattfj√§llet, highest zone in the park, is situated in one of the largest diabase zones. The diabase is a little less than 300 million years old, which corresponds to the formation of the Oslo Rift. This suggests that these diabases are connected to that rifting event. = Formation of the countryside = The same forces that created the rest of the Scandes also created Fulufj√§llet. Indeed, from about 60 million years ago, the west coast of Scandinavia and the northeast coast of the Americas underwent an important tectonic uplift. The causes of this phenomenon are not clear and many hypotheses have been proposed. One of these hypotheses is the lifting of the Earth's crust by the Iceland hotspot. Another hypothesis is isostasy connected to glaciation. This elevation seems to have been connected to different periods in the north and south of the Scandes, with the middle, between Trondheim and √ñstersund, a little depressed. In any case, this uplift allowed the formation of a vast flat zone several thousand meters high. This area then underwent intense erosion, giving the countryside the shape one sees today. However, unlike the southernmost sections of the Scandes, such as those around Sarek National Park, the countryside around Fulufj√§llet is not particularly marked by glacial erosion. Indeed, even at the height of glaciation during the Quaternary period, when the mountain was covered by an ice sheet, the movement of the ice was feeble, and did not significantly erode the massif.p. 35 Instead, the most marked erosion took place during the Tertiary period, entirely under a tropical climate.  Environment  The park is situated in the WWF terrestrial ecoregion Scandinavian and Russian taiga, even though a significant portion is situated above the treeline, and therefore becomes more like the Scandinavian Montane Birch forest and grasslands ecoregion. = The plateau = Northern wheatear Because of the weather and the poverty of the soil, the plateau is mostly heath and bare dirt with only a few common juniper shrubs and some moor birches.p. 12 The principal vascular plants one encounters are snowbed willow, Alpine bearberry, Alpine hawkweed, crowberry, cowberry, blue whortleberry and alpine azalea.p. 36p. 20 But that which renders the vegetation of the Fulufj√§llet plateau particularly unique in Sweden is its richness in lichens, with in particular the vast carpets of reindeer lichen and of f√∂nsterlav, not affected there by the pasture of domestic reindeer, unlike most of the Swedish mountains. It is also in these inaccessible areas that one finds Old Tjikko, a Norway spruce old, making it one of the oldest trees in the world. Few animals live in these areas; birds, mostly, such as the willow warbler, the meadow pipit, the northern wheatear, and these rarer ones: the European golden plover, the Eurasian dotterel, the snow bunting, and the Lapland longspur.p. 29 The willow ptarmigan is relatively common, whereas the rock ptarmigan is found only on the highest peaks. For many of these species, Fulufj√§llet is the southernmost part of their range in Sweden.p. 151 = Valleys and mountainside = Forest on the slopes of Fulufj√§llet In the valleys and on the mountainside, in contrast, the diabase and the better weather permit a richer vegetation. In particular, these areas are blanketed in forest, with the plant species varying with altitude: moor birch, Scots pine and Norway spruce cover , and , respectively. The undergrowth also presents great diversity in plant life. To wit, the south-facing slopes are principally covered in Scots pines and their undergrowth strongly resembles heath, with in particular common heather and crowberry.p. 22 The rest of the coniferous forests include most often whortleberry, northern oak fern, woundwort, and common cow-wheat. The soil rich in diabase allows the growth of more demanding plants, such as Alpine blue-sow-thistle, wood cranesbill and northern wolfsbane. These zones also have a great number of species of moss; the park has more than a third of all the species of moss in the country. The animal life in these areas is also relatively rich. The zone is particularly important to the brown bear, which likes to hibernate the winter away in dens along the mountainside.p. 28 In spring, the brown bears descent to the plains, and only return to the mountain when the berries do.p. 140 These terrains are also favored stomping grounds of the Eurasian lynx. Both species, brown bear and Eurasian lynx, are protected in Sweden. Besides the red fox, the other predators, which are the wolverine, the gray wolf and the Arctic fox, are much rarer and do not have a fixed location in the park. The park shelters an important population of moose that pass the summer on the mountain, but prefer to spend the winter in areas less snowy. There are no more wild reindeerin the park, which is part of those few Swedish mountains not included in the area of pasture of domestic reindeer.p. 15 Muskox, which left the area almost 4,000 years ago, were reintroduced in Norway and sometimes wander near the park.p. 142 Among the smaller animals, one can cite the red squirrel, the European pine marten, and the mountain hare. Like other Swedish mountains, the Norway lemming is present in Fulufj√§llet, but in a patchy fashion, extremely numerous some years and almost absent others. This phenomenon is still not entirely understood.p. 141 The wooded slopes are host to their own bird species, in particular the ring ouzel, the common raven, and the golden eagle. More generally, the forests have Eurasian three-toed woodpeckers, parrot crossbills, red crossbills, common redstarts, bramblings and Siberian jays, which last bird is the symbol of the park.p. 67 = Wetlands = Wetlands on the plateau of Fulufj√§llet European beaver Several marsh complexes exist in the park, but they are generally poor in vegetation, except for certain zones that the diabase rends richer in nutrients. However, along the mountainside streams, a rich carpet of vegetation was able to develop, with in particular alternate-leaved golden- saxifrage, chickweed willowherb, wolfsbane and wood stitchwort. At Njupesk√§r, conditions are especially favorable for the growth of wood sorrel, which does not normally grow so far south.p. 37 These wetlands are also the most interesting areas for mosses and lichens;p. 164p. 169 Fulufj√§llet is one of the richest sites in all Sweden, with 394 species of moss and over 500 species of lichens found.p. 19 The presence of these lichens is in part due to the fact that the park is not part of the territory of reindeer pasture. These areas of water are inhabited by Eurasian beaver, which had disappeared some years ago due to intensive hunting, but which have now recovered their original population. Besides this, it is mostly a richness of birds that distinguishes the park's wetlands. It constitutes the southernmost extent in Sweden of the nesting area of many species, such as the greater scaup, the oldsquaw, the common scoter, and also a focus of important populations of red- necked phalarope, ruff, common greenshank and wood sandpiper.p. 29 One also finds sometimes the Eurasian curlew, which is considered an endangered species.p. 27 The lakes are mainly populated with Arctic char, brown trout, and burbot.p. 30 The waters of the park are renowned for their abundance and have been protected since 1962.  History  Prehistory = Unlike the Norwegian part of the massif, the Swedish part is relatively poorly studied from an archeological point of view; as is often the case in the mountains, human traces are light.p. 40 The mountain was freed from ice about 8,000p. 47 to 10,000 years ago and the first humans arrived during the Stone Age, their presence attested to by certain relics, such as a stone axe near the river Fulan.p. 51 These people were hunter-gatherers, and had no fixed settlement, which remained the case up until the Iron Age. Four Iron Age funerary cairns are among the most notable traces of that era. They are the only ones that have been discovered in Dalarna. They can be found in the northeast of the plateau, southeast of Njupesk√§r, and measure in length and a little less than meter in height.p. 52 The tombs held arrowheads and spears. Another notable site is the Altarringen, an oval wall in diameter and high.p. 41 In the middle of this ruin, an altar was created. Dating this ruin is difficult because of the numerous restorations it underwent. However, during the Viking Age, some permanent settlements were constructed around Mora, for example, and one can figure that the first permanent settlements would have been established in the valleys of Fulufj√§llet before the year 1000. = Middle Ages and the modern period = The city of R√∏ros in Norway used enormous amounts of wood for its mine The villages of S√§rna, Heden and Idre were probably established in connection with wild reindeer hunting; a trade in reindeer products existed with all of Europe. However, this trade declined in the 14th century. In the Middle Ages, the area was frequently mapped, due to its location on the Sweden-Norway frontier, which has existed since 1273. In that era, the massif was entirely Norwegian, but in 1644, Sweden succeeded in capturing S√§rna during the Torstenson War.p. 55-56 However, in 1645, the Second Treaty of Br√∂msebro failed to clearly define the frontier, and not until 1751, after negotiations, was the current frontier established. If the wrangling over the border seemed to take forever, all the more so since the zone was so trivial. The area around the mountain was not settled until later. This began on the Norwegian side: there was at least one farm at Lj√∏rdalen in 1528. Not until the 18th century did the Swedish part become populated, initially with cabins for transhumance, for example at M√∂rkret. Virtual villages grew up after the beginning of the 19th century at G√∂rdalen, Storb√§cken, Storbron, H√§gn√•sen, M√∂rkret, Tj√§rnvallen and Lill√•dalen. Many of the park trails date from this era of transhumance. Up until the 18th century, the area was used as a common hunting ground and pasture. Even though the mines at R√∏ros required vast quantities of wood and coal, Fulufj√§llet's transport problems initially spared it from logging. It was not until the second part of the 19th century that the logging industry took hold of the region, the wood being transported then by timber rafting.p. 44 The river G√∂r√§lven was used at first, once certain conflicts with Norway were put to rest. Exploitation of natural resources did not reach the most inaccessible zones until later, and certain parts were never exploited at all. Among the other forms of exploitation of the zone, one can note the exploitation of a form of sandstone in the valley of Tang√•dalen.p. 42 = Protection = The first protection of the zone was the classification in 1937 of around Njupesk√§r as a crown reserve ('), which was the ancestor of the natural reserve in Sweden.p. 69 In 1946, of forest along the G√∂lj√•n was similarly classified. Then around L√∂v√•sen were as well, and finally the reserve at Njupesk√§r was expanded to in 1960. In 1964, the Njupesk√§r area became a natural park and was expanded to , and expanded again to in 1970. In parallel, most of Fulufj√§llet obtained a statute of protection, although relatively weak. In 1973, the entire area, totaling came under the statute of natural reserves. In 1990, the pasturing of reindeer was forbidden. In 1989, Fulufj√§llet appeared in Naturv√•rdsverket's plan for the creation of new national parks.p. 71 Negotiation with local authorities began the following year, but the project met opposition from the local population.p. 176 One of the arguments in favor of the creation of the park, beyond the simple protection of nature, was that it would draw more tourists, especially foreigners;p. 174 this was particularly important since while Idre and S√§len had succeeded in developing winter tourism, S√§rna had not. The project's opponents retorted that there was no reason that European tourists should choose to visit this distant mountain over the Alpes.p. 178 Besides that, the national park would necessitate a certain number of restrictions on the locals such as banning of snowmobile use, hunting, and fishing. The council of administration of √Ñlvdalen Municipality heard the locals' negative opinion, and so opposed itself to the creation of the park. Naturv√•rdsverket and Dalarna County thus changed their strategy, and surveyed the locals to learn how they thought the mountain ought to be used.p. 179 Discussions continued following the publication of this study, and in 1999, the locals began to express favorable opinions. The park was no longer seen as a set of restrictions, but as an opportunity for the municipality. This led to the creation of the park in 2002.p. 1 The official motive for the creation of the park was \\"to preserve an area of the central mountains with a distinctive vegetation and a great natural richness in a relatively intact state\\". It was the first Swedish national park established in the mountains since Padjelanta in 1962.p. 6 The official inauguration was held 17 September 2002, in the presence of the king Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden. The park is also part of the Natura 2000 Network since 1995 and is classified a Special Protection Area for the preservation of birds since 1996. The park became one of the first parks of the European network of PAN Parks, created by the WWF to reconcile the protection of nature and tourism.p. 72 At the moment of the inauguration of the Swedish park, the Norwegian part of the massif had no formal protection and did not appear in the plan for the creation of national parks of 1992. But this creation raised the question of the establishment of a national park on the Norwegian side, in order to have a more coherent protection of the whole massif. In 27April 2012, the Fulufjellet National Park was created. Beyond the coherence of protection, one of the principal reasons for the establishment of that park was the presence of brown bears, a species classified as endangered in the country.  Management and administration  The visitor center of Fulufj√§llet National Park Like most of the Swedish national parks, the management and administration are divided between the Swedish environmental protection agency and the administrative council of the counties of Sweden (L√§nsstyrelse). Naturv√•rdsverket is responsible for proposing new national parks, through consultation with the administrative councils of the counties and municipalities; their creation is approved by the Riksdag (Sweden's parliament). Once approved, the land is then bought by the state, through the intermediary of the Naturv√•rdsverket. The management of the park is then in the hands of the county, which is to say of the administrative council of Dalarna, in the case of Fulufj√§llet National Park. The park is divided into four zones, which have different purposes, in order to reconcile the protection of the park and the welcoming of tourists. This is the first Swedish park to adopt this strict kind of zoning.p. 76 The majority of the park (60%) is in zone 1, that is to say the untouchable zone: this space is the heart of the park and only has a tiny amount of tourism infrastructure.p. 77 The south-east zone of the park (14%) is in zone 2, the low activity area.p. 79 In this zone, elk hunting is allowed, but infrastructure is always limited. 25% of the park is in zone 3, the high activity zone. This zone includes most of the tourism infrastructure, such as the trails and the cabins. Fishing is authorized there. Finally, zone 4 (about 1% of the area of the park) corresponds to a radius of about around the points of strong concentration of visitors, which is to say the entrances, the waterfall of Njupesk√§r and the valley of G√∂lj√•n, where the traces of a great flood are still visible.p. 80  Tourism  In winter, the waterfall at Njupesk√§r freezes and becomes a good support for ice climbers The park is the southernmost of Sweden's mountain parks, and so closest of these parks to the majority of the country's population.p. 53 It welcomed 53,000 visitors in 2003 (of which 80% arrived in the summer),p. 56 which is an increase of about 40% compared to 2001, before the creation of the national park.p. 14 About a third of these visitors are from outside Sweden, mainly from Germany. The main motivation of these visits is waterfall at Njupesk√§r,p. 15 the tallest waterfall in Sweden at , of which are free fall. The damage from a great storm in 1997, still visible not far from the waterfall, is also an important point of interest for the tourists.p. 19 The park's main entrance, with parking, is situated near these two sites. Near this entrance you can find the park's visitor center, which has exhibits on the nature of the park and is the departure point for guided tours. It is also the starting point of many of the trails of the park, the park having of hiking trails. Among these trails, one can note a part of the S√∂dra Kungsleden (S√§len-Storlien, totaling ).p. 55 The short hike (between 1 and 3 hours) is the most common activity, but a non- negligible proportion of visitors go on longer hikes (several days), which is particularly true of the German visitors.p. 89 In winter, skiing is possible, but it is however relatively little popular due to the lack of dedicated trails.p. 57 Ice climbing is also practiced on Njupesk√§r.p. 58 Fishing is also allowed, upon the purchase of a permit.p. 62  Fulufj√§llet in popular culture  The children's song Mors lilla Olle by Alice Tegn√©r is set in the forests of Fulufj√§llet. Its story is inspired by a real event: during the winter of 1850‚Äì1851, four children were playing in the forest. One of them, Jon, was just one and a half. They met a bear and its cub.p. 149 Jon crawled to the bear, who caressed him and fed him berries. When the toddler's mother arrived, she screamed, which made the bears flee. The little boy had thought that the bears were big black dogs.

Similar to his predecessor, successor or co-ruler Seth-Peribsen, Sekhemib is contemporarily well attested in archaeological records, but he does not appear in any posthumous document. The exact length of his reign is unknown and his burial site has yet to be found.  Name sources  Sekhemib's name is known from seal impressions and from inscriptions on vessels made of alabaster and breccia. They were found in the entrance of Peribsen's tomb at Abydos, in the underground galleries beneath the step pyramid of (3rd Dynasty) king Djoser at Sakkara and on one excavation site at Elephantine.Toby A.

Sekhemib's serekh name is unusual, because it is the first in Egyptian history that was extended by an epithet. Beside the first name, Sekhem-ib, several seal impressions and stone vessel inscriptions show the epithet Perenma'at inside the serekh. Sekhemib used both name forms, the single horus name and the double name, at the same time. Egyptologists such as Herman te Velde and Wolfgang Helck think that the double name of Sekhemib came in use when the Egyptian state was split into two independent realms. It seems that Sekhemib tried to stress the peaceful political situation prevailing in Egypt at the time. An increased form of such a double name was created and used by a successor of Sekhemib, king Khasekhemwy. This king also used a double name and even placed Horus and Seth together as protective deities atop his serekh. Khasekhemwy had tried to express peace and reconciliation between Upper- and Lower Egypt with his unusual serekh, too.Herman te Velde: Seth, God of Confusion: a study of his role in Egyptian mythology and religion. Brill, Leiden 1977, , page 72, 73 & 110.  Identity  Vase of Sekhemib bearing the inscription reproduced on the right. At its right, it reads The king of Upper and Lower Egypt, Sekhemib-Perenmaat, at its left it reads administrator of the house of copper, god servant of Kherty, National Archaeological Museum (France). The historical figure of Sekhemib is the subject of investigation and discussions by Egyptologists and historians to this day. The contradictory findings allow room for plenty of interpretations and theories. Egyptologists such as Walter Bryan Emery, Kathryn A. Bard and Flinders Petrie believe that Sekhemib was the same person as king Peribsen, a ruler who had connected his name with the deity Seth and who possibly ruled only Upper Egypt. Emery, Bard and Petrie point to several clay seals that were found in the tomb entrance of Peribsen's necropolis. Sekhemib's tomb has not yet been found.Walter Bryan Emery: √Ñgypten - Geschichte und Kultur der Fr√ºhzeit. Fourier, Munich 1964, page 106.J. P.

Bard: The Emergence of the Egyptian State. in: Ian Shaw: The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt. page 86. In contrast, Egyptologists such as Hermann Alexander Schl√∂gl, Wolfgang Helck, Peter Kaplony and Jochem Kahl believe that Sekhemib was a different ruler to Peribsen. They point out that the clay seals were only found at the entrance area of Peribsen's tomb and that none of them ever shows Peribsen and Sekhemib's names together in one inscription. They compare the findings with the ivory tablets of king Hotepsekhemwy found at the entrance of king Qaa's tomb. Therefore, Schl√∂gl, Helck, Kaplony and Kahl are convinced that Sekhemib's seals are merely proof that Sekhemib buried Peribsen.Wolfgang Helck: Untersuchungen zur Thintenzeit. (√Ñgyptologische Abhandlungen, Volume 45), Otto Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 1987, , page 104‚Äì111 & 183.Hermann A. Schl√∂gl: Das Alte √Ñgypten. Geschichte und Kultur von der Fr√ºhzeit bis zu Kleopatra. Verlag C. H. Beck, M√ºnchen 2006, , page 78. Egyptologists such as Toby Wilkinson and Helck believe that Sekhemib and Peribsen could have been related. Their theory is based on the stone vessel inscriptions and seal impressions that show strong similarities in their typographical and grammatical writing styles. The vessels of Peribsen for example show the notation \\"ini-setjet\\" (\\"tribute of the people of Sethro√´\\"), whilst Sekhemib's inscriptions note \\"ini-chasut\\" (\\"tribute of the desert nomads\\"). A further indication for a relationship between Peribsen and Sekhemib is the serekh-name of both, as they both use the syllables \\"per\\" and \\"ib\\" in their names.Siegfried Schott: Alt√§gyptische Festdaten. Verlag der Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur, Mainz/Wiesbaden 1950, page 55.Toby Wilkinson: Early Dynastic Egypt. page 90‚Äì91; see also: Walter Bryan Emery: √Ñgypten ‚Äì Geschichte und Kultur der Fr√ºhzeit. page 106. Egyptologists such as Helck identify Sekhemib with the ramesside cartouche name ‚ÄúWadjenes‚Äù and equate Peribsen with a king named Senedj. Egyptologist Dietrich Wildung thinks alike and identifies Sekhemib with the nebty name Weneg-Nebty and Peribsen with Senedj.Dietrich Wildung: Die Rolle √§gyptischer K√∂nige im Bewu√ütsein ihrer Nachwelt. Volume I: Posthume Quellen √ºber die K√∂nige der ersten vier Dynastien. M√ºnchener √Ñgyptologische Studien, Volume. 17, Deutscher Kunstverlag, Munich/Berlin, 1969. page 14 & 250.  Reign  Clay seal of Sekhemib There seems to be archaeological evidence that Sekhemib ruled only in Upper Egypt. His realm would have extended down from Ombos up to the Isle of Elephantine, where a new administrative centre called \\"The white house of treasury\\" was founded under Peribsen.Jean-Pierre-P√§tznik: Die Siegelabrollungen und Rollsiegel der Stadt Elephantine im 3. Jahrtausend vor Christus. Archaeopress, Oxford (UK) 2005, , page 64‚Äì66. It remains the subject of discussion by Egyptologists and historians as to if, why and when it was decided to split the state. = Proponents of the divided-realm-theory = Egyptologists such as Wolfgang Helck, Nicolas Grimal, Hermann Alexander Schl√∂gl and Francesco Tiradritti believe that king Ninetjer, the third ruler of 2nd dynasty and a predecessor of Peribsen, left a realm that was suffering from an overly complex state administration and that Ninetjer decided to split Egypt between his two sons (or, at least, his two successors), in the hope that the two rulers could better administer the two states.Nicolas Grimal: A History of Ancient Egypt. Wiley-Blackwell, Weinheim 1994, , page 55.Francesco Tiradritti & Anna Maria Donadoni Roveri: Kemet: Alle Sorgenti Del Tempo. Electa, Milano 1998, , page 80‚Äì85. Since the artefacts surviving from his lifetime seem to prove that he and his contemporary Peribsen ruled only in Upper Egypt, it is the subject of investigation as to who ruled in Lower Egypt at that time. The Ramesside king lists differ in their succession of royal names from king Senedj onward. A reason may be that the royal table of Saqqara and the royal canon of Turin reflect Memphite traditions, which allow Memphite rulers to be mentioned. The Abydos king list instead reflects Thinite traditions and therefore only Thinite rulers appear on that list. Until king Senedj, all posthumous king lists accord with each other. After him, the Saqqara list and the Turin list mention three kings as successors: Neferkara I, Neferkasokar and Hudjefa I. The Abydos king list skips these kings and jumps forward to Khasekhemwy, calling him ‚ÄúDjadjay‚Äù. The discrepancies are considered by Egyptologists to be the result of the partition of the Egyptian state during the 2nd Dynasty. A further problem is the Horus names and Nebty names of different kings in inscriptions found in the Great Southern Gallery in the necropolis of (3rd Dynasty) king Djoser at Saqqara. Stone vessel inscriptions mention kings such as Nubnefer, Weneg-Nebty, Horus Ba, Horus \\"Bird\\" and Za, but each of these kings is mentioned only a few times, which suggests to Egyptologists that each of these kings did not rule very long. King Sneferka might be identical with king Qa'a or an ephemeral successor of his. King Weneg-Nebty might be identical with the Ramesside cartouche name Wadjenes. But kings such as \\"Nubnefer\\", \\"Bird\\" and \\"Za\\" remain a mystery. They never appear anywhere else in the historical record other than at Saqqara where the number of objects surviving from their lifetimes is very limited. Schl√∂gl, Helck and Peter Kaplony postulate that Nubnefer, Za and Bird were the corresponding rulers to Peribsen and Sekhemib and ruled in Lower Egypt, whilst the latter two ruled Upper Egypt.Peter Kaplony: A building named \\"Menti-Ankh\\". In: Mitteilungen des Deutschen Arch√§ologischen Instituts Kairo (MDAIK), volume 20. de Gruyter, Berlin 1965, page 1‚Äì46. In contrast, Egyptologists such as Barbara Bell believe that an economic catastrophe such as a famine or a long- lasting drought affected Egypt at that time. To help solve the problems of feeding the Egyptian population, Ninetjer split the realm and his successors ruled two independent realms until the famine was successfully brought to an end. Bell points to the inscriptions of the Palermo stone, where, in her opinion, the records of the Nile floods show consistently low levels.Barbara Bell: Oldest Records of the Nile Floods, In: Geographical Journal, No. 136. 1970, page 569‚Äì573; M. Goedike: Journal of Egypt Archaeology, No. 42. 1998, page 50. The administrative titles of the scribes, seal-bearers and overseers were adjusted to the new political situation. For example, titles like \\"sealer of the king\\" were changed into \\"sealer of the king of Upper Egypt\\". The administration system since the time of Peribsen and Sekhemib shows a clear and well identified hierarchy; an example: Treasury house ‚Üí pension office ‚Üí property ‚Üí vine yards ‚Üí private vine yard. King Khasekhemwy, the last ruler of 2nd Dynasty, was able to re-unify the state administration of Egypt and therefore unite the whole of Ancient Egypt. He brought the two treasury houses of Egypt under the control of the \\"House of the King\\", bringing them into a new, single administration center.Jean-Pierre P√§tznick: Die Siegelabrollungen und Rollsiegel der Stadt Elephantine im 3. Jahrtausend v. Chr. page 211‚Äì213; see also: Jean-Pierre P√§tznick in: Mitteilungen des Deutschen √Ñgyptologischen Instituts Kairo.

The inscription reads (from right to left): \\"King of Lower- and Upper Egypt, Sekhemib-Per(enma'at), tribute of the foreigners, provisions to...\\". = Opponents of the divided-realm-theory = Other Egyptologists, such as Michael Rice,Michael Rice: Who's Who in Ancient Egypt. Routledge, London/New York 2001, , page 72, 134 & 172. Francesco Tiradritti and Wolfgang Helck, believe that there was no division of the Egyptian thrones and that Sekhemib and Peribsen were each sole and independent rulers. The suspected division may have been of a mere bureaucratic nature, including changes in the titles of high-ranking officials. It is possible, that king Nynetjer (or Peribsen) decided to split the whole bureaucracy of Egypt into two separate departments in an attempt to reduce the power of the officials. Such an act was not surprising and occurred several times in Egyptian history, especially in later dynasties. The scholars also point to the once palatial and well preserved mastaba tombs at Saqqara and Abydos belonging to high officials such as Ruaben and Nefer-Setekh. These are all dated from the reign of Nynetjer to that of Khasekhemwy, the last ruler of the Second Dynasty. Egyptologists consider the archaeological record of the mastabas' condition and the original architecture as proof that the statewide mortuary cults for kings and noblemen successfully operated during the entire dynasty. If true, their preservation is inconsistent with the theory of civil wars and economic problems during Peribsen's reign. Rice, Tiradritti and Helck think that Nynetjer decided to leave a divided realm because of private or political reasons and that the split was a formality sustained by Second Dynasty kings.Wolfgang Helck: Untersuchungen zur Thinitenzeit (= √Ñgyptologische Abhandlungen, Vol. 45). Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 1987, , p. 103-111. Scholars such as Herman TeVelde,Herman te Velde: Seth, God of Confusion.

Edwards (Hrsg.): Early history of the middle east (= The Cambridge ancient history. Vol. 1‚Äì2), 3rd edition. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1970, , p.31-32. and Toby Wilkinson believe the inscription of the famous Annal stone of Fifth Dynasty, a black olivine-basalt slabstone displaying a very detailed king list, also argues against the division of the realm. On the stone, the kings are listed by their Horus name, their gold name, their cartouche name, and, finally, with the name of their royal mother. The lists also contain rectangular windows presenting year events from the day of the king's coronation to his death. The most famous fragments of the Annal stone are called the Palermo Stone and the Cairo Stone. On the Cairo stone, in line IV, the last nine years of king Nynetjer are preserved (but most of the year windows are illegible now).Toby A. H. Wilkinson: Royal annals of ancient Egypt: The Palermo stone and its associated fragments. Taylor and Francis, London 2000, , p. 200‚Äì206. The Annal stone however, gives absolutely no indication of a division of the Egyptian realm. Barta, TeVelde, Wilkinson and Edwards argue that the theory of state division is untenable. A mere administrative reorganization of the bureaucracy or a split in the priesthood sects seems more likely. Bell's theory of a famine or drought is refuted today by Egyptologists such as Stephan Seidlmayer, who corrected Bell's calculations. Seidlmayer has shown that the annual Nile flood was normal during Ninetjer's time up to the period of the Old Kingdom. Bell may have overlooked that the height of the Nile floods in the Palermo stone inscriptions only takes into account the measurements of the nilometers around Memphis, and not elsewhere along the river. Any long-lasting drought at that time can therefore be excluded.Stephan Seidlmayer: Historische und moderne Nilst√§nde: Historische und moderne Nilst√§nde: Untersuchungen zu den Pegelablesungen des Nils von der Fr√ºhzeit bis in die Gegenwart. Achet, Berlin 2001, , page 87‚Äì89. Three officials from Sekhemib's reign are known to Egyptologists by seal impressions: Nebhotep, Inykhnum and Maapermin. However, Inykhnum might also have held office in later times, under kings such as Djoser and Sanakht.Peter Kaplony: Inschriften der √§gyptischen Fr√ºhzeit. Otto Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 1963, Band III, , page 406‚Äì479. Tomb The location of Sekhemib's tomb is unknown. If he was actually the same person as Peribsen, he was buried in tomb P at Abydos. If not, his burial site may be located at Saqqara.

The reasoning behind the minute amount of ice in the area is still relatively unknown and remains under intense debate amongst scientists today. The Bunger Hills are located with its center at , stretching from 65¬∞58'S to 66¬∞20'S and from 100¬∞20'E to 101¬∞28'E. The Bunger Hills are marked by numerous melt ponds and are nearly bisected by an east-west trending Algae Lake (also known as Lake Figurnoye). Mapped from air photos taken by the United States Navy Operation Highjump (1946-1947) and named by the United States Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) for Lieutenant Commander David E. Bunger, United States Navy, plane commander of one of the three USN OpHjp aircraft which engaged in photographic missions along most of the coastal area between 14 E and 164 E. David E. Bunger and members of his crew landed their airplane on an unfrozen lake here in February 1947. The Bunger Hills are surrounded by glaciers. On the southeast the Bunger Hills is bordered by the steep slopes of the Antarctic ice sheet, on the south and west by outlet glaciers, and on the north by Shackleton Ice Shelf, which separates the area from the open sea. The ice-free area measures , according to some sources even (though these latter values include a marine area not covered by continental ice or the Shackleton Ice Shelf). The topography is characterized by rugged hills, and there are many freshwater and salt lakes. The largest and deepest lake, Algae Lake (Lake Figurnoye) is long and up to deep. The leader of Operation Highjump, Admiral Richard E. Byrd stated that the Bunger Hills was ‚Äò‚Ä¶one of the most remarkable regions on earth. An island suitable for life had been found in a universe of death.‚Äô Byrd, R.E. (1947) Our navy explores Antarctica. National Geographic Magazine, 92: 429-522. Cape Hordern is an ice- free cape, overlain by morainic drift, at the western end of the Bunger Hills. It was first observed by members of the western party of the Australian Antarctic Expedition (1911-1914), who were unable to reach it due to heavy crevassing on the Denman and Scott Glaciers.  Stations  The Soviet Union built a scientific station by the name of Oazis (–û–∞–∑–∏—Å) in the center of the area at , starting October 15, 1956, with two buildings for eight people. The station was handed over to Poland on January 23, 1959, and was renamed A. B. Dobrowolski Station (named after Antoni Dobrowolski). It continued to be occupied for a few weeks only thereafter. On February 22, 1979 (with preparations starting February 18) the station was reactivated for a short time, but an overwintering attempt failed, and the occupants had to be evacuated to Mirny Station ( to the west) on March 17. The concrete pillar erected by the First Polish Antarctic Expedition at Dobrowolski Station in January 1959 for gravity measurements, and the magnetic observatory at the station with plaque in memory of the opening of Oazis Station in 1956, are recognized as Antarctic Historic Sites. The Soviet Union became interested in the Bunger Hills again in the late 1980s, and built a new station - Oazis 2 - a few hundred metres to the west of Dobrowolski. The station was used for summer visits up to the mid-1990s. About west-northwest of Dobrowolski, at , Australia has maintained the summer-only station Edgeworth David Base, named after Edgeworth David, since 1986.

The instrument consists of a semicircular wooden soundboard, approximately by in size, with iron or brass nails of different lengths arranged to produce a chromatic scale when bowed. History Wilde was inspired to create the instrument when he accidentally drew his bow across a metal peg, which produced a musical sound. The instrument consists of a semicircular wooden soundboard, approximately by in size, with iron or brass nails of different lengths arranged to produce a chromatic scale when bowed. The bow used was fitted with coarse black horsehair, which produced sound by friction. An improved instrument, now in the collection of the Hochschule in Berlin, has two half-moon sound-chests of different sizes, one on the top of the other, forming terraces. In the rounded wall of the upper sound-chest are two rows of iron staples, the upper giving the diatonic scale, and the lower the intermediate chromatic semitones. The instrument has a sweet bell-like tone but limited technical possibilities. History records the name of a single virtuoso on this instrument; he was a Bohemian musician called Senal, who travelled all over Germany with his instrument about 1780-1790\\\\. Senal had modified the instrument by adding sympathetic strings, and dubbed this enhanced version the \\"violino harmonico\\". There have been several other modifications or variations on Wilde's original design. Modifications include the use of glass or wooden rods instead of metal nails. Tr√§ger of Bernberg (Saxony) created a treadle-operated keyboard version in 1791. The Adiaphonon, created by Franz Schuster in 1818-1819, was similar to the nail violin. It used bowed steel rods and had a six octave range. Its range was F1-F7. A Nineteenth Century modification, called the Stockspiel or Melkharmonica, incorporated wooden rods, which were played using rosined gloves. Bill Wesley has invented the Array Nail Violin, in which the notes are arranged according to the Array system. It is played with the fingers, thumbs, and palms dusted with dancer's rosin. The waterphone works on similar principles, but is atonal rather than chromatic, and has water in its resonator. Musical instrument classification The instrument is categorized as a friction idiophone, as it is played by bowing. The instrument can also be played by striking the nails or rods. Michael Meadows has made contemporary copies of the early design of the instrument.

He attended Magdalen College, Oxford and graduated from there with a Master of Arts degree on 31 August 1636. He then succeeded to his father's title of Baron Spencer later that year on 19 December 1636. Family Dorothy Sidney (1617-1684) (Henry Pierce Bone) On 20 July 1639 at Penshurst, he married Lady Dorothy Sidney, daughter of Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester at Penshurst Place. It was generally believed to be a love marriage and had his father-in-law's warm approval: after Sunderland's death her father consoled Dorothy by reminding her of her happy marriage, which he was happy to have helped bring about. Sunderland and his wife had three children: *Lady Dorothy Spencer (1640‚Äì1670), married George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax and had issue. *Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland (1641‚Äì1702) *Lady Penelope Spencer (c. 1642‚Äì1667), died unmarried. Death  Henry fought in the Battle of Edgehill in 1642 and was rewarded for his services on 8 June 1643 by being created 1st Earl of Sunderland (although the title cost him ¬£3,000). He then fought in the Siege of Gloucester in August 1643 and the First Battle of Newbury on 20 September 1643, where he was killed, aged 22, by a cannonball. Cokayne writes that \\"he was, according to Clarendon, a lord of a great fortune, tender years ... and an early judgment; who, having no command in the army, attended upon the King's person under the obligation of honour; and putting himself that day into the King's troop a volunteer, before they came to charge was taken away by a cannon bullet.'\\"  Ancestry References Category:1620 births Category:1643 deaths Category:Cavaliers Category:English military personnel killed in action Category:Earls of Sunderland Henry Spencer, 1st Earl of Sunderland Category:People killed in the English Civil War ","title":"Henry Spencer, 1st Earl of Sunderland"},{"id":"2755371","text":"A single grain of patna rice Patna rice, a variety of the species Oryza sativa, and one of the varieties of long-grain white rice, is extensively cultivated in the Indo-Gangetic plains, in and around Patna, capital of Bihar state, India. Patna rice is known for its elongated kernel with grain length greater than 6 mm, and has been used as staple food by the local people for thousands of years. Sometimes, Patna rice is also called Parimal rice locally. This mildly flavoured rice comes from the Bihar region of the Ganges plains. It has a robust, long and narrow, opaque grain that keeps its shape well for curries. Basmati rice is closely related to the Patna rice but has a stronger aroma. The Mughal chronicler Abul Fazal who collected the various types of rice grown in the Gangetic belt has described the rice cultivated in Patna in glowing terms. William Fullarton of Skeldon UK made his fortune by dealing in Patna rice. He chose Patna as the name of the coal-miners' hamlet he built in East Ayrshire, Scotland. Since most of the rice sold in Europe came from this region at one time, the term \\"Patna rice\\" also sometimes loosely designates any long-grain aromatic rice. Another example of long-grain rice is American long-grain rice which include Carolina rice. It is believed that Patna rice was the first type of rice cultivated in America, and acquired the name Carolina rice. The seeds of Patna rice were taken to America, grown in Carolina and exported to Britain before the American Civil War. Thus the term Carolina rice is also sometimes used to denote this variety of rice.

An external pancreatic fistula is one that communicates with the skin, and is also known as a pancreaticocutaneous fistula, whereas an internal pancreatic fistula communicates with other internal organs or spaces. Pancreatic fistulas can be caused by pancreatic disease, trauma, or surgery. Signs and symptoms Marked recent weight loss is a major clinical manifestation, and unresponsiveness of the ascites to diuretics is an additional diagnostic clue. Pathogenesis Internal pancreatic fistulas are most commonly caused by disruption of the pancreatic duct due to chronic pancreatitis. The chronic pancreatitis is usually alcoholic in origin in adults, and traumatic in origin in children. They may also be caused by leakage from a pancreatic pseudocyst. Anterior disruption of a pseudocyst or a pancreatic duct leads to leakage of pancreatic secretions into the free peritoneal cavity, leading to pancreatic ascites. If the duct is disrupted posteriorly, the secretions leak through the retroperitoneum into the mediastinum via the aortic or esophageal hiatus. Once in the mediastinum, the secretions can either be contained in a mediastinal pseudocyst, lead to enzymatic mediastinitis, or, more commonly, leak through the pleura to enter the chest and form a chronic pancreatic pleural effusion. Diagnosis Pleural or ascitic fluid should be sent for analysis. An elevated amylase level, usually > 1,000 IU/L, with protein levels over 3.0 g/dL is diagnostic. Serum amylase is often elevated as well, due to enzyme diffusion across the peritoneal or pleural surface. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) may also assist in diagnosis, with the latter an essential component of treatment. =Types=External An external pancreatic fistula is an abnormal communication between the pancreas (actually pancreatic duct) and the exterior of the body via the abdominal wall. Loss of bicarbonate-rich pancreatic fluid via a pancreatic fistula can result in a hyperchloraemic or normal anion gap metabolic acidosis. Loss of a small volume of fluid will not cause a problem but an acidosis is common if the volume of pancreatic fluid lost from the body is large. Internal First described by Smith (1953), and elaborated upon by Cameron et al. (1976), internal pancreatic fistulas can result in pancreatic ascites, mediastinital pseudocysts, enzymatic mediastinitis, or pancreatic pleural effusions, depending on the flow of pancreatic secretions from a disrupted pancreatic duct or leakage from a pseudocyst. Treatment The production of pancreatic enzymes is suppressed by restricting the patient's oral intake of food patient in conjunction with the use of long- acting somatostatin analogues. The patient's nutrition is maintained by total parenteral nutrition. This treatment is continued for 2‚Äì3 weeks, and the patient is observed for improvement. If no improvement is seen, the patient may receive endoscopic or surgical treatment. If surgical treatment is followed, an ERCP is needed to identify the site of the leak. Fistulectomy is done in which the involved part of the pancreas is also removed.

The C√¥te de Nuits () is a French wine region located in the northern part of the C√¥te d'Or, the limestone ridge that is at the heart of the Burgundy wine region. It extends from Dijon to just south of Nuits-Saint-Georges, which gives its name to the district and is the regional center. Though some white and ros√© wines are produced in the region, the C√¥te de Nuits is most famous for reds made from pinot noir. The C√¥te de Nuits covers fourteen communes. Six produce grand cru wines, in the central district between Gevrey-Chambertin and Nuits-Saint- Georges, with four lesser villages either side. The Grand Crus of the Cote de Nuits are some of the smallest appellations in France, less than a hectare in the case of La Roman√©e.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 112-150, 206-207, 247-272, 312-313, 429-487, 758-759 Oxford University Press 2006 J. Robinson Jancis Robinson's Wine Course Third Edition pg 165-168 Abbeville Press 2003 Among the northern villages of the C√¥te de Nuits there are several distinct terroir. Uniquely in Burgundy, Marsannay-la- C√¥te produces wine of all three colors - red and ros√© from Pinot Noir, white from Chardonnay. The of the Marsannay appellation extends into Couchey and Ch√™nove. The village of Fixin has its own appellation, but the area of Brochon C√¥te de Nuits Villages extends into the commune with of premier cru vineyards out of of Pinot Noir and of Chardonnay. The village of Gevrey-Chambertin has more Grand Crus than any other village, with nine. Chambertin and its extension Chambertin-Clos de Beze are widely recognized for the quality of their red Burgundy. The other Grand Crus are Mazis-Chambertin, Chapelle- Chambertin, Charmes-Chambertin, Mazoyeres-Chambertin, Griotte-Chambertin, Latricieres-Chambertin and Ruchottes-Chambertin. Morey-Saint-Denis is a small commune with four Grand Crus: Clos de la Roche, Clos St. Denis, Clos des Lambrays and Clos de Tart.H. Johnson & J. Robinson The World Atlas of Wine pg 54-67 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 2005 K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pg 187-206 Workman Publishing 2001 Also among the northern villages, the vineyard soils of Chambolle are particularly chalky, giving the wines a lighter body and finer edge of aromas that complements the usual C√¥te de Nuits backbone of flavor notes. A little white wine is also made in this area. Wines labelled with Chambolle Premier Cru are usually a blend of some of the 19 individual vineyard Premier Crus, of which only Les Amoureuses and Les Charmes are commonly seen. The Grand Crus are Bonnes Mares (which spills over into Morey- Saint-Denis) and Musigny. The village of Vougeot has just one Grand Cru vineyard - Clos Vougeot - that is massive by Burgundy standards, and produces three times as much wine as the rest of the commune. But the variation in terroir over its , and the different winemaking styles of its 75+ owners, mean that wines labeled with the vineyard name Clos Vougeot show as much variation as the wines from entire communes elsewhere. The village of Flagey is best known for its Grand Crus of Grands Ech√©zeaux and Ech√©zeaux; its Premier Crus are sold under the label of Vosne-Roman√©e. Vosne contains some of the most famous names in the wine world, notably Roman√©e-Conti and La T√¢che, two monopoles of the Domaine de la Roman√©e-Conti. The other Grand Crus are Richebourg, La Roman√©e (the smallest AOC in France, at 2 acres/0.84 hectares), Roman√©e-St. Vivant and La Grand Rue.A. Domine (ed) Wine pg 180-193 Ullmann Publishing 2008 E.

The local wines are most of 'Villages' quality, and need longer aging in the cellar than most Burgundies of similar quality. Wines from Premeaux- Prissey are sold under the Nuits-Saint-Georges appellation and as C√¥te de Nuits Villages. Comblanchien gives its name to the seam of limestone in the middle of the C√¥te d'Or.

Stevenson \\"The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia\\" pg 135-150 Dorling Kindersley 2005 A. Bespaloff Complete Guide to Wine pg 65-78 Penguin Books 1994 History The Burgundian kingdom (light green) included the Cote de Nuit in the 5th century AD. The early history of the C√¥te de Nuits is wrapped up in the history of the greater Cote d'Or. The Romans were the first to introduce viticulture into the area during their settlement of Gaul sometime during the 3rd century AD. Breaking away from the typical Roman style of planting near rivers, the Romans encouraged their allies in the area, the Aedui to plant vines on the narrow strip of land that was located to the east of their settlement at Augustodunum. It was this area, known asPagus Arebrignus, that was to eventually be subdivided into the C√¥te de Nuits and C√¥te de Beaune. When the area was under attack from the Alamans and other Germanic tribes, the Romans sought the help of a Baltic tribe known as the Burgundians who would eventually settle into the area and give the region its name.H. Johnson Vintage: The Story of Wine pg 91-121, 267-274, 371 Simon and Schuster 1989 In 312 AD, Emperor Constantine visited the region, where his orator described the difficulties of cultivating vines there. While the quality of the wine was the envy of the empire, the emperor was told, the vines can only be planted on a narrow patch of land between marshy plains and infertile rocky hilltops, where winter frost would often devastate the crops. Taking the wine down from the c√¥te in fragile wooden barrels was a treacherous ordeal along pothole-filled roads, with many barrels being broken and lost along the way. The orator also described a scene of tangled old vines and knotted roots dotted along the vineyard, a likely sign that the ancient Burgundians practiced the vine propagation method of provignage or layering. By the Middle Ages, the Benedictines and Cistercians would come to be the dominating force. The Dukes of Burgundy and Valois, through their political influence and patronage of the church, would do much to spread the renown of the area for its unique and distinctive wines. As early as the 15th century, the vineyards of Chambertain and Nuits were gaining reputations apart from the greater Burgundy region. It was, in these early years, that the developing concept of terroir-of a uniqueness tied into the land-began to be associated with the area. The 17th century saw more vineyards come under the control of the bourgeoisie as the church landholders began selling their lands to the wealthy from the nearby city of Dijon. In 1631, the Abbey of St-Vivant sold their holdings in the villages of Vosne-Roman√©e. The vineyard of Clos de Beze was sold by the Cathedral at Langres in 1651. Then in 1662, the Cistercians sold off all their vineyard holdings near the town of Fixin. =The 18th century and changing winemaking styles= When Louis XIV's personal physician, Guy-Crescent Fagon (pictured) recommended that the king only drink the wines from the Nuits St-Georges, merchants from the Cote de Nuits used the royal association as a marketing tool for the area's wine. During the reign of King Louis XIV, his personal physician Guy-Crescent Fagon recommended that he drink only wines from Nuits St-Georges for their health giving properties.D. & P. Kladstrup Champagne pg 32 Harper Collins Publisher Pieroth Japan \\"Pieroth Newsletter\\" Issue 11, August 2006 Wine merchants in the C√¥te de Nuits latched onto this royal association as a great marketing coup over the region's rivals in Champagne and Bordeaux. The 18th century ushered in a period of t√™te de cuv√©e of wines made solely from the best grapes produced in single vineyards. To add to the distinctiveness of these wines, new winemaking techniques such as extended maceration and longer fermentations became popular. This produced dark, tannic vin de garde wines that required extended periods of aging. Imitation of this style by producers using lower quality of grapes saw producers use various methods of adulteration such as adding honey to the wine in order to increase the sugar and, consequently, the alcohol level of the wine. Following Jean-Antoine Chaptal's, Napoleon's Minister of the Interior, recommendation to use the method now known as chaptalization to boost alcohol levels, the market was flooded with Burgundy wines from the C√¥te de Nuits and beyond that were dark, dense and highly alcoholic. Some of the winemakers producing those hard, dense wines would use some of small segments of white grapes grown in the C√¥te de Nuits as a softening blend in a manner similar to how white grapes were historically used in Chianti. While for most of its history, the C√¥te de Nuits had been firmly associated with red grape varieties, the 16th and 17th century saw an increase in plantings of white grape varieties, like Chardonnay and Fromenteau. White grapes continue to be found scattered throughout the area, including a notable white Chambertain, until the mid 19th century when nearly all premier and Grand cru vineyards became completely dedicated to pinot noir. =Classification of terroir= Following the success of the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855 at the Paris Exposition Universelle, the Comit√© d'Agriculture de Beaune tasked Dr. Jules Lavalle with coming up with a similar classification of the vineyards of the C√¥te de Nuits and C√¥te de Beaune for the 1862 International Exhibition in London. The history of the t√™te de cuv√©e and making wine from a single vineyard estate was more established in the C√¥te de Nuits than C√¥te de Beaune which was reflected in Lavalle's defining over 20 vineyards in the C√¥te de Nuits worthy of cru for red wines while the C√¥te de Beaune had only one exceptional vineyard. Lavalle's classification would serve as foundation for the official establishment of Grand cru and premier cru in the 1930s as Appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e or AOCs. Today there are 24 Grand cru vineyards in the C√¥te de Nuits clustered around six villages and more than 100 premier cru vineyards throughout the region. Climate and geography Village and vineyards around Vosne-Romanee. Located near the 47th parallel north, the Cote de Nuits is one of the northernmost regions to produce premium quality red wines. However, this northerly location brings with it a lot of vintage variation from year to year. From winter time hail, spring time frost and cool autumns that may bring devastating rains that impede ripening and harvest, the quality of each vintage can be highly variable. The vineyards of the Cote de Nuits are planted on east and southeast facing slopes that receive the most opportune sun exposures with vineyards designated as premier and grand cru almost always planted on this ideal aspect at elevations between 800‚Äì1000 ft (250‚Äì300 m). The area experiences a continental climate during the growing season that is characterized by very cold winters and warm summers. The nearby Sa√¥ne river provides some moderation as does the foothills of the Massif Central on the western flank of the region. Its location puts the wine region at a type of \\"climatic crossroads\\" where it expresses very different weather fronts from very different sources such as the Baltic sea from the north, the Atlantic from the west and the Mediterranean from the south. The confluences of these different weather system also adds to the great variability seen in vintage years. For instance, warm winds coming from the south can bring much need heat but can also bring the threat of torrential thunderstorms and hail, especially when those winds swing towards the west and meet up with the Atlantic influences. In the summertime, anticyclonic conditions are present but are usually kept in check by the cooling la bise wind from the north. The term c√¥te in French means hill and for the Cote de Nuits, it describes its geographical placement along the northern expanse of the Cote d'Or escarpment, located just south of the city of Dijon. South of the village of Corgoloin begins the Cote de Beaune region. The region is very narrow ranging from less than a quarter of a mile wide (2/5 of a kilometer) at its narrowest point to about a mile and half (approx 2.4 kilometers) at its widest point. The entire cote is located along a fault line situated between the plains of the Sa√¥ne and the Morvan hills to the west. Within the region, dry valleys known as combes, such as the Combe de Lavaux near Gevery-Chambertain, and tributaries of the Sa√¥ne, such as the Meuzin river near Nuits-St-Georges and the Vouge near the town of Vougeot, break up the escarpment and create patches of land with different aspects and orientations. =Soils= As you travel further up the hillside of the Cote de Nuit, the mixture of soils contain a higher proportion of the light color and well draining limestone that are very favorable for growing wine grapes. Like most of Burgundy, the vineyard soils of the Cote de Nuits is extremely varied. Even areas on the same hillside or only separated by a single dirt path can have dramatically different soil compositions. The Burgundian attribute this diversity of soils to the terroir of the region and as partial explanation for how a pinot noir wine made near the village of Gevrey-Chambertin can taste so different from a pinot noir made in the adjoining village of Morey-St-Denis. Despite these differences, there are some broad generalizations that can be made. Most vineyards contain a base soil of limestone with marl (a clay and limestone mixture) that often includes a mixture of gravel and sand. Historically Burgundian wine growers would uses the proportion of limestone to marl as a guide for what type of grape varieties would be most suited to the area. If the area had a high concentration of marl, pinot noir was planted while Chardonnay would grow in vineyards dominated by limestone. Most of the vineyard soils in the region date back to the Jurassic period of 195-135 million BC when the entire Burgundy region was part of a large inland sea. This left a foundation of predominately limestone made from the skeletal fragments of the marine life that once roamed this sea. The marlstone of the region is made up of the marl, clay, sand and gravel fragments that came from the weathering of old mountain chains in the area such as the Ardennes. The flow of streams and tributaries of the Sa√¥ne contributes to the diversity of the vineyard soils by depositing alluvial sediments from their paths. The soils closest to the plains of the Sa√¥ne are too fertile, with patches of poorly drained soils, that make growing quality wine grapes difficult. As you move upwards along the cote escarpment the soil becomes progressively less fertile with higher proportions of the well-draining and highly porous oolitic limestone and less clay. At this elevation of around 800 ft (250 m) most of the premier cru vineyards start to be found with areas of particularly favored location being designated as grand cru. The band of suitable soils for viticulture is narrow because too far up the hills (beyond 1000 ft/300 m) the top soil becomes too thin to support vines. Viticulture Vineyards in the C√¥te de Nuits have very high vine density, usually more than twice the vines planted in the same area as what would be found in New World wine regions. Like most French wine regions, viticulture in the Cote de Nuits is dictated by tradition and AOC regulations. This can be seen in the high density planting of 4,000 vines per acre (10,000 vines per ha). This in contrast to other pinot noir producing regions, such as Oregon and the Russian River Valley in Sonoma that rarely have vine density exceed 2,000 vines per acre. Most of the vines are trained under the Guyot system, though there has been some experimentation with the Cordon de Royat system to help temper the vigor of some over productive rootstock. The close plantings and tradition usually mandates manual harvesting of the grapes, especially for the premier and grand cru vineyards. Under AOC regulations, harvest yields for pinot noir are limited to 40 hl/ha (2.3 tons per acre) for premier cru and village level wines and 35 hl/ha for grand cru. However, in what are deemed to be \\"exceptional years\\" that warrant larger harvests, growers can seek an exception to the yield maximum with an official plafond limite de classement or PLC from AOC authorities that will allow a 20-30% increase in maximum yields for the year. =Grape varieties= The two primary grapes of the Cote de Nuits, pinot noir and Chardonnay, are believed to be indigenous to the Burgundy wine region. Through centuries of trial and error, the two varieties have shown to produce the most consistent quality in the region. Broadly speaking, pinot noir tends to be planted in areas with high proportion of marl while Chardonnay is most often found in vineyards that are dominated by limestone. As the Cote de Nuits has many areas with significant amounts of marl, pinot noir is the dominant planting in the area. As a grape variety, pinot noir is very reflective of the terroir it is grown in which, coupled with the highly variable soils of the area, can cause two Cote de Nuits wine producers in the same year and by the same producer to be dramatically different due to where exactly they were grown. Winemaking Among the many winemaking decisions that Cote de Nuits producers must make is the length of time that the crushed grape skins spent macerating with the juice and whether or not to include stems during this period. Unlike other wine regions of France (such as Bordeaux), winemaking in the Cote de Nuits exist on a very small scale. The typical domaine estate produces from 50 to 1,000 cases of wine a year, in contrast to a Bordeaux chateau which often makes more than 20,000 cases annually. Vineyards in the area are highly fragmented, with multiple owners each owning pieces of a family. A producer may own only 2 to 3 rows of vines in a vineyard which they could either produce as a separate wine or blend with the production of other similarly small holdings in other vineyards in the region. These blended wines will generally take on a larger scale designation of a village or district-level wines. Those producers who keep the production separate and unblended (such as for a Grand cru or Premier cru level wine) will make several batches of very small quantities of wine that can fetch high prices due to demand for their limited supply. A third option is to sell the grapes or wine to a negociant who may be able to purchase similar lots from the same vineyard to produce more cases of that Grand cru or Premier cru level wine. Despite being made primarily from the same grape, pinot noir, winemaking styles in the Cote de Nuits is far from monolithic. The individual style of the producer or negociant and the decisions they make at each step of the winemaking process ‚Äî beginning with the sorting table as they grapes arrive from the harvest ‚Äî will affect the resulting quality of the wine immensely. It is this reason, along with the varied and complex ownership of most grand and premier cru vineyards, that most wine experts put more weight on the reputation of the producer and the vintage year than on the vineyard name when it comes to evaluating all Burgundy wine-the Cote de Nuits not excluded. Among the winemaking decisions where a producer's style can come through is the decision of whether or not to destem the grapes prior to crushing and fermentation. The presence of stems provide channels for the juice to percolate through the mass of grape skins that will form the cap during fermentation. This cap needs to be managed well and kept in constant contact with the juice in order to extract the color and phenolic compounds that will affect the flavor and aroma of the wine. While stems can help with this cap management, they also provide an additional source of tannins that may be extracted into the wine. The degree of tannin extraction desired will be up to the winemaker with some tannins adding to the mouthfeel and aging potential of the wine while too much can make the wine seem harsh, bitter and out of the balance. The length of maceration, whether or not the wine stays in contact with its skin throughout the entire fermentation period, as well as the temperature that the wine is kept at throughout that fermentation will have an influence on the extraction of the color, tannins and phenols. The temperature of fermentation will also affect the volatilizing of the compounds that contribute to the aroma of the wine. After fermentation, the oak barrel aging regiment will vary with the length of time and proportion of new oak barrels that are used. Most Cote de Nuit producers prefer to age their red wines for at least a year to 18 months and blend lots between barrels of different ages. The traditional barrel used in Burgundy holds 228 liters which is slightly larger than the 225 liters that a traditional Bordeaux wine barrel holds. Prior to bottling, the producer will decide on what, if any fining and filtration methods will be used in the clarification and stabilization of the wine. Some producers will use both, others will fine and not filter and a few will choose to use neither, believing that they can reduce the complexity of the wine even though the wine may have a higher risk of spoilage and instability. Villages Vineyards around the village of Fixin.

Appellation labeling laws Wine from the Gevrey-Chambertin region of the Cote de Nuits. Wine produced in the Cote de Nuits can fall under several Appellation d'Origine Contr√¥l√©e (AOC) depending on where the grapes were grown and whether they were blended with grapes from other areas. All wines produced in the Cote de Nuits is entitled to the basic AOC Bourgogne designation for either its blanc Chardonnay wines or it rouge pinot noir. A higher quality AOC is the C√¥te de Nuits Villages, a general appellation for wines from five of the smaller communes : Fixin and Brochon in the north, Comblanchien, Corgoloin and Prissey to the south. The Hautes-C√¥tes de Nuits are a separate appellation for the hills to the west of Nuits-St-Georges. Individual 'village' appellations are the next step up, although not all match the commune boundaries or names. Notably in the north the Marsannay appellation covers Marsannay-la-C√¥te and parts of Couchey and Ch√™nove. The Premiers Crus are the next level and roughly correspond to individual vineyards that weren't deemed good enough for Grand Cru status.P.

It is the council seat for the Shire of Gingin local government area. Gingin had a population of 852 at the , but the shire as a whole had 5,217 people. The town's economy is mostly based on agriculture, although there has been an increasing focus on science with the establishment of the Australian International Gravitational Observatory and Gravity Discovery Centre. There is also a small military airfield, RAAF Gingin, located nearby. History The first European to visit the area was the explorer George Fletcher Moore; he arrived in 1836 and recorded the Aboriginal name \\"Jinjin\\" on his charts. The first property to be established in the area by William Locke Brockman in 1841 was named Gingin station. The meaning of the word Gingin is uncertain but is thought to mean \\"footprint\\" or \\"place of many streams\\". A townsite, Granville, was established close-by in 1839 but once Gingin was gazetted in 1871 Granville was never developed. By 1853 an area along Gingin Brook was fenced for horses to rest on the way from Perth to Geraldton and a police station was built nearby. Construction of the telegraph line between Gingin and Perth was completed in 1886, and the railway line was completed in 1891. Gingin was declared a town in 1883. Economy The town is well suited for agriculture with a mild climate and available water sources. The area supports many forms of farming including beef cattle, cereal crops, olives, oranges and mangoes. In 2003, plans were unveiled to construct the Gravity Discovery Centre near Gingin adjacent to the existing Australian International Gravitational Observatory. A.I.G.O. is part of a worldwide array of observatories, completing the southern arm of the array to obtain three-dimensional measurements of gravitational waves. The public arm of A.I.G.O. - The Gravity Discovery Centre includes a 45 m tower that leans at an angle of 15 degrees that allows students to complete free fall experiments. In 2006 the Zadko telescope, a robotic optical telescope, was installed into the 'Zadko Dome' near the Gravitational Observatory. The Zadko telescope is used for research on a worldwide scale, scanning the sky for potentially hazardous asteroids, and can be accessed remotely via the internet. It is a joint resource for the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research. It is an equatorial fork-mounted Cassegrain reflector telescope with a primary mirror aperture of 1.007 m and a focal length of 4.0386 m. The telescope's optical design is a hybrid Ritchey‚ÄìChr√©tien. Gingin is host to the annual British Car Day, held on the third Sunday of May. Gingin's Australian rules football club plays in the Mortlock Football League.

He was also a professional still and motion picture photographer and a master chef. Korvin was born in Piestany, Hungary, and studied at the Sorbonne. During his 10 years in France, he was hired by Yvon, the famous French postcard company, shooting on location all over the country. In 1937, he was hired for a CBC documentary film project about the renowned Canadian medical doctor, Norman Bethune. Entitled ‚ÄúHeart of Spain‚Äù, Korvin photographed and co-directed the anti-Franco film which was shot on the front lines during the Spanish Civil War. Moving to the United States in 1940, Korvin studied acting and stagecraft at the Barter Theater in Abingdon, Virginia. As G√©za Korvin, he made his Broadway stage debut in 1943, playing a Russian nobleman in the play, Dark Eyes. After signing a movie contract with Universal Pictures, he changed his stage name to Charles Korvin. He worked steadily through the 1940s, including appearing in three films with actress Merle Oberon. He was blacklisted around 1952, refused to testify before the HUAC, and his film career was halted. Turning to the newly burgeoning, and much less political, field of broadcast television, Korvin starred in early productions for Playhouse 90, Studio One, and US Steel Hour. He played The Eagle for six contiguous episodes on Disney's Zorro and played Latin dance instructor Carlos on The Honeymooners episode \\"Mama Loves Mambo.\\" In 1960, he starred as Inspector Duval in the UK/US television series Interpol Calling produced by J. Arthur Rank. During these years, Korvin returned to off-Broadway theater starring as the king in Rodgers and Hammerstein's The King and I with runs at the Westbury Music Fair and the St. Louis Municipal Opera. He was back on Broadway in the mid-1960s starring as the upstairs neighbor in Neil Simon‚Äôs Tony Award winning play, ‚ÄúBarefoot in the Park‚Äù. In 1964, he returned to Hollywood to play the ship‚Äôs captain in Stanley Kramer‚Äôs Academy Award winning film, Ship of Fools. Remaining active in later years, he was the voice of the Red Baron for eight years on television and radio ads for Lufthansa Airlines. Personal life Korvin and his wife, Natasha, had a daughter, Katherine Pers, and a son, Edward Danziger Korvin. For more than 25 years, Korvin, with his wife Anne, were part-of-the-year residents in Klosters, Switzerland, where he enjoyed skiing, cooking and entertaining with friends and fellow part time residents Irwin and Marion Shaw, Greta Garbo, Salka Viertel, Deborah Kerr, Robert Ricci, John Fairchild and Gaetan de Rosnay among others. Korvin claimed to have been Greta Garbo's last dance partner.Lamparski, p. 95. Julia Child, another long time friend, was interviewed in 1978 by Dick Cavett on his PBS television show. When he asked her to name her favorite ‚Äúamateur‚Äù chef, Child replied, ‚ÄúCharles Korvin‚Äù.

The route was built in the late 1960s, opening between mid-1967 and late 1970. The old routes of Highway 11/17 and Highway 61 through Thunder Bay were redesignated as Highway 11B/17B and Highway 61B. Work is now ongoing to twin Highway 11/17 northeast to Nipigon.  Route description  The Thunder Bay Expressway forms the southernmost portion of the Terry Fox Courage Highway, which continues east to Nipigon along the Trans-Canada Highway. Between Arthur Street and the Harbour Expressway, it shares a designation with Highway 61, while between there and the eastern terminus at Hodder Avenue, it shares a designation with Highway 11 and 17, a portion of the Trans-Canada Highway. The entire route is four lanes and undivided, with an exception between Balsam Street and Hodder Avenue where the route is twinned. Its intersections are all at-grade. Plans to entirely twin the highway and build interchanges were abandoned in the 1990s. The province of Ontario announced funding to twin the Trans-Canada Highway from Thunder Bay to Nipigon, which has resulted in the first, local highway interchange at the intersection of Hodder Avenue, and highways 11 and 17. The highway runs along the western edge of Thunder Bay south and bisects the northwest portion of Thunder Bay north. The bulk of its traffic is local but it is also an important route in the Trans-Canada highway network.  History  In 1963, Charles MacNaughton, minister of the Department of Highways, announced plans for the Lakehead Expressway to be built on the western edge of the twin cities of Port Arthur and Fort William (which amalgamated in 1970 to form Thunder Bay). Work began in August 1965, with a contract for a section of divided highway on the west side of the twin cities. Plans called for a at- grade expressway from South of Arthur Street to meet Highway 11 and Highway 17 northeast of the cities. The first section of the expressway opened on August 29, 1967, connecting Oliver Road (then part of Highway 130) and Golf Links Road with Dawson Road (Highway 102). By mid- to late 1969, the route had been extended to Highway 527 northeast of the twin cities and to Highway 11 and Highway 17 (Arthur Street) at the Harbour Expressway. By late 1970, the route had been extended southward from Arthur Street to Neebing Avenue / Walsh Street West. At this time, Highway 11/17 and Highway 61 were rerouted along the completed expressway. The old routes through Thunder Bay were redesignated as Highway 11B/17B and Highway 61B.

It has a grey body. The top of the neck and head is white, except for a patch of bare red skin above the eye. It is one of the smallest cranes, but is still a fairly large bird, at 1 m (3.3 ft) long, a weight of 3.7 kg (8.2 lbs) and a wingspan of 1.87 m (6.2 ft). The hooded crane breeds in south-central and south-eastern Siberia. Breeding is also suspected to occur in Mongolia. Over 80% of its population winters at Izumi, southern Japan. There are also wintering grounds in South Korea and China. There are about 100 hooded cranes wintering in Chongming Dongtan, Shanghai every year. Dongtan Nature Reserve is the largest natural wintering site in the world. In December 2011, a hooded crane was seen overwintering at the Hiwassee Refuge in southeastern Tennessee, well outside its normal range.Reuters. Rare Asian bird takes \\"wrong turn,\\" lands in Tennessee In February 2012, one was seen at Goose Pond in southern Indiana, and is suspected to be the same bird, which may have migrated to North America by following sandhill cranes. In April, 2020 one was shot by local hunters in Malakand, Pakistan. It was accepted as a valid record as the first confirmed specimen for the Indian Subcontinent. The estimated population of the species is 11,600 individuals.http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=2795 The major threats to its survival are wetland loss and degradation in its wintering grounds in China and South Korea as a result of reclamation for development and dam building. Conservation activities have been taken since 2008. Local universities, NGOs and communities are working together for a better and safer wintering location. The hooded crane is evaluated as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix I and II of CITES.

The September 24 March also included over 300 members of Military Families Speak Out, which represents about 2,500 military families.Military families add weight to criticism of Iraq war, Miriam Raftery, The Raw Story, October 5, 2005  World Bank/IMF feeder march  In addition to the main rally and march sponsored by ANSWER and United for Peace and Justice, the Mobilization for Global Justice sponsored a feeder march to protest the policies of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF), held to coincide with the fall meetings of the World Bank and IMF, which were happening on the same weekend. The feeder march met at Dupont Circle. In addition to more mainstream demonstrators, a large black bloc had gathered. This march from Dupont Circle did not have a march permit from the D.C. government, and as such, details of the actual march route were not disclosed until the last minute. Along with the crowd that had initially gathered, a second feeder march protesting the School of the Americas joined the World Bank/IMF group at Dupont Circle. The Mobilization for Global Justice's feeder march ran from Dupont Circle down Connecticut Avenue and past Farragut Square, reaching Murrow Park and the World Bank. After marching west along H Street as far as 19th Street NW, encountering police barricades on three sides, the march did an about-face and marched east along H Street to Lafayette Square, joining the main march sponsored by ANSWER and UFPJ.  Black bloc breakaway march  Participants in the Black Bloc breakaway march near the World Bank Following the Mobilization for Global Justice's feeder march to the World Bank and then the White House, the Black Bloc began a separate, quite circuitous march through the streets of Washington, headed for the nearest recruitment center. Reaching the recruitment center, police began backfiring their motorcycle engines. A number of demonstrators unfamiliar with the tactic assumed that rubber bullets were being fired, and much of the Black Bloc scattered, seeking cover. With the main bloc reduced to around sixty people, the Black Bloc retreated, with many scattering newspaper boxes and trash receptacles in an attempt to slow police.

It is the first stop east of Norseman on the journey east across the Nullarbor Plain. Between Balladonia and Caiguna is a stretch of the highway which is one of the longest straight stretches of road in the world. History The name is an Aboriginal word meaning \\"big rock by itself\\". The area was settled in 1879 and the original Balladonia homestead was built away from the present townsite. From 1897 to 1929, Balladonia was a station on the Perth-Adelaide telegraph line, due to a previous coastal line being shorted by salt spray from the Southern Ocean. The arid climate and lack of suitable water sources restricted the town's development. In July 1979, the area gained worldwide attention when the re-entry of the Skylab space station left a trail of debris across the nearby countryside. =Present day= The Balladonia roadhouse, a modern air-conditioned facility for travellers, has a display of Skylab debris and newspaper clippings, as well as a pub and motel rooms. Access via four-wheel drive is possible to the start of the cliffs, believed to be the longest in the world, of the Great Australian Bight from Balladonia. Information is available from the roadhouse. There is the ruined shell of a telegraph station just to the east of Balladonia at the start of the \\"Ninety Mile Straight\\". However, it is signposted as being private property. Also in the area are freshwater pools 14 km east at Afghan Rocks, named for a camel driver who was shot by thirsty travellers. Pastoral lease Balladonia Station is a pastoral lease adjacent to Noondoonia Station to the north, and Nanambinia Station to the south of the Eyre Highway. The station was visited and written about in a newspaper in 1924, and the reflections on the conditions at that time included concern about rabbits. The homestead of the station was notable for its substantial size and architecture in the 1930s. An earlier photograph in the 1890s reveals the stone walls in the vicinity of the homestead, and a possible earlier stage of the homestead building. During most of the twentieth century the Station was also a popular stopping place on the Eyre Highway. GeographyClimate= Balladonia experiences a steppe climate (K√∂ppen climate classification BSh).

He played aristocrats or British military types in many films, and created the role of Colonel Hugh Pickering in the long-running original Broadway production of My Fair Lady. Biography Coote was born in London and educated at Hurstpierpoint College in Sussex. He began his stage career at the age of 16, performing in Britain, South Africa, and Australia before arriving in Hollywood in the late 1930s. He played a succession of pompous British types in supporting roles, including a brief but memorable turn as Sgt. Bertie Higginbotham in Gunga Din (1939). His acting career was interrupted by his service as a squadron leader in the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II. He played Bob Trubshawe in Powell and Pressburger's A Matter of Life and Death (1946), chosen for the first-ever Royal Film Performance on 1 November 1946, before he returned to Hollywood, where his films included The Ghost and Mrs. Muir (1947), Forever Amber (1947), The Three Musketeers (1948), and Orson Welles' Othello (1952).Katz, Ephraim, The Film Encyclopedia (1994, second edition ), p. 289 In 1956, Coote created the role of Colonel Pickering in the original Broadway production of My Fair Lady (1956‚Äì62), which he reprised in the musical's 1976‚Äì77 Broadway revival. He also originated the role of King Pellinore in the Broadway production of Camelot (1960‚Äì63). He was nominated for an Emmy Award for his performance as Timmy St. Clair in the NBC TV series The Rogues (1964‚Äì65).

In his last feature film performance, Coote portrayed one of the critics dispatched by Vincent Price in Theatre of Blood (1973). His final role was on television, playing orchid nurse Theodore Horstmann in the 1981 NBC-TV series Nero Wolfe, starring William Conrad in the title role. In most film and TV adaptations of Nero Wolfe mysteries, before and since, Horstmann has been a very minor character, but Coote's Horstmann got considerable screen time in the series.

It was immediately north of the River Thames and east of the River Lea. Area and boundaries The borough included Plaistow, West Ham, Stratford, Canning Town and Silvertown ‚Äì all of the current-day London Borough of Newham west of Green Street. At the time of the 1901 census it was the ninth most populous town or district in England with a population of 267,308.Vision of Britain ‚Äì 1901 Census: Preliminary Report The borough formed part of London's built-up area, was part of the London postal district and the Metropolitan Police District. From 1934 to 1965 it was surrounded by the County Borough of East Ham to the east, the municipal boroughs of Wanstead and Woodford and Leyton to the north, and the metropolitan boroughs of Poplar to the west and Greenwich to the south. Predecessors West Ham underwent rapid growth from 1844 following the Metropolitan Building Act. The Act restricted dangerous and noxious industries from operating in the metropolitan area, the eastern boundary of which was the River Lea. Consequently, many of these activities were relocated to the other side of the river and to West Ham, then a parish in Essex centred on All Saints Church, West Ham. As a result, West Ham became one of Victorian Britain's major manufacturing centres for pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and processed foods. This rapid growth earned it the name \\"London over the border\\". The growth of the town was summarised by The Times in 1886: > \\"Factory after factory was erected on the marshy wastes of Stratford and > Plaistow, and it only required the construction at Canning Town of the > Victoria and Albert Docks to make the once desolate parish of West Ham a > manufacturing and commercial centre of the first importance and to bring > upon it a teeming and an industrious population.\\" Many workers lived in slum conditions close to where they worked, leading to periodic outbreaks of contagious diseases and severe poverty. It had become apparent that local government in the parish of West Ham was not adequate to meet the needs of the area which was divided between the parish vestry, highway board and the Havering and Dagenham Commissioners of Sewers. Problems centred on provision of adequate paving, water supply, fire fighting and control of development. In 1853 a group of ratepayers initiated moves to improve local administration. This led to a public enquiry by Charles Dickens' brother Alfred, a medical officer, who published a report in 1855 severely critical of conditions in the slum areas. Accordingly, the Public Health Act 1848 was applied to the parish, and a local board of health was formed in 1856. The board had 15 members: 12 elected and 3 nominated by the Commissioners of Sewers. Incorporation A map showing the wards of West Ham Civil Parish as they appeared in 1867. In November 1878 the inhabitants of the parish decided to petition the privy council for a charter, incorporating the town as a municipal borough. This was in reaction to proposals to enlarge the area governed by the Metropolitan Board of Works to include adjoining districts with a population of 50,000 or more: the primary aim of incorporation was to prevent the inclusion of West Ham in an enlarged London municipality. This initial application was unsuccessful. However, encouraged by the 1883 incorporation of Croydon, a second petition was submitted in May 1885. Following an inquiry in October 1885, a scheme for the creation of the borough and dissolution of the board of health was made in June and the charter was granted in July 1886. A corporation consisting of a mayor, 12 aldermen and 36 councillors replaced the board, with the first elections held on 1 November. The first mayor was John Meeson, head of a local lime burning and cement making firm, and a former chairman of West Ham Local Board. The first female mayor was Daisy Parsons in 1937.Tim Wales, ‚ÄòParsons , Marguerite Lena (1890‚Äì1957)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 21 Nov 2017 County borough The Local Government Act 1888 created elected county councils to administer services throughout England and Wales. Where a municipal borough had a population of more than 50,000 at the 1881 Census it was created a county borough, with the powers and duties of both a borough and county council. As West Ham had an 1881 population of 128,953 it duly became a county borough on 1 April 1889. The borough, while independent of Essex County Council for local government, remained part of the county for purposes such as the administration of justice and lieutenancy.Local Government Act 1888 (32 & 33 Vict. c.49) s.31 \\"Each of the boroughs named in the Third Schedule to this Act being a borough which on the first day of June one thousand eight hundred and eighty-eight, either had a population of not less than fifty thousand, or was a county of itself shall, from and after the appointed day, be for the purposes of this Act an administrative county of itself, and is in this Act referred to as a county borough. Provided that for all other purposes a county borough shall continue to be part of the county (if any) in which it is situate at the passing of this Act\\" Utilities The borough acquired the horse-drawn tram services in its area in 1898, electrified them in 1904, and extended the network. There was also through running of the corporation trams and those of the London County Council system. West Ham Corporation Tramways operated 134 tram cars on of tracks when they became the responsibility of the London Passenger Transport Board in 1933.London's Trams and Trolleybuses, John R Day, published by London Transport, 1979 The borough ran its own fire brigade which was absorbed into the London Fire Brigade in 1965. The corporation's electricity generation and supply undertaking was nationalised in 1948, when it was transferred to the London Electricity Board. Following the passing of the Local Government Act 1929 the Council took over responsibility for certain health services, such as the large Whipps Cross Hospital in neighbouring Leyton (now the Whipps Cross University Hospital) which they developed until it passed into the new National Health Service in 1946.Victoria County History of Essex; Vol 4: OUP; 1973: p214 Borough council thumb* Top row: Councillors W Crow, T Knight, T Anderson, A Govier, J H Pavitt, W Lewis, C Mansfield, H Wagstaff, J Cook * Second row:Councillors H Young, J Maw(?)

Each ward returned nine councillors, with three councillors elected in each ward for a three-year term on 1 November each year.Census of England and Wales, 1891, County of Essex In addition to the 36 directly-elected councillors there were also 12 aldermen, who were elected by the council itself, giving the town council a total membership of 48. In 1899 the wards were redrawn: the borough was divided into 12 wards, each returning 3 councillors. The number of councillors remained at 36. The 1899 wards were as follows: No.1 or New Town, No.2 or Forest Gate, No.3 or High Street, No.4 or Broadway, No.5 or Park, No.6 or Upton, No.7 or West Ham, No.8 or Plaistow, No.9 or Hudsons, No.10 or Canning Town, No.11 or Tidal Basin and No.12 or Custom House & Silvertown.Census of England and Wales, 1901, County of Essex In 1922 the number of wards was increased to sixteen, each represented by three councillors and one alderman. The size of the council was thus increased to sixty-four members. The names of the wards, which continued in use until 1965, were: Beckton Road, Bemersyde, Broadway, Canning Town & Grange, Custom House & Silvertown, Forest Gate, High Street, Hudsons, Newtown, Ordnance, Park, Plaistow, Plashet Road, Tidal Basin, Upton and West Ham. =Politics= The borough was notable for having the first Labour controlled council in England. Following the London Dock Strike of 1889, a number of Socialists and Progressives were elected to the council, formally becoming the Labour Group in 1897. The Group gained a majority on the town council in 1898. In reaction to this, a Municipal Alliance was formed by the West Ham Ratepayers Association and Chamber of Commerce to oppose the Labour Party. In 1900 they gained parity with Labour on the council and in the following year they took control.Municipal Socialism VIII: A Socialist R√©gime in West Ham, The Times, 16 September 1902, p.12 The Municipal Alliance retained power until 1910 when a Labour-Progressive coalition replaced it. Two years later Municipal Alliance councillors regained a narrow majority, which they held at the 1913 election. Elections were suspended for the duration of the First World War, and at the 1919 elections Labour won an overall majority which it retained for the rest of the borough's existence. The Labour majority was to increase over the years, with a small group of Ratepayers Association councillors supported by the Conservative Party forming the opposition group. From 1947 the Conservatives contested elections in their own name, but after 1954 had no councillors elected. From 1954 to 1960 Labour held all the seats on the council, after which a number of Liberal Party councillors formed a minority group. =Coat of arms= The coat of arms was granted by the College of Arms on 14 January 1887. The chevrons on the lower portion represent Stratford, taken from the device of Stratford Langthorne Abbey. At the top right, there are crossed hammers, representing the Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company ‚Äì the borough's main employer. The ship is representative of the Royal Docks, and the area's long association with the sea. The Latin motto \\"Deo Confidimus\\" at the base translates as \\"In God We Trust.\\" Abolition and inclusion in Greater London The omission of West Ham from the London- administered metropolitan area, which took in nearby places such as Greenwich and Woolwich, was first commented on in 1855 and West Ham Council later considered the case for inclusion in the County of London in 1895 and 1907.Local administration and public services: Administrative bodies, A History of the County of Essex: Volume 5 (1966), pp. 32‚Äì37. Date accessed: 7 December 2007. The reluctance to proceed with amalgamation was largely explained by lack of perceived support, fear of financial disadvantage caused by increased rates, the detrimental effect of London planning laws on industry, and the desire to retain the independent civic institutions and privileges attached to county borough status. The Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London reviewed the local government arrangements of the Greater London Conurbation and in 1965 the county borough, and the County Borough of East Ham, were abolished and their former area was amalgamated with small parts of Barking and Woolwich to form the London Borough of Newham in Greater London.

It was known as Barking Town from 1882 to 1931. The district included the town of Barking, eastern Beckton and the southwestern part of the Becontree estate. The district was within the Metropolitan Police District and experienced a steady increase in population during its existence. It now forms the western part of the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham and the eastern extremity of the London Borough of Newham in Greater London. Background The ancient parish of Barking covered an area of in the Becontree hundred. The parish was the largest in Essex in terms of area and was divided into the four wards of Town, Ripple, Great Ilford and Chadwell.'The ancient parish of Barking: Local government and poor relief', A History of the County of Essex: Volume 5, (1966) The Town ward covered land immediately to the east and west of the River Roding and the Ripple ward stretched from Longbridge Road in the north to the River Thames in the south taking in Creekmouth and the western part of the modern estate of Becontree. Chadwell ward was immediately to the northeast including Goodmayes, part of Chadwell Heath and Little Heath. Great Ilford was to the northwest and included the modern areas of Barkingside, Clayhall, Gants Hill, Ilford, Redbridge and Seven Kings. Formation A map showing the wards of Barking Civil Parish as they appeared in 1871. A local board was formed for Town ward in 1882 and was extended to cover Ripple ward in 1885. In 1888 Barking parish was reduced in size, to match the area of the local board, as the Chadwell and Great Ilford wards formed a new parish of Ilford. In 1894 the area of the local board became the Barking Town urban district of Essex, as part of the Local Government Act 1894, and the Ilford parish became the Ilford Urban District. District and borough The district gained the status of municipal borough in 1931 and was renamed Barking. The borough ran its own tram services, Barking Town Urban District Council Light Railways, until they became the responsibility of the London Passenger Transport Board in 1933.Reed, J., London Tramways, (1997) The borough bordered East Ham to the west, Ilford to the north and Dagenham to the east. In the south the borough bordered the River Thames, with the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich in the County of London to the south. There was also a land boundary as the eastern part of the North Woolwich exclave was surrounded by Barking on three sides. The electoral wards used in the Municipal Borough. 1. Abbey 2. Gascoigne 3.

Manor 7: Longbridge 8: Park Abolition Since the building of the Becontree estate in the 1920s across the three districts of Ilford, Barking and Dagenham, there had been periodic discussion and review of the local government arrangements in the area.'The borough of Barking', A History of the County of Essex: Volume 5, (1966) The districts were all considered to form part of the Greater London conurbation and in 1957 formed part of the review area of the Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London. The 1960 report of the commission recommended the union of Barking and Dagenham as a single London borough. Following the review, in 1965 the London Government Act 1963 abolished the municipal boroughs of Barking and Dagenham, and transferred their former area from Essex to Greater London, to form the London Borough of Barking. The section of Barking west of the River Roding around Beckton became part of the London Borough of Newham.

It is the site of a pyramid built by the Pharaoh Amenemhat III in the 19th century BC.  History  Amenemhat III was the last powerful ruler of the 12th Dynasty, and the pyramid he built at Hawara (illustration, right) is believed to post-date the so-called \\"Black Pyramid\\" built by the same ruler at Dahshur. This is believed to have been Amenemhet's final resting place. At Hawara there was also the intact (pyramid) tomb of Neferu-Ptah, daughter of Amenemhet III. This tomb was found about 2 km south of the king's pyramid. In common with the Middle Kingdom pyramids constructed after Amenemhat II, it was built of mudbrick round a core of limestone passages and burial chambers, and faced with limestone. Most of the facing stone was later pillaged for use in other buildings-- a fate common to almost all of Egypt's pyramids-- and today the pyramid is little more than an eroded, vaguely pyramidal mountain of mud brick, and of the once magnificent mortuary temple precinct formerly enclosed by a wall there is little left beyond the foundation bed of compacted sand and chips and shards of limestone. The huge mortuary temple that originally stood adjacent to this pyramid is believed to have formed the basis of the complex of buildings with galleries and courtyards called a \\"labyrinth\\" by Herodotus (see quote at Labyrinth), and mentioned by Strabo and Diodorus Siculus. (There is no historicity to the assertion of Diodorus Siculus that this was the model for the labyrinth of Crete that Greeks imagined housed the Minotaur.) The demolition of the \\"labyrinth\\" may date in part to the reign of Ptolemy II, under whom the Pharaonic city of Shedyt (Greek Crocodilopolis, the modern Medinet el-Fayum) was renamed to honour his sister-wife Arsino√´; a massive Ptolemaic building program at Arsino√´ has been suggested as the ultimate destination of Middle Kingdom limestone columns and blocks removed from Hawara, and now lost. Pharaoh Sobekneferu of the Twelfth Dynasty also built at the complex. Her name meant \\"most beautiful of Sobek\\", the sacred crocodile. left left alt=  Pyramid  From the pyramid entrance a sloping passageway with steps runs down to a small room and a further short horizontal passage. In the roof of this horizontal passage there was a concealed sliding trapdoor weighing 20 tons. If this was found and opened a robber would find himself confronted by an empty passage at a right angle to the passage below, closed by wooden doors, or by a passage parallel to the passage below, carefully filled with mud and stone blocking. He would assume that the blocking concealed the entrance and waste time removing it (thereby increasing the likelihood of detection by the pyramid guardians). In fact there was a second 20-ton trapdoor in the roof of the empty passage, giving onto a second empty passage, also at a right angle to the first. This too had a 20-ton trapdoor giving onto a passage at a right angle to its predecessor (thus the interior of the pyramid was circled by these passages). However this passage ended in a large area of mud and stone blocking that presumably concealed the burial chamber. This, however, was a blind and merely filled a wide but shallow alcove. Two blind shafts in the floor, carefully filled with cut stone blocks, further wasted the robbers' time, for the real entrance to the burial chamber was even more carefully concealed and lay between the blind shafts and opposite the alcove. Despite these elaborate protective measures, Petrie found that none of the trapdoors had been slid into place and the wooden doors were open. Whether this indicated negligence on the part of the burial party, an intention to return and place further burials in the pyramid (when found there were two sarcophagi in the quartzite monolith described below and room for at least two more), or a deliberate action to facilitate robbery of the tomb, we cannot know. The burial chamber was made out of a single quartzite monolith which was lowered into a larger chamber lined with limestone. This monolithic slab weighed an estimated 110 tons according to Petrie. A course of brick was placed on the chamber to raise the ceiling then the chamber was covered with 3 quartzite slabs (estimated weight 45 tons each). Above the burial chamber were 2 relieving chambers. This was topped with 50 ton limestone slabs forming a pointed roof. Then an enormous arch of brick 3 feet thick was built over the pointed roof to support the core of the pyramid.Edwards, Dr. I.E.S.: The Pyramids of Egypt 1986/1947 p. 237-240Siliotti, Alberto, Zahi Hawass, 1997 \\"Guide to the Pyramids of Egypt\\" The entrance to the pyramid is today flooded to a depth of 6 metres as a result of the waters from the Bahr Yusuf (Joseph's) Canal, which flows around two sides of the site and passes within 30m of the pyramid. alt=  Excavations  The first excavations at the site were made by Karl Lepsius, in 1843. William Flinders Petrie excavated at Hawara, in 1888, finding papyri of the 1st and 2nd centuries CE, and, north of the pyramid, a vast necropolis where he found 146 portraits on coffins dating to the Roman period, famous as being among the very few surviving examples of painted portraits from classical antiquity, the \\"Fayum\\" mummy portraits from Roman Egypt. Among the discoveries made by Petrie were papyrus manuscripts, including a great papyrus scroll which contains parts of books 1 and 2 of the Iliad (the \\"Hawara Homer\\" of the Bodleian Library, Oxford).

It is found in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. Its impressive size and colour have made it important in many tribal cultures and rituals. The great hornbill is long-lived, living for nearly 50 years in captivity. It is predominantly frugivorous, but is an opportunist and will prey on small mammals, reptiles and birds. Description The iris, underside of the casque and orbital skin colours vary between the sexes The great hornbill is a large bird, long, with a wingspan and a weight of . The average weight of 7 males was whereas that of 3 females was . It is the heaviest, but not the longest, Asian hornbill (falling second to the similarly weighted helmeted hornbill due to the latter's extremely long tail feathers).Holmes, D. A., & Nash, S. (1990). The birds of Sumatra and Kalimantan. Oxford University Press, USA. Females are smaller than males and have bluish-white instead of red eyes, although the orbital skin is pinkish. Like other hornbills, they have prominent \\"eyelashes\\". The most prominent feature of the hornbill is the bright yellow and black casque on top of its massive bill. The casque appears U-shaped when viewed from the front, and the top is concave, with two ridges along the sides that form points in the front, whence the Latin species epithet bicornis (two-horned). The back of the casque is reddish in females, while the underside of the front and back of the casque is black in males. The casque is hollow and serves no known purpose, although it is believed to be the result of sexual selection. Male hornbills have been known to indulge in aerial casque butting, with birds striking each other in flight. The male spreads the preen gland secretion, which is yellow, onto the primary feathers and bill to give them the bright yellow colour. The commissure of the beak is black and has a serrated edge which becomes worn with age. The wing beats are heavy and the sound produced by birds in flight can be heard from a distance. This sound has been likened to the puffing of a steam locomotive starting up. The flight involves stiff flaps followed by glides with the fingers splayed and upcurled. They sometimes fly at great height over forests. Illustration by English zoological artist T. W. Wood showing the eyelashes, worn bill edge and the concave casque with ridged sides Taxonomy The species was formerly broken into subspecies cavatus, from the Western Ghats, and homrai, the nominate form from the sub- Himalayan forests. The subspecies from Sumatra was sometimes called cristatus. Variation across populations is mainly in size, Himalayan birds being larger than those from further south, and the species is now usually considered monotypic. Like other members of the hornbill family, they have highly pneumatized bones, with hollow air cavities extending to the tips of the wing bones. This anatomical feature was noted by Richard Owen, who dissected a specimen that died at the Zoological Society of London in 1833. Distribution and habitat Great hornbills are found in the forests of India, Bhutan, Nepal, Mainland Southeast Asia, Indonesian Island of Sumatra and North eastern region of India. The distribution of the species is fragmented over its range in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. In the subcontinent they are found in a few forest areas in the Western Ghats and in the forests along the Himalayas. Deforestation has reduced their range in many parts of India such as in the Kolli hills where they were recorded in the 1860s. Their distribution extends into Thailand, Burma, Malaya, and Sumatra. A small feral population is found in Singapore. Their habitat is dense old growth (unlogged) forests in hilly regions. They appear to be dependent on large stretches of forest, unlike many of the smaller hornbills. In Thailand the home range of males was found to be about 3.7 km2 during the breeding season and about 14.7 km2 during the non-breeding season. Behaviour and ecology A male in flight, Western Ghats =Food and feeding= A female great hornbill carries food in her beak to feed the chicks A female great hornbill in Nelliyampathy Great hornbills are usually seen in small parties, with larger groups sometimes aggregating at fruit trees. A congregation of 150 to 200 birds has been recorded in southeastern Bhutan. In the wild, the great hornbill's diet consists mainly of fruit. Figs are particularly important as a food source. Vitex altissima has been noted as another important food source. Great hornbills also forage on lipid-rich fruits of the families Lauraceae and Myristicaceae such as Persea, Alseodaphne and Myristica. They obtain the water that they need entirely from their diet of fruits. They are important dispersers of many forest tree species. They will also eat small mammals, birds, small reptiles and insects. Lion-tailed macaques have been seen to forage alongside these hornbills. They forage along branches, moving along by hopping, looking for insects, nestling birds and small lizards, tearing up bark and examining them. Prey are caught, tossed in the air and swallowed. A rare squirrel, the Travancore flying squirrel (Petinomys fuscocapillus) has been eaten, and Indian scops owl (Otus bakkamoena), jungle owlet (Glaucidium radiatum) and Sri Lanka green pigeon (Treron pompadora) have been taken as prey in the Western Ghats. =Breeding= Male feeding the female at the nest During the breeding season (January to April) great hornbills become very vocal. They make loud duets, beginning with a loud \\"kok\\" given about once a second by the male, to which the female joins in. The pair then calls in unison, turning into a rapid mixture of roars and barks. They prefer mature forests for nesting. Large, tall and old trees, particularly emergents that rise above the canopy, seem to be preferred for nesting. They form monogamous pair bonds and live in small groups of 2-40 individuals. Group courtship displays involving up to 20 birds have been observed. The female hornbill builds a nest in the hollow of a large tree trunk, sealing the opening with a plaster made up mainly of feces. She remains imprisoned there, relying on the male to bring her food, until the chicks are half developed. During this period the female undergoes a complete moult. The young chicks have no feathers and appear very plump. The mother is fed by her mate through a slit in the seal. The clutch consists of one or two eggs, which she incubates for 38‚Äì40 days. The female voids feces through the nest slit, as do the chicks from the age of two weeks. Once the female emerges from the nest, the chicks seal it again. The young birds have no trace of a casque. After the second year the front extremity separates from the culmen, and in the third year it becomes a transverse crescent with the two edges growing outwards and upwards, while the anterior widens to the width of the rear end. Full development takes five years. =Roosting= Roost sites are used regularly and birds arrive punctually at sunset from long distances, following the same routes each day. Several tall trees in the vicinity may be used, the birds choosing the highest branches with little foliage. They jockey for position until late at dusk. When sleeping they draw their neck back and the bill is held upwards at an angle.  In captivity  Very few hornbills are held in captivity, and few of them breed well. Females at the nests are extremely easy to capture, and birds caught in the wild are mostly female. Breeding them in captivity has been notoriously difficult, with fewer than a dozen successful attempts. Their extreme selectivity for mates and their long and strong pair bonds make them difficult to maintain for breeding. In captivity hornbills eat fruits and meat, a healthy diet consisting mostly of fruit and some source of protein. A few have been tamed in captivity but hornbill behavior in captivity is described as highly strung. Captive specimens may bask in the sun with outstretched wings. A captive great hornbill, named Jari, in Jurong Bird Park, Singapore, was fitted with a prosthetic casque manufactured using 3D printing after losing his original casque to cancer.https://www.bbc.com/news/world- asia-45729674 Jari coloured his prosthetic casque yellow using pigment from his tail gland.  Conservation status  Due to habitat loss and hunting in some areas, the great hornbill is evaluated as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. (uplisted from near threatened in 2018). It is listed in Appendix I of CITES. Declines in population have been noted in many areas such as Cambodia. In Southeast Asia, birds are frequently shot at by poachers who mistake the species for the highly sought-after helmeted hornbill. Molecular approaches to the study of their population diversity have been attempted.  In culture  Tribal peoples threaten the great Indian hornbill by hunting it for its various parts. The beaks and head are used in charms and the flesh is believed to be medicinal. Young birds are considered a delicacy. Tribesmen in parts of northeastern India and Borneo use the feathers for head- dresses, and the skulls are often worn as decorations. The Sema Nagas consider the flesh unfit for eating, believing that it produces sores on their feet, as in the bird. When dancing with the feathers of the hornbill, they avoid eating vegetables, as doing so is also believed to produce the same sores on the feet. Among the Zomi, a festival without a hornbill feather is incomplete.Dr. Neihsial, Tualchin, History and Culture of the Zoumi, 1993 Conservation programmes have attempted to provide tribes with feathers from captive hornbills and ceramic casques to substitute for natural ones. The great hornbill is called homrai in Nepal (hence the name of the Himalayan subspecies) and banrao, both meaning \\"king of the forest\\". It is called \\"Vezhaambal\\" in Malayalam.

It is said its death was caused by swallowing a piece of wire, but in the past \\"William\\" had swallowed a lighted cigar without ill effects and I for my part think that the loss of his old friend was the principal cause.\\" ReferencesOther sources * Kannan, R.

It included the settlements of Penge, Anerley and part of Crystal Palace. It was part of the London postal district, Metropolitan Police District and, from 1933, the London Passenger Transport Area. In 1965 the urban district was abolished by the London Government Act 1963 and it became part of Greater London, being combined with other districts to form the London Borough of Bromley. Background Penge was a detached hamlet of the ancient parish of Battersea in the Brixton hundred of Surrey.Vision of Britain - Battersea CP (historic map)British History Online - Battersea with Penge Hamlet Parish in the Metropolis Battersea became part of the area administered by the Metropolitan Board of Works in 1855 and the main part of the parish was grouped into the Wandsworth District, whilst Penge became part of the Lewisham District. It formed part of the London School Board area established in 1870. Penge remained formally part of the parish of Battersea, however it was established in 1859 that the two parts of the parish held separate funds and Penge had distinct local government arrangements. In 1866 it became a separate civil parish in its own right. In 1876 an application was made to the Local Government Board that the Vestries Act 1850 should apply to the parish. This allowed Penge Vestry Hall to be constructed. Removal from the Metropolis Penge formed part of the County of London from 1889. In 1900 the local government arrangements in the County of London were reformed by the London Government Act 1899. Provision was made for Penge to be combined with either the Metropolitan Borough of Camberwell or the Metropolitan Borough of Lewisham in the County of London, to be combined with the County Borough of Croydon, or to form an urban district in the counties of Surrey or Kent. Had it become an urban district in Surrey, the County Borough of Croydon would have made it an exclave of the administrative county, and in the event it was transferred to Kent as an urban district.Vision of Britain - Penge UD (historic map) Parliamentary representation Penge was part of the Dulwich Division of Camberwell from 1885 for election of members of parliament. Penge was part of this constituency for elections to the London County Council in 1889, 1892, 1895 and 1898. Poor law Penge became part of the Croydon Poor Law Union under the New Poor Law, thus it was part of Surrey for poor law and registration purposes and did not form part of the Metropolitan Asylums District established in 1867. Abolition In 1965 the urban district was abolished by the London Government Act 1963 and its former area was transferred to Greater London, to be combined with that of other districts to form the present-day London Borough of Bromley.

Nasser (Arabic: ÿ¨ÿßŸÉ ŸÜÿµÿ±; born 12 December 1947) is a Lebanese Australian American business executive and philanthropist. Known for a management career at Ford Motor Company spanning several decades and continents, from 1999 to 2001 he served as Ford's CEO and president. He subsequently was a partner at One Equity Partners (JPMorgan) and on the board of British Sky Broadcasting. He was Chairman of the Australian mining company BHP Billiton from 2010 to September 2017. On 5 December 2012, Smart Company named Nasser No. 6 on a list of the \\"most powerful people in Australian boardrooms.\\" He currently serves on the boards of 21st Century Fox and Ko√ß Holding. A member of both the National Order of the Cedar in Lebanon and the Order of Australia, Nasser was also awarded the Ellis Island Medal of Honor, which pays homage to contributions made to America by immigrants. Nasser funds several scholarship programs that assist individual students. Early life and education Jacques \\"Jac\\" A. Nasser was born in the city of Amyoun, Lebanon on 27 December 1947. He is the son of a former bus driver and independent businessman, Abdo Nasser, who served with the Australian armed forces in Lebanon during the second world war. page 135 At four years of age Nasser moved with his family to Melbourne, Australia. He attended Northcote High School. He started a number of businesses as a teenager, including a bicycle- making operation and several discotheques, which he promoted in Melbourne with his brother Jamie. Nasser's first professional experience was at Ford of Australia as a student intern. He graduated with a business degree from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in Melbourne in 1968, where he would later be awarded with an honorary doctorate of technology. He speaks four languages: English, Arabic, Spanish and Portuguese. Business careerEarly Ford positions (1968‚Äì1997)= Upon graduating, in 1968 the 20-year- old Nasser joined Ford Motor Company as a financial analyst, working at the head office in Australia. In 1973 he joined Ford's global financial staff and transferred to Ford's North American Truck Operations in the United States. Afterwards, he returned to Australia to work as a manager of product programming and financial analysis, before joining Ford's International Automotive Operations. While with the international division, he helped oversee Asia-Pacific and Latin American operations. While working in Argentina, Nasser was notably kidnapped by political extremists, being returned to the Ford plant two days later. Nasser helped in the negotiations of Ford's South African joint venture program in 1982. The following year, he developed a business and operating plan for Ford's Hermosillo Assembly Plant in Mexico. In 1987 Nasser became the first director and vice president of Autolatina, a joint venture between Ford and Volkswagen in Brazil and Argentina. While remaining in charge of Autolatina, in 1989 he also took charge of Ford Australia, where he had started his career. He remained president and CEO of Ford Australia until 1993, where he picked up the corporate nicknames \\"Jac the Knife\\" for costcutting efforts with Ford's supplier base. He was also dubbed \\"Black Jack\\" for his ability to keep numbers north of red. On 1 January 1993, Nasser was elected chairman of the board of Ford Europe, a role he maintained until 1996. He was promoted to vice president of Ford Motor Company in 1993 as well, becoming Ford's group vice president of product development in 1994. While in his position of Ford's VP, Fortune writes that he developed a reputation for working 18-hour days and regularly interacting with Ford employees via a newsletter. Wrote Fortune about his time as VP, \\"if Ford is a religion, then Nasser is the head preacher.\\" =VP and CEO appointments (1996‚Äì1999)= On 1 November 1996, he began heading Ford Automotive Operations. Nasser was the featured speaker at the 1998 New York International Auto Show (NYIAS). Bloomberg Businessweek described Nasser in late 1998 as a \\"scrappy, hard-nosed cost-cutter who is widely credited with Ford's turnaround.\\" The magazine further opined that since becoming Ford's automotive president in October 1996, \\"the blunt-talking Australian has transformed Ford from struggling with the worst profit margins in the business to scoring record earnings last year - surpassing General Motors. Nasser has slashed over $4 billion in costs in the past 18 months... and this fall he will show a further 10% of Ford's 53,000 salaried staff the door. Nasser also has a flair for car design and has reinvigorated Ford's overseas operations.\\" Fortune in June 1998 described Nasser as \\"heir apparent\\" to Ford CEO Alex Trotman, who was soon to retire. The projected high-profile appointment met with a great deal of attention in the press, and largely positive reactions. Before the role was finalized, Robert A. Lutz of Chrysler categorized Nasser as a \\"brilliant automotive executive and unconventional thinker\\" and opined \\"they'd be crazy not to give him the top job.\\" The president of BMW North America stated Nasser had energy and ideas but had \\"to avoid diluting Ford's brands-but I suspect he understands that.\\" On 1 January 1999, Nasser became president and CEO, as well as a member of the board of directors, of Ford Motor Company in Dearborn, Michigan. At the time Ford was the world's most profitable automaker, with profits of $7.2 billion on sales of $163 billion, so he was given free rein to experiment by the simultaneously appointed chairman Bill Ford. Nasser announced that he would transform Ford, according to The Economist, \\"from a boring old car maker\\" into a \\"consumer- products and services company\\". p. 10 He stated he would work to help Ford surpass GM in US market share, and would also try to make Ford less reliant on pickup truck sales. =Initial changes at Ford (1999)= Nasser promptly instituted a number of changes as CEO, closing plants that were losing money and selling unprofitable operations. He also instituted a new human resources policy mandating that 10 percent of low-performing managers could be subject to termination, arguing that new people and turnover were good for the company. He also instituted a program that gave internet access and home computers to employees. Beyond human resources, Nasser's other focus was brand management, and under Nasser's watch, in 1999 Ford formed Premier Automotive Group (PAG) to expand its market share in the luxury segment. PAG was formed to oversee the business operations of Ford's high-end automotive marques, and it grew to include responsibility for the Lincoln, Mercury, Aston Martin, Jaguar, Land Rover and Volvo brands. To reinvigorate certain brand lines, Nasser brought in car designer J Mays. He also oversaw Ford's 1999 acquisition of Volvo for $6.45 billion, LandRover for $2.8 billion, and helped Ford start an \\"automotive e-business integrated supply chain.\\" He diversified Ford's businesses to include e-commerce, junkyards, auto-repair shops, and car distribution among others. By August 1999, The Economist clarified that Nasser had already acquired the Kwik-Fit exhausts-and-brakes chain in Europe, American scrapyard businesses, the consumer-finance arm of Japan's Mazda, and had \\"even signed a deal to provide drivers with satellite-fed audio and other services for a monthly fee.\\" The Economist pointed out the diversification was an attempt to increase profit margins, as \\"whereas car makers are lucky to scrape operating margins of more than 5% from actually making cars, other businesses such as leasing, renting, insurance, finance and car repair, can all achieve margins of 10-15%.\\" Also, by late 1999 Nasser was working to sell the underperforming in-house parts company, Visteon. Ford of North America began marketing the Ford Focus in October 1999 for the 2000 model year as a surprise Christmas present for Nasser, with some changes from the European version. Ford's profits in 1999 were US$6.5 billion ($A9.94 billion), which Drive.com claims was the largest \\"ever made in the world car industry.\\" =Disputes and Firestone (2000‚Äì2001)= According to CNN, Nasser was \\"point man\\" in the dispute between Ford and Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. over tire safety. After an investigation in early 2000 found that tread separation on Firestone tires had led to fatalities in some Ford Explorers, Nasser appeared on prime-time television to announce a product recall allowing Ford owners to change the affected tires for others. Firestone responded by arguing that Ford Explorers had caused the accidents, not its tires, while Nasser defended the Explorer as one of the safer SUVs on the market. On 6 September 2000, Nasser and Bridgestone executive Masatoshi Ono confronted a US Congressional sub- committee on the recall. Dispute arose in the hearings over whether Ford and Firestone had known about similar problems in the 1970s and 1990s. Nasser again denied that Ford had responsibility in the accidents, with Ono admitting some fault. On 22 May 2001, Bridgestone's CEO wrote to Nasser canceling the 100-year supply relationship between their companies, arguing Ford's tire recall was \\"casting doubt on the quality of Firestone tires.\\"Text of Letter to Ford From Bridgestone - The New York Times (22 May 2001) After numerous class action lawsuits, Firestone ultimately recalled millions of tires later that year,NHTSA Recall Campaign 01T-016 Q4 Vehicle Safety Recall Quarterly Report Information, 25 January 2008 (Amended 26 March 2009) (from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) with Ford Motor using AUS$4.4 billion of its own funds to replace Firestone tires on its vehicles. The scandal helped lead to a sharp dip in Ford's 2001 quarterly share prices. By late 2001, Nasser's efforts to diversify Ford's core business had met with mixed reactions in the press, with analysts at The Economist and CNN arguing that diversification and recent recalls had hampered productivity. Nasser's manager evaluation system had also proved controversial at Ford, with allegations of reverse discrimination. In July 2001, Nasser announced that the system was being changed to \\"allow for more flexibility.\\" Ford settled several lawsuits over the system in late 2001 without admitting liability. In October 2001, the 53-year-old Nasser retired from his position as Ford's CEO. He was succeeded in both positions by William Clay Ford Jr, who as Henry Ford's great-grandson had previously been chairman and president. =Recent positions (2010‚Äìpresent)= In February 2001, Nasser became a member of the International Advisory Council of Allianz Aktiengeselischaft. The following year he became a senior partner at One Equity Partners, the private equity arm of JPMorgan Chase. Nasser was involved in 2006 when One Equity speculated on bidding for Jaguar Cars and Premier Automotive Group. On your marques: former Ford chief Nasser eyes up Jaguar. The Independent, 26 August 2006. He also would serve as chairman of One Equity's Polaroid Corporation subsidiary starting in July 2002, before selling the company in 2005. He remained a One Equity partner until 2014. Nasser was on the board of British Sky Broadcasting from November 2002 to November 2012 and he served on the board of BuyTV.com. In 2004, he began a four-year tenure on the board of directors at Brambles Limited, an Australian logistics company. In June 2006 he was appointed to the board the Australian mining company BHP Billiton, specifically BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc. He was elected as the next chairman of BHP Billiton in March 2010, ending an 18-month search to find a replacement for the retiring Don Argus. The Wall Street Journal claimed that \\"analysts welcomed the appointment,\\" and that Nasser had possibly been selected because BHP was \\"looking for the stability of another long-term chairman.\\" The Australian opined the next day that Nasser was \\"the right guy to lead BHP Billiton in the post-Argus era,\\" writing about his time at Ford that \\"Nasser spent a good 15 years delivering Ford, with some internal reluctance, leadership of the reform agenda in the motor industry...Nasser is one reason why Ford is the one US major not to put its hand out for government money in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis.\\" He officially became chairman of BHP Billiton on 13 March 2010. Over the following years Nasser would help implement a number of policy changes at BHP, including a large demerger and a cap on growth projects. Nasser also focused on maintaining the company's long- term financial goals, working to keep the balance sheet stable during a global downturn in the metals and oil markets, and revising the company's progressive annual dividend policy, which The Australian Financial Review dubbed strategic for the \\"new era.\\" On 5 December 2012, Smart Company named Nasser No. 6 on a list of the \\"most powerful people in Australian boardrooms.\\" At the time, Nasser ranked No. 18 on the Optimice Market Capitalisation Influence Index and at No. 17 on the MCII connectedness index. He became a board member at 21st Century Fox in June 2013. On 2 August 2015, it was confirmed that Nasser had joined the board of Ko√ß Holding a large Turkey-based conglomerate. After the deadly Bento Rodrigues dam disaster in Brazil on 5 November 2015, Nasser announced that BHP would be permitting an external investigation into the incident, with findings to be released publicly. In June 2017, BHP announced that Nasser would be replaced by Ken MacKenzie as chairman effective on 1 September 2017. Honors and philanthropy Nasser was named 'Automobile Industries Man of the Year' in 1999 by the Retail Motor Industry Organization. In 2002 he was named an officer of the National Order of the Cedar, the highest honor in Lebanon. Also that year Nasser was awarded the Order of Australia and a Centenary Medal for \\"his contribution to Australian industry, as an Advisor to Government, and for education in the areas of technology.\\" The National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations (NECO) awarded Nasser the Ellis Island Medal of Honor, which pays homage to contributions made to America by immigrants. Nasser funds several scholarship programs\\"The Jacques Nasser Scholarships,\\" The Jacques Nasser Scholarships, RMIT University that assist individual students, including the Jacques Nasser Scholarship in Entrepreneurship at RMIT University in Melbourne, the Jacques Nasser Scholarship for MBA students at the American University of Beirut, and the Jacques Nasser Scholarship at the INSEAD School of Business. He also has been known to support organizations such as Focus: HOPE, a training center in Detroit. Personal life Nasser and his ex-wife Jennifer, also an Australian, married in 1970 and have four children together.http://people.com/archive/driving-force- vol-54-no-13/http://www.afr.com/brand/afr-magazine/bhp-chairman-jac-nasser- reflects-on-30-years-in-management-20170418-gvmsyz By 2009 Nasser was based primarily out of his home in Michigan, though after becoming chairman of BHP Billiton in 2010 he began spending equal time in Australia, also having properties in New York City, London, and Melbourne. Described as a fan of racing, Nasser has served as a periodic judge at Concours d'Elegance events. He has Australian-American dual citizenship, and is nicknamed \\"Jac\\". He owns a 1961 Lincoln Continental. He has a sister named Betty.

As of 2015, Quiggin opposed Bitcoin, calling it a \\"delusion\\" that would lead to \\"environmental disaster\\" due to the \\"ever- increasing environmental damage from the electricity used in the 'mining' of Bitcoins\\" and that \\"The sooner this collective delusion comes to an end, the better.\\" http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-06/quiggin-bitcoins-are-a-waste- of-energy/6827940 He also proposed that the value of Bitcoin was a refutation of the efficient market hypothesis: \\"The EMH states that the market value of an asset is equal to the best available estimate of the value of the services or income flows it will generate. In the case of a company stock, this is the discounted value of future earnings.

With reference to the pro-nuclear film Pandora's Promise, Quiggin comments that it presents the environmental rationale for nuclear power, but that reviving nuclear power debates is a distraction, and the main problem with the nuclear option is that it is not economically-viable.

He attracted attention of his professors for his talent especially for natural science. In 1606 he became a novice at Jesuits in Brno. After a short time he was called up to Rome to be embodied in the Collegium Romanum. He was a member of this College in the time when Galileo Galilei was in Rome (1611) to state his case in the question of Heliocentric and Ptolemaic systems. The Roman College was then open to the Copernican opinion held by Galileo. After a short career as a Professor of Mathematics in Graz and later in Coimbra, Portugal Kirwitzer leaves with other brothers (among them Nicolas Trigault) for China as a missionary. Their ship San Carlos or Bom Jesus arrived in Goa, India, in October 1618. Only 8 brothers out of 22 survived the journey, among them Johann Adam Schall von Bell aus K√∂ln and Johann Schreck. After some time in Goa he moved on to China and finally to Macau where he died on May 22, 1626 (other sources consider Kyoto /then called Meaco/ as the place of his death). He didn't stop being interested in astronomy, he kept in touch with Johann Adam Schall von Bell, a German Jesuit that was preparing the reform of the Chinese calendar and later became president of the Astronomical Office in Beijing. His observations of comets were published in Observationes cometarum anni 1618 fact√¶ in India Orientali a quibusdam S. J. mathematicis in Sinense regnum navigantibus in Aschaffenburg in 1620. Other works include Literae de Martyrio p. Joannis Bapt. Machadi soc. Jesu, qui anno 1617 in Japonia passus est (1622) and Annuae litterae e Sinis datae Macao 28. Nov. et 27. Oct. 1625.  Heliocentric opinion  The exact opinions of Wenceslas Pantaleon Kirwitzer on the topic of heliocentric system are dubious. He never wrote about it in China. He was considered Copernican by his contemporaries, though. For further reading on this topic: Copernicus in China  Kirwitzer Day  In honour of W.P.

Creation Barnet Local Government District was created on 25 September 1863 under the Local Government Act 1858, and was governed by a local board. The Local Government Act 1894 reconstituted the area as an urban district and the local board was replaced by an elected Barnet Urban District Council.Kelly's Directory of Hertfordshire 1899, p.31 (Historical Directories), accessed January 27, 2008 The urban district was extended in 1905, 1914 and 1935.Frederic A Youngs Jr., Guide to the Local Administrative Units of England, Vol I: Southern England, London ,1979 Civil parishes The district originally consisted of parts of the parishes of Chipping Barnet in Hertfordshire, and Monken Hadley and South Mimms in Middlesex. The Local Government Act 1888 adjusted the county boundaries in 1889, so that the entire district was in Hertfordshire; forming part of a long, thin protrusion into Middlesex surrounded by that county on two sides, to the north and south. The Local Government Act 1894 divided the urban district into three civil parishes: *Chipping Barnet (from the part of Chipping Barnet parish in Barnet UD) *Hadley (from the part of Monken Hadley parish in Barnet UD) *South Mimms Urban (from the part of South Mimms parish in the UD) On 30 September 1896 the parish of South Mimms Urban (and therefore Barnet UD) was enlarged, gaining area previously in the parish of South Mimms (South Mimms Rural District). On 25 June the following year the parish of Chipping Barnet was also enlarged, gaining area previously in the parish of Arkley (Barnet Rural District). In 1905 and 1914 respectively the parishes of Arkley and Totteridge were added, from Barnet Rural District. Rowley parish was added on 1 April 1935, created from area of the parishes of Elstree, Ridge and Shenley that lay east of the A1 in the Barnet Rural District. Abolition In 1965 the urban district was abolished by the London Government Act 1963 and its former area transferred from Hertfordshire to Greater London. Its former area was combined with that of other districts to form the present-day London Borough of Barnet. Politics The urban district was divided into six wards for elections: Arkley East, Arkley West, Barnet North, Barnet South, Totteridge East and Totteridge West. =Urban district councilParliament constituency= For elections to Parliament, the urban district was part of the constituency of: *Mid or St Albans Division of Hertfordshire In 1945 St Albans was divided as an emergency measure because its electorate exceeded 100,000 voters, with the urban district becoming part of the new constituency of: *Barnet Gallery Image:Barnet 1961.pngIn 1961: 1 is Barnet and 2 is East Barnet File:Barnet Civil Parish Map 1863.svgDistrict in 1863.

It formed part of the northern suburbs of London and was within the Metropolitan Police District and London Passenger Transport Area. Its former area now forms part of the London Borough of Barnet. Formation The parish of Finchley had no local government in the modern sense until the nineteenth century. The parish initially resisted adopting the Local Government Act 1858 and forming a local board to govern the town on grounds of cost. However, this meant that the area was grouped with a number of other parishes under the control of Barnet Rural Sanitary Authority in 1873. It was the fear of losing power over local administration to Barnet that was to lead the ratepayers of Finchley to adopt the 1858 legislation. Finchley Local Board was formed in 1878, consisting of twelve members. There was tension between the ratepayers of North Finchley and the wealthier Church End area as those owning more property had more votes under the weighted voting system used. A proposal to merge with the neighbouring Friern Barnet Local Government District in 1881 was not carried out. Urban district Wards of the Finchley Urban District The Local Government Act 1894 redesignated various urban local government areas as urban districts, and replaced local boards with directly elected urban district councils. The tension that had existed in the local board continued among the twelve-member council until the urban district was divided into three wards (East, North and West), each electing four councillors, in 1898. Incorporation Wards of the Finchley Municipal Borough In 1926 consideration was first given to applying for a charter of incorporation to create Finchley a municipal borough. This was in response to fears that the area would be absorbed by the County of London, or lose powers to Middlesex County Council. Application was not made until March 1932, however, when a petition to the privy council was made by the inhabitant householders of the urban district. The petition was successful, and on 5 October 1933, the charter was presented to the Charter Mayor, councillor Vyvyan Wells by the Earl of Athlone. The town council consisted of a mayor, six aldermen and eighteen councillors. Two councillors were elected for each of the three wards annually, and half of the aldermen were elected by the council every three years. The borough council subsequently increased in size in 1950 to twenty- four councillors and eight aldermen, with three councillors and one alderman representing each of eight wards: Glebe, Manor, Moss Hall, St Mary's, St Paul's, The Bishop's, Tudor, and Whetstone. The Finchley Lido was the first element in a Finchley complex which was to include a town hall for which plans were drawn up in 1936 but never realised. =Borough council= The borough council was initially controlled by the Conservative Party. Opposition was provided by a handful of independents and a single Labour Party councillor. There was little or no change in the composition of the council prior to the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, when elections were cancelled. Following the ending of the conflict, elections were again held in 1945, with Independents taking every seat on the council. The Conservatives were able to regain a majority at the 1949 council election. From the enlargement of the council in 1950 to the elections of 1957 the membership was twenty-nine Conservatives and three Labour members. In the latter year Liberals returned to the council, and quickly became the second-largest group on the council. At the final elections to Finchley council in 1963, the Liberals gained a majority of councillors and aldermen, with 19 seats to 13 for the Conservatives. =Coat of arms= Following the successful petition for municipal incorporation, the borough council was granted armorial bearings by the College of Arms by letters patent dated 10 July 1933. The arms were blazoned as follows: > Vert on a Chevron raguly between in chief two Bugle Horns stringed Or and in > base a Mitre Argent garnished Gold a Rose Gules surmounted by another > Argent. > And for a Crest On a Wreath Or and Vert a Finch proper resting the dexter > claw on an Escutcheon Or changed with a Fleur-de-Lys Gules. > Supporters: On the dexter side a Lion and on the sinister side a Stag > proper each gorged with a Collar suspended therefrom a Bugle Horn ensigned > with a Ducal Coronet Or. The arms had a green field, across which was placed a \\"raguly\\" chevron: the rough edges suggesting sawn off branches. Together these represented the oak woods that once covered much of Finchley. The area had been a favourite hunting ground of the Tudor monarchs, indicated by the hunting horns and Tudor Rose. The bishop's mitre recalled that much of Finchley belonged to the Bishops of London. The crest, placed on top of a helm and mantling, was an heraldic pun: a finch supporting a shield bearing a fleur de lis, for Finchley. The dexter supporter was a lion, from the arms of the Countess of Pembroke, from whom the Comptons, lord of the manor were descended. The sinister supporter was a stag, referring back to the ancient forest. Abolition Under the London Government Act 1963, the municipal borough was abolished, with its area merging with the municipal borough of Hendon and the urban districts of Barnet, East Barnet and Friern Barnet to form the London Borough of Barnet on 1 April 1965.

It was succeeded by the London Borough of Barnet in 1965 as one of the smaller of its contributory predecessor districts. It was at the local level governed for nine years by the local board, then by Friern Barnet Urban District Council which operated primarily with separate functions from the County Council, operating occasionally for major planning decisions and major projects together with that body, Middlesex County Council. Layout and two main settlements Friern Barnet parish (and later this District) stretched north north-west from the boundary with Hornsey parish (specifically its Muswell Hill part) and was half as wide as long.A P Baggs, Diane K Bolton, M A Hicks and R B Pugh, 'Friern Barnet: Introduction', in A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 6 ed.

British History Online http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol6/pp6-15 The parish largely formed a counter-projection into the Chipping Barnet (also known as High Barnet or Barnet)-Totteridge projection of Hertfordshire into Middlesex to its north. In the north its land was the gentle, broad east escarpment above the head of the Dollis Brook rather than others which are higher and have several limbs around Barnet. In its south the land is gradually lower and a nascent brook feeds west to east, Bounds Green brook. The parish/district had one main road; it was bisected lengthways by (the) High Road, the main road in the area, today the A1000 and part of the traditional Great North Road from London to Edinburgh. Until the mid 19th century the ancient parish of Friern Barnet, a depopulated medieval village -- the manor house, manor barn, farm and church of which survived, had two tiny developed clusters: Whetstone in the far north and Colney Hatch in the south. Friern Barnet remained its ecclesiastical parish. Its civil form created in the mid 19th century took over the wide-ranging powers of the vestry; in a matter of decades it was largely supplanted by a Local Board on creation of Friern Barnet Urban District and as to some powers by Middlesex County Council. Planned urbanisation In common with most outer London areas, the vast bulk of housing was built after the coming of the railways and in this case mainly between the 1851 construction of New Southgate railway station near Colney Hatch (just within the south-east border) and the outbreak of World War II. A second station followed in 1871 which is a short distance from the north-west corner of the District and which is on the High Barnet branch of the Northern Line: Totteridge & Whetstone tube station. This led to high demand for housing in that area of the District.Clive's Underground Line Guides - Northern Line, Dates The statistics in the panel to the right show the population change, accordingly.

Gold apples stood for traditional fruit-growing and the eagle came from the arms of Nicholas Vansittart, 1st Baron Bexley, one time chancellor of the exchequer.

It included the districts of Kilburn, Harlesden, Neasden, Willesden, Cricklewood, Dollis Hill and Brondesbury. The district was abolished in 1965 and its former area transferred to Greater London, merging with the Borough of Wembley to form the London Borough of Brent. The offices of the local board were established at Dyne Road, Kilburn in 1891. These were later enlarged to become Willesden Town Hall. Following the formation of the London Borough of Brent, administration was transferred to Wembley, and the town hall was demolished in 1972. Politics The urban district council elections were not conducted on party political lines until 1910, when pro-Conservative Moderates gained a majority, with Progressive and Labour councillors forming the opposition. By 1921, Labour was having an increased influence on the council and this led to the formation of an anti-Labour Ratepayers Association, who held power until 1933. From 1933 to abolition in 1965 the borough council was Labour-controlled for all but one year. Coat of arms On incorporation in 1933 the borough council was granted a coat of arms. The blazon was as follows: \\"Gules a Chevron between in dexter chief an Orb ensigned with a Cross-crosslet Or and in sinister chief and two Swords in saltire proper hilts and pomels Or and in base three Lilies in a Pot all within a Bordure also Or charged with eight Pellets and for a Crest Issuant from a Saxon Crown two Wings Or each charged with a Cinquefoil Gules. And for Supporters: On either side a Dragon Azure gorged with a Saxon Crown Or and charged on the shoulder with two Seaxes in saltire proper hilts and pomels Or.\\" The Latin motto was Labore est Orare or To Work is to Pray. Around the chevron in the centre of the shield were symbols representing the history of Willesden. The orb was from the attributed arms of King Athelstan. His granting of the manors of Neasden-cum-Willeseden to the monastery of St Arkenwold is one of the earliest historical references to the area. The crossed swords were taken from the arms of the Diocese of London. This records the fact that the Dean and Chapter of St Paul's Cathedral held the manor of Willesden at the time of the Domesday Book. The pot of lilies are the symbol of the St Mary, patron saint of the ancient parish. The border (or bordure) bore eight black discs or pellets, one for each of the manors into which Anglo-Saxon Willesden was divided. The crest above the arms was composed of two wings from the arms of Richard Bancroft, Archbishop of Canterbury 1604 - 1610. Bancroft's family held the Manor of Mapesbury. The wings were charged with red cinquefoils or five leaved figures. These were taken from the arms of All Souls College, Oxford. The college owned much land in the Willesden area. There does not seem to have been any significance in the choice of supporters, which were two blue dragons. Around the neck of each dragon was a gold Saxon crown, and they bore on the shoulder crossed seaxes or notched swords. These emblems were derived from the arms of Middlesex County Council.W.C.

The area was suburban to London, formed part of the Metropolitan Police District and from 1933 was included in the area of the London Passenger Transport Board. History In 1878 the parish of Beckenham adopted the Local Government Act 1858 and formed a local board of 15 members to govern the area. The Local Government Act 1894 reconstituted the local board's area as an urban district. The urban district was divided into seven wards of Coper's Cope, Eden Park, Kent House, Langley Park, Laurie Park, Manor House and Shortlands. Each ward returned three councillors to Beckenham Urban District Council.Kelly's Directory of Kent 1903, p.48 (Historical Directories), accessed January 31, 2008 A distinctive town hall with a tall clock tower, which was designed by Lanchester, Lucas and Lodge in the Neo- Georgian style, was built in the High Street and completed in 1932. It was demolished in the 1990s. The urban district was extended by a county review order in 1934, taking in parts of Hayes and West Wickham from the abolished Bromley Rural District.Relationships / unit history of Beckenham (Vision of Britain), accessed January 31, 2008 In 1935 the urban district council successfully petitioned for a charter of incorporation, and became a municipal borough. In 1965 the municipal borough was abolished by the London Government Act 1963 and its former area transferred to Greater London from Kent. Its former area was combined with that of other districts to form the present-day London Borough of Bromley. The town hall became surplus to requirements and was demolished in the 1990s. Coat of arms The borough was granted a coat of arms on incorporation. The shield was green, recalling that for most its history Beckenham had been a rural community. Across the centre were two silver waves, for the River Beck. At the top of the shield were two flowering chestnut trees. These represented the trees and flowers of the town's open spaces and parks. At the base of the shield was the white horse of Kent. The crest above the shield was a gold lion from the heraldry of the Cator family. John Cator was lord of the manor from 1773 and developed Beckenham from a village into a town. The lion supported a mitre and pastoral staff. These stood for Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, who received the manor of Beckenham at the time of the Norman Conquest. The supporters were described as gentleman and lady \\"in the costume of the early sixteenth century\\".C W Scott-Giles, Civic Heraldry of England and Wales, 2nd edition, London, 1953 ReferencesExternal links *A Vision of Britain - Beckenham MB Category:History of Kent Category:History of the London Borough of Bromley Category:Districts of England created by the Local Government Act 1894 Category:Districts abolished by the London Government Act 1963 Category:Municipal boroughs of England it:Distretto Municipale di Beckenham ","title":"Municipal Borough of Beckenham"},{"id":"2755814","text":"Orpington was a local government district in north west Kent from 1934 to 1965 around the town of Orpington, England.
