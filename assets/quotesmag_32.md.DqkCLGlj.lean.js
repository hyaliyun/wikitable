This tool for supervising students working on their thesis, also known as \\"thesis rings\\", was developed in the 1990s at Maastricht University (Romme & Nijhuis, 2000).  Overview  Participants in a thesis circle meet regularly to discuss the progress of work on (mostly individual) final projects. Students are in charge of planning and chairing the sessions as well as managing and distributing information (e.g. draft chapters). The professor brings his/her disciplinary expertise and knowledge into the meetings of the thesis circle. An important characteristic of thesis circles is the principle of switching roles: students participating in thesis circles frequently switch between their role as writer of a thesis (final project) and their role as co-supervisor of the other students in the circle (Romme, 1999). Research has demonstrated that role switching is a valuable source of learning between peers (McDougall & Beattie, 1997; Dochy, Segers & Sluijsmans, 1999). This mechanism serves to accelerate and deepen learning on key issues and challenges encountered in doing a final project (Romme & Nijhuis, 2000). In an educational sense, thesis circles are a particular form of collaborative learning, inspired by the sociocratic circular approach as well as Vygotsky's theory of the zone of proximal development. In terms of organizational theory, thesis circles are also inspired by the notion of the Learning Organization (e.g., Mazen, Jones & Sergenian, 2000). Thesis circles appear to have a positive effect on both the quality of the supervision process and the performance of the students involved (Rompa & Romme, 2001; Romme, 2003). For example, a former participant in a thesis circle at Tilburg University observed that \\"the concept of a master thesis circle is an excellent idea to promote feedback among students and thus create a truly collaborative environment\\" (source). Many thesis circles accomplish a culture of reflective (i.e. non-rhetorical) questioning and dialogue (Damen, 2007; Van Seggelen-Damen & Romme, 2014). The supervision style of the professor appears to have a strong impact on whether this culture of reflection comes about: in thesis circles with a coaching rather than instruction oriented supervisor, more reflective questioning and dialogue was observed (Van Seggelen-Damen & Romme, 2014). Furthermore, reflective questioning among participants in thesis circles enhances learning in terms of so-called multi-perspective cognitive outcomes (Suedfeld et al., 1992; Cur≈üeu and Rus, 2005). Moreover, students with a stronger need for cognition (Cacioppo et al., 1996) and more openness to experience (McCrae & Costa Jr., 1997) engage more in reflection (Van Seggelen-Damen & Romme, 2014). Thesis circles have been set up, for example, in Maastricht University, Tilburg University, University of Utrecht, Eindhoven University of Technology, Open University of the Netherlands, University of Twente, Rotterdam School of Management and Fontys University of Applied Sciences.

An upgrade to a 2048-node system, which reached a peak speed of 614 GFLOPS, was completed at the end of September 1996. The CP-PACS was run by the Center for Computational Physics, formed for that purpose. The 1024 processor system of the SR2201 achieved 220.4 GFLOPS on the LINPACK benchmark, which corresponded to 72% of the peak performance.H. Fujii, Y. Yasuda, H. Akashi, Y. Inagami, M. Koga, O.

Early life Baig was born in Lehr Sultanpur Village, Chakwal District, in 1951 to a middle-class family. He graduated from King Edward Medical University (KEMU) with a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (BMBS) in 1974. Two years later, Baig was granted a military commission, and was subsequently inducted into the Army Medical Corps. Baig completed his Master of Surgery (M.S.) degree and received a Doctorate of Ophthalmology from the Army Medical College (AMC). After joining the Pakistan Army, Baig quickly climbed in rank as he excelled at various assignments. In 2003 he was promoted to major general, and made commandant of Army Medical College Rawalpindi (AMCR). Baig is credited for implementing revolutionary changes in the medical services in the Pakistani Armed Forces (PAF), as well as improvements for both Air Force and Navy medical services. In 2006, Baig was awarded the second-highest military award, the Hilal-i-Imtiaz-Military. That same year, he was promoted to Lieutenant General.

The attack killed General Baig, the suicide bomber, and eight civilians, leaving twelve wounded. The assassination occurred a week after Pakistan had held peaceful parliamentary elections. Following the attack, an emergency was declared in the city of Rawalpindi, with civilian and military hospitals being put on high alert. Pakistani authorities stated that General Baig was the highest-ranking army officer to be killed in line of duty since Pakistan became a member of the anti-terror coalition in 2001. Aftermath President Parvez Musharraf and care-taker Prime Minister Muhammad Mian Soomro strongly condemned the attack. Musharraf and Soomro said such heinous acts of violence cannot deter the government from its resolve in its fight against terrorism.

The tower measures 11 meters on each side and 14 meters in height, and consists in four sections, the top one housing the bells. The original design included two of such towers. The church itself has a simple rectangular main fa√ßade with one marble portal, built in 1619.

He was born at Taunton, Somerset. Cricket player As a player, Harris was a lower-order left-handed batsman and a right-arm fast-medium bowler. He made his debut for Somerset in May 1952 aged just 16 years and three months, the youngest cricketer ever to play for the county; he did not take a wicket in his first match but scored 18 out of a ninth wicket partnership of 48 with Bertie Buse. There were two further matches in 1953 before Harris disappeared from first-class cricket for three years on National Service. When his cricket career resumed with five matches in 1957, he made useful runs from the lower order, with a career-highest of 41 in the match against Worcestershire. But he still struggled for wickets in a Somerset side that, unlike the year of the debut, 1952, now had several options in fast and medium-paced bowling with the recruitment of Bill Alley, Ken Palmer, Bryan Lobb, Ken Biddulph and Geoff Lomax. He did not play at all in Somerset's successful season of 1958 but returned for seven games in 1959. These included his best bowling performance, three wickets for 29 runs against Worcestershire. But at the end of the season although his contract had a further year to go Harris retired due to an injury and a job offer as a coach with Framlimgham College, Suffolk. Harris played Minor Counties cricket for Suffolk for four seasons from 1960 to 1963 and then disappeared entirely from representative cricket for a dozen years, reappearing in 1975, again in Minor Counties cricket, this time playing for Devon. Cricket umpire & later years Harris was an umpire in Minor Counties matches involving Devon from 1979 to 1982 and from 1981 he started acting as umpire in a few first-class matches too. In 1983 he was appointed for the regular first-class and List A umpires for English cricket and he remained there, officiating in 288 first- class and 308 List A games, until he retired at the end of the 2000 season. He acted as reserve umpire in one Test match in his final season as an umpire. In his later years, Harris was secretary/chairman of the former Somerset Players Association.

Cultural Research Institute The Bedia, sometimes called Baidya, are a Muslim community found in eastern India. They are a community of pastoralists, who traditionally specialized in the castration of cattle. The community speak a number of dialects of Bengali and use the surnames Chaudhary, Sekh, and Mondal.Marginal Muslim Communities in India edited by M.K.A Siddiqui pages 263-267 Name of the community The community has several names, like Bedia Kudmi, Shershahbadia, Bhathia, Wandering Kurmis, Maldahiya, Badia and Bedia. However its official name is Sharshahbadia. Origin The Bedia are found mainly in central and north West Bengal, the Purnia Division of Bihar, Rajshahi District of Bangladesh, the Terai region of Nepal and southern Bhutan. In West Bengal, the Bedia are found mainly in the districts of Murshidabad, Nadia, Malda, South Dinajpur, North Dinajpur and Darjeeling. In Bihar, where the community is known as Shershahabadia, are found mainly in Kishanganj, Purnea and Katihar. The bedias are also found in the district of Jharkhand, mainly in Bhagalpur Marginal Muslim Communities in India edited by M.K.A Siddiqui pages 263-267Ethnographic notes on the scheduled tribes of West Bengal by Manas Kamal Chowdhuri; West Bengal (India). Cultural Research Institute Present circumstances Traditionally, the Bedia were a pastoral group who used to breed buffaloes, sheep, and goats, with the castration of cattle being a secondary occupation. By the 19th century, the majority of the Bedia had settled down to cultivation, and a majority were small and medium- sized farmers. A small number of Bedia were also jotedars, or large landowners, particularly in Malda. Presently, the bulk of the community remains cultivators, with a smaller numbers employed in the military and police services.Marginal Muslim Communities in India edited by M.K.A Siddiqui pages 263-267 The Bedia are an endogamous group, and marriage occurs within close kin. In Bedia society, consanguineal kin are classed into two categories, the bhiad or minimal lineage and khandan or maximal lineage. Marriages are preferred within the bhiad. Bedias of West Bengal now belong to the Ahle Hadith sect, which distinguishes from other Bengali Muslim communities. The Shershahabadia of Malda and Bihar remain Sunni Hanafi. Traditionally, each Bedia settlement consists of a paich, or caste council. These remain informal, and there is no India-wide formal caste association. The council consists of a hakim or headman, a jurist or mahat and a dhuli or messenger. All intra-group or inter-religious matters and disputes are settled by the paich. According to Risley, the Bedia are divided into sects. However, the present survey identified some exogamous clans, namely Phecha, Kachhua, Mahua, Bambi, Suiya, etc. The marriage age for boys and girls is sixteen to seventeen years and fourteen to fifteen years, respectively. A marriage is arranged though monogamy is prevalent. Married women put a vermillion mark and wear an iron bangle as marriage symbols. The payment of bride price is obligatory. They follow the rule of patrilocal residence. Either spouse can seek divorce with social approval on grounds of adultery, barrenness, maladjustment, cruelty, or laziness. Remarriage of widows and divorcees is permitted and a widow can marry her late husband's brother. The Bedia live both in nuclear and extended families. Sons inherit parental property in equal measure while the eldest son succeeds to his father's authority. A woman contributed to the family income and is tonsured. The first cereal feeding ceremony is optional. The marriage rites are performed at the bridegroom's house. The dead are buried. The death rites observed are telnahan and daskarma. The Bedia are followers of the traditional tribal religion. Their family and clan deities are Mai, Mudkati Kundri Bansa Darha, etc. The village deities worshipped by them are Jher-buri Gawandeti Mahadania, Durga and the regional deities are Palcharu and Badpahari. They visit the annual fairs at Rajarappa, Hundru and Jonha falls and Jaganathpur. The Bedia celebrate festivals like Phagun, Sarhul, Karma, Jitia, and Sohrai. The Bedia who have settled down in West Bengal, are also known as the Bedia Kudmi, Choto Kudmi or San Kurmi. They speak Kudmali, an Indo-Ayan language, at home and Bengali for inter-group communication.

History Although located in the London Borough of Ealing, this an extramural cemetery was created and open in 1855 by the St Mary Abbots parish in North Kensington, with the assistance of the Hanwell Urban District Council. This was to take the pressure off St Mary's own burial grounds which were almost full. Moreover, burials within the capital were now looked upon as a potential health problem and so the Burial Act 1857 was passed. One of the provisions was for new interments to be carried out beyond the densely populated areas of London. It lies on the east side of Hanwell's boundary with West Ealing and the old boundary stones can still be seen along the ground's eastern perimeter. In common with the Victorian style for parks, it is intricately landscaped with many curving paths. A variety of trees including yew, pine and oak are spread throughout the grounds with tall cedars around the perimeter help to create a more interesting vista than would an open and repeating grid system of graves. The entrance from the Uxbridge Road is through a tall stone arch with heavy iron gates and past a lodge. A long avenue of tall evergreen yew, holly and box hedging, leads to the burial area and the chapel which is situated towards the centre. The chapel (which is now disused and in disrepair), lodge and arch, are built of Kentish Ragstone in the Revived Gothic style. All three were designed by Thomas Allom whose name appears inscribed atop the arch. He himself is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery. It was then taken over by the then Metropolitan Borough of Kensington and they opened another cemetery, nearby at Acton in 1926. It is now owned by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. Ecology Before the Inclosure Acts, this ground was the deep, rich, common land, known as East Field. The land is drained by a very small brook which rises from a spring in nearby Milton Road just to the north. This flows unseen now, through a culvert that runs under the grounds towards the Uxbridge Road in the south. Its distance from main roads, the shelter given by the trees and general lack of busy activity, makes this a very peaceful place. It is no wonder therefore, that the cemetery has become something of a sanctuary for wild birds. The London Borough of Ealing views it as part of a conservation corridor with that of its neighbouring cemetery the Westminster City Cemetery, Hanwell on the opposite side of the Uxbridge Road.

Japan Publications, Tokyo 1982. , S.232f. While in western medicine the palpation of the abdomen (abdominal examination) is aimed at the physical organs palpable in that area to assess their size, shape, consistency, reaction to pressure and such, in eastern medicine the Hara is seen as an area that reflects the state of all the organs (physically palpable in the abdomen or not), their energetic as well as their physical state, and their complex functional relationships with each other.Matsumoto, Kiiko/ Birch, Stephen; Hara Diagnosis: Reflections on the Sea. Paradigm Publications 1988, , pp.315‚Äì. In diagnosis and treatment, the Hara is partitioned in areas, each of which is considered ‚Äì on the basis of empirical evidence ‚Äì to represent one of the (ten, eleven or twelve) vital organs AND their functional energy fields. The details of this basic model of Hara diagnosis may differ from school to school, depending on which underlying philosophical, physiological, pathological or therapeutic model of Japanese or Chinese medicine is being used (e.g. Five Elements, Five Phases, Yin and Yang, Zang FuMaciocia, Giovanni; The Foundation of Chinese Medicine.

While in China, or some parts of Chinese society, pulse diagnosis may have been culturally more acceptable for being less intimate or invasive than Hara diagnosis or whole body palpation, it has also been claimed that the cause for its increasing use may have to do with the prevalence of certain traditions or schools of Chinese medical theory ‚Äì in the past as well as in the country's recent history.Seem, Mark; Acupuncture Imaging. Perceiving the Energy Pathways of the Body. A guide for practitioners and their patients. Healing Art Press Vermont, 1990. . To put this into context it is worth considering that, in the West, we have, of course, always depended not only on the (more or less accurate) transcription and translation of existing source material, but also on what has been made available for translation, i.e. what has been made accessible for Westerners via teaching and training, opening of archives and libraries, and more recently via modern editions. It is therefore, if not surprising so in any case educating to observe, that French practice and research in the field of far-eastern or oriental (as some prefer to call it) medicine has often relied on Vietnamese teachings, sources and literatureSeem, Mark; Acupuncture Imaging. Perceiving the Energy Pathways of the Body. A guide for practitioners and their patients. Healing Art Press, Vermont 1990. , p.5-8, p.17ff. (note that in colonial times, Vietnam was part of French Indochina), while earlier German and English practitioners and researchers seem to have drawn on pre-modern Chinese sources (note that European powers were influential in China during the Qing dynasty(1644‚Äì1911). American practitioners and scholars in the field, on the other hand, seem to have benefited initially from post-war Japanese material, which became available after the country had fallen under American administration in 1945 (History of Japan) but, after the opening of China in the seventies, began to source their materials there. It is fair to say, that in present days most new source materials and commentaries used by researchers, and consequently teachers, students and practitioners, are those being printed and published by research institutes of the People's Republic of China.Seem, Mark; Acupuncture Imaging.

As mentioned above, within this tradition, variations on the theme can be found as different schools base the development of their clinical work and theoretical models on different aspects of the philosophical and medical foundations they are building on. The contemporary Meridian Therapy School of Japanese Acupuncture for example, in which amongst others Shudo Denmei (1932‚Äì ) is a leading figure,http://www.tcm- kongress.de/en/programm/referent-414.htm places much importance on a wide range of palpatory skills in diagnosis and treatment.

However, an ever growing number of body-mind therapies are being introduced to or developed in the West, which seem to be influenced by concepts directly or indirectly derived from or related to Eastern models of abdominal diagnosis and therapy, some using breathing techniques (Buteyko, Yoga), postural alignment and movement education like Postural Integration, Feldenkrais, Alexander Technique, Qigong and Yoga, or manual manipulation like Osteopathy, Shiatsu and massage. All aiming, it can be said, to relax, strengthen and support in their function the internal organs and tissues in, above and below the peritoneal cavity ‚Äì in other words: the abdomen or Hara, with a view on holistic healing. In Osteopathy for example, an important part of abdominal work is the stimulation of venous circulation and the drainage of lymph,Stone,Caroline; Science in the Art of Osteopathy. Osteopathic Principles and Practice. Stanley Thornes, Cheltenham 1999. , p.236-252 another the re- alignment of the organs.Helsmoortel, J√©r√¥me, Hirth, Thomas, W√ºhrl Peter: Visceral Osteopathy: The Peritoneal Organs, Eastland Press Seattle, 2003. For details: http://www.eastlandpress.com/books/visceral_osteopathy_the_peritoneal_organs.php .  In the martial arts  It may be helpful to point out, to start with, that many problems in understanding concepts integral to East Asian culture have arisen simply due to divergent use of transcription, uncertain pronunciation and out-of-context translation, starting within the wider Asian community (Chinese into Japanese e.g.), and from there spreading by different pathways to the West. In martial arts, the Hara or Dantian is sometimes considered as equivalent to the lower of the three dantian (tanden in Japanese1). Various styles of martial arts describe this as being just below or directly behind the umbilicus.Yang, Jwing-Ming; QiGong Meditation. Embryonic Breathing. YMAA Publication Centre Boston, US, 2003. , p.120-168 In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) the by-name Dantian is given alternatively to three acupuncture points: the \\"Gate of Origin\\" (Ren 4), and the \\"Sea of Qi\\" (Ren 6),Deadman,Peter& Al-Khafaji,Mazin, with Baker, Kevin: A Manual of Acupuncture. Journal of Chinese Medicine Publications, Hove (East Sussex) 1998, , p.501-506 and, by some, also to the \\"Stone Gate\\" (Ren 5).Matsumoto, Kiiko& Birch, Stephen: Extraordinary Vessels. Paradigm Publications, Brookline (Mass)1986, p.119. All three points are situated on the midline (centre of the linea alba) of the lower abdomen (i.e. below the navel). They constitute part of the Ren Mai, usually translated as Conception Vessel (CV), which is one of the Qi Jing Ba Mai, the Eight Extraordinary Vessels or eminent energy pathways of the body. Dantian is often translated as \\"elixir field\\", indicating that the needling points called \\"Sea of Qi\\", \\"Gate of Origin\\" and \\"Stone Gate\\" are not really sitting on the Ren Mai like dots on a line. Rather they represent a place from which the \\"Sea of Qi\\" etc. can be reached and influenced ‚Äì either via the energy flow along the Ren Mai (Conception Vessel) or by penetrating deeper into the abdomen (the level to be determined by the length of the needle and the depth of its insertion, in the case of palpation, by the depth of penetration and Qi projection, in the case of breathing or movement exercises by the use of muscle tonus and combination, direction of connective tissue engagement etc.). Hence, as the point names indicate, the lower Dantian, which ever point it is associated with, ought to be seen as a three dimensional area of varying size inside the abdomen, not as a point on the abdomen. In that sense it is identical with the \\"small hara\\" or the \\"small abdomen\\", terms used in some Chinese classical texts and commentaries that discuss the origin and location of the Qi Jing Ba Mai (Eight Extraordinary Vessels) to which the Ren Mai belongs and is connected.Matsumoto, Kiiko& Birch, Stephen: Extraordinary Vessels. Paradigm Publications, Brookline (Mass)1986, p.27,40,41,97. Modern commentators believe that the terms refer to \\"the kidney reflex area below the umbilicus\\".Matsumoto, Kiiko& Birch, Stephen: Extraordinary Vessels. Paradigm Publications, Brookline (Mass)1986, p.40. The Hara or lower Dantian, as conceptualised by the Chinese and Japanese martial arts, is important for their practice, because it is seen, as the term \\"Sea of Qi\\" indicates, as the reservoir of vital or source energy (Yuan Qi). It is, in other words, the vital centre of the body as well as the centre of gravity. For many martial arts, the extension of energy or force from this centre is a common concept.Ratti, O. & Westbrook, A.; Secrets of the Samurai: A survey of the martial arts of feudal Japan. Tuttle, 1991, p.387 Many martial art styles, amongst them Aikido, emphasise the importance of \\"moving from the hara\\",Raposa, M.: Meditation and the Martial Arts. University of Virginia Press, 2003, p.18-19. i.e. moving from the centre of one's very being ‚Äì body and mind. There are a large number of breathing exercises in traditional Japanese and Chinese martial arts where attention is always kept on the dantian or hara to strengthen the \\"Sea of Qi\\".  Martial arts and the Eastern medical tradition  It seems that in the West eastern martial arts have, for a long time, been taught without much reference to the knowledge pertaining to the field of the healing arts, whereas in the East there was traditionally a strong interface between both practices ‚Äì not least for the purpose of sustaining physical strength and healing injury. As mentioned above, language barriers, uncertainty of oral tradition and lack of in-depth training and proper source material as well as the vast variety of schools can easily lead to terminological imprecision, misinterpretation and misunderstanding. An example at hand is the question of the Hara: what and where is the Hara or Dantian (tanden); why is it so important in both traditions; and how is it related to the Eight Extraordinary Vessels and the other energy pathways (meridians or channels). A closer look at the discourse on location and function of the Extraordinary Vessels reveals that not only the Ren Mai (Conception Vessel) is involved with the function of the Hara or Dantian, but that the Chong Mai (Penetrating Vessel, the Du Mai (Governing Vessel) and the Dai Mai (Girdle Vessel)The given translation of these Chinese terms follows the \\"Manual of Acupuncture\\", which has the best illustrations: Deadman, Peter & Al-Khafaji, Mazin, with Baker, Kevin: A Manual of Acupunture. Journal of Chinese Medicine Publications, Hove (East Sussex) 1998, , p.495ff. Although fairly common usage, the English is neither very elegant, not does it seem to grasp the full meaning of the terms. also play a part in defining the What and Wherewithal of the \\"Sea of Qi\\", as all of them take part in one way or another in strengthening the lower Dantian and maintaining its connection and interaction with those energy fields of the body expressed in the form of meridians and organs. To see why this would be so and why there is such a wide scope of interpretation, it helps to have a look at the discourse arising from the varying description of the starting points and passageways of those vessels in the body, and the variation in terminology used in the respective sources.Matsumoto, Kiiko &Birch;, Stephen: Extraordinary Vessels. Paradigm Publications Brookline (Mass.), 1986. . The pitfalls of translation, interpretation and association we have already seen for the case of the \\"Dantien\\" can also be found for the acu-point \\"QiChong\\" on the stomach meridian (ST30). In the classical literature of Chinese Medicine ST30 is widely said to be the starting point of the Chong Mai (Penetrating Vessel). The trouble is that ST30 is also known by the name of \\"QiJie'\\". The author Ling Shu for example writes in his commentary: \\"To explain about qijie: in the chest the qi has a jie, in the abdomen the qi has a jie, in the head the qi has a jie...\\". It has been suggested, that Ling Shu means to say that \\"QiJie\\" is \\"a meeting place of qi\\".Quotes and commentary in Matsumoto, Kiiko &Birch;, Stephen: Extraordinary Vessels. Paradigm Publications Brookline (Mass.), 1986. , p.32-37. This makes sense seeing that the character \\"GuanJi√©\\" ‚Äì built from Guan (gate) and Ji√© (knot, tie, weave) ‚Äì means \\"joint\\" (anatomical), but also \\"crucial link\\", \\"crucial point\\" or \\"crucial phase\\". Hence the starting point (or place) of the Chong Mai (Penetrating Vessel) could be seen as identical with the lower Dantian ‚Äì as suggested by the diagrams in the Manual of Acupuncture.Deadman,Peter& Al-Khafaji,Mazin, with Baker, Kevin: A Manual of Acupunture. Journal of Chinese Medicine Publications, Hove (East Sussex) 1998, , Chapter \\"Extraordinary Vessels\\". While martial arts teaching benefits from a deeper insight into the knowledge gathered in the traditions of Chinese and Japanese medicine, an ever stronger case is made for students and practitioners of the healing therapies based on those traditions to engage in practices such as Qigong, TaiJi or Aikido to enhance Qi cultivation, perception and projection. Certainly from a classical Eastern point of view, knowledge and regular practice of those disciplines would have been (and is) seen as an essential part of self-development aimed at strengthening the practitioner's own health as well as their understanding of the nature and flow of Qi. Without such personal and refined experience, it is considered difficult to foster and improve the skill of palpation at a level that allows the practitioner to determine the quality of Qi in his or her patient and influence it accordingly.Yang, Jwing-Ming; The Roots of Chinese QiGong. Secrets for Health, Longevity, & Enlightenment. YMAA Publication Centre, Wolfeboro, US, 2nd edition, 1989, reprint 1997, Likewise the recommendation for patients is (and has been) to engage in Qi enhancing exercise to regain and maintain health.

History  The British Standards Institution announced the development of the PAS 2060 Standard for Carbon Neutrality in October 2009 with the objective of increasing transparency of carbon neutrality claims by providing a common definition and recognized method of achieving carbon neutral status. The steering group was made up of a number of public and private organisations and associations, including the Association of British Certification Bodies, Aviva, BREEAM (BRE Environmental Assessment Method), Carbon Clear, The Carbon Neutral Company, EcoAct, The Carbon Trust, The Co-operative Group, Department of Energy and Climate Change, Eurostar, Future Conversations (Concrete Centre), Good Energy, Institute of Environmental Management and Assessment, Marks and Spencer, Oxford Brookes University and UPM-Kymmene. PAS 2060 Specification for the demonstration of carbon neutrality was launched in June 2010.  Compliance with PAS 2060  The specification defines a consistent set of measures and requirements for entities (e.g. organisations, governments, communities, families, individuals) to demonstrate carbon neutrality for a product, service, organisation, community, event or building.BSi. PAS 2060:2010 Specification for the demonstration of carbon neutrality. , April 2010 The carbon footprint measurements should include 100% of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, plus all Scope 3 emissions that contribute more than 1% of the total footprint. The entity must develop a Carbon Management Plan which contains a public commitment to carbon neutrality and outlines the following major aspects of the reduction strategy: a time scale, specific targets for reductions, the planned means of achieving reductions and how residual emissions will be offset. PAS 2060 requires that the total amount of carbon emissions at the end of a reduction period be offset by high- quality, certified carbon credits which meet the following criteria: ‚Ä¢ From one of the PAS 2060 approved schemes (for example the Clean Development Mechanism, Joint Implementation or Verified Carbon Standard) ‚Ä¢ Genuinely additional (i.e. reductions that would not have happened anyway) ‚Ä¢ Verified by an independent third party to ensure that emission reductions are permanent, avoid leakage (so that emissions are not increased in another area as a result of the project reductions) and are not double counted ‚Ä¢ Retired after a maximum of 12 months to a credible registry.  Documentation and verification  PAS 2060 requires a standard-compliant declaration of achievement of neutrality through a set of Qualifying Explanatory Statements and public disclosure of all the documentation that supports the carbon neutrality claim. The standard stipulates three types of validation of the achievement of neutrality: self validation, other party validation and third party independent validation. Other party validation occurs when the methodology and data has been audited and verified by an external organisation; third party independent validation occurs when it is verification is by an agent registered with UKAS.

He opened a photography studio and also took photographs on travels around the country. The product of these serve as a record of the development of the country at this time. Early life According to Bragge's death certificate, he was born in 1833, in South Shields, County Durham, England. His father, also called James, worked as an architect. His mother‚Äôs name was Harriett (n√©e Wigglesworth). In 1854, at the age of 21, James Bragge Jr. married Elizabeth Ann Fish. They had two daughters. He remarried in 1900, at the age of 67, to Lydia Segus Banfield, who bore him a further daughter. Move to New Zealand Little more is known of Bragge, but we do know that he came to New Zealand in 1865. Within a short while he had opened a photographic studio in Manners Street, Wellington. This studio was advertised as \\"The New Zealand Academy of Photographic Art\\". During his time in New Zealand, Bragge made at least two trips over the Rimutaka Range to the Wairarapa, and the Manawatu District. In 1871, he travelled with his family to Auckland. By 1879, he had returned to Wellington, and opened a studio in Lambton Quay which operated until the 1890s. The Wellington City Council commissioned Bragge to take various photographs of Wellington, for show at the Melbourne International Exhibition in 1880. He died in Wellington on 17 July 1908.W. Main, Bragge‚Äôs Wellington and the Wairarapa, pp. 7‚Äì19, Millwood press, 1974Nineteenth Century New Zealand Photographs, J. Turner, n.d. Career as a photographer In his early life Bragge's profession was that of a cabinetmaker. It was only with the advancement in technology that during the early sixties he was able to engage in photography. It is difficult to ascertain how he developed his skills in photography. Similar to many photographers, he began as a studio portrait photographer. He later travelled around the lower North Island, with his darkroom contained in a horse-drawn carriage. He travelled to small towns and took photos of the locations, some including the local people. It appears that he made postcards from the photos, and sold them to the townsfolk. They in turn would send these postcards to their relative in England, as a kind-of curio of what New Zealand was like. His photographic skill is very evident in the many photos he took during the Wairarapa expeditions. William Main states in his book, Bragge's Wellington and the Wairarapa, \\"Street scenes of 1869 are not rare, but those filled with people are.\\"W. Main, Bragge's Wellington and the Wairarapa, p. 10, Millwood press, 1974 This may explain the interest in Bragge's photographs. A wide variety of his photos included people, some even believed to be of Bragge himself. \\"It was 1876 when Bragge first hitched a mobile darkroom to a horse, and rode northwards toward the Wairarapa, taking photos along the way. These show places like Danniverke, Norsewood and Eketahuna, where huge tracts of land were being cleared, and roads bridges and settlements were being built. Bragge's photos were immediately popular with Wellington audiences, who saw them as representing progress.

It has been argued that the two poles of similarity and contiguity are fundamental ones along which the human brain is structured; in the study of human language the two poles have been called metaphor and metonymy, while in the study of the unconscious they have been called condensation and displacement. In linguistics, they are connected to the paradigmatic and syntagmatic poles. The couple metaphor-metonymy had a prominent role in the renewal of the field of rhetoric in the 1960s. In his 1956 essay, \\"The Metaphoric and Metonymic Poles\\", Roman Jakobson describes the couple as representing the possibilities of linguistic selection (metaphor) and combination (metonymy); Jakobson's work became important for such French structuralists as Claude L√©vi-Strauss and Roland Barthes. In his essay, Jakobson also argues that metaphor is the basis for poetry, especially as seen in literary Romanticism and Symbolism, whereas metonymy forms the basis for Realism in literature. For non-linguists, a metonym can be considered a low- imagination metaphor, an allusion via an actual property (or close approximation/association of) the concept being substituted (the too on-the- nose referent). E.g., writing by pen and violence by sword in the pen is mightier than the sword. In the unconscious: condensation and displacement According to Freud's work (1900), condensation and displacement (from German Verdichtung and Verschiebung) are two closely linked concepts.BlackwellReference.com In the unconscious, through the dynamic movement of cathexis (charge of libido, mental or emotional energy), it is possible that an idea (image, memory, or thought) passes on its whole charge to another idea; Freud called this process \\"displacement.\\" It is also possible that a single idea takes the whole charge of more than one other ideas; Freud called this process \\"condensation.\\"Leopold Szondi (1956) Ich-Analyse, subtitled Die Grundlage zur Vereinigung der Tiefenpsychologie.

When completed, it will be the longest subsea interconnector in the world. Route Map of cable route The cable will run from Kvilldal, Suldal, in Norway, to Cambois in the United Kingdom. Its converter station in England will be located near to the cable landfall in East Sleekburn village and it will be connected to the National Grid at the Blyth substation. Technical description The cable will be long. It has a planned capacity of 1,400 MW. It is estimated to cost ‚Ç¨2 billion and become operational in 2021. The offshore cable will be supplied by Prysmian. The cable will be manufactured at the Arco Felice factory in Naples, Italy, and it will be installed by the cable-laying vessel Giulio Verne. Cable for the fjord, tunnel and lake sections, and the onshore connection in Norway, will be supplied by Nexans and manufactured at Nexans' plant in Halden, Norway. It will be laid by using Capjet trenching system and the cable-laying vessel Skagerrak. The HVDC converter stations will be built and installed by the ABB Group. Ownership It is a joint project of the transmission system operators Statnett and National Grid plc. Current status As of February 2020, the UK on-shore cable has been installed between the landfall at Bucca headland and the converter station site at East Sleekburn. The converter station is under construction. Future plans The cable is due to be completed in 2021. The interconnection may also connect the North Sea wind farms as well as offshore oil and gas platforms, becoming the backbone of the proposed North Sea Offshore Grid. Project history The project was first proposed in 2003 when Statnett and National Grid prepared a 1,200 MW interconnector between Suldal in Norway and Easington, County Durham, in the United Kingdom. This project was suspended. On 6 October 2009, Statnett and National Grid announced they were conducting a feasibility study of the cable. According to the pre-feasibility study the project will be economically and technologically feasible. It will be a commercial cable jointly owned by Statnett and National Grid NSN Link Limited, a subsidiary of National Grid. National Grid quotes various groups in favor of more interconnections.Getting more connected, page 3-4. National Grid, 2014. The route survey of the offshore section was conducted by MMT in 2012. In March 2015, Statnett and National Grid announced a decision to \\"start the construction phase\\", a month after announcing the \\"Nemo link\\", a similar connection between the United Kingdom and Belgium. Along with Viking Link from Denmark, they would increase the UK's electricity interconnection level (transmission capacity relative to production capacity) from the 6% it was in 2014.COM/2015/082 final: \\"Achieving the 10% electricity interconnection target\\" Text PDF page 2-5. European Commission, 25 February 2015. Archive Mirror Economy Once completed the North Sea Link will give the UK access to the south Norway bidding area (NO2) of Nord Pool Spot with an annual transmission capacity of 12.3 TWh. According to the analysis by the United Kingdom market regulator Ofgem, in the Base case scenario the cable would contribute around ¬£490 million to the welfare of the United Kingdom and around ¬£330 million to the welfare of Norway. According to the analysis, over the 25-year cap and floor regime (a regulation for how much money a developer can earn once the interconnector is in operation) the benefit of the United Kingdom consumers is expected to be around ¬£3.5 billion under the Base case scenario. Once the cable is completed the average domestic consumer bill in the United Kingdom would be around ¬£2 less. According to Auke Lont, CEO of Statnett, Norway may use the interconnector to import electricity at times of peak supply in the United Kingdom, which could temporarily reduce hydroelectricity output in Norway and shift Norwegian hydroelectricity production to peak demand times. In 2014 the Norwegian energy service provider Markedskraft analyzed the impact of two interconnectors under construction from Norway, the North Sea Link and NorGer a submarine cable of identical capacity connecting Norway with Germany. The electricity will at any moment flow towards the country with the highest price and these price differentials generate income for the interconnector whether the electricity flows one way or the other. Markedskraft estimated that while the Norwegian import and export via NorGer will zero out in 2020, the annual net export to the UK via North Sea Link is projected to be about the 10 TWh, i.e. almost all of the interconnector's annual capacity. Markedskraft go on to estimate that the increased demand for Norwegian electricity via North Sea Link will increase the price of electricity in Norway by 25 NOK/MWh (ca. 2.6 ‚Ç¨/MWh). A 2016 study expects the two cables to increase price in South Norway by 2 √∏re/kWh, less than other factors.https://www.nve.no/Media/5160/2016_12_nve_kraftmarkedsanalyse_mot_2030.pdf See also *NorthConnect *NorNed *NorGer *NORD.LINK *BritNed *Viking Link References External links * *Page on 4c Category:Electrical interconnectors to and from Great Britain Category:Electrical interconnectors to and from the Nordic grid Category:Electric power infrastructure in England Category:Electric power infrastructure in Norway Category:HVDC transmission lines Category:Electrical interconnectors in the North Sea Category:Norway‚ÄìUnited Kingdom relations Category:Proposed electric power transmission systems ","title":"North Sea Link"},{"id":"29592431","text":"Aesculus indica, commonly known as the Indian horse-chestnut or Himalayan horse chestnut, is a species of deciduous broad-leaved tree in the family Sapindaceae.

Uses Its leaves are used as cattle fodder in parts of Northern India. Its seeds are dried and ground into a bitter flour, called tattawakher. The bitterness is caused by saponins, which are rinsed out by thoroughly washing the flour during its preparation. The flour is often mixed with wheat flour to make chapatisPlants and people of Nepal, By N. P.

He was mainly active in the 1980s and, during that time, attracted media attention, but has not done so since his conviction in 1992. By his own description, Graf Adelmann is a \\"man with many ideas\\". Biography Rainer Rene Graf Adelmann von Adelmannsfelden was born under the name Rene Freiherr von Godin as the son of a Bavarian lawyer in 1948. He married Michaela Gr√§fin Adelmann von Adelmannsfelden (born 1953) in 1973 and the couple had ten children, born between 1974 and 1988. His wife is the niece of the late German federal MP (1957‚Äì1961) Raban Graf Adelmann (1912‚Äì1992).Adelmann von Adelmannsfelden worldroots.com, accessed: 22 November 2010 Rene Freiherr von Godin assumed the title Graf Adelmann von Adelmannsfelden in 1980. During the mid-1980s, the couple resided in the village of Sentenhart, near Wald, between Lake Constance and Sigmaringen. The Bavarian ministry of justice cancelled Graf Adelmann's registration as a lawyer in the state in 1982 for discrediting acts unworthy of a lawyer, however, Adelman took the case to the Bundesgerichtshof but eventually decided to discontinue his registration himself. Federation of German mercenaries Graf Adelmann, in the early 1980s, founded the Federation of German mercenaries for the purpose of recruiting mercenaries in Germany for service in Asian and African countries. German law prohibits the recruitment of German citizens for military service in foreign countries and the very attempt is punishable with up to five years of jail. However, Graf Adelmann considered this law invalid as it, in his opinion, violates the freedom of employment specified in the German constitution. He operated his business through the company Terfina Verm√∂gensverwaltungs-GmbH, and contacted foreign, mainly Asian and African embassies and governments for the purpose of building a clientele. By 1985, Graf Adelmann had over 400 job applications, targeting former Bundeswehr soldiers and unemployed adventurers through newspaper ads. In 1985, he claimed to have received interest from an undisclosed African country for the purpose of protecting an oil pipeline. He also claimed to have interests from Mozambique to provide personnel for the protection of the Cahora Bassa Dam. He saw an opportunity to provide personnel to developing countries who still \\"required adjustments to their borders and forms of government\\" but lacked qualified personnel to operate their modern weapons equipment. His initial plan was to recruit a platoon of 50 mercenaries, led by a number of retired Bundeswehr sergeants. To join the Bund deutscher Legion√§re, BDL, one had to pay DM 20 as a joining fee, followed by another DM 20 as a yearly membership fee. For this, Graf Adelmann promised combat training in Belgium and shooting practise in Switzerland, at the weapons manufacturers premises. His new recruits would have to \\"learn to kill\\" but he saw great potential in 18-year-olds in this regard. He also guaranteed that the bodies of fallen \\"heroes\\" would be returned to Germany and their memory adequately honoured. Christian association for family development Another business Graf Adelmann operated was the Christian association for family development, targeted at childless parents who were interested in adopting an as yet unborn or unconceived, baby. The association was officially shut down in the mid-1980s but continued to operate nevertheless. Adelman charged up to DM 32,000 for a successful adoption, with part of this money going to the mother of the child. The Prosecutors Office at Konstanz investigated against the business but was unable to prosecute as it violated no existing law at the time, declaring Adelmann had found a loop hole. He later opened an agency for adoption in Frankfurt am Main in early 1988 but had to close after the mayor of the city ordered it shut down. The business suffered a temporary setback when his aunt was arrested in Manila for kidnapping but later released. Organ donation business In the business of organ donations, Graf Adelmann would approach people who recently had to declare bankruptcy, as published in the Bundesanzeiger, a federal publication, and offered to help them to financial recovery by paying up to DM 80,000 for a kidney, depending on the quality of the organ. Surgery would then be performed in France, Adelman claiming that organ donation for money being legal there despite the fact that both French and German doctors had voluntarily outlawed such transactions. In France however at the time, donations from live donors were acceptable, providing no money was involved. Graf Adelmann just simply would keep the full truth from the performing clinic and thereby was able to carry out his business.Organ Selling organselling.com, accessed: 21 November 2010 Graf Adelmann later declared that no operations were carried out. In 1989, he tried to expand his business to the United Kingdom and was able to find a number of willing donors there, offering between US$30,000 and 50,000 per kidney, with the intention of making a 20% cut on every operation. The willing donors never heard from Graf Adelmann again after the initial contact. Shortly after, the British Parliament banned the sale of human organs for the purpose of transplants.Sales of Kidneys Prompt New Laws and Debate The New York Times, published: 1 August 1989, accessed; 21 November 2010 Graf Adelmann's activities even prompted a request in the German Parliament, the Bundestag, in 1989, to tighten the organ donor law in the country and to shorten the lengthy donation process. A number of MP's of the Social Democratic Party of Germany posted the question what the federal government would do against Adelmann's activities.

At the time, Nepal was under the reign of a rigid monarchical authoritarian regime known as the panchayat system (defined as a party-less system). No progressive thoughts were allowed in literary works, nor was any printed material or professional group formation allowed without the government sanction during this period. Progressive writers were suppressed and subjugated by the government and its vigilant sneakers. Thus they rebelled pronouncing themselves as Aswikrit Jamat i.e. rejectionists; not merely \\"rejected generation\\" but \\"rejecters\\" of all imposed authoritarian, undemocratic and unrealistic values by the rigid regime and old traditions. In the words of Dr. Kavitaram Shrestha, who is one of the initiators of the movement, the mission of the Aswikrit Movement is to - fight against established regressive orthodox legacies that hinder the substantial progression of a time, value and society, and at the same time direct the energies for the progression for the multi-communal benefits ensuring equal opportunities for the weak and marginalized thoughts, concepts, values, people and communities. It even fights its own legacies and established values for the refinements. He says ‚ÄòAswikrit Literature is the literature of opposition‚Äô. Aswikrit Jamat (Nepali: ‡§Ö‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡•Ä‡§ï‡•É‡§§ ‡§ú‡§Æ‡§æ‡§§) The rebellious Aswikrit Jamat (the Rejectionists) were numbered with 16 writers.

Later, the number of rebels was not increased as the group perceived that the rebellion had to be through their writings but not with their name itself. Besides, one could reveal his/her unity through any forms of radical campaign. The rebellious writers started this movement with an unregistered literary journal Sanjeevani, edited by Kavitaram Shrestha and Nepal Bhushan Neupane. Later three more casual unregistered journals also joined the movement. They were: Mantra-5 (edited by Kavitaram Shrestha and Shailendra Sakar), Resha-4 (edited by Anjir Pradhan Pidit), Kshitij (edited by Mohan Singh Thapa). In 1974, the Aswikrits with other prominent protestors had also organized a symbolic protest with the Boot-polish Campaign in New Road of Kathmandu still under the tyrant monarchichal regime of Panchayet System.

It is named in honour of Jos√© Batlle y Ord√≥√±ez, President of Uruguay from 1903-1907 and 1911‚Äì1915. Location The barrio is located south of Italia Avenue and north of Rivera Avenue and includes the districts Belgrano, Italiano, Villa Dolores and the park area. It borders the barrios Tres Cruces to the west and north, La Blanqueada and Uni√≥n to the north, Buceo to the east and Pocitos to the south. The park covers an area of and is considered the \\"lung\\" of Montevideo owing to the large variety of trees planted here. It is home to the Estadio Centenario national football stadium, as well as the national monument \\"La Carreta\\". History In 1907, Pablo Nereo Gabriel Antonio Pereira (1838‚Äì1906) donated eleven acres of his land, which was then named after him as \\"Campo Pereira,\\" for a building a park, to the Economic Management Board, and the idea of a park was created by an Act of March 1907 which also projected wide boulevards and avenues. The project's landscape French architect, Carlos Thays, began the plantings in 1911 and completed it with all the attendant embellishments required for a park. In 1918, the park was named \\"Allied Park,\\" following the allied Army winning the World War I thus honouring the heroes of the Allied Forces. The park was further expanded to the present status, which covers an area of . This extension was made possible owing to an estate that Antonio Pereira in his \\"Will\\" had bequeathed partly to the municipality in May 1930. The Board then further acquired more land and created the Great Park Pereira seen in its present status. On 5 May 1930, it was again renamed as Parque Batlle y Ord√≥√±ez, in memory of the President of Uruguay, who had died in 1929. In the same year, the Estadio Centenario was opened. Between 1935 and 1938, the athletics track and the municipal velodrome were completed. It was designated a National Historic Monument Park in 1975. The barrio Estadio Centenario Parque Batlle is counted as one of the seven coastal barrios, along with Punta Carretas, Pocitos, Buceo, Malv√≠n, Punta Gorda and Carrasco. It is characterized as being of high population density and most of the households are of medium-high- or high-income. According to Administraci√≥n Nacional de Educaci√≥n P√∫blica (ANEP) of Uruguay, the Parque Batlle school district, Villa Dolores, was ranked 55 of 60 for the period of 1990‚Äì1999. The park area The park Along with Parque Prado and Parque Rod√≥, Batlle is one of three large parks that dominate Montevideo.Finzer, p. 11 The park contains the 70,000 seat Estadio Centenario, built for the first soccer world cup in 1930, which is both the national football stadium and it contains a football museum. There is also the Tabar√© Athletic Club which is occasionally made over as a carnival theatre using impermanent materials. The Municipal Velodrome, two smaller stadiums (the Parque Palermo and the Parque Luis M√©ndez Piana), and a target shooting facility are additional attractions.Finzer, p. 103 It is an ideal place for walking, hiking or exercise and enjoy the fresh air provided by the wooded area. Villa Dolores and the Zoo of Montevideo Villa Dolores is a district of Parque Batlle. It took its name from the original Villa of Don Alejo Rossell y Rius and of Do√±a Dolores Pereira de Rossel who started there a private collection of animals which became a zoological garden. It was passed to the city in 1919, and in 1955 the Planetarium of Montevideo was built within its premises. Monuments Monumento a la Maestra, Parque Batlle. In 1934, \\"La Carreta\\", a bronze monument on granite base by Jos√© Belloni was introduced. The monument, one of several statues in the park, is located on Avenida Lorenzo Merola near Estadio Centenario and depicts yoked oxen pulling a loaded wagon. It was designated a national monument in 1976. Another statue in the same side of the park is a bronze copy of the Discobolus of Myron. The Obelisk of Montevideo marks the west end of the park area. On the West side of Parque Batlle, on Artigas Boulevard, there is the Obelisk of Montevideo, a monument dedicated to those who created the first Constitution and inaugurated in 1938. It is a monumental work of the sculptor Jos√© Luis Zorrilla de San Mart√≠n (1891‚Äì1975). It is a three-sided obelisk made of granite, tall with 3 bronze statues on its sides, representing \\"Law\\", \\"Liberty\\" and \\"Force.\\" It has a hexagonal water fountain around it with six spheres on its outer circumference.

Instead, a Mumbai Consensus > based on the idea of a democratic developmental state, driven not by a > mercantilist emphasis on exports, but a people-centered emphasis on growing > levels of consumptions and a widening middle class.\\" Larry Summers Summers also suggested that India's model may become increasingly viable for other nations because it does not fail the middle class but instead allows this group to prosper, whilst not deviating from the traditional capitalist approach to running the economy.India and the Global Economy  The White House However, Summers acknowledges a number of challenges that would hurt the viability of a Mumbai Consensus, with a need of continued assurance of efficiency of government whilst also having continued faith in the public sector and action which means that continued economic prosperity does not just lead to the success of a select few. =Pluralistic Democracy= The strength of India's democracy has consistently shown itself in fair and free elections, at regular intervals without being characterized by military coups or frequent martial law impositions.Gateway House The Mumbai Consensus November 18, 2010 In the 2009 Indian Lok Sabha (lower house of Parliament) elections, 300 political parties and almost 8000 candidates ran for office. Voting occurred at 828,804 polling stations across the country. Such a diverse democracy works in a polity largely based on the rule of law. Enshrined in the Indian Constitution, political and media freedoms provide a continual framework for negotiations by stakeholders of their right to participate and achieve in society. Earlier, a rigid caste system has skewed political freedoms and achievement to the higher classes but Dalit or lower caste populist leaders like Mayawati, Chief Minister of the largest and most populous state of Uttar Pradesh, prove that such social barriers are gradually breaking down. With 1652 languages and dialects spoken, the Indian democracy is home to an incredible diversity of ethnic and linguistic backgrounds. India contains the majority of the world's Zoroastrians, Sikhs, Hindus, Jains and Bah√°'√≠s. India is also home to the third largest Muslim population in the world after Indonesia and Pakistan. Gender issues, long a thorny criticism of India, have improved. Out of 3.5 million village legislators, 1.2 million are women. Though gender issues continue to be a persistent issue, especially in conservative rural areas, a young woman in India has the possibility of pursuing a political or entrepreneurial career, spurred on by countless micro- finance institutions, that only lend to women entrepreneurs. The ability of a country characterized by such diversity to continue to participate in a democratic framework has many policy implications for similarly diverse countries around the world. = Gradualism in decentralization, privatization, and entrepreneurship= Though India, post independence, started down a socialist government route spearheaded by Nehru and similar to China's state- run model, over time, India's political framework has gradually decentralized and power has shifted to state and local legislative bodies. Further, India has gradually liberalized economically, especially since 1991 when former Finance Minister and former Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh initiated a series of economic and financial liberalizing reforms. As opposed to the quick-fire privatization campaigns seen in Argentina or the Czech Republic, India has opted for a gradual move away from large state owned enterprises, a feature that contradicts both the Washington Consensus in terms of its pace and the Beijing Consensus in terms of its focus. Labelling it ‚Äòdisinvestment‚Äô, the government's program started by simply reducing the government's holdings in such large enterprises by 20%, gradually followed by 49% and finally by large- scale transfers of control to private domestic and foreign investors. Important public sector enterprises that have been privatized have been the Indian Petrochemicals Corporation, Bharat Alumnium Company and Hindustan Zinc.Devesh Kapur and Ravi Ramamurthi Privatization in India : The Consequences of Gradualism The advantages of a gradual process of privatization is that it allows for the implementation of efficiency enhancing reforms that complement privatization, a feature sorely missing from similar privatization efforts in Latin America and Eastern Europe. The consensus now is in favour of establishing an institutional framework conducive to promoting competition before privatizing firms. Gradual privatization also gives governments time to adjust price controls and subsidies without which privatization is unlikely to yield the anticipated improvements in efficiency and resource allocation. Finally, the lag in time allows for the creation of regulatory agencies like the Indian TRAI (telecom), SEBI (capital markets), TAMP (ports) and CERC (power) that are positioned to prevent some of the excesses that lead to the recent global recession. On the micro-level, this gradual emphasis on privatization has pushed the Indian entrepreneur on to the centre stage of India's economic growth. A sharp contrast from China's state run economic model where only 10% of credit goes to the private sector, India's economic growth in the past 20 years has been marked by high levels of private entrepreneurship. Over 80% of loans across the country go to private sector players. In 2002, the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor Report listed India as 2nd in terms of total entrepreneurshop activity, though it ranks much higher in necessity based entrepreneurship as opposed to opportunity based entrepreneurship.Global Entrepreneurship Monitor Report. Asian Entrepreneurs =Domestic demand driven and service dominated= One of the most unusual features of the Indian economic development model has been that India's GDP growth has been driven by domestic demand and consumption. From 1980 to 2002, India's economy grew at 6% per year and at 7.5% from 2002 to 2006. Today, domestic consumption accounts for 64% of India's GDP as opposed to 58% for Europe, 55% for Japan and 42% for China. Morgan Stanley's Stephen Roach comments that ‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs consumption-led approach to growth may be better balanced than the resource-mobilization model of China.‚Äù Booming domestic demand and consumption has allowed Indian firms to diversify from export-led growth and hedge against global fluctuations in consumer demand as well as has created a vibrant middle class in India, of almost 250 million people. One of the most potent critiques of the Washington Consensus-based economic development model is that it does not cater to the middle class and creates widening gaps between the richest and poorest in the economy. While India is still a hugely unequal country, its Gini Index (that measures income inequality) is 33 on a scale of 0‚Äì100, as compared to 41 for the US, 45 for China and 59 for Brazil. A large component of this reduced income inequality is due to India's growth being driven by domestic demand and consumption by the middle class. Another extremely unusual feature of the Indian model is that it has not followed Rostow's traditional model of moving from an agrarian economy to a low-skilled manufacturing economy to high-tech manufacturing and finally, a service economy. While China's success has largely been based on moving from an agrarian economy to mass manufacturing of cheap goods that are exported to the West, India has almost skipped the middle step of creating a strong manufacturing base and directly invested in becoming a service economy. While there are strong manufacturing industries in India, a lot of them are concentrated around high-tech manufacturing. Propelled by the availability of skilled human capital, India's services sector has grown at 7.5% from 1991 to 2000 and now consists of 55% of India's GDP. Information technology and business process outsourcing are among the fastest growing sectors, having a cumulative growth rate of revenue 33.6% between 1997‚Äì98 and 2002‚Äì03 and contributing to 25% of the country's total exports in 2007‚Äì08. The growth in the IT sector is attributed to increased specialization, and an availability of a large pool of low cost, highly skilled, educated and fluent English- speaking workers, on the supply side, matched on the demand side by increased demand from foreign consumers interested in India's service exports, or those looking to outsource their operations. The share of the Indian IT industry in the country's GDP increased from 4.8% in 2005‚Äì06 to 7% in 2008. In 2009, seven Indian firms were listed among the top 15 technology outsourcing companies in the world. =Non-expansionist, internationally status quoist geopolitical strategy= Since Independence, India has maintained a strong neutral stance on global geopolitical shifts, especially the Cold War, that have both hindered and assisted their economic development. Post Independence in 1947, Indian foreign policy was fundamentally dependent on Jawaharlal Nehru, whose views were largely internally focused. Nehru valued Indian territorial sovereignty and realized the need for an adequate defense of this sovereignty, but otherwise, was largely of the view that India's economic development needed to be internally focused. After having been the victim of British mercantilist trade policies for centuries, Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi both stressed the need for autarkic indigenous industrialization and independence from the Great Powers of the time. Nehru, along with Abdel Nasser in Egypt and Joseph Tito in Yugoslavia, were champions of the Non-Aligned Movement, that sought to maintain neutrality in the Cold War. . In the 1960s and 1970s, New Delhi's international position among developed and developing countries faded in the course of wars with China and Pakistan, disputes with other countries in South Asia, and India's attempt to balance Pakistan's support from the United States and China by signing the Treaty of Peace, Friendship, and Cooperation with the Soviet Union in August 1971. Although India obtained substantial Soviet military and economic aid, which helped to strengthen the nation, India's influence was undercut regionally and internationally by the perception that its friendship with the Soviet Union prevented a more forthright condemnation of the Soviet presence in Afghanistan. In the 1980s, New Delhi improved relations with the United States, other developed countries, and China while continuing close ties with the Soviet Union. Relations with its South Asian neighbors, especially Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Nepal, occupied much of the energies of the Ministry of External Affairs.James Heitzman and Robert L. Worden India: A Country Study. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1995. There are, of course, examples, where India did not seek an internationally status quoist geopolitical strategy, specifically in their pursuit and achieving nuclear weapon state status. In response to aggressive overtures from both Pakistan and earlier nuclear-armed China, the pursuit of nuclear weapons in India was as much a security concern as it was a case of pursuing international prestige. Till date, India has not signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and has been the first state to receive exemptions from the treaty in 2011 (U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Agreement) allowing for the resumption of nuclear material commerce between India and the world. Post the Cold War and the 1991 economic liberalizing reforms have forced India to reevaluate their non-expansionist geopolitical strategy. The end of the Cold War gutted the core meaning of non alignment and pragmatic security, economic considerations, and domestic political influences have reinforced New Delhi's reliance on the United States and other developed countries; caused New Delhi to abandon its anti-Israeli policy in the Middle East; and resulted in the courtship of the Central Asian republics and the newly industrializing economies of East and Southeast Asia. Coming to the 21st century, India's new, more powerful position in the world economy asks for India to assume a more expansionist role, especially as a potential regional hegemon. India must seek to extend its influence in the Central Asian, South East Asian and East Asian republics. However, its prior non-expansionist model of geopolitical strategy is a useful model for developing countries to follow during a time when they are still sorely under-developed. =Areas to Improve= Gurcharan Das comments that there are still sectors of the Indian economy, and thus Indian development, that need a lot of work. A legacy of the Gandhian peasant farmer ideal, the Indian agricultural sector is woefully unmodernized and hindered by a vast system of regulations and protection. Das believes India needs to shift focus from peasant farming to agribusiness and encourage private capital to move from urban to rural areas. There is also a need to lift onerous distribution controls and allow large retailers to contract directly with farmers. Greater investment in irrigation infrastructure and advanced farming methods will follow from the consolidation of fragmented holdings. A peculiar phenomenon of the Indian growth story is that it occurs not without the government, not because of the government, but despite the government. The Indian bureaucratic system continues to remain inefficient, non-transparent and a hindrance to business. Patna, the capital state of Bihar, is a prime example of where easing regulatory reform and reforming the bureaucratic structure has contributed to economic growth. Largely a result of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's work, Patna is now the second-easiest city in India to start a business with 11 stages in the process, 8 of which are national and common across states. Patna is also the leader in best practices in India in the cost to start a business (38.5% of income per capita), the cost to deal with business-related construction permits (204% of income per capita) and the cost to enforce contracts (16.9% of the claim value). However, these numbers do not hold up too well when compared to global averages. Patna ranks 137th in the world in terms of number of procedures, 124th in terms of costs to start business and 31st in terms of costs to enforce contracts.Doing Business in India: Sub national Report. World Bank and International Finance Corporation, 2009 Report Das points to electrical utility coverage and reliability, an extremely complicated tax regime that creates incentives for tax evasion, and a woefully inadequate public education system as some of the other areas that require dire attention and much greater investment from the Indian government.

Description The mangrove may grow as a single-stemmed tree or multi-stemmed shrub. It has short buttresses at the base of the trunk, and knee-like air-breathing roots, or pneumatophores. The bark is a smooth grey- brown colour. The smooth, glossy green leaves are simple and opposite, elliptic to elliptic-oblong, 9.5‚Äì20 cm long, 3‚Äì7 cm wide, with a pointed apex and a 6 cm petiole, occurring in clusters at the end of the branches.Mangrove Web. The flowers have a pale yellow-green to pinkish-orange calyx with 12‚Äì14 lobes, 20‚Äì24 stamens and 10‚Äì12 creamy-orange, bi-lobed petals. The green, cigar-shaped viviparous propagule grows from within the calyx and is 5‚Äì12 cm long and 1‚Äì2 cm wide. Distribution and habitat The mangrove is distributed from India eastwards along the tropical coasts of Southeast Asia to northern Australia and New Caledonia. It is found on various substrates usually in the upper reaches of river-mouth estuaries with high rainfall and significant freshwater inflow. Ecology The large flowers of the mangrove are bird- pollinated. The petals are under tension and hold loose pollen; when the flower is probed, the pollen is released explosively over the head of the visiting bird.Wild Fact Sheet. Uses The mangrove has various traditional uses in Asia. The developing embryos and the fruits are cooked and eaten after soaking. Juice from the fruits is used to treat sore eyes, shingles and burns. The timber is heavy, hard and strong and is used as poles as well as for firewood and charcoal.

ECL agreements by law apply to all rights holders in a class, whether they are members of the collecting society or not, and establish terms of licenses with users or classes of users. The first ECL laws and agreements were established in the Nordic countries in the 1960s for television and radio broadcasting. ECL laws and agreements ECL is a form of collective rights management whereby ECL laws allow for freely negotiated copyright licensing contracts for the exclusive rights granted by copyright. ECL laws are designed specifically for mass use, where negotiating directly with individual copyright holders is not possible because of their sheer volume. Under ECL laws, collecting societies negotiate ECL agreements on behalf of their members, as well as non-members because ECL laws allow collecting societies to enter into ECL agreements on behalf of all rights owners of the category of rightsholder the collecting society represents. Once the collecting society and the user, such as a TV broadcaster, have negotiated an ECL agreement, it comes into force and covers only the types of copyrighted works for uses specified in the ECL licence. ECL in Nordic countries The first extended collective licensing (ECL) laws were established in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden (Nordic countries) in the 1960s. Committees in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, with participation from Iceland, reviewed copyright laws and proposed ECL for the use of literary and music works under copyright in radio and TV broadcasting. In subsequent years ECL has been extended to other copyrighted works and areas of use, including the reuse of broadcasts through re-broadcast, on demand services and mass digitisation by libraries. Authors, performing artists, publishers and producers are well organised in Nordic countries and collecting societies have a high membership. Collecting societies cooperate in many instances to offer joint licensing agreements. According to Daniel Gervais these are ideal conditions for collective rights management of copyright and related rights through ECL. =The Nordic model= While individual ECL laws and agreements in Nordic countries vary depending on type of copyrighted works and area of use, the Nordic model shares the following characteristics: * ECL laws assume that collecting societies represent copyright and related rights owners in a particular area and that collecting societies can conclude contracts, i.e. copyright licenses, on behalf of their members * subject to certain conditions, such as representing a substantial number of rights owners, collecting societies can under ECL law apply to represent all rights owners on a non-exclusive basis in a specific category of copyrighted works * ECL laws provide that a collecting society can through free negotiations conclude an ECL agreement with a user for certain uses * ECL laws prescribes that this ECL agreement applies to members of that collecting society, as well as non- members * ECL laws requires that collecting societies treat rights owners who are non-members in the same way they treat their members * ECL laws gives non- members the right to individual remuneration, i.e. royalty payment, by the collecting society * ECL laws typically gives non-members the right to exclude their works from ECL agreements so that a collecting society can not license their work under an ECL agreement (though not all ECL laws in Nordic countries provide an opt-out right) * ECL laws and ECL agreements ensure that the user who has entered an ECL agreement with the collecting society is not subject to copyright infringement actions in relation to the use specified in the ECL agreement (this does not apply to works that are subject to an opt-out)  ECL in the United Kingdom  The British Government introduced extended collective licensing into UK copyright law in 2013 as part of the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2013/24/contents/enacted This was in part in recognition of the fact that collecting societies had for decades been offering licences that included the work of non-members. If a collecting society is granted the right by government to operate an ECL non-members can receive individual remuneration (i.e. royalty payments) as if they were a full member of a collecting society. Unlike some Scandinavian countries, non- members are given the right to opt out from any ECLs offered. The UK has introduced a general and flexible right for collecting societies to operate extended collective licences for many different purposes, as long as they can prove to government they are sufficiently representative of the sector they operate in. This contrasts to Swedish and Czech law where there is only a list of specific uses to which licensing of this sort can be put.  ECL in the Czech Republic  Extended collective licensing in the Czech Republic covers uses as wide as making available copyright works by libraries through to radio and television broadcasts.  EU law  Paragraph 18 of the InfoSoc Directive preamble states that ‚ÄúThis Directive is without prejudice to the agreements in the Member States concerning the management of rights such as extended collective licensing‚Äù. The principle of collecting societies representing non- members can also be found in the Satellite and Cable Directive. The directive provides that authorisation regarding non-members is to be dealt with collectively. Article 3.2 of the directive outlines the following criteria for collective management of rights, which is allowed under the directive. It states that: > \\"A Member State may provide that a collective agreement between a collecting > society and a broadcasting organization concerning a given category of works > may be extended to rightholders of the same category who are not represented > by the collecting society, provided that: * the communication to the public > by satellite simulcasts a terrestrial broadcast by the same broadcaster, and > * the unrepresented rightholder shall, at any time, have the possibility of > excluding the extension of the collective agreement to his works and of > exercising his rights either individually or collectively.\\" Examples There are many examples of ECLs in operation, including * Much television and radio broadcast in Iceland, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark. * Many mass digitisations of in-copyright works by universities and libraries in Scandinavia are based on ECL. One example of this is the B√∏khylla project by the National Library of Norway which intends to digitise all books in the national library in Norwegian and make them available online.

He is the elder brother of All-Australian and premiership player, Brad Ottens, and the son of Dean Ottens. Early life He is the son of Dean Ottens, who was a talented ruckman for Sturt in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL). Dean played 116 games, won two premierships and representing South Australia seven times. Born on 22 May 1976, Luke grew up in a footballing family. His brother, Brad, had a successful AFL career, winning three premierships with Geelong. Brad claims his earliest memory is \\"playing in the backyard with [Luke]\\". Ottens began his career with Glenelg, playing in the SANFL. He was drafted in the inaugural rookie draft in 1997 by Port Adelaide, but he failed to play a game for Port, instead continuing to play for Glenelg. AFL career Ottens was drafted to the Melbourne Football Club with the 50th selection in the 1997 AFL Draft, the same draft in which his brother, Brad, was drafted by Richmond with the second selection. He injured his groin the December after he was drafted, requiring surgery. Ottens made his debut for Melbourne's reserves in April 1998. Ottens was hampered by groin problems for the remainder of 1998 and did not manage to break into the senior team, playing all his matches in the reserves. Ottens made his AFL debut in the first round of the 1999 season, playing against his brother, Brad, who was playing in his 13th match. Although a key-position defender, Ottens also played as Melbourne's backup ruckman, occasionally rucking directly against his brother during the match. He was, however, \\"dominated\\" by his younger, but substantially taller, brother in these encounters. In his third game, Ottens, along with fellow youngster Troy Longmuir, were praised for their \\"enthusiasm\\" in a game the Demons narrowly lost. Ottens was dropped from the team for Melbourne's round 5 match and he never made his way back into the Melbourne senior team in a career that was crippled by injury, causing the round 4 game to be his last AFL match. In May 1999, Ottens the medial ligament in his knee while playing in the reserves, sidelining him for six weeks. In round 13 of the 1999 season, Ottens injured his left knee, requiring a knee reconstruction, which ruled him out for the remainder of the 1999 season and half of the 2000 season. After successfully returning from injury in round 15 of 2000, Ottens then injured his right knee only four games later, again requiring a knee reconstruction. Due to his horrendous run with injuries, Ottens was delisted by the Demons at the end of the 2000 season. After being delisted, Ottens went back to his original team, Glenelg, and played for the Tigers from 2001 to 2002. Luke finished his career playing for the Encounter Bay Football Club in 2003‚Äì04.

AirPrint does not require printer-specific drivers. It was originally intended for iOS devices and connected via a Wi-Fi network only, and thus required a Wi-Fi access point. However, with the introduction of AirPrint to the macOS desktop platform in 2012, Macs connected to the network via Ethernet connection could also print using the AirPrint protocol‚Äînot just those connected via Wi-Fi. Direct Wi-Fi connection between the device and the printer is not supported by default, but has appeared as the 'HP ePrint Wireless Direct AirPrint' feature. History and printer compatibility Following the iPad's introduction in 2010, user concerns were raised about the product's inability to print, at least through a supported Apple solution. Apple founder and CEO Steve Jobs reportedly replied \\"It will come\\" in May 2010 to a user request for printing. AirPrint's Fall 2010 introduction, as part of iOS 4.2, gave iPhones and iPads printing capability for the first time. AirPrint for Mac computers was introduced in the Mac OS X Lion release. At launch, twelve printers were AirPrint compatible, all of them from the HP Photosmart Plus e-All-in-One series. As of July 2020, that number had grown to about 6,000 compatible printer models from two dozen different manufacturers. The current list can be found on Apple's support site. The related technology is covered by . Legacy printer support A number of software solutions allow for non-AirPrint printers to be used with iOS devices, by configuring support on an intermediary system accessible via Wi- Fi, connected to the printer. Since AirPrint is driverless, such a configuration compensates for the printer's lack of native AirPrint support by using the drivers on the intermediary system instead. The simplest solution for all platforms is to create a new Bonjour service that tricks iOS clients into believing they're talking to an AirPrint device. Many blog posts and commercial software products exist to accomplish this, as well as open-source solutions in Linux. This works in many cases because AirPrint is an extension of the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP), which many printers already support either directly, or as a result of being shared through an intermediary system (typically CUPS, the Mac/Linux printing system). This approach is limited however, as the AirPrint-specific components of the protocol are missing. This can lead to compatibility issues and unexpected results. Some software packages address this completely by translating between the two dialects of IPP, avoiding compatibility issues, while most just re-share printers using the AirPrint service name. For Microsoft Windows, there are free and paid solutions. On macOS, a Bonjour service exists that enables AirPrint support for legacy printers. Commercial macOS software for this purpose includes Netputing handyPrint and Ecamm Printopia. In most GNU/Linux distributions, AirPrint support should be automatic with the CUPS default printing subsystem since version 1.4.6 (such as Trisquel 5 and Ubuntu 11.04). CUPS servers before version 1.4.6 with DNS based Service Discovery can also be configured manually, by adding DNS-SD printer service discovery records to a name server. =Apps and utilities = There are a number of third party solutions, available on the Apple App Store and elsewhere, that allow printing to legacy printers directly or via an application helper. Netgear Genie, for both Mac OS X 10.6 or above and Windows XP, Vista, 7 and 8. Genie permits any shared, network attached printer to be made accessible via Airprint. The application is free for customers of current Netgear routers. Printopia Pro is a commercial solution designed to allow AirPrint to work on large business and education networks. It offers features useful to large organizations including centralized management, directory integration, and allows AirPrint to operate across subnets. It requires a server running Mac OS X 10.7 or later, and one server can potentially serve an entire organization.

Born in Crumlin in Monmouthshire, Power became the Welsh heavyweight champion in 1926. Boxing career Although there is little record of Power's amateur career, he is recorded on the 4 July 1925 as fighting professionally against Trevor Llewellyn at Lydney near the Wales/England border. Power took the fight on a points decision, and followed this with two wins in August, both in his home-town, over Eddie Wolf and Bill Bates. On 12 September, he faced Belgian Pierre Charles at The Ring in Blackfriars. Charles was the more experienced fighter, and would soon become Belgian and European heavyweight champion, but Power took the fight after Charles was forced to retire in the first round. He followed up this win by facing Con O'Kelly in an October fight in Manchester, losing by knockout in the third. 1925 ended with a challenge for the Welsh heavyweight title, arranged at the Palace Theatre in Crumlin on Boxing Day. His challenger was Tom Norris of Clydach Vale and the match was scheduled for fifteen three minutes rounds. The match only reached the eleventh round when Power was stopped via a technical knockout. On 18 February 1926, Power travelled to London to face Joop Liet, 'The Singing Dutchman', but Power was heavily beaten losing by knockout in just the second round. Despite the loss on 5 April, Power was given a rematch with Tom Norris in a challenge for Norris' heavyweight title. The bout was contested at the Taff Vale Park in Pontypridd in front of a record crowd, with a purse of ¬£150 as well as the title for stake. The twenty round contest went the full distance, and Power was declared victor on points decision making him the new Welsh heavyweight champion. After taking the title there is an absence of fight information of Power until 1928 when he faced Jack Stanley, British heavyweight title challenger. Stanley was disqualified in the fourth. A week later, on 4 August, Power fought George Christian of Columbus, Ohio at Pontypridd, beating the American with a clean knockout in the second. His final recorded fight that year was a loss to Charlie Smith at The Ring. The following year he took in two bouts with New Zealander George Modrich; the first ended in defeat for Power via technical knockout in a fight held at Newport, while the rematch at Merthyr Tydfil was won by Power. Power completed 1929 with a loss to Don Shortland at Liverpool Stadium, before beating Dave Magill, the Irish heavyweight champion in an encounter at Pontypridd, followed by a loss to Jack Stanley and a draw with Marine Bill Trinder. Power had three recorded matches in 1930, the first was to future Northern Area heavyweight champion Bob Carvill. The two met at the Royal Albert Hall, which saw Carvill disqualified in the second round. He then lost to both Reggie Meen, by technical knockout, and Jack Pettifer, on a points decision. In 1932 Power was challenged for his Welsh heavyweight belt by Cardiff's Jack Petersen. The two men met at Greyfriars Hall in Cardiff in a fifteen-round bout, but Power's defence was a short one being counted out within 21 seconds of the first round. Petersen went on the become British and European champion and was one of the great Welsh fighters of his time. Power has two more recorded fights, both six years after his defeat to Petersen. He lost by points to another British champion, Welshman Gipsy Daniels and a win over South African heavyweight champion Don McCorkindale.

He appeared in more than twenty film roles and worked as an on-air presenter and broadcaster on Springbok Radio. Additionally, Courtney co-founded Radio Today in 1996. Biography Courtney was born Christopher Robert Courtney Leaver on 31 October 1922, in Dorset, England, UK. He trained as an accountant. A self-taught pianist, he was drafted into the Royal Air Force's entertainment corps as an entertainer during World War II. Courtney served as an RAF entertainer in North Africa, Greece and Italy. He met two South African entertainers, Siegfried Mynhardt and Uys Krige, in Rome, Italy, near the end of World War II. Krige and Mynhardt persuaded Courtney to move to South Africa. Courtney emigrated to South Africa in 1946 and began working at the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) in 1947, using the shortened name Bob Courtney. He hosted many of the SABC's most well-known radio shows during the 1940s. In 1950, Courtney began hosting the Welcome Little Stranger children's show on the now defunct Springbok Radio. His radio name on the show was \\"Uncle Bob.\\" However, his most famous job at Springbok Radio was hosting the hugely popular quiz show Pick a Box, which aired for fourteen years from 1960 until 1974. Courtney toured South Africa with the show throughout its airing, attracting large crowds of fans. In one instance, the Mayor of East London sent a limousine to meet Courtney at the East London Airport, where he had arrived to host Pick a Box in the city. Courtney broadcast Pick a Box from a variety of unusual locations including Antarctica, the Cango Caves, the Union-Castle Line and a mine shaft. The popular radio show ended in 1974. Pick a Box was briefly resurrected as a television quiz show in the 1980s with Courtney once again as its host. However, the TV version was not a hit and was quickly cancelled. Courtney's other shows on Springbok Radio included the Eyegene Jackpot game show, which aired from the 1950s until the 1970s, and Stop the Music, which aired for ten years. He also launched the Springbok show Greet the Bride, which would air for five days per week for twenty years on the radio. He attempted to reopen Springbok Radio after the station was closed in 1985. However, the South African Broadcasting Corporation decided against the relaunch of Springbok Radio in 1994, citing financial concerns. Courtney also co-founded a radio station, Radio Today, in 1996 with former Springbok Radio broadcaster Peter Lotis. The station's targeted audience were listeners in their 50s and older. The station attracted more than 70,000 listeners, but did not attract advertisers. Courtney hired a financial adviser, who saved Radio Today, though Courtney disagreed with some of the station's new financial and creative directions. He retired from Radio Today in 2008. Courtney's acting career spanned several decades and included more than twenty film credits. His film roles included Lord Oom Piet in 1962, Kruger Millions, All the Way to Paris, Dingaka and Hans en die Rooinek. He was also a founding member of the South Africa National Theatre. In the 1980s, he ran a steakhouse in Johannesburg. Bob Courtney died in Johannesburg at the age of 87 on 24 October 2010, just one week before what would have been his eighty-eighth birthday. His funeral was held at the St. Martin's-in-the-Veld Anglican Church in Dunkeld, Gauteng. Courtney was survived by his wife, Yvonne, and their two children.

Since 2005 he is professor of entrepreneurship and innovation at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), and since 2007 also dean of the Industrial Engineering & Innovation Sciences department. In the early 1990s, Georges Romme introduced Boolean comparative analysis to the organization and management sciences. He also developed and pioneered the \\"thesis circle\\", a tool for collaboratively supervising final (BSc or MSc) projects. He was one of the original pioneers who brought design thinking and the design sciences to organization studies.Paul Bate in: Journal of Applied Behavioral Science, vol. 43, 2007, p. 10; Jean Bartunek in: Organization Management Journal, vol. 5, 2008, p. 12.Van de Ven, A.H.

Tuertscher (2008), Incomplete by design and designing for incompleteness. Organization Studies, vol. 29: 351-371. A key idea put forward by Romme (2003) and Romme & Endenburg (2006) is that design principles are instrumental in connecting description and explanation (by researchers) to design and construction (by practitioners). As such his work established the idea that social science-based research serves to advance the body of knowledge on management and organization, but needs to be complemented by pragmatic design knowledge for practitioners (e.g. managers, consultants).Hodgkinson, G.P. and D.M.

It is chiefly remembered because an actor had a fatal heart attack during transmission.

A little over halfway through the production, Gareth Jones complained of feeling unwell while off-set in make-up between two of his scenes, and then suddenly collapsed and died as he was about to continue. His character was due to die in the same way during the course of the play. Peter Bowles recalled many years later: \\"During transmission, a little group of us was talking on camera while awaiting the arrival of Gareth Jones's character, who had some information for us. We could see him coming up towards us, but we saw him fall. We had no idea what had happened, but he certainly wasn't coming our way.

Collective management organisations, such as collecting societies, typically represent groups of copyright and related rights owners, such as authors, composers, publishers, writers, photographers, musicians and performers. At the least, copyright owners authorize collective rights management organizations to monitor the use of their works, negotiate licenses with prospective users, collect remuneration for use of copyrighted works, ensuring a fair distribution of such remuneration amongst copyright owners. Governmental Supervision varies across jurisdictions, from being limited to antitrust regulation in the United States to sectoral regulators in jurisdictions like the EU, India.  History  Collective rights management is almost as old as copyright law itself. Collective rights management through a collecting society first occurred in France in 1777 for the use of dramatic and literary works in theatre, attributed to the efforts of Pierre Beaumarchais.Gervais, Daniel (2010). Collective Management of Copyright. Netherlands: Kluwer Law International. p. 4. . The first collecting society and collective rights management in music was established in 1850 in France.  Types of rights under collective management  Collective rights management through collecting societies typically covers the following exclusive rights granted under copyright law: * the right to public performance, for example when music is played or performed in bars or clubs. * the right to broadcasting, for example when live or recorded performances are broadcast on radio or television * the mechanical reproduction rights in recorded music, for example where works are reproduced in recording formats, such as CDs or cassettes * the performing rights in dramatical works, for example when a theatre plays a work * the rights of reprographic reproduction of literary and musical works, for example where a book or sheet music are copied using a photocopier * related rights, for example the rights of performers and producers in recorded music when used in broadcasts Collective management organisations The collective management of copyright and related rights is undertaken by various types of collective management organisations, most commonly collecting societies. Collecting societies act on behalf of their members, which may be authors or performers, and issue copyright licenses to users authorising the use of the works of their members. Collecting societies negotiate the royalty rates and other licence terms on behalf of their members and collect royalty payment on behalf of their members. Royalties are distributed by the collecting society to relevant members, who as individual right owners are not directly involved in the negotiation of the licence. Other forms of collective management organisations include rights clearance centres. Rights clearance centres are membership based and function like a collecting society, though the individual right owners who are members are directly involved in the negotiation of the royalty rates and other licence terms. So called one-stop shops are a coalition of collecting societies and rights clearance centres offering a centralised source for users to obtain licences. One-stop shops have become popular in response to multi-media productions requiring users to obtain multiple licences for relevant copyright and related rights.

He is well known as one of the foremost and earliest of modernistic painters in Burma. Training, memberships, and associations Aung Khin was born on 13 February 1921 in Nat Kyun Aung Myay village, Hsalingyi township, Monywa district, the youngest of seven children. His uncle and brothers ran a mixed art workshop, where he studied from the age of twelve. When he was sixteen, he moved to Yangon to study for five years as an apprentice under the London-trained Ba Nyan, whose works were primarily in a naturalistic and realistic vein. In 1947 Aung Khin moved to Mandalay where he married Tin Tin Aye. He became active in the Mandalay Artist's Association, and eventually became Secretary and President of the association. In Mandalay, he became an associate of Kin Maung (Bank)., a well-known Mandalay artist who proselytized heavily for a modernistic movement in painting in Burma through sponsoring workshops and writing papers. In 1978 he and his daughter Cho Cho Aung, also a painter, set up the Panthu Sanda Children's Art Centre. In 1981 he was elected vice president of the Traditional Art Association, and in 1994 he was made patron of the Mandalay Artists Association. In 1996 he started the Yellow Art Gallery in Mandalay, named after Frank Spenlove-Spenlove's Yellow Door School in London where Ba Nyan had studied. The Yellow Art Gallery is today run by his daughter Cho Cho Aung. Early recognition In 1952 Aung Khin won first prize for an oil painting in a USIS-sponsored All Burma Competition, and in 1960-61 he had several one-man shows in Mandalay and Yangon, one of which was sponsored by the Burma-America Institute. Oeuvre Aung Khin's work largely reflected the European influence of the colonial-era Burmese artists. This included impressionism, what has been described as a conceptual expressionism and other forms of abstract painting, including cubism. However, he attempted to develop a uniquely Burmese style in his work, often rendering figures in his expressionist paintings with bold outlines and strong color contrast showing influence of the ancient mural painting of Bagan. One of his more intriguing explorations was using abstract non- figurative painting as a means to express Buddhist concepts beyond the earthly (difficultly-visualized) realm, or one might say life after death in Brahmaloka and Devaloka, asking \\"How shall I draw the abode of Man and Deva?\\" His wife died in June 1994. After his wife died, perhaps realizing that his days left were numbered, he became extremely prolific, painting night and day. When he died, he left in the vicinity of 100 unsold paintings in his home in the care of his daughter Cho Cho Aung. His Buddhist paintings were among these last works. Aung Khin died on 14 May 1996.

History  Anna Truedsdotter Hansen (1851-1922) was born in H√§ssleholm Municipality - with her German husband she brought six children up in Omaha in the 1890s, of whom Louis P. Hansen was a familiar cigar maker. A grandnephew on the Swedish side is Stanley M. Truhlsen. The first Swedes in Omaha came through Florence at the Winter Quarters of the Mormons. The group continued to come through, particularly with the construction of the Union Pacific railroad in the 1860s and the Union Pacific Railroad Omaha Shops Facility near downtown Omaha. In 1871, a committee of Swedes came from Illinois to determine whether the Nebraska prairie was suitable for Swedish settlement and farming. When they did, this committee effectively ushered in an entirely new influence in the growth of the state. This led to a variety of towns being settled, including Stromsburg, Oakland, Pender, Wakefield, and Wausa. Other significant Swedish populations in Nebraska included Mead, Malmo, and Swedeburg. It also led to the development of Omaha's substantial Swedish population.  Neighborhoods  Omaha boasted an area of the city with such a heavy concentration of Swedes that it was called \\"Little Stockholm\\".Fors, J. (n.d.) \\"Immigrants in Nebraska\\", Concordia College. Retrieved 11/21/10.\\"K.G. William Dahl of Bethphage Mission\\" . Gr√∂nvall Website. Retrieved 11/21/10. That early area was in the Near North Side neighborhood, bordered by 21st and 18th Streets, from Cass to Cumming Streets. Further north in the Kountze Place neighborhood was another area with \\"many Swedes, some of the 'better class'\\". Other professional people who were from Sweden lived in the Gifford Park neighborhood around 36th and Cass Streets.\\"Swedish Churches in Omaha: Sites and Survivals\\". Gr√∂nvall Website. Retrieved 11/21/10. The impact of Swedes on the North Omaha community may be present in the Vikings mascot of Omaha North High School. Josie McCullough, who grew up in the Near North Side during the late 1800s, wrote, \\"In that neighborhood Swedish, Bohemian, Italian, Irish and Negro children all contributed to the process of Americanization.\\" By 1930, Swedes made up more than 10 percent of Omaha's population.  Institutions  There were a variety of Swedish institutions throughout Omaha, including religious, social, and economic facilities. = Churches = Second Baptist Church, originally built in 1889, was rebuilt in 1906 at South 26th and K Streets near South High. Swedish Salem Lutheran church on Vinton was the longest serving Omaha church with its original congregation, serving for more than 100 years from 1891 onwards. In 1922 the Trinity Lutheran Church at 30th Street and Redick Avenue in the Miller Park neighborhood of North Omaha was founded. These were both considered \\"children churches\\" of the original \\"mother churches\\", Immanuel Lutheran located at 17th and Cass, and the First Swedish Baptist Church. Other Swedish places of worship included First Swedish Methodist, Mission Covenant, Scandinavian Seventh Day Adventist, Holy Family Catholic, Trinity Episcopal, and Swedish Salvation Army. There was a notable corridor of Swedish churches along North 18th Street. The Immanuel congregation merged with its daughter, Zion, under the name Augustana Swedish Evangelical Lutheran in a building constructed at 36th and Lafayette Avenue near the Bemis Park neighborhood.Note: This citation is for the entire paragraph. The church is the subject of the 1966 Academy Award-winning documentary A Time for Burning. = Immanuel Hospital = On October 8, 1887, Reverend E.A. Fogelstrom and others organized the Evangelical Lutheran Immanuel Association for Works for Charity. In December 1890, the association completed construction of a hospital located at 36th and Meredith Streets in North Omaha. As the community's needs grew, a new hospital opened in 1910 in the same area, and a third hospital was built at the 36th and Meredith site in 1926. In the 1950s, a six-story addition to the hospital doubled its size. The current 166-acre site of the Immanuel Medical Center at 72nd and Sorensen Parkway opened on June 29, 1974. = Others = The Swedish Auditorium, a social hall, was located at 1611 Chicago Street near Downtown Omaha. The Auditorium housed a number of fraternities, including the Order of Vasa, the Vikings, Good Templars, and others. The Noon Day Scandinavian Club, a business group, has hosted Viking Fest, Christmas sm√∂rg√•sbord, Pea Soup supper, and an annual banquet annually since 1909. The Omaha Posten (Omaha Post) was a Swedish-language paper published for several decades. Today there is a Swedish consul in Omaha.  Famous Swedes from Omaha  *Carl A.

In this illustration, the Arctic front separates Arctic from Polar air masses, while the Polar front separates Polar air from warm air masses. (cA is continental arctic; cP is continental polar; mP is maritime polar; cT is continental tropic; and mT is maritime tropic.) The Arctic front is the semipermanent, semi-continuous weather front between the cold arctic air mass and the warmer air of the polar cell. It can also be defined as the southern boundary of the Arctic air mass. Mesoscale cyclones known as polar lows can form along the arctic front in the wake of extratropical cyclones. Arctic air masses in their wake are shallow with a deep layer of stable air above the shallow cold cool. Appearance in satellite images Arctic Fronts form in the Arctic region, and move southwards in southerly flows. When they reach Northern Europe, they have usually travelled over an open sea, and convective cloudiness has developed. The appearance of an Arctic Cold Fronts is then, essentially, that of a shallow Cold Front. Arctic Cold Fronts are usually so far north that Meteosat images alone are inadequate to recognize them. Also, the following conceptual models may look like Arctic Cold Fronts: polar Cold Front, Polar Low and Comma. The final check is best made using a loop of AVHRR images with the help of numerical model parameter fields. Types of Arctic cold fronts Arctic Cold Fronts can be classified into two types: *Baroclinic fronts These fronts resemble polar cold fronts, but are usually not so extensive. The frontal cloudiness becomes more convective with time. *Ice/sea boundary fronts These fronts form over the ice/sea boundary and move southwards with the basic flow. There is only an isolated Cold Front. Often this type is so shallow and weak that it can not be detected in Meteosat water vapour images.

During the 1990s and early 2000s the Kiruna Party was the dominant political force of Kiruna, dropping the Social Democrats with over a fifth of the electorate in its first showing in 1994. Later, successes were mixed, but dwindled after 2003, when the leadership of the town was forced to resign after internal disputes.

Published in 1927, it was the basis of the Erik Clausen's film of the same name in 1994, translated into English as My Childhood Symphony. Book In his autobiography, the Danish composer Carl Nielsen describes his early life on the island of Funen until he moved to Copenhagen in 1884 in order to study at the Conservatory. It has been pointed out, however, that as he did not begin writing the account until prompted by his daughter in 1922, the story he tells may have been somewhat over- romanticised, reflecting Hans Christian Andersen's similarly difficult childhood, also on the island of Funen.Sarah Gutsche-Miller, \\"The Reception of Carl Nielsen as a Danish National Composer\\", Thesis submitted to McGill University, August 2003. Retrieved 14 November 2010. The work does nevertheless provide a detailed account of the composer's early years and is a primary source of information about this period of his life. It describes the hardships of his family, how his father, a painter and farm labourer, went off playing the fiddle at local dances and celebrations to earn a little more. It tells of his earliest musical memories, especially the time when his mother handed him a violin when he was in bed with the measles. We also learn of his school life: \\"I was not very good at bookish subjects, but not one of the worst either\\". He was fortunate that Emil Petersen, a teacher at the school, \\"taught me later on to play the violin properly from notation\\", enabling him to play at dances with his father. He also tells us of jobs as a goose-herd when still quite small, a summer spent at a tile works, and an apprenticeship with a shopkeeper who went bankrupt. His musical career began when his father \\"had heard that there was an opening for a musician with the Sixteenth Battalion in Odense, We agreed that I should practise the trumpet intensively and register for the audition...\\" All went well and Nielsen was able to play in the band while taking violin lessons in Odense.\\"Funen Childhood\\", Carl Nielsen Society. Retrieved 14 November 2010. Film In 1994, Eric Clausen directed the 125-minute film, Min Fynske Barndom, which is based heavily on Nielsen's autobiography.

Reflec Beat uses a touch screen as its main method of control - the first in the Bemani series to do so - and has gameplay based on 2-player competition, which has been compared to air hockey. Originally released for arcades, six versions, not including expanded update versions, have been released. The gameplay has been ported to iOS as REFLEC BEAT plus, which has in turn been localised and released worldwide as REFLEC BEAT +.  Gameplay  Reflec Beat's gameplay consists of touching circular \\"Objects\\" as they reach the judgement area. There are two sets of judgement areas, one for each player and colour-coded red and blue. Usually the second player is computer controlled, but can be human controlled using linked arcade machines, or a single iPad with the iOS versions. After the player selected a song, Reflec Beat will automatically find an opponent who is playing the same song. If no opponents were found, it will automatically start the computer-controlled mode. Players are scored on the timing with which they hit the Objects; in increasing order of accuracy and score, timing can be marked as Good‚ÜíGreat‚ÜíJust. On the contrary, players lose points if they miss an Object. Bonuses are given for a Full Combo (hitting all the Objects) or completing the song with up to 2 misses. As the players hit Objects with Just timing, the Just Reflec gauge fills up. Once one of the segments has been filled, the player can touch and flick an Object with the Just timing, and it will be reflected at the opponent. A Just Reflec gives bonus points to the user and a greater score penalty if the opponent misses it. Typically, a song is considered passed if a player achieves 70% overall accuracy on it. Other selectable victory conditions also exist, such as completing the entire song with a life gauge which decreases with missed Objects (similar to Dance Dance Revolution's life bar) or causing a gauge to rise above a certain level by the end of the song (like the Beatmania series' Groove Gauge). The songs are in 3 different hardness levels: Easy, Medium, or Hard. In Reflec Beat Limelight, higher hardness levels will be presented. The note types are as follows: * Regular Objects: These move down the screen to the player's judgement line, ricocheting off the sides of the screen. Regular Objects can have black or gold rims: the gold-rimmed Objects will move back towards the opponent's judgement line once hit. Only the gold-rimmed Objects can be used to perform Just Reflec. * Chain Objects: These Objects are connected by a line. All Objects chained together will land in the same place on the player's judgement line. Each Object in the chain can be black- or gold-rimmed. * Long Objects: These Objects are longer, and must be held for their full duration. As of Reflec Beat: The Reflesia of Eternity, Long Objects steadily increase the player's combo as they are held. * Top Objects: These Objects are coloured green. Instead of moving to the player's judgement line, they move toward circular judgement zones above the line. Top Objects can be linked by chains, and Long Top Objects also exist. On Basic and Medium difficulty modes, two Top judgement zones exist on the left and right, with Hard mode and above adding a third in the centre. * Vertical Objects: Introduced in Reflec Beat Groovin'!!, these Objects move straight down, and are regularly used to make complex patterns. Initially these had a downward arrow head motif, emphasising their different nature from regular Objects, but as of Reflec Beat: The Reflesia of Eternity, they appear identical to regular Objects. Vertical Objects can be black or gold-rimmed, and can be chained or Long much like regular Objects. * Slide Objects: Introduced in Reflec Beat Volzza, these Objects move straight down and appear initially with an arrow head pointing to the left or right. The player must hold this Object and move their finger to follow the slide trail until the end. This variety of Object was removed from Reflec Beat: The Reflesia of Eternity, but remains in the iOS versions. * Big Bang Objects: Introduced in Reflec Beat: The Reflesia of Eternity, these are much wider than regular Objects. They move straight down and when hit, cause the screen to shake. On lower difficulty levels, as of Reflec Beat: The Reflesia of Eternity, only Vertical and Big Bang Objects are used. * Switch Long Objects: Introduced in Reflec Beat: The Reflesia of Eternity, these Objects are long, move straight down, and have areas where the player must hold and not hold down on them to maintain combo. These are only present on \\"White Hard\\" difficulty mode.  Releases  = Arcade = The initial release of Reflec Beat was location tested in April and June 2010, with the final release first appearing in arcades in Japan in November 2010, followed by expansion to other countries in Asia in 2011. In 2011, Reflec Beat Limelight was released, which featured several new songs and refinements to the gameplay. There was also a change in the grade system. In the system where the score was changed according to the winning and losing and the score at the end after finishing all the games in the early works, the lyme lights reflect the grades of the pure ones only when playing each song. The notation was also changed from D to S1 in green lime 0 to red lime 12. The color of Grade Lime is green - orange - blue - red in order, and the closer to red lime 12, the better. The biggest change is the change of the top note, the top note is not available, and the normal is the top note in 2-top format as in Reflective, and the top note is randomly displayed in both sides of the top note. The top note has been changed to a three-tier format with three left, center, and right positions, and the top note has been fixed as far as the top note to prevent a certain difficulty from rising. By fixing the position of the top note, we can create more and more diverse chords. Beginning July 14, 2011, The game will be beatmaniaIIDX 18 Resort Anthem and Reflec beat. BeatmaniaIIDX 19 Lincle was released on September 15, 2011. BeatmaniaIIDX 19 Lincle will be on the event and Reflec beat LimeLight will be available on November 16, 2011 with Reflec Beat LimeLight. Reflec Beat Colette was released in late 2012, and featured a season motif, with the seasons changing from Winter, to Spring, to Summer, to Autumn throughout 2013. A final \\"All Seasons\\" update was later released. Reflec Beat Groovin'!! was first released in 2014, with an expansion, Groovin'!! Upper, coming months later. These games introduced Vertical Objects, \\"Special\\" difficulty mode and song courses. Reflec Beat Volzza was released in 2015 and introduced Slide Objects. An expansion, Volzza 2, was released in 2016. Reflec Beat: The Reflesia of Eternity debuted in arcades in December 2016. The theme is RPG. The game was completely overhauled, removing almost every existing song from the song list and recharting the remaining songs. Special difficulty mode was replaced by White Hard, and old songs will return to the game on a regular basis as part of online updates. Systematically, batching speed, big bang and switch objects were added, and slide objects added in voyeur were deleted. Also, since the previous program is not used as it is, the existing data is incompatible and the contents are being renewed to the replicate specification. = iOS = Reflec Beat plus was released for iOS in 2011, with songs being obtained through purchasable song packs. The game has been gradually updated to match the same functionality as that of the arcade series. An international version, titled REFLEC BEAT +, has been released. It has a reduced song list which consists only of original songs.

There are many species which are endemic to Japan.  Diversity  Japan has significant diversity in flora. Of approximately 5,600 total vascular plant species, almost 40% are endemic. This richness is due to the significant variation in latitude and altitude across the country, a diversity of climactic conditions due to monsoons, and multiple geohistorical incidences of connections with the mainland.  Vegetation Types  Japan consists of roughly vegetation zones that are delineated by temperature and precipitation: the alpine region, subalpine region, summer- green broad-leaved forest region and evergreen broad-leaved forest region. Due to its substantial length of over 3,000 km from north to south and its mountain ranges that can exceed 3,000 meters, Japan's vegetation varies by latitude and by altitude. Evergreen forests tend to appear in the southern half of the Japanese mainland, with broad leaf forests, subalpine and alpine appearing with increasing frequency to the north and near mountains. = Evergreen broad-leaved forest region = The evergreen forest zone can be found along the coasts of the southern half of Japan and is most common zone in the Ryukyu Islands, Shikoku and, Kyushu as well as parts of southwestern Honshu with equal longitude. This region rises up to an elevation of 750 meters near Tokyo. At the coasts, the dominant forest canopy species are Castanopsis cuspidata and Machilus thunbergii. Inland, trees belonging to the genus Quercus are dominant. In lower layers, trees and shrub species include Camellia japonica, Neolitsea sericea, Aucuba japonica, and Eurya japonica. It is a characteristic of this zone that all these are evergreen species. = Summergreen broad-leaved forest region = These forests can be found in central Japan above 1,000 meters altitude and throughout parts of Hokkaido at elevations between 700 and 1,600 meters. These forests are also called Fagus crenata forests due to the prevalence of this tree species. On the western side, common species include Daphniphyllum macropodum, Cephalotaxus harringtonii, and Aucuba japonica. On the eastern side facing the Pacific Ocean, important species include Ulmus japonica, Arachniodes standishii , and Laportea macrostachya. This region has been particularly affected by human development and clearing of natural forests. Cleared lands tend to be replanted with Larix kaempferi, Cryptomeria japonica , and Chamaecyparis obtusa. = Subalpine and alpine regions = In Honshu, from 1,600 to 2,500 meters, and Hokkaido at slightly lower altitudes, character species in the subalpine zone are Vaccinium vitis-idaea, Vaccinium ovalifolium, Neottia cordata, Coptis trifolia. Distinguishing trees include Abies mariesii, Larix kaempferi, and Tsuga diversifolia. Above 2500 meters, vegetation has to contend with significant snowfall and high winds. Genera that can survive in these conditions include Phyllodoce and Harrimanella.

His best-known feats included water spouting, smoke swallowing, and nut and handkerchief swallowing followed by disgorgement in an order chosen by the audience. Ali's most famous stunt, and the highlight of his act, was drinking copious amounts of water followed by kerosene, and then acting by turns as a human flamethrower and fire extinguisher as he expelled the two liquids onto a theatrical prop. While these stunts were performed, a panel of audience members was invited to watch the show up close to verify that no trickery was employed. Although he never gained wide fame, Ali had a dedicated following on the vaudeville circuit in the United States. He performed for heads of state including Tsar Nicholas II of Russia. Judy Garland named him her favorite vaudevillian and David Blaine identified Ali as his favorite magician. Portions of his act were captured in the short film Strange as It Seems (1930) and in Politiquerias (1931), the Spanish-language version of Laurel and Hardy's Chickens Come Home. Two documentaries contain footage of Ali taken from Politiquerias: 1977's Gizmo!, and 1999's Vaudeville. Ali's unusual gastric abilities led to rumors that the Rockefeller Institute had offered a large sum of money to obtain his stomach post-mortem. After he died in England, his body was offered to Johns Hopkins University for study, though the offer was declined. Background Hadji Ali was born into a working-class family in approximately 1887 or 1892, depending on the source consulted, probably in Egypt. His fame was as a practitioner of a recognized vaudeville subgenre known as a \\"regurgitation act\\", involving the swallowing of material or objects and their regurgitation in various ways. Ali became aware as a child that he possessed an unusual gastric ability. He explained in response to audience questions at a performance held at St. Mary's Hospital in Niagara Falls, New York, in May 1926, that while swimming in the Nile as a ten-year- old boy, he naturally discovered that he could swallow a large amount of water and blow it out like a whale spouting. He continued to develop and refine the ability as he grew older. A more dramatic version of these events was provided by Ali's daughter, Almina Ali, in an interview in England after his death. She stated that his abilities were first learned through a single incident: while bathing in the Nile, he inadvertently swallowed a fish and an ample volume of water. Instead of dying, as those present thought he might, Ali simply regurgitated the liquid and the fish without ill effect. Ali learned that his regurgitation talents had the potential to entertain and to earn money through performance at the age of fifteen: > I tried out my tricks first of all in the street, swallowing many glasses of > water and then pouring forth a great fountain from one side of the road to > the other ... A cafe proprietor saw me doing this one day, and chased me > down the street. I thought he wanted to beat me up, but no‚Äîall he did was to > put a coin in my hand and ask me to repeat the trick. Finally, he was so > delighted that he asked me to come to his cafe and entertain the customers. Taking his abilities on the road, Ali met an Italian man in Cairo who signed him to a contract for music hall performances. Ali performed under contract throughout Europe and at times for heads of state. According to Ali, in or about 1914 he was summoned by Tsar Nicholas II of Russia to perform at the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg, Russia. He stated that the Tsar \\"must have liked my performance because he awarded me a special decoration, which is now one of my most treasured possessions.\\" Following World War I, Ali began managing his own affairs and toured the world, learning more tricks as he went. alt=Text only; black on white background; it reads: \\"COMING NEXT THURSDAY‚ÄîFRIDAY‚ÄîSATURDAY The most sensational Novelty of 1927 HADJI ALI Human Volcano‚ÄîHuman Aquarium‚ÄîFire Extinguisher EUROPE'S MIRACLE MAN Astounds the Most Critical Vaudeville's Newest Sensation\\" Ali came to the United States with Almina in the mid-1920s. They performed together at fairs, carnivals and in vaudeville, sometimes advertised under the collective name, \\"Hadji Ali & Co.\\" Almina played the part of assistant in her father's act, billed in his shows as \\"The Princess\\". Ali alone had a variety of stage names, including: \\"The Great Egyptian Miracle Man\\", \\"The Amazing Regurgitator\\", \\"The Egyptian Enigma\\", \\"The Human Aquarium\\", \\"The Human Volcano\\" and \\"The 9th Wonder of the Scientific World\\". Ali has been described as a \\"large, barrel-chested and bearded man ... [that cut] an imposing figure in his Arab costume.\\" Although Ali spoke a number of languages and became a naturalized U.S. citizen, it was reported that Almina acted as his interpreter in the United States and other places, as he did not speak English and was illiterate. Once he had gained some notoriety, Ali took on as his manager Hubert Julian, a former colonel in the Abyssinian Air Force. Although he developed a significant following, even being named Judy Garland's favorite vaudevillian, Ali \\"remained more a sideshow curiosity than a true vaudeville headliner\\" according to at least one source. Nevertheless, at the time of his death in 1937, Julian commented that Ali had \\"earned big money in America‚Äî$1,000 a week sometimes. I was building him up here [in Europe] and had a Continental tour arranged.\\" Performance Hadji Ali demonstrating his skills, 1927 The mainstay of Ali's act was \\"water spouting\\". After swallowing large amounts of water, 60 to 100 glasses at a time, he spouted the water in a continuous stream for a sustained period of time, sometimes approaching one minute. Another common trick was to swallow 30 to 50 unshelled hazelnuts (although one of his posters advertised 40 pecans), followed by another nut of a different variety, such as an almond. Ali then brought them up one by one with the odd-nut-out produced at a mark called out by the audience. In another trick, Ali swallowed three to six handkerchiefs of different hues and then produced them in a color order requested by audience members. In a 1929 article appearing in the Lowell Sun newspaper, physician Morris Fishbein speculated that for Ali's nut feat, the one nut of a different variety was held in the mouth rather than swallowed, thus allowing him to produce it on cue. Dr. Fishbein also stated that unnamed \\"investigators\\" were convinced that for Ali's handkerchief stunt, to produce them in the sequence stipulated by the audience Ali flavored the cloth, and could therefore taste for the correct one as he brought them up. Ali also swallowed live goldfish, watches, coins, costume jewelry, paper money, peach pits, stones, live mice, buttons, pool balls and other odd objects. In another standard performance segment, he placed eight or more lit cigarettes in his mouth but instead of inhaling, he swallowed the smoke and, after a significant time had passed, issued it forth in a steady stream like an erupting volcano. Ali's longstanding finale was the swallowing of copious amounts of water again, but this time followed by a pint of kerosene. A prop was then produced, typically a model castle or house made of metal set on a table, within which a small flame burned. Lighter than water and immiscible with it, the kerosene floated above the liquid in Ali's gut, allowing him to disgorge it first. The stage thus set, and to a drum roll or an imitation of fire bells, Ali became a \\"human flamethrower\\", spewing the accelerant in a long stream over the sacrificial prop, setting it ablaze. Once the kerosene was exhausted, the water followed, streaming out his mouth in a long flow from up to six feet away, extinguishing the fire. At some performances, a panel or \\"jury\\" from the audience was invited on stage to verify that no trick mechanism was being employed‚Äîthat he was actually swallowing the items in question and delivering them back through acts of regurgitation. Sometimes Ali would stroll into the audience during his nut swallowing trick. His stomach exposed by his standard costume, he invited audience members to pat his stomach, allowing them to hear the nuts rattling within. One newspaper reported that Ali's feats, essentially controlled vomiting, were performed in \\"a manner without the least bit of unpleasantness or anything bordering on repulsiveness.\\" Not everyone felt the same: at least one of Ali's engagements was cut short once the proprietor realized that the nature of the act \\"was killing their supper shows\\". Famed escapologist and magician Harry Houdini remarked in his 1920 work Miracle Mongers and Their Methods that water spouting was a \\"performance that could not fail to disgust a modern audience.\\" The abilities of Ali fascinated the public and medical authorities. As reported in a 1928 Sheboygan Press article, at one of Ali's acts a number of doctors attended and thoroughly examined him during the performance. They came away satisfied that he was actually imbibing and regurgitating the material and objects as claimed, but remained \\"mystified over his extraordinary performance.\\" According to an article appearing in the Naugatuck Daily News, \\"Physicians of three continents have puzzled over the gastronomical mechanism of this human ostrich without success. X-ray experiments have been made during his exhibition without a plausible explanation forthcoming that satisfies the critical, in fact, the profession of surgery has thrown up its hands in amazement over this human ostrich.\\" Film appearances Ali's act was captured in two films: the 1930 short Strange as It Seems, and Politiquerias (1931), the expanded Spanish-language version of Laurel and Hardy's Chickens Come Home. Ali also had a bit part as the \\"Turkish landlord\\" in Warner Bros.' 1932 film Scarlet Dawn starring Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Nancy Carroll. Two documentaries contain footage of Ali taken from Politiquerias: 1977's Gizmo!, and 1999's Vaudeville, a documentary produced by KCTS-TV that exhibits 90 vaudeville acts over a two- hour running time. The documentary has since aired on the Public Broadcasting Service's American Masters series numerous times. Speaking about the democratic nature of the vaudeville performance circuit, Vaudeville's writer and executive producer said in reference to Ali that the film \\"embraced everything from Caruso to a guy who threw up.\\" By contrast, in episode 30 of the Sundance Channel television program Iconoclasts, magician David Blaine speaks enthusiastically of Ali. During the episode, Blaine shows artist Chuck Close Ali's kerosene and water finale footage from Politiquerias and comments that Ali is his \\"favorite magician ... it's real but nobody's been able to do it since ... his name was Hadji Ali ... he's my favorite of all time.\\" Death Ali died on November 5, 1937, in Wolverhampton, England, from heart failure during a bout of bronchitis. Even before his death, a rumor had circulated that the Rockefeller Institute sought to procure Ali's stomach upon his death, and would pay as much as $50,000 for it. This claim appeared in a poster advertising Ali's impending appearance at a theater during his lifetime. After Ali's death was reported, the rumor resurfaced as an active offer of $10,000. When a Rockefeller Institute manager was interviewed about the story, he said the offer had never been made but that nevertheless, \\"we should very much like to see the body.\\" Almina and Julian transported Ali's body back to the United States on board the Queen Mary. According to a November 29, 1937 article in the New York Post, upon their arrival, Almina offered her father's body to Maryland's Johns Hopkins University for investigation by surgeons, after which it would be transported to Egypt for interment in a mausoleum. However, The Afro-American newspaper reported on December 11, 1937, that Johns Hopkins' officials had declined the offer.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. History The church was built between 1843 and 1855. It was paid for by Sir Uvedale Price and his son Sir Robert Price. The church cost ¬£3,883 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). Its main architect was George Moore, and the rector Rev R. L. Freer designed the spire and fittings inside the church. The church was built to replace an older church sited \\"a field away\\", whose churchyard contains the war grave of a World War II Royal Artillery soldier. Architecture =Exterior= St Mary's is constructed in sandstone with Welsh slate roofs. Its plan is cruciform, with an apsidal chancel at the west end, and a tower at the east end containing a porch. The nave is in three bays, with single-bay north and south transepts. The tower is in two stages, with gabled buttresses. Its lower stage is \\"extremely tall\\". The upper stage contains two-lancet bell openings. Above these is a cornice supported on a corbel table, and an octagonal broach spire. On the spire are two tiers of lucarnes and a finial with a wrought iron cross. Fours steps lead to a doorway on the east side of the tower. On each side of the nave there are three lancet windows, and between them are buttresses. On the north and south sides of the transepts are three stepped lancet windows, and on the east sides are single blind lancets. On the west side of both transepts is a small porch, each of which contains a pair of rectangular windows. Under the windows of the north porch, a doorway leads down to a crypt. In the apse of the chancel are five lancet windows. On the apex of the chancel gable is an elaborate wrought iron cross in a circle. Along the sides of the porch in the base of the tower are stone benches. =Interior= The ceiling contains decorations including a pair of carved wooden angels, and a large boss above the chancel steps. There is much painting in the chancel, including the corbels, under which there are stripes in different colours. Around the chancel is a painted plaster dado which includes eight rows of rampant lions. Beneath each of the apse windows is a metal plaque; these contain inscriptions of the Magnificat, the Creed, the Ten Commandments, the Lord's Prayer, and the Nunc Dimittis. Above the central wall of the apse is a carved oak canopy. Between the nave and the transepts are carved oak screens. The walls of the nave are plastered but uncoloured. The pulpit is incorporated within the southern screen; it is polygonal and supported on a carved corbel. Above it is a tester decorated with the emblems of the Four Evangelists. The font probably dates from the 15th century, and consists of an octagonal bowl on an octagonal base. The stained glass in the five windows of the apse is by William Warrington and dates from about 1845. The central window contains depictions of the Ascension, the Crucifixion, and the Resurrection. In the south window is the Annunciation and the Nativity, and the north window contains the Magi, and the scene of a miracle. The windows between them contain the emblems of the Four Evangelists. The stained glass in the transept windows dates from 1866 and consists of grisaille, blue squares and red triangles. The windows at the west end of the nave commemorate Foxley family weddings in 1866; that on the north side depicts Ruth, and the window on the south side shows the Marriage at Cana. Both windows were made by Heaton, Butler and Bayne. The memorials include monuments to Sir Uvedale Price, his son, Sir Robert, who died in 1857, and Rev Freer. The two-manual organ was made in 1845 by Gray and Davison, but when it was surveyed in 2000 it was unplayable.

He is also one of the founders of the Tilganga Institute of Ophthalmology. For his work in taking quality, life-transforming cataract surgery to the poorest, he has been referred to as the \\"God of Sight\\". In 1994, Ruit helped found the Tilganga Institute of Ophthalmology, which provides free treatment to those who cannot afford to pay. It manufactures high-quality intraocular lenses for surgery at a fraction of the price of its previous manufacturing cost. The extremely low cost of these lenses have made quality cataract surgeries affordable to the poorest population. Ruit was awarded the prestigious Ramon Magsaysay Award for Peace and International Understanding, considered to be the Asian equivalent of the Nobel Prize, for \\"placing Nepal at the forefront of developing safe, effective, and economical procedures for cataract surgery, enabling the needlessly blind in even the poorest countries to see again.\\" In 2018, the Government of India awarded him the Padma Shri, its fourth highest civilian award, for ‚Äú[his] innovation in the 1980s [that] led to a 90 percent reduction in the cost of cataract eye surgery, provides low-cost cataract surgery lenses to over thirty countries.‚Äù His biography The Barefoot Surgeon, authored by Australian writer Ali Gripper, was published in June 2018. This biography's Nepali translation version 'Sanduk Ruit' was published by Fine Print Books in 2019. Early life and education Ruit was born on September 4, 1954, to rural, illiterate parents in the remote mountainous village Olangchunggola in the border with Tibet in Taplejung district of northeast Nepal. His village was a tiny cluster of 200 people, located 11,000 feet above the sea level, on the lap of the world's third-highest peak Mt. Kanchenjunga. It is one of the remotest regions of Nepal with no electricity, no school, no health facility, or modern means of communication, and lies blanketed under snow for six to nine months a year. Ruit's family made a subsistence living from small agriculture, petty trading and livestock farming. Ruit was the second of his parents‚Äô four children. But he lost his three siblings ‚Äì elder brother to diarrhea at age three and younger sister Chundak to fever at age eight. In many interviews, Ruit has mentioned that for him, the most painful was his younger sister Yangla's death. Yangla was his childhood companion, and he was to develop a special bond with her over the years. But she tragically died at a young age of 15 due to tuberculosis as the family was too poor to afford the best treatment available which could have saved her life. In many interviews, Ruit has said that this loss made a strong mark on him and instilled in him a resolve to become a doctor and work for the poor who would not otherwise have access to healthcare. The nearest school from his village was eleven days' walk away in Darjeeling. His father, a small-time businessman, placed a priority on providing education to his children, and sent Ruit to St Robert's School in Darjeeling, and provided financial support for his early medical career. In 1969, Ruit graduated from Siddhartha Vanasthali School in Kathmandu, Nepal, and later was further educated in India, He studied MBBS from King George's Medical College, Lucknow from 1972 to 1976, further studies from 1981 at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi. He also studied in the Netherlands, Australia, and the United States, and was mentored by ophthalmologist Professor Fred Hollows. Accomplishments Working in Australia in 1986, Ruit and Fred Hollows developed a strategy for using inexpensive intraocular lenses to bring small-incision cataract surgery to the developing world. However, the lenses remained too expensive for many cataract patients. In 1995 Ruit developed a new intraocular lens that could be produced far more cheaply and which, as of 2010, is used in over 60 countries. Ruit's method is now taught in U.S. medical schools. Despite being far cheaper, Ruit's method has the same success rate as western techniques: 98% at six months. In 1994 Ruit and The Fred Hollows Foundation founded the Tilganga Eye Center, now called the Tilganga Institute of Ophthalmology, in Kathmandu. Tilganga has performed over 90,000 operations and trained over 500 medical personnel from around the world, and produces Ruit's intraocular lenses at a cost of less than US$5 each. It also produces prosthetic eyes for US$3, compared to imports that cost $150. For those unable to reach the Center, or who live in otherwise isolated rural areas, Ruit and his team set up mobile eye camps, often using tents, classrooms, and even animal stables as makeshift operating rooms. After treating a North Korean diplomat in Kathmandu, Ruit persuaded North Korean authorities to let him visit in 2006. There he conducted surgery on 1000 patients and trained many local surgeons.

It is located at the Madhab village of Niali block in Cuttack district, Odisha. Architecture The Temple is built in pancharatha design. Three buildings, namely Vimana, Jagamohana and Natamandapa. The Vimana is of Rekha Deula, Jagamohana is of Pidha deula and the Natamandapa is flat-roofed and recently renovated by Archaeological Survey of India. The motifs are of different serpents, naayikas, devatas etc. The temple belongs to 13th century and was built by Eastern Ganga dynasty. The architecture of this temple is very much similar to that of Sakshigopal Temple of Puri and Ananta Vasudev temple of Bhubaneswar. You can find the images of Dasa-Avatar of Vishnu, a big Sudarshan Chakra made up of Black granite stone and also the image of Ananta Sayana of lord Vishnu in the walls of Jagamohana and Natamandapa. The outer walls of the temple are carved with beautiful old Pauranic images from Krishna Lila & Mahabharata. Some erotic carvings can also be found on the outer wall of the temple. The Deity The central icon Madhava who is a rare image. The upper left arm holds Gada, lower left Sudarshana Chakra, upper right full blown Lotus and lower right Shankha. In the Jagamohana a rare image of Durga is found. She is worshipped as the sister of Madhava. Many festivals like Janmashtami, Ekadashi and special festivals in Maagha and Vaishakha month are observed here. The main attraction here is the very old idol of Garuda which is made of black sandstone. Etymology of the name Maadhava The Sanskrit bhashya of Vishnu Sahasranama by Adi Shankara says that Paramatma is the owner of Maaya or illusion. And later explanation by Sri Vaishnava scholars say Lakshmi is called Maaya and his husband is Vishnu, so he is Maadhava.(‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä, ‡§§‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ß‡§µ‡§É ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§ß‡§µ‡§É ‡§á‡§§‡§ø ). Most simply, Madhava is a form of lord Vishnu or Krishna. Location & Other Issues It is located at Madhab Village of Niali block in Cuttack district.Regular bus services run from Bhubaneswar and Cuttack to Niali. Although, it has rich architecture of traditional Kalinga style. it is being neglected by the Government. It is not included under the projects of Odisha tourism.

Since 1994, together with the Metropolitan Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist of Badajoz, it is the seat of the Archdiocese of M√©rida-Badajoz.  History  M√©rida was founded in the 25 BC, with the name of Emerita Augusta, by order of Emperor Augustus, to protect a pass and a bridge over the Guadiana river. The city became one of the most important cities in the Roman empire. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, during the Visigothic period, the city maintained much of its splendor, especially under the 6th century domination of the bishops of Emerita, when it was the capital of Hispania. The see of the bishopric of Emerita was \\"Church of Saint Mary of Jerusalem\\" (). In 713 M√©rida was conquered by the Muslim army under Musa bin Nusair but it is not until 28 February 1119 that the metropolitan see of the Bishops of Emerita was transferred to Santiago de Compostela by the bull of Pope Calixtus II.Official website of the co-cathedral of M√©rida The city returned under Christians hands in 1230, when it was conquered by Alfonso IX of Le√≥n. The city was attached to the Archdiocese of Santiago de Compostela. The construction began on a chapel dedicated to Virgin Mary on the ruins of the Visigothic cathedral. In 1479, Don Alonso de C√°rdenas, Master of the Order of Santiago, ordered the extension of the chapel with the intention to make it the main church of the city. In 1620, a bull of Pope Paul V creates the title of titular bishop of M√©rida. The bishop was chosen among the priests of the Order of Santiago, that chose the church of Santa Mar√≠a as see of their bishopric. On 28 July 1994 Pope John Paul II established the Archdiocese of M√©rida-Badajoz, making the Church of Saint John Baptist his metropolitan cathedral and co-cathedral the church of Saint Mary Major of M√©rida.. Description =Exterior= The cathedral includes three decorated doors. La Portada de Santa Maria, which opens to the Plaza de Espa√±a, consists of a lintelled body on which stands a vaulted shrine, framed by two columns with Corinthian capitals, which house a statue of Nuestra Se√±ora de la Gu√≠a. The current shrine was erected in 1766 on a preexisting 16th century one, commanded to be erected by Francisco Moreno de Almaraz, Peruvian conqueror. The Puerta del Perd√≥n, on the eastern side of the church, faces the Plaza de Santa Maria. It is an 18th-century neoclassical fa√ßade, the work of Mateo S√°nchez Villaviciosa. It consists of two parts: the bottom, contains double pillars hewn in the Ionic style and the top has corinthian fluted pillars framing the shields of M√©rida and the Order of Santiago. Above it rises the bell tower, with a square base and in which there is a 16th-century music box with 10 bells and a clock of incalculable historic and artistic value, comparable only in Spain to the Cathedral of Santo Domingo de la Calzada. The Puerta del Norte was recently reinforced after restoration work done on the Cathedral. =Interior= The cathedral is rectangular in shape and consists of three naves (the central one is two times wider than the lateral ones), separated by square pillars, with a detached column on each face upon which pointed arches are alighted. The roof of the auditoriums was originally of a Mudejar style ceiling but is now vault shaped. The High Altar consists of two sections. Covered with a vault of tierceron, the first is on a rectangular base and the second on a spectrum, with keys decorated with a rosette plant and the Mystic Lamb. On both sides of the presbytery, under arcosoliums, the tombs in alabaster of Don Diego de Vera Mendoza, of the Order of Santiago and his wife Do√±a Marina Gomez de Figueroa can be admired. The central apse is decorated with a large altarpiece from 1762, which two bodies surround a 13th-century window. Floor plan of the Cathedral:1. High altar; 2. The Blessed Sacrament Chapel; 3. Altar of the Sant√≠simo Cristo de las Injurias; 5. Chapel of Our Lord Jesus Christ or of the Mendoza; 6. Old Sacristy; 7. House of Sexton; 8. Bautisto chapel or the Baptistery; 10. Altar of Our Father Jesus of Medina; 11. Chapel of Our Lady of the Forsaken or of the Vera; 12. Chapel and Dressing room of Nuestra Se√±ora de la Guia; 13. Chapel of San Antonio; 14. Chapel of the Conde de la Roca - Chapter Hall. The central vaulted niche of the second body, which rests on a pedestal base, is occupied by an image of the Virgin Mary, accompanied by the Apostles Peter and Paul and the local Saints Eulalia and Julia. Among the apsidal chapels, the Chapel of the Epistola, of the Earls of la Roca, is the most notable. It is divided into two sections and both covered with ribbed vaults, decorated with their shield. =Works of art= The church's interior cathedral contains works of art of great value, including the following: * Sculpture of Cristo de la O. (mid-16th century) * Sculpture of the Sant√≠simo Cristo de las Injurias. * Sculpture of the Immaculate Conception * Altar supporter from the Visigothic period.

Between its debut in 2003, and an update to the agreement in late 2018, more than 53 million people had used Free File\\"IRS, Free File Alliance announce changes to improve program\\" https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-free-file-alliance-announce-changes-to- improve-program-improved-taxpayer-options-available-for-2019-free-file-program  History  In November 2001, the U.S. Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) Quicksilver Task Force established 24 e-government initiatives that were a part of the President's Management Agenda. These initiatives were designed to improve Government to Government, Government to Business, and Government to Citizen electronic capabilities. One initiative, IRS Free File, instructed the IRS to provide free and secure online tax return preparation and filing services to taxpayers. In accordance with this OMB directive, the IRS began working in partnership with the tax software industry to develop a solution. The result was the formation of the Free File Alliance, LLC, a group of tax software companies who provide free commercial online tax preparation and electronic filing services. According to investigations by ProPublica,The TurboTax Trap: How the Tax Prep Industry Makes You Pay TurboTax maker Intuit has engaged in practices that hide the Free File program from eligible taxpayers, and attempt to trick eligible taxpayers into paying for services they could get for free. In response, in 2019 the IRS prohibited participating companies from hiding Free File pages from search engines, and removed the rules that prevent the IRS from offering a competing web site for no-charge filing.  Free File Alliance  The Free File Alliance is a consortium of 12 commercial tax preparation software providers who offer their brand-name tax software products for free. Each member is allowed to set eligibility requirements for their software products. However, the cumulative offers must allow 70 percent of U.S. taxpayers - approximately 100 million people - to be eligible for at least one product. Each year, the income limit for eligibility is adjusted to reach 70 percent of the taxpayers. The income limit for 2020 is set at $69,000. Agreements between the IRS and the Free File Alliance are publicly available. The latest Memorandum of Understanding was signed in 2015 and runs through 2020.  Free File Software  One component of Free File is the Free File Software program, which allows lower-income tax payers to use name-brand tax preparation software to prepare and file tax forms for free. For 2020, anyone whose adjusted gross income is $69,000 or less will be eligible for at least one software product. There are 12 products from which to choose. Each software provider sets its own eligibility requirements, generally related to income, state residency, age, military service or eligibility for the earned income tax credit. Free File is free for federal tax returns only. However, some Free File Alliance members offer state return software for a fee or for free. Most of the software products, but not all, use an interview format in which you are asked questions and your answers are used to populate the electronic form. This format helps taxpayers get the tax credits and deductions they are due. It also means taxpayers do not have to be experts in income tax law. Alliance members cannot sell any refund anticipation loan products through the Free File service. Alliance members are limited in the number of times they can offer to sell other products. To use IRS Free File, taxpayers must go through the IRS website at www.irs.gov/freefile. There, taxpayers can find a tax software product one of two ways. They can review a list of companies and their offers. Or, they can use a simple web tool that asks a few questions - such as income, state residency and age - and the tool will locate those software products for which taxpayers are eligible. Once a taxpayer chooses a product, they will be directed off the IRS.gov site and onto the Alliance member's website to complete their federal tax return.  Free File Fillable Forms  Another component of Free File is Free File Fillable Forms, which is available to all taxpayers, including taxpayers whose incomes are greater than $69,000. It is an alternative to Free File Software, although both are free. Free File Fillable Forms is operated by a private organization, the Free File Alliance and not the IRS. Though IRS links to it, they do not endorse it or any product.https://www.freefilefillableforms.comBefore Starting Free File Fillable Forms https://www.irs.gov/e-file-providers/before-starting-free-file- fillable-forms Free File: Do Your Federal Taxes for Free https://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-freeFree File Fillable Forms General FAQs https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/2012_4f_faqs.pdf \\"IRS, Free File Alliance announce changes to improve program\\" https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-free-file-alliance-announce-changes-to- improve-program-improved-taxpayer-options-available-for-2019-free-file-program Free File Fillable Forms is an electronic version of IRS paper forms.

It was first published in October 2010; the English translation by Richard Dixon appeared a year later. Shortlisted for the Independent Foreign Fiction Prize in 2012, it has been described as Eco's best novel since The Name of the Rose. Plot summary The main character is Simone Simonini, a man whom Eco claims he has tried to make into the most cynical and disagreeable character in all the history of literatureInterview with Paul Holdengr√§ber, New York Public Library: 8 November 2011 (and is the only fictional character in the novel). He was born in Turin in 1830. His mother died while he was still a child and his father was killed in 1848 fighting for a united Italy. He is brought up by his grandfather, an old reactionary who houses Jesuit refugees and hates the Jews ‚Äî he claims that the French Revolution was planned by the Knights Templar, the Bavarian Illuminati and the Jacobins, but behind them all, he says, were the Jews. Simonini imbibes his grandfather's antisemitism, but his father's radicalism, and his dislike of the Jesuits, also arouse his anti- clerical inclinations. In the works of French writers such as Eugene Sue and Alexandre Dumas he enjoys reading of intrigues and conspiracies, and aspires to emulate these fictions in his own life. Simonini studies law. After his grandfather's death he is employed by a dishonest lawyer who teaches him the art of forgery. His skills bring him to the attention of the Piedmont Government secret service who decide his skills might be useful to them. His first big coup is to act as an agent provocateur, betraying to the police a group of radical students who were his drinking buddies. In exchange, the secret service helps him betray his employer, get him thrown in prison where he soon dies, and take over his business. Giuseppe Garibaldi with his \\"Thousand\\" red shirts invades Sicily in 1860 and Simonini is sent to Palermo as a spy to report on Garibaldi's movements after he has taken possession of the Island. While on this mission, Simonini discovers that, contrary to circulating rumours, Garibaldi's Thousand are students, independent artisans, and professionals; they are not peasants. The support given by Sicilian peasants is not a matter of patriotism, but of hatred of exploiting landlords and oppressive Neapolitan officials. Garibaldi himself has no interest in social revolution, and instead sides with the Sicilian landlords against the rioting peasants. The Kingdom of Piedmont cautiously supports the unification of Italy but is worried that Garibaldi's fame might eclipse that of their king, Vittorio Emanuele, or worse still, that he might proclaim a republic. He meets the French novelist Alexandre Dumas and Italian patriots Nino Bixio and Ippolito Nievo. Simonini is ordered to destroy some heavily guarded documents in Nievo's possession. He befriends Nievo to gain his confidence - but the papers are too closely guarded. The only way Simonini can think of is to blow up the ship on which Nievo is sailing - sending the papers, Nievo himself and dozens of others to the deeps. Simonini develops an elaborate scheme to smuggle aboard a deranged malcontent with a box of explosives, and bribes a sailor to take part in the scheme, knowing that they would both be killed along with everybody else on the boat. Simonini then stabs to death an accomplice on land who had provided the explosive, to silence him. However, Simonini's secret service employers are far from pleased - he has gone too far and greatly exceeded his brief, and the affair arouses suspicion and makes the government of the new United Italy look bad. Fortunately for Simonini, his employers are not as ruthless as he is himself. Rather than being permanently silenced, he is banished to Paris and given an introduction to the secret service of Emperor Napoleon the Third. He arrives there in 1861, where the remainder of the story is set. Here he sets up business forging documents in rooms over a junk shop near Place Maubert. He also works for the French secret service as a forger and fixer. Over the next thirty-five years he lays traps for revolutionaries fighting against Napoleon III, provides intelligence during the days of the Paris Commune and forges the bordereau that would trigger the Dreyfus affair. All of this earns him enough to pay the bills and to indulge his passion for fine food, but he wants to retire on a decent pension. He hatches a plan to forge what will one day become the infamous Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a document that claims the Jews were plotting world dominion. Simonini's idea is first inspired by an account of a masonic gathering in Alexandre Dumas's novel Joseph Balsamo, and he gradually embroiders it using other sources, each inspired by the other ‚Äî Eug√®ne Sue's Les Myst√®res du Peuple, Maurice Joly's The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu and a novel called Biarritz by a Prussian secret agent called Hermann Goedsche who used Sir John Retcliffe as a nom de plume. Most of the novel is in the form of a diary written by Simone Simonini in 1897. He wakes up one morning to find he has lost his memory and suspects something terrible has happened. A few years earlier, at his regular eating place, Chez Magny, he had met a young doctor studying at the Salp√™tri√®re Hospital whose name, he seems to recall, was \\"Fro√Øde\\" (\\"or something like that\\"). He had told him about talking cures as a means of overcoming traumatic experiences. Simonini decides to write down all he can remember in the form of a diary, in the hope of regaining his memory. Simonini works long hours on his life story, falling asleep through exhaustion or an excess of wine. Each time he wakes he discovers that someone has been adding notes to his diary, a mysterious Abb√© Dalla Piccola, who seems to know far too much about Simonini's life. Dalla Piccola has his own story to tell involving Palladism, Freemasonry, devil worship and the Catholic Church, and introduces further historical characters, including Saint Th√©r√®se of Lisieux, Yuliana Glinka, Pyotr Rachkovsky, Diana Vaughan and one of the greatest hoaxers of the 19th century, L√©o Taxil. The peak of Simonini's career is composing what would become The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, refining and extending many earlier fabrications supposedly documenting a conspiratorial meeting for world domination which was said to have taken place at the Old Jewish Cemetery of Prague (in fact, the earliest such document which Simonini wrote, back in his Italian days, depicted the conspirators as Jesuits rather than Jews). After this document is handed over to representatives of the Czar's Secret Police, they pressure Simonini to place a bomb in the newly dug tunnel of the Paris Metro, which could be blamed on \\"the Jews\\" and flash out the assertions of The Protocols. Simonini obtains from an old Italian expatriate revolutionary living in Paris a powerful time bomb and instructions on how to use it - wherupon his diary is abruptly cut off. Presumably, Simonini blew himself up, though the omniscient narrator appearing in other parts of the book remains silent on this. Historical background According to Eco, \\"the characters of this novel are not imaginary. Except the main character, they all lived in reality, including his grandfather,On Giovanni Battista Simonini, see Reinhard Markner: \\"Giovanni Battista Simonini: Shards from the Disputed Life of an Italian Anti-Semite\\", in: Kesarevo Kesarju. Scritti in onore di Cesare G. De Michelis. A cura di Marina Ciccarini, Nicoletta Marcialis e Giorgio Ziffer. Firenze 2014, pp. 311-319 author of the mysterious message to abbot Barruel which gave rise to all modern anti-Semitism\\". Eco goes on to say: Eco infuses the novel with other books as it explores the 19th-century novels that were plagiarized in the Protocols of Zion, and is structured like one.\\"Umberto Eco: 'People are tired of simple things. They want to be challenged'\\", Stephen Moss, The Guardian, 27 November 2011. The spirit of the novel is Alexandre Dumas, in particular an intertextuality with his novel Joseph Balsamo (1846). In several passages, various 19th Century antisemites use the term \\"Final Solution\\" as referring to the total extermination of all Jews, and also use the infamous term \\"Arbeit Macht Frei\\" which would appear on the gate of Auschwitz. After completing The Protocols of The Elders of Zion, Simonini speaks with certainty of the fact that this book would eventually lead to the extermination of the Jews - though it would happen after his lifetime and he would not have to do it himself. Such explicit anticipations of the Nazi-led Holocaust are an obvious anachronism, consciously and deliberately put in by Eco.

More importantly, however, he was the major force for the development of a modernistic movement in painting in Burma, which began in the early 1960s. In 1952, Khin Maung became a bank manager, and thus he is often referred to as Khin Maung (Bank) to differentiate him from another Burmese painter Khin Maung (Yangon). The names of both Khin Maung (Bank) and Khin Maung (Yangon) are sometimes spelled as \\"Khin Maung\\". Life Khin Maung (Bank) was born in 1910 at Tantse (), Shwebo District, the second son of a merchant, and became interested in painting at an early age. He began his formal training through a correspondence course from the London-based Press Art School in 1933. In 1934, he took further correspondence courses from (Pyinmana) U Hla and the London School of Fine Arts. He started drawing cartoons and commercial paintings in 1935. He was interested in modern art and graphic art, and after World War II first began teaching these subjects to two young Mandalay artists, Win Pe and Paw Oo Thet, who would both, in turn, have a great impact on the movement in modernistic painting in Burma. He wrote and gave workshops about modern art, explaining the principles to other artists. In the 1960s, when a movement in modernistic painting began to bloom for the first time in Burma, he exhibited his works in Rangoon, as his students Paw Oo Thet and Win Pe and many other painters with modernistic inclinations were also doing. Along with Bagyi Aung Soe, he is considered one of the founders of modernistic art in Myanmar, but it is very likely that Khin Maung's interest preceded Aung Soe's as he was roughly 15 years older than Aung Soe and there is evidence that his first fully conceived work of modernistic painting occurred as early as 1945 or 1946. In Southeast Asian terms, this would roughly put him on par in time with painters such as Affandi in Indonesia, who were turning to modernistic painting during the same decade. With respect to Burma, Khin Maung may be accurately called the \\"Father of Modernistic Painting\\" there. Khin Maung helped organize art exhibitions in Mandalay and Yangon, and in 1971 he was one of the founders of Lokanat Galleries, an early art gallery in Yangon which is still active today. He worked closely with other Mandalay artists such as Aye Kyaw, Ba Thet and Aung Khin. Khin Maung died on 20 December 1983 in Mandalay. Work Khin Maung's painting techniques were influenced by European theories and techniques, derived initially from the British artists in Myanmar during the colonial era. He is known, for instance, to have done early paintings in the British Watercolor School style, which his Mandalay predecessors, Ba Zaw, Saya Saung, and Ba Thet, were fond of (though Ba Thet would ultimately rebel against this style). Later, he became intensely interested in the 20th century European and American movements in modernistic painting. His work was not aggressively modernistic, but it did show cubist and other vanguard influences. The most provocative aspect of Khin Maung's work, however, is that in searching for a modernistic idiom which would suit Burma and not disenchant the conservative tendencies of Burmese culture, he also deeply sought inspiration from the mural painting of Bagan, which was 800 years or so old. This leap in thought was rather brilliant, for it revealed to Burmese painters who were interested in modernising stagnant forms of painting in Burma, namely naturalism and realism, that they did not have to wholly mimic or entirely borrow from the outside world to do so. They could find plenty of inspiration for figurative or non-figurative abstraction in the history of Burmese art itself, in the ruins at Bagan.

These carriages have no connection to the British Rail Mark 4. History Along with the occasional cravens stocked train, the Dublin to Cork express was operated only with outdated slam-door British Rail Mark 2s and Mark 3s. Since only a limited amount of Mark 3 DVTs were available most services required a Locomotive shunt at the end of each trip. This resulted in an infrequent service with most services bunched in the morning and evening rush hours. Iarnr√≥d √âireann opted to extend the service to an hourly clockface departure in order to increase growth on the line. Initially, to eliminate the Locomotive shunt, interest was expressed in a long range Diesel Multiple Unit however, since Iarnr√≥d √âireann had a large fleet of High-Speed Diesel Locomotives which were less than ten years old, a Push-Pull train was chosen instead. Funding was procured from the European Union the Transport21 plan and an invitation to tender was put forward in 2001 and four companies qualified. In November 2002 the contract was awarded to Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles. Description 67 Mark 4 coaches were manufactured in 2004-2005 by CAF and delivered in 2006. The designs for the interior of the carriages and the exterior styling of the DVT were produced for CAF by Design Triangle.http://articles.janes.com/articles/Janes-World-Railways/Design- Triangle-MANUFACTURERS-AND-SERVICES--CONSULTANCY-SERVICES-United-Kingdom.html Capable of 10-car operation, each in-service set currently comprises 8 cars: *Generator Control Car - GC (or DVT) *One First Class - FC *One Catering Car - CC *Four Standard Class - SC *One Standard End - SCE, with retractable buffers & drop-head buckeye coupling at locomotive end. Seating capacity is 422 (8-car set), the DVT (driving van trailer) is recognised as a carriage and the train is fully accessible to mobility-impaired customers. The DVT Features a Yellow front end to ensure visibility and has a compartment towards the rear to carry Mail and Luggage. Main Features The Standard Class carriages have improved passenger seating and leg room. They also have electronic visual and audible passenger information systems, electronic seat reservation displays, CCTV, air conditioning and additional space for luggage. Power sockets are supplied on all Standard and Citygold Class coaches. Citygold cars have ergonomic, electronically adjustable seats, multi-channel ear phone jack sockets and individual overhead lighting.http://www.irishrail.ie/about-us/intercity Main features include: *Merak HVAChttps://web.archive.org/web/20090422011023/http://www.merak- sa.com/implantacion.htm *Power operated passenger doors *Fire resistance to BS 6553:1999 Cat 1B *Public address (PA) including automated announcements in Irish and English *Closed-circuit television (CCTV) recording, including a forward-facing camera in the DVT *LED Exterior & Interior Destination signs *Seat Reservation system with reserved seating LED displays above each passenger seat.

A possibility being considered is the replacement of the existing 201 with two power cars, one of which would be converted from the existing Generator Control Car. Replacement stock Since January 2016, six sets operate the Dublin-Cork route on an enhanced hourly clockface timetable. ICR's are used at quieter times of the day. The Mark 3 carriages, withdrawn in 2009, replaced the older Mark 2 carriages that previously operated mid-day Limerick, Galway and Waterford routes. The Mark 3s were in turn superseded by a new batch of 183 22000 Class in 2009. The first batch of these was delivered in early March 2007, while the final deliveries took place in 2012.

Bettendorf was primarily a starting pitcher over the course of his nine-season professional baseball career. He was a second-round draft selection in the 1979 Major League Baseball Draft by the New York Mets. After never advancing above Double-A in the Mets system, Bettendorf was drafted by the Oakland Athletics in the December 1983 Rule 5 draft. After making the A's major league roster, as is required under Rule 5, he made his first major league appearance on April 8, 1984 against the Boston Red Sox at the Oakland Coliseum, earning a save in three no-hit scoreless innings.https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/OAK/OAK198404080.shtml He would go on to pitch in a total of three games for the A's, giving up 5 runs in 9 innings.https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/betteje01.shtml On May 9, 1984, Bettendorf was traded back to the Mets for a conditional pick and immediately optioned to the Double-A Jackson Mets. He would not return to the majors. After a severe elbow injury in 1986 while pitching for the Double-A Columbus Astros, Bettendorf returned in 1987 to play with the Double-A Birmingham Barons, where he became a submarine pitcher, going 9‚Äì1 in 43 appearances (all in relief). That season he was named to the Southern League All-Star team (despite only 2 saves and a 4.55 ERA) and helped the Barons to the Southern League Championship series win before retiring from professional baseball.https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=betten001jef Advancing through primarily the Mets strong minor league organization of the late 70's/early 80's, Bettendorf earned five Minor League Championship rings and three Minor League All-Star selections over his career.

In philosophical logic, the logical hexagon (also called the hexagon of opposition) is a conceptual model of the relationships between the truth values of six statements. It is an extension of Aristotle's square of opposition. It was discovered independently by both Augustin Sesmat and Robert Blanch√©.N-opposition theory logical hexagon This extension consists in introducing two statements U and Y. Whereas U is the disjunction of A and E, Y is the conjunction of the two traditional particulars I and O.  Summary of relationships  The traditional square of opposition demonstrates two sets of contradictories A and O, and E and I (i.e. they cannot both be true and cannot both be false), two contraries A and E (i.e. they can both be false, but cannot both be true), and two subcontraries I and O (i.e. they can both be true, but cannot both be false) according to Aristotle‚Äôs definitions. However, the logical hexagon provides that U and Y are also contradictory.  Interpretations  The logical hexagon may be interpreted in various ways, including as a model of traditional logic, quantifications, modal logic, order theory, or paraconsistent logic. For instance, the statement A may be interpreted as \\"Whatever x may be, if x is a man, then x is white.\\" (x)(M(x) ‚Üí W(x)) The statement E may be interpreted as \\"Whatever x may be, if x is a man, then x is non-white.\\" (x)(M(x) ‚Üí ~W(x)) The statement I may be interpreted as \\"There exists at least one x that is both a man and white.\\" (‚àÉx)(M(x) & W(x)) The statement O may be interpreted as \\"There exists at least one x that is both a man and non-white.\\" (‚àÉx)(M(x) & ~W(x)) The statement Y may be interpreted as \\"There exists at least one x that is both a man and white and there exists at least one x that is both a man and non-white.\\" (‚àÉx)(M(x) & W(x)) & (‚àÉx)(M(x) & ~W(x)) The statement U may be interpreted as \\"One of two things, either whatever x may be, if x is a man, then x is white or whatever x may be, if x is a man, then x is non-white.\\" (x)(M(x) ‚Üí W(x)) w (x)(M(x) ‚Üí ~W(x)) = Modal logic = The logical hexagon may be interpreted as a model of modal logic such that * A is interpreted as necessity * E is interpreted as impossibility * I is interpreted as possibility * O is interpreted as 'not necessarily' * U is interpreted as non-contingency * Y is interpreted as contingency  Further extension  It has been proven that both the square and the hexagon, followed by a ‚Äúlogical cube‚Äù, belong to a regular series of n-dimensional objects called ‚Äúlogical bi-simplexes of dimension n.‚Äù The pattern also goes even beyond this.Moretti, Pellissier  See also  *Alessio Moretti *Jean-Yves B√©ziau, New Light on the Square of Oppositions and its Nameless Corner  References   Further reading  *Jean-Yves Beziau (2012), \\"The power of the hexagon\\", Logica Universalis 6, 2012, 1-43. *Blanch√© (1953) *Blanch√© (1957) *Blanch√© Structures intellectuelles (1966) *Gallais, P.: (1982) *Gottschalk (1953) *Kalinowski (1972) *Monteil, J.F.: The logical square of Aristotle or square of Apuleius.The logical hexagon of Robert Blanch√© in Structures intellectuelles.The triangle of Indian logic mentioned by J.M Bochenski.(2005) *Moretti (2004) *Moretti (Melbourne) *Pellissier, R.: \\" \\"Setting\\" n-opposition\\" (2008) *Sesmat (1951) *Smessaert (2009) Category:Inference Category:Conceptual models ","title":"Logical hexagon"},{"id":"29594554","text":"The Reformed Evangelical Church of Indonesia (; ), abbreviated GRII, also Indonesian Reformed Evangelical Church, is a Reformed Christian church that is headquartered in Jakarta, Indonesia. It was founded by Stephen Tong, a Chinese-born Indonesian evangelist. The church's members are mainly Indonesians of Chinese descent.Ethnic Chinese in Contemporary Indonesia, p. 112 History Andrew Gih of the Evangelize China Fellowship established the Southeast Bible Seminary in Malang, East Java in 1952, and Tong graduated from it in 1961, establishing the church in 1989 following many years of preaching and evangelism. = Timeline = *In 1974 Tong conducts seminars in Surabaya and 2 years later become a guest lecturer in China Evangelical Seminary. *Later in 1984 turned to Jakarta to uphold the Spirit of Reformed and Evangelical theology. Two years later in 1986 he was the co-founder of Reformed Evangelical School of Theology in Jakarta and Surabaya, and library and printing station that provides Christian Books. *In 1989 Tong founded the Institute of Reformed Evangelical Indonesia the LRII, which become Gereja Reformed Injili Indonesia. *1991 - 2007 Tong serves as Rector in the Reformed Evangelical Divinity School in indonesia *In 1996 Stephen Tong become the chairman of the church Synod and in 1998 heserved as a Rector in The Reformed Institute in Indonesia *In 2008 Tong received an honorary degree from Westminster Theological Seminary in Philadelphia, PA. Stephen Tong founded the Reformed Evangelical Church of Indonesia in 1989 to establish a Reformed theology-based church and congregations who are committed to evangelism. The GRII is headquartered in the Reformed Millennium Center, in Sawah Besar, Jakarta, where it has its largest church, the Messiah Cathedral. It has congregations in other major cities in Indonesia, as well as in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Australia, China, Taiwan, Germany and the USA. Beliefs The church subscribes to the Reformed confessions generally accepted by Reformed churches, but it has its own unique confession of faith. Some churches use the Westminster Confession of Faith and the Heidelberg Catechism. Church organization Stephen Tong is currently the Head of Synod of the Reformed Evangelical Church of Indonesia. The Reformed Evangelical Church of Indonesia and its affiliated institutions have female evangelists, lecturers, and church council members. They are allowed to preach and assume authoritative roles, although they are not ordained. * Benyamin Intan, pastor, is a member of the Board of Directors for the World Reformed Fellowship. *FIRES (Fellowship of Indonesian Reformed Evangelical Students) lead by Preacher Edward Oei. *STEMI (Stephen Tong Evangelistic Ministries International) lead by Preacher Stephen Tong as movement to reach international community in Christ.  Recent issues  Stephen Tong has preached the Gospel to 1,5 million Indonesians in 2012. According to the International Evangelism Fellowship's adaptation of the press release by the Indonesian Evangelical Reformed Church till November 2012 the Reformed Evangelical Church's sermons have reached 1,5 millions. 700 preaching assemblies that was led by Stephen Tong were held. In October 200,000 people were able to hear the Gospel. The church reaped great evangelisation work in 2012. Indonesia is populated by about 250 million people, in which the majority are muslims. Thus, evangelisation there is a long process. As Pastor Tong noted, if the GRII preaches to 1 million people per year it would take 218 years for all Indonesians to hear the Gospel. Therefore, he urged the church to not be proud of its accomplishments, because there is great distance towards the evangelisation of the entire country. In a four-days evangelistic outreach in December 2012 Tong preached in the Messiah Cathedral in Jakarta to 30,000 attenders. On December 28, 2019 at the National Reformed Evangelical Convention (NREC), an annually held convention in Indonesia, Pastor Tong brought up an issue that the church was currently experiencing: a crisis of male servants to serve as sunday school teachers and a vacant of fatherly authority in children's life because Sunday school teachers are predominantly women. He called for the young generation, especially men, to surrender themselves as servants of God to serve as sunday school teachers in their respective churches. Worship center Messiah Cathedral, captured from Kemayoran Street. In 2008, a new building for the Reformed Evangelical Church in Jakarta called Reformed Millennium Center of Indonesia (RMCI), which includes The Messiah Cathedral (a 4800-seat auditorium), was finished. It took 16 years to persuade the Indonesian government to issue a permit to build the church. The church building was personally designed by Tong himself. It is one of the largest Chinese Christian evangelical church facilities in the world, with of space. In the Calvin auditorium, concerts were held in the opening of the Cathedral in 2008. The building also includes a theological seminary, STT Reformed Injili Internasional, founded by the Synod of Reformed Evangelical Church of Indonesia in cooperation with Reformed Institute for Christianity and the 21st Century (Stephen Tong Evangelistic Ministries International). The seminary has a strong relation with Westminster Theological Seminary. =Other centers= There are churches in Jakarta, Bandung, Yogyakarta, Semarang, Surabaya, Malang, Denpasar, Palembang, Medan, Batam, Samarinda, Singapore, Balikpapan, Kuala Lumpur, Melbourne, Sydney, Perth, Taipei, Taichung, Guangzhou, Beijing, Shanghai, Xiamen, Hong Kong, Berlin, Hamburg, M√ºnchen, Toronto, Boston, and Los Angeles.

The organizers of this concert interpret the name Djakarta as a symbol of a space to accommodate millions of souls from diverse backgrounds, both geographically and culturally. Moreover, Djakarta has become a place that is no longer synonymous with a particular ethnicity, religion, or skin color.  History  = Name Philosophy = The selection of employing the old spelling of Jakarta (i.e. Djakarta) in the concert's name aims to provide affirmation of the differences in the lifestyles of people in Jakarta over time. Hence, it intends to escape the impression that has been embedded in the word Jakarta as a dense, complicated, and exhausting city for its citizens. As for Artmosphere, it simply is the merging of the words Art and Atmosphere. Its goal is to capture an artistic mood, an aura of expression of the soul, a feeling that manifests itself to each individual in the room along with their local identities, and bringing sense, perspective, and culture from the place they came from to the place they now inhabit. In other words, it acts as a vessel holding a variety of flavors, making it a place of mingle between the diverse cultures of Indonesia. Djakarta Artmosphere slowly attempts to bring back the foundations of the spirit of equality in diversity using Music and Photography media. Djakarta Artmosphere 2009, with the theme \\"Egalitarian\\", marked the beginning of their long journey on interpreting such independence. Egalitarian represents a humble spirit: the spirit of respect for equality in the world of artistic diversity. = Early Success (Djakarta Artmosphere 2009) = In the year of 2009, Djakarta Artmosphere held their first event in the UpperRoom Jakarta, Annex Building. Their first show was a success: tickets were sold out with almost 2,000 people in attendance, despite the fact that the event was held on the same day as the Jak Jazz. = Tragedy In Padang = In 2009, an earthquake struck Padang leaving many people homeless.

It is registered common land owned by the Totteridge Manor AssociationTotteridge Manor Association home page and comprised the lands of the former Manor of Totteridge which were transferred to the association in 1954. Ecology The most interesting feature ecologically is a chain of old ponds. Starting from the east, they are Burnham's Pond, Warren Pond, Long Pond, Ellern Mede Pond and Pink Cottage Pond. They vary in character, but all have interesting wetland flora, and most are valuable for dragonflies, other invertebrates and amphibians. Plants to be found around the edges of the ponds include lesser spearwort, trifid bur- marigold and fool's watercress (Apium nodiflorum). In deeper water, white water-lily and curled and broad-leaved pondweeds can be found. Long Pond is used for angling. The common also has grassland, scattered trees, overgrown hedgerows and several pockets of scrubby woodland. The woodland is mainly composed of sycamore and elm. Other trees include two young native black poplar (Populus nigra ssp betulifolia), a rare tree in Britain and a priority species in the London Biodiversity Action Plan. There are also some fine mature oaks and horse-chestnuts scattered throughout the common. The grassland has a fairly good range of wild flowers, and damp areas near some of the ponds contain much tufted hair-grass.

It is a cluster of x86-64-servers running Oracle Linux or Solaris preinstalled. Its full trade mark is Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud (derived from the SI prefix exa- and -logic, probably from Weblogic), positioned by the vendor as a preconfigured clustered application server to use for cloud computing with elastic computing abilities.  History  Oracle Exadata and Exalogic Oracle Corporation announced Exalogic at the Oracle OpenWorld conference in San Francisco in September 2010. The company presented it as a continuation of the Oracle-engineered systems product-line which had started in 2008 with Exadata (preconfigured database cluster). Exalogic is a factory assembled 19-inch rack of 42 rack units, completed with servers and network equipment. There are 4 configurations, at different prices, depending on what fills the rack. The weight of the full rack is about 1 ton (more than 2000 lbs), a quarter rack weighs half as much.  Hardware  The hardware component of the X2-2 appliance consisted of: a group of 1-unit Intel Xeon servers, each equipped with two six-core 2.93 GHz processors and two solid- state drives for operating system and swap space; a common storage area network; and a set of InfiniBand and Ethernet switches. A full rack contains 30 server nodes, a half rack, 16, a quarter rack, 8, and an eighth rack, 4. Each server node has installed 96 GB of RAM, four 10 Gigabit Ethernet interfaces, and a double InfiniBand port. The storage area network for all configurations is similar, with 40 TB of raw space. The vendor's specifications and advertising content usually indicate the total parameters (360 processor kernels and 2.9 TB RAM for full rack). An X3-2 model was announced in 2012 with newer processors and more memory. Since late 2013 an X4-2 model is commercially available, it has yet more processor cores and four times as large capacity of solid-state drives. The latest version of Exalogic compute nodes have two Intel E5-2699v3 2.3 GHz Xeon (18-core) processors and eight 32 GB DDR4 2133 MHz RAM for a total of 256 GB per node. Two 400 GB SSDs (RAID1) and redundant power supplies  Software  Two 64-bit operating systems run on the server nodes of the appliance: Oracle Linux version 5.5 or Solaris 11. All servers have an installed cluster configuration of Oracle WebLogic Server and distributed memory cache Oracle Coherence. To run Java applications on a machine there is a choice of HotSpot or JRockit. Management of the appliance is available in the Oracle Enterprise Manager toolset, which is also pre-installed in the appliance. A transaction monitor Tuxedo is optionally supplied.

Retrieved 19 December 2011. On 19 October 2012, Geoffrey Counsell, the provider of a fireworks display, was charged with seven counts of manslaughter. At the 15 January hearing the manslaughter charges against Counsell were dropped. He will instead face a single charge of failing to ensure the safety of others, under health and safety laws. On 9 April he entered a not guilty plea and was bailed. On 10 December 2013, Geoffrey Counsell was cleared of the blame for the firework deaths. He had denied the charge of failing to ensure public safety for the Taunton Rugby Club display. A judge at Bristol Crown Court directed the jury to find him not guilty. The pile-up involved about 30 cars when they were engulfed by a thick fog on the M5 on 4 November 2011. Speaking outside court, Mr Counsell said he believed the decision to prosecute him was \\"motivated by a desire to find someone to blame for this terrible accident, simply for the sake of doing so\\". The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said it sought evidence from experts and eyewitnesses before making the decision to charge Mr Counsell. The court had previously been told the smog was so thick that motorists on the northbound carriageway likened it to having a tin of paint thrown over their windscreens. Mr Justice Simon ruled Mr Counsell had \\"no case to answer\\" following an application from the defendant's barrister at the halfway point in the trial. He said the prosecution's case was \\"heavily weighted\\" on \\"hindsight\\" and there was not sufficient evidence to show that Mr Counsell ought to have foreseen that smoke from the display could have drifted and mixed with fog to create thick smog. \\"I have therefore concluded that the evidence is such that the jury cannot continue in these circumstances and it is my duty to stop the trial and order an acquittal,\\" he added. Mr Counsell, who ran Firestorm Pyrotechnics, was the contractor hired by Taunton Rugby Club to run the ¬£3,000 display, which was watched by about 1,000 people.

The LRASM was intended to pioneer more sophisticated autonomous targeting capabilities than the U.S. Navy's current Harpoon anti-ship missile, which has been in service since 1977. The Navy was authorized by the Pentagon to put the LRASM into limited production as an operational weapon in February 2014 as an urgent capability stop-gap solution to address range and survivability problems with the Harpoon and to prioritize defeating enemy warships, which has been neglected since the end of the Cold War but taken on importance with the modernization of the Chinese People‚Äôs Liberation Army Navy. Competitors to Lockheed Martin protested the decision to award them a contract given the circumstances of selection and competition for the missile. The Navy responded by saying Lockheed's LRASM program was limited in scope, the decision to move ahead with them was made after an initial DARPA contract award, and that it was an urgent need to face future threats. The Navy will hold a competition for the Offensive Anti-Surface Warfare (OASuW)/Increment 2 anti-ship missile as a follow-on to LRASM to enter service in 2024. The OASuW Increment 2 competition will be completely open and start by FY 2017.US Navy plans competition for next-generation missile Reuters.com, 26 Mar 2014 It is expected the LRASM will compete against the joint Kongsberg/Raytheon offering of the Joint Strike Missile (JSM) for air-launch needs and an upgraded Raytheon Tomahawk cruise missile for surface-launch needs.Arming New Platforms Will Push Up Value Of Missiles Market - Aviationweek.com, 5 January 2015 In August 2015, the missile was officially designated AGM-158C.Lockheed Martin's LRASM Anti-Ship Missile Just Got its U.S. Navy Designation: AGM-158C - Navyrecognition.com, 24 August 2015. Design Unlike current anti-ship missiles the LRASM is expected to be capable of conducting autonomous targeting, relying on on-board targeting systems to independently acquire the target without the presence of prior, precision intelligence, or supporting services like Global Positioning Satellite navigation and data-links. These capabilities will enable positive target identification, precision engagement of moving ships and establishment of initial target cueing in extremely hostile environments. The missile will be designed with counter- countermeasures to evade hostile active defense systems. The LRASM is based on the AGM-158B JASSM-ER, but incorporates a multi-mode passive RF, a new weapon data-link and altimeter, and an uprated power system. It can be directed to attack enemy ships by its launch platform, receive updates via its datalink, or use onboard sensors to find its target. LRASM will fly towards its target at medium altitude then drop to low altitude for a sea skimming approach to counter anti-missile defenses. DARPA states its range is \\"greater than .\\" Although the LRASM is based on the JASSM-ER, which has a range of , the addition of the sensor and other features will somewhat decrease that range.Lockheed dishes 30m for key LRASM test - breakingdefense.com, 9 September 2013 It is estimated that the LRASM has a range of .US Navy‚Äôs New Anti-Ship Missile Makes Progress - Ainonline.com, 15 December 2015A Bridgehead Too Far? CSBA‚Äôs Aggressive, Risky Strategy For Marines - Breakingdefense.com, 15 November 2016 To ensure survivability to and effectiveness against a target, the LRASM is equipped with a BAE Systems-designed seeker and guidance system, integrating jam-resistant GPS/INS, an imaging infrared (IIR infrared homing) seeker with automatic scene/target matching recognition, a data-link, and passive Electronic Support Measure (ESM) and radar warning receiver sensors. Artificial intelligence software combines these features to locate enemy ships and avoid neutral shipping in crowded areas. Automatic dissemination of emissions data is classified, located, and identified for path of attack; the data-link allows other assets to feed the missile a real- time electronic picture of the enemy battlespace. Multiple missiles can work together to share data to coordinate an attack in a swarm. Aside from short, low-power data-link transmissions, the LRASM does not emit signals, which combined with the low-RCS JASSM airframe and low IR signature reduces detectability. Unlike previous radar-only seeker-equipped missiles that went on to hit other vessels if diverted or decoyed, the multi-mode seeker ensures the correct target is hit in a specific area of the ship. An LRASM can find its own target autonomously by using its passive radar homing to locate ships in an area, then using passive measures once on terminal approach.

The parade resulted in the police riot known as the Ponce massacre. Early years Casimiro Berenguer Padilla was born in Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico. His parents were Alejandro Berenguer, a mason, and Eugenia Padilla, a housewife. At age 6, he emigrated to the Dominican Republic with his parents, where he spent his childhood and part of his youth. He also learned to trade as a cobbler there. In 1929, he returned to Puerto Rico and established a shoe repair shop in Ponce.Luis Angel Ferrao.

He set up his shoe repair shop at Marina and Aurora streets, at a building used by the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party to celebrate its meetings in that city. The Insular Police carried out the 1937 Ponce massacre, under the instructions of US-installed governor Blanton Winship, outside this building.Visita a Ponce.

Luis Irizarry of the Puerto Rican National Guard, in their attempt on the life of U.S.-installed governor Blanton Winship in retaliation for the Blanton-ordered Ponce massacre. The other Nationalists also accused of murder by the government of Blanton Winship in relation to the massacre were Luis Castro Quesada, Julio Pinto Gand√≠a, Lorenzo Pi√±eiro, (Interim President and Interim Secretary General of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party), Plinio Graciani, Tom√°s L√≥pez de Victoria, Mart√≠n Gonz√°lez Ruiz, Elifaz Escobar, Luis √Ångel Correa, Santiago Gonz√°lez, and Orlando Col√≥n Leyro.

She worked in close collaboration with her husband, Robin Tanner, at their home in Kington Langley, Wiltshire. Biography Tanner was born as Heather Spackman at 'Rose Cottage', Priory Street, Corsham, Wiltshire on 14 July 1903. Her parents were Daisy Goold (1865‚Äì1945) and Herbert Spackman (1864‚Äì1949), who had three daughters: Sylvia, Heather and Faith (Olive). Herbert Spackman, an accomplished musician and photographer, ran a grocery and drapery store in Corsham High Street. Heather and her younger sister, Faith Sharp, edited an account of their father‚Äôs early life, A Corsham Boyhood: The Diary of Herbert Spackman 1877‚Äì1891. Heather Tanner attended Chippenham Grammar School, where she met her future husband, the etcher and teacher Robin Tanner. In his autobiography, Double Harness, Robin recounts how, as school prefects he and Heather would smuggle secret messages to each other in the absentee registers for which they were responsible as their relationship blossomed in the early 1920s.Robin Tanner, Double Harness: An Autobiography(London: Impact, 1987), 21. Heather achieved a First Class degree at King's College London, which she left in 1929 to become an English teacher at The Duchess School for Girls, Alnwick Castle, Northumberland.See account in An Exceptional Woman: The Writings of Heather Tanner, ed. by Rosemary Devonald (Salisbury: Hobnob Press, 2006). After a brief geographical separation while Robin studied at Goldsmiths College, London, they married at Corsham Church on 4 April 1931. Heather and Robin Tanner moved to Kington Langley, Wiltshire, after their wedding, the start of a lifelong creative collaboration and residence. In Double Harness, Robin Tanner writes that Heather‚Äôs uncle, the architect Vivian Goold, 'generously offered as a wedding gift to design a house for us and supervise its building if we could find a piece of land we liked'.Robin Tanner, Double Harness, 45. The result was Old Chapel Field, completed in 1931. The house, which is still standing in the village, is a distinctive blend of arts and crafts and modernist styles. Inspired by C.F.A. Voysey, Goold came to regard the house as the finest that he had designed. Heather and Robin had great affection for the 'Voyseyish' Old Chapel Field, where they were to live for the rest of their lives. The Tanners were thrilled to discover that Francis Kilvert‚Äôs great-grandfather was buried in the graveyard of the Chapel from which their home took its name, and both Heather and Robin actively supported the Kilvert Society. In the spring of 1939 the Tanners took in a young Jewish refugee from Germany called Dietrich Hanff (1920‚Äì1992). Shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War, Hanff was interned and held as an enemy alien at Bury, Lancashire. Heather campaigned against what she considered his unfair treatment in the press, and eventually she was allowed to visit him after his transfer to the Isle of Man. It was later learned that his parents and brother were deported from their native Stettin (then Germany) to Piaski, Poland and that the Germans murdered them there in gas chambers.Heather Tanner and Dietrich Hanff, Out of Nazi Germany: An Account of the Life of Dietrich Hanff (London: Impact, 1995), iv. After Hanff finally gained his freedom as the Tanners‚Äô adopted son, 'Dieti' was to closely share their interests, to become a teacher and university lecturer and to live at Old Chapel Field for the rest of his life. After the War, Heather worked as an examiner in English for the University of Cambridge and later at the University of London.Robin Tanner, Double Harness, 123. Her moral and spiritual outlook as a Quaker was to deeply affect her outlook and support for a range of environmental and social causes. She was an active member of the Chippenham branch of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (visiting the Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp and attending many Aldermaston Marches) and supporter of Friends of the Earth and Oxfam. During the 1980s, BBC television producer Margaret Benton made a film called Look Stranger: A Vision of Wiltshire which was released in 1987. This documented and celebrated Heather, Robin and Dieti‚Äôs home life, creativity, beliefs and love of the Wiltshire countryside. Outliving both her husband and Dietrich Hanff, Heather Tanner died at Kington St Michael on 23 June 1993. Works The Tanners created four books, that Robin illustrated and for which Heather provided the text, collaborating so closely together that Robin wrote that 'they were essentially the production of two minds working in such close unison that it would be impossible to separate them.'Robin Tanner, Double Harness, 208. = Wiltshire Village = Wiltshire Village is a thinly disguised description of the village life and countryside surrounding the Tanners' home. The subject of the book Kington Borel takes its name from a compound of their own village, Kington Langley, and the neighbouring parish of Langley Burrell (named after the Borel family who held the estate and manor in Norman times). First published in 1939, the book has been the most widely admired and frequently reprinted fruit of the couple‚Äôs creative collaboration. Heather Tanner‚Äôs text and Robin Tanner‚Äôs etchings and pen drawings distil all that is picturesque in the rural landscape of North-West Wiltshire. Featuring history, culture, crafts and wildlife, Wiltshire Village embraces much of the Tanners' aesthetic and ethical creed as the celebration of traditional rural crafts and community is underpinned by a rejection of militarism, blood sports and the conservative outlook of feudal England; a creed in keeping with that of their hero William Morris. = Woodland Plants = In many ways a companion volume for Wiltshire Village, the Tanners similarly started to collate the materials for Woodland Plants during the early years of the Second World War, although the completed project was not published until 1981. It has been suggested that the manuscript was lost under the Tanners' bed for 17 years.Joe James, 'Heather & Robin', Corsham Spotlight 4.3 (November 2006), 5; http://www.corsham-civic- society.co.uk/Nov2006.pdf [accessed 9 November 2010]. The Tanners were keen amateur botanists and counted their original copy of James Sowerby‚Äôs 37-volume English Botany (1790‚Äì1814) as one of their most treasured possessions. Woodland Plants is an account of local plants' uses, lore and presence in literature. Robin Tanner was keen to produce the detailed drawings from sketches made in situ, mostly within a few miles of their home such as in the Weavern Valley and at Bird's Marsh and Thickwood. In an epilogue, Heather reflects upon the way that the forty years gestation of the book enabled them to observe and reflect upon the environmental damage that took place during the intervening period, but also, more positively, the emergence of ecological awareness. = A Country Alphabet = The preface to A Country Alphabet indicates that this work was a collaborative project shared between Heather who wrote the text and Robin who designed the letters. 'As a drawing was finished Heather would contemplate it as she went about the daily chores, now and then scribbling an idea on the nearest piece of paper.'Heather and Robin Tanner, A Country Alphabet (London: Impact Press, 1987), 6. Their friends the publishers Frances and Nicolas MacDowall at Old Stile Press contributed creatively towards the feel of the book through their experimentation and selection of typefaces, paper and pagination when it was first published as a limited hand-printed edition in 1984. This resulted in an extremely tactile volume both in its content with its sensory celebration of physical things and in A Country Alphabet‚Äôs feel and physical appearance as an artefact in its own right. = A Country Book of Days = Reawakens the pre-Victorian genre of the book of days with a celebration of rural life and rites through the cycle of the year. Heather Tanner‚Äôs twenty-five entries, set out as a commonplace book, are accompanied by Robin Tanner‚Äôs woodcuts. Like A Country Alphabet, to which it is in some ways a companion volume, A Country Books of Days was originally published as a hand-printed limited edition in 1986, thus owing much not only to the style of William Morris but also to the early craft of book production exemplified by William Blake. Two further books were published posthumously. = Out of Nazi Germany: An Account of the Life of Dietrich Hanff = Hanff‚Äôs 1944 account of his escape from Nazi Germany, together with an essay by Heather Tanner based on papers that she was working on at the end of her life in 1993. Published by Impact, 1995. = An Exceptional Woman: The Writings of Heather Tanner = An Exceptional Woman: The Writings of Heather Tanner was edited by her friend Rosemary Devonald and published by Hobnob Press in 2006. It includes memories of Heather‚Äôs early life in Corsham, a fine essay on the Wiltshire Countryside, and What I Believe outlining her Quaker philosophy. Bibliography * Tanner, Heather.

Brace is most widely known for her charcoal on Mylar (polyester film) drawings of cloud-inhabited landscapes, which she first exhibited in a solo exhibition in 1997. Education and Representation Hilary Brace received her MFA degree from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1985 and her BFA (1983) and BA degrees (in Painting and Art History) from Western Washington State University in Bellingham, WA. Over the past 25 years Brace has exhibited her work regularly in public institutions and commercial galleries. She is the recipient of numerous national and regional awards, including a Guggenheim Fellowship (2006), National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship (1993), California Arts Council Fellowship (2003), and two grants from the Pollock-Krasner Foundation (1997 and 2005). Her work is represented in Los Angeles by Craig Krull Gallery and in New York by Edward Thorp Gallery. Brace's charcoal on Mylar drawings are included in numerous private and public collections including the Boise Art Museum, Nora Eccles Harrison Museum of Art, the Santa Barbara Museum of Art and Western Washington State University Art Museum. Other institutions that have exhibited Brace's drawings include the Weatherspoon Art Museum at the University of North Carolina, Greensboro, NC, Frye Art Museum, Seattle, WA, South Texas Institute of Art, Corpus Christi, TX, Columbus Museum, Columbus GA, Telfair Museum of Art, Savannah, GA, Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery, Riverside Art Museum, Riverside, CA, and the Schneider Museum of Art, Southern Oregon University, Ashland, OR. Charcoal Drawings In reviewing Hilary Brace‚Äôs charcoal on Mylar drawings for the New York Times, Ken Johnson wrote, ‚Äúonce in a while you come across an art of such refined technique that it seems the product of sorcery more than human craft‚Äù. Despite the photographic veracity of her technique, Brace composes her images without premeditation, through an explorative process that allows them to unfold in unanticipated directions. Her current smaller, nearly postcard-sized charcoal drawings, along with her earlier charcoals, are made in a reductive manner by first darkening the entire surface with charcoal and then removing the medium with various hand-made tools, allowing the image to emerge through chance and intuition. For works of somewhat larger scale, greater complexity and more refined technique, Brace creates studies in a similarly explorative manner while she refers to photographs of sculptural tableaus and other diverse means of garnering information.

Early training Paw Oo Thet was born in 1936 in Mandalay, son of an artist who taught art in a public school. He lost his mother when he was young, and was brought up by his father, who taught him to draw and paint. At the age of twelve, shortly after the end of World War II, he lost his right hand while playing with a hand grenade and was forced to learn to write and draw with his left hand. As a school student, he won many prizes in art competitions and participated in some exhibitions, but he did not acquire an education beyond high school. He and Win Pe, both born in the same year, studied under Ba Thet, who sent the two young artists to Kin Maung (Bank) (c. 1908‚àí83) to learn about modernistic, more abstract art trends. Both Paw Oo Thet and Win Pe embraced such trends. Early professional career By the age of twenty-one, Paw Oo Thet was earning enough to make a living from his art as an illustrator and cartoonist in local magazines and newspapers, including the People's Daily in Mandalay, The Mirror, and the Working People‚Äôs Daily in Yangon. He won a scholarship in 1959 that let him and Win Pe undertake Norman Rockwell's correspondence course, the Famous Artists School, in the United States. The exposure to the work of Dong Kingman, the Chinese-American watercolorist, often described as an impressionist and who was one of the instructors of the Famous Artists School, influenced both Paw Oo Thet and Win Pe in a large way. In the case of Paw Oo Thet, Kingman's influence carried over in Paw Oo Thet's vibrant use of color, which was a refreshing change in Burmese arts for much Burmese painting until then was characterized by somber and subdued coloring, and in oil painting, heavy and dark use of chiaroscuro, acquired from the style of Ba Nyan. His oeuvre Paw Oo Thet's oeuvre possesses four or five genres, or styles. First, there were his light-hearted strip cartoons which he published in magazines; in fact, he became the founder of a popular comic strip, Gali, published in Mandalay. Comic-strip painting was not new to Burma, and Ba Gyan (1902‚Äì1953), had earlier won the highest award in Burma for artistic accomplishment, the Alinga Kyaw Zwa, for his cartoon work, poking fun at the pompous and vulnerable side of human nature and sometimes political in nature. This history and taste for cartoon gave artists in Burma the inspiration to explore cartoon art as a serious form of expression. Paw Oo Thet's second genre was his free-standing watercolor paintings, sold to private collectors, to be framed and hung in homes or offies. These paintings borrowed much from Dong Kingman with their bold vibrant colors, but not often of Kingman's fluid composition. Many of these paintings were done in a geometric format, semi- cubist in style, and it seems that Paw Oo Thet's largest inspiration here came from his training in modernistic painting and design from Kin Maung (Bank). The paintings were often of market or village scenes or squeezed arrangements of temples, the last typical of some of Kin Maung's oil work. Paw Oo Thet's taste for cartoon passed over into this work also, as one of the singular marks in these watercolor paintings are the wide, exaggerated comic grins on the faces of figures. These cheerful paintings had many fans among Burmese, and they sold at a price which could be afforded by middle-class Burmese. These may be called Paw Oo Thet's commercial work, his bread and butter. It is said of these paintings that his nephew, the tapestry artist Sein Myint, would copy Paw Oo Thet's paintings, and sometimes Sein Myint completed the copy before the original was done. Paw Oo Thet himself differentiated between his commercial work, often executed tortuously and tediously, and his serious painting, inspired by deeper creative impulses, which flowed freely and unconsciously. He regarded himself as an expressionist painter. And it is in this third genre that his most serious work was done, usually in oil. But it is very difficult to describe this work with an ism, for once the inspiration began, the outcome of the painting was fairly unpredictable. In this genre, he did family and group portraits, self-portraits, landscapes, work inspired by Burmese traditions or Bagan mural painting, one entirely non-figurative abstract painting, as well as other work. Some of his outstanding paintings in this genre are Three Blind Men (date unknown and documented only in a black and white photo), Self-Portrait in Robes (1967), Soldier Playing Guitar (1976), Royal Game Hunt (1974), Buddha and the Five Disciples (1971), Family (1979) (with much influence of Henry Moore and done in several versions), Portrait of his Father U Hla Gyi (1967), Marionette Duo (1974) and Expecting Mother (1974) (of his wife). All of these works can be found in Ma Thanegi's Paw Oo Thett (1936‚Äì1993), His Life and His Creativity and some of them in Andrew Ranard's Burmese Painting: A Linear and Lateral History. A last genre of Paw Oo Thet are the works he did on commission to illustrate stories in magazines, book covers, and texts of books such as The Orange-Robed Boy, written in English by Patricia Wallace Garlan and Marjarene Dunstan (1967). In this book, 21 of his watercolor illustrations lavished the text. His commissioned work for books such as this or for the writings of other authors, oddly, seem to be some of his most imaginatively inspired watercolor. In The Orange-Robed Boy, Kingman's influence of a free and open composition sometimes appeared, but if the text was in Burmese and the theme he was illustrating was of a strong traditional bent, he might reach back to the techniques of Traditional painting to do the works. Milestones Paw Oo Thet's acquired a large reputation in Burma when his first one-man show, sponsored by the Burma- America Institute, an arm of the USIS, opened in Rangoon on November 22, 1963, the day of John F. Kennedy's assassination, and all the paintings sold out. It is often said that this show kicked off the 1960s modernistic movement in Burma. However, Aung Khin (1921‚Äì1996), the Mandalay painter, had exhibited modernistic paintings more than a decade earlier, but Aung Khin's work did not catch fire or initiate a movement. Later, Paw Oo Thet painted watercolors to raise money for a UNICEF funding campaign, The images for the paintings,Asian Harbor Scene (1974) and Market (1975), were used for diaries, stamps and greeting cards. His illustrations were also used for a literacy campaign, supported by the United Nations and the Burmese Government, and for several educational books. Overview It is said that Paw Oo Thet became well known amongst connoisseurs for his blend of Myanmar traditions with modern Western techniques and that he successfully revived the traditional Burmese style in a modern manner. This characterization of Paw Oo Thet makes his work sound much like Ba Kyi's. However, while Ba Kyi (1912‚Äì2000) and Paw Oo Thet both dealt with traditional themes of Burmese culture, their paths were quite different. Ba Kyi had little interest in abstract, modernistic forms. Ba Kyi was interested in initiating a Neo-Traditional revival of Burmese painting, through introducing basic techniques of Western painting to Traditional painting to enliven the genre. Paw Oo Thet, on the other hand, like his early teacher Kin Maung (Bank), had a strong interest in modernistic forms of painting and had a close eye on these trends in the outside world. He wanted to introduce expressionism, cubism and other more abstract forms of painting to Burma and to use these forms to express the national culture. There are, however, cases of overlap where Paw Oo Thet's painting might resemble Ba Kyi's or even that of Aung Soe (1924‚Äì90) who pushed modernistic painting forward in Burma in a far more pioneering and aggressive fashion. The overlap in these three painter's works occurs when they are doing paintings meant to capture the more ancient moods of Burmese culture and are heavily borrowing techniques from Traditional painting. One commentator has said that Paw Oo Thet's figurative illustrations of local legends and genre scenes were close to the hearts of the masses. According to Sonny Nyein, a publisher and part-time sculptor who is close to the art community in Burma, \\"His [Paw Oo Thet's] paintings reflect the mood of the people\\". Ma Thanegi wrote of Paw Oo Thet, referring to his more commercial work, \\"He was most known for his colourful and elegantly done water-colours of Myanmar scenes which viewers and collectors from all over the world treasured, but he never felt satisfied that it was truly art born out of his feelings. He may never have realized that in spite of being just 'pretty pictures' as he called them, they gave a true sene of the lives of the people.\\" Death Paw Oo Thet was a heavy smoker and died at the age of 57 from lung cancer. His funeral was attended by a great many artists of his period, who compiled a short work of collected poems for the occasion. He was a well-loved artist with a disarming sense of humor and the stumbling, sometimes penetrating, vision of a self-educated individual. Later, his letters to his wife, written to her in Mandalay while he was living in Rangoon and struggling to make a living there, were collected and published along with essays he had published in magazines, interviews others had conducted with him, and eulogies about him written by other painters.

The sheriff had judicial, electoral, ceremonial and administrative functions and executed High Court Writs. In 1908, an Order in Council made the Lord-Lieutenant the Sovereign's prime representative in a county and reduced the High Sheriff's precedence. However the sheriff retained his responsibilities for the preservation of law and order in the county. The usual procedure for appointing the sheriff from 1660 onwards was that three persons were nominated at the beginning of each year from the county and the Lord Lieutenant then appointed his choice as High Sheriff for the remainder of the year. Often the other nominees were appointed as under-sheriffs.

The building was the tallest in the state when built, and later joined with the larger addition directly to the south in 1921. The upper part of the facade is cast iron, reputedly the last such facade in Detroit. Frank & Seder Russian Jewish immigrants Isaac Seder and Jacob H. Frank started a wholesale women's wear business in the early 1900s, then switched to retail, opening a downtown Pittsburgh store in 1907. The business grew, expanding into a department store, and adding locations in New York City, Philadelphia and Detroit. The Pittsburgh Frank & Seder was expanded in 1913, but destroyed by fire in 1917 at a loss of $600,000; its replacement was completed in 1918. The first Frank & Seder Philadelphia store opened in 1915, reopened in 1925 with , and was joined by a branch store for women's wear in 1929. F&S; built an eight-story Detroit store on Woodward Avenue with 180-foot frontage and financial capital of $3,000,000; \\"one unit\\" of the store opened in April 1921 while construction was apparently ongoing. An initial design called for a 12-story building, 120 by 150 feet, reinforced concrete, brick, and steel. National Department Stores acquired the Frank & Seder group of stores in 1923, including Frank & Seder, Inc. (Pittsburgh); Lewin-Nieman Co. (Pittsburgh); Fink Co. (Philadelphia); Frank A Seder Co. of Philadelphia and Frank & Seder Co. of Detroit. In 1921, Frank & Seder leased store space (five floors and basement) of the Marbridge Building at 34th Street and 6th Avenue, New York City, made available in September of that year. The Detroit store became the subject of a sit-down strike in 1937 when 11 men entered in the evening, then called for the store's 550 employees to protest labor conditions, related to the widespread strikes taking place at Detroit automakers and suppliers during the previous week. After 300 police, the state governor, and city mayor arrived on scene and the 43 remaining sitters were evicted, warrants were issued for their arrest, some of whom were revealed to have criminal records. The Philadelphia branch store was closed in 1949 after losing its lease to a competing store. In 1950, the Philadelphia main store offered free Saturday afternoon shorts, cartoons, and full-length movies for children, as a babysitting service for shoppers, and later the same year, sponsored the WCAU-TV broadcast of TV Spelling B. The chain closed its Detroit store in 1951, and its remaining Philadelphia store in 1953. Several labor organizations staged strikes, accompanied by violence, against Frank & Seder and four other major Pittsburgh retailers from 1953 to 1954. These actions were ruled by the NLRB to be violations of the 1935 National Labor Relations Act. The protests, and the development of suburban shopping centers, imposed financial difficulties on F&S.; The Pittsburgh Frank & Seder store closed in 1958, and still stands at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Smithfield St. The Philadelphia store was demolished for a parking garage in 1959.

It was designed by the architect Samuel Daukes. Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin and John Hardman undertook the design and execution of the chancel roof. St Saviour's is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History The church was built in 1848 as a chapel of ease in the parish of St Mary the Virgin's Church, Tetbury. At that time the richer people paid a fee for the use of a pew in St Mary's (a pew rent). St Saviour's was built for the poorer people who could not afford this charge, and it came to be described as \\"a little church for the poor\\". Architecture =Exterior= St Saviour's is a Gothic Revival church in the Decorated Gothic style, built in local stone with Cotswold stone roofs. The plan has a nave with side aisles and a chancel from which projects a north vestry. The main entrance is through a south porch into the nave. The church has steeply gabled ends, which project beyond the roofline, terminating in small crosses and, at the western end, a bellcote. There is no clerestory, the roof of the nave extending into catslides of a less steep pitch over the aisles. The corners of the building have splayed stepped buttresses, with two more buttresses occurring on the west front, at the ends of the aisles. The main windows of the church have tracery in the Flowing Decorated Gothic style of the early 14th century, that at the east of the chancel being the largest with three lights. There are two light windows in the south wall of the chancel, the ends of the aisles and a larger two light window into the nave. High in the nave gables are two small rose windows. The sides of the aisles are lit by small lancets. =Interior= Inside the church the nave is separated from the aisles by arcades of four bays supported on alternate round and octagonal piers. All the fittings date from the time of the building of the church. These include the pews with poppyhead ends, the stone font, the stone pulpit, and the wooden chancel screen. The original gas fittings are still in the church, although they are no longer functioning. These include the pipes, the wall brackets, and on the top of the chancel screen, a burner bar consisting of a row of gas jets. The organ formerly in the church has been removed. External features The lychgate is designated as a Grade II listed building. It is thought to be contemporary with the church, and is built in stone with a Cotswold slate roof. The churchyard contains the war graves of six Commonwealth service personnel of World War I, and ten of World War II.

Houfton Sir John Plowright Houfton (13 December 1857 ‚Äì 18 November 1929) was a British colliery owner and politician from Mansfield in Nottinghamshire. He sat in the House of Commons from 1922 to 1923. Houfton first stood for election to Parliament at a by-election in May 1914, when he was the Liberal Party candidate for North East Derbyshire. The vacancy had been caused by the death of the sitting Member of Parliament (MP) William Harvey, who had been a Liberal-Labour candidate when first elected in 1907, and had held the seat with comfortable majorities at both elections in 1910. The local Liberal Association had sought to run another Liberal-Labour candidate, and were keen that James Martin, a prominent Liberal and President of the Derbyshire Miners Association, would be their candidate. However, Martin, who was keen to stand, was required by the MFGB to pledge support to the Labour Party. The Liberals therefore had to find a different candidate, and the by-election became a three-way contest, with Liberal, Labour and Conservative Party candidates. Houfton lost by a margin to 314 votes (1.9%) to the Conservative candidate George Bowden, with Labour's James Martin polling 22.5% of the votes. Houfton did not stand again until 1922, when the death of Sir J. D. Rees triggered a by-election in the Nottingham East constituency. He was selected as the Coalition Unionist candidate (i.e. a Conservative standing in the support of the coalition government led by the Liberal David Lloyd George). After a campaign described by The Times newspaper as \\"strenuous\\", Houfton won the seat with 52% of the votes, and a majority of 4,973 (25%) over the second-placed Labour Co-operative candidate. He was re-elected at the general election in December 1922, but was defeated at the 1923 general election by the Liberal candidate Norman Birkett. In August 1926, after the general strike 1926, Houfton was strongly criticised by the Labour MP Frank Varley for negotiating a separate deal with Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire coal miners, without the support of the Miners Federation of Great Britain. He was knighted in the King's Birthday Honours in 1929, \\"for political and public services\\".

He became secretary of the departmental union of Loire Atlantique, from its inception, as well as Raymond Patoux, secretary of the departmental union of Maine et Loire, as shown by the research Libertaires et syndicalistes r√©volutionnaires dans la Conf√©d√©ration G√©n√©rale du Travail - Force Ouvri√®re (1946-1957) by Guillaume Trousset,Pelloutier.net  Libertaires et syndicalistes r√©volutionnaires dans la CGT-Force Ouvri√®re (1946-1957) andL'Union D√©partementale CGT-Force ouvri√®re de Maine et Loire de 1948 √† 195 by Manuella Noyer.Pelloutier.net  L‚ÄôUnion d√©partementale CGT-Force ouvri√®re de Maine et Loire de 1948 √† 1956 He played an important role in the accession to these unions of militants of the autonomous F√©d√©ration de l'Education Nationale in 1982, 1983 and 1984. Its activities of militant trade unionism had been permanently in the style set out by Fernand Pelloutier in the letter to his anarchist friends Lettre aux anarchistes in 1899. He didn't cease to fight against all the followers (official and unofficial) of trade unionism who were subservient to political parties, Christian trade unionism, autonomous trade unionism, partisan trade unionism, and all varieties of company sponsored or integrated trade unionism; he could never get along with the followers of all these sorts of trade unionism! A fighter for workers' emancipation in all circumstances, he did not hesitate to separate himself from some of his anarchist fellows who took another way, including that of joining the varieties of Christian trade unionism. As a militant anarchist, he was of those who reconstructed the anarchist movement after the second world war, through the F√©d√©ration anarchiste; in 1954, he was one of those who reconstructed the F√©d√©ration anarchist destroyed by the Leninist action of Georges Fontenis; in 1961, he contributed with his followers of the Groupe Fernand Pelloutier to the publication of the news bulletin L'Anarcho- syndicaliste,http://anti.mythes.voila.net/publications/as/as.html prelude to the constitution of the Union des anarcho- syndicalistes.http://anti.mythes.voila.net/organisations/uas/uas.html Not having any sectarianism, he tried at all times to gather together the activist workers anxious to preserve the independence of trade unions; a friend of Pierre Boussel alias Pierre Lambert, he certainly helped the abandonment by the members of his Trotskyist party of the Marxist‚ÄìLeninist-Trotskyist idea of the need to link the unions to the ‚Äúrevolutionary party‚Äù.

Life Born in Ottawa, Ontario, Checkland worked at the Bank of Nova Scotia, then the Ottawa Sanitary Laundry Company, while he gained associate membership of the Canadian Bankers' Association. In 1938, he moved to England to study at the University of Birmingham, and in his final year served as President of the Guild of Students at the university. In 1941, he was elected as President of the National Union of Students, serving for only one year before becoming President of the International Council of Students.\\"Checkland, Sydney George\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography In late 1942, Checkland enrolled at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, then was commissioned as a lieutenant into the Manchester Regiment, before becoming a tank commander in the Governor General's Foot Guards of the Canadian Army. An injury during the Normandy Landings at Falaisehttps://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf left him with permanent nerve damage. After the war, Checkland joined the Common Wealth Party and stood unsuccessfully in Sheffield Ecclesall at the 1945 general election. He then returned to study for a master's degree at Birmingham, after which he took up an academic post in economic science at the University of Liverpool, where he also obtained a doctorate. In 1953, he transferred to the University of Cambridge, then in 1957 he accepted a personal chair at the University of Glasgow and founded the Department of Economic History. He quickly developed a strong reputation in a range of fields relating to economic history, and continued to write until his death in 1986. He is credited with \\"being instrumental\\" in the establishment in 1976 of the Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Glasgow \\"strong in the fields of business, banking, and urban history\\". Sydney Checkland was elected as a Fellow of the British Academy in 1977, and as Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1981. He was a member of the Economic History Committee of the Social Science Research Council and then a Council member between 1970 and 1972. He was President of the Economic History Society between 1977 and 1980. Of his many scholarly publications, The Gladstones: a Family Biography, 1764-1851 (1971) won a Scottish Arts Council book award and Scottish Banking: a History, 1695-1973 (1975) won a Saltire Society prize. Checkland also served as a board member with the East Kilbride Development Corporation, 1964 to 1968. During his career as a historian Checkland contributed to the development of archival records. In Liverpool he collected the archives of merchant firms and initiated the University of Glasgow's collection of business records. He chaired of the Scottish Records Advisory Council, the National Register of Archives (Scotland) and was vice-president of the Business Archives Council of Scotland. Checkland's own papers are held by Glasgow University Archive Services. Family Checkland met Edith Olive Anthony in Birmingham and they married in 1942.

Both ships were constructed for the Imperial Russian Navy in the late 1890s. During the Russo- Japanese War of 1904‚Äì05 they were assigned to the Pacific Fleet. Yenisei struck one of her own mines two days after the war began while laying a minefield and sank. One of Amurs minefields sank the Japanese pre-dreadnought battleships and . Amur was sunk by Japanese howitzers in December 1904 after the Japanese had gained control of the heights around Port Arthur. She was later salvaged and scrapped by the Japanese. Design and description The Amur-class minelayers were designed to drop their mines while at high speed and were given a pronounced, overhanging, stern that allowed the mines to be dropped behind the propellers through doors in the stern. Each door was served by a rail that led directly to the mine storage compartments. The Amur-class ships were long at the waterline; they had a beam of and a draft of .Gardiner, p. 204 They had two pole masts and a ram bow. The ships had two vertical triple expansion steam engines, each powering one propeller. Twelve Belleville water-tube boilers provided steam.

They carried of coal that provided a range of at a speed of .Watts, p. 172 The main armament of the Amur-class ships consisted of five Canet Pattern 1892 50-caliber guns. The gun fired shells to a range of about at its maximum elevation of 21¬∞ with a muzzle velocity of . The rate of fire was between twelve and fifteen rounds per minute. The ships also mounted seven Hotchkiss guns. They fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of 20 rounds per minute to a range of . The Amur- class ships mounted one torpedo tube and carried 300 mines. Service Both ships, Amur and Yenisei, were built by the Baltic Works in Saint Petersburg. They were laid down in 1898 and completed the following year. They were assigned to the Pacific Fleet when the Russo-Japanese War began in 1904 and based in Port Arthur. Two days after the Japanese surprise attack on Port Arthur on 8/9 February 1904, Yenisei was laying a minefield at Dalian Bay when one mine broke loose and began floating towards the ship. While maneuvering to avoid the mine Yenisei accidentally entered the minefield that she'd just laid and hit a mine. The consequent explosion caused eight mines still on the rails to detonate, killing 96 or 100 crewmen and sinking the ship in 20 minutes. The protected cruiser and four destroyers responded to the incident, but Boyarin hit one of Yeniseis mines. The explosion flooded the ship's machinery spaces and her crew abandoned ship. The cruiser remained afloat, but foundered in Dalian Bay the next day during a storm.Russian Minelayers Amur and Yenisei, pp. 205-06 On the morning of 15 May 1904, Rear Admiral Nashiba Tokioki led a squadron consisting of the pre-dreadnoughts Hatsuse, Yashima and to bombard Port Arthur. They encountered a field of 50 mines laid by Amur the evening before. Hatsuse hit one mine that disabled her engines and steering and drifted into another mine that caused one of her forward magazines to detonate. The ship sank in about 90 seconds, taking 496 men down with her. Yashima struck another mine as she maneuvered around the drifting Hatsuse, but she was towed away from the minefield. By the late afternoon Yashimas flooding had become unstoppable and she was abandoned by her crew. Three hours later the ship capsized and sank.Forczyk, p. 46 Amur was subsequently besieged in Port Arthur and hit in drydock a number of times by howitzer shells on 8 December 1904. She was knocked over on her port side and rested on the side of the dock at an angle of 68¬∞. On 18 December she was hit again by 30 shells and sunk on her side.

The Virtual Teaching Collection (VTC) project at the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology within the University of Cambridge, led by Dr Robin Boast, ran from 1994 to 1997 and was part of the Teaching and Learning Technology Project funded by the Higher Education Funding Council for England. The VTC was an early innovative social computing project that developed a software program, Cabinet, which ran on Apple Macs and allowed users to create, develop, manage and comment on virtual museum collections. The project anticipated many of the current features of the social web and social computing. The VTC was concerned with virtual objects. It was a collection of digital representations that may be used as a collection. The images did not pretend to be the objects, but were objects in their own right and, therefore, able to constitute a collection in their own right. The goals of the VTC were twofold. First, to explore the range and potential of producing and using digital representations in their various forms; images, texts, hypertexts, video, sound, 3-D images and illustrations. Second, to construct a working digital museum that was meaningful to the way we work with collections. The collections that were developed included about 4,000 images and other representations of objects, along with the related catalogue information. Within the Archaeology Collection, these objects span the Neolithic to the Medieval period in Britain. The History of Science Collection drew on the collections of the Whipple Museum at the University of Cambridge and the History of Science Collection at the University of Oxford. As well as directly related information, these Collections also included text, video, and display resources, as well as bibliographies and glossaries. Included in the collections were a variety of what were called \\"narratives\\". These were works using the collections in a variety of forms from traditional documents to hyper-documents to display spaces, but these are seen, much as any work, as the view of an author. This was central to the way that Cabinet collections work. They are not fixed ‚Äòtextbooks‚Äô but flexible resources that teachers and students may work with to create meaningful works. It was in this way that the collections do not form an end in themselves, but a means of working. They are the very flexible resource that students and researchers use to think with. Cabinet Cabinet was a software application developed as part of the VTC and was designed to be an easy to use and well presented suite of software tools that were intuitive. Using these tools, the user could create their own collection, and could search, retrieve, display and browse the existing collections. The presentation tools allowed the user to compare different objects, to identify and display significant details, to create links to related images, video and text, and to embed representations in their own authored texts or other presentations, whether these be straightforward documents or more complex hyper-documents. Cabinet was not simply a multimedia authoring tool. It was designed to be under the control not only of the author, but also of the reader. The collections were not interactive in the conventional sense, but were interactive in the sense that the reader could also modify or even re-author what had been produced. This kind of flexibility of presentation tools freed the user from the rigidity of traditional presentations and gave access to the full potential of contextualising information. There was an increased variety of narrative forms, but, primarily, it was an environment within which students and researchers could construct and explore new ways of thinking about material objects and their history.

The building, which served as a beer hall and restaurant, was modeled after an early 17th-century building in Heidelberg Castle, the \\"Friedrichsbau\\", and was named after Joseph Viktor von Scheffel, a German poet and novelist. It later became known as Allaire's, a name still inscribed on the building. The building's style has been described as \\"German- American eclectic Renaissance Revival\\". p.205 Later, in the late 1920s, the building was used by the German-American Athletic Club. By 1939 it became the German-American Rathskeller, and then Joe King's Rathskeller. O. Henry used Scheffel Hall as the setting for \\"The Halberdier of the Little Rheinschloss\\" and wrote some of his stories there. Beginning in the 1970s, it was the home of Fat Tuesday's, a well-known jazz club, and the restaurant Tuesday's, which lasted until the early 21st century. It is currently a yoga and pilates studio.

Within biology he is known for his contributions to the study of Hawaiian land snails, part of malacology. Life David Dwight Baldwin was born November 26, 1831 in Honolulu. His father was early missionary doctor Dwight Baldwin (1798‚Äì1886), and his mother was Charlotte Fowler Baldwin (1805‚Äì1873). After a few years living in Waimea, the family moved to the island of Maui around 1837. From 1841 through 1851, Baldwin attended Punahou School in Honolulu, and graduated from Yale in 1857. He married Lois Gregory Morris (1837‚Äì1924) on October 7 of that year at Bridgeport, Connecticut. The couple returned to the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1858, and had nine children, although one died young. From 1860 to 1862 Baldwin served in the Kingdom House of Representatives. Around 1865 he became manager of the sugarcane plantation in Kohala on the northern coast of Hawaiii Island. This plantation had been founded by the missionary Elias Bond. In 1872 Baldwin and his family lived in New Haven, Connecticut while he worked in the Yale Law School library and earned his Master of Arts degree. On his return to Hawaii he started an almost 40-year association with the education department of the Hawaiian government. He was vice-principal of Lahainaluna School from 1874 to 1877.Anonymous (1912) \\"David Dwight Baldwin\\". The Nautilus 26(7): 82‚Äì83. While he was inspector-general of the schools from 1877 to 1885, instruction was changed from the Hawaiian language to English. Baldwin returned to Lahainaluna and served as vice-principal again until 1890. In 1890 he moved to Ha ªik≈´ where his younger brother Henry Perrine Baldwin (1842‚Äì1911) had founded the agricultural venture Alexander & Baldwin with his brother-in- law Samuel Thomas Alexander (1836‚Äì1904). He organized a small school for the plantation employees. Baldwin had earlier published a list of Hawaiian mosses and liverworts (hepatic plants, or Hepaticae in Latin). =Malacology= In the 1890s he devoted much of his time to studying mollusks (malacology), specifically the study of Hawaiian land snails, some of which he named and described. In addition, several land snail species in the family Achatinellidae were named in honor of him, as well as a subgenus Baldwinia of the genus Partulina. He produced the first catalog of Hawaiian land snails and freshwater snails in 1893. His schoolmate from Punahou, J. T. Gulick, had published early theories of evolution which were based on their mollusc shell collections. In the Hawaiian language, the word for any kind of snail is p≈´p≈´. The same word also referred to small bits of fish, chicken, or banana relish served with kava. Because of the mixture of various cultures and cuisines in the islands, the word pupu became associated with any relish, appetizer, canap√©, or hors d'oeuvre, and the modern pu pu platter. =Retirement and last years= Upon David Baldwin's retirement from teaching in 1903, the Baldwin brothers (David and Henry) invested in the first commercial cultivation of pineapple on Maui. Three years later, Belle Dickey, who was the niece of both a brother-in-law and a sister-in-law of Baldwin, married James Dole, who popularized Hawaiian pineapple. After a cancer operation in February 1911, Baldwin died on June 16, 1912 at the Queen's Medical Center in Honolulu. His remains were shipped to Maui and buried at the Makawao Union Church cemetery.

Career Haag‚Äôs essays, books, and opinion address a broad range of topics. Haag‚Äôs most recent book, The Gunning of America: Business and the Making of American Gun Culture (Basic Books, 2016) highlights the gun industry rather than gun owners. The book delves into the historical archives of the Winchester and Colt‚Äôs corporations, and the ghostly legend of gun heiress Sarah Winchester. Gunning argues among other things that the gun mystique truly flourished and developed not on the frontier of the 1800s but in the urban, modern, ‚Äúpost-frontier‚Äù America of the 1900s. Haag pays particular attention to how the gun industry itself worked to build markets, both in the U.S. and, crucially, abroad. She argues that the gun shifted from something that Americans needed but didn‚Äôt especially love in the 1800s to something that they loved but didn‚Äôt especially need in the 1900s. The Gunning of America was praised as ‚Äúbeautifully composed,‚Äù ‚Äúbrilliant,‚Äù \\"remarkable,\\" and ‚Äúmasterful‚Äù in reviews, including The New Republic, The Washington Post, The Boston Globe, the San Francisco Chronicle, The New York Review of Books, Maclean's, Time, and others.

She was President and CEO of Warnaco Group Inc. from 1986 to 2001. She began her career as a buyer for department stores including Foley's and Macy's. Biography Born to a Jewish familyZweigenhaft, Richard L. and G. William Domhoff The New CEOs : Women, African American, Latino, and Asian American Leaders of Fortune 500 Companies Published: 2014-03-18 Publisher: Rowman & Littlefield PublishersFortune Magazine: \\"AMERICA'S MOST SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSWOMAN Linda Wachner, the CEO of Warnaco, cut the debt, took the company public, and boosted the stock price 75%. Any wonder her holding is worth $72 million? by Susan Caminiti June 15, 1992 in New York City and raised in Queens, New York, the daughter of Shirley and Herman Wachner. Her father was a fur salesman and her mother worked as a sales associate at Saks Fifth Avenue. In 1966, Wachner graduated with a B.A. in business administration from the University of Buffalo. After school, she held a succession of jobs first working for the Associated Merchandising Corporation, the New York City buying arm of Federated Department Stores; then as an assistant buyer at Foley's department store in Houston; and then as the bra and girdle buyer at Macy's in New York City. In 1974, she then took a marketing job at Warnaco and soon became a vice president, the company's first. In 1978, she went to work for Norton Simon tasked with turning around the money-losing U.S. division of Max Factor. In her second year, the division reported a $5 million profit. Max Factor was purchased by Esmark in 1983 and then after being purchased by Beatrice Foods in 1984, Wachner raised $280 million and tried to buy the company; Beatrice rejected her offer. In 1986, hearing that Warnaco's CEO, Robert Matura, wanted to take the company private, she partnered with Los Angeles investor Andrew Galef and offered $36 a share for the company. Although a bidding war broke out with competing bidder Matura, Wachner and Galef ultimately won the bid paying $46.50 a share or $550 million of which $500 million was borrowed via Drexel Burnham Lambert. Wachner effectively took control of the company becoming at the time the only female CEO of a Fortune 500 industrial company. In October 1991, Warnaco went public. She shrunk the business, selling off money losing lines to focus on two divisions: intimate apparel and menswear. During this time Warnaco had licensing agreements in menswear with Speedo, Calvin Klein, Christian Dior, Hathaway, Chaps by Ralph Lauren, and Jack Nicklaus; and in intimate apparel with Valentino, Ungaro, Scaasi, Bob Mackie, Fruit of the Loom, and Victoria's Secret. In 1990 Wachner sold 95% of its activewear division which included Speedo bathing suits for $85 million to a management group led by Wachner and several other Warnaco executives. In 1992, the company, renamed Authentic Fitness, went public.Wall Street Journal: \\"Warnaco to Acquire Authentic Fitness For $414 Million in a Sweetened Offer\\" By REBECCA QUICK November 17, 1999 In 1999, Warnaco reacquired Authentic Fitness for $504 million ($414 million in cash and $120 million in the assumption of debt). In 2000, Calvin Klein, Inc. sued both Warnaco and Wachner individually for trademark violations, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of contract. The lawsuit stemmed from Warnaco's selling Calvin Klein branded jeans and underwear to warehouse clubs such as Costco and BJ's Wholesale Club, which Klein contended devalued his brand name. Warnaco responded by saying that Klein had known of the sales to warehouse clubs all along and that he had failed to participate in meetings about the design of Warnaco's Calvin Klein clothing. The lawsuit was settled in 2001. Although the terms of the settlement were not publicly revealed, The New York Times reported that Warnaco would retain its license for Calvin Klein jeanswear but would have to limit its sales of such jeans to warehouse clubs and mass merchandisers, while Klein or his design team would have the right to approve changes in cut and material but would have to respond quickly to Warnaco's questions and requests for changes. Warnaco filed for bankruptcy protection on June 11, 2001. In November of that year, Wachner left her position as chief executive of Warnaco, but continued to provide transition assistance during the company's bankruptcy. Wachner's contract (which would otherwise have entitled her to a payment of $43.6 million on termination) had been voided as a result of the bankruptcy. Other In 1993, Fortune magazine listed Wachner among the seven \\"roughest, toughest, most intimidating bosses\\". Also on the list were T. J. Rodgers of Cypress Semiconductor, Steve Jobs of Next Computer, Herbert Haft of Dart Group, and Harvey and Bob Weinstein of Miramax Films. In 1996, Wachner was reported to be the highest-paid female corporate executive in the United States. Personal life In 1973, she married Seymour Appelbaum who was 31 years her senior; he died in 1983. They did not have any children.

Each church member declares one of the following tithing statuses, as defined by the church: * Full-tithe payers have paid one-tenth of their income as tithing. (Full-time missionaries and those completely dependent on church welfare assistance are also considered full tithe-payers.) * Part-tithe payers have paid tithing, but the amount is less than one-tenth of their income. * Non-tithe payers have not paid tithing during the year and (in the view of the church) are not exempt from paying tithing. * Previously, Exempt members had no income and paid no tithing, but they declare that they would have paid a full tithe if they had income. But it appears that this classification has been recently removed. Church members are invited to make a payment to correct any deficiency before the records are closed for year-end. If a church member does not participate or attend a tithing settlement meeting, the bishop or branch president declares a tithing status in their behalf. Payment of tithing is a core doctrine of the church for all members, including children.

The character debuted on November 16, 2010, and was portrayed by Jordi Vilasuso. Character history Griffin Castillo first appeared at Pine Valley Hospital and immediately began flirting with the married Amanda Martin and helped her repair her husband's car. He also assisted Opal Cortlandt after a heart related problem where he was revealed to be a Cardiologist. Later that day, Griffin is punched by Jake Martin, who reveals that Griffin is the man that stole his former wife Cara Finn, when all three had been involved in Doctors Without Borders. It was revealed on December 16, 2010, that Cara is actually Griffin's sister. Griffin goes to find Zach Slater, who called him to town to help expand the Miranda Center, but when he goes to Zach's house, his wife Kendall, tells him Zach has died in plane crash. Griffin saved his mentor Dr. David Hayward's life when he was admitted with a gunshot wound. Later, Dr. Angie Hubbard offered Griffin a job working at Pine Valley Hospital due to being short-staffed, Griffin accepted. Cara is revealed to be traveling on a fake passport, and ends up getting detained by Immigration. Later, Jake's brother, Tad, steps up to help her by saying Cara is his fianc√©e. Griffin goes along with the ruse to save Cara, keeping their mother, Leticia, at bay so that she can't stop the wedding. Later, he tells Jake to help Cara get a full-time job at the hospital to establish the cover of her marriage. Griffin finds out Kendall thinks Zach was murdered by his casino partners, and wants to help her out. He later realizes that Reverend Ricky Torres is trying to win over Kendall, and tries to be light about it. Griffin saves Kendall's life when he has to perform heart surgery on her in the back of an ambulance, and confides to her that he has been taking drugs from the hospital to give to clinics around the world that need the medicine. When he tries to investigate the casino partners on his own, he ends up getting beaten and lies to Kendall about it. Trying to save Kendall's life, Griffin tries to keep her at a distance, but Kendall is persistent, bidding at a bachelor auction for a date with him and even inviting him to her mother's wedding as her date. However, Griffin finds himself a target when Zach's partner, Diana Holden, is found dead in his room with evidence suggesting he was planning to leave town with her. Griffin insists he's innocent, but Kendall tells the police that Griffin stole drugs from the hospital, and he ends up in jail. While in lock-up, he is stabbed by a \\"guard,\\" and taken to the hospital. Cara gets Jake to lie about his diagnosis so that he won't go back to jail. However, when the lie is revealed, Griffin confesses to protect Cara. Before he can go back, Kendall helps him escape through a diversion Cara creates. She admits that she turned him in because she wanted answers about Zach's death, but realizes it has nothing to do with him, and she also knows who is responsible: Reverend Ricky Torres. Griffin is upset that Kendall is staying close to him to get a confession, and tries to convince her to stay away. She refuses, saying she needs answers. Griffin later tells Kendall's friend, Ryan Lavery, to keep an eye on her. Ryan, in turn, arranges a private jet to take Griffin anywhere he wants. However, Griffin decides to stay in town, because he's not ready to leave Kendall or risk her going up against Ricky. With help from Tad, Griffin evades the police and tracks Kendall and Ricky down to a yacht they had earlier taken out, where Kendall has just tricked Ricky into confessing that he is Zach's killer. In the ensuing skirmish, Griffin incapacitates Ricky but is talked out of killing him by Kendall, and Jesse arrives at that moment, first to arrest Ricky for kidnapping Kendall's younger sister, Bianca Montgomery, and her friend, Marissa Chandler, and then to arrest Griffin himself. Though Kendall begs him not to, Griffin goes with Jesse without a fight, promising Kendall that everything will work out. On September 12, 2011, it revealed that Griffin is alive and was working with Zach, Ryan, Greenlee, Kendall and Cara to bring David down.

Retrospective: a retrospective on the Warp machines. In 25 years of the international symposia on Computer architecture (selected papers) (ISCA '98), Gurindar S. Sohi (Ed.). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 45-47. The Warp projects were started in 1984 by H. T. Kung at Carnegie Mellon University. The Warp projects yielded research results, publications and advancements in general purpose systolic hardware design, compiler design and systolic software algorithms. There were three distinct machine designs known as the WW-Warp (Wire Wrap Warp), PC-Warp (Printed Circuit Warp), and iWarp (integrated circuit Warp, conveniently also a play on the ‚Äúi‚Äù for Intel).Thomas Gross and David R. O'Hallaron. iWarp: anatomy of a parallel computing system, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1998. Each successive generation became increasingly general- purpose by increasing memory capacity and loosening the coupling between processors. Only the original WW-Warp forced a truly lock step sequencing of stages, which severely restricted its programmability but was in a sense the purest ‚Äúsystolic-array‚Äù design. Warp machines were attached to Sun workstations (UNIX based). Software development for all models of Warp machines was done on Sun workstations. A research compiler, for a language known as ‚ÄúW2,‚Äù targeted all three machines and was the only compiler for the WW-Warp and PC-Warp while it served as an early compiler during development of the iWarp.Monica S. Lam. A Systolic Array Optimizing Compiler, Dordrecht, The Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1989. The production compiler for iWarp was a C and Fortran compiler based on the AT&T; pcc compiler for UNIX, ported under contract for Intel and then extensively modified and extend by Intel.Ali-Reza Adl-Tabatabai, Thomas Gross, Guei-Yuan Lueh and James Reinders.

In Proceedings of the IFIP WG10.3 Working Conference on Architectures and Compilation Techniques for Fine and Medium Grain Parallelism, Orlando, FL, pages 321-330. The WW-Warp and PC-Warp machines were systolic array computers with a linear array of ten or more cells, each of which is a programmable processor capable of performing 10 million single precision floating-point operations per second (10 MFLOPS). A 10-cell machine had a peak performance of 100 MFLOPS. The iWarp machines doubled this performance, delivering 20 MFLOPS single precision and supporting double precision floating point at half the performance.Intel Corp. iWarp Microprocessor (Part Number 318153), Hillsboro, Oregon, 1991. Technical Information, Order Number 281006. A two cell prototype of WW-Warp was complete at Carnegie Mellon in June 1985. Two essentially identical ten-cell WW-Warp were produced in 1986, one by Honeywell and one by G.E., for use at Carnegie Mellon University. The system from G.E. was delivered in February 1986; the system from Honeywell was delivered in June 1986. The first of the significantly redesign production model, the PC-Warp, was delivered by G.E. in April 1987. About twenty production models of the PC-Warp were produced and sold by G.E. during 1987-1989. The iWarp machines were based on a single-chip custom 700,000 transistor microprocessor, designed specifically for the Warp project, that utilized long-instruction-word (LIW) format instructions and tightly integrated communications with the computational processor.

The first iWarp system, a twelve node system, became operational in March 1990. After a number of stepping of the part, about 39 machines, consisting of ten or more C-Step iWarp chips running at 20 MHz, were produced and sold by Intel in 1992 and 1993 to universities, government agencies and industrial research laboratories.Encyclopedia of Parallel Computing, Padua, David (Ed.), 2011, See also *Systolic array *iWarp Notes External links *A Retrospective on the Warp Machines Category:Supercomputers Category:Parallel computing Category:Massively parallel computers ","title":"WARP (systolic array)"},{"id":"29596064","text":"Nathaniel Smith (1730 - 6 May 1794) was a naval officer, director of the Honourable East India Company and a politician who sat in the House of Commons variously between 1783 and 1794.

The issue is a complex one, to which federal and state governments as well as Indigenous groups have responded with various analyses and numerous programs and measures. , Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander prisoners represented 28% of the total adult prisoner population, while accounting for 3.3% of the general population. Explanations for this over- representation reflect the effect systemic racism has on the individual and the community, both historical (such as the Stolen Generations) and more recent. Whole communities have been traumatised, and other issues such as police brutality, disconnection from land, and poor socioeconomic situation have contributed to the crime rate. Issues associated to low socioeconomic status (inadequate housing, low academic achievement, poor health, poor parenting, etc.) to all types of crime are well-established, and disadvantage is greater in Indigenous communities than non-Indigenous ones in Australia. Background Many sources report over-representation of Indigenous offenders at all stages of the criminal justice system. Also by chapter in html, see Chapter 2 , Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander prisoners represented 28% of the total adult prisoner population, while accounting for 3.3% of the general population. The links between lower socioeconomic status and the associated issues that come with it (inadequate housing, low academic achievement, poor health, poor parenting, etc.) to all types of crime are well-established, if complex,Wild and Anderson, p.223 (Whole document here.) and disadvantage is greater in Indigenous communities than non-Indigenous ones in Australia. These reasons have been well documented, as pointed out by National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services (NATSILS) and the Aboriginal Legal Service of Western Australia (ALSWA). According to ALSWA these \\"have been repeatedly examined by numerous federal and state inquiries\\", and the reasons fall into two categories: \\"The first category are underlying factors that contribute to higher rates of offending (e.g., socio-economic disadvantage, impact of colonisation and dispossession, Stolen Generations, intergenerational trauma, substance abuse, homelessness and overcrowding, lack of education and physical and mental health issues). The second category is structural bias or discriminatory practices within the justice system itself (i.e., the failure to recognise cultural differences and the existence of laws, processes and practices within the justice system that discriminate, either directly or indirectly, against Aboriginal people such as over-policing practices by Western Australia Police, punitive bail conditions imposed by police and inflexible and unreasonable exercises or prosecutorial decisions by police).\\" The effect that systemic racism has on the individual and the community, both historical (such as the Stolen Generations) and recent cannot be discounted or underestimated. Whole communities have been traumatised, and other issues such as police brutality and disconnection from land have contributed. A submission by Mick Gooda to a 2016 government report emphasised that the rates of crime and incarceration of Indigenous people could not be viewed separately from history or the current social context. He referred to referred to Don Weatherburn's work, which showed four key risk factors for involvement in the criminal justice system: poor parenting (particularly child neglect and abuse); poor school performance and/or early school leaving; unemployment; and drug and alcohol abuse. Indigenous Australians fare much worse than non-Indigenous citizens in relation to these four factors, and mental illness, including foetal alcohol spectrum disorders, and overcrowded housing also play a part. Crime-related issues =Violent crime= The main source of information on homicides is the National Homicide Monitoring Program (NHMP), which was established in 1990 at the Australian Institute of Criminology. A 2001 study by Jenny Mouzos, using data from 1 July 1989 to 30 June 2000, showed that 15.7 percent of homicide offenders and 15.1 percent of homicide victims were Indigenous, while census statistics showed the rate of indigeneity of the population at around 2 percent in 2000 (since found to be too low a figure). The statistics were imperfect also because NHMP data is gathered from police records, which may not always identify race accurately, but an earlier review had reported \\"...although the statistics are imperfect, they are sufficient to demonstrate the disproportionate occurrence of violence in the Indigenous communities of Australia and the traumatic impact on Indigenous people.(Memmott et al. 2001, p. 6)\\". The study reported that the homicides were largely unpremeditated, and most occurred within the family environment, with alcohol involved.Mouzos, Jenny. , Australian Institute of Criminology, June 2001, accessed 11 November 2010. by WebCite on 11 November 2010. . ISSN 0817-8542. See accompanying webpage here, archived 11 November 2010. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Women‚Äôs Task Force on Violence (2000, p. ix) reported that \\"The high incidence of violent crime in some Indigenous communities, particularly in remote and rural regions, is exacerbated by factors not present in the broader Australian community...Dispossession, cultural fragmentation and marginalisation have contributed to the current crisis in which many Indigenous persons find themselves; high unemployment, poor health, low educational attainment and poverty have become endemic elements in Indigenous lives...\\". Age-standardised figures in 2002 showed that 20 percent of Indigenous people were the victims of physical or threatened violence in the previous 12 months, while the rate for non-Indigenous people was 9 percent.4102.0 ‚Äì Australian Social Trends, 2005: Crime and Justice: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People: Contact with the Law, Australian Bureau of Statistics, 12 July 2005, accessed 11 November 2010. by WebCite on 11 November 2010. In 2011‚Äì2012, the percentage of Aboriginal homicide offenders decreased to 11 percent and victims to 13 percent. =Family violence= The 2001 homicide study found that most occurred within the domestic setting. In 2002 the Western Australia government looked into the issue and conducted an inquiry, known as the Gordon Inquiry after its lead investigator, Aboriginal magistrate Sue Gordon. The report, Putting the picture together: Inquiry into response by government agencies to complaints of family violence and child abuse in Aboriginal communities, said that \\"[t]he statistics paint a frightening picture of what could only be termed an 'epidemic' of family violence and child abuse in Aboriginal communities.\\" Family violence and sexual assault were at \\"crisis levels\\" in the Indigenous community in 2004, according to Monique Keel of the Australian Institute of Family Studies. (HTML version here) =Child abuse= The incidence of child abuse in Indigenous communities, including sexual abuse and neglect, is high in comparison with non-Indigenous communities. However the data is limited, with most coming from child protection reports.Wild and Anderson, pp. 234, 239. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare gathered data for 2008‚Äì2009 on children aged 0‚Äì16 who were the subject of a confirmed child abuse report. It showed that Indigenous children accounted for 25 percent of the reports, despite making up only 4.6 percent of all Australian children; there were 37.7 reports per 1,000 of Indigenous children and 5 reports per 1,000 of non-Indigenous children, that is, Indigenous children were 7.5 times more likely to be the subject of a child abuse report.Berlyn and Bromfield, p. 1. A 2010 report showed that child sexual abuse was the least common form of abuse of Indigenous children, in contrast to media portrayals. Incidents of all types of child abuse in Indigenous communities may be under-reported, for several possible reasons, including fear of the authorities; denial; fears that the child may be taken away; and social pressure.Berlyn and Bromfield, p. 2. The 2007 Little Children are Sacred report cited evidence that \\"child maltreatment is disproportionately reported among poor families and, particularly in the case of neglect, is concentrated among the poorest of the poor\\", and that socio-economic disadvantage is \\"closely related with family violence, being both a cause of child abuse... and a form of child abuse and neglect in itself\\". The Indigenous community is significantly poorer than the non-Indigenous community in Australia.Wild and Anderson, p. 224. The Australian Human Rights Commission's Social Justice Report 2008 said that, despite the likelihood of under-reporting, the 2005‚àí2006 ABS statistics for confirmed child abuse did not appear to support the \\"allegations of endemic child abuse in NT remote communities that was the rationale for the Northern Territory National Emergency Response\\". =Alcohol abuse= There is a link between alcohol abuse and violence in Indigenous communities, but the relationship is complex and it is not straightforward causality.Wild and Anderson, p. 226. Some of the \\"underlying issues associated with alcohol use and dependence [include] educational failure, family breakdown, the lack of meaningful employment and economic stagnation\\" (Homel,Lincoln & Herd 1999; Hazelhurst1997). The 2001 homicide study reported that over four out of five Indigenous homicides involved either the victim or offender, or both, drinking at the time of the incident. A 2019 report shows a decline in the use of alcohol, with a greater abstention rate than among non-Indigenous people, as well as in tobacco use. =Illicit drug use= There is a link between illicit drugs and crime. The 2004 Drug Use Monitoring in Australia (DUMA) annual report found that \\"37 percent of police detainees attributed some of their criminal activity to illicit drug use\\". However the relationship is complex. The drugs most often associated with violent crime (including domestic violence) in the whole Australian population are alcohol and methamphetamine. Data from 2004‚Äì2007 showed that illicit drug use by Indigenous people over 14 years old was about twice as high as that of the general population. The data showed that 28 percent of Indigenous people aged 15 and above in non-remote areas had used illicit drugs in the previous 12 months, while the rate for non-Indigenous people in that age group in all areas was 13 percent. The illicit drugs most used by Indigenous people are cannabis, amphetamines, analgesics, and ecstasy. The increased usage may be related to the history of dispossession of Indigenous people and their subsequent socioeconomic disadvantage. Since the 1980s cannabis use by Indigenous people has increased substantially. Originally published as published as: Catto, M. , & Thomson, N. J. (2008). Review of illicit drug use among Indigenous peoples. Australian Indigenous Health Bulletin, 8(4), 32p. A 2006 study investigating drug use among Indigenous people in remote and rural communities showed that, while alcohol remained the primary concern, the \\"often heavy use of cannabis and increasing signs of amphetamine use\\" was having a negative impact on the communities. Drug offences constituted a very small proportion of charges in rural communities, but substance abuse primarily involved alcohol, cannabis, petrol and other solvents, and, increasingly, amphetamines. A 2019 review reported that in 2016, 27 percent of Indigenous Australians used an illicit drug in the previous year, which was 1.8 times higher than for non-Indigenous Australians, at 15.3 percent. Cannabis use was especially prevalent: 19.4 percent had used cannabis in the last 12 months (1.9 times higher than non-Indigenous Australians, at 10.2%). 10.6 percent of Indigenous people had used a pharmaceutical for non-medical use (non-Indigenous 4.6 percent) and 3.1 percent had used methamphetamines (non-Indigenous 1.4 percent). The relationship to crime was not included in this report. The relationship between use of illicit drugs and crime, excluding possession of the drug, is not clear. Arrests of consumers (whole Australian population) still constituted around 80 percent of all arrests in 2009‚Äì10, and cannabis-related crimes accounted for 67 per cent. =Victims of crime= Indigenous Australians are over-represented as victims of crime, in particular assault. A 2016 ABS report found that they are more likely to be victims of assault than non-Indigenous people by ratios of 2.6 (in New South Wales), 6 (in South Australia), and 5.9 (in Northern Territory). Indigenous women are highly over- represented this figure, accounting for a higher proportion of assault victims than the non-Indigenous category. Detainment and imprisonment =General statistics= In 2009, ABS figures showed that Indigenous people accounted for 25 percent of Australia's prison population.4517.0 ‚Äì Prisoners in Australia, 2009: Indigenous prisoners, Australian Bureau of Statistics, 10 December 2009, accessed 11 November 2010. by WebCite on 11 November 2010. The age- standardised imprisonment rate for Indigenous people was 1,891 people per 100,000 of adult population, while for non-Indigenous people it was 136, which meant that the imprisonment rate for Indigenous people was 14 times higher than that of non-Indigenous people. The imprisonment rate for Indigenous people had increased from 1,248 per 100,000 of adult population in 2000, while it remained stable for non-Indigenous people.4517.0 ‚Äì Prisoners in Australia, 2009: Imprisonment rates, Australian Bureau of Statistics, 10 December 2009, accessed 11 November 2010. by WebCite on 11 November 2010. Indigenous men accounted for 92 percent of all Indigenous prisoners, while for non-Indigenous people the rate was 93 percent.4517.0 ‚Äì Prisoners in Australia, 2009: Sex, Australian Bureau of Statistics, 10 December 2009, accessed 11 November 2010. by WebCite on 11 November 2010. 74 percent of Indigenous prisoners had been imprisoned previously, while the rate for non-Indigenous prisoners was 50 percent.4517.0 ‚Äì Prisoners in Australia, 2009: Prior imprisonment, Australian Bureau of Statistics, 10 December 2009, accessed 11 November 2010. by WebCite on 11 November 2010. Chris Graham of the National Indigenous Times calculated in 2008 that the imprisonment rate of Indigenous Australians was five times higher than that of black men in South Africa at the end of apartheid.Graham, Chris. \\"Editorial: Deafening silence\\", National Indigenous Times, 9 July 2009, accessed 10 November 2010. by WebCite on 11 November 2010. In 2014 in Western Australia, one in thirteen of all Aboriginal adult males was in prison. According prison reform campaigner Gerry Georgatos, this is the highest jailing rate in the world. The 2016 Australian Census recorded 798,400 Indigenous people (either Aboriginal Australians, Torres Strait Islander or both) in Australia, accounting for 3.3 percent of the population. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reported that the total Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population in Australia aged 18 years and over as of June 2018 was approximately 2 percent, while Indigenous prisoners accounted for just over a quarter (28%) of the adult prison population. Many sources report and discuss the over-representation of Indigenous Australians in Australian prisons. The Attorney-General for Australia commissioned the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) in October 2016 to examine the factors leading to the disproportionate numbers of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in Australian prisons, and to look at ways of reforming legislation which might ameliorate this \\"national tragedy\\". The result of this in-depth enquiry was a report titled Pathways to Justice ‚Äì Inquiry into the Incarceration Rate of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, which was received by the Attorney-General in December 2017 and tabled in Parliament on 28 March 2018. The report listed 13 recommendations, covering many aspects of the legal framework and police and justice procedures, including that fine default should not result in the imprisonment. Summary report PDF Full report PDF =Health Effects from Incarceration= Negative health effects have been well researched and include mental health and well-being issues, grief and loss, violence and the need for family and community. Social Justice Commissioner, Mick Gooda said in 2014 that over the previous 15 years, Indigenous incarceration had increased by 57%. A large number of Indigenous Australians in imprisonment experience many problems, including malnutrition, diseases, lack of opportunity, and erosion of their individual identity. Statistics have shown that Indigenous people are 13 times more likely to be imprisoned than non-Indigenous people. Imprisonment can be a traumatic experience for any persons. There are many other factors associated with mental health effects while in custody, including psychological distress, life stresses, discrimination and domestic violence. A study has shown that 50% of males and 85% of Indigenous females reported medium or higher levels of psychological distress. =Deaths in custody= Death rates in prison are cause for concern. National reconciliation between Indigenous and non- Indigenous people has been tainted with suspicion that the running of the criminal justice system was against Indigenous Australians. After a large number of Aboriginal deaths in custody in 1987, the Federal Government ordered the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. The 1991 report of the same name found that the death rate in custody was similar for both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people, and that the high number of Indigenous deaths in custody was due to the disproportionate number of Indigenous people in prison custody relative to the number of non-Indigenous people‚Äîa factor of 29 according to a 1988 report by the Commission. RCIADIC concluded that the deaths were not caused by deliberate killing by police and prison officers, but that \\"glaring deficiencies existed in the standard of care afforded to many of the deceased\\". It reported that \\"Aboriginal people died in custody at the same rate as non-Aboriginal prisoners, but they were far more likely to be in prison than non-Aboriginal people\\", and that child removal was a \\"significant precursor to these high rates of imprisonment\\". The issue resurfaced in 2004 when an Indigenous man, Mulrunji Doomadgee, died in custody in Palm Island, Queensland, an incident that caused riots on the island.\\"Police accused of Aborigine death\\", BBC News, 27 September 2006, accessed 12 November 2010. The police officer who had custody of Doomadgee was charged with manslaughter, and was found not guilty in June 2007.Marriner, Cosima. \\"Calm in Palm Island after verdict\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, 20 June 2007, accessed 13 November 2010. by WebCite on 13 November 2010.

Suvendrini Perera, a member of the working party that reported to the West Australian Attorney-General on the coronial findings into the death of a Wongai elder who died in the back of a police van in Perth in 2008, wrote of \\"a culture of racism, cronyism and cover-up\\" evident within the Australian criminal justice system, targeting Aboriginal people as well as Sudanese Australians and asylum seekers. =Women in prison= A 2017 report by the Human Rights Law Centre and Change the Record Coalition said that the lack of data on female prisoners and improvements which may flow from such data, led to higher rates of imprisonment. Indigenous women are 21 times more likely to be imprisoned than non-Indigenous women, the rate of imprisonment has grown faster than any other segment of the prison population. The rate of female Indigenous imprisonment has increased 148% since the 1991 RCIDIAC deaths in custody report. Among the 2017 report's 13 recommendations are that state and territory governments should establish community-led prevention and early intervention programs to reduce violence against women; the removal of laws that disproportionately criminalise Indigenous women (such as imprisonment for non-payment of fines); and that a Custody Notification Schemes (CNS) should be set up in every jurisdiction. The 2018 ALRC Pathways to Justice report said that \\"Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women constitute 34% of the female prison population. In 2016, the rate of imprisonment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women (464.8 per 100,000) was not only higher than that of non-Indigenous women (21.9 per 100,000), but was also higher than the rate of imprisonment of non-Indigenous men (291.1 per 100,000)\\". Also \\"[Indigenous] women were 21.2 times more likely to be in prison than non-Indigenous women\\" (Summary, p.8). The majority of female Indigenous prisoners have experienced physical or sexual abuse, and the rate of family violence is higher in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities than the general population. Added to this they have often suffered other trauma, housing insecurity, mental illness and other disabilities. The incarceration of women means that their own (80% are mothers) and other children, and others who they may care for, are put at risk. One of the ALRC recommendations pertains to the amendment of fine enforcement procedures so they do not allow for imprisonment, as women are often in prison for this reason in some states, and Recommendation 11 pertains specifically to procedures relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women. Research into women in the criminal justice system in New South Wales commissioned by the Keeping Women Out of Prison Coalition (KWOOP) and published in March 2020, found that in the six years between March 2013 and June 2019, the number of incarcerated women had risen by 33%, to 946, and of these, almost a third were Indigenous. The overall growth of female prisoners was not due to a rise in crimes committed, but due to a 66% increase in the proportion of women on remand. The wait for bail of Indigenous women was between 34 and 58 days, but the majority of women were not given a sentence. The report also indicated that many more Indigenous than non-Indigenous women were sent to prison for similar crimes. The rate of imprisonment of all women had been rising, but for Indigenous women there had been a 49% increase since 2013, while for others the increase was 6%. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner June Oscar said \\"urgent action\\" was needed. =Refusal of bail= New South Wales studies in 1976 and 2004 found that Aboriginal people were more likely to be refused bail than the general population, being instead detained on remand awaiting trial. (1976) 1(4) University of New South Wales Law Journal 298. This is despite provisions in the Bail Amendment (Repeat Offenders) Act 2002 (NSW) aiming to \\"increase access to bail for Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders\\". =Children in detention= In 2019, the Australian Medical Association reported that around 600 children below the age of 14 are prisoners in youth detention each year, and 70 percent of them are Aboriginal or Islander children. Overall, Indigenous children are around 5 percent of the total youth population in Australia, but make up about 60 percent of the children in prisons. The Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous peoples from the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child had urged Australia to increase the age of criminal responsibility (10 years old in all states ), saying that children \\"should be detained only as a last resort, which is not the case today for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children\\". In 2018 it was revealed that all the children in detention in the Northern Territory were Indigenous. =Prisoners with disabilities= In August 2018, a senior research officer from Human Rights Watch reported, \\"I visited 14 prisons across Australia, and heard story after story of Indigenous people with disabilities, whose lives have been cycles of abuse and imprisonment, without effective support\\". Responses =Circle sentencing= Circle sentencing is a process which puts Aboriginal adult offenders before a circle of elders, members of the community, police and the judiciary, who decide on the sentence, rather than a traditional courtroom. This alternative method was first trialled in New South Wales in 2003, with more than 1,200 people completing the program by February 2019. The process is used for a range of offences, such as those relating to driving, drug and alcohol, but not for serious indictable offences such as murder or sexual assault. Informed by the restorative justice approach, circle sentencing seeks to integrate Aboriginal customary tradition into the legal process. The NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research (BOCSAR) analysed the program in 2008, looking at 68 participants, compared to a control group who had been dealt with through the local court. It found that the program had failed to reduce recidivism and showed that the program had not addressed the root causes of the offenders' criminal behaviour. In 2019, Director Don Weatherburn said that the program had had limited resources at that time, and the program had since been improved to deal with the causes of offending. He was confident that the forthcoming new review, with results due in 2020, would show more positive results. Anecdotally, the circles had seen a huge reduction in reoffending. =Focus on socio-economic factors= Reports on the rates of Indigenous crime have also focused on reducing risk by targeting the socio-economic factors that may contribute to such trends. Such factors include education, housing and the lack of employment opportunities for Indigenous Australians. =Police programs= As of 2020, various programs in New South Wales have been having a positive effect on keeping Indigenous people out of prison. In Bourke, a project called Maranguka Justice Reinvestment has police officers meeting with local Indigenous leaders each day, helping to identify at-risk youth, and includes giving free driving lessons to young people. There have been reductions in domestic violence and juvenile offending, and an increase in school retention. Project Walwaay in Dubbo sees an Aboriginal youth team help to build relationships and engage young people in activities on a Friday night, which is now the second lowest day of crime, compared with being the busiest day before. The activities are also a pathway to the Indigenous Police Recruitment Delivery Our Way (IPROWD), an 18-week program run through TAFE NSW, which encourages young people to become police officers. This was first run in Dubbo in 2008 and has now been expanded to other locations across the state.

The paper is printed once a week, Wednesday, with special editions printed occasionally. The current editor-in- chief is Cassidy Alexander. The newspaper is divided into four sections, including news, sports, arts and culture, and opinion, and is printed in color. The name \\"Kaimin\\" is derived from a Salish Indian word and means \\"something written\\" or a \\"message\\".  History  = 1898 and early 1900s = The Kaimin has been in publication since 1898 and the first issue sold for 15 cents. Charles Pixley was the first editor of the Kaimin. The monthly publication combined artful literary styling of student writers with colorful gossip of campus life. From June 1898 until 1900, the Kaimin was formatted as a monthly magazine. The first weekly edition of the paper was printed in September 1900. In March 1927, the Kaimin began printing twice a week, Tuesday and Friday. The publication changed to daily printing beginning March 1938, and did so until World War II. = 1930s = Throughout the Great Depression, the Kaimin only mentioned it twice. The first was in 1932 when the football team lost money. A reason cited was the nationwide economic depression. The Kaimin mentioned the depression when it reported in 1933 that UM professors questioned President Franklin Roosevelt's decision to have a national banking holiday. In 1938, the Kaimin changed physical location. It moved from the structure known as \\"The Shack\\". The building was built to house Student Army Training Corps during World War I. The Shack proved to be an inefficient facility for the newspaper, so it moved into the newly constructed journalism building. = 1940s = Throughout World War II, the staff consisted mostly of women. Both the newspaper and the university supported the war, but both felt the war's effect with shrinking enrollment, staff, and budget. The war caused the Kaimin to scale back its production and to revert to publishing the paper twice a week, then just weekly in 1943. This continued until January 1948, when daily publishing Tuesday through Friday resumed. Because campus and paper were predominantly female during the war, much of the Kaimins news focused on women. A regular column, \\"Women in the News\\", ran in 1945. As enrollment rose, the budget for paper became bigger and the Publication Board voted unanimously to increase the salaries for Kaimin employees. The editor's salary increased from $35 a month to $70. In 1949, pressure from the campus administration led to confiscation and destruction of an issue of the Kaimin, which carried a cartoon depicting the Montana Board of Education as rats gnawing at a bag of university funds. Carroll O'Connor, later to become television's Archie Bunker, and Bill Smurr resigned their editing jobs in protest. = 1950s = On January 17, 1950, the Kaimin was linked to the United Press International Teletype, making it the only college paper in the Rocky Mountains to have the capability to print the latest world news. In 1952, a letter to the editor claimed the Kaimin was being run by the journalism faculty and not by journalism students. The editorial the next day called the letter libelous, but no legal action was taken, eliminating the possibility of a newspaper suing itself for libel. The Kaimin announced it would move to an afternoon schedule early in 1956. Editor Kim Forman wrote, \\"By changing to a p.m. paper, the Kaimin will be both better written and better read.\\" A month later, the Kaimin abandoned the format and returned to the morning. In 1958, the newspaper defeated over 100 schools and took first place in a national news- writing competition. = 1960s = During the 1960s, the Kaimins editor, David Rorvik, received heavy criticism for the editorials published. In October 1965, Rorvik chastised the Roman Catholic Church for its stand on birth control with an editorial titled, \\"The Contemporary Lay\\". With the controversial editorials, more than 50 students signed a letter asking for Rorvik's dismissal. Montana Gov. Tim Babcock criticized the paper's view in a phone call to the Kaimin, saying, \\"I'm the most broad-minded person who's ever sat in this office, but I think the line should be drawn somewhere above that.\\" Even though Rorvik's editorship ended in 1966, controversial news in the Kaimin did not. In February 1967, the paper reported that one or two students visited the UM Health Service each week for treatment of venereal diseases. The number increased to six students a week after spring break and Christmas vacation. = 1970s = At the beginning of the decade, the Central Board suggested the resignation of UC Program Director Lee Tickell in October 1970 after he could not account for a $26,000 deficit in the Program Council's budget, causing criticism from the Kaimin. Five days later, the Kaimin and editor T.J. Gilles retracted statements made in an editorial that called Tickell a liar, a two-bit huckster, and a tin-horn gambler. Tickell sued, but the suit was dropped. In 1971, the paper's budget showed a $1,000 deficit due to phone bills. Another controversy occurred in 1974. when editor Carey Yunker wrote an editorial calling Printing Services Director Al Madison a \\"congenital liar\\". Madison filed a $102,000 libel suit. The University of Montana settled the libel suit without a trial and paid Madison more than $10,000. = 1980s and 1990s = Starting in January 1983, the Kaimin printed off campus for the first time since publication began, but was still printed in black and white. The Missoulian took the printing duties, and the change created a tabloid- sized page. Later in 1984, the Kaimin apologized after negative reactions to a satirical issue titled the \\"Montana Enquirer\\", which poked fun at a local political activist's weight. The story was titled, \\"Reporter squished by 300-pound Republican\\". To cut costs, the Kaimin reduced the number of issues printed from 7,000 to 6,000 in 1991. = 2000s = In 2009, Bobby Hauck became the subject of national controversy when he refused to take questions from the Kaimin following the paper's story about an alleged assault by two Grizzly football players. = 2010s = In the fall of 2010, the Kaimin changed to a tabloid format once a week, known as the Friday Kaimin. The new format put a focus on long-form feature stories, in a more magazine-like fashion. After a significant budget deficit in the spring of 2015, the Kaimin permanently moved to a weekly publication schedule to cut costs and focus on web-first reporting.  Location  The Kaimin office is located in the University of Montana School of Journalism building on the second floor.  Format  Throughout the 1930s, the Kaimin was formatted in broadsheet, eight-column form. In 1939, the Kaimin changed to a five-column daily paper for two academic quarters. The format change was considered a success and was made permanent. In the spring semester of 2015, due to budget constraints, the Kaimin reduced its publication to once a week. The Kaimin now publishes weekly on Wednesdays during the academic year and daily online.  Web presence  The paper was available to the world over the Internet, known as Kaimin On Line, in 1994. Since then, the online website has been referred to as just the Montana Kaimin. In fall 2010, weekly online video \\"webisodes\\" were added, including AJ Versus, in which a staff member faces a University of Montana athlete in different challenges, and Kaimin Desk Concerts, a live musical performance in the Kaimin offices. The Kaimin now publishes daily on its website, which includes web-unique media and breaking news. Missed print dates The printing of the Kaimin was delayed a week in May 1922 due to workers striking at the Missoulian Publishing Company.

The squadron then undertook dive bombing missions against marshalling yards and airfields and attacked Axis communications during April and May from its new station, an advanced landing groundRust, p. 69 at RAF High Halden, to help prepare for the invasion of Normandy. The squadron escorted troop carrier formations on D Day and the following day as the formations dropped paratroopers on the Cotentin Peninsula. For the remainder of June, it attacked rail lines, troop concentrations, bridges and transport. The squadron moved to France in July and, from its base at Cretteville, took part in operations that resulted in the Allied breakthrough at St Lo. The squadron continued to fly escort, interdiction and close air support missions during the Allied drive across France and into Germany throughout 1944-45. The squadron received a Distinguished Unit Citation for its actions between 24 December 1944 and 2 January 1945, when it supported the Seventh Army attacking railroads and rolling stock, other vehicles and artillery formations. It also destroyed numerous Luftwaffe fighters while undertaking defensive operations during the German-launched Operation Bodenplatte, an attack concentrating on forward Allied air bases in an attempt by the Luftwaffe to attain air superiority in the area of the Battle of the Bulge. In March, the squadron attacked German forces attempting to withdraw across the Rhine River, destroying motor transport and hampering the withdrawal efforts, earning a second Distinguished Unit Citation. The following month, the squadron attacked German airfields near Munich and Ingolstadt, engaging aircraft and supporting the advance of Allied ground forces in the area, earning a third award of the Distinguished Unit Citation. The squadron was also awarded the French Croix de Guerre with Palm by the Government of France for its assistance in the liberation of France. The squadron was credited with the destruction of 29.5 enemy aircraft during the war.Newton and Senning, p. 634 The squadron remained in Germany after VE Day until July 1945, when it returned to the United States, where it was inactivated on 7 November 1945.

His quick bowling and aggressive nature could strike fear into many an amateur player. This was summed up in the early 90s whilst playing for the 5-finger team Darcy Lever in the BDCA when he won the 'Professional of the Year' for an outstanding season. The 2000s proved to be an up and down decade for Townley; his increasing age and years of wear and tear has cost him his pace but he now uses the guile and experience that decades of league cricket has brought. He has also battled against his weight but toward the end of the decade had lost a significant amount and returned to league cricket with BDCA team Walshaw CC, winning another league title in his first year back. This feat brought him to the attention of Woodbank CC who offered him a large fee to be their professional for the 2010 season.

History  During the Ottoman period (15th‚Äì1912) the village enjoyed a special administrative status as part of the Himara region. In 1742 the neighbouring Muslim Albanian village of Borsh attacked Piqeras making some Albanian speaking Orthodox Christians flee abroad to southern Italy where they founded the village of Villa Badessa. In 1744 an attack by Muslim Albanian groups forced the Greek- speaking inhabitants in Piqeras to leave the village. In 1798 the village became the target of an attack by the forces of Ali Pasha who managed to control the southern part of Himara. In 1875, some Albanian speaking families with Piqeras heritage from Villa Badessa decided to relocate to Nea Pikerni, a settlement founded by the Greek state in the Peloponnese which after some time was abandoned due to economic and relocation hardships.Kallivretakis, Leonidas (2003). \\"ŒùŒ≠Œ± Œ†ŒπŒ∫Œ≠œÅŒΩŒ∑ ŒîŒÆŒºŒøœÖ ŒíŒøœÖœÄœÅŒ±œÉŒØœâŒΩ: œÑŒø œáœÅŒøŒΩŒπŒ∫œå ŒµŒΩœåœÇ ŒøŒπŒ∫ŒπœÉŒºŒøœç œÑŒ∑œÇ Œ†ŒµŒªŒøœÄŒøŒΩŒΩŒÆœÉŒøœÖ œÑŒøŒΩ 19Œø Œ±ŒπœéŒΩŒ± (Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ∑ œÄŒµœÅŒπœÄŒ≠œÑŒµŒπŒ± ŒµŒΩœåœÇ œÄŒªŒ∑Œ∏œÖœÉŒºŒøœç) [Nea Pikerni of Demos Vouprassion: The chronicle of a 19th century Peloponnesian settlement (and the adventures of a population)]\\".

The house was originally built in 1780, with subsequent work in 1823 and a single story addition in the 20th century. Significance The building is a good example of attempts to adapt the high style of Philadelphia architecture to buildings in a rural setting. The Greek Revival detailing of the exterior, and the interior details of the window and door frames and the mantelpiece, along with its sensitivity to proportion, make it unique to rural southeastern Pennsylvania. The John Fitch Steamboat Museum is located at this site, which includes a working model of the commercial steamboat that Fitch operated on the Delaware River in 1790.  History  Rear elevation Craven Hall is associated with families that were part of the American Revolution and prominent in local Pennsylvania history. The house was built for John Craven who was the founder of Johnsville, Pennsylvania. Later, the house passed down to members of the VanSant, Longstreth, Hart and Bennett families.  Construction  The house is two and a half stories, built with stone walls finished with stucco. The central hallway and staircase are flanked by parlor rooms on either side. A side wing built to the same height as the main building has quarter-round windows on each side of the chimney. The building retains the original fireplaces and the kitchen hearth. The spring house in the rear yard is built underground with stone and stucco walls, and accessed by a staircase.

The Swedish Government invited Hans Blix to set up and chair the Commission. He presented the composition of the Commission to the public on 16 December 2003 and explained what he saw were major tasks for it. The Commission commenced its work against the background of more than a half-century's striving for non-proliferation, arms control and disarmament of weapons of mass destruction. While there has been much success and progress, especially after the end of the Cold War, there have been many difficulties and disappointments in recent years. The technical evolution and the access to knowledge have also reduced some barriers to the acquisition of weapons. The possession and potential use of weapons of mass destruction by states or non- state actors remain ever-present risks. The slowdown and stalemate in the fields of non-proliferation, arms control and disarmament needs to be reversed and the momentum needs to be regained.

Collins merged with Harper & Row in 1990, forming a new publisher named HarperCollins. History The company had to overcome many early obstacles, and Charles Chalmers left the business in 1825. The company eventually found success in 1841 as a printer of Bibles, and, in 1848, Collins's son Sir William Collins developed the firm as a publishing venture, specialising in religious and educational books. The company was renamed William Collins, Sons and Co Ltd. in 1868.Keir, David (1952). The House of Collins: The Story of a Scottish Family of Publishers from 1789 to the Present Day. Collins: London.

Collins & Co., or William Collins & Company, Collins & Co., etc., before \\"sometime in the 1860s\\", then \\"William Collins Sons and Co.\\", LCCN: nr2001-16410.) Although the early emphasis of the company had been on religion and education, Collins also published more widely. In 1917, with Sir Godfrey Collins in charge, the firm started publishing fiction. Collins Crime Club (1930‚Äì94) published all but the first six of Agatha Christie's novels, starting in 1926, as well as the British editions of Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe books and many others from the Golden Age of Detective Fiction. Upon purchasing the rights to the works of C. S. Lewis, Fount was established as Collins's religion imprint. Collins ultimately became a diverse and prolific company, publishing a wide range of titles, including many aimed at a juvenile audience, such as the books of Dr. Seuss (in the Commonwealth) and Racey Helps in the 1950s. By the late 1970s, Collins was also responsible for publishing the long-running American Children's Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew series in the United Kingdom. These were firstly published in a series of digest size hardbacks akin to their American style. Paperbacks (of a 'normal' rather than 'digest' size) soon followed from Collins' Armada Books imprint, although the series as published in Great Britain follow a different numbering system to the accepted American one. Collins's Armada Books imprint also published similar series, such as the Three Investigators, alongside such British stalwarts as Biggles, Billy Bunter, and Paddington Bear, and such well-loved authors as Enid Blyton, Malcolm Saville and Diana Pullein-Thompson. In 1953, Collins launched its Fontana Books series.Richard Williams, FONTANA BOOKS, 1-500: 1953-1961, South Humberside, Dragonby Press, 1997 (British Paperback Checklist, 14). Later Fontana Books became a Collins imprint complete with its own series, including the Fontana Monarchs, the Fontana African Fiction seriesJosh MacPhee, 251: Fontana Africa (compiled), justseeds.org.

On 8 February 2013 it was announced that some parts of the Collins non-fiction imprint would be merged with the HarperPress imprint to form a new William Collins imprint. Collins Education Collins Education is the third-largest educational publishing house in the United Kingdom, and an imprint of HarperCollins Publishers. It publishes print and interactive digital products for primary and secondary teachers in the United Kingdom and internationally. Notable publications include Haralambos and Holborn's Sociology, Themes and Perspectives, the guided reading scheme Collins Big Cat, and the Key Stage 3 Maths series New Maths Frameworking.

Located at the junction of City Route 62 and City Route 42 in the city's Fort Rouge neighbourhood, the intersection is a major traffic hub through which most traffic between downtown and the southwest quadrant of the city must pass, but is infamous for being complex and difficult for unfamiliar or distracted drivers to navigate correctly. The intersection is defined by two one-way segments of Route 42, which has the street names Pembina Highway west of the intersection, and Donald Street and McMillan Avenue east of the intersection, intersecting Route 62 (Osborne Street) in a rhomboid shape. City Route 95 (Corydon Avenue) does not directly enter the junction of the two routes, instead beginning at the southwestern corner of the rhomboid, although traffic to and from the terminus of Corydon Avenue also funnels through the junction. An interchange for the Osborne- Pembina-Corydon intersection was proposed by the Metro Winnipeg council during the 1960s, however this was abandoned due to the high cost. Traffic flow =Route 42= Southbound traffic on Route 42 enters the intersection along McMillan Avenue, a one-way westbound street which begins at the northeast corner of the rhomboid, taking southbound traffic from Donald Street. At the intersection with Route 62, the main traffic lanes lead onto Pembina Highway southbound; however, traffic in the rightmost lane can also switch onto a short cul-de-sac segment of McMillan Avenue. Northbound traffic on Route 42 must filter into one of three lanes. The leftmost lane, which is separated from the other two by a median strip, instead merges with an eastbound lane coming from Corydon Avenue. Traffic in this lane may head straight through the intersection onto Donald or may turn north onto Osborne; traffic in the other two lanes may head straight through the intersection or turn south onto Osborne. The triangle created by the separation of Pembina Highway's northbound and southbound lanes at Osborne is also bisected by a dedicated lane reserved for Winnipeg Transit buses. The rightmost lane of Osborne along the side of the triangle is also reserved for buses; in 2007, the city of Winnipeg repaved the bus-only lanes in a different colour of pavement than the rest of the roadway. =Route 62= Southbound traffic on Osborne Street must use the McMillan/Pembina intersection to turn west onto Corydon Avenue or south onto Pembina Highway, and the Donald/Pembina intersection to turn east onto Donald Street. Northbound traffic on Osborne must turn right onto Donald to access any of the cross streets, and drivers seeking to head west on Corydon or south on Pembina must then loop back along McMillan. Northbound cars cannot turn directly onto Pembina at the McMillan/Pembina intersection. Drivers approaching the intersection from this direction see the intersection's most iconic traffic sign. =Route 95= Corydon Avenue arch Westbound traffic entering Corydon Avenue from any direction must use the McMillan/Pembina intersection, inclusive of the Donald/McMillan loop if necessary, and then turn onto Corydon. Eastbound traffic coming off Corydon may travel southbound onto Pembina, north onto Osborne or through the intersection. However, due to the median separating Pembina's northbound turning lane from its other lanes, this traffic cannot access the lanes which are permitted to turn southbound onto Osborne; a driver who wishes to make this turn must either take the Donald/McMillan loop or turn southbound onto Pembina and take a Michigan left via Jessie Street to return to Pembina's other set of northbound lanes. Neighbourhood The larger neighbourhood surrounding the intersection is officially called Little Italy, although the Confusion Corner nickname may also be extended to it. A restaurant located on Corydon Avenue, on the southwest corner of the junction, is named the Confusion Corner Bar & Grill. Popular culture The intersection is referenced in The Weakerthans' song \\"Civil Twilight\\", from their 2007 album Reunion Tour. The song is written from the perspective of a Winnipeg Transit driver. The television series Less Than Kind, set in Winnipeg, based its title logo on the sign approaching the intersection northbound along Osborne Street.

Mishra served as the General Secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation between 1975 and 1998. Early life and student activism Vinod Mishra was born to Suryakesh Mishra in Jabalpur. The family moved to Kanpur in 1955. Mishra studied at Adarsh Banga Vidyalaya Inter College. Later he graduated from Kanyakubja Degree College and was admitted at the Christ Church Degree College for post-graduate studies in Mathematics. He went on to study at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at the Regional Engineering College in Durgapur in 1966. Mishra became associated with a group of leftwing students, who soon developed linkages to the AICCCR. Mishra led student rallies and a campus strike. By mid-1969 he had become a professional revolutionary. Mishra became the secretary of the Durgapur Local Organising Committee of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) (formed out of the AICCCR) in the early 1970s. However, he was arrested (along with Mahadev Mukherjee). After having pass a period at Asansol hospital following brutal beatings by the police, he was sent to the Baharampur Central Jail. Mishra continued to conduct political activities inside the prison. 1972‚Äì1975 He was unconditionally released from prison on 20 June 1972 as one year without trial had passed. However, his release arose suspicion in the CPI(ML). He was deployed to a remote village in the Agradwip area of Burdwan district. Along with Kartick Pal, he organized a peasants movement in the district. At the same time, chaos reigned in the CPI(ML). Mishra and Pal were included in the Burdwan Regional Committee of the party. In 1973 the CPI(ML) was split, with one group led by Sharma and another by Mahadev Mukherjee. Mishra initially belonged to Mukherjee's party, but he and the Burdwan Regional Committee broke with Mukherjee in September 1973. Mishra sought contact with the Sharma group, but the Burdwan Regional Committee was later divided and Mishra denounced the political line of Sharma (a critique, which amongst other things, called for the formation of open mass organizations, a move that almost constituted a heresy in the CPI(ML) movement at the time). In 1974 Mishra came into contact with Subrata Dutta (Jauhar), a leader of armed struggle in the plain areas of Bihar. On 28 July 1974 (the second death anniversary of Charu Majumdar) a new party Central Committee was formed with Jauhar as General Secretary and Mishra and Swadesh Bhattacharya (Raghu) as members. The reorganized party became known as the 'anti-Lin Biao' group (whilst the faction of Mahadev Mukherjee constituted the 'pro-Lin Biao' group). The party would also become known as the CPI(ML) Liberation.Frontline. The road from Naxalbari . Volume 22 - Issue 21, 8‚Äì21 October 2005 Party leader Mishra served as West Bengal secretary of the new party organization. Under Mishra's leadership new dalams (guerilla squads) were formed. In November 1975 Jauhar was killed. Mishra became the new party General Secretary in a reorganized five-member Central Committee. Mishra organized a second party congress, held clandestinely in the rural areas of Gaya district in February 1976. The congress unanimously re-elected Mishra as General Secretary. On 1‚Äì2 January 1979 Mishra was encircled by police forces at Badpathujote in the Phansidewa area of Darjeeling district. In the midst of a prolonged gun-battle, Mishra sustained multiple injuries and his comrade Bakul Sen (alias Amal) was killed. Mishra was able to escape, assisted by the dalam commander Nemu Singh. Mishra secretly visited China in 1979. After the 11 July 1996 massacre in Bathani Tola, in which 21 Dalits were killed by Ranvir Sena, Mishra declared an 'eye for an eye' policy of vengeance against the perpetrators of the massacre.Hindustan Times. Formation of private armies Mishra was re-elected General Secretary of the party at the sixth congress of CPI(ML) Liberation in Varanasi in October 1997. Political legacy Mishra was the political architect of the process of re-orientation of CPI(ML) Liberation. By 1976 the party had adopted a position that armed struggle would be combined with building a broad anti-Congress democratic front movement. The process further elaborated through an internal rectification process initiated in late 1977. In the early 1980s CPI(ML)Liberation began building an open non- party mass movement (in direct contradiction to the original policy of CPI(ML)), the Indian People's Front (founded in April 1982). The construction of IPF, through which the underground party could develop links to other democratic forces on the basis of a popular, democratic and patriotic programme, was based on interventions by Mishra. After the fifth party congress of CPI(ML)Liberation, Mishra left his underground life. He made his first public appearance in 25 years at a rally on the Parade Grounds of Calcutta in December 1992. However although Mishra broke with the dogmas of the early CPI(ML), he never renounced Charu Majumdar's legacy.Karat, Prakash. Naxalism Today; At an Ideological Deadend.

After the election, the composition of the council was *Conservative 22 *Liberal Democrat 9 Campaign Before the election there were 18 Conservative and 12 Liberal Democrat councillors, with 15 of the 31 seats being contested. One of the 15 seats, in Fareham South ward, was vacant after an independent, former Liberal Democrat, councillor had stepped down, after being fined for false housing and council tax benefit claims. Fareham South was among a number of wards which were reported as being vulnerable to a change in party control including Fareham East, Fareham North, Portchester West, Stubbington and Titchfield Common. A couple of former councillors who had been defeated in the 2002 election stood again, former Labour group leader Mick Prior in Fareham North-West and Conservative Nick Walker in Portchester West. Issues in the election included council tax levels and plans by the government to build 1,000 houses near Sarisbury. The national issue of the Iraq War was also seen as being likely to sway votes in the election. Election result The results saw the Conservatives increase their majority on the council after gaining 3 seats from the Liberal Democrats. Conservative gains included Stubbington where they won by only 8 votes over the Liberal Democrats after a recount and in Portchester West where Nick Walker returned to the council. The Conservatives also gained a seat in Fareham South from an independent in a seat which had previously been seen as strongly Liberal Democrat. The Liberal Democrats partly blamed their defeats on the election being held at the same time as the European elections, while a defeated Labour candidate said their failure to win any seats was in line with the national performance by the party.

The primary deity of the temple is Shri Rajarajeshwari. The temple was constructed in the 8th century AD by King Suratha and has been developed by many dynasties which ruled over the region. The idol of Shri Rajarajeshwari is completely moulded from clay with special medicinal properties. The temple portrays Hindu architecture with roofs adorned with wooden carvings of gods and copper plates. Daily and special poojas are conducted in the temple under the auspices of the head priest madhava bhat. Annual festivals are held in the temple with much fanfare. Polali Chendu festival is an important festive event where football is played to represent the fight of good over evil. The Chendu festival is followed by the annual festival in March, which lasts for a month and is attended by people from all over the world. Location The temple is located in Polali on the banks of the river Phalguni in Kariyangala village of Bantwal taluk, Dakshina Kannada, Karnataka. The temple is surrounded by lush paddy fields. The Phalguni river flows on the northern side of the temple. The nearest city from the temple is Mangalore at 19 km away.< near to kaikamba 4 to 5 km across >; Etymology The place where the temple was located was known as Pural in ancient times. The word Pural means Flute in Tulu language. The origin of the word Pural is the Mugera language. The word Pural or Purel also has the meaning of changing sides, which may also apply in this case as the river takes an abrubt turn near the temple. In Sanskrit, it was referred to as Paliapura, which later came to be known as Polali in Kannada. In several ancient epigraphs and records, the main deity of the temple was referred to as Porala Devi. its one of the power full god in dakshina Kannada .... History Temple car festival The temple has been referred to in many ancient inscriptions, including the Markandeya Purana, Ashoka inscriptions and travel accounts of ancient travellers. According to an inscription discovered in the vicinity of the temple, the temple around the clay idol was built in 8th century AD. It is a widely held belief that the temple was built by King Suratha, and that the king offered his own crown, studded with precious jewels, to be placed on the head of the deity. The king, having lost most of his kingdom in a war and being betrayed by his own ministers, is believed to have taken refuge under a sage named Sumedha in forests located around what is the location of the temple now. The clay idol of the main deity in the temple is historically believed to be up to 5000 years old. The king is reported to have carved the clay idol of Shri Rajarajeshwari himself and offered penance to the deity in return for his kingdom. Many ancient inscriptions alluding to the temple were reported around the temple, but were lost over time primarily due to the neglect of their keepers. The remaining inscriptions, which are available today were obtained in kariyangala village, Ammunje and in the temple itself and is now under custody of the Karnataka Government. The region surrounding the temple were ruled by many dynasties including Kadamba, Chalukya, Alupa, Rashtrakoota, Hoisala, Vijayanagara, Ikkeri, Mysore etc. Most of these dynasties spent a lot of resources on this temple and donated agricultural lands for the benefit of the temple. Kings from the Alupa dynasty, which ruled the region around 710 AD to 720 AD were particularly noted to have contributed to the development of the temple and to have encouraged the worship of Shri Rajarajeshwari in the region. In later years, Queen Chennammaji of Keladi is reported to have visited the temple and gifted the temple with a grand chariot. Architecture Temple bali Records written by Abdul Razzak in 1448 suggest that the temple was initially built from molten brass. He recorded that the temple had four platforms. An image of the deity, 5 to 6 feet in height, with red rubies for eyes were present on the highest of the platforms. Today, the idol of the main deity, Shri Rajarajeshwari is a stucco image of the deity with a height of 10 feet. The clay used for making the idol was specially prepared with herbal mixtures for added strength. The temple also has smaller idols for other deities including Subramanya, Bhadhrakali, Mahaganapathi and Saraswathi. During a relogious event named Lepashta Gandha, the idols are coated with a special soil mixture with eight medicinal properties once every 12 years. The soil used for coating was prepared hundreds of years ago and not prepared freshly on each occasion. The roof of Mukhamantapa, a section of the temple has many Gods and Goddesses exquisitely carved in wood.

The football, which is a leather ball, is made by a cobbler family in Mijar. An oil miller family from Kadapu Karia is given the responsibility of bringing the ball from the cobbler family, wherein they announce the date of the commencement of the game after they place the ball in the freshly cleaned frontyard of Malali Ballal. On the evening of the first day of the family, the cobbler family place the ball and a palm leaf umbrella on the gopuram of the temple. After offering prayers to the deity, the ball is taken to the football field and the game is commenced. Up to five hundred people compete in the games, though any number of people may compete. The objective of the game is to get the ball to the opposition's side. The game historically represents the fight of good over evil and the car festival at the end of the games are said to represent the victory of the good over the evil. Annual festival Temple car during festival An annual festival is celebrated at the temple during the month of March.The festival lasts for one month.

Levy is a Professor of Epidemiology (Social and Behavioral Sciences) at Yale School of Public Health and Professor of Psychology at Yale University. She is a leading researcher in the fields of social gerontology and psychology of aging. She has conducted foundational research on how self- stereotypes operate and how older individuals are influenced by and can influence their societies. Career Levy was born in Atlanta, GA. She studied psychology and Near Eastern studies at the University of Michigan. She received her MA and PhD in Psychology from Harvard University. She trained as a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Medical School in the Division on aging and Department of Social Medicine. Afterward, she started teaching as an assistant professor at Yale School of Public Health. Levy's primary research interests lie in examining the psycho-social influences of aging on individual health and well-being. In particular, her work has focused on elucidating the mechanisms by which self perceptions of aging and age stereotypes impact both cognitive and physical health. In a series of studies, Levy established causal links between age stereotypes held by individuals and a number of outcomes previously unknown to be affected by such stereotypes, including memory, cardiac reactivity to stress, and longevity.Levy, B. (1996). Improving memory in old age by implicit self-stereotyping. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 71, 1092-1107.Levy, B., Hausdorff, J., Hencke, R., & Wei, J. Y. (2000).

Increased longevity by positive self- perceptions of aging. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 83, 261-270. Subsequently, this body of research has come to form the basis for her stereotype embodiment theory (SET).Levy, B. (2009). Stereotype embodiment: A psychological approach to aging. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 18, 332-336. Levy has contributed over 90 articles and chapters to psychological, gerontological, and medical journals and books. Her research on health and ageing has been featured on the front page of The New York Times, and she was invited by the U.S. Senate to give testimony before the Special Committee on Aging regarding the harmful impact of ageism in popular media and marketing.

Agricultural astrology is often referred to as \\"planting by the signs\\" because of its reliance on astrological signs for planting, cultivating and harvesting.Lewis 2003, p. 11-12 The Old Farmer's Almanac regularly features a \\"planting by the signs\\" section. Lewis 2003, p. 13 History Agricultural astrology is one of the oldest forms of astrology. It was probably the first use humans made of lunar cycles.Oken 2006, p. 16 Evidence of its practice dates back thousands of years to the ancient peoples of the Nile and Euphrates River valleys. Farmers of these civilizations planted by the Moon's phase and its sign in the zodiac.Llewellyn 2004, p. 83 There is a lack of scientific evidence proving the beneficial effects of astrological gardening. A few studies have been conducted, but \\"none of this has been conclusively proven or disproved by modern science\\". Other uses Although agricultural astrology is primarily used as a guide for growing crops, it also has been applied to the practice of animal husbandry. For example, agricultural astrology encourages poultry farmers to set up their chicken's eggs to hatch when it is a new moon and in a \\"fruitful\\" sign. It claims that chicks hatched during this time grow faster and produce more offspring.Llewellyn 2004, p. 91 Moon gardeners maintain that not only is science on their side, but also that the results are plain to see. According to the theory, plants that are sown in the few days before a full moon become stronger and more productive. The moon gardeners claim that the gravitational force of the full moon affects the level of groundwater in the soil, just as it does the level of the oceans. The phases of the moon do not correspond to the distance of the moon's orbit around the Earth, and hence are not indicators of the strength of the moon's gravitational pull. Instead, apogee and perigee of the moon's orbit are what determines the moon's distance to the Earth. Also, the increase in moonlight between the new moon and full moon (waxing phase) are thought to stimulate leaf growth,Planting by the Moon  Tipsplants.com when the light decreases between the full moon and new moon (waning phase) the plant's energy is then thought to be focused on the roots.Waxing-Waning Moon  Astrocal.co.uk Each astrological sign has its own corresponding element (earth, air, fire, water) and the most favorable times for planting above ground leafy crops is said to be when the Moon is in the leaf/water signs (Cancer, Pisces, Scorpio) and the underground root crops when the Moon is in the root/earth signs (Capricorn, Taurus, Virgo).Best Planting Days: the Influence of the Astrological Moon Signs  gardeningbythemoon.com One of the more notable sources to rely upon this methodology is the annual Farmers' Almanac, which bases its Gardening by the Moon Calendar on the concept of agricultural astrology.

It is bounded by the Interstate 579 (Crosstown Boulevard) on the west, Centre Avenue on the north, Washington Place on the east, and Fifth Avenue to the south. Comprising a 2,200 car parking garage, Marriott Hotel, luxury condominium building, and office and retail space, Chatham Center is a major destination center with PPG Paints Arena and Duquesne University nearby. History Chatham Center was named after the Earl of Chatham, William Pitt, for whom Pittsburgh is named. Groundbreaking for the project occurred with much fireworks and fanfare the evening of October 20, 1964. The complex was built between 1964 - 1966 by Chatham Center Inc, of which the principal investors were Morton S. Wolf and Leon Falk Jr.Vince Johnson, \\"Fireworks and Fanfare Hail Chatham Center\\", Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, October 21, 1964 Financing for construction was provided by the Irving Trust Company of New York and the Mellon National Bank of Pittsburgh with the mortgage for the center being held by the Prudential Insurance Company. The architects for the project were William Lescaze and Harry H. Lefkowitz while the construction was by the Diesel Construction Company of Pittsburgh. Prior to construction, four downtown Pittsburgh hotels waged an unsuccessful two-year court battle that was appealed all the way to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court opposing the construction on the grounds that there were already too many hotel rooms in downtown Pittsburgh and further hotel construction would hinder current hotel business in the city.Vince Johnson, \\"Hill to Get Five-Acre City-In-City\\", Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, September 29, 1964 =Original plans= The original plans for the center called for a 20 floor luxury apartment building; nine-story office building with a hotel above; a 650-seat movie theater; a 2,200 car garage and gas station at a cost of $26 million. The building plans were delayed by labor strikes and absent building materials, but was finally completed by 1966. The day-long dedication and open house occurred on September 7, 1966 with a ceremonial \\"light-switch\\" thrown by Richard K. Mellon.\\"Dedication at Chatham\\", Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, September 8, 1966 =Multiple owners= Chatham Center Inc continued to operate the center until 1975 when Prudential was able to foreclose on the mortgage and bought the entire Chatham Center facility at sheriff's sale for $19 million.

Elteq Management Company assumed management of the center and renovated the parking garage shortly after the sale. In 2014, One Chatham Center went into foreclosure after UPMC's departure left the space nearly vacant. In 2015, HSBC Bank USA bought One Chatham Center at a sheriff's sale for $2,321.

Most of it can be dated to the 1st century AD. The trove consists of about seventy exquisitely crafted solid silver vessels for eating and drinking and is now kept in the Antikensammlung Berlin (Altes Museum). It is generally believed that the treasure was the table service of a Roman commander, perhaps Publius Quinctilius Varus, who was militarily active in Germania. However, others also suggest that the treasure may have been war spoils rather than a table service. The hoard was buried about 2 meters below the ground on Galgenberg Hill, and was found by Prussian soldiers when preparing part of the area for a shooting range. Most scholars now accept that the entire Hildesheim Treasure was produced in frontier workshops of the northwestern Roman provinces. Notable items The trove contains plates, tureens, cups, goblets, trays, scoops, egg-holders, saltcellars, a small folding three-legged table, a candelabrum and a three- legged pedestal. One of the finest items is the so-called Minerva Bowl (or Athena Bowl). It features a detailed image of Minerva, who sits on a rock throne and holds a cane in her right hand and a shield in the left hand. The goddess is wearing her battle headgear and flowing robe, further from Minerva's right hand is her symbol, the owl. The bowl has two handles, each measuring 3.4 cm in length. The bowl itself weighs 2.388 kg, having 25 cm in diameter and 7.1 cm in depth. The krater was lost during 1945, and now shown in plaster copy. Other notable items are paterae with the high relief of infant Hercules strangling the serpents and with the low relief heads of Attis and Cybele. There are also three calyx bowls with heavy rims, a tripod bowl with a leaf ornament performed in niello, a krater and a kantharos, as well as two-handled cups ornamented in repouss√© and items dedicated to Bacchus.

Little is known of her life outside the music industry. She is known to have recorded just twenty-four tracks, seven of which were alternate takes. Her songs include \\"Penitentiary\\" and \\"Fryin' Pan Skillet Blues\\". Biography Tucker hailed from East Texas. References in her songs led the researcher Max Haymes to speculate that she may have been based in Greenville. The researchers Bob Eagle and Eric LeBlanc state, on the basis of her death certificate, that she was born in Rusk, Cherokee County, Texas, the daughter of Georgia ( Connor) and John Chris Tucker. She had a light complexion and a small frame but was said to be \\"a strong singer with a dark voice\\". In August 1928, she recorded a number of songs, most of which she wrote, for the Victor label in Memphis, Tennessee. She was accompanied on piano by the Dallas-born K. D. Johnson. This recording session yielded her best-known song, \\"Penitentiary\\". The subject of the song was reputedly not unknown to Tucker. A second session in Dallas followed in October 1929, at which she was again accompanied by Johnson and by the guitarist Jesse Thomas. After this, nothing more is known of her life. Only one photograph of Tucker is known.The only known photograph of Tucker Last.fm Retrieved November 19, 2010. She died in Dallas in early 1933, aged 27 at most, based on her age given in the 1910 and 1920 censuses, though her death certificate gave her birth year as 1907 and her age as 25. In 1960, the Dallas pianist Whistlin' Alex Moore told an interviewer that Tucker and Ida May Mack, who had shared the 1928 recording session with Tucker, were both \\"tough cookies ... don't mess with them\\". However, in a 1972 conversation, the pianist was unable to recall the name of either singer, leading the interviewer to suspect that he had drawn his own conclusions from their recordings. Music buffs can only affirm that Tucker sang in the same style as the Texas singers Texas Alexander, Victoria Spivey and Texas Bill Day and that her lyrics refer to railroads that served East Texas and Dallas. Some of Tucker's tracks and those of Mack are available on a compilation album. All of her recordings have been issued by Document Records (see below).

She was scrapped as the Big Red at Alang, India in June 2005. History Eugenio C at sea. Eugenio C was ordered for the South American service by Costa (Linea C), to replace the Frederico C on that route. Her keel was laid on 4 January 1964, with Eugenio C being delivered to Costa on 22 August 1966, the same day she set out on her maiden trans-Atlantic voyage. For 10 years she only operated trans-Atlantic voyages between Genoa and South America, until passenger loading dropped rapidly in the 1970s, when the Eugenio C began cruising. After 1983 she would cross the Atlantic Ocean twice a year on a repositioning voyage. In 1984 she was extensively renovated and renamed the Eugenio Costa. It was planned the vessel would be renamed American Adventure and transferred to American Family Cruises, which was to be a branch of Costa, but this plan was never realized. Eugenio Costa completed her last cruise for her original owners in November 1996. Costa sold the Eugenio Costa to the Bremer Vulcan shipyards in part exchange for the construction of the Costa Victoria. Lowline Shipping would go on to acquire her and well charter her to Direct Cruises, a British cruise line which offered budget cruises marketed via telemarketing. $12 million USD was spent on refitting the Eugenio Costa into the Edinburgh Castle. The vessel's mechanical problems brought about great difficulty to Direct and Lowline, until Direct filed for liquidation and Lowline Shipping filed for bankruptcy in 1999. Ownership of Edinburgh Castle was passed on to Lowline's main creditor, shipbuilder Cammell Laird. Eugenio C as The Big Red Boat II. Cammell Laird chartered the vessel to Premier Cruises, renaming her The Big Red Boat II and having her go under a 10-month $25 million USD overhaul. Premier went into liquidation in September 2000, as a result Cammell Laird briefly chartered her to the United States Government, after which time she was laid up at Freeport, Bahamas alongside fellow ex-Premier fleet mates Rembrandt and Big Red Boat III. =Demise= The Big Red Boat II was sold to Argo Ship Management, who kept her up on the market. By 2005 it was obvious cruise companies were not willing to take their chances with her due to her history of mechanical problems. The vessel was renamed Red Boat, stopping in the Azores to refuel before being broken up for scrap at Alang scrapyards. Pop Culture The Eugenio C has a very brief but close-up appearance in the Brazilian movie Roberto Carlos em Ritmo de Aventura (1968), as Roberto buzzes the ship with his helicopter (a Hughes 269) near Rio de Janeiro.

The band briefly reunited in 1986, with Cataldo, Wilkinson, Hebditch, and Paley. They recorded a six-song EP, Hot Steel and Acid, for the French-based New Rose label; it was subsequently issued as well by Boston's Ace of Hearts Records.

It marked the return to democracy after the Bouterse military dictatorship of the 1980s. History After the Batavian Republic took over the Colony of Suriname from the Society of Suriname in 1795, the Dutch government issued various government regulations for Suriname (Dutch: Regeringsreglement voor Suriname), establishing the government of the colony. In 1865, a new government regulation replaced the previous regulation of 1832, which theoretically gave Suriname some limited self-rule. The colonial elite was given the right to elect a Colonial Council (Dutch: Koloniale Raad) which would co-govern the colony together with the Governor-General appointed by the Dutch crown. Among others, the Colonial Council was allowed to decide over the colony's budget, which was subject to approval by the Dutch crown, but which did not see any involvement of Dutch parliament. In the wake of the 1922 Dutch constitutional revision, in which the term \\"colony\\" was replaced by the term \\"overseas territory\\", the 1865 government regulation was replaced by the Basic Law of Suriname () on 1 April 1937. This Basic Law renamed the Colonial Council to Estates of Suriname () and increased the membership from 13 to 15. After the Second World War, during which the Dutch government-in-exile had pledged to review the relationship between the Netherlands and its colonies, the Basic Law was extensively revised. In March 1948, revisions to the Basic Law were adopted by Dutch parliament, which introduced universal suffrage for both men and women, which increased the membership of the Estates from 15 to 21, and which introduced a College of General Government () which was to assist the Governor in the everyday government of the colony, and which was the precursor to the Cabinet of Ministers. The new constitution took effect in July 1948. After the Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands was proclaimed on 15 December 1954, Suriname ceased to be an overseas possession of the Netherlands, and rather became a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, in which the Netherlands Antilles, Suriname and the Netherlands itself cooperated on a basis of equality. A new Basic Law that reflected the new constitutional arrangements was adopted by the Estates of Suriname in 1955. The first constitution of independent Suriname was adopted in 1975, and was modeled after the Constitution of the Netherlands. It was suspended after the 1980 Surinamese coup d'√©tat and was replaced by the current constitution after being approved in a referendum held on 30 September 1987.

The returning monks refused to accept the validity of Thaton-Buddhism ordination. The quarrel became a schism: those who derived their ordination from Shin Arahan were known as the Former Order; those who derived it from Ceylon were known as the Latter Order. The king supported the new movement. More and more monks were sent to Ceylon where they received ordination at the ancient Mahavihara Monastery. Shin Uttarajiva died in October 1191 (right around the end of Buddhist Lent). By then, the Mahavihara school became the predominant school of Burmese Buddhism. Shin Chapata also returned from Ceylon right after his teacher's death, and carried on his teacher's reformation effort. But the old order did not yield easily. The schism lasted two centuries before Conjeveram Buddhism finally died out. Shin Uttarajiva was succeeded by Shin Siha Maha Upali as primate.

Early life Francesco Cirofici was born in 1887 in Italy. He worked as a steam fitter as well as being a member of the Lenox Avenue Gang. Before his arrest in connection with the Rosenthal killing, he had been arrested only once. In 1905, he was imprisoned on a burglary charge in the Elmira Correctional Facility.

It was rumored that Cirofici had been betrayed to the police by the owner of the Dante Caf√©, James Verrella. Verrella was murdered on July 30, 1912 in retaliation for his supposed betrayal.

The National Race Congress selected Jernagin to attend the Paris Peace Conference and the First Pan-African Congress in 1919. Early life William Henry Jernagin was born in Mashulaville, Mississippi, on October 13, 1869, to Allen Fletcher Jernagin and Julia Ruth Walker.Jones, p. 21 While his parents were mostly illiterate, they managed to obtain a small 40-acre farm upon which they grew a variety of fruits and vegetables. His family worked primarily harvesting apples and peaches for Juke Jernagin, a former slave owner. In the breaks between the sowing and reaping seasons, William attended a number of public schools in the Noxubee and Lauderdale Counties, among them Meridian Academy, Alcorn A&M; College, and Jackson College.Jones, p. 20. In addition, he attended American Correspondence School located in Danville, N.Y.Jones, p. 156. First steps After working in a school in Lauderdale County for roughly five years, Jernagin was licensed to preach by the Bush Fork Baptist Church of Mississippi. In 1892, two years after his pastoral licensing, the 23-year-old Jernagin was called to preach at a number of Mississippi Baptist Churches including: New Prospect Baptist Church in Meridian, Mississippi, Mount Moriah Baptist Church, and Scooba Baptist Church in Okolona, Mississippi. The year of 1896 was a busy one for Jernagin, who worked to unite a number of churches, among them: Missionary Union Baptist Church, First Baptist Church in Winona, Mississippi, Second Baptist Church, First Baptist Church in Mound Bayou, Mississippi, First Baptist Church in Brandon, Mississippi, and Tabernacle Baptist Church in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.Jones, pp. 156‚Äì157. During this year, he founded Mississippi's Meridian Baptist Seminary, which was among the first educational institutions for African Americans east of the Mississippi River and helped establish an educational standard for African-American Baptist pastors. In addition, he became the president of the Oklahoma General Baptist Convention, aided in the establishment of the Winona-Granada Baptist College, and organized the Young People's Christian Educational Congress of Mississippi. In 1905, following his rapid string of accomplishments for the church and well-received pastorates all across the state of Mississippi, Jernagin was appointed to the Tabernacle Baptist Church, which led him to move to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. An article run by the Oklahoma Safeguard on July 6, 1905, stated of the young pastor: \\"The installation of Reverend W.H. Jernagin as pastor of the Tabernacle Baptist Church, of Oklahoma City was pulled off last Sunday in good shape. Rev. Jernagin, seated away back in that fine church, confronted with an audience of from five hundred to eight hundred, surrounded by all the big preachers, lawyers, doctors, teachers and big men of that great city, looked as though he was old Pope Leo.\\" He served as Tabernacle's pastor for nine years and used his position in the community and personal influence within the National Baptist Convention (NBC) to engage a number of statewide and nationwide problems relating to Jim Crow policies. With the aid of others, Jernagin formed the State Constitutional League of Oklahoma whose expressed goal was to \\"secure the manhood rights of the race [sic] in concert with rights anticipated by other Americans\\". Jernagin himself testified in court advocating against the admission of the Oklahoma territory and Indian territory into the United States, decrying the idea as a move that would further entrench Jim Crow laws.Jones, p. 36. William Harrison, a local attorney based out of Oklahoma City, aided the State Constitutional League in bringing a suit before the United States Supreme Court. A key feature of the case involved the Interstate Passenger Law. \\"Harrison knew [that the] success [of the case] would put an end to all 'Jim Crowism' as far as interstate passengers were concerned.\\"Jones, p. 37. Move to Washington, D.C. In 1912, Reverend Jernagin was appointed to serve in Washington, D.C., at the Mount Carmel Baptist Church. While this move marked the end of his residence in the state of Oklahoma, his influence in the state's affairs certainly never abated. On November 16, 1912, The Washington Bee, a prominent African-American weekly newspaper based in Washington, D.C., said of his installation and ensuing pastorate: \\"[Jernagin] is a wide-awake man. He is an eloquent and logical speaker, and his people think the world of him. [ ... ] there has never been a man at this church who has ever been more honored and respected than [Jernagin] ... it is quite evident ... that his administration will be a success\\".Jones, p. 41. He would go on to serve the Mount Carmel congregation and the broader D.C. community with distinction for an illustrious 46-year term until his death in 1958. During his first few years of serving in the nation's capital, Jernagin's position and clout within the National Baptist Convention continued to increase. Additionally, his influence in the surrounding communities steadily rose as he expanded his social networks to include key individuals, most notably: The Washington Bee publisher William Calvin Chase, activist and newspaper editor William Monroe Trotter, fellow Baptist, Reverend Walter Henderson Brooks, educator and founder of the National Training School for Women and Girls Nannie Helen Burroughs, and clubwoman Mary Church Terrell. These individuals supported Jernagin, effectively and efficiently \\"incorporating him into the organizations and issues that advocated for civil and human rights\\", while also providing him a myriad of sociopolitical avenues to approach the racial and religious issues he sought to engage with.Jones, p. 45. Attending the Pan-African Congress (1919, 1921) During the years following the close of the First World War, Jernagin's voice and influence rose as his positions within such organizations as the National Baptist Convention and the National Race Conference invited significant crossover between his promotion of Christian ideals and his fight for black rights around the globe. As the president of the National Race Conference (NRC), which later consolidated with National Equal Rights League (of which William Monroe Trotter was closely associated, Jernagin traveled to Europe to attend the Pan-African Congress (PAC) to serve as a delegate for the NRC.Jones, p. 65. While he missed the first day of the meeting, he was present for the business session and bore witness to the nine-point resolution that was released on March 29, 1919, which read: \\"The Negroes of the world in [PAC] assembled demand for the interests of justice and humanity and for strengthening the forces of civilization that immediate steps be taken to develop the 200,000,000 of Negroes and Negroids. To this end we propose: That the allied and associated powers establish a code of laws similar to the proposed international code of labor. The League of Nations establish a permanent bureau, charged with the special duty of overseeing the application of these laws to the political, social and economic welfare of the natives. The Negroes of the world demand that hereafter the natives of Africa and the peoples of Africa [sic] descent be governed according to the following principles: [land, capital, labor, education, medicine/ hygiene, the state, culture/religion, civilized Negroes and the League of Nations].\\"Jones, pp. 73‚Äì74. In addition to attending the PAC, Jernagin also used his time in Paris, France, to visit some black troops stationed there. In an article published in the Kansas City Advocate on May 2, 1919, he reported on the dismal treatment some of the servicemen had received, stating: \\"The Negro, especially of the labor battalions, had not received a square deal in France, and white officers had carried their race prejudice into France, and had not failed to exhibit it when the occasion presented itself. But I thank God I am able to say to you that in the face of all this our boys discharged their duty and are war heroes. Some of them died, and at the command marched into death like they were going into a banquet hall. The world will give them credit of being soldiers. We must do it ourselves, and not depend on others.\\" Jernagin later attended the Pan-African Congress of 1921, held in London, England. In 1920, following the Paris Peace Conference Jernagin and the NRC welcomed the President-elect C. D. B. King of Liberia. Following the introduction and entertainment of the President-elect, the NRC pledged its support to the Liberian people, considering it a \\"Sister Republic\\" and \\"the open door through which the New World might entertain life in Africa.\\"Jones, p. 75. His involvement with the PAC and the subsequent international relationships forged as a result illustrates Jernagin's steadfast dedication to the ending of \\"colonial rule, racial discrimination and imperialism in Africa and the Caribbean, while also demanding basic human rights and equality of economic opportunity.\\"Jones, p. 9. Involvement with the National Fraternal Council of Negro Churches The National Fraternal Council of Negro Churches (NFCNC) was formed in 1933 after Bishop Reverdy C. Ransom (of the African Methodist Episcopal Church) issued an appeal to black ministers to meet and discuss possibly forming an organization that would serve as an African-American- oriented Federal Council of Churches. The first meeting of the NFCNC was held at Mount Carmel Church. Of the organization's formation, Ransom stated: \\"Impelled by a deep sense of the need of our racial group for an authoritative voice to speak for us on social, economic, industrial and political questions and believing that a united Negro church could best supply this need, a number of interested churchmen met in Washington and bound themselves together in what they designated as a Voluntary Committee on the Federation of Negro Religious Denominations in the United States of America.\\"Sawyer, p. 52. Jernagin served as the NFCNC's president from 1938 to 1939, as the Council's chair from 1940 to1945 and later from 1952 to 1958. In addition, he created the Washington Bureau Committee, a branch of the NFCNC that he later separated from the parent organization. Jernagin would resign from his position at the Washington Bureau as a result of conflict, but regained his position as the chair of the NFCNC in 1952, a position he would hold until his death six years later.Jones, pp. 100‚Äì101. \\"With both the Washington Bureau and the executive committee under his command, Jernagin in effect was the NFCNC\\"Sawyer, p. 59. Jernagin's Washington Bureau \\"met and corresponded with presidents Roosevelt to [Eisenhower]; testified before House and Senate Committees on such issues as the FEPC, anti-lynching and anti‚Äìpoll tax bills, desegregation of interstate travel, housing and education aid, civil rights for [Washington] and the 1957 Civil Rights Act.\\"Sawyer, p. 61. Jernagin's Washington Bureau \\"served as the de facto voice of the black church on executive and legislative matters in the struggle to secure civil rights.\\"Jones, p. 89. Death and legacy Reverend William Jernagin died on February 18, 1958, while on vacation in Miami, Florida.Jones, p. 152. Following his death, the Baltimore Afro-American reported: \\"A positive leader [is] one who takes a firm stand and does not equivocate. For years [Jernagin] has been recognized as the 'watchdog of the race' at the Nation's capital, both as a race leader and a denominational leader.\\" A number of prominent figures from a variety of backgrounds published statements regarding Jernagin's life and legacy, most notable among them: Martin Luther King Jr., Mordecai Johnson, E. Pauline Myers, and Andrew Fowler.Jones, p. 154. King noted, \\"[Jernagin] has given to the Baptist youth of America a leadership which will long be recorded in the annals of history. He has inspired thousands of young men and women. I will always remember the encouragement that he has given me.\\" Myers recalled, \\"There was no vain gloriousness [sic] about him. The common people loved him for he was one of them himself.\\" Jernagin's legacy can be characterized as one where the intersection of faith and civil always brought about useful change and dialogue.

The police team attempt to get Christine Hill to talk while Dexter frames another man in order to get Arthur Mitchell, the Trinity Killer, all to himself. Plot As Angel interrogates Christine, Dexter begins to consider framing someone as a decoy to the police, giving him time to kill Arthur. Meanwhile, Arthur sees a news report on the return of the boy he abducted and realizes that Dexter has not told the police about him. He phones Dexter and asks what he wants; Dexter, improvising, tells him that he wants $50,000 in 24 hours or he will tell the police that Arthur is pedophile. Arthur takes out a phonebook and researches the various Kyle Butlers of Miami, telling Dexter that he will be in touch. Debra tries to get Quinn to see that Christine isn't who she told him she was. When Dexter leaves the station, Quinn reacts suspiciously, asking him where he's really going. Captain Matthews confronts LaGuerta and Batista with a video of the two kissing, proving they were lying in their affidavits; he tells them that they have committed perjury and will need to find new jobs. Dexter goes through possible victim files to decide which one he should frame for Arthur's murders. Meanwhile, Arthur breaks into a house and kills the homeowner, named Kyle Butler. Dexter arrives for an appointment with Rita for marriage counseling, but gets called to a crime scene as soon as he arrives. Rita then confesses that she and Elliot kissed. Dexter arrives at the scene and learns the victim is a Kyle Butler, causing him to realize that Arthur is after him. Meanwhile, Angel and Debra search Christine's apartment and find a collection of postcards from her father. Dexter goes to another Kyle Butler and renders him unconscious via injection in order to catch Arthur. However, as soon as Arthur arrives, he realizes that the occupant is not Dexter and leaves before Dexter can grab him. Angels shows Christine the postcards, causing her to ask for a lawyer. Quinn realizes that she was using him to get close to the case; Debra tells him not to beat himself up. Dexter arrives at the home of Stan Beaudry and finds that he has taken a trip to Jacksonville. Instead of driving there, he decides to return home and talk with Rita, forgiving her offhandedly for kissing Elliot; for her part, Rita is concerned that Dexter doesn't seem to care that she nearly cheated on him. Dexter is called into the station and Debra attempts to get Christine to talk. She tells Christine about her own issues with her father, Harry, but Christine reveals nothing. Dexter arrives at the station and acts as witness to LaGuerta and Batista's marriage. He rushes off soon afterwards to kill Stan Beaudry. After a phone call from Mitchell, he catches up with Beaudry and kills him rapidly and plants Arthur's DNA and a picture of Christine in his truck and goes back to his home and plants a hammer there. Dexter returns home and punches Elliot in the face for kissing Rita; she witnesses it and prepares some ice for his hand, telling him that she is glad that he cared. LaGuerta and Batista inform Matthews of their marriage, telling him that a perjury charge wouldn't stand up in court. Christine calls Mitchell to tell him that she's in trouble, and he angrily tells her to never call him again and that he was sorry she had ever been born. Meanwhile, the team finds all the evidence Dexter planted. Debra is informed that Christine wishes to talk to her and she and Quinn rush to Christine's apartment, believing that she wishes to confess. She tells Debra that she shot her and killed Lundy, and asks Debra to forgive her. When Deb refuses, Christine pulls a gun from under a cushion and commits suicide. After hearing a phone call from Mitchell, Dexter goes to the arcade game area to hunt for him, unaware that Mitchell is in fact following him back to the station. Mitchell infiltrates the station by stealing a visitor's badge and wanders around the station, looking at his work. Debra tells Dexter that she is afraid to erase Lundy's name from the board because then it will all be over. Debra wipes it off after some thought and Dexter goes to his office. To his horror, he sees Mitchell headed toward his office and goes to meet him. Mitchell looks at Dexter's ID badge and says \\"Hello... Dexter Morgan\\". Reception =Critical Reaction= The reception of the episode was generally positive. IGN gave the episode a \\"Great\\" rating of 8.8/10 and said of it that: \\"We all know that Lithgow's been amazing this season, but I wanted to once again call out Jennifer Carpenter's performance as well. She was given a strong storyline that truly fit with her character's manic energy and she's nailed every scene like a conquering hero. Her hesitance to erase Lundy's name from the case board at the end was great, and so was her realization that focusing on work didn't wind up filling the void in her life; that solving the case didn't bring her any closure. 'I knew finding his killer wouldn't bring him back,\\" Deb lamented. \\"But I thought it would bring something.' I'd also like to take the time to bring up Courtney Ford's Christine Hill. Let's face it. Ford is fairly flat as an actress, but her best work definitely came in these past two episodes when she had much more difficult scenes to work through. Who knew that she would wind up being worlds better during moments of heartache and anxiety than she would just saying rudimentary lines like 'My name is Christine and I'm a reporter'?\\" =Awards= \\"Hello, Dexter Morgan\\" was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy or Drama Series (One Hour).

As a Royal Air Force (RAF) Spitfire fighter ace, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross after scoring eight victories against enemy aircraft in the Battle of Britain. Early life Bartley was born in Dacca India, the son of Sir Charles Bartley, an Irish barrister who served as a judge in the Calcutta High Court. Bartley was educated at Stowe School, a boarding independent school for boys in the civil parish of Stowe, in Buckinghamshire. RAF career In 1938 Bartley learned to fly. He joined the Royal Air Force in 1939 on a short service commission, and was posted to No. 92 (East India) Squadron in November 1939 as it was forming in Tangmere, Sussex with the fighter version of the twin engine Bristol Blenheim. After the Blenheims were replaced by Spitfires, Bartley fought over Dunkirk during the fall of France and evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force. He flew with the Squadron through the Battle of Britain, and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) in October 1940. In March 1941 Bartley was posted as a flight commander to No. 74 Squadron RAF at Manston in Kent. In May 1941 he served as a flying instructor at No. 53 Operational Training Unit and No. 56 Operational Training Unit (OTU), before moving in July 1941 to Vickers-Supermarine as a production test pilot, and made a significant contribution to the further development of the Spitfire.

The six attacks killed at least 12 people and wounded at least 71. No one claimed responsibility for the attacks, but Iraq's national security adviser, Mowaffaq al-Rubaie, blamed the attacks on Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. The bombings marked the first major attack against the Christian community since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.  Attacks  File:Sayedat al-najat Church. The attacks happened within a few minutes of each another. The rigged cars were parked outside churches and detonated when parishioners were leaving services. Only one of the bombings is believed to have been a suicide attack. The witnesses reported that \\"body parts were scattered across the area\\". Of the six bombs, one did not explode and the police was able to remove it safely. In Mosul, hospitals reported two persons killed and 15 wounded. One of the bombed churches the Our Lady of Salvation Syriac Catholic cathedral was the same church that was attacked with hostages taken and killed on October 31, 2010.  Responsibility  Al-Qaeda in Iraq claimed responsibility for the attacks on an Islamic website. Iraq's national security adviser, Mowaffaq al-Rubaie, blamed the attacks on Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Reaction A Vatican spokesman, Rev. Ciro Benedettini, called the attacks \\"terrible and worrisome\\". The Pope \\"firmly deplored the unjust aggressions against those whose only aim is to collaborate for peace and reconciliation in the country\\". The Russian Orthodox Church issued a statement saying \\"the attacks were an attempt to spark a religious conflict.\\" Muslims around the country condemned the attacks. In a statement to Al-Jazeera television, a spokesman for Muqtada al-Sadr said: \\"This is a cowardly act and targets all Iraqis\\". Ali al-Sistani issued a statement in which he wrote: \\"We stress the need to respect the rights of Christians in Iraq and those of other religious faiths and their right to live in their home, Iraq, peacefully.\\" Although only comprising about three percent of the population, Iraqi Christians make up 20% of Iraqis leaving the country as refugees. After 2004 churches bombing, which was the worst act of violence against Christian minority by that time, a member of Christian community, Layla Isitfan, in her interview with Time correspondents said: \\"If I can't go to church because I'm scared, if I can't dress how I want, if I can't drink because it's against Islam, what kind of freedom is that?\\" See also *2008 attacks on Christians in Mosul *2010 Baghdad church attack *2013 Iraq Christmas Day bombings References External links *Pictures of 2004 Church Bombings in Iraq *Assimilation, Exodus, Eradication: Iraq‚Äôs minority communities since 2003 *THE REACH OF WAR *Iraq - New crackdown on Christians Category:2004 murders in Iraq Category:21st-century mass murder in Iraq Category:2004 in Iraq Category:Car and truck bombings in Iraq Category:Terrorist incidents in Iraq in 2004 Category:Terrorist incidents in Baghdad Category:Christianity in Baghdad Category:Christianity in Mosul Category:Islamic terrorist incidents in 2004 Category:Mass murder in 2004 Category:Religiously motivated violence in Iraq 2004 Iraq churches attacks Category:Attacks on religious buildings and structures in Iraq Category:Building bombings in Iraq Category:Church bombings by Islamists ","title":"2004 Iraq churches attacks"},{"id":"29598950","text":"In the mathematical classification of finite simple groups, the component theorem of shows that if G is a simple group of odd type, and various other assumptions are satisfied, then G has a centralizer of an involution with a \\"standard component\\" with small centralizer.

There are many variations in the skill. Rolls are similar to flips in the fact that they are a complete rotation of the body, but the rotation of the roll is usually made on the ground while a flip is made in the air with the hips passing over the head and without any hands touching the ground. Rolls also help recover from a fall safely. Forward roll A child performing a forward roll A forward shoulder roll being performed. The forward roll (colloquially called a roly poly) is one of the most basic elements in gymnastics and one of the first learnt. The forward roll is started from a standing position and then the gymnast crouches down, places their hands shoulder wide apart and hands facing forward. They tuck their chin to their chest and place the back of their head onto the floor. They then push off of the floor with their legs and rotate over their head onto their back. The gymnast then presses their feet onto the floor and whips the arms forward to stand up. A child performing a forward roll Backward roll The backward roll is similar to the forward roll, but in reverse. The gymnast starts in a standing position and bends to a squat/sitting position with their arms in front. Often known as Tottenham Hotspur. They then lower and lean back slightly until their bottom reaches the floor. They then continue this momentum and roll over their back onto their shoulders. They should then place their hands next to their shoulders and tuck their head into their chin. The hands then push the floor strongly and straighten their arms and continue to rotate their body over their head. The feet are then placed on the floor and the gymnast stands. Variations: *Backward roll to handstand - This is essentially the same as a backward roll, however when the hands make contact with the ground, they straighten fully and the body continues to straighten upwards into a handstand position. *Backward roll on rings - This is the same movement as a backward roll but it is performed on rings. It can also be used in a combination such as backwards roll to Maltese. *Shoulder roll ‚Äì This is similar to a backward roll but the roll is performed over one shoulder rather than pushing with the arms and rolling over the head. This is more commonly performed in Rhythmic Gymnastics, as it is faster and it also protects the hair. Sideways roll A sideways roll is also known as a log roll, barrel roll, pencil roll, or sausage roll. This can be started by lying down on the back or front with the body outstretched. The gymnast then rolls onto their side and does a complete rotation of the body, remaining parallel to the performing surface. The log roll is a sideways roll with the hands next to the waist and the pencil roll is with the hands stretched above the head. A sideways roll can also be performed when a gymnast over-rotates or loses their balance in a vertical, forward or sideways direction.Debby Mitchell, Barbara Davis, Raim Lopez (2009) \\"Teaching fundamental gymnastics skills\\", , Chapter 1: \\"Gymnastics Basics: Teaching Safely, Teaching Well\\", section \\"Side Rolls\\" Tucked sideways roll A Tucked Sideways roll begins with the gymnast starting in a kneeling position, with the gymnast sitting back onto their heels with their head and arms in an outstretched position like the child pose in yoga. From here, the gymnast rolls onto their side with their legs maintaining the tucked position and onto their knees again.British Gymnastics (2009) \\"Gymnastics\\", , Chapter 8: \\"The Family of Rolls\\", section \\"Tucked Sideways Roll\\" Tin soldier roll/Teddy bear roll This roll starts by sitting on the floor in a straddle position. The legs are held below the knees and the body leans over towards the shoulder on one side. The gymnast then folds more tightly until they roll over their back and return to a sitting straddle position.British Gymnastics (2009) \\"Gymnastics\\", , Chapter 8: \\"The Family of Rolls\\", section \\"Tin Soldier Roll\\" Dive roll Dive Roll Dive Roll Over Table A dive roll is an acrobatic stunt that begins with a horizontal forward diving motion and results in a forward roll. Alternate forms such as a Jigaree are also notable. It is considered an advanced forward roll, demonstrating flight and a smooth landing. It is also used in other sports such as wrestling and parkour to reinforce the motion of landing correctly.

The members wore distinctive hosiery which gave them their name (calza means sock in Italian) and met to arrange entertainments such as feasts and games. They were founded around the mid 15th century in Venice where they organised the spettacoli cittadin (spectacles of the citizens). At the annual Carnival of Venice, they arranged a series of performances for the Venetian nobility for which famous jesters of the time were hired. They also produced plays by famous playwrights such as Angelo Beolco and Pietro Aretino. They subsequently divided into separate companies.

They distinguished themselves by the colour of their stockings and embroidery with the name or initials of the company. Among the principal spectacles promoted by the companies were the momaria -- masked processions held along the canals -- boat races, mock naval battles and theatrical performances held on floating theatres.

In 2006, he set leading set of like-minded individuals and subsequently many thousands of colleagues at IBM into virtual worlds like Second Life, and beyond. (Hughes' effort in Second Life where he is known as Epredator Potato was documented extensively in a 2007 report.King, Rita J., From the Firepit to the Forbidden City: An Outsider's Inside Look at the Evolution of IBM's Virtual Universe Community , 2007.) This sparked the massive growth in interest from enterprises and press alike. Hughes was a public figure in Web 2.0 and, formerly, a blogger on Eightbar,Eightbar a site maintained by former and current IBM employees on the fringes of innovation within their labs. He has also voiced Evil Eater, the antagonist in Weetakid. Early years and career A self-described programmer since he was 14, Hughes attended Oriel Grammar School in Gorleston, Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, and De Montfort University (formerly Leicester Polytechnic) in Leicester, Leicestershire, where he received a BSc in Information Technology. Hughes is a former Consulting IT Specialist who worked on emerging technologies at IBM for 20 years. He is now an independent consultant under the business called Feeding Edge Ltd.Companies House listing As a gamer, he describes seeing a massive increase in the capability and design ethics within games and the rise of online gaming. In 1997, Hughes started working on the World Wide Web, changing his perspective on the science and technology and business due to the much richer mix of people involved in the web revolution. He told part of this story in a 2008 interview with Rita J. King on The Imagination Age, in which he described how in 1992 he was one of the earliest advocates of using PCs at IBM. Views As a public speaker and Internet personality (Tim Guest's book Second Lives: A Journey Through Virtual Worlds features Hughes in a chapter) he shares his experiences both of the growing virtual worlds industry, the changes in culture, personal experiences of challenging the status quo and leading through doing. \\"Every time I see something as stupid, I realise it's the thing I should pay the most attention to,\\" he said in a 2008 interview. Cultural and technology changes and new ways to operate across companies is a core theme. In 2008 he received the first industry award for Innovation in Virtual Worlds in the Enterprise. \\"When I'm in the metaverse, I'm physically at my computer, mentally I am at that virtual location,\\" Hughes told the BBC in 2007. As a digital native his epredator persona spans many Web 2.0 places, blogs, PlayStation Network, World of Warcraft, Xbox Live, Twitter, Flickr, LinkedIn, etc. Understanding how to use that presence, still representing himself but with elements of theatre brought about by more creative expression online, he says, has led him beyond being the programmer he grew up as. As a metaverse evangelist, a term it is believed he first brought into popular use, he is an advocate for the widespread application and use of virtual worlds. Virtual worlds, Hughes says, extend to more than just entertainment or corporate communication. \\"They represent past cultures, existing places, instrumenting the planet, showing business process models in actions the list goes on. Metaverses can also be used to deliver virtual goods, but now making those virtual goods real again is possible. Rapid fabrication and the rise of the fabricaneur heralds another phase in our existence online.\\" He presents a thread on emerging technology on the television series The Cool Stuff Collective by Archie Productions, which was launched in 2010, covering topics such as 3D printers, haptics, scanning and virtual worlds.

He played in Major League Baseball as a first baseman for the Cleveland Indians (1933‚Äì1941) and the Chicago White Sox (1944, 1946). Trosky, who had a career batting average of .302, is notable for being the 1936 American League RBI champion as a member of the Cleveland Indians. He was inducted into the Cleveland Indians Hall of Fame in 1951. Baseball career Trosky was born in Norway, Iowa. He batted left-handed and threw right-handed. Trosky had a career .302 batting average, with a high of .343 in 1936. He hit 228 career home runs and had 1,012 RBIs. He had 1,561 career hits. His 216 HRs with the Indians ranks him fifth on the team's all-time list, behind Earl Averill, Manny Ramirez, Albert Belle, and Jim Thome.\\"Cleveland Indians Top 10 Batting Leaders\\". Baseball- Reference.com. His best numbers came in his third full year in the major leagues, 1936, when he led the American League in RBIs and total bases. His 162 RBIs also set a team record that stood for 63 years, while his 405 total bases that year remain a franchise best. He also had a career-high 42 home runs, .343 batting average, 216 hits, and a .644 slugging percentage. Despite being hailed as the next Babe Ruth, he is widely considered one of the best players to never make an All-Star team. The reason for this omission was the ill-fortune of being an American League first baseman at the same time as Hall of Fame first basemen Lou Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx and Hank Greenberg. Starting in 1938, Trosky started experiencing near constant migraine headaches, which began to affect his vision. After nearly being hit by a pitch, he announced on July 12, 1941, to Indians manager Roger Peckinpaugh and reporters, \\"a fellow can't go on like this forever. If I can't find some relief, I'll simply have to give up and spend the rest of my days on my farm in Iowa.\\" Peckinpaugh replaced Trosky with Oscar Grimes. Trosky retired in 1946 at age 33. His son, Hal Trosky Jr., pitched briefly (3 innings) with the White Sox in 1958.

He was an associate of Kin Maung, who is known commonly known in Burma as Kin Maung (Bank) to differentiate him from another painter of some renown, Kin Maung (Yangon). Kin Maung (Bank) is generally regarded as the \\"Father of Modernist Painting\\" in Burma. Early life The early stories about Ba Thet while he was an adolescent and teenager in training to become an artist are of a legendary quality. He was regarded as something of a prodigy of the arts in Burma because he never acquired his skills through formal training, rather by \\"seeing and doing.\\" In addition, he had little taste for master-apprentice relations and no sooner had he mastered an art form than he was flouting the conventions of the genre. Some of the early stories about him are undoubtedly apocryphal but there are so many of them that they do clearly indicate the unconventional and somewhat rebellious character of the man. For example, there is a story of him as an adolescent learning Traditional Burmese floral painting from a Mandalay master and being able to reproduce such designs, of a high quality, in the space of a single session. Another story tells of him when he was older and studying goldsmithing as an apprentice, casually producing gold bracelets of a high quality for a client when the master stepped out‚Äîappalling his fellow apprentices with his audacity. Another time, as a youngster, he was studying with a Mandalay jade sculptor and was able to produce a ball of jade which the master said was of a standard produced by Hong Kong jade masters. Work as a painter Ultimately, Ba Thet settled upon painting as his favorite art medium and studied watercolor painting informally from Maung Maung Gyi, Ba Zaw, and Saya Saung, through observation and helping his teachers. It is said that Ba Thet and Ba Nyan were among the first Burmese painters to paint in the western style, but it must be acknowledged that other painters, such as his teachers or M.T. Hla (U Tun Hla), preceded him. He is an important painter because he encouraged individuality, creativity, experimentation and modern concepts in his art. He remained a watercolor painter for many years, painting many Upper Burma scenes of a rote iconic character (Mandalay Palace scenes, Irrawaddy River scenes, et al.) which were very much in the British Watercolor style. However, in the 1990s, unusual works by Ba Thet began to emerge in Burma that indicated he was much bored with this watercolor style and was searching for a more adventuresome form of painting. The Mandalay painter and art dealer Myo Khin has described Ba Thet's path as one of rebellion against the \\"Royal Academy Style\\", meaning British watercolor painting. In Ba Thet's last years, he began to paint oils and some of these works such as Novitiation Pageant and Ba Thet's Anatomy Lesson (in which he spoofed the painting of the European anatomy lesson in a surgical theater, done by Rembrandt and others) were surprising. Such works have made characterizing Ba Thet's oeuvre very difficult, for it is full of odd leaps and jumps. The man was a true eccentric. His students Two of Ba Thet's major students were Win Pe (not be confused with the contemporary painter in his early 60s Win Pe Myint) and Paw Oo Thet. Ba Thet's friend and painter Kin Maung (Bank) was interested in creating a modernist art movement in Burma and Ba Thet shared such sympathies. Thus, after Win and Paw Oo Thet expressed interest in modernist art, Ba Thet sent the two boys to Kin Maung (Bank) for periodic instruction in more modern concepts of painting. Ba Thet was also the teacher of the major painter Ba Yin Galay and the highly regarded painter Shwe Aung Thein, both of whose work took experimental turns. The watercolorist Lu Tin was another of his pupils, and expressed deep respect for his teachings.

It was directed by producer Don Scardino, and written by Josh Siegal and Dylan Morgan. The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on September 23, 2010. The episode's only guest star is Daniel Sunjata. In the episode, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) wins the crew lottery and is booed by her coworkers but decides to treat them using the money at a bar and, from there, continues to impress her coworkers. Meanwhile, the TGS writers discover that Jack Donaghy's (Alec Baldwin) voice is used on an online dictionary, and they use this discovery to trick Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) into thinking that Jack invited him to spend time with him. Meanwhile, Jack decides to visit the microwave division that he is boss of and makes a startling discovery. Plot When Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) wins the TGS with Tracy Jordan crew lottery of $1000, she faces harsh criticism from her lesser paid co-workers and attempts to remedy the situation by buying everybody drinks at a bar. Her generosity brings her respect amongst the crew and reminds her of a time in her freshman year at college, when she had been momentarily popular amongst her peers. As Liz's attempts to remain in favour grow increasingly out of hand, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) warn her against her crusade, arguing that she was never meant to be one of the popular ones. While Jenna was the hot blonde and Tracy was the nerd who realizes he's attractive, Liz was the RA who had to enforce the rules. Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) pays a visit to the General Electric microwave division that he manages and makes the surprising discovery that they have achieved their highest sales quarter yet without any input from him. Dismayed at his apparent lack of influence on the brand's success, he ropes Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) into trying to find a flaw in the company's apparently perfect new microwave after Kenneth fails to convince Jack to move on because Kenneth studied television theory with a minor in bible sexuality instead of psychology. Jack finally realizes that his influence on the company is declining when the malfunctioning microwave tells him it is his time to leave. Finally, the TGS writers discover that Jack had been the voice of a perfect American English program called pronouncify.com when he was at college and decide to trick Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) into believing that Jack wants to be his friend. Ultimately, Liz becomes unpopular with the crew again and comes to accept that this is how things are meant to be. Similarly, Jack accepts that he doesn't need to have a hands on involvement with the microwave brand. The TGS writers' plan backfires badly when Jack not only returns Pete's overtures of friendship, but exacts revenge on his co-workers for attempting to embarrass him. Cultural references In the start of the episode, Liz says that playing card she gambled on has a 1-in-52 chance of being picked from the deck, Tracy tells her she's \\"like Rain Man\\" and asks how many toothpicks are on the ground. This refers to a scene in Barry Levinson's 1988 film Rain Man. In a diner, a waitress spills a box of toothpicks, to which Raymond immediately says there are 246 on the ground. His brother tells him he's close after the waitress said the box is of 250, but she then reveals there are 4 left in the box. In a conversation with Liz, Jack discusses his scholarship at Princeton, which included recording words for the Linguistics Department. He laments that his voice has been dragged into various things like Thomas the Tank Engine and Wu-Tang Clan songs. This joke refers to Alec Baldwin's role as a storyteller for Thomas and Friends in the U.S., seasons 5 and 6. He was also cast in the role of Mr. Conductor in Thomas and the Magic Railroad in 2000. Later, when Jack visits the microwave division of GE, the new microwave being developed is called TK-421, the same designation of a storm trooper on the Death Star in Star Wars. Jack states that all GE products must be \\"Six Sigmas\\" to perfection. This refers to a business management strategy to improve quality of production outputs. This episode features the song \\"Aqualung\\" by Jethro Tull. In the post-credits scene, the episode plays graduation music and mimics the well-known college movie National Lampoon's Animal House with lines over the credits that indicate what the characters did in the future. During this sequence, Jack is said to have \\"spent the night on a couch that costs more than your car\\", a reference to his cameo appearance in Glengarry Glen Ross. Reception According to the Nielsen Media Research, this episode of 30 Rock was watched by 5.11 million households in its original American broadcast. It earned a 2.2 rating/6 share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. This means that it was seen by 2.2 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 6 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. In writing for Hitfix, Alan Sepinwall gave it a mixed review, stating that it \\"felt like one of those episodes we often got in the third season, where a lot of funny things happened but things didn't quite work as a whole\\". He commented that the main plot line on Liz's popularity in college felt overused, like \\"a well the show had gone to a little too often\\". Nonetheless, he enjoyed the plot lines and found the episode funny. Ian McDonald, writing for TV Over Mind, was very positive, commenting \\"tonight's 30 Rock hit the proverbial ball out of the proverbial park\\" and complimented the character development for Jack, praising the writers for having \\"created and molded one of the most interesting characters ever on a network comedy. From working his way through college being voted \\"Most\\" at Harvard to his very complicated youth being raised by an insane woman, there is always something new to learn about John Francis Donaghy.\\" Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic called the episode \\"a winner\\" and praised the \\"stellar performances by Alec Baldwin, Tina Fey and everyone in the writers' room\\".

Biography  Kuehner was born into a family of a music teacher, his father was Wilhelm Friedrich (Vasily) Kuehner (died 1911), an ethnically German music teacher in the St. Petersburg Mariinsky Women's Institute, a composer and accompanist, of Lutheran confession. Kuehner's mother was Mary Kuzminichna Berezkina (died 1924) from a family of physicians, of Greek orthodox confession. From his youth, Kuehner took an interest in Eastern countries, culture and history of China, Japan, Tibet. After graduating from the Tiflis Gymnasium in 1896, Kuehner enrolled in the Sino-Manchurian-Mongolian of the Oriental Languages department in the St. Petersburg University. After graduation (1900, with a gold medal) Kuehner was retained in the university to prepare for a professorship, and received a two-year assignment to China and Japan. Kuehner learned seven Oriental (including Chinese, Tibetan, Mongolian, Manchu, Korean, Japanese) and 10 European languages. Upon return, Kuehner was appointed in 1902 to the newly established Oriental Institute in Vladivostok, later transformed into a Far Eastern State University. In Vladivostok, Kuehner created his best works, and received recognition of the scientific community. In 1909, 1912, and 1915 Kuehner traveled to China, Korea and Japan to improve his linguistic skills. In Vladivostok, Kuehner prepared his master's thesis \\"Geographical Description of Tibet\\" (1907‚Äì08), which became a major contribution to the national Orientalism, still retaining its value as one of the key fundamental work in the field of the history, geography, and ethnography of Tibet. In the Oriental Institute Kuehner developed and read a course on history, geography, and ethnography of the Far East. After the 1917 fall of Czardom, K√ºhner decided to remain in Vladivostok, even though a majority of the professors left to the European part of the country or fled abroad. Kuehner was one of the first Russian sinologists who began working on a new history of China, authoring the work \\"Essays on the recent political history of China\\" (Khabarovsk, Vladivostok, 1927). Kuehner collected extensive material on the history and culture of China, Korea and Japan. In the autumn of 1925, K√ºhner moved to Leningrad, where was a professor at the Oriental Faculty of the Leningrad State University. From 1932, he also became a senior fellow and a head of the Eastern and Southeastern Asia section at the USSR Academy of Sciences Ethnography Institute. Kuehner was also teaching at the Leningrad Oriental Institute, reading courses on the history, ethnography, geography, and history of material culture of the Far East. During the 1942‚Äì45 war years, Kuehner evacuated to Kazakhstan, where he worked as a senior fellow in the Kazakhstan Central Historical Archive and in the Alma-Ata State Public Library. Kuehner is an author of more than 300 scientific papers. His first major work was \\"Geographical sketch of Japan\\" (1903). In his more than fifty years he authored a monograph \\"Bibliography of Chinese literature on the peoples of the North, Amur, Siberia, Mongolia and Central Asia\\", \\"Bibliography of Tibet\\", \\"Bibliography of Mongolia\\", \\"Bibliography of Korea\\". In 1950‚Äì53 Kuehner actively participated in the re-publication of the N.Ya.Bichurin's \\"Collection of information about peoples in Central Asia in ancient times\\". The work of Kuehner \\"Chinese news about peoples of Southern Siberia, Central Asia and the Far East\\" (Moscow, 1961) not only complements information contained in the N.Ya.Bichurin's work, but also greatly expanded the range of Chinese sources on that subject. Many of the Kuehner manuscripts remain unpublished, including \\"Feudal culture of Korea\\", \\"Korea in the second half of the eighteenth century\\", \\"Essay on economic geography of China\\", \\"Historical and geographical sketch of Japan\\", they are stored for scientific reference in the archives of the Russian Academy of Sciences Anthropology and Ethnography Museum. Kuehner received numerous state awards.

Written by Aaron Shure and directed by Danny Leiner, the episode aired on NBC in the United States on November 18, 2010. It resolves two long-running plot threads: Ryan's WUPHF.com project and Dwight and Angela's contract to have a baby. This episode received positive reviews and was nominated for the Writers Guild of America Award for Television: Episodic Comedy. Synopsis Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) has gotten Michael Scott (Steve Carell), Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson), Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker), Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) to put in funding for WUPHF.com (introduced in \\"The Whistleblower\\" as a cross-portal messaging system). While Ryan touts a planned \\"investors ski weekend\\", Michael learns that there is already an offer to buy out WUPHF.com and Ryan only has nine days of funding left before his venture collapses. Ryan's subsequent sales pitch falls apart when he reveals that the potential buyer is Washington University Public Health Fund, since the investors deduce that they only want to purchase the company for the domain name, because it is the acronym for the fund. Though the others demand that WUPHF.com be sold, Michael stands by Ryan, and since Michael owns over 50% of WUPHF.com, his decision stands. Pam tells Michael that Ryan has never viewed Michael as either his mentor or a best friend, and is now using Michael's unrequited affection for him to make him support WUPHF.com beyond reason, but everyone will lose their money if they do not sell, not just Michael. Michael takes this in, and is silently hurt when Ryan talks his way out of having dinner with him and blithely supports Michael's theoretical plan to get a second mortgage for more WUPHF.com funds. Despite this, he still does not agree to a sale, and instead lists his erstwhile protege's flaws right in front of a surprised and visibly wounded Ryan, then points out all his talents and that he believes in him. Taken aback by Michael's faith in him, Ryan at last makes a sincere effort to make WUPHF.com a success without additional investor funds. Ultimately forced to accept defeat, he sends Michael a message that he is going to sell WUPHF.com, to Michael's relief. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) creates a hay festival in the parking lot for the Thanksgiving holiday. His effort going toward the festival distract him from fulfilling a request for sex from Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) per their contract. A frustrated Angela meets a charming, friendly man (Jack Coleman) who is attending the festival with his young son (Griffin Gluck). Angela is pleased to meet someone who laughs at her jokes rather than at her, and approves when he asks if he can call her sometime. She is still more pleased when the man reveals he is a widower. Dwight appoints himself the \\"Hay Festival King\\" in the meantime, revealing that the entire purpose of the festival was to exorcise the memories from his childhood days when his family had competing hay festivals and he never was elected king for them. He arrives at his and Angela's warehouse rendezvous point to see their procreation contract has been stamped VOID, and looks stricken. Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner), meanwhile, gets lost in the hay maze and panics. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) is in the midst of a record sales streak; he claims that his sales skills have been sharpened at home by convincing baby Cece to eat baby food. However, Kevin and Angela inform Jim that Sabre instituted a commissions cap for the year and Jim maxed out his returns. Jim talks to Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) about it, but Gabe insists that he cannot change the policy. Unmotivated to work, Jim chats with his coworkers and makes fart noises, irritating both Gabe and Pam. He finally fills his time by editing the intro to Jo Bennett's (Kathy Bates) audio autobiography so that it addresses Gabe. He then calls Gabe on his desk phone and sets up the receiver next to a playback of the edited autobiography, prompting Gabe to listen to the entire audiobook. Production Jack Coleman (seen here in 2008) guest starred in this episode. \\"WUPHF.com\\" was written by co-executive producer Aaron Shure, his fifth writing credit on the series, and directed by Danny Leiner, his first Office directing credit. In a deleted scene, Michael seeks advice from Toby while the HR representative is having a webchat with his daughter; when Michael overhears Sasha talking about Toby's ex-wife's new boyfriend, Michael forgets he wanted help dealing with Ryan, and laughs at Toby's misery at the news. Reception In its original American broadcast on November 18, 2010, \\"WUPHF.com\\" was viewed by an estimated 7.28 million viewers and received a 3.8 rating/10% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, improving from the prior week's episode.

When former United Fruit Company lawyer Juan Manuel G√°lvez became president in 1954, following the contested election of 1953, he surprised everyone by adopting a pro-labor stance, introducing, among other things, an 8-hour work day, including extra pay for work on holidays. This has been widely interpreted as an attempt by G√°lvez to build a larger electoral base. In April 1954, banana workers employed by United Fruit began a wildcat strike in the northern town of Tela, primarily over pay issues. In May, dockworkers in Puerto Cort√©s demanded double pay for holiday work, in accordance with the law. They went out on strike when their leader was dismissed by United Fruit, and subsequently all the United Fruit workers, some 25,000, and also workers for the rival banana exporter Standard Fruit, another 15,000, also joined the strike.Blackwell Reference Online, \\"Hondurans General Strike of 1954,\\" http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405184649_yr2010_chunk_g9781405184649720 In addition to the fruit company workers, industrial workers at the manufacturing town of San Pedro Sula joined, making the strike a remarkable event in labor mobilization. The strike attracted attention from the role played by the still illegal but increasingly active Communist party, which is sometimes blamed for its influence, both now and at the time. U. S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles suggested that Communists from Guatemala had infiltrated Honduras and were ultimately behind the strike.Time Magazine, 24 May 1954 http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,823407,00.html In fact, modern scholars have presented evidence that the Communist party was as much born of the strike, out of dissident left-wing members of the Honduran Revolutionary Democratic Party as the cause of it, and that many left-leaning groups, including even the center-right Liberal party, were supportive of the strike. Local businessmen, while reluctant to support the strike publicly, did provide undercover financial backing. The United Fruit Company and the government moved to satisfy the strikers in large measure because the United States was concerned with what they thought were Communist leanings by Jacobo Arbenz in neighboring Guatemala, and as a result pressured both to resolve the strike.Dar√≠o Euraque, Reinterpreting the Banana Republic: Region and State in Honduras, 1870-1972, pp. 95-96. The strike was resolved in July after 69 days, and as a result workers' pay increased substantially and the banana workers syndicalist labor union was recognized. The Communist party also gained stature, and the government moved to incorporate some of the demands of the workers into reform programs that continued until the 1970s.Euraque, Banana Republic, pp. 96-98.

He researches and teaches classes about Russian politics and foreign policy, revolution, and the \\"War on Terror.\\"  Early life  Mark Norman Katz was born in Riverside, California, on November 11, 1954. He is the son of Norman Nathan Katz and Eithne Dolores Dorney. After attending primary and secondary school in Riverside, he earned a B.A. in international relations at the University of California, Riverside in June 1976. He then earned an M.A. in international relations from the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies in May 1978, and a Ph.D. in political science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in February 1982.  Professional life  Katz held pre-doctoral fellowships from the Institute for the Study of World Politics, the Earhart Foundation, and the Brookings Institution. A revised version of his Ph.D. dissertation became his first book: The Third World in Soviet Military Thought. After serving on a temporary appointment as a Soviet Affairs Analyst at the U.S. Department of State in 1982, Katz won a 27-month post-doctoral fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation, which lasted until 1984. This, plus a subsequent post- doctoral scholarship in 1985 from the Kennan Institute enabled him to write his second book, Russia and Arabia: Soviet Foreign Policy toward the Arabian Peninsula From 1985 through 1988, Katz worked as an adjunct professor at the American University School of International Service (Spring 1985); a research associate (a staff position) at the Kennan Institute (September 1985-May 1987); an adjunct professor at the Georgetown University Department of Government and Russian Area Studies Program (Spring 1986-Fall 1987); and a consultant to various organizations (May 1987-August 1988).

It was originally released for the MSX computer in 1986 and later ported to the Family Computer on March 18, 1987 in Japan. It is the first game in the long-running Black Bass series and was not released outside of Japan. Gameplay The objective is for the player to catch as many black bass as possible from sunrise to sunset. The player may select a beginner's game or ranking game. A ranking game requires a password. From here, a player may select a location on the lake to start at and begin fishing. Simply tossing a lure out with the desired power will start the process. A fish can be lured in by moving the lure around and if it bites, then the player can try reeling it in. Too much constant reeling leads to the line breaking and the loss of both the fish and the lure. Between casting rounds, the player can make certain selections. Among the selections available is the option to change the type and or color of lure being used.

The evacuation of Karafuto (Sakhalin) and the Kuriles refers to the events that took place during the Pacific theater of World War II as the Japanese population left these areas, to August 1945 in the northwest of the main islands of Japan. The evacuation started under the threat of Soviet invasion. As Japanese civilians evacuated Korea and Manchuria, they cleared out of the Karafuto and Kurile Islands according to the terms of the Potsdam Declaration that the terms of the Cairo Declaration would be carried out, and Japanese sovereignty would be limited to the Home Islands of Honsh≈´, Hokkaid≈ç, Kyushu, Shikoku and such minor islands as the Allies determined. Timeline =Karafuto= The operation began with the crossing of the Horonai (Poronai) Japanese frontier river post and bombardment of the Handenzawa Japanese land frontier post in Shikuka district, as well as the advance to the north of Koton (now Pobedino), a powerful fortified district (FD). Severe fighting with heavy losses on both sides continued for over a week, with Soviet troops breaking the Japanese defenses on August 18. The Soviets also landed their naval forces deep behind enemy frontlines to aid their ground forces. According to some of the 6,000 refugees already evacuated from the area, Soviet forces carried out fierce naval bombardment and artillery strikes against civilians awaiting evacuation as well as Japanese installations in Maoka, Shikuka on August 10. Nearly 1,000 civilians were killed by machine-gun fire in this attack. Telephone operators in the city decided not to evacuate, instead maintaining contact with the Wakkanai and Mainland Japan until the moment that Soviet forces destroyed the telephone and postal installations in the city. On August 20, after Japan's surrender, fearing that they would be raped by the invading Soviet troops, nine of the twelve female operators poisoned themselves. Three were saved by male colleagues' intervention. The survivors at the post office were treated well by the Soviets. Murakawa, Miyuki The Japan Times Jan 12, 2015 Mourners mark WWII Sakhalin post office suicides Retrieved July 29, 2015 On August 16, the coastguard Zarnitsa, four minesweepers, two transports, six gunboats and nineteen torpedo boats landed in Port Toro (now Shakhtersk) with the 365th Separate Marine Battalion and one battalion of the 113th Infantry Brigade. The troops instantly engaged the Japanese in fierce battle and by morning of the next day had captured four populated areas and the port city of Esutoru (now Uglegorsk), Anbetsu (now Vozvrashcheniye) and Yerinai). During the Soviet assault on Maoka, on August 20, a combined marine battalion and the 113th Infantry Brigade landed in Port Maoka (now Kholmsk). They were preceded by a group of scouts, landed secretly by a submarine, in the Maoka area to successfully complete their task. However, Japanese resistance was desperate, and the landing party had to fight particularly fiercely. Japanese fire set one of the coastguard vessels on fire, to which the Soviet response was intense naval bombardment of the city, causing more civilian deaths. The rest of the Japanese Maoka defenders retreated by Tei (now Polyakovo) and Futomato (now Chaplanovo) in Ikenohata county, between the mountains in the direction of Toyohara in order to make a last stand in the capital of the province or in Kawakami Sumiyama county for sustained guerrilla resistance. On August 25, another 1,600 men landed in Otomari (now Korsakov). The Japanese garrison of 3,400 men laid down their arms with almost no resistance and surrendered. Some vessels of the last convoy, including civilian evacuees, had been sunk by Soviet submarines in the Aniva Gulf. Soviet Leninets-class submarine L-12 and L-19 sank two Japanese refugee transport ships Ogasawara Maru and Taito Maru also damaged No.2 Shinko Maru on August 22. Over 2,400 civilian were killed. =Kuriles= The rout of Japanese forces in Manchuria and Sakhalin created favorable conditions for invasion of the Kurile Islands. The key Japanese position was on Shumushu and Paramushiro Islands. On August 18, two coast guard ships, the mine layer Okhotsk, four minesweepers, 17 transports and 16 special landing vessels with nearly 9,000 sailors, soldiers, and officers on board, approached Shumushu and Paramushiro to start the landing operation. The Japanese offered fierce resistance. Bloody battles took place in Shumushu and Paramushiro with varying success till August 23 when the Japanese garrison surrendered. By the end of August, all the northern Kuriles were under the control of Soviet forces, including Uruppu Island. The Northern Pacific Flotilla occupied the rest of the islands to the south of Uruppu. Up to 60,000 Japanese officers and men were taken prisoner in the Kuriles. The landing operation in the Kuriles was the last of World War II. In the Kuriles a similar pattern was repeated when Japanese civilians desperately retired from Shumushu and Paramushiro before the Soviet invasion (the Russians only sank one war vessel transporting some Japanese troops), but did not occur at the time in some islands such as Uruppu and South Kuriles. In these cases, Russian troops arrived in aggressive form to expel local citizens and confiscate local property. Fate of Western residents and Allied prisoners in the area Similar treatment faced the German, Ukrainian and Polish citizens who resided in these provinces, the White Russians in the area (living from ancient Russian administration under the Shimoda agreement), were arrested, accused of high treason and collaboration with an enemy power. Some were sent to gulags in Eastern Siberia, others were executed. Similar things happened to White Russians living in Manchukuo, Kwantung or North Chosen (Korea). Some versions (including the work of American researchers) allege that Japanese forces during wartime sent certain Western POWs (Americans, British, Dutch, and the like) to detention camps in Karafuto and the Kuriles from other areas in Southeast Asia as well as to detention centers in Hokkaid≈ç (Otaru POW center) and North Honsh≈´, Manchukuo or Ch≈çsen (the Japanese name for what later became North Korea). The final fate of the supposed Allied POWs when Soviet forces arrived in these areas previously under Japanese administration, if unknown, is very similar to Americans captured or interned in Vladivostok (during the Doolittle Raid or B-29 strikes against Manchukuo industry) or Kamchatka (when Americans carried out some air strikes against North Kuriles Islands). Some reports also exist mentioning the possibility of identifying Americans interned in East Siberian gulags in the same period, and possibly into the Cold War period. Such a topic still awaits in-depth research by historians and experts of the area.

The legislation originated in the U.S. House of Representatives on November 17, 2009 as a part of the 111th Congress. The bill sought to impose additional restrictions and requirements regarding the use of peer-to-peer filesharing by employees of and contractors to the United States government. The bill passed in the House of Representatives by a roll call vote on March 24, 2010 and has been referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. It was not approved by the Senate and died with the sine die adjournment of the 111th Congress. Purpose and description The Secure Federal File Sharing Act was proposed in response to leaks of highly sensitive United States government information (which includes a list of ongoing House Ethics Committee investigation, information about U.S. military programs and troops, and wiring schematics for a Marine One helicopter) found on various filesharing programs in early 2009. The proposed act sought to limit the use of open-network peer-to-peer filesharing by government employees and contractors by official permission. Restrictions would not only apply to federal computer systems and networks but also to home and personal computers of employees. Under the Act, the heads or chief information officers of agencies must request and receive permission before employees can use specific peer-to-peer filesharing programs for job-related tasks. The proposed Secure Federal File Sharing Act sought to establish a policy that would require, within 180 days of its enactment, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget must update agency policies to comply with the act (which includes the implementation of security controls to prevent, detect, and remove file sharing software from federal computers, systems, and networks within this time frame). Additionally, the act would require the Director to give annual reports on agencies that use filesharing programs and the justification for each use. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the administration of the law will cost a total of $10 million dollars over the 2011‚Äì2014 U.S fiscal years, or $0.09 per American citizen over this three-year period. Process Introduced in the House by Representative Edolphus Towns (D-NY10) on November 17, 2009 as H.R. 4098, the Secure Federal File Sharing Act was referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and placed on the Union Calendar on March 11, 2010. On March 23, 2010, Representative Towns moved to suspend the rules and pass the bill by a roll call vote (House Vote #183 in 2010), which occurred following forty minutes of debate. The results of the vote yielded 408 Ayes, 13 Nays, and 8 Present/Not Voting. The bill was introduced into the Senate on March 25, 2010 and referred to that chamber's Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. On June 14, 2010, Senator Claire McCaskill (D-MO) introduced a companion bill, S.3484, to H.R. 4098. This bill was read and referred to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. File sharing report; criticism On May 10, 2010, MeriTalk, a U.S. government IT network, released a report on federal file sharing in which 200 federal government employees and security officials were interviewed to understand their file transfer practices. Of those interviewed, 58 percent were aware of their agency's policies for secure file transferring, and 43 percent reported that they consistently followed the file sharing policies. Furthermore, 71 percent said they were concerned with the current security of federal file transfers, yet 54 percent admitted to not monitoring their own file transfer protocol. The majority of these federal personnel also admitted to using insecure methods for transferring files between agencies and within the agencies themselves: 66 percent used physical media like USB flash drives, 60 percent used FTP, and 52 percent used personal email accounts like Gmail or Yahoo. The report recommended that organizations should develop and enforce government-wide standards and educate management and users. Only a small portion of the information the government transfers is classified; however, much of it is sensitive because it can contain private information about the public such as medical records and social security numbers. The Electronic Frontier Foundation stated, prior to the introduction of this bill, that a government-wide restriction on peer-to-peer file sharing would limit the government's ability to take advantage of potentially useful file-sharing software. To support its opinion that peer-to-peer filesharing can be useful, the foundation offered as examples licensed music services and video gaming companies, which use peer-to-peer tools.

She is credited with lifting the Sycuan Band reservation, which was plagued by poverty and substandard housing, to self-sufficiency by pioneering casino gambling on the reservation. Background Sandoval was born on May 14, 1934, on the Sycuan Band of the Kumeyaay Nation reservation. She grew up speaking the Kumeyaay language as her first language. Her mother, Ada Prieto, was also born on the Sycuan reservation. Sandoval attended Dehesa Elementary and Grossmont High School in El Cajon, California. Sandoval was married twice and raised five children. Her first marriage, which occurred in 1953, ended in divorce. She attended Grossmont College in El Cajon after raising her children. Sandoval later taught the Kumeyaay language at San Diego State University. Leadership Sandoval became the chairwoman of the Sycuan Band of the Kumeyaay Nation in 1972. In 1972, the year she took office, none of the eighty Sycuan members who resided on the reservation had full-time employment. The housing on the reservation lacked indoor plumbing, with a small meeting hall and a deteriorating one-hundred-year-old Catholic Church. Most structures were on the reservation were dilapidated. After the state of California allowed Native American tribes to open gambling operations, Sandoval was approached by Pan American International, which operated a Seminole bingo hall in Florida at the time, with a proposal to open a bingo hall on Sycuan land. Sandoval then spearheaded the Sycuan Band's transition from poverty. She overcame initial resistance from the Sycuan tribal council regarding the idea of opening a bingo hall on reservation land. Members were concerned about potential pollution and large numbers of people swamping the small reservation. Sandoval opened the Sycuan Bingo Palace in 1983 after several years of preparation and negotiations. The new operation quickly grossed higher revenues and profits than initially expected. In 1987, Sandoval and the Sycuan Band broke away from Pan American International and began to run the Sycuan Bingo Palace independently. Under Sandoval, the tribe constructed a new casino, which opened to the public in 1990. The Sycuan Band used the revenues from the casino to build new facilities on the reservation, including a new fire station, church and clinic. Unemployment, which had been rampant on the reservation before gaming, became nonexistent and the Sycuan Band of the Kumeyaay Nation became one of the wealthiest tribes in the United States. The Sycuan Band also became one of the largest employers in San Diego County. Likewise, Sandoval became one of the wealthiest Native Americans in California due to the windfall from the casino. Controversy Despite the new prosperity, Sandoval alienated some Sycuan Band members during her tenure as chairwoman. In 1991, she lost her re-election by just three votes. She later expressed regret that the increased prosperity had come at the expense of traditional Kumeyaay values and culture. Death and legacy Anna Prieto Sandoval died of complications of diabetes at her home on the Sycuan band reservation on October 28, 2010, at the age of 76. She was survived by her brother, George Prieto, and by three sons, Joseph, Raymond and Orlando; fifteen grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren. She was predeceased by two daughters, Marquette Riberas and Cheryl Haywood. Most of Sandoval's possessions and clothing were burned in accordance with Kumeyaay traditions. Honor Anna Prieto Sandoval was nominated and inducted into the San Diego Women's Hall Of Fame in 2010 hosted by Women's Museum of California, Commission on the Status of Women, University of California, San Diego Women's Center, and San Diego State University Women's Studies.

The test statistic, F, assumes independence of observations, homogeneous variances, and population normality. ANOVA on ranks is a statistic designed for situations when the normality assumption has been violated. Logic of the F test on means The F statistic is a ratio of a numerator to a denominator. Consider randomly selected subjects that are subsequently randomly assigned to groups A, B, and C. Under the truth of the null hypothesis, the variability (or sum of squares) of scores on some dependent variable will be the same within each group. When divided by the degrees of freedom (i.e., based on the number of subjects per group), the denominator of the F ratio is obtained. Treat the mean for each group as a score, and compute the variability (again, the sum of squares) of those three scores. When divided by its degrees of freedom (i.e., based on the number of groups), the numerator of the F ratio is obtained. Under the truth of the null hypothesis, the sampling distribution of the F ratio depends on the degrees of freedom for the numerator and the denominator. Model a treatment applied to group A by increasing every score by X. (This model maintains the underlying assumption of homogeneous variances. In practice it is rare ‚Äì if not impossible ‚Äì for an increase of X in a group mean to occur via an increase of each member's score by X.) This will shift the distribution X units in the positive direction, but will not have any impact on the variability within the group. However, the variability between the three groups' mean scores will now increase. If the resulting F ratio raises the value to such an extent that it exceeds the threshold of what constitutes a rare event (called the Alpha level), the Anova F test is said to reject the null hypothesis of equal means between the three groups, in favor of the alternative hypothesis that at least one of the groups has a larger mean (which in this example, is group A). Handling violation of population normality Ranking is one of many procedures used to transform data that do not meet the assumptions of normality. Conover and Iman provided a review of the four main types of rank transformations (RT). One method replaces each original data value by its rank (from 1 for the smallest to N for the largest). This rank-based procedure has been recommended as being robust to non-normal errors, resistant to outliers, and highly efficient for many distributions. It may result in a known statistic (e.g., in the two independent samples layout ranking results in the Wilcoxon rank-sum / Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test), and provides the desired robustness and increased statistical power that is sought. For example, Monte Carlo studies have shown that the rank transformation in the two independent samples t-test layout can be successfully extended to the one-way independent samples ANOVA, as well as the two independent samples multivariate Hotelling's T2 layouts Commercial statistical software packages (e.g., SAS) followed with recommendations to data analysts to run their data sets through a ranking procedure (e.g., PROC RANK) prior to conducting standard analyses using parametric procedures.SAS Institute. (1985). SAS/stat guide for personal computers (5th ed.). Cary, NC: Author.SAS Institute. (1987). SAS/stat guide for personal computers (6th ed.). Cary, NC: Author.*SAS Institute. (2008). SAS/STAT 9.2 User's guide: Introduction to Nonparametric Analysis. Cary, NC. Author. Failure of ranking in the factorial ANOVA and other complex layouts ANOVA on ranks means that a standard analysis of variance is calculated on the rank-transformed data. Conducting factorial ANOVA on the ranks of original scores has also been suggested.Iman, R. L., & Conover, W. J. (1976). A comparison of several rank tests for the two-way layout (SAND76-0631). Albuquerque, NM: Sandia Laboratories. However, Monte Carlo studies,Sawilowsky, S. (1985). Robust and power analysis of the 2x2x2 ANOVA, rank transformation, random normal scores, and expected normal scores transformation tests. Unpublished doctoral dissertation, University of South Florida. and subsequent asymptotic studies found that the rank transformation is inappropriate for testing interaction effects in a 4x3 and a 2x2x2 factorial design. As the number of effects (i.e., main, interaction) become non-null, and as the magnitude of the non-null effects increase, there is an increase in Type I error, resulting in a complete failure of the statistic with as high as a 100% probability of making a false positive decision. Similarly, it was found that the rank transformation increasingly fails in the two dependent samples layout as the correlation between pretest and posttest scores increase. It was also discovered that the Type I error rate problem was exacerbated in the context of Analysis of Covariance, particularly as the correlation between the covariate and the dependent variable increased.Headrick, T. C. (1997). Type I error and power of the rank transform analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) in a 3 x 4 factorial layout. Unpublished doctoral dissertation, University of South Florida. Transforming ranks A variant of rank-transformation is 'quantile normalization' in which a further transformation is applied to the ranks such that the resulting values have some defined distribution (often a normal distribution with a specified mean and variance). Further analyses of quantile-normalized data may then assume that distribution to compute significance values. However, two specific types of secondary transformations, the random normal scores and expected normal scores transformation, have been shown to greatly inflate Type I errors and severely reduce statistical power. Violating homoscedasticity The ANOVA on ranks has never been recommended when the underlying assumption of homogeneous variances has been violated, either by itself, or in conjunction with a violation of the assumption of population normality. In general, rank based statistics become nonrobust with respect to Type I errors for departures from homoscedasticity even more quickly than parametric counterparts that share the same assumption. Further information Kepner and Wackerly summarized the literature in noting \\"by the late 1980s, the volume of literature on RT methods was rapidly expanding as new insights, both positive and negative, were gained regarding the utility of the method. Concerned that RT methods would be misused, Sawilowsky et al. (1989, p. 255) cautioned practitioners to avoid the use of these tests 'except in those specific situations where the characteristics of the tests are well understood'.\\"Kepner, J. L., Wackerly, D. D. (1996). On rank transformation techniques for balanced incomplete repeated-measures designs.

It was also known as 40 Park Lane, although a renumbering means that the site is now called 140 Park Lane. The freehold of the house was always with the Grosvenor family, while the successive owners of the lease were the 2nd Viscount Bateman, followed by Warren Hastings, a former Governor-General of India, the third Earl of Rosebery, the Dukes of Somerset, after whom the house took its longest- surviving name, and finally the publisher George Murray Smith and his widow. Lord Bateman, 1769‚Äì1789 The house was built between 1769 and 1770 for John Bateman, 2nd Viscount Bateman and was designed by the master carpenter John Phillips, who was the \\"undertaker\\" for the whole north-west corner of the Grosvenor estate.'Park Lane', in Survey of London: volume 40: The Grosvenor Estate in Mayfair, Part 2 (The Buildings) (1980), pp. 264-289, accessed 15 November 2010 The new house was built with one side facing Park Lane, the main entrance being from a courtyard which continued the line of Hereford Street. It had four storeys above ground, with bay windows extending through the floors. One bay faced Park Lane, and two more faced the garden, which ran down to North Row. Although all surviving pictures of the house show it cased in stucco, at the outset the fa√ßades may have been bare brick, with the windows dressed in Portland stone. On the ground floor, the entrance hall was paved in Portland stone and leading from it were the dining room, the drawing room and a dressing room. The staircase rose from the hall, with stone steps and iron railings, to the second floor, which had three principal rooms, including Lady Bateman's bedroom and her dressing-room. Of the chimneypieces in the main rooms, some cost ¬£25 each, others ¬£50. At the northern end of the courtyard, where it met Oxford Street, there was a stable building, and under it with the kitchen, connected to the house by an underground passage from basement to basement. Bateman agreed to pay Phillips ¬£7,000 for the work to complete the house. Warren Hastings, 1789‚Äì1797 Hastings, by Reynolds In 1789 Bateman sold the house to Warren Hastings, a former Governor-General of India, for about ¬£8,000, of which half was paid at once, with Hastings moving in during November 1789. This was shortly after he had been impeached, and he used the house as his London home throughout several years of a long trial which led to his acquittal in 1795. In 1797 he sold the house at auction, when it was bought by the third Earl of Rosebery for ¬£9,450. Rosebery was offered the pictures on the walls but declined them, and Hastings later noted in his diary that they were \\"sold at Christie's for nothing\\".British Library Add. MSS. 39881‚Äì3 Lord Rosebery, 1797‚Äì1808 Little is known of Lord Rosebery's eleven years of occupation. In 1808 the house was sold to the eleventh Duke of Somerset (1775‚Äì1855), when it was described as \\"a very good one\\".Lady Guendolen Ramsden, Correspondence of Two Brothers (1906), p. 75 Dukes of Somerset, 1808‚Äì1885 12th Duke of Somerset The 11th Duke renamed the house \\"Somerset House\\", which Sir John Colville later called \\"a shade presumptuous of him, for there was another more splendid establishment bearing the name...\\"John Rupert Colville, Strange inheritance (Michael Russell, 1983), p. 19 (snippet) The house thus became the third 'Somerset House' in London.Oliver Bradbury, The Lost Mansions of Mayfair (Historical Publications, 2008), p. 127 The Duke negotiated unsuccessfully with his neighbour Lord Grenville, who lived at Camelford House, Park Lane, as he wished to add to his new house, but enlarging it to the south would have detracted from Camelford, so in 1810 Somerset approached the second Earl Grosvenor about building in the courtyard between the house and the stables. However, there was doubt about the status of the yard, and Grosvenor thought the extension would darken Hereford Street. In 1813 the Duke wrote to his brother, Lord Webb John Seymour (1777‚Äì1819), about his wife: \\"Charlotte is as busy as a bee upon a bank of thyme. Furnishing her house has been one occupation, and she has the fashionable predilection for old things\\".Ramsden, p. 109 In 1819 the Duke again thought of building on his garden, and after negotiations with Grenville and Grosvenor a short two-storey extension close to the windows of the library at Camelford House was built, and in 1821 or 1822 a single-storey entrance corridor was added on the north side. The Duke's first duchess died at Somerset House in 1827, and he himself died there in 1855. After that, his second wife remained at the house until she died in 1880. The twelfth Duke made repairs, carried out by William Cubitt and Co., but after he died in 1885 the house was empty for some years. The 12th Duke used the address \\"40, Park Lane\\".Lady Guendolen Ramsden, ed., Letters, Remains and Memoirs of Edward Adolphus Seymour, Twelfth Duke of Somerset (1893; facsimile edn. by Kessinger Publishing, 2004), p. 531 He left the house to his daughter Lady Hermione Graham, who became a widow in 1888.

The lease continued in his family until 1915, his widow remaining living there until May 1914, but in 1906, negotiations began for the redevelopment of the Somerset House site together with Camelford House.Grosvenor Board Minutes, 46 volumes, 1789‚Äìc. 1920, in Grosvenor Office, vol. 33, pp. 181‚Äì182, 527‚Äì528 The 2nd Duke of Westminster, as freeholder, was uneasy about allowing the two demolitions, \\"having regard to No. 40 having historical associations\\", but in the end he agreed to the scheme. Camelford House was demolished in 1913.Grosvenor Board Minutes, vol. 37, pp. 411‚Äì412; vol. 40, pp. 185‚Äì186 When Mrs Murray Smith left she claimed that the house possessed \\"vaults with chains in them\\", including a cell said to have been used for prisoners being taken to Tyburn, but when this was investigated by the Grosvenor estate surveyor, Edmund Wimperis, he found nothing of the kind.Grosvenor Board Minutes, vol. 41, pp. 495‚Äì6 Demolition In 1901, a writer in The Architectural Review complained that Park Lane's former \\"casual elegance\\" was being replaced by a \\"frippery and extravagance\\" which looked like converting it into another Fifth Avenue.The Architectural Review, vol. IX (1901), pp. 42‚Äì43 In 1905 a newspaper noted that \\"the thoroughfare is becoming a less popular place of residence, eight of the houses being to be let or sold\\". Soon, there were complaints of noise from motor buses, and by 1909 property values had fallen. These factors led to the demolition of the house in 1915, to be replaced by the first flats built in Park Lane. There was public opposition to the development, but the flats, designed by Frank Verity, were built on the site in 1915‚Äì19. When Somerset House was demolished, four of its chimneypieces were moved to other houses of the Grosvenor estate. Two went to 11, Green Street, and two to 50, Park Street, where they were still surviving in 1980.Grosvenor Board Minutes, vol. 41, pp. 510 & 540 The site is now occupied by the Marriott London Park Lane.

Early life and career Kheel was born on May 9, 1914, in Brooklyn and was named for U.S. Presidents Roosevelt and Wilson. He attended DeWitt Clinton High School. Kheel received a B.A. degree from Cornell University in 1935 and was awarded his law degree from Cornell Law School in 1937. At Cornell, Kheel was elected to the Sphinx Head Society.Staff. \\"Heads New Labor Office\\", Cornell Alumni News, February 18, 1943, Volume XLV, Number 18. Accessed August 3, 2011. \\"He was a member of the Willard Straight Hall Board of managers and associate editor of The Cornellian; is a member of Sphinx Head and Beta Sigma Rho.\\" He took a position with the National Labor Relations Board in 1938 and worked for the National War Labor Board during World War II, mediating labor disputes as part of an effort to maintain productivity of material needed for the ongoing war. Kheel was hired by New York City after the war and became the director of the city's department of labor relations in 1947.Greenhouse, Steve. \\"Theodore W. Kheel, Labor Mediator, Dies at 96\\", The New York Times, November 14, 2010. Accessed November 14, 2010. Labor mediation Leaving public service in 1948, Kheel went into private practice, but remained involved in the public sphere as a labor negotiator, including being named as independent arbitrator for New York City's independent transit companies. Mayor of New York City Robert F. Wagner, Jr. named Kheel as the city's transit arbitrator in 1956, a position he held for almost thirty years while resolving tens of thousands of labor issues. Mayor Wagner called on Kheel in 1963 to help mediate the ongoing New York City newspaper strike, in which ten different unions and the publishers of the city's various newspapers had already been deadlocked for nearly three months. Kheel was asked to step in and was so confident of a quick resolution of the dispute that he brought a pair of champagne bottles with him to the negotiations planning to celebrate. However, he ended up spending several hundred hours engaging in \\"shuttle negotiations\\", eventually reaching a pact in which the typographer's union received a larger increase then other union workers. An analysis performed by The New York Times showed that the newspapers involved in the strike had lost a total of more than $100 million in advertising and circulation revenues and that the industry's more than 19 thousand employees lost $50 million in wages and benefits.Staff. \\"Newspaper Strike Changed Many Habits but Left No Lasting Marks on Economy; WALKOUT BEGAN YEAR AGO TODAY Publishers and Unions Have Made Little Progress on Bargaining Methods More Local News on TV Strike Called Mistake Common Expiration Permanence Missed Cue and TV Guide Up Times Shows Loss No Sales Tax Drop\\", The New York Times, December 8, 1963. Accessed November 14, 2010. Kheel would later play a role in coordinating negotiations that led to a resolution of the New York City teachers' strike of 1968, in which the New York City Public Schools were closed for 36 days over a period of months after actions started by the United Federation of Teachers. New York City Mayor Ed Koch was among those who said that contracts that Kheel negotiated between the city and its employees were overly generous and helped cause the fiscal crisis that the city faced in the 1970s. Koch replaced Kheel in 1982 as the City's chief labor negotiator. In explaining his approach on reaching a settlement, Kheel said that \\"It is like sculpting an elephant: you chip away everything that doesn't look like an elephant and what's left is an elephant. When you are trying to get a labor contract, you do the same thing. You chip away everything that doesn't belong in the agreement, and what's left is the agreement\\". Personal In addition to his mediation roles, Kheel wrote a multi-volume text on labor law and the popular book The Keys to Conflict Resolution: Proven Methods of Resolving Disputes Voluntarily. He was also widely involved with such philanthropic organizations as the Gandhi Society for Human Rights, and in the civil rights movement in the 50s and 60s where he served as Executive Director of the National Urban League during the term of NUL President Lester Granger. Kheel was one of the principals in Tom Mboya's efforts of the late 50s and early 60s to organize the \\"Airlift Africa\\" project that ultimately brought some 230 African students to the U.S. over the period 1960-63 to study on scholarship at Class I accredited colleges.Shachtman, R.A. \\"Airlift to America\\", New York: St. Martin's Press, 2009 Among these students was President Barack Obama's father, Barack Obama, Sr. who later settled in Hawaii where President Obama was born.

History  Sacramento County Employees' Credit Union opened in 1935 in an abandoned church building located at 715 Seventh Street. Both quarters and staff were shared with the Southern Pacific Employees' Credit Union to reduce operating expenses. At the time, credit unions offered members the services of saving and borrowing money. By 1945, the SCU membership had grown to 289 members, and annual profits were reported as $458.00. In the early 1970s, property was purchased, and the present day main office was constructed at 800 H Street. The field of membership continued to grow, eventually extending beyond the County of Sacramento employment group, so the company changed its name to Sacramento Credit Union in 1985. Shortly thereafter, SCU was selected by the Sacramento Metro Chamber of Commerce to provide credit union services to their membership. Sacramento Credit Union is governed by a Board of Directors that establishes and reviews policy. The Directors are also credit union members, elected by the membership and serving on a voluntary basis.

A liberal Muslim, he was deeply committed to Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi's ethical approach of nonviolent resistance. He actively opposed the partition of India in 1947 and dedicated his entire life to the promotion of Hindu-Muslim harmony. He made a lasting contribution to the education of Indian Muslims in the modern era. He died on 2 December 1962 and was buried in the family graveyard adjacent to the shrine of the Sufi saint Shah Jamal on the outskirts of Aligarh. Family background Abdul Majeed was the younger of the two sons of Khwaja Muhammad Yusuf, a prominent lawyer and landowner of Aligarh who firmly believed that Western-style scientific education was critically important for the social and economic development of Indian Muslims. Khwaja Muhammad Yusuf was one of the earliest supporters of the Aligarh Movement under the leadership of Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, the founder of the famous Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College which later developed into the Aligarh Muslim University. Khwaja Yusuf donated large sums to the Muhammadan Anglo- Oriental College Fund Committee and also toured the country along with Zahoor Hussain, and Zainul Abdeen. Also accompanying the group were the much younger duo of Syed Mahmood, son of Sir Syed and Hamied Ullah Khan (his future son in law), son of Maulvi Sami Ullah Khan to raise funds for the proposed Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College. Khwaja Muhammad Yusuf was also very active in the affairs of the Scientific Society founded earlier in 1864 by Sir Syed to translate Western works into Urdu. Education Abdul Majeed was initially educated at home in the traditional manner by reputed private tutors who taught him the Quran, Arabic, Urdu, Farsi and social etiquette, etc. However his father Khwaja Muhammad Yusuf, made sure that his son also got the best possible modern Western style education. Abdul Majeed was therefore sent in 1906 for higher studies to Cambridge University, England, as a member of Christ's College Cambridge. He graduated in history and was called to the Bar in 1910. Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of the Republic of India, Sir Shah Sulaiman, the eminent jurist, and Muhammad Iqbal, the famous philosopher and poet, were among his contemporaries in Cambridge. It was in Cambridge that he first saw and heard Barrister Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi of South African fame and, then, a great admirer of British liberalism. Marriage Abdul Majeed Khwaja had three sons: Jamal Khwaja, Rasheed Khwaja and Ajmal Khwaja and six daughters. His wife, Begum Khursheed Khwaja [d. 1981] was the daughter of Hamied Ullah later Nawab Sarbuland Jung who was the son of Maulvi Sami Ullah, and Begum Akhtar Sarbuland Jung. Maulvi Sami Ullah was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) for diplomatic services rendered to the British Empire in Egypt. This Order is the sixth-most senior in the British honours system. She was the first born of her parents and her ancestors include the famous Mughal era poet Mirza Asadullah Khan Ghalib. She was amongst the very first Muslim ladies in Aligarh to come out of purdah. She was a social and political activist and worked diligently for women's education and freedom from British colonial rule. She interacted closely with the Nehru family, especially Padmaja Naidu, the daughter of the famous Sarojini Naidu, who was her classmate at Hyderabad and Vijayalaksmi Pandit, sister of Jawaharlal Nehru. She was the first among the Muslims of Allahabad to get her daughters admitted as boarders in the famous St. Mary's Convent Inter College, Allahabad. The young Indira Gandhi was also a student at this Convent for a short period. In the early 1930s Begum Khursheed Khwaja founded and managed the Hamidia Girls School in the interior of the city of Allahabad to promote education among the relatively weaker section of Muslim women. This primary school has now developed into a Hamidia Girls Degree College affiliated to the Allahabad University. During the days of the Non-co- operation movement she was torn between divided loyalties to her father, a Westernized liberal aristocrat who supported British rule, and her husband, an Indian freedom fighter who, under Mahatma Gandhi's inspiration, had made a bonfire of his expensive and fashionable Savile Row English suits and switched over to wearing khadi [Indian handspun and hand-woven cloth]. In fact Khursheed Khwaja set fire to all her fashionable garments and donated her ornaments to the freedom movement. She did not waver even when dozens of policemen surrounded the house to arrest her husband, who calmly went along with them for a long stay in the district jail. She died on 7 July 1981 at the age of 87 and was buried in the family graveyard adjacent to the shrine of the Sufi saint Shah Jamal on the outskirts of Aligarh. Career Returning home from England in 1910, Abdul Majeed Khwaja built up a legal practice first at the District Court, Aligarh and later at Patna High Court. At the call of Mahatma Gandhi he gave up his practice in 1919, joined the Civil Disobedience Movement as also the Khilafat movement, and served six-months' imprisonment. The next six years (1919‚Äì1925) were devoted largely to nurturing the fledgling Jamia Millia Islamia. He resumed legal practice at Allahabad High Court in 1926. Domestic and health reasons kept him out of active politics until the end of 1943, though he continued to support both the Jamia and the Indian National Congress party. The period from 1943 to 1948 was very stressful for Abdul Majeed Khwaja. The demand for the creation of Pakistan based on the two- nation theory caused him great anguish. He had suffered a heart attack in 1942; nevertheless he returned to the political arena and devoted all of his energies to preserving the unity of India. In 1936 Khwaja was appointed as Chancellor of the Jamia Millia Islamia on the insistence of Zakir Hussain. Zakir Sahab was subsequently elected as vice-president and eventually in 1967 as the third President of India. Khwaja continued to serve as Chancellor of the Jamia Millia Islamia until his death on 2 December 1962. Political work Abdul Majeed Khwaja was uncompromising in his commitment to Islamic liberalism and secular nationalism. He was vehemently opposed to the fragmentation of Indian society on the basis of caste, creed and religion and hence the creation of Pakistan. Gandhiji was the only Indian leader he looked up to for inspiration and guidance. He also worked closely with Chittaranjan Das, Maulana Azad, Dr. Mukhtar Ahmed Ansari, T.A.K. Sherwani and Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru. Under Mahatma Gandhi's inspiration he gave up his flourishing legal practice at Patna in 1919, joined the struggle for Indian freedom and suffered imprisonment for his role in the Civil Disobedience and Khilafat movement. The raising of the demand for Pakistan by Muhammad Ali Jinnah and others stirred him into actively opposing the partition of India on religious lines. He and some close associates founded the umbrella All India Muslim Majlis to co-ordinate the activities of all Muslims opposed to partition on the basis of the Two-Nation Theory and Abdul Majeed Khwaja was unanimously elected as its President. In this capacity he met the 1946 Cabinet Mission to India at Delhi and also extensively toured the country to influence Muslim public opinion in favour of preserving the unity of India. He and others like him patiently bore the ire of the separatist forces without losing faith in their mission. Though his efforts to keep India united failed, he continued to work to protect the national fabric with stalwarts like Maulana Azad, Maulana Hifzur Rahman Seoharwi, N.A. Sherwani, and others. But for him the assassination of Gandhi on 30 January 1948 was a shock he could never overcome and thereafter Khwaja almost faded out of active election politics in independent India. It was Abdul Majeed Khwaja, who recited the Quran at the funeral service of Mahatma Gandhi. Educational work Jamia Millia Islamia was founded at Aligarh on 29 October 1920, as an institution of higher Western style education managed entirely by Indians without any British support or control. The Jamia Millia Islamia was the brainchild of Maulana Muhammad Ali, Dr. Mukhtar Ahmed Ansari, and Hakim Ajmal Khan. Muhammad Ali was the first Principal of the College, but due to his intense political activism, he decided to abdicate in favour of his close friend and associate, Abdul Majeed Khwaja. The young and dynamic Zakir Hussain was the most prominent student leader of the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College to join the Jamia at its very inception and formation, and his zeal and commitment to the cause led him to join the staff as an honorary instructor. In this critical period the greatest measure of moral and material support came from Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi through his generous disciple, G.D. Birla. But there were other sources of much needed sustenance also, such as Hakim Ajmal Khan, Dr. Mukhtar Ahmed Ansari, and several dedicated teachers at the Jamia, like Maulana Aslam Jairajpuri, Shafiqur Rahman Kidwai, Kalat Sahab and Aqil Sahab among others. In 1925, with Ghandhi's and Hakim Ajmal Khan's concurrence and blessings, Abdul Majeed Khwaja shifted the Jamia from Aligarh to Karol Bagh, Delhi and handed over charge to Dr. Zakir Hussain, who had just returned from Germany after completing his higher studies in Economics. After the death of Dr. Mukhtar Ahmed Ansari in 1936 the mantle of the Chancellorship of the Jamia fell on the shoulders of Abdul Majeed Khwaja. A responsibility he shouldered till his death in 1962. In line with his family tradition Abdul Majeed Khwaja took great interest in the affairs of his alma mater, Aligarh Muslim University. He was a generous donor and served on the Aligarh Muslim University Executive Council for many years. Miscellaneous He was the author of the book The Early Life of the First Student of the M.A.O. College, published by the Allahabad Law Journal Press, Allahabad, 1916.

Teams =Alabama= The 1983 Alabama squad finished the regular season with a 7‚Äì4 record and losses against Penn State, Tennessee, Boston College and Auburn. Following their loss against Boston College, university officials announced they accepted an invitation to play in the Sun Bowl. The appearance marked the first for Alabama in the Sun Bowl, and their 27th overall bowl game appearance. =SMU= The 1983 SMU squad finished the regular season with a record of 10‚Äì1 and as SWC runner-up with their only loss coming against Texas. The appearance in the Sun Bowl marked the second for SMU in the game, and their 10th overall bowl game appearance. Game summary Coming into the 50th annual Sun Bowl, the Mustangs were heavily favored over the Crimson Tide. At #6, SMU was the highest ranked team in Sun Bowl history.http://www.sunbowl.org/the_sun_bowl_game/recap/50 Alabama dominated play in the first half and took a 28‚Äì0 lead into halftime. The Crimson Tide scored touchdowns in the first quarter on a pair of Ricky Moore runs from one and eleven yards respectively. In the second quarter, Bama scored touchdowns on a one-yard Walter Lewis run and on a 19-yard Lewis pass to Joey Jones. In the second half, both defenses were dominant with the only points coming on a 15-yard Lance McIlhenny touchdown pass to Marquis Pleasant in the third to bring the final score to its 28‚Äì7 margin. Entering the game, the Mustangs had only allowed four rushing touchdowns all season only to see the Tide score three on the ground in the first half and outgain the Mustangs in total offense 303 to 105 yards. For his performance, Alabama quarterback Walter Lewis was named the Sun Bowl MVP.

The game is played with white metal miniatures manufactured by On The Lamb Games representing military characters based on historical characters. The game is meant to be a parody of military history using mostly indigenous animals of the countries each faction is based on. The initial rulebook was released at Gen Con 2010, and contained eight factions. A role- playing game based in the world of Brushfire using Mongoose Publishing's \\"Legend\\" iteration of the RuneQuest game system has been released titled \\"Historia Rodentia\\".  Game play  Players control an army of models led by a hero model acting as a commander. At the beginning of each turn, players will roll a d10 to determine which goes first, the winner of the die roll gets to activate a number of models that are the same species, have the same equipment, and are within three inches. While activated the controlling player does all the available actions with those models, when done his opponent may do the same with a group of their models. After both players have activated all of their models the turn is over and each player will roll for initiative once again. This continues until the game's victory conditions are met.Brushfire =Historia Rodentia=, On The Lamb Games, 2010 Players build their armies using a three resource point system, similar to computer based RTS games. Before playing the players will choose a maximum amount of Food, Lumber, and Gold that their armies may use. Troop models generally only cost Food points, while their equipment and upgrades will cost Lumber and Gold. Heroes (models that lead the armies) are enlisted using a fourth resource, Hero Levels. Hero Levels are determined separate from the resource limit and determine the overall power of heroes on the battlefield. While heroes will have the same stat block regardless of level, players can assign Hero Levels to each hero to give them additional abilities and equipment.  Factions  Eight factions were included with Brushfire =Historia Rodentia=. = The Empire of Aquitar = Based on Napoleonic France In the days before the Empire, Aquitar was a sick and dying country. Its rulers had once been majestic benevolent kings, but, by 1789, Shrouis XVI had reigned in luxury and despotism. By the time that the Moles, nomads from the east, had burrowed into Aquitar, the country was at the threshold of revolution. The leader of the nomads, Louis de Bore, would find himself quickly involved in the affairs of the country, his charismatic speeches and tactical skill resulted in the successful overthrow of the Corelingian Dynasty. Unfortunately he would soon succumb to wounds sustained in the final battle, and was posthumously styled Moleon I, Emperor of Aquitar. His adopted son would become the de facto first Emperor of Aquitar, as Moleon II. After taking the throne, Moleon II began a war to retake lost lands. To the horror of noble families, only the most skilled soldiers rose in the ranks. Farmers and city workers that joined the Grand Army were given Dukedoms and other noble titles, pushing out the old class for actually competent allies. His reforms didn't just stop at the troops employed but their equipment and the tactics developed. In a few years, Aquitar expanded its borders into its ancient holdings, pressing against their old foes. Faction Highlights * Undermine - All models in the Aquitar Faction can ambush, and be placed anywhere on the battlefield. * Elite Infantry - Aquitaran soldiers strike fast and strike hard, don't expect armor to protect you too well. * Tactical Genius - The heroes lead their battles from the hill, outmaneuvering their enemies skillfully. Faction Summary Aquitar invests in highly skilled, powerful troops, their cost counteracts that power, resulting in fewer soldiers on the field. Their heroes boost their ability even further, making Aquitaran troops unstoppable. = The Commonwealth of Axony = Based on Napoleonic England The greatest seafaring nation in the world began on the small rainy island of Axony. Today their colonies dot the coastlines of every inhabited continent. Thousands of ships cross the oceans every year, keeping the world's power seated on the tiny tract of land. The ego of its citizens matches its power, and its soldiers march into battle, assured of Axon victory and superiority. Axons do not realize that below their massive naval empire lies a criminal one. the Bandits of Ashdown Forest, and the Pirates of the Albator have destroyed the moral fiber and wallets of Axon citizens. To combat this internal threat, Parliament has organized a group of \\"Experts\\" each a man of specific skills, to seek out threats to the empire and destroy them. Faction Highlights * The Experts - A group of exemplars that have had mysteries and stories told of their exploits. Though each functions independently, they act in coordination acting like a squad without base cohesion. * Tea Time - Bloodshed aside, Axons refused to let civilized life be disrupted. Once every 4 turns, Axon models may take a break and heal 1 VY. * Bearded Highlanders - Their northerly cousins, the Gaelites, have never seen eye to eye with the Axons civilized life-style. Highlanders take every defeat personally, every death, the death of a brother. Best not make them angry. Faction Summary Axony is a powerful group with a soldier for every occasion, and Experts moving about the field solving any problems beyond another soldier's scope. = The Kingdoms of Chugoku = Based on Three Kingdoms China Far to the east of the Mare-Civitas, and south of the snowy reaches of Eastern Vandalands, lies one of the largest kingdoms in the world, and it lies in ruins. With the constant assailing from their island neighbors, and the inept ruling of its aristocrats, Chugoku has found over a century of conflict within its own borders. As leaders and peasants alike choose sides, their ancient foe, the Shogunate of Ribenguo, plans to take advantage of the instability. Despite its problems, Chugoku still has the highest quality of living of any nation. Gardens and food a plenty, gluttony more-so. Every day magnificent statues of long-dead heroes are erected, alongside irrigation waterways and paved roads. Merchants and explorers from all corners of the globe travel to the city centers to discover medicines and sciences beyond their comprehension. Perhaps the most revolutionary being the explosive black powder, used around the world for firearms. Chugoku remains extremely rich, despite bleeding money in senseless war efforts. Faction Highlights Broken Kingdom - The once proud nation of Chugoku has been thrust into civil war. Four sub-factions now vie for control, and provide the player with several special rules for their selection. * Yellow Tail - The lower classes have revolted against their decadent leaders and sworn to a religious path. Yellow Tail soldiers fast weekly and cost 2 fewer FD than other troops. * Red Claw - Having stolen the Imperial Seal during a moment of crisis, the pirates of southern Chugoku stand behind its holder with pride, having a boost of +2 CM. * Blue Fang - The young emperor's caretaker has stood fast behind the throne, For years his forces have had a hand in every military action, and an eye on every foe. Blue Fang models may reroll any KE roll once per phase. * Green Eye - With his inept nephew under the thrall of a corrupt bureaucrat, the Green Eye leader calls for a return of the Han Dynasty to power, under his rule of course! Many of the people, not swayed by the Yellow Tail rebellion have flocked to his banner.3d10 + KE Civilians (1 VY, 0 in other stats) join his cause in battle. Faction Summary Chugoku a has large variety of Heroes, Exemplars, and Troops, but must select a sub-faction, changing their overall play style accordingly. = The Free Cities of Mare-Civitas = Based on Spanish Conquistadores Before the age of gunpowder, before the age of sail, the Holy Rodentian Empire spanned from the Mare Civitas north to the Axonian Channel, and far east to the mountains of Chugoku. In the days before the decline of the Corelingian Dynasty, Charles de Mange, King of the Shrews, refused to favor one son over another in their dispute for the throne. Instead, he split the kingdom amongst them. His eldest son, Lowther would follow in this fashion, splitting his own kingdom amongst his children. These lands, along the coast of the Mare Civitas, and the islands off the shore are now numerous independent city- states. Despite the many times these small countries squabble amongst themselves, their common lineage ties them together in times of strife. Today the Merchant mice thrive on trade and colonization with their armada of warships and merchant marine vessels, controlling the world's waterways. Their masterful weapons designs have protected them both from attacks by sea and by land, their island and coastal fortresses neigh impregnable. Allied with the Capybara of Vespuccia, the city-states stand unified against outside threats. Faction Highlights * Mercenari - The amassed fortunes of the merchantmice allows them to take more mercenaries than other factions. Additionally, they can spend food like gold to pay for these mercenaries. * Heavy Weapons - Chipmunk engineers have created devastating weapons feared by potential invaders. * Leaping Lancers - Though most troops of Civitas are lightly armored conscripts, the Mice Lancers are the pride of the Free Cities, striking from the sky. Faction Summary The Free Cities rely mostly on low cost, high count troops to protect their borders, however, their army selection is much more diverse with the choice to take more mercenaries than other factions. = The Shogunate of Ribenguo = Based on the Sengoku Period of Japan Long a mystery of the western world, Ribenguo is spoken of merely in tales and words of warning by Chugokan merchants traveling abroad. Each story contradicts another, described as marauding pirates by one teller, and as ancient mystics by another. Ribenguo stands today as an isolationist country, ruled by the longest continuing ruling line in history. The Tanuki Dynasty has lost its military power, however, to the Shoguns, expert generals with the skill and armies to keep other Samurai in line. The Samurai of Ribenguo have to contend with enemy spies and assassins when their leaders cannot find the focus to place their attention to their foreign borders. However, each generation of Shoguns, as their base of power crumbles, points to the Chugokans and other foreigners as the source of all problems in their territories. When the battle plans are set, the entire might of the Ribenguan army is brought to bare against their enemies. Their current foothold on the mainland has tipped the balance of power in favor of this ancient empire. Faction Highlights * The Seven Wanderers - A group of Exemplars that have become friends over a hundred battles. Unlike normal exemplars which join troop squads, the Wanderers join together as a squad, creating a horrible force that roves the field. * Shinobi - The foxes of Ribenguo have long trained in stealth and assassination techniques, troops should watch their backs when fighting this army. * Samurai - the Tanuki of Ribenguo have pledged their lives to honor their masters and their families, any of them would give their lives for victory. Faction Summary Ribenguo is a faction of elite warriors, most important of which are the Wanderers, each one with their own epic tale of battle. = The Scyzantine Empire = Based on the Ottoman Empire The great fortress of Agaminople, seated at the center of the ancient capital of Scyzantium, Lacerta, stands today as a testament to reptilian fortitude. Challenged both by invaders from the west, attempting to take the cradle of life from its rightful owners, and by imperialists from the east, beyond the mountains, the Scyzantines have fought foes on their own terms, on the dunes of their homeland. For centuries the Sultanate has guided the lizards, turtles, and other reptiles of the deserts with a unified fist. The current Sultan, Varanus the Lawmaker, has kept the most stable government of the Empire, even able to call upon the Zabarans and the Khonshans, in times of great need. His diplomatic skills have even brought the last of the Hassassins into the reptilian fold, working as messengers, scouts, and spies. Faction Highlights * Progeny of Alhazred - The scaly skin of all reptiles provide a +1 AR * Siege Tortoise - These massive creatures act as mobile war machines, breaking down walls and crushing foes. * Vizier's Guidance - The ministers of Scyzantium advise their lords both in government functions as well as in military tactics. Their abilities are extremely varied, providing a number of unique attacks. Faction Summary All troops of Scyzantium are incredibly tough, providing enough defense to slow down attackers and allowing their own heroes and war machines to destroy the invaders. = The Vandalands = Based on the Vandals of Germany From the north the barbaric hordes rode down upon the great Rodentian Empire, long steeped in corruption. With its fall came the dark age of the world, taking nearly a millennia to recover. By 1000 two new empires had risen, Scyzantium in the eastern deserts and the Holy Rodentian Empire in the west. The two fought over faith and territory for generations. Until the unified tribes and countries fell upon old ways, set against themselves. Though the Holy Rodentian Empire is now divided, the spirit of the Rat King, the leaders tailbound to protect their lands and each other, pervades the Vandalands, giving rise to the honorable barbarian. Faction Highlights * Heart of the Fatherland - A Vandalands army may convert Gold and/or Lumber to Food at a 1:1 Rate * Knightly Heritage - Elite troops of the Vandalands have steeds and count as cavalry. * Raiding Hordes - The low cost Vandal troops have multiple wounds, having a higher survival rate. Faction Summary Due to their 'sliding' food resources, Vandals can be an incredibly high count army, but still have troops tough enough to survive like high-cost models. = The Tribes of Zabar = Based on the Zulu people and Boers of South Africa: The mysterious jungles south of the 'civilized' world have long rejected colonization, but with the discovery of rich diamond and gold mines throughout the region, the many tribes must band together to fight foreign invaders. Hyena, Boars, and even Vandal settlers fend off the industrial machinations of the colonists from Axony, who bring more soldiers into the war every month. Becoming more outnumbered everyday, the tribes have turned to the great elephant chieftain Loxodon to lead them in a ferocious fight, and to once more show outsiders why they feared the dark jungles of Zabar for millennia. Faction Highlights * Highveld - Zabar models gain +1 WS and +1 AR while in cover. * Tribal Witch Doctors - The Hyenas of the jungles are experts in war medicines, providing power to their warriors and weakening their enemies. * Heroes of guerrilla warfare - The lioness huntresses and ivory chieftains of Zabar know just where to lay in wait and surprise their foes. Faction Summary Zabar relies heavily on their troops being in the right place with the right bonuses, and their heroes taking an active role in combat. With their powerful Ivory Chiefs, Zabar players have less risk of losing their generals to fighting troops.

Definitions.  Let X and Y be normed linear spaces, and denote by B(X,Y) the space of bounded operators of the form T:X\\\\to Y. Let A\\\\subseteq X be any subset. We say that T is bounded below on A whenever there is a constant c\\\\in(0,\\\\infty) such that for all x\\\\in A, the inequality \\\\Tx\\\\\\\\geq c\\\\x\\\\ holds. If A=X, we say simply that T is bounded below. Now suppose X and Y are Banach spaces, and let Id_X\\\\in B(X) and Id_Y\\\\in B(Y) denote the respective identity operators. An operator T\\\\in B(X,Y) is called inessential whenever Id_X-ST is a Fredholm operator for every S\\\\in B(Y,X). Equivalently, T is inessential if and only if Id_Y-TS is Fredholm for every S\\\\in B(Y,X). Denote by \\\\mathcal{E}(X,Y) the set of all inessential operators in B(X,Y). An operator T\\\\in B(X,Y) is called strictly singular whenever it fails to be bounded below on any infinite-dimensional subspace of X. Denote by \\\\mathcal{SS}(X,Y) the set of all strictly singular operators in B(X,Y). We say that T\\\\in B(X,Y) is finitely strictly singular whenever for each \\\\epsilon>0 there exists n\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N} such that for every subspace E of X satisfying \\\\text{dim}(E)\\\\geq n, there is x\\\\in E such that \\\\Tx\\\\<\\\\epsilon\\\\x\\\\. Denote by \\\\mathcal{FSS}(X,Y) the set of all finitely strictly singular operators in B(X,Y). Let B_X=\\\\\\\\{x\\\\in X:\\\\x\\\\\\\\leq 1\\\\\\\\} denote the closed unit ball in X. An operator T\\\\in B(X,Y) is compact whenever TB_X=\\\\\\\\{Tx:x\\\\in B_X\\\\\\\\} is a relatively norm-compact subset of Y, and denote by \\\\mathcal{K}(X,Y) the set of all such compact operators.  Properties.  Strictly singular operators can be viewed as a generalization of compact operators, as every compact operator is strictly singular. These two classes share some important properties. For example, if X is a Banach space and T is a strictly singular operator in B(X) then its spectrum \\\\sigma(T) satisfies the following properties: (i) the cardinality of \\\\sigma(T) is at most countable; (ii) 0\\\\in\\\\sigma(T) (except possibly in the trivial case where X is finite- dimensional); (iii) zero is the only possible limit point of \\\\sigma(T); and (iv) every nonzero \\\\lambda\\\\in\\\\sigma(T) is an eigenvalue. This same \\"spectral theorem\\" consisting of (i)-(iv) is satisfied for inessential operators in B(X). Classes \\\\mathcal{K}, \\\\mathcal{FSS}, \\\\mathcal{SS}, and \\\\mathcal{E} all form norm-closed operator ideals. This means, whenever X and Y are Banach spaces, the component spaces \\\\mathcal{K}(X,Y), \\\\mathcal{FSS}(X,Y), \\\\mathcal{SS}(X,Y), and \\\\mathcal{E}(X,Y) are each closed subspaces (in the operator norm) of B(X,Y), such that the classes are invariant under composition with arbitrary bounded linear operators. In general, we have \\\\mathcal{K}(X,Y)\\\\subset\\\\mathcal{FSS}(X,Y)\\\\subset\\\\mathcal{SS}(X,Y)\\\\subset\\\\mathcal{E}(X,Y), and each of the inclusions may or may not be strict, depending on the choices of X and Y. = Examples. = Every bounded linear map T:\\\\ell_p\\\\to \\\\ell_q, for 1\\\\le q, p < \\\\infty, p e q, is strictly singular. Here, \\\\ell_p and \\\\ell_q are sequence spaces. Similarly, every bounded linear map T:c_0\\\\to\\\\ell_p and T:\\\\ell_p\\\\to c_0, for 1\\\\le p < \\\\infty, is strictly singular. Here c_0 is the Banach space of sequences converging to zero. This is a corollary of Pitt's theorem, which states that such T, for q < p, are compact. If 1\\\\leq p then the formal identity operator I_{p,q}\\\\in B(\\\\ell_p,\\\\ell_q) is finitely strictly singular but not compact. If 1 then there exist \\"Pelczynski operators\\" in B(\\\\ell_p,\\\\ell_q) which are uniformly bounded below on copies of \\\\ell_2^n, n\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}, and hence are strictly singular but not finitely strictly singular. In this case we have \\\\mathcal{K}(\\\\ell_p,\\\\ell_q)\\\\subsetneq\\\\mathcal{FSS}(\\\\ell_p,\\\\ell_q)\\\\subsetneq\\\\mathcal{SS}(\\\\ell_p,\\\\ell_q). However, every inessential operator with codomain \\\\ell_q is strictly singular, so that \\\\mathcal{SS}(\\\\ell_p,\\\\ell_q)=\\\\mathcal{E}(\\\\ell_p,\\\\ell_q). On the other hand, if X is any separable Banach space then there exists a bounded below operator T\\\\in B(X,\\\\ell_\\\\infty) any of which is inessential but not strictly singular. Thus, in particular, \\\\mathcal{K}(\\\\ell_p,\\\\ell_\\\\infty)\\\\subsetneq\\\\mathcal{FSS}(\\\\ell_p,\\\\ell_\\\\infty)\\\\subsetneq\\\\mathcal{SS}(\\\\ell_p,\\\\ell_\\\\infty)\\\\subsetneq\\\\mathcal{E}(\\\\ell_p,\\\\ell_\\\\infty) for all 1. = Duality. = The compact operators form a symmetric ideal, which means T\\\\in\\\\mathcal{K}(X,Y) if and only if T^*\\\\in\\\\mathcal{K}(Y^*,X^*). However, this is not the case for classes \\\\mathcal{FSS}, \\\\mathcal{SS}, or \\\\mathcal{E}. To establish duality relations, we will introduce additional classes. If Z is a closed subspace of a Banach space Y then there exists a \\"canonical\\" surjection Q_Z:Y\\\\to Y/Z defined via the natural mapping y\\\\mapsto y+Z. An operator T\\\\in B(X,Y) is called strictly cosingular whenever given an infinite-dimensional closed subspace Z of Y, the map Q_ZT fails to be surjective. Denote by \\\\mathcal{SCS}(X,Y) the subspace of strictly cosingular operators in B(X,Y). Theorem 1. Let X and Y be Banach spaces, and let T\\\\in B(X,Y). If T* is strictly singular (resp. strictly cosingular) then T is strictly cosingular (resp. strictly singular). Note that there are examples of strictly singular operators whose adjoints are neither strictly singular nor strictly cosingular (see Plichko, 2004). Similarly, there are strictly cosingular operators whose adjoints are not strictly singular, e.g. the inclusion map I:c_0\\\\to\\\\ell_\\\\infty. So \\\\mathcal{SS} is not in full duality with \\\\mathcal{SCS}. Theorem 2. Let X and Y be Banach spaces, and let T\\\\in B(X,Y). If T* is inessential then so is T.

Ciarraige √ìic Bethra were located in what was then the kingdom of Aidhne (now south County Galway), where they were one of the three peoples living in Aidhne prior to the arrival of the U√≠ Fiachrach in the 6th century. Ciarraige A√≠, Ciarraige Airtig and Ciarraighe Locha na n√Åirne, were located further north, adjacent to each other along the east County Mayo/west-central County Roscommon area.

Their settlement in contiguity to such a significant royal site must surely bespeak their possessing a considerable status at some stage just over the historical horizon. They first appear in the annals towards the close of the eighth century when, in 796, the Annals of Ulster record the death of Duinechaid ua Daire, whom it describes as 'dux Ciarraide'; this is expanded by the Four Masters to 'tighearna Ciarraighe A√≠' and the latter also tells of the death in the same year of Fogartach mac Cathail who is termed 'tighearna Maighe A√≠' ...

In 1938, jazz bandleader and singer Cab Calloway published the first dictionary by an African-American, Cab Calloway's Cat-ologue: A \\"Hepster's\\" Dictionary, which became the official jive language reference book of the New York Public Library. In 1939, Calloway published an accompanying book titled Professor Cab Calloway‚Äôs Swingformation Bureau, which instructed readers how to apply the words and phrases from the dictionary. He released several editions until 1944, the last being The New Cab Calloway‚Äôs Hepsters Dictionary: Language of Jive. Poet Lemn Sissay observed that \\"Cab Calloway was taking ownership of language for a people who, just a few generations before, had their own languages taken away.\\" H. L. Mencken in The American Language however defined jive as \\"an amalgam of Negro-slang from Harlem and the argots of drug addicts and the pettier sort of criminals, with occasional additions from the Broadway gossip columns and the high school campus\\". Dan Burley's book Original Handbook of Harlem Jive was compiled and published in 1944 at the suggestion of Harlem poet Langston Hughes. In 1953, Albert Lavada Durst published the Jives of Dr. Hep Cat, a collection of rhymes compiled when he was at WVET in Austin, where he did late night R&B.; Besides referring to the music scene, much of the argot related to drugs, such as marijuana. Mezz Mezzrow gave this sample:  Glossary  ;A hummer :Exceptionally good. ;Alligator :A devotee of jazz or swing music. Perhaps alludes to sharp-dressing with alligator leather. ;Beat up :Sad, uncomplimentary, tired. ; Chops:Refers to any musician's level of ability. Originates from the physical changes that occur in a brass player's mouth and lips. E.g., Dizzy Gillespie and Louis Armstrong. Also a term used for a musician who had significantly improved his or her playing. E.g., \\"I got my chops up\\" or \\"Has he got the chops to play with this group?\\". Chops can also refer to general ability in any skill. E.g., \\"Yo, I found a lawyer who has the chops to get George Shearing a driver's license!\\" ;Corny :Old-fashioned, stale. ; Frail:Abbreviation of \\"frail sister\\" (prostitute). Also used for any hepster woman. ;G-man:Government man, especially one who arrests or harasses peaceful citizens. ; Gage:Marijuana. Particularly associated with Louis Armstrong. ; Gate:Any man, usually used as a greeting. \\"Yo, gate, what's the word from the herd?\\" ; Gatemouth:A horn player who has a large mouth or a mouth that is habitually open. Playing brass instruments often results in larger cheeks and a callus on the player's lip. The larger cheeks is the origin of the word \\"chops\\". After 1930, however, \\"Gatemouth\\" generally referred only to Louis Armstrong. ; Hep:In the know. Later, hip. ;Hep cat:Knowledgeable person. Later, hipster. ;High:Happy. See \\"mellow\\". ; Hoochie Coocher:Hot babe who dances lying down. \\"Minnie the Moocher was a red hot HOOCHIE COOCHER.\\" ‚ÄîCab Calloway ;Hoochie coochie:Erotic dance. ; Jeff:Opposite of hep; unhip, uncool or opposed to hipness. ; Jelly roll:1) female genitalia, 2) act of coitus. 3) Jelly Roll Morton: a famous stride piano player. ;Jitterbug: A swing fan, named after the dance. Same as the Lindy Hop, a dance created in the 1920s and 1930s. Danced to swing and Western swing. ; Jive:Cab Calloway defines this in the 1930s as \\"Harlemese speech\\", meaning the style of slang. In basic terms jive means talk. It can also mean kidding with someone. It is often confused with jibe which means \\"be in accordance with\\". ;Jive talk:\\"Whaddya say, gate? Are you in the know, or are you a solid bringer- downer?\\" ‚ÄîCab Calloway. \\"Are you Hep to the Jive\\" ‚ÄîCab Calloway. ;Joint is jumping :The place is lively, the club is leaping with fun. ; Light up:To light a stick of T or reefer. ; Lid:A Prince Albert tobacco can filled to the lid. Roughly one ounce. ; Man!:Commonly used as an interjection or for emphasis. Also in alternative to \\"boy\\" which was used by whites as a disparaging term used to hail African-American adult males. ; Mellow:\\"Let's all get mellow.\\" Words in the song \\"Light Up\\". The meaning is obscure. Probably means light-hearted, calm and happy. ; Mighty Mezz:An expertly rolled reefer. Named after Milton Mezz Mezzrow, the saxophonist who played with Louis Armstrong. Mezzrow was a close friend of Louis Armstrong. He was also a user of marijuana and a distributor strictly to other musicians who were his friends. ; Mop:A woman. Often a reference to another hepster's girlfriend. ; Muggles:1930s and '40s slang for marijuana cigarettes. ; Mugglin':I's a-mugglin', you's a-mugglin', meaning getting high on reefer. ;Ofay:Policeman or law enforcement, \\"the Man\\", possibly constructed from pig Latin. ;Pad:Bed. ; Pot:Marijuana. ; Puff:To smoke weed. ; Reefer:The marijuana plant, aka hemp, pot, ganja, or cannabis. Refers to the leaf of the plant or a cigarette rolled from the plant (JIVE, STICK OF TEA). See also: Reefer Madness, a 1936 anti- cannabis propaganda film. ; Reefer man:Someone who uses reefer. ; Stick of tea:Joint, reefer, left-handed cigarette. ; Stuff:1) Jive, muggles, reefer. 2) Nickname for famous viper, jazz fiddler, \\"Stuff\\" Smith, famous composer of viper songs such as \\"If You're a Viper\\". ; \\"T\\" or Tea:Marijuana. ;Teapad:in Harlem in the 1930s and 40s, an after-hours club where pot was smoked and jazz music performed. ; T-man (Tea-man):Marijuana provider. ; Vipers:Refers to hep cats from the 1930s who inhaled. Examples include Cab Calloway, Fats Waller, Ella Fitzgerald, Nat King Cole, Billie Holiday, Louis Armstrong, Benny Goodman, and Louis Jordan. They frequented tea pads and smoked gage. The term vipers arose from the sssssst sound made by an inhaling pot-smoker or a snake. ;Zoot suit:Named in the rhyming way of jive talk: \\"a Zoot Suit with a reet pleat, with a drape shape\\". With a generous cut but tight cuffs, this was popular with dancers of the swing era.

They were posthumously published in December 1791 by Artaria as Op. 18, only a few weeks after Mozart's death. Although not considered on a par with the earlier, more famous 'Haydn Quartets' (K. 387, 421, 428, 458, 464, 465), these pieces are noted for their beauty, equilibrium amongst the instruments and the exceptional prominence and cantabile nature of the cello part (the instrument played by the king himself). These are also the only pieces in this genre that Mozart composed 'to order', i.e. as a commission from a royal patron. The Quartets *String Quartet No. 21 in D major, K. 575, op. 18 no. 1 (1789) *String Quartet No. 22 in B flat major, K. 589, op. 18 no. 2 (1790) *String Quartet No. 23 in F major, K. 590, op. 18 no. 3 (1790) Due to the prominence of the cello part these quartets came to be known as 'Concertante Quartets'. Historical background While Mozart was composing these quartets he was also working on a set of sonatas for the King's daughter, Princess Friederike (K. 576 was the only one completed). He was paid 100 Friedrichsd‚Äôor for his work. But thereafter Mozart received no more of his promised fees. In effect Mozart withheld the dedication and engraved the piece at his own expense as he wrote in a letter to his friend and fellow freemason Michael von Puchberg: \\"‚Ä¶I am meanwhile composing‚Ä¶six quartets for the King, all of which Kozeluch is going to engrave at my expense.\\"Letter to Michael von Puchberg, 13 July 1789 Mozart never dedicated the pieces to the Prussian King, so the title of these quartets has originated from his private 'thematic catalogue' of his own work (which he was keeping at the time). He entered them as A quartet for 2 violins, viola, and cello, for his Majesty the King of Prussia. Critical reception The quartets were enthusiastically received. For instance the Wiener Zeitung announced the publication of the quartets as follows: :From Artaria Comp., art dealers in the Kohlmarkt are to be had: Three entirely new concertante quartets for two violins, viola and violoncello by Hr. Kapellmeister Mozart Op 18. These quartets are one of the estimable works of the composer Mozart, who was torn untimely from this world; they flowed from the pen of this so great musical genius not long before his death, and they display all that musical interest in respect of Art, Beauty, and Taste, which must awaken pleasure and admiration not only in the amateur but the true connoisseur also.Wiener Zeitung, 28 December 1791 Notes References *Einstein, Alfred: Mozart: His Character and works *Solomon, Maynard: Mozart: A Life *Nohl, Ludwig: (compiler), Wallace, Lady Grace (translator): The Letters of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart *Holmes, Edward.

Origins The Ciarraige Airtech were one of three branches of the Ciarraige located close to each other in central Connacht. They were the Ciarraige A√≠, Ciarraige Airtig and Ciarraighe Locha na n√Åirne, along the east County Mayo/west-central County Roscommon area. They were thought to have once formed a single over-kingdom which was broken up by the rise of the U√≠ Bri√∫in in the 8th and 9th centuries. In 2000, Nollaig √ì Mura√≠le wrote of them as follows (p.168): \\"The most obscure of the (supposed) three branches of Ciarraige Connacht were those of Airtech who are mentioned in the Patrician documents, in the Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn, in the saints' genealogies, and, for the last time, in the early-fourteenth-century annals. Their territory - variously referred to as Cr√≠ch Airtig and Mag nAirtig - was centred on the parish of Tibohine, baony of Frenchpark (around the present village of Loughglynn), but covered parts of adjacent parishes (including Castlemmore, Kilcolman and Kilnamanagh) in north-west roscommon. Overall, their impact on Connacht history must be adjudged very slight.\\" Annalistic references * 1315 - As for Maelruanaid Mac Diarmata, when he heard that Diarmait Gall had established himself in the seat of dignity of his own family and on the Rock of Loch Key, and that he had been sent to be made king at Cruachan, and when his own cows had been slaughtered in Glenn Fathraim, he marched with his household troops and retainers to the Callow of the Rock and, turning his back to the Shannon, he plundered from that river to Cara, where the eraghts of the Three Ciarraige were assembled with their flocks and herds, namely the Western Ciarraige, the Ciarraige of Mag nAi and the Ciarraige of Airtech; and it is not likely that there was made in that age a fiercer or a more booty-getting attack than this raid.

Adjacent stations History The private Kitakyushu Railway had opened a line between and on 5 December 1923. By 1924, the line had been extended westwards to . The line was extended again with Higashi-Karatsu opening on the east bank of the Matsuura River as the new western terminus on 15 June 1925. On 20 June 1929, the track was extended south down the east bank of the Matsuura River towards . Trains at Higashi- Karatsu executed a switchback before proceeding either south to Yamamoto or east to Nijinomatsubara. When the Kitakyushu Railway was nationalized on 1 October 1937, Japanese Government Railways (JGR) took over control of the station. The line which served the station was designated the Chikuhi Line. The location of Higashi-Karatsu was inconvenient as the city centre of Karatsu lay on the west bank of the Matsuura River. Passengers wanting to access station in the city centre had to travel a long dog-leg south via Yamamoto or make a road or foot journey across the river. In 1983, the station was moved, opening at a new location to the southeast on 22 March. A through-track was established across the Matsuura River via to . The stretch of track down the east bank to Yamamoto with the intermediate stations of Kagami and Kuri was closed. Along with this change of route, the track from through Higashi- Karatsu to Karatsu was electrified. See for photographic coverage of the old station. With the privatization of Japanese National Railways (JNR), the successor of JGR, on 1 April 1987, control of the station passed to JR Kyushu. Passenger statistics In fiscal 2016, the station was used by an average of 823 passengers daily (boarding passengers only), and it ranked 188th among the busiest stations of JR Kyushu.
