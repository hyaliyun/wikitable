The Mangarla people traditionally lived in the north-western area of the Great Sandy Desert, west of the Karajarri people, east of the Walmajarri, with the Juwaliny and Yulparija to the south. Many Mangarla people now live in Jarlmadangah and Bidyadanga. Mangarla language The Mangarla language is one of the Marrngu languages of the Pama‚ÄìNyungan family. Two dialect varieties of their tongue are attested, Kakutu/Kakurtu and Ngulatu/Ngulartu. Mangarla is an endangered language, with less than 20 native speakers according to a 2002 census. The Pallottine Catholic priest Father Kevin McKelson (1926‚Äì2011), known to the 5 tribes whose languages he mastered as Japulu (father) compiled the first dictionary of the language in 1998, a work which formed the basis for a dictionary co-authored with Albert Burgman in 2005. History of contact The Mangarla, like the Walmajarri, Wangkatjungka and Nyigina. were bundled together by the early white colonizers as a \\"desert mob\\" because of the arid territory they lived in. Starting from around 1885, when pastoralists began to use their territory for grazing stock, many men from the Mangarla tribe were rounded up to work as jackaroos, in exchange for an annual pay of, according to native tradition, a pair of boots, a shirt and trousers., a situation that descendants say persisted until the 1967 referendum and constitutional amendment by the Holt Government established the principle of equal pay, after which many lost their jobs. Native title In 2014, in a decision handed down by Justice John Gilmour of the Federal Court of Australia, the Nyikina-Mangarla people were granted native title to 26,000 square kilometres of territory extending from the King Sound through the Fitzoy Valley to the Great Sandy Desert.

The model is of historic significance as the first scientific publication in which Einstein embraced the possibility of a cosmos of time-varying radius. Description Interpreting Edwin Hubble's discovery of a linear relation between the redshifts of the galaxies and their radial distance as evidence for an expanding universe, Einstein abandoned his earlier static model of the universe and embraced the dynamic cosmology of Alexander Friedmann. Removing the cosmological constant term from the Friedmann equations on the grounds that it was both unsatisfactory and unnecessary, Einstein arrived at a model of a universe that expands and then contracts, a model that was later denoted the Friedmann‚ÄìEinstein model of the universe. In the model, Einstein derived simple expressions relating the density of matter, the radius of the universe and the timespan of the expansion to the Hubble constant. With the use of the contemporaneous value of 500 km¬∑s‚àí1Mpc‚àí1 for the Hubble constant, he calculated values of 10‚àí26 cm‚àí3, 108 light-years and 1010 years for the density of matter, the radius of the universe and the timespan of the expansion respectively. It has recently been shown that these calculations contain a slight systematic error. Einstein's blackboard In May 1931, Einstein chose the Friedmann‚ÄìEinstein universe as the topic of his 2nd Rhodes lecture at Oxford University. A blackboard used by Einstein during the lecture, now known as Einstein's Blackboard, has been preserved at the Museum of the History of Science, Oxford.

It was created in 1872 and lasted until Partition in 1921‚Äì22. History The Board was created under the Local Government Board (Ireland) Act 1872, mirroring the Local Government Board created for England and Wales in 1871. Upon its establishment, the Board took over the functions of the Irish Poor Law Commissioners with respect to Boards of Guardians of Poor Law Unions, and also dealt with urban municipal government (town commissioners and borough corporations). Its headquarters were in the Custom House, Dublin. There were five Board members: two political ex-officio members, the Chief Secretary for Ireland (who was President) and the Under-Secretary for Ireland; and three permanent technocratic members, including the Vice-President and the medical commissioner (a qualified physician for addressing public health issues).Local Government Board (Ireland) Act, 1872, sec.2 The first three permanent members were the three final Poor Law Commissioners. Generally the Vice-President was in effective charge with the political members absent; but in Arthur Balfour's presidency there were tensions.Crossman 2006, pp.16‚Äì17 Dublin Castle tried to maintain a balance of Catholic and Protestant Board members.Crossman 2006, p.18 The Congested Districts Board for Ireland was set up separately in 1891 to deal specifically with areas with large numbers of small uneconomic farms. After the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898, the Local Government Board dealt with the new county and district councils, including the initial recommendations for county boundary adjustments under the 1898 act. Many local councils were nationalist-controlled and these frequently resented the Board, regarding it as bureaucratic and imperialist. Supersession County and district councils controlled by Sinn F√©in after the 1920 local elections bypassed the Local Government Board in favour of the self-proclaimed Irish Republic's Department of Local Government, with W. T. Cosgrave as Minister. On 25 May 1921, near the end of the Republic's guerrilla war, the Custom House was burned out by Dublin Brigade of the Irish Republican Army, destroying most of the Board's records. After Partition, in Northern Ireland the Board's functions passed to the Department of Home Affairs in 1921 and the Department of Health and Local Government on its creation in 1944. In the Irish Free State the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924 formally transferred the Board's functions to the Department of Local Government and Public Health, whose successor, the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, is still based in the Custom House.

Early life Jessica Blain grew up in Champlain, New York, where she lived on a dairy farm with her parents, Sam and Allisn, and her three older sisters. For high school, she attended Northeast Clinton Central School in Champlain and served as co-chair of the student council. College Following her high school graduation in 1997, Blain enrolled at SUNY Plattsburgh (Plattsburgh State), where she also worked as a teaching assistant and was a member of Phi Kappa Phi (Œ¶ŒöŒ¶). In 2002, she graduated cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in Speech Communication. Then she enrolled at Albany Law School, where she completed her Juris Doctor in three years. While at Albany Law, she served as senior editor of the Government, Law and Policy Journal. She also served as the executive editor at the Center for Judicial Process, which was run by her law professor, Vincent Martin Bonventre. In 2007, two years after she completed her law degree, an article which she and Bonventre had co-written in law school was published in the Albany Law Review. By the time the article was written, she had married and was going professionally by the name Jessica Blain-Lewis. Career Prior to graduating law school, Lewis secured an internship as a law clerk at the Albany County District Attorney's Office, under D.A. David Soares. Upon graduation, she was hired full time as an assistant D.A. She was officially admitted to the New York State Bar in 2006. Throughout her career, most of her cases have involved drug offenses, robberies, assaults, and elder abuse. One of her cases even involved an immigrant who had been tricked into a phony green card marriage with the promise of gaining citizenship privileges. Soon after this case, Lewis also prosecuted her first homicide. In December 2016, she was named the Albany County Street Crimes Unit's Bureau Chief. Survivor In 2016, Lewis was cast on the reality competition show Survivor: Millennials vs. Gen X. Having been born in 1979, she was initially placed on the Takali tribe, along with the other members of Generation X. On Day One, when all the castaways were scrambling to grab as many supplies and food items as possible for the journey, Lewis discovered an envelope, picked it up, and upon opening it, realized that she had just claimed the \\"Legacy Advantage,\\" the benefits of which would be revealed on Day 36. If she were to be eliminated before then, she would be required to bequeath the advantage to another player still in the game. On Day Ten, Lewis orchestrated the blindside of Paul Wachter, after he said that he would rather align with the men over the women in the tribe. This immediately made her a target for the next Tribal Council. But when the vote took place two days later, David Wright played his immunity idol on Lewis, thus negating the five votes against her and sparing her in the game. Lucy Huang, with just two votes, was eliminated instead. Lewis immediately aligned with Wright, as well as Ken McNickle, after that Tribal Council. The next day, during the tribal split and reshuffle, she and McNickle remained on Takali, but Wright was sent to Vanua, the former millennial tribe. When the merge happened on Day 21, the three of them were reunited. By Day 28, Lewis was once again targeted by her old Gen X tribemate Chris Hammons and his alliance, and at that night's Tribal Council, she indeed received four votes, but Hammons was sent out of the game with seven votes. Two days later, after Justin \\"Jay\\" Starrett won immunity, former Millennial member Hannah Shapiro convinced Lewis, McNickle, and Wright to join her and Adam Klein in targeting Zeke Smith. To ensure that this plan would go off without a hitch, Wright contemplated playing his new idol on Shapiro. But at Tribal Council, former Gen X member Sunday Burquest convinced Wright that Smith's alliance was now planning on voting out McNickle instead. Wright played his idol on McNickle, who, as it turned out, received zero votes. The vote ended up tied 5‚Äì5 between Smith and Shapiro. Before the revote, Smith tried to get Lewis to flip on Shapiro in order to avoid having to draw rocks to decide who leaves the game. Lewis refused, and the revote remained deadlocked. After much discussion, there was no consensus as to whether Smith or Shapiro should be the one voted out, so per the rules of the game, Smith, Shapiro, and any other immune castaway would be safe, while the rest had to randomly draw rocks to determine the elimination. In total, six castaways would have to draw from among five white rocks and one black rock; whoever drew the black rock would be out of the game. When the rocks were drawn and then revealed, Lewis had the black one, thus sending her out of the game at tenth place, as the fourth member of the jury. After her torch was snuffed, Lewis willed the Legacy Advantage to her ally McNickle, who would get to use it as an immunity idol on Day 36. McNickle would eventually make it to the finals, but despite this, Lewis would cast her vote for Klein to win the title of Sole Survivor. On the September 25th, 2017, it was announced that Lewis would be joining the cast of Rob Has a Podcast alongside David Bloomberg, to replace fellow Survivor alumnus Rob Cesternino as co-host of the segment \\"Why _____ Lost,\\" starting with Survivor's 35th season, Survivor: Heroes vs. Healers vs. Hustlers.

In his college days, he played football for the University of Oklahoma. Early life Hammons was born April 1, 1978, and grew up in Sulphur, Oklahoma. He and his family later moved to Wilburton, where they lived in a trailer without running water. In 1995, his father Billy Lowell Hammons was arrested in Arkansas on drug possession charges and, after pleading no contest, was subsequently sentenced to serve up to 40 years in prison. Chris Hammons would move back to Sulphur, where he played football and basketball at Sulphur High School. College years In 1996, Hammons earned a scholarship to play football at East Central University (ECU) in Ada, Oklahoma. After only one year at ECU, he left the program and joined the football team at the University of Oklahoma (OU), as a walk-on. He was redshirted his first year at OU, but the following year, he finally saw some playing time with the Sooners, playing both tight end and special teams. After the 1998 season, OU head coach John Blake was fired, and was replaced by Bob Stoops, who awarded Hammons a full scholarship after becoming impressed by the redshirt walk-on's leadership abilities. In 1999, Hammons scored his only touchdown with OU, off a pass from Josh Heupel in a game against Baylor. The Sooners went on to win that game, 41-10. Hammons also led his team in receptions that day, and after the game, he was awarded the game ball for his efforts. In his senior year, injuries limited his playing time, and he was relegated to playing special teams only, though he would be named one of the Sooners' team captains for the 2000 season. That year, Oklahoma finished the regular season undefeated, won the Big 12 title, and was invited to play Florida State in the Orange Bowl on January 3, 2001, for the national championship. At the start of the game, Hammons and the other team captains met at midfield for the opening coin toss. With the television cameras pointed right at him, he gave a shout-out to his incarcerated father by screaming, \\"What's up, dad?\\" Oklahoma would go on to win the Orange Bowl to claim the national championship for OU. Career and family Hammons graduated Oklahoma in 2001 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history, and would later attend law school and earn his Juris Doctorate. His first job as a lawyer was with the firm of Foshee & Yaffe in Oklahoma City. His first case as an attorney had him defending a client who had been charged with a double felony. The trial resulted in an acquittal. In 2005, Hammons was at the law office one day when he met a young physical therapy student named Jennifer Prochaska. The two of them would soon marry, and together they would bear two sons, Costner and Jacks. Hammons' father-in-law Gary was also an attorney at F&Y; at the time that Hammons and his future wife met. Hammons' father, Billy Lowell, was released from prison after serving more than 11 years of his sentence. Billy Lowell Hammons died in 2014, at the age of 60. In 2009, Hammons partnered with associate Jeff Laird, as well as Laird's son, to start their own OKC law firm, Laird Hammons Laird. Hammons' father-in-law would join them at LHL the following year. Survivor Hammons is a huge fan of the television series Survivor. Having watched it since its premiere in 2000, he eventually decided to apply to be on the show. After several applications, he finally got the call to be on the program. Hammons was selected to be in the cast of Survivor: Millennials vs. Gen X, the series' 33rd season overall, which aired in 2016. At the start of the game, Hammons, who was born in 1978, was assigned to the Takali tribe, along with other members of Generation X. During the reward challenge on Day 11, he made a huge defensive move in the water by restraining opponents Justin \\"Jay\\" Starrett and Adam Klein simultaneously, allowing teammate David Wright to swim to the goal and score a point for Takali. Hammons himself would go on to score the winning point for his tribe, to win the reward challenge. On Day 13, a tribal reshuffle took place, and Hammons was switched to Vanua, formerly the tribe consisting entirely of millennials. There, he formed a bond with new tribemate Zeke Smith, who also happened to originally come from Oklahoma. Following the merge on Day 21, Hammons reunited with fellow Gen X-ers Bret Labelle and Sunday Burquest, who were separated from Hammons after being sent to Ikabula, a brand new tribe formed at the Day 13 tribal reshuffle. Before Tribal Council on Night 23, it was Hammons who suggested that his alliance vote out millennial Michelle Schubert, as she was perceived as being unlikely to possess, and play, a hidden immunity idol. Schubert was indeed voted out that night. By Day 26, Hammons had become a target for elimination, by rival and former Takali tribe-mate Wright. On Day 28, Hammons tried to convince the millennials to join him, Burquest, and Labelle in voting against Jessica Lewis, whom Hammons had been targeting for quite some time. At Tribal Council on Night 28, only Starrett voted with Hammons' alliance; the remaining millennials voted with Wright and his allies. By a vote of 7‚Äì4, Hammons was sent out of the game at 11th place, making him the third member of the jury. After leaving the Tribal Council area, he realized that his ally Smith was among those who had turned against him. At the Final Tribal Council, Hammons praised Klein for having the gumption to convince fellow finalist Ken McNickle to flip on Wright at the Final Four‚Äîalthough McNickle would claim that it was his decision alone to vote out Wright. Hammons went on to lobby the jury to vote for Klein to be the game's winner. In the end, the entire jury, including Hammons, voted to give Klein the title of Sole Survivor, over finalists Hannah Shapiro and McNickle. The Amazing Race Hammons competed in Season 31 of The Amazing Race, which featured past players from CBS reality shows Survivor and Big Brother, as well as teams from previous seasons of The Amazing Race. Hammons was teamed up with Survivor 33 alumni and friend Bret Labelle. Hammons and Labelle were eliminated in sixth place.

Serving over 1,600 individuals annually, URI currently operates six domestic violence shelters, with over 600 beds, as well as three permanent residences for adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. In addition, the organization operates programs and services to empower survivors of domestic violence and provide them with therapy and legal assistance. URI also provides support services for homeless families in 2 city-run shelters. History Urban Resource Institute was founded in 1980 as an affiliate of the Addiction Research and Treatment Corporation and expanded into domestic violence services in 1984. In 1985, the organization established the Urban Center for the Developmentally Disabled. Urban Resource Institute continued to expand its services for individuals struggling with addiction, with the founding of its Marguerite T. Saunders Urban Center for Alcoholism and Addiction Services in 1988. In 1990, URI opened two permanent residencies for adults with developmental disabilities. Through the 1990s and 2000s, URI continued to bolster its services catered toward survivors of domestic violence and adults with developmental disabilities. Nathaniel M. Fields has been the President and CEO of Urban Resource Institute since 2012, when the organization split from its affiliate and became independent. URIPALS Urban Resource Institute launched its URIPALS (People and Animals Living Safely) program in May 2013. URIPALS is the first program in New York and one of few in the United States that allows domestic violence survivors to live in a shelter apartment with their pets. Through URIPALS, survivors live in pet- friendly apartments and have access to private dog parks so they can play with their pets outside without encountering their abusers. In 2015, URI published a report on the connection between domestic violence and pet ownership that drew from two years of data collected from the URIPALS program. Economic empowerment Urban Resource Institute (URI) has several economic empowerment programs aimed at helping domestic violence survivors become self-sufficient and recover from economic abuse. A key element of URI‚Äôs economic empowerment program is the Working Internship Network (WIN). Since 1998, WIN has successfully provided URI residents with valuable job training and internship opportunities in a variety of work settings. The program also provides residents with job-skill development services, including career-readiness and financial literacy workshops. Additionally, WIN includes career counseling, vocational and psychosocial assessments, job-readiness training, and resume- preparation assistance to help survivors of domestic violence secure the education and skills necessary to begin achieving financial freedom. Legal education and advocacy program URI‚Äôs Domestic Violence Legal Education and Advocacy Program (LEAP) provides specialized, on-site legal services to the residents of the agency‚Äôs six domestic violence shelters. LEAP served 111 shelter residents in 2015. LEAP provides legal advice, referrals, and assistance on family law issues, including custody, visitation, orders of protection, child support, and divorce. LEAP also advocates on behalf of clients with the local police precincts and district attorneys‚Äô offices. Homelessness programs URI has been operating homeless shelters since 2016 and currently has shelters in Harlem and Queens. The Harlem Family Residence operates as a Tier II facility, providing 32 families with transitional housing and access to support services. The program for homeless families in Queens provides safe, temporary, emergency shelter and supportive services to 56 homeless families with children. Developmentally Disabled URI‚Äôs Urban Center for the Developmentally Disabled (UCDD) provides one-on-one job counseling, training, placement, and job-site coaching services for individuals diagnosed with intellectual and developmental disabilities. UCDD serves individuals who have ‚Äúaged out‚Äù of special education and provides transitional and supported employment opportunities and resources for adult students. Urban Resource Institute also manages two residential care facilities for individuals diagnosed with intellectual and developmental disabilities in Queens. Abusive Partner Intervention Program (APIP) The Abusive Partner Intervention Program is URI‚Äôs most recently created program. It integrates a trauma-informed approach with batterer intervention services aimed at decreasing recidivism. URI works with Westchester County Department of Probation, Westchester Jewish Community Services, and other agencies and organizations, to develop more trauma-informed offender services in New York State. Additionally, the APIP works closely with the local Integrated Domestic Violence Court to ensure offender accountability. Individuals attend the APIP program for 65 weeks, with an at-home assignment and group session presentation each week.

Educated by Sampson County public schools and Shaw University, Moore later became an assistant principal at the Normal School at Plymouth, until he built and became principal of what is now known as the Elizabeth City State University. Moore fought strongly against the segregation of education and society as well as for equality among whites and blacks. Throughout his life, Moore contributed greatly to the achievements of the North Carolina Teachers' Association and held every role within the organization.  Early life  Moore grew up in Duplin County, North Carolina. Born to two slave parents, he had a tumultuous childhood. His father is believed to have been killed by the Ku Klux Klan, so his mother was forced to raise him and his four siblings alone. Moore's mother believed that her children should all be educated and saw to it that Moore went to school during his upbringing. He was said to have gone to a neighborhood school created by the Freedmen's Bureau. He went on to study at the Philosophian Academy in a neighboring county, where he was able to develop his academic interests. After graduation, Moore became certified to teach in a one-room school, allowing him to further pursue his passion for academia. Adulthood = Education = Moore was recognized by his peers as a man of dignity, who was well-informed of current events. He received an A.B. degree in 1887 from Shaw University. Shaw also awarded him both M.A. and LL.D. degrees in recognition of his many contributions to education in the state. Moore's career began when he started teaching in the Holly Grove district at age 20. He saved the money earned from teaching and raising cotton to supplement his education at Shaw University. =Career= Post-graduation, Peter Moore began teaching again for a year before he was given the position of assistant principal at the State Normal School in Plymouth, North Carolina. In 1891, four years after beginning in Plymouth, Moore was asked to be the new leader of the State Colored Normal School at Elizabeth City. After the school opened, it split into three separate schools: Elizabeth City State, Fayetteville State, and Winston Salem State Normal Schools. Moore served as the principal until 1928 when he retired, just six years before his death. Legacy Despite his declining health, Moore continued to teach classroom management in his retirement. In 1928 he was granted the title of President Emeritus by Elizabeth State University. This position included a home and salary for the remainder of his life. Moore is credited as the reason that relations between whites and African Americans were so positive in Elizabeth City.

Originally trained in France, he did not race as a juvenile and won one minor race from six attempts as a three-year-old in 2006. He was then sold to race in England where he won three small handicap races in 2008 and the Great St. Wilfrid Stakes in the following year. After being transferred to the stable of Henry Candy he belatedly emerged as a top-class performer at the age of seven in 2010 when he won the Greenlands Stakes in Ireland before recording his biggest win in the Group One Betfred Sprint Cup. He remained in training for two more years, winning the Leisure Stakes in 2012 at the age of nine. Background Markab is a bay gelding with a small white star and white socks on his hind legs bred in England by his owner Hamdan Al Maktoum's Shadwell Stud. He was sired by Green Desert who finished second to Dancing Brave in the 2000 Guineas and won the July Cup in 1986. As a breeding stallion Green Desert sired the winners of over 1,000 races, including Oasis Dream, Desert Prince, Sheikh Albadou and Cape Cross. Markab's dam Hawafiz showed some ability as a racecourse, winning two of her five races in 2000 and 2001, and was a distant female-line descendant of the influential British broodmare Molly Adare. Markab was initially sent into training with Freddy Head in France. His name is an Arabic word ŸÖÿ±ŸÉÿ® meaning \\"the saddle\\". Racing career =2006 & 2007: early career= Markab was unraced as a two-year-old and spent his 2006 season competing in minor races in France. After finishing sixth on his debut he won a maiden race over 1600 metres over heavy ground at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse on 31 March. He finished third in races at Saint-Cloud Racecourse and Maisons-Laffitte in May before being dropped to sprint distances. Racing over 1200 metres he was runner-up at Deauville Racecourse on 4 July before running third at Maisons-Laffitte later that month. He did not race again in 2006. In March 2007 the colt was offered for sale at Doncaster and was bought for 33,000 guineas by the bloodstock agent E B Giles. He entered the ownership of the Tightlines Partnership and was moved to the stable of Kevin Morgan at Gazeley in Suffolk. Markab did not run for his new connections until September when he contested a handicap race over seven and a half furlongs on good to firm ground at Chester Racecourse. He was never in contention and was tailed- off in last place when pulled up by his jockey Paul Mulrennan. After another lengthy break he ended the year by finishing seventh of the eight runners in a handicap on the synthetic Polytrack surface at Lingfield in December. =2008: five-year-old season= Markab's first two starts of 2008 saw little improvement as he finished unplaced in minor handicaps on synthetic tracks at Lingfield and Kempton in January. In March he recorded his first win in Britain as he \\"stayed on grimly\\" to win a seven furlong handicap at Kempton at odds of 16/1. He was ridden in the race by Pat Cosgreve, who became his regular jockey. Racing on turf at Newcastle Racecourse in April he won again, leading from the start and winning by two and a half lengths in another small handicap race. Later that month he ran fifth in a more valuable handicap at Newbury Racecourse and then had another prolonged absence. Four and half months after his last appearance, Markab finished fourth in a handicap on the Lingfield polytrack on 5 September. He was seventeenth of twenty-nine runners in a valuable handicap at Ascot Racecourse later that month and then ran poorly when unplaced at Kempton in October. He returned to Lingfield for his last three races of the year beginning with a win in a seven furlong handicap on 6 November and then finishing second in similar events on 22 November and 7 December. =2009: six-year-old season= In 2009 Markab moved to the stable of the veteran Henry Candy at Kingston Warren in Oxfordshire although Cosgrave retained the ride on the gelding. From the start of the season he was moved up to compete in major handicap races on turf, starting with the Victoria Cup over seven furlongs at Ascot in May when he started a 25/1 outsider but raced prominently from the start before finishing sixth of the 27 runners behind Swift Gift. He then finished fourth of 26 to High Standing in the Wokingham Stakes and June and fourth of 26 again when favourite for the Stewards' Cup at Goodwood Racecourse on 1 August. Two weeks later the gelding was assigned a weight of 127 pounds for the Great St Wilfrid Stakes over six furlongs at Ripon Racecourse and started the 7/2 favourite against sixteen opponents. After racing prominently from the start he made a forward move in the last quarter mile gained the advantage inside the final furlong and won by a neck and a short head from Tamagin and Advanced. Cosgrave commented \\"I won on him when he was with Kevin Morgan and his owners wanted me to keep the ride. He was drawn on the wrong side in the Wokingham. At Goodwood I was criticised for making the running ‚Äì which, incidentally, I didn't ‚Äì but today I wanted to hang on to him. He always travels well and he has plenty of pace. I think he could be just as effective over a bit shorter.\\" Markab failed to win his two remaining races that year. He finished unplaced in the Portland Handicap and Doncaster Racecourse in September. He was then moved up to Group Three class for the first time to contest the Bengough Stakes at Ascot on 10 October and dead-heated for fifth place, three and a half lengths behind the winner Royal Rock. =2010: seven-year-old season= As a seven-year-old, Markab began his campaign in a minor stakes race at Thirsk Racecourse on 17 April and led from the start before winning by a neck from the Barry Hills-trained favourite Damien. In May he was sent to Ireland for the Group Three Greenlands Stakes over six furlongs at the Curragh and started 100/30 favourite in an eleven- runner field with the best-fancied of his rivals being Alfred Nobel, Jimmy Styles (Ayr Gold Cup) and the Listed winner Rain Delayed. He again led from the start and stayed on well in the closing stages to win by two lengths from Snaefell. Cosgrave commented \\"I thought he looked a lot better today than the last day, he clocked a very quick time at Thirsk and I thought he had improved about 5lb or 7lb for the run so I hoped he would go well\\". At Royal Ascot in June Markab was dropped back in distance to five furlongs for the first time in his career when he contested the King's Stand Stakes. Starting at odds of 14/1 he started well and tracked the leaders before moving up to challenge in the final furlong and finished second of the twelve runners behind the five- year-old Equiano. In the Hackwood Stakes at Newbury in July he started favourite but after leading for most of the way he faded in the closing stages and finished sixth behind Regal Parade. On 4 September Markab was one of thirteen horses to contest the Group One Betfred Sprint Cup over six furlongs on good-to-firm ground at Haydock Park and started at odds of 12/1. Starspangledbanner was made favourite, whilst the other runners included Kingsgate Native, Regal Parade, Lady of the Desert (Lowther Stakes) and Borderlescott. Cosgrave sent the gelding into the lead from the start and set the pace on the stands-side (the right-hand side from the jockeys' viewpoint). Despite edging towards the centre of the track in the closing stages and won from Lady of the Desert, Genki, Kingsgate Native, Starspangledbanner and Regal Parade, all of whom were racing on the opposite side of the course. His winning time of 1:09.40 was a new course record, and he became the joint- oldest winner of the race equaling the achievement of Boldboy who won as a seven-year-old in 1977. After the race Henry Candy commented \\"He got jarred up a little at Ascot. He has now won a Group One and it is incredible. I'd say 99.9 per cent of horses his age don't carry on improving but he has, and still is. He's bigger and stronger than ever, a very happy horse\\". =2011 & 2012: later career= Markab failed to win in five starts in 2011, when he raced in the colours of Mosaic Racing. In May he finished unplaced in both the Duke of York Stakes and the Temple Stakes, after which Dane O'Neill took over from Cosgrave as his regular jockey. The gelding produced his best effort of the season in July when he finished second to the Wokingham Stakes winner Deacon Blues in the Hackwood Stakes. In his two remaining races he finished unplaced behind Moonlight Cloud in the Prix Maurice de Gheest and then ran fourth when favourite for the Listed Starlit Stakes at Goodwood in September. Markab began his inal season by finishing fourth in a minor race over six furlongs at Haydock on 12 May. Sixteen days later he started 11/4 second favourite behind Genki (winner of the Chipchase Stakes) in the Leisure Stakes at Windsor Racecourse, with the other three runners being Elnawin (Sirenia Stakes), Angels Will Fall (Princess Margaret Stakes) and Medicean Man. The nine-year- old led from the start and fought off the challenges of Elnawin and Angels Will Fall to win by three quarters of a length. Markab ended his racing career in the Listed Hopeful Stakes in which he set the pace before being overtaken in the final furlong and beaten a length into second place by Hitchens.

She competed for a third time in Survivor: Winners at War, the show's 40th season, in 2020 where she finished in 4th place and was the final jury member. Although she has been largely praised for her individual game in Game Changers, she is also known for her long-lasting partnership with fellow contestant Tony Vlachos, who also took part in all three of her seasons, as the ‚ÄúCops R‚Äô Us‚Äù duo (in reference to both of them being police officers). The duo is \\"undefeated\\", as each of their seasons was won by one of the two, and they are largely recognized as one of the best duos in Survivor history, especially for Winners at War. Early life Lacina was born in Muscatine, Iowa,CBS 2 News @ 6, KGAN, Cedar Rapids, March 19, 2014 where she grew up with her parents Lorrie and Ronald. She attended Muscatine High School where she was a four-sport athlete.

Her mother, who has worked in law enforcement and has managed the Muscatine County Joint Communications Center, served as her inspiration to become a cop. Lacina once worked as a resource officer at Kennedy High School in Cedar Rapids. Afterwards, she joined the Cedar Rapids Police Department as a police investigator.

She immediately recognized that her tribe mate Tony Vlachos was also a cop, and though she tried to confront him about it, Vlachos denied it. However, he later told her he was a cop, and the two formed an alliance called Cops-R-Us. Aparri won the first four immunity challenges, but after the tribe swap, she was the only original Aparri member to remain on that tribe. She managed to reach the merge; however, after Solana, the other tribe left in the game, won the final pre-merge immunity challenge, Vlachos hugged the other four members of Solana while screaming \\"Top five!\\", which made her question Vlachos's loyalty. Following the merge, Lacina was the swing vote between the old Aparri alliance and old Solana alliance, and she became indecisive about her position. Vlachos tried to sway her back to his side, but she chose not to go back because she did not trust him. She wanted to vote him out at the first post-merge Tribal Council, but she ultimately agreed with the other members of the Aparri alliance to target Jefra Bland. However, Trish Hegarty of the Solana alliance wanted to target Lacina, and she pleaded with Kass McQuillen of the Aparri alliance to flip. At Tribal Council, McQuillen flipped and joined the Solana alliance in blindsiding Lacina. She finished in 11th place and was the first member of the jury. At the Final Tribal Council, Lacina voiced her frustration to Vlachos for swearing on his badge and going back on his word, and said she would have never done that. However, she ultimately cast her vote for Vlachos to win, which he did in an 8‚Äì1 vote. =Game Changers= Lacina returned for the 34th season, Survivor: Game Changers. She only went to Tribal Council twice before the merge due to being part of very strong tribes that did well in immunity challenges. After reaching the merge, she stayed in the middle, navigating between alliances, in order to have more options. For most of the post-merge phase, she positioned herself as the swing vote many times, turned on several of her allies (including Debbie Wanner), had a hand in several blindsides, managed to find the vote-stealer advantage and successfully play it, and inherited the Legacy Advantage upon Sierra Dawn Thomas's elimination. At the Final Six, Lacina successfully saved herself by claiming the immunity offered by the Legacy Advantage. She, Brad Culpepper, and \\"Troyzan\\" Robertson also formed an alliance, and all three of them managed to make it to the Final Tribal Council. Despite being accused, specifically by Ozzy Lusth, of backstabbing most of the jurors and using her social connections for strategic gain, the ways that she managed to have strategic control, be the driving force, and still maintain social connections were praised by certain jurors, particularly Zeke Smith and Michaela Bradshaw. She ended up becoming the Sole Survivor, and winner of the season, over Culpepper and Robertson in a 7‚Äì3‚Äì0 vote. She received votes from Smith, Bradshaw, Hali Ford, Andrea Boehlke, Cirie Fields, Aubry Bracco, and Tai Trang. Only Lusth, Thomas, and Wanner did not vote for Lacina; they voted instead for Culpepper, while Robertson received no votes from the jury. =Winners at War= Lacina came back as a contestant on the show's 40th season, Survivor: Winners at War. She was originally a member of the Dakal tribe, where she realigned with Vlachos and found the Vote Steal Advantage when she had to go to the other tribe to receive it, as per the note she received from Natalie Anderson, who was on Edge of Extinction. She was moved to the Yara tribe alongside Sophie Clarke when the tribe switch occurred. While they were outnumbered 3-2 and Lacina was a target on Day 14, she was spared when original Sele's Ben Driebergen and Adam Klein joined herself and Clarke in voting out Rob Mariano. Lacina reached the merge, where she reconnected with Vlachos and became a part of his majority alliance. Lacina became a target once again after she gave her reward to Nick Wilson on his birthday, which players like Klein felt was calculated. Later on, Lacina used her Vote Steal advantage to steal Denise Stapley's vote on Day 25, resulting in Tyson Apostol's elimination. While Vlachos later blindsided Clarke, Lacina still continued to trust and work with him. The two worked together to vote Spradlin-Wolfe, subsequently turning on and voting out allies Wilson and Stapley. On Day 37, she organized Driebergen's elimination but left Vlachos out in order to make a move against him and increase her chances of winning. On Day 38 she was pitted against Vlachos in the fire-making challenge. While her fire reached the rope first, Vlachos would go on to win, making Lacina the 16th and final member of the largest jury ever. At the Final Tribal Council, she remained loyal to Vlachos by voting for him to win. She was one of the twelve jurors that voted for Vlachos, making him the sole Survivor and second two-time winner in Survivor history. Personal life Lacina lives in Marion, Iowa, with her fianc√© and fellow police officer, Wyatt Wardenburg, and their son Knox.

A metal zipper is a zipper with its binding edges consisting of individual pieces of metal that are molded into shape and set at regular intervals on the zipper tape. Metal zippers are mainly made of brass, nickel and aluminium, and given their durability, they are mostly used in jeans, work-wear, heavy luggage and heavy-duty garments that must withstand high strength and tough washing. The metal zipper is the oldest type of workable zipper, having been invented by Gideon Sundback as an improvement of Whitcomb Judson's \\"Clasp Locker\\" that majorly consisted of a hook-and-eye shoe fastener. Description A metal zipper consists of two rows of protruding teeth made of metal. The metal teeth may be made of Brass, Aluminium or Nickel, and they are designed to interlock like clasped hands, linking the rows, thus creating a \\"Continuous Clothing Closure\\" as Elias Howe would have referred to it. For this to be possible, the metal zipper is usually fitted with a slider, often made of metal. The slider is operated by hand, and depending on the direction of its movement, the two rows of protruding metal teeth will either be interlocked or separated. This allows for full of partial fastening of the zipper depending on the user's preference. Metal zippers are most effective when used on heavy weight or thick materials such as denim and leather among other heavy-duty fabrics. These zippers are commonly found in denim trousers and jackets, leather outfits, shoes and heavy luggage and bags. Metal zippers are present in a wide variety of designs depending on their desired use, including open-ended, two way open-ended and two way closed-ended designs among others. These designs can be achieved by sewing one end of the zipper, sewing both of its ends together or allowing both of its ends to fall apart respectively. Unlike plastic zippers, metal zippers are stronger and more durable. Though, they also fail at some point and this may render the garment or bag unusable. Most metal zippers fail when the insertion pin tears loose from the tape, when one or multiple metal teeth fall off the tape or when the slider jams or breaks off. For the zipper to be usable again, it should be replaced or repaired. Types Metal zippers are found in various types as listed below. * Closed- end metal zipper. * Open-end metal zipper. * Two way open-end metal zipper. * Two way closed-end metal zipper. * Reversible slider. * Air and water tight metal zipper. * Double side teeth metal zipper. History The first attempt at making a zipper was in 1851, when Elias Howe was working on the \\"Automatic Continuous Clothing Closure\\". His creation resembled a drawstring and didn't really qualify to be an automatic zipper, but it was a great start for the zipper market. In 1893, Whitcomb Judson came up with an improvement of Howe's prototype which was basically a hook-and-eye shoe fastener. Even though his invention wasn't a practical zipper per se, Judson is still referred to as the father/inventor of the zipper. 1917 saw the invention of the first practical zipper by Gideon Sundback, originally referred to as the \\"Separable Fastener‚Äù. This is actually the first metal zipper that was made and it consisted of scoops of a special Y-shaped wire that were punched, nibbed and clamped onto a cloth tape to produce two facing rows that created a continuous zipper chain. 1923 saw Sundback's Separable Fastener's first use on a rubber boots. It then started being referred to as the \\"Zipper\\" from the \\"zip\\" sound produced when this device is used. Its use then moved to tobacco pouches, and in 1925, it was used on leather jackets. Ever since, the metal zipper has transitioned into denim trousers, children‚Äôs clothing, luggage, shoes, leather goods and other objects that require easier fastening. Components A metal zipper functions just like any other zipper, with a number of similar components. The components of a metal zipper include: ;Zipper teeth Also known as the chain, it includes the two continuous rows of metal teeth protrusions that are meshed together to close the zipper or separate it. The zipper teeth or chain is measured in terms of chain width gauge size. The bigger the gauge number, the wider the chain width. ;Slider This refers to the device that is pulled up or down to open or close the zipper. It is what clasps the zipper teeth or separates them depending on the direction of movement. Attached to it is the pull tab, the extension that is held when moving the zipper up or down. Some sliders come with a zip-lock feature in that, when the pull tab is lowered, it locks the slider in place and when raised, it unlocks it. ;Tape This refers to the strips of fabric to which the zipper teeth are attached. There are usually two strips of tape, with the sides with zipper teeth attached facing each other, and the other sides sewed to the outfit, luggage, shoes or other fabrics. The tape should have top and bottom extensions that extend beyond the teeth for easier sewing at the ends of the zipper. ;Top stop and bottom stop These are metal devices that are affixed at the top and bottom ends of the zipper respectively, to prevent the slider from coming out of the zipper chain. The bottom stop also prevents the already interlocked zipper teeth from separating into half. ;Insertion pin and retainer box These are found exclusively on separating zippers. The pin box or retainer box aligns the insertion pin and the rest of the separating zipper to begin clasping of the zipper teeth. The insertion pin is the metallic end of the zipper that it placed into the retainer box to allow the joining of the two halves of the zipper. Manufacturers The first manufacturer of the metal zipper was B. F. Goodrich Company in 1923. Since then, there have been a number of key players in the metal zipper manufacture industry, with the following being the most consistent and most respectable producers around the world. * Yoshida Kogyo Kabushikikaisha (YKK) (Japan) * Talon Zipper (USA) * Tex Corp (India) * Cremalleras Rubi (Europe) References Category:Textile closures Category:Fasteners Category:American inventions Category:1913 introductions ","title":"Metal zipper"},{"id":"51986859","text":"Hannah Ross (born January 28, 1990) is an American professional racing cyclist who rides for Rally Cycling.

As a privateer she captured one British warship before in 1781 the Royal Navy captured her. The Royal Navy took her into service as HMS Duc de Chartres. She then captured several American privateers and armed merchant vessels, and one French naval corvette in a noteworthy single-ship action. The Navy sold Duc de Chartres in 1784. Privateer Duc de Chartres captured HMS Pluto, a 16-gun sloop, on 30 November 1780. Pluto, under the command of Commander Thomas Geary, was about 140 miles south west of the Scilly Isles in drifting fog when she sighted a ship. Cautious, Pluto prepared for action and when the two vessels passed each other, they exchanged broadsides. Duc de Chartres turned and gave chase, catching up with her quarry. Unable to escape, and outgunned, Pluto struck. In spring 1781, Admiral George Darby sailed a fleet to Gibraltar to relieve the siege for a second time. On the way the fleet captured Duc de Chartres, the Spanish frigate Santa Leucadia, and the French brig Trois Amis. Although executed the actual capture of Duc de Chartres, the entire British fleet of 42 vessels shared in the resulting prize money.

HMS Duc de Chartres Between 26 May and 17 September Duc de Chartres was at Portsmouth undergoing coppering and fitting. The Royal Navy commissioned Duc de Chartres under Commander John Child Purvis on 7 October 1781 and he immediately sailed her for North America. Around August 1782 Duc de Chartres captured the Connecticut letter of marque schooner Turn of Times. She was armed with four guns and had a crew of 25 men under the command of John Cook.

The coil is sewn to a zipper tape to make the final product. The final zipper product is completed when the nylon coiled teeth are sewn onto the zipper tape. Nylon coil zippers have a continuous coil chain made from nylon. When this coil is positioned on the back of the zipper and not in the front, this kind of zipper is called invisible zipper.  Design  Nylon zippers are highly flexible and are available in a wide range of sizes. The high compatibility of the coil zippers is the main attribute for their huge number of applications in fashion wear, canvas goods, and bags. These types of zippers are also the top choice for the outdoor and luggage industries. Nylon coil zippers are most commonly found in tents, suitcases, backpacks, and other camping apparels. Though nylon coil zippers are a popular choice for a large number of applications, the use of nylon is now being replaced with polyester. Polyester coil zippers are also becoming widespread. They are made in various gauge sizes and colors. This makes them well-suited to several use cases. = Benefits = Coil zippers offer higher horizontal strength . Coil zippers are also easier to repair; an out-of-alignment tooth can be realigned simply by zipping and unzipping past it. Another advantage of nylon zippers is its two- way functionality. The sliders can be fixed in either direction of the zipper chain and they will can still function smoothly. Nylon is lightweight, heat resistant and rustproof, making nylon coil zippers durable and reliable. Manufacturing The main elements required in the manufacturing process of coil zipper are a stringer, slider, and a tab. The stringer consists of a tape and teeth assembly. The tab is used to pull the slider up and down which opens and closes the zipper. Applications ;Sports/Outdoor Apparel: Sports and outdoor apparel need a sturdy zipper that can withstand harsh use. Coil zippers are strong and therefore are commonly used for these kinds of outdoor apparel. ;Fashion/Apparel: Like all zippers, coil zippers are often used in general apparel. Zippers are often required in different designs or vibrant colors to match the garments. Coil zippers are easily produced in various colors and sizes and thus they are often used fashionable garments. ;Footwear: Shoes and boots that use zippers in their design need a zipper which is smooth in its operation and has high strength. Coil zippers use nylon that provides enough strength to these zippers that they function well even in high-end boots and shoes. ;Outdoor Gear: Outdoor gear such as camping equipment and backpacks often need to be robust or cover a longer length. Nylon coil zippers have high strength all across their length. They can be used in all the items which need long zippers.

The UN accused the Syrian government of a carrying out the attack in a \\"meticulously planned and ruthlessly carried out\\" air strike, first dropping barrel bombs, then rocketing the convoy, and finally strafing survivors with machine gun fire.UN: Both sides committed war crimes in Syria's Aleppo, Al Jazeera In all, fourteen aid workers were killed in the strike.  Background  In 2016, the Deir ez-Zor subdistrict of eastern Syria was one of the few remaining Syrian government strongholds in the embattled country. On 17 September 2016, the U.S. Coalition bombed Syrian troops near the city resulting in the deaths of between 90 and 106 Syrian Arab Army soldiers and the wounding of 110 more soldiers. The attack triggered \\"a diplomatic firestorm\\", with Russia calling an emergency United Nations Security Council meeting in response to the incident. On 19 September, the Syrian government declared a week long ceasefire that it had been adhering to over, effective at 7:00pm (DST), which was exactly when the ceasefire was set to expire. Shortly afterwards on that same day, sometime between 7:12 - 7:50pm or at around 8pm., the aid convoy was attacked.  Events  = Departure and arrival = According to the New York Times, the Red Crescent aid convoy of 31 trucks departed at 10:50 a.m from within Syrian government-held territory. Since the convoy was originally meant to have been accompanied by UN staff members it was visibly marked with both United Nations and Red Crescent logos. There were, however, no UN staff members aboard since the Syrian government had reportedly prevented them from leaving with the convoy. This single UN approved convoy, manned entirely by Syrian Red Crescent members, has been variously referred to as a U.N. convoy, Red Crescent convoy, and as a U.N.-Red Crescent convoy. The New York Times reported that aid workers accompanying the aid convoy were members of the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, which consists of \\"self-governed local branches in rebel territory\\" while it is \\"state- supervised in government areas.\\" About an hour after departing, the aid convoy reached the Syrian government controlled \\"Death Square\\" roundabout (named years ago after a car accident), the last government held checkpoint before entering rebel territory, where the convoy's Red Crescent volunteers from Aleppo switched places with Red Crescent volunteers from rebel-held Urum al- Kubra. The convoy arrived in Urum al-Kubra at around 2:00 p.m. that day. A Russian drone had been monitoring the convoy but Russian officials said that it had ceased operations at 1:40pm, although rebel sources said that the drone was still in the area at around 5:00 p.m.. = Attack = The attack began sometime between 7:12 - 8:00pm and ended at around midnight that same day. A relief worker who survived the attack said helicopters commenced the strike by dropping several barrel bombs. This was followed by jets flying conducting airstrikes, including strafing runs. A picture released after the attack shows the tail fin of a Russian-made OFAB 250-270 bomb lodged in debris. U.S. officials believe that Russian Sukhoi Su-24 aircraft took part as well. The International Committee of the Red Cross reported that 20 civilians were killed and that 18 of the 31 vehicles in the convoy were destroyed.  Reactions  = United Nations response = The U.N. condemned the attack. Although they initially described the attack as an airstrike, they later retreated from this and referred to it simply as an attack. = U.S. Coalition response = The U.S. and its coalition partners accused the Russian and Syrian governments of carrying out the attacks, and laid accusations (although not official charges) of war crimes. John Kerry, citing this incident, broke off bilateral ceasefire discussions with Russia. Syrian rebel media outlets and outlets running from the member states of the coalition largely supported the coalition's accusations. = Syrian and Russian response = The Syrian and Russian governments denied the charges and instead blamed the attack on terrorists groups operating in Aleppo. The Russian government further accused the U.S. of being aware of Russia's innocence and of using this attack to deflect attention away from the coalition's then recent attack against the Syrian government, which the U.S. denied. Syrian and Russian media outlets, as well as many of the outlets of their allies, largely supported their own government's accusations.  2017 United Nations report  On 1 March 2017, the Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights (OHCHR) debunked the Russian and Syrian propaganda and issued a report on human rights situation during the battle of Aleppo, finding that the Syrian Air Force deliberately targeted the humanitarian convoy, and that this amounts to a war crime.

Page (December 29, 1853 - December 21, 1935) was a Baptist leader and educator in Oklahoma and Missouri. He was president of four schools: the Lincoln Institute, Langston University, Western University, and Roger Williams University and principal of Douglass High School in Oklahoma City. He and George Milford were the first black students at Brown University. Early life Inman Edward Page was born a slave in Warrenton, Virginia on December 29, 1853 to Horace and Elizabeth Page.Simmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner. Men of Mark: Eminent, Progressive and Rising. G.M. Rewell & Company, 1887, pp. 474-480. His obituary had the name of the slave owner as Fanshot.Dr. I. E.

In this report, his father reported his master as a man named Alexander Craig, who died in 1859, and thereafter his wife, Mrs. Craig, and the executor of their estate, William H. Gaines. As a slave, Horace hired himself out and was running a livery stable in Washington, DC before the start of the war and had business in Warrenton and in Fauquier County. He had a number of horses and other supplies taken by the Union Army during the war and provided some manual labor. He was able to buy his freedom with money from his business. He did not finish paying until after the Emancipation Proclamation, but decided to pay the full agreed amount because the deal for his freedom was made before the war began.NARA M2094.

C. in 1862 and Inman attended the school of George F. T. Cook, brother of John F. Cook Jr. He also took hired work to support his family and later attended night school taught by George Boyer Vashon. He then took work at Howard University, grading the campus grounds, in order to pay for his schooling there. He was promoted to janitor at the school, and when Oliver O. Howard was working to close the Freedmen's Bureau, of which Howard had been a part, Page was hired as one of Howard's clerks. In this way, he was a student at Howard until 1873. =Brown University= In the fall of 1873 he and his friend George W. Milford became the first black students to enroll at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. The pair faced great discrimination, but at the end of his sophomore year he won an oratorical contest which endeared him to his classmates. His popularity increased and he was made class orator at the end of his senior year. Page delivered the class-day speech on the \\"Intellectual Prospects of America\\" and among the audience was D. W. Phillips who offered Page a position at the Natchez Seminary in Natchez, Mississippi run by the American Baptist Home Mission Society. He graduated from Brown in the fall of 1877 and moved to Natchez. In 1880 he received a A. M. (a master's degree) from Brown. In 1918, Brown president William Faunce honored Page with an honorary master's degree. Later he was awarded honorary degrees of doctor of law from Wilberforce University and from Howard University.Christensen, Lawrence O., William E. Foley, and Gary Kremer, eds. Dictionary of Missouri Biography. University of Missouri Press, 1999, pp. 590-591. =Family= In Providence in the winter of 1877-1878 he married Zelia R. Ball who had graduated in 1875 from Wilberforce University. They had three children, Zelia, Mary, and Inman E. Page, Jr. Page Jr. died at age seven. Zelia, later Zelia N. Breaux, became a widely known music teacher and Mary married Nolan Pyrtle, a professor at Wilberforce University.Franklin, John Hope, and John Whittington Franklin, eds. My life and an era: The autobiography of Buck Colbert Franklin. LSU Press, 2000, p. 53. Career =Lincoln Institute= In 1878 he moved to Jefferson City, Missouri and took a position as teacher at the Lincoln Institute. For his first two years at the Lincoln Institute, he was the only black regular teacher, but in 1880, the board of trustees decided to change strategies and have the school taught by black teachers and installed Page as school president. Page quickly began to grow the school, increasing enrollment from 97 to 153 in his first year, reducing student expenses, and securing appropriations from the state legislature to build two dormitories, on for men and one for women and an increase in bi-ennial state appropriations. In 1883 he was elected president of the Missouri State Teachers' association and was reelected to multiple successive terms. In 1887, the university added college work to its curriculum and in 1891 it was designated a land-grant institution and embarked on additional building construction, and the school expanded again in 1895. One of the first professors Page hired was Josephine A. Silone, who arrived in 1881 and taught chemistry, elocution, and English literature.Kremer, Gary R. Race and Meaning: The African American Experience in Missouri. University of Missouri Press, 2014, p. 44. Among the students Page influenced at Lincoln were physicians William J. Thompkins and J. Edward PerryKremer 2014, p. 188. and bishop William Tecumseh Vernon. In 1898, Page resigned from the presidency at the Lincoln Institute after facing political pressure to leave. =Langston University= In 1898, Page was lured to Oklahoma Territory to become the president of the Colored Agricultural and Normal University in Langston, Oklahoma. The school became known as Langston University, and Page was its head for 18 years. At Langston, Page was a success and the student population and the campus grew.Brooks, F. Erik, and Glenn L. Starks. Historically black colleges and universities: An encyclopedia. ABC-CLIO, 2011, p. 126. However, Page did not avoid controversy. In 1903 Page was tried for incompetency and mismanagement and was completely exonerated.Page Exonerated, The Leavenworth Weekly Times (Leavenworth, Kansas) June 18, 1903, page 1, accessed October 13, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7005660/page_exonerated_the_leavenworth_weekly/ In 1906 Page, a lifelong Republican, was removed from presidency by Democratic state politicians in 1916. He was replaced by Isaac McCutcheon for nine months and then by John Miller Marquess. =Later career= From 1916-1918, Page was president of the Colored Baptist College of Macon, Missouri, which was later known as Western Baptist Bible College and moved to Kansas City, Missouri. He then moved to Roger Williams University in Nashville, Tennessee to serve as its president. Page's health failed and he moved to Oklahoma City in 1920. In 1921 and 1922 he was supervising principal of the city's black elementary school and principal of Douglass High School. In 1922 he briefly returned to Lincoln Institute, then renamed Lincoln University of Missouri, when the board there pushed out then president Richardson,Holland, Antonio Frederick. Nathan B. Young and the Struggle Over Black Higher Education. University of Missouri Press, 2006, p. 128. but he resigned in August 1923 and returned to Douglass High School. He remained in Oklahoma City's public schools for the rest of his life. In June 1935 he retired with the honorary title of \\"principal emeritus\\". Death and legacy Page-Robinson Hall at Brown University On December 21, 1935 he died of old age at the home of his daughter, Zelia, in Oklahoma City. He was buried on the campus of Lanston University, and the tract where his remains were laid was called \\"Page Memorial Park\\". Multiple buildings in Oklahoma have been named in Page's honor. On May 19, 1950, Lincoln University named its library for Page. In 2018, Brown University renamed a six-story academic and administrative facility after Page and fellow alum Ethel Tremaine Robinson. Ralph Ellison was a student of Page's at Douglass High School and the two had a difficult relationship at that time. However, Ellison was inspired by Page and later in his life was deeply moved and inspired by a watercolor portrait of Page he saw at Brown's Rockefeller Library in 1979.Rampersad, Arnold.

Unlike preceding models, it features a rear liftgate rather than a side-opening rear door and no longer has the spare tire mounted on the rear door. The new CR-V is lower, wider and shorter than the previous models; the length decrease is attributed mostly to the fact that the spare wheel no longer adds length to the back of the vehicle. A lowering of the center of gravity is another benefit of the spare wheel being located underneath the rear cargo area. The center rear seat pass- through was also introduced as a new feature on the third generation. The third generation CR-V is powered by the latest version of Honda's standard K-series 2.4 L inline-four engine, similar variants were also found in the Honda Accord and Honda Element. In North American markets, this engine's power is rated at at 5,800 rpm and at 4,200 rpm. A 2.2 L i-CTDI diesel engine was offered in the European and Asian markets. The European market CR-V had the R20A 2.0 L petrol engine, based on the Honda R-series i-VTEC SOHC engine found in the Honda Civic, as opposed to the previous CR-V offering the K20A. Honda offered an integrated Navigation option on the EX-L model. The navigation unit was made for Honda by Alpine and includes voice activated control, XM radio (in the US and Canada), and an in-dash CD player that can play MP3 and WMA media. The media offerings also included a six-disc CD changer in the center console and a PC Card (PCMCIA) slot in the Navigation unit for flash memory MP3 or WMA files. A second CD player is positioned behind the navigation screen, which plays MP3/WMA CDs. A rear backup camera was also included. An iPod adapter was to be an available option on US models, but was only available as an add-on accessory. All CR-V models retained the auxiliary audio input jack, which is either on the head unit itself (LX), on the central tray (EX) or inside the center console (all versions of the EX-L, with or without navigation). Sales and production Interior For 2007, Honda CR-V became one of the ten best selling vehicles of the year. It overtook Ford Explorer, which had held the title for fifteen years (1991-2006), to be the best selling SUV in the US. In Canada, the CR-V was the second best selling SUV in 2007, behind the Ford Escape. To meet demand, Honda shifted some Civic production from East Liberty, Ohio to Alliston Plant #2, Ontario (where some Pilot, Ridgeline and Odyssey production was located until production was consolidated at Honda's Lincoln, Alabama facility) to free up space for additional CR-V production. Currently, the East Liberty plant is building 400 CR-V models a day for the Canadian and US markets. The U.S. market CR-V models are imported primarily from Sayama, Saitama, Japan and El Salto, Jalisco, Mexico in increasing numbers. In 2008, CR-V continued to be top ten bestseller and best selling SUV of the year in the U.S. Since its introduction in 1997, there were more than 215,000 CR-V sold in Canada.

The Honda CR-V was rated \\"good\\" in frontal and side-impact crash tests by the IIHS. However it was rated \\"marginal\\" in the roof strength test. An analysis conducted by the IIHS and released in June 2011, found that the 2007-08 MY CR-V had the lowest fatality rate in its class and among the lowest fatality rates among all vehicles.Status Report. Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. 9 June 2011. Retrieved 30 September 2016. EPA fuel economy ratings Since the introduction of a newer, five-speed automatic transmission, which sports a higher MPG rating and smoother shifting, the manual transmission was dropped from the US market. Fuel economy ratings from the EPA are city, highway. Consumer Reports rates fuel economy as city, highway. 2010 facelift For the 2010 model year, the CR-V received style, powertrain and equipment changes. The exterior changes included a redesigned front fascia with a new horizontal-slat chrome grille and honeycomb-designed lower front grille, new front bumper, and revised tail lights. The rear bumper was redesigned, as well as new five split-spoke 17-inch alloy wheels for EX and EX-L models. The interior received minor changes, including seat fabrics, as well as wider driver and front-passenger armrests. The audio head unit controls were altered and the information display backlighting in the gauges was changed to blue, instead of the previous black. A USB audio input became standard in the EX-L trim while hands-free Bluetooth connectivity was exclusive to the EX-L trim equipped with navigation system. In 2011, a mid- level SE trim debuted with a 6-disc CD changer and 17-inch 7-spoke alloy wheels that came from the pre-facelift EX and EX-L trims. Power was increased from for 2010 and mileage improved by 1 mpg for both front-wheel and all-wheel drive models. The EPA ratings were / city/highway and / city/highway respectively. Recommended oil weight changed from 5W-20 to 0W-20 from previous years with a change to the K24Z6 engine. The 2010 model year update went on sale in the United States in September 2009.

The version with 2.0 engine has 150 Hps at 6200 rpms, while the version with 2.4 engine has 170 Hps at 5800 rpms. = Indonesia = There are 3 variants of Honda CR-V: 2.0L M/T, 2.0L A/T and 2.4L A/T. The 2.4L A/T comes standard with single electric driver seat, Dual Automatic climate control, five-spoke rims, different level of interior trims and touch-screen enabled stereo system. All versions use FWD configuration. In early 2010, the third- generation Honda CR-V is updated with new front grille and minor interior trims. = Malaysia = In 2007, Honda Malaysia launched the third generation Honda CR-V that has only one variant 2.0L A/T (4WD) i-VTEC SOHC with a 5-speed automatic gearbox featuring 2 overdrive gears for better fuel economy during high speed cruising. This version 2.0L A/T (4WD) i-VTEC SOHC has 150 PS at 6,200rpm and a maximum torque of 190Nm at 4,200rpm. This CR-V come with dual i-SRS front airbags, rear parking sensors, active headrests, anti-lock brakes, electronic brake distribution and electric power steering. There is also ample trim level (17-inch alloy wheels), including cruise control, dual zone climate control, a 6-disc in-dash changer with MP3 and aux input, and steering wheel- mounted audio controls, however the seats are fabric, not leather. The Standard package includes a front aero bumper, rear aero bumper, tailgate spoiler, and a running board. The premium package includes a different tailgate spoiler, running board, and door visors. In early 2010, Honda CR-V Facelift officially launched with the one new colour call called Urban Titanium and new redesigned hood, sportier front bumper with fog lights, front grille, rear bumper with lens reflectors and new alloy wheels design (17-inch alloy wheels).This CR-V come with new fabric on the seats, a redesigned climate control knob, wider armrest on the front seats, and a new audio head unit with USB interface and in-dash 6 discs. This CR-V come with new features like Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA) and Dual side airbags with OPDS. This CR-V uses the efficient 150PS and a maximum torque of 190Nm with 2.0L A/T i-VTEC SOHC engine (R20A) mated with 5-Speed Automatic Transmission, Real-Time 4WD, rear parking sensors and Rack and Pinion (Electric Power Steering). One year after the launch of the new Honda CR-V facelift, Honda Malaysia launched the Honda CR-V ‚ÄúLimited‚Äù edition which is more expensive than the regular 2.0 i-VTEC CR-V but still uses the same 2.0L i-VTEC engine.  Europe  The CR-V facelift made available to European markets (as well as South Africa) features new added luxuries not previously seen before, and not available to Japanese, Asian or American markets. Xenon (HID) headlights are available for the first time, as are 18-inch alloy wheels (19-inch optional), GPS/DVD navigation system and a premium sound system with USB audio input. A panoramic glass moonroof is standard on upper spec models and all models feature chrome exterior door handles. Externally, the vehicle also features complete body color-coding, on all lower body plastic cladding (models sold elsewhere in the world feature dark grey plastic lower cladding). The 2.2 L i-CTDI N22A turbo diesel engine was discontinued and replaced by the 2.2 L i-DTEC N22B engine, increasing power output to 150 PS and meeting Euro 5 emission standards.  South America  In Brazil, the third generation CR-V was sold (imported from Mexico) with a 2.0-liter, i-VTEC engine instead of the 2.4-liter used in other countries. The reason is that in Brazil the tax is higher for engines above 2.0 liters. The Honda Accord sold in Brazil had the same 2.0-liter engine. In Peru, the CR-V has different trim levels. The two most equipped ones are the Deluxe and the Platinum. These two, in contrast with the models sold in the US feature chrome door handles and HID headlamps. The Platinum version also comes with rear parking sensors and 18-inch alloy wheels. It does not feature heated front seats because it is considered unnecessary due to the type of climate in Peru. There is no trim level featuring GPS. Trim levels are 4x2-L, LX 4x4, EX 4x4, Deluxe, 4x4, Top and Platinum.

Herman Carl Siegumfeldt (18 September 1833 - 27 June 1912) was a Danish genre and landscape painter. Biography Siegumfeldt was born at Haregabsgaarden in the parish of Esb√∏nderup in North Zealand, Denmark. He was the son of Heinrich Anton Siegumfeldt and Maren Cathrine Schou. At the age of eleven, he was admitted to the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. Later, he studied with Niels Simonsen (1807‚Äì1885) while taking practical courses in handicrafts.Biographical notes @ Kunstindeks Danmark. He won a small silver medal at the age of seventeen, but his financial situation was precarious, so he had to devote himself to crafts rather than continue his art studies. By the winter of 1854-55, he had saved enough to give all his time to painting and was able to make a sale to the Kunstforeningen. The following year, they acquired several more works. His simple, naturally composed works soon attracted a large audience. From 1857 to 1860, he concentrated on painting landscapes. Before he had quite achieved financial security, he injured his right arm during a trip to Sweden. It took several years to fully recover. Meanwhile, it required a great deal of effort to complete a canvas and he considered the possibility of having to give up painting. In 1863, pleased with one of his works, the Royal Academy granted him a travel allowance to study in Belgium, France and Italy. While travelling, his right thumb became inflamed and had to be amputated. He returned home and, following a long period of idleness, decided to give up art. The resulting depression led him to enter a mental hospital. He made a speedy recovery and, after three years, once again took up painting. By 1880, he was a member of the Royal Academy's organization committee and had produced some of his best-known portraits. In 1897, he created an altar painting of Paul on the road to Damascus for St. Paul's Church, Aarhus. He died during 1912 in Copenhagen.

Biography Panacea was born in Quarona in 1368, to Lorenzo and Maria Gambino Muzio. With the sudden death of her mother, her father felt his daughter needed a mother and married a woman named Margherita, from Locarno Sesia. She was a widow and mother of one daughter. After the remarriage of his father, Panacea, always devoted to good deeds and care for the sick, she began to suffer mistreatment and harassment from the new relatives.Pomi, Damiano. \\"Beata Panacea De' Muzzi\\", Santi e Beati, October 1, 2002 It is possible that her charitable activities drew her away from her chores. As described in detail by the most recent biographers, the girl was subjected to the most menial jobs. On one occasion, her father found her badly beaten, but apparently did nothing to intervene. A spring evening of 1383, Panacea, at the time she was just fifteen years old, was far away from home to look after the sheep; stepmother, not seeing her arrive, went to look for her. She went to the pastures on Mount Tucri overlooking the village and found the girl in prayer in the ancient hermitage of San Giovanni. Furious, Margherita scolded severely and, in the throes of a moment of fury, and repeatedly beat Panacea, killing her. Realizing what she had done, the woman threw herself in despair into a nearby ravine. The news spread quickly, and Panacea's body was taken to Ghemme and buried next to her mother in the cemetery adjacent to the Church of Santa Maria. Cult The cult of Panacea was widespread since the beginning of the fifteenth century, mainly in the local area, getting confirmation from the Catholic Church only in 1867. At the beginning of the fifteenth century were built as early as two oratories dedicated to her, one at the place where she died. The center of devotion to Panacea is the church in Ghemme, where her body now lies in a glass case, in the crypt designed by the architect Alessandro Antonelli. It remains a place of pilgrimage, particularly on the first Friday in May, especially by pilgrims from Ravenna. Panacea is the patroness of Valsesia.\\"Beata Panacea returns to Quarona in September\\", Notizia Oggi, March 11, 2018 In the diocese of Novara, her feast day is May 5.

Education  Gonzales earned a Bachelor of Arts from the University of New Orleans in 1985.  Work  Gonzales' paintings depict scenes of American Culture by using sources of imagery often taken from mass media and the internet. He uses factual components to find instinctive connections to abstraction through painting. Up close, the paintings appear pixelated; once glanced from a far the pixelation comes together and forms an intricate image. Gonzales became well known for presenting socially and political imagery, such as his paintings based around the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. This body of work gained much acknowledgement when it opened at Paula Cooper Gallery in 2001. His work has traveled to galleries and museums across the world where he has exhibited in group and solo shows.

Two were built with different engines and were used by the A√©ronavale for VIP transport and equipment development until 1938. Design and development The all-metal CAMS 80 had a one-piece high wire-braced wing. This was built around two spars and had three distinct sections, with a long rectangular centre-section which occupied just over half the span and was mounted, without dihedral, on top of the fuselage. It was braced on each side by pairs of wires, upper ones running from the engine mounting to the spars at the end of the wing centre-section and below from the lower fuselage to the same points. Stabilizing floats on short struts were also positioned there. The outer sections were almost triangular, though with rounded tips and set with about 7¬∞ of dihedral to keep the tips clear of the water. Ailerons filled their trailing edges. The CAMS 80 had a flat-sided fuselage. The planing underside was curved rather than V-shaped in cross-section and had two steps, one under the trailing edge of the wing and the other further aft. There was one open crew position in the nose, wrapped round with a long, shallow window and fitted with a flexible gun mounting. The pilots occupied an enclosed, multi-glazed cockpit ahead of the leading edge. Just behind the trailing edge there was another circular open gunner's-type position. At the rear the fin was broad and triangular with the tailplane, also triangular, mounted about half-way up. Both rudder and very high aspect ratio elevators were straight edged. It was an amphibian with retractable wheels on cranked axles with rearward drag struts hinged from the fuselage sides and with near-vertical shock absorber legs. Other struts facilitated the raising of the wheels above the waterline but no details are known. The CAMS 80 was powered by a single, tractor engine mounted centrally over the wing on pairs of narrow, transverse V-struts diagonally braced together; the forward pair contained a tall, tapered radiator. The engine was tilted slightly upwards and the propeller rotated over the wing. The two examples built were fitted with several different water-cooled engines. Whilst under construction in 1929 the first prototype was described as having a Hispano engine, but was on display, unflown, at the 1930 Paris Salon, with a Lorraine 18G Orion W-18 engine. The CAMS 80 was, however, first flown powered by a Hispano 12Nbr V-12 engine in 1932. A second prototype, flown two years later, powered by a Hispano 12Ydrs V-12, differed from the first aircraft in having an open cockpit. Operational history In September 1933 the first prototype went into service with the French Naval Air Arm following fin modifications and the successful completion of its reception tests at the Saint Rapha√´l base. There, early in 1934, it was contributing to long running tests of Ratier variable pitch propellers. Take-off time was reduced from about 19 seconds to 13 seconds, an improvement of 28%. It was later used to transport VIPs. The second prototype joined it in the Air Arm, flight testing navigational instrumentation and radio equipment. They were retired in 1938 because of corrosion.

Mission  Food Animal Concerns Trust (FACT) promotes the safe and humane production of meat, milk, and eggs. FACT envisions that all food- producing animals will be raised in a healthy and humane manner so that everyone will have access to safe and humanely-produced food.  History  FACT was involved with some of the first calls for cage-free eggs in the U.S. food supply. In 1984, FACT launched the NEST EGGS Project. The project was designed to demonstrate that farmers would make money selling eggs from uncaged hens. The Nest Eggs Project produced eggs from approximately 675,000 hens without cages on its farms. In 1986, FACT then launched the Rambling Rose Brand Veal Project. FACT developed a husbandry system for raising veal calves on pasture instead of in crates. Currently, FACT operates a Humane Farming program and a Food Safety program, while providing information to consumers.  Humane Farming Program  FACT's Humane Farming program provides farmers with grants, conference scholarships, mentorship opportunities, and webinars. https://foodanimalconcernstrust.org/humanefarmingprogram/ Typical past grant projects have focused on fencing, watering systems, or animal shelters in some way. Farmers have also completed a variety of unique projects involving constructing cattle scratching stations, planting trees to improve access to shade, and purchasing equipment for fly control.

The entrance is found on the second level of the renaissance cloister behind the apse of the Basilica of Saint Francis, which houses the remains of St. Francis of Assisi. Since 1986 the Museum has also displayed a collection of works donated to the Conventual Franciscan Friars by the Secular Franciscan and American art critic, Frederick Mason Perkins, who died in Assisi in October 1955. The Museum is part of the Associazione Musei Ecclesiastici Italiani (AMEI) and the network Museale Ecclesiastica Umbra (MEU).  History  In 1930, three years after the return of the Basilica and the Sacred Convent to the friars, the first exposition of the Treasure was put on display in the hall of Pope Pius XI at the western end of complex. The exhibition was designed to honor the works of the original patrimony which survived not only the ravages of time, but especially the plundering by Napoleon's troops (in 1798 nearly 390 kilograms of vestments in silver and other valuables were stolen). These works also survived the suppression of religious orders in 1866 during Italy's unification, when in any case the room in which the Treasure was kept, at the bottom of the bell tower, was already in a dilapidated state.Nessi, pp. 22-23. From documents found in the archives, especially from the old sacristy inventories (the first of which was taken in 1338), we can learn something about the evolution of the collection. But other sources also testify to the Treasure's development: the first biographies of St. Francis attest, for example, that in 1230 on occasion of the translation of Francis's body to the new church dedicated to him, Pope Gregory IX sent as a gift \\"a gold cross studded with precious stones in which is set a relic of the wood of the true cross. And with it decorative objects, liturgical objects and other objects to be used for serving at the altar, and extremely precious and magnificent sacred vestments.\\"Leggenda dei tre compagni, 72: Fonti francescane 1486 As many other gifts amassed during these early decades, their necessary care created various difficulties and also caused the followers of St. Francis (known as \\"il Poverello\\"), to have some misgivings. So in 1253, to resolve these conflicts, Pope Innocent IV intervened with this bull \\"Dignum Extimamus\\" recognizing that the friars were permitted use of these gifts but were not their owners, just as was the case for the entire sanctuary complex as directed by the Apostolic See. At the same time, he forbid the removal of any of these objects from the Basilica. This was reaffirmed by Pope Clement X in 1703.With the bull Cum sicut dilecti filii of 13 December 1703 it was forbidden to remove any objects whether for liturgical use or otherwise from the church or convent.  Site  It's essential that the Treasure's exposition be considered within the context of the monumental complex, made up by the Basilica and the Sacred Convent, that constitutes the original location for which the Treasure was formed and for which some works were in fact specifically made. The rooms in which the Museum is found today were part of the original construction of 1228, made at the bidding of Pope Gregory IX to the community of friars. This area would certainly have been used even if for short stays by the Pope who had put the entire complex under his immediate jurisdiction. In 1756 this area, sitting directly over the old dormitory (now known as the Sala Romanica), underwent heavy reconstruction in the Neo-gothic style, which is why it is today known as the Gothic Hall. It is precisely in this room that from 1977 the Treasure has been on view, while in the adjoining room, towards the so-called Papal Hall (the first site of the Museum), is the Sala Rossa, or Red Hall, in which since 1986 the F. M. Perkins Collection has been on display. The current arrangement of the works dates from the year 2000 when the Museum was reopened after extensive repairs were made to the structural damage caused by the earthquake of September 1997.  Works  Despite the impoverishment suffered during the course of its history, the Museum still contains works that can be admired for their great beauty and notable historical and artistic interest, allowing us only to imagine how much grander the collection was up until the end of the 18th century, when it remained in large portion intact.Nessi, p. 23. The collection contains for the most part works of the so-called minor arts, although it does contain some sculpture and paintings. Among that which has survived from the very start of the collection, we find clear testimony of the Treasure's international character in works of French origin (like the illuminated manuscripts from Paris from the middle of the 13th century; gold and silver metalwork, among which is the magnificent reliquary of the Seamless Garment as well as the reliquary of the thorn from the Crown of Thorns in classic Parigian gothic style from the second half of the 12th century; and also an elegant Madonna and Child in ivory, also in the purest French gothic of the 14th century), of Flemish origin (the tapestry of Pope Sixtus IV and a few ivory carvings), and of Germanic origin (the clock donated in 1701 by the Austrian Emperor Leopold I to Fr. Vincenzo Coronelli, and a few precious metal works from Salzburg). Gold and silver metalwork predominates: the reliquaries come in various forms and styles, and are from various places and times. Some are distinguished by their uniqueness, for example those of Saint Andrew (13th century) and Saint Ursula (14th century), decorated with gilded and engraved glass. Among the altar vessels are a number of chalices, from different epochs, of which the most celebrated is surely that of gold-plated silver and enamels made by Guccio di Mannaia and gift of Pope Nicholas IV, the first Franciscan pope, who reigned from 1288-1292. Also on display are: two rare Sicilian silk dossals from the beginning of the 13th century, works of Venetian glass (a crystal cross with miniatures from the early 14th century), and a number of painted works among which is the processional cross, painted on both sides, by the Master of the Blue Crucifix (late 13th century), and two altar panels by Tiberio di AssisiThe altarpanel shows the Crucifixion between saints and angels. It was commissioned by the confraternity of the Disciplinati in the first decade of the 17th century for the chapel of Saint Anthony the Abbot in the Lower Church. and Lo Spagna,The panel was commissioned in 1516 by the Third Order of Saint Francis for the chapel of Saint Catherine in the Lower Church.

Among the textiles deserving special mention is the Florentine altar-frontal which was based on a drawing by Antonio del Pollaiolo and donated to the Basilica by Pope Sixtus IV in (perhaps?) 1478 on the occasion of the 250th anniversary of the canonization of Saint Francis.Bargioli, pp. 244-245  The Frederick Mason Perkins Collection  In the second half of the 20th century, the Perkins Collection, made up of 56 paintings and a sculpture spanning the 14th to the 16th century, was donated to the Museum. The collection contains, to name only a few items, a portrait of Saint Francis by Beato Angelico, a Madonna and Child by Garofalo, two panel paintings by Giovanni di Paolo and three by Pietro Lorenzetti, a Saint Sebastian by dell‚ÄôOrtolanoMichele Danieli, Scheda 48 in: Natura e maniera. and a Saint Christopher by Sassetta.

Oshigami is a practice in the Japanese newspaper industry which describes the deliberate oversupply of newspapers to suppliers and businesses for the profit of the wholesaler. Along with the older age of the Japanese population (younger people are less likely to read newspapers), oshigami is one component of the apparent endurance of print circulation in Japan while printed media has seen rapid decline elsewhere with the rising popularity of online media. The practice of oshigami arose due to differences in the sales infrastructure of newspapers between Japan and other countries with large newspaper industries. Japanese print media is primarily funded from the sales of the media itself, rather than the sale of advertisements within the media, as is common in the US and UK. Less than 33% of revenue from Japanese newspaper companies is attributed to advertisement, compared to Western newspapers where the majority of revenue can be attributed to advertisement. This has led to a greater importance on the number of newspapers sold in Japan for the newspaper to turn profit, which in turn has led to distribution networks with very large circulation. As of 2015, more than 90% of Japanese households are subscribed to at least one direct-to-home newspaper delivery. Oshigami manifests itself at the regional level, in that the middle man may deliberately order, for example, 3200 newspapers for a neighborhood of 3000, with the excess never being sold. The practice of oshigami is illegal in Japan as regulated by the Japan Fair Trade Commission, however it is often hard to determine whether overprinting of newspapers occurs deliberately for the purpose of profit or accidentally. Overprinting of newspapers occurs in every country where newspapers are sold in the world, with roughly 18% of newspaper in the UK not being sold.

C1. Gideon Kibblewhite reviewed Daughter of the Drow for Arcane magazine, rating it a 4 out of 10 overall. He found the novel \\"disappointing\\" and calls Daughter of the Drow \\"a stab at a mini-series that quickly degenerates into a weak soap opera. The only interesting character is Gromph, the bitter and twisted archmage, and he rarely makes an appearance after the opening. The rest of the cast creak almost as loudly as the plot.\\" He continues, \\"But most sadly lacking is any feel or atmosphere. Although most of the action takes place deep within caverns of the Underdark, there is no fear, mystery or suspense. There are plenty of wands, portals and monsters, but alone they are not enough to engage the reader.\\" Kibblewhite concludes his review by saying \\"There are, though, some good moments; like the spectacular duel between two wizards in the centre of a volcano, or the scene when, as Gromph is about to cast his daily spell to re-start the city clock, a flock of evil spider- priestesses fly by on magic discs.

It is the first novel published for the setting. It was published in November, 1995. Plot summary The Iron Throne is set in a land where humans have tried to create an empire by warring with other races ever since they arrived from another continent. Subjugation of the elven aboriginals, and the bitter feud that ensued, was compounded by the constant threat from the other races who wish to claim the continent as their own. War is inevitable somewhere, and those who have the blood-power in their veins are trained in its arts from youth. Within the human realm, all manner of deceit and treachery is born of the ambition to assume the Iron Throne. Sister is pitted against brother, husband against wife, the crown against ambitious pretender, and civil war is brewing that will encompass the entire continent. Despite their bloody history, the elves form a tenuous alliance with the humans, to fight against the forces of evil spawned of the primordial battle where the gods gave up their lives and the dynasty of the blooded was born. Reception Jonathan Palmer reviewed The Iron Throne for Arcane magazine, rating it a 9 out of 10 overall. He describes the novel as \\"a veritable saga set in a beautifully believable land where humans have vied with other races for empire since their arrival from the ancestral continent.\\" He comments that \\"The author shows a good understanding of history and geography, of their effects on military campaigns and battlefield strategies, and of the fortifications and defences necessary to withstand attack and siege. Of particular interest to referees will be the impenetrable elven capital.\\" He adds that \\"Even the erotica is surprisingly well-written by the usual standards of the genre: marriages of political convenience and ill-conceived romantic liaisons of inconvenience abound. There is no respite from the intrigue of court life. The reader feels as though he (or, indeed, she) is a silent servant to the court, observing all the machinations of the courtiers, but at the same time being powerless to intervene. The whole thing is made all the more credible by its generally well-developed characters (even the non-human ones).\\" Palmer concludes his review by stating, \\"It has taken a writer who lives alone with his motorcycle on an Indian Reservation in Arizona to have the patience to create such a wonderfully alive fantasy world, with a mythology and captivatingly intricate plot to match. This is a truly splendid read with hardly a weak moment from start to unpredictable end.\\" Reviews *Review by Don D'Ammassa (1995) in Science Fiction Chronicle, #187 December 1995-January 1996http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?2876 References Category:1995 novels Category:Birthright (campaign setting) Category:Novels based on Dungeons & Dragons Category:Novels by Simon Hawke ","title":"The Iron Throne (Birthright novel)"},{"id":"51987819","text":"The Titan of Twilight is a fantasy novel by Troy Denning, set in the world of the Forgotten Realms, and based on the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game.

It is accessed from the District line tracks between Earl's Court and West Kensington or between Earl's Court and Kensington (Olympia). The Depot was constructed in 1871, when the Metropolitan District Railway gave notice to the Metropolitan Railway, who were running their trains for them, that they would henceforth run their own trains. Lillie Bridge Depot was built on derelict land to the west of Earl's Court, to provide stabling and maintenance facilities for the District Railway's rolling stock. In 1905, the District was extended, and a new depot at Ealing Common replaced Lillie Bridge. A year later, the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway, later the Piccadilly line, was opened, and the depot was reconfigured to provide stabling and maintenance for their trains. Parts of it were used as a permanent way depot, until 1932, when extensions to the Piccadilly line created a new depot at Northfields, and the site was purely used by engineering departments. It was reconfigured at this time, and again in 1962 and 1987. It housed a flash butt welding plant for producing long welded rails between 1937 and the completion of the Victoria line, when this facility was transferred to Ruislip depot. Subsequently, it was used for maintenance of London Underground's fleet of battery locomotives. Although the District Railway ceased to use steam locomotives for passenger workings in 1905, two were kept at Lillie Bridge for shunting duties. From the 1940s, all of London Underground's steam locomotives were maintained at the depot, after facilities at Neasden Depot were closed, and this continued until the last steam locomotives were withdrawn in 1971. A pioneering electro-diesel locomotive spent long periods at the depot from 1940, undergoing repairs, and after the demise of steam, the works shunter was an 0-6-0 diesel hydraulic machine obtained from Thomas Hill of Rotherham. Its use was restricted, due to its short wheelbase and axle loading. The Depot is scheduled to be decommissioned by 2024 by Transport for London, as part of an Earl's Court regeneration scheme. Engineering facilities will be moved to Acton Works, and it will be replaced by stabling for twelve S7 Stock trains at a lower level, with redevelopment taking place above it. The scheme has not been universally popular, attracting criticism from the Mayor of London, the current Hammersmith and Fulham Council, local housing associations and residents. History The Metropolitan District Railway opened its first section of route from South Kensington to Westminster on 24 December 1868. It did not at the time need depot facilities, because the service was worked by the Metropolitan Railway, using their own stock, who received 55 per cent of the receipts. This level of remuneration was tied to a particular service level, and if the Company wanted to run more trains, it had to pay more to the Metropolitan Railway. The District was extended on 12 April 1869, when the section from Gloucester Road via Earl's Court to West Brompton was opened. The Company disliked the arrangement with the Metropolitan Railway, and gave them notice that they wanted to run their own trains, which they did from 3 July 1871. To the west of Earl's Court station there was some former agricultural land, which was by then derelict, but was sometimes used as a site for a fairground. This land was used as the site for Lillie Bridge Depot, where the trains could be stabled and serviced. John Fowler, the engineer, pioneered the use of concrete in construction, and the sheds were probably the largest buildings with concrete walls to have been built at the time. Lighting of the carriages was by compressed oil-gas, which was stored in wrought iron cylinders mounted on the underframes. A gas producing plant was constructed at Lillie Bridge, and the gas was transported during the night to various points around the system. Access was by a junction on the Earl's Court to Olympia tracks, and required trains to reverse up a slope to reach the depot. The District extension from Turnham Green to Ealing Broadway was opened on 1 July 1879. It included a station named Mill Hill Park, which was renamed Acton Town in 1910. A new depot at Mill Hill Park was completed in 1905, as part of the electrification works for the District Railway, and the engineering functions were moved from Lillie Bridge to Mill Hill Park, which became known as Ealing Common Depot. In 1906, the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway opened, running from Finsbury Park to Hammersmith, with its engineering offices headquartered from 1907 in the neo Georgian building that is currently 16-18 Empress Place. Empress Place was originally called Richmond Place, and development took place in 1864-65 to the designs of the architect John Young, while the Piccadilly line engineering headquarters were purpose-built in 1907. It was a tube railway, but reached the surface just to the west of West Kensington station. The concrete building was demolished, and new car sheds were constructed at the depot, long enough to hold three of the six-car Piccadilly trains, which reached the depot by using the District tracks. At the rear end of the sheds there was a lifting shop. When the number of tracks to Acton Town was increased from two to four in 1932, as part of the Piccadilly line extensions, a new depot for Piccadilly line trains was built at Northfields, and Lillie Bridge ceased to be used for stabling trains. =Permanent Way depot= After the departure of District trains, parts of the depot were redeveloped as a permanent way facility. The organisation of the site was haphazard, and the facilities were primitive, but the location was well-placed, enabling works trains to reach most parts of the system relatively easily. The site had acquired a building made of corrugated iron, which housed the stores and machine shops. There was an area where crossings were laid out, and other areas where sleepers, rails and fittings were stored. The sidings and marshalling tracks left behind after the District Railway moved their works were used to assemble engineering trains, before they were dispatched onto the network. One problem with the site was that it was hemmed in by railways and built-up property, which meant that there was no prospect of extending it. London Underground considered relocating the works on several occasions, either to give the engineers more room, or later, because property developers were keen to buy the site, but on each occasion, that option was rejected because the location suited its use so well. A major reconstruction of the site took place in 1931-32, which was complicated by the fact that the depot was supporting a large new-works programme at the time, and so needed to remain operational throughout the rebuilding process. The track layout was entirely reworked, and concrete roads were installed. Space for the overhaul of signalling equipment and other permanent way work was provided by a new workshop and stores building, while a 10-ton Goliath crane with a reach of enabled anything in the stacking area and the crossing makers yard to be moved around as required. The improvements made were intended as the first of three stages, but subsequent development was not carried out because of the costs. London Underground pioneered the use of flash butt welded rail in the United Kingdom. Engineers, investigating the use of such techniques in 1936, found that the German State Railways had been using welded rails since 1928, so in 1937 a welding machine was bought from AEG in Germany, and installed at Lillie Bridge. It was used intensively until 1946, and was supplemented by a mobile machine which was mounted on a wagon. The welder had been specially made by the AI Electric Welding Appliance Company at Inverness in 1938, and they supplied a new machine for Lillie Bridge when the original AEG welder was scrapped in 1946. The depot produced long welded rails for use throughout the underground network, but also produced rails for British Rail, until they bought their own welding machines in 1947. The welding plant was installed inside the disused Piccadilly car sheds. In 1962, further reorganisation took place, when new offices were built to accommodate the overhaul of signals. The project also saw the introduction of a new canteen, carpenters' shop and plant shop. When the Victoria line was being constructed, a new rail welding machine was purchased from the Swiss company H A Schlatter, and installed at Northumberland Park depot. Once the line was opened from Walthamstow Central to Victoria, the new machine was moved to Ruislip depot, where a new welding plant was set up, and the Lillie Bridge plant was closed. This enabled the Piccadilly buildings to be repurposed as a maintenance facility for battery locomotives and a welding shop for the production of track equipment. Again, the track layout was improved, to make the marshalling of works trains easier. The whole site occupies around . Prior to 1935, the site was flanked to the east and the west by Earl's Court exhibition grounds, with a bridge crossing over the car shed to join the two sections. Work began on the Earls Court Exhibition Centre in 1935, and it opened in 1937. As part of that work, the southern end of the depot site was covered with a raft, which eventually became the base for Earl's Court Two, a second exhibition building opened in 1991. A major section of the Piccadilly car sheds was demolished at some point, as they were considerably shorter in 1951 than they were in 1916,Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 map, 1916 and 1951 the rear two-thirds having been removed. Some further redevelopment of the site took place in 1987, as part of the Earls Court Two project. =Rolling stock= Both the Metropolitan Railway and the District Railway were looking at electrification of their lines by the late 1890s, to eliminate the nuisance of smoke from steam locomotives. In 1898 they decided to conduct a joint experiment, and to run an electric train on the tracks between High Street Kensington and Earl's Court. They purchased a new six-car train for the trials, after considering the conversion of existing stock, and in May 1899 an order was placed with Brown, Marshalls & Company, who fulfilled the order just four months later. The train was delivered to Lillie Bridge, where Siemens Bros installed the electrical equipment. After preliminary trials from 9 December 1899, the train was used in public service from 14 May to 6 November 1900, and formed the basis for electrification plans for both railways. In addition to the passenger stock for the District line until 1905 and for the Piccadilly line from 1906 to 1932, the depot has been the base for a number of service vehicles. The last steam passenger working on the District line was on 5 November 1905, and 48 locomotives were sold for scrap. Six were kept, but by 1909, only two were still operational, and were used for shunting at Lillie Bridge, and working in Kensington goods yard. Kensington goods yard was situated immediately to the west of the depot, and was accessed by a separate curve which joined the District line tracks beyond West Kensington station.Ordnance Survey 1:2500 map, 1952 The operational locomotives were numbered 33 and 34, but No.33 was scrapped in 1925, and was replaced by a similar locomotive, bought from the Metropolitan Railway, which became No.35. They continued to perform shunting duties at Lillie Bridge until 1932. They were replaced by two new locomotives ordered from the Hunslet Engine Company in Leeds. They were 0-6-0 side tanks, and were numbered L30 and L31, the first London Underground steam locomotives to carry the \\"L\\" prefix. In addition to shunting at Lillie Bridge, they were used to move stores from the depot to Acton Works and Ealing Common depot, and occasionally took ballast trains to East Ham. Under the 1935-40 New Works programme, Neasden Depot became stabling facilities for electric passenger stock, and steam locomotives for passenger working were provided by the London and North Eastern Railway. Basic facilities for the small fleet of steam locomotives retained for maintenance work were provided at Neasden, but Lillie Bridge became responsible for the heavy maintenance of all remaining steam locomotives. London Underground retained three steam locomotives until 1971, which were used to convey steel tyres and other heavy materials between Lillie Bridge and Acton Works until February 1971. The last working trip was on 4 June 1971, when L90 left Lillie Bridge with a crane, bound for Neasden, but failed at Harrow, when its fusible plug blew, and it had to be rescued by battery locomotives. The official end of steam was two days later. For a number of years in the 1920s and 1930s, the depot was also the home of a preserved electric locomotive from the City and South London Railway. No.26 was eventually mounted on a plinth at Moorgate station but was badly damaged in an air raid in 1940 and was subsequently scrapped. In 1940, London Underground built an experimental electro-diesel locomotive, using two Central London Railway motor cars. Although it was never based at Lillie Bridge, it spent considerable periods at the depot, being repaired. There were several problems with it, some of which were caused by crews not being familiar with the controls. It was not a success, and was not used after 1956. A diesel- electric shunter was borrowed from British Rail in October 1954, and tested at both Lillie Bridge and Neasden, to see if it would be a suitable alternative to steam locomotives, but in the event, further steam locomotives were bought from the Western Region. When the final three steam locomotives were withdrawn in 1971, they were replaced by three 0-6-0 diesel hydraulic locomotives obtained from Thomas Hill of Rotherham. One was allocated to Lillie Bridge and another to Neasden, with the third acting as a spare. Unfortunately, the wheelbase was only , and this was too short to operate the track signalling correctly, so they were confined to working in the two depots. To overcome this, each was permanently coupled to a tender, to increase the wheelbase to . Even with this modification, they saw limited use outside of Lillie Bridge and Neasden, as their axle loading prevented them from crossing various bridges on the system. =Redevelopment= In 2008, with the election of a Conservative Mayor of London, plans were drawn up for the redevelopment of the Earls Court Exhibition Centre site, including Lillie Bridge depot and other surrounding land, covering an area of . Outline planning consent was granted to the redevelopment \\"masterplan\\" by the adjacent Conservative-controlled local authorities in November 2013, and Transport for London made an agreement with Capital and Counties PLC (Capco) to carry out the redevelopment of Earls Court exhibition halls 1 and 2, including Lillie Bridge Depot, as a joint venture, ECPL (Earls Court Properties Limited). Transport for London had been looking at options for the depot since 2010, and had reached the conclusion that the workshops could be relocated to Acton Works, with the Transplant maintenance facilities moving to Ruislip depot. However, there was still a need for stabling of trains at the site, and the intention is to construct a low-level box beneath the new buildings for this purpose. Ashfield House, which has provided office accommodation on the northern edge of the depot site, and since 2010 contained a realistic mock-up of a tube station for staff training purposes, known as West Ashfield tube station, is also to be vacated, with staff redeployed elsewhere, so that the building can be demolished. The consequent reconfiguration of Acton Works may require the Emergency Response Unit to relocate from there to another site. Following reports in November 2018 that the developers were in talks to sell most of their stake in the giant scheme to a Hong Kong billionaire, the stalemate with Hammersmith and Fulham Council deepened. In February 2019 news emerged that the council was considering a compulsory purchase order for the site to increase the amount and accelerate the delivery of badly needed affordable housing. As of 2014, the site was used for the stabling of up to ten S7 Stock trains, with three sidings used by Transplant for the stabling of maintenance trains. Departments located at the site were the Maintenance Infrastructure Services, the Track Manufacturing Division, the Track Delivery Unit, Plant Services, which covers workshops and stores, and the site also provided storage facilities for Transplant. Transplant maintenance facilities were in the process of being moved to Ruislip depot. London Underground initially thought that stabling for ten trains would be sufficient, but this was increased to 12, to allow for possible changes in service patterns, and the stabling of an engineering train, such as a rail grinder or a battery locomotive with wagons. Various other locations had been considered for the stabling of trains, but all were ruled out on the grounds of cost and associated risks. The new stabling box would provide six stabling tracks, each capable of holding two S7 Stock trains. They would be numbered from 1 to 6, from east to west. The facility to allow road-rail vehicles to drive onto the tracks could not be accommodated, and diesel trains would be excluded from using the site because of ventilation problems. In addition, the presence of an engineering train, which may be up to long, would reduce the number of S7 Stock trains that could use the facility to ten. In order to allow the development to take place, a number of buildings of architectural interest on Empress Place, including the former Piccadilly line (1907) engineering headquarters at Nos. 16-18, (currently, Capco's Project Rooms) and other Victorian retail outlets on nearby Lillie Road have been given a certificate of immunity by Historic England, which prevents them being granted listed building status. The certificate commenced on 13 January 2017, and runs for five years. The redevelopment scheme has not been universally popular, with aspects of it being criticised by Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London. Control of Hammersmith and Fulham Council changed in 2014 from Conservative to Labour, who were unhappy with the deal they inherited, and the housing associations for the two council estates that are due to be demolished continued to oppose the plans, as were the RMT union, who represent workers at the depot, and the Save Earl's Court campaign, a local pressure group.

Context The success of the Irish Brigade in France from 1690 to 1791 came to an unexpected end during the French Revolution, as it had always sworn loyalty only to King Louis XVI, and the former kings, as distinct from the French people. Louis was re-titled as \\"King of the French\\" and was then deposed on 10 August 1792 and within months he had been tried and sentenced to death. The Irish Brigade regiments lost their uniforms and were renamed and renumbered in 1791, and some of their officers were also executed, such as Th√©obald Dillon in 1792 and Arthur Dillon. As royalists and Roman Catholics, they were hostile to the dechristianization of France during the French Revolution and the whole concept of the French First Republic. Establishment When the War of the First Coalition included Britain from February 1793, it was not so surprising that many in the Brigade came to think of supporting their ancient enemy. The British Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger had recently tried to end Catholic grievances by promoting the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791 that was copied by the Irish Parliament in 1793. He supported the creation of St Patrick's College, Maynooth in 1795, allowing Catholic priests to be trained in Ireland. These were considerable reforms of the formerly harsh penal laws. Pitt invited several Irish Brigade officers to London in 1794 and offered to set up a \\"Catholic Irish Brigade\\", envisaged as 6 regiments that would be raised in Ireland and led by men such as Count Daniel Charles O'Connell (an uncle of Daniel O'Connell). This was agreed and formalised. However, recruitment was hampered by hostility and fear from the Protestant Ascendancy at the idea of raising such a brigade, competition from the Irish Militia, whose members would serve at home (see Militia (Ireland) Act 1802), and also some ridicule from the new and pro-French republican United Irishmen. Other officers, such as Henry Dillon, had no previous affiliation with France, but were cousins of, or descended from, officers of the formerly-French Irish Brigade. Saint-Domingue / Haiti In 1792 some regiments from the Irish Brigade were posted to Saint-Domingue (now Haiti), a French slave colony in the Caribbean, to put down a slave rebellion that had started in 1791. Assisted by local Irish-origin slave-owners they lost a skirmish at Les Plantons, and started local massacres to cow the population. L√©ger-F√©licit√© Sonthonax arrived from France in 1792 as Commissioner, and soon realised that freeing the slaves would be a better policy. This emancipation was effected by him in 1793, after the outbreak of war with Britain. The Irish Brigade units in Haiti then changed sides and assisted in the British invasion of Haiti in 1794-98 under General Thomas Maitland, and were paid for by Pitt. Some former Irish Brigade officers led new regiments raised in Jamaica that were mostly composed of African-origin soldiers. After several years of unsuccessful warfare, during which most casualties were caused by tropical diseases, Maitland signed a treaty in 1798 with Toussaint Louverture promising to leave, and in return Louverture promised not to foment a slave revolt in Jamaica. As well as Haiti, other units of the Catholic Irish Brigade were established in 1795 and posted to safer but more tedious and unglamorous garrison duties in places such as Nova Scotia. Summary While the Brigade only lasted for 4 years, with a maximum strength of 4,500 men, it demonstrated Pitt's understanding that many Irish Catholics would support his war against the French republican state. Losses from disease, difficulties in recruitment, competition from other formations and the outbreak of the Irish Rebellion of 1798 all ended Pitt's experiment. It can be contrasted with the Napoleonic Irish Legion that served France from 1803 to 1815. Bibliography * McDonnell, A ‚Äòfair chance‚Äô?

A mixture of the waffle batter and the doughnut dough are first poured into a waffle iron, then deep fried and finally decorated, with toppings similar to doughnuts. The wonut became popular in the spring of 2014 at the Waffles Cafe in the Lake View community area of Chicago, and its popularity quickly spread via bloggers and social media. It can now be found throughout the United States and beyond. Preparation The wonut is made from a combination of the ingredients of a waffle and a doughnut. The first stage of preparation is to pour the batter, which is slightly thicker than regular waffle batter, into a waffle iron. Then, the waffle is deep-fried until it is crisp. The final product can be glazed, frosted, and/or dunked in various toppings. History Following on the trend of the cronut, Waffles Cafe (3611 North Broadway, Chicago) included the wonut on its menu for a few months before it became prominent. In April 2014, bloggers and Instagrammers popularized the item around the country. The wonut was added to the menu to commemorate the opening of Waffles Cafe's second location in Streeterville and was first noticed by the Thrillist website. Among the early supporters of the food item were the Daily Mail and Jezebel, which DNAinfo.com author Serena Dai credits with causing the wonut to go viral. The creation, which was promptly featured on The Chew, is credited to Waffles Cafe owner Alex Hernandez, a product of Le Cordon Bleu and former manager of Japonais in New York. By May 2014, DK's Donuts made a product that they called wownuts, available to the Los Angeles area. The original Waffles Cafe location, which had been opened in 2012, was closed at the beginning of 2016 for renovation and was later that year shut down after losing its business license when it failed to pay a $15,000 debt.

Taxonomy and naming Glen Geddes bloodwood was first formally described in 1989 by Anthony Bean and Ian Brooker and given the name Eucalyptus xanthope. The description was published in the journal Austrobaileya from specimens collected by Bean near the Glen Geddes siding (about south of Marlborough) in 1988. In 1995 Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson changed the name to Corymbia xanthope. Distribution and habitat Corymbia xanthope grows in woodland communities with Eucalyptus fibrosa on ridges or slopes with sandy soils. It is found on the central coast of Queensland north of Rockhampton. Conservation status This eucalypt is classified as \\"vulnerable\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the Queensland Government Nature Conservation Act 1992. The main threats to the species are destruction of trees and habitat disturbance caused by mining activities.

He has been described as far-right and right-wing by several media publications. Kassam formerly ran in the party's November 2016 leadership election before dropping out of the race on 31 October 2016. He was most recently the global editor-in-chief of Human Events. Early life and education Kassam was born in Hammersmith Hospital, London. His parents were Tanzanian immigrants of Indian origin from Hillingdon, Greater London. He was raised an Ismaili Muslim, but wrote in 2016 that he had not been a practising Muslim for over a decade. Kassam is an atheist, stating that Christopher Hitchens' rejection of religious faith (\\"religions are versions of the same untruth\\") inspired him. Kassam was educated at Bishopshalt School, a state comprehensive school in Uxbridge and St Helen's College, Hillingdon, and then studied Politics at the University of Westminster. Kassam worked for the defunct American financial services firm Lehman Brothers before his career in politics. Career Kassam was a national executive board member of youth movement Conservative Future and director of campus anti-extremism group Student Rights, and campaigned against the London School of Economics for accepting money from Gaddafi's Libya; the university's director Howard Davies would later resign when new revelations revealed the extent of the institution's relationship with the Gaddafi regime. In a 2011 interview, Kassam named his idols as Michael Gove, Margaret Thatcher and Barry Goldwater, and spoke of his admiration for the United States' free markets. He has called his former university a \\"hotbed of radical Islam\\", citing the fact that Jihadi John was at his campus as evidence. In 2011, Kassam was employed as campaigns director at neoconservative foreign policy think-tank, the Henry Jackson Society. Kassam managed electoral campaigns in the UK and US, and was Executive Editor of The Commentator blogging platform, but left the organisation after falling out with the founding editor, Robin Shepherd, who described Kassam as \\"a danger to British democracy, and the rule of law\\". He has been a member of conservative think tanks such as the Bow Group, the neoconservative Henry Jackson Society, the Gatestone Institute and the Middle East Forum, and was involved in an attempted foundation of the UK version of the Tea Party movement. Kassam was a supporter of the controversial Young Britons' Foundation, described by its founder as a \\"conservative madrasa\\" which later shut down due to allegations of misconduct against director Mark Clarke. He and James Delingpole set up the London edition of the American far-right news outlet Breitbart News. Kassam left Breitbart in May 2018. In 2018, Kassam joined the Institut des sciences sociales, √©conomiques et politiques (Institute of Social, Economic and Political Sciences), founded by politicians in the far-right National Front Marion Mar√©chal-Le Pen and Thibaut Monnier, in Lyon, France. In March 2019, Kassam and lawyer Will Chamberlain purchased Human Events, a conservative American digital-only publication, from Salem Media Group for $300,000. Kassam became Global editor- in-chief of Human Events when it was re-launched on 1 May. It announced that he was leaving the outlet on 8 August. In July 2019, the Australian Labor Party called for Kassam to be banned from entering the country. Shadow Home Affairs Minister Senator Kristina Keneally said \\"We should not allow career bigots ‚Äî a person who spreads hate speech about Muslims, about women, about gay and lesbian people ‚Äî to enter our country with the express intent of undermining equity and equality.\\" In October 2019, Kassam began co-hosting War Room: Impeachment, a daily radio show and podcast with Steve Bannon, to nudge the White House and its allies into taking a more focused and aggressive posture to counteract the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump. Political views Describing himself as a nationalist, Kassam's politics has frequently been described as far-right by mainstream commentators and sources. He has also been described by media and academic sources as a figure in the alt-right. When running for leader in 2016, Kassam supported the repeal of a ban on former members of White nationalist parties, the National Front and British National Party from joining UKIP. Kassam has described Islam as a \\"fascistic and totalitarian ideology\\", described the Quran as 'fundamentally evil' and stated that \\"we are war with Shari'a\\" and has supported curbing Muslim immigration to the United Kingdom. Kassam's political and media strategies have been floated on US far-right \\"shock and awful\\" tactics which seen him openly advise UKIP leader Nigel Farage to make controversial remarks against HIV patients in 2015. Kassam has been a persistent critic of Labour Party Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, accusing him of turning the city into a \\"Shithole\\". and accusing him of having links to terrorism and extremism. UK Independence Party Following his period with the Conservative Party, Kassam became a UK Independence Party voter in late 2013, joined the party early in the following year, and soon became Nigel Farage's senior adviser. =Leadership candidate= After the resignation of Diane James as UKIP leader in October 2016, Kassam launched a campaign to become the new leader. On announcing his bid, he stated that he wanted to \\"stop infighting within UKIP\\", \\"address the deep cultural and social divides in this country\\", and \\"to become the real opposition and put this feckless Labour Party to bed.\\" His campaign slogan was \\"Make UKIP great again\\". In an interview with Evan Davis on the BBC's Newsnight, Kassam announced his intentions to resolve UKIP's \\"existential crisis\\" and pledged to increase UKIP's membership to 100,000. Kassam's activity on social media has attracted negative attention. In June 2016 he posted a tweet (later deleted) suggesting First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon should have her \\"mouth taped shut. And her legs, so she can't reproduce\\". After being criticised by the Scottish National Party MP Stewart McDonald on Twitter, Kassam replied that he would not be lectured to by a \\"National Socialist party\\". He later apologised. He has tweeted in the past that Suzanne Evans, a candidate in the second 2016 UKIP leadership election, should \\"fuck off for good\\", and questioned whether Labour MP Angela Eagle attended a \\"special needs class\\". After Evans said on The Andrew Marr Show that her \\"far right\\" and \\"toxic\\" rival would take the party away from the interests of ordinary people, Kassam questioned Evans' leadership capabilities and asserted that she had made \\"smears\\" against him. Farage repudiated Evans' comments about Kassam shortly afterwards. At the launch of his leadership campaign, Kassam called for a national referendum on the right of women in the UK to wear the niqƒÅb, claimed then-U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump does not hold anti-Muslim opinions, and cast doubt on the multiple claims of sexual assault made against Trump. He also labelled his movement as Faragist and quipped that he was the \\"Faragest of the Faragists\\". Kassam gained the personal support of Arron Banks, the principal funder of UKIP. Kassam \\"suspended\\", or withdrew, from the leadership contest on 31 October 2016, a few hours before nominations closed. Having concluded that he had only a slight chance of winning, citing insufficient funds, he criticised the media attention he received and was critical of what he claimed was media intimidation of his parents. He also questioned the fairness of a UKIP ballot. \\"When Times journalists show up at my elderly parents' house, intimidating them, I draw the line,\\" he said. In December 2016, Kassam admitted to editing his own Wikipedia page, a practice which is in violation of Wikipedia rules. =Later developments= In his October 2016 Newsnight interview, Kassam suggested that Donald Trump would be a better President of the United States than Hillary Clinton. A few days after the result of the American presidential election was announced, Kassam accompanied Farage when the former UKIP-leader was the first British politician to meet President-elect Trump, at Trump Tower. In January 2018, Kassam received media coverage for stating during a Sky News interview that London had become \\"a shithole\\" under Mayor Sadiq Khan, intentionally mirroring similar alleged comments U.S. President Trump made on immigration shortly before. Publications On 14 August 2017, Kassam published his book No Go Zones: How Sharia Law Is Coming to a Neighborhood Near You with Nigel Farage writing the foreword to the book. On 19 April 2018, Kassam self-published Enoch Was Right: 'Rivers of Blood' 50 Years On, in which he argues that politician Enoch Powell's anti-immigration Rivers of Blood speech has been realised.

Early life Kurt Enoch was born in Hamburg, then part of the German Empire, on 22 November 1895. He was the son of Otto Enoch (1860‚Äì1934), an entrepreneur and publisher, and his wife, Rosa. His parents were from a liberal Jewish background and encouraged their son to study literature and devote himself to his education.Margaret Enoch, ed., Memoirs of Kurt Enoch. Written for his family (privately printed: New York, 1984), p. 7. After graduating from school and working as a volunteer in the Gselliussche Buchhandlung, a bookshop in Berlin, the First World War began and he joined the German army and was sent to the Western front on 27 November 1915.Margaret Enoch, op.cit., p. 147f. Gebr√ºder Enoch Verlag Returning from the war in December 1918, Kurt Enoch began to help in the family business, which comprised a printing company named Gebr√ºder Enoch Verlag (English, \\"Enoch Brothers Press\\"), a book and magazine distribution enterprise and a publishing company.Michaela Ullmann, \\"Kurt Enoch - Refugee and Paperback Pioneer\\", in: Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German- American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present, vol. 5, edited by R. Daniel Wadhwani. German Historical Institute. Last modified 31 March 2016. He progressively came to realize that he was mainly interested in the profession of publishing rather than in printing.Margaret Enoch, op. cit., p. 45f. For this reason his father decided that the focus of the family business should henceforth be publishing and that the printing plant should be sold. Kurt Enoch completed a doctorate at the University of Hamburg and took over the family business from his father, whose health was declining. He strived for a national profile for the publishing business by seeking out important writers and talented new writers and adding foreign translations and books about other parts of the world to the catalogue.Margaret Enoch, op. cit., p. 46f. Albatross Books In 1932 Enoch joined the English translator John Holroyd- Reece and the German publisher Max Christian Wegner to found a publishing house with the name Albatross Books in Hamburg and launched a paperback book series named the Albatross Modern Continental Library. Similarly to the long established Tauchnitz Editions, this new series published inexpensive English- language reprints of American and British authors and sold them in all parts of the world except the British Empire. The list included highbrow authors (such as Virginia Woolf, James Joyce and D.H. Lawrence), middlebrow authors (such as Richard Aldington) and lowbrow writing (including detective fiction).Duncan Fallowell, \\"The books the Nazis didn‚Äôt burn\\", The Spectator, 13 May 2017. Retrieved 15 August 2017. However, the Albatross Modern Continental Library stood out in the marketplace \\"with an eye for design and colour\\",* Robert Eaglestone, \\"Strange Bird: The Albatross Press and the Third Reich, by Michelle K. Troy\\", Times Higher Education, 18 May 2017.

These bright and modern looking volumes sold in vast numbers. The series was soon outselling Tauchnitz Editions and in 1934 Albatross Books assumed editorial control of Tauchnitz. Enoch would act as the sole distributor for the series.Karl H. Pressler, \\"Tauchnitz und Albatross. Zur Geschichte des Taschenbuchs\\", Aus dem Antiquariat, Boersenblatt fuer den Deutschen Buchhandel, Frankfurter Ausgabe, Nr. 102 (December 1984). Flight from Germany and France The coming to power of the National Socialists meant that Enoch with his Jewish background found it increasingly difficult to work as a publisher in Germany. For that reason he transferred his shares in the company to his business partner Christian Wegner. He also arranged for the distribution of Albatross titles outside Germany to be handled through a newly founded firm that would be located in Paris and headed by himself. When war broke out in 1939, Enoch was briefly interned in France. With the German occupation of France, he realized he had to give up his publishing company and flee, and he managed to obtain entry visas for himself, his wife and his two daughters to the United States. They fled across the Pyrenees and through Spain and Portugal and finally arrived in the United States on 12 October 1940. Penguin Books Inc. After his arrival in the U.S., Enoch quickly set about getting in touch with colleagues in the American publishing world, including Fred Melcher of Publishers Weekly, \\"Ben Huebsch of Viking, Charles Scribner of the Scribner family house and Bennett Cerf of Random House\\".Gordon Graham, \\"Kurt Enoch: Paperback Pioneer\\", in: Richard Abel and William Gordon Graham, eds., Immigrant Publishers: The Impact of Expatriate Publishers in Britain and America in the 20th Century, New Brunswick, NJ, Transaction Publishers, 2009. p. 44. Unlike certain other German emigre publishers in the United States including Kurt and Helen Wolff who concentrated on publishing European classics and works from writers recently exiled from Nazi-ruled countries, Enoch eagerly sought available opportunities in the existing American market. He noted that there was limited access to books outside the larger cities of the United States, a gap that the firm Pocket Books was attempting to fill with inexpensive \\"mass market\\" fiction paperbacks. Enoch believed there was an untapped opportunity to publish paperbacks of non- fiction, of more sophisticated fiction, and of the classics. Enoch suggested to the British publisher Allen Lane that Penguin Books should move from just having an American sales agency for its British publications to setting up as a publisher in the United States. Lane agreed and Penguin Books Inc. was established with Enoch as vice-president and Lane and Ian Ballantine as business partners.Margaret Enoch, op.cit., p. 147f. The new firm was profitable but profits were small. At the end of the Second World War Ballantine wanted to take the Penguin Inc. list down-market and compete with mass market publishers like Pocket Books. When he was rebuffed, he left and went to set up Bantam Books, leaving Enoch in charge of Penguin.Gordon Graham, \\"Kurt Enoch: Paperback Pioneer\\", in: Richard Abel and William Gordon Graham, eds., op.cit., p. 45. Then Allen Lane, unannounced, brought in Victor Weybright to work in an executive role in Penguin Inc. \\"In fact Weybright had the impression that he was being brought in to run it.\\"Gordon Graham, \\"Kurt Enoch: Paperback Pioneer\\", in: Richard Abel and William Gordon Graham, eds., op.cit., p. 46. After some initial wariness, Enoch and Weybright came to respect each other's talent and work well with each other as partners in Penguin's American branch. In spite of the firm's increasing success, Lane was not satisfied: he disliked \\"Enoch's and Weybright's cover pictures and editorial choices\\" which violated his \\"more puritanical standards and personal taste\\" and his desire that Penguin Inc. be a mirror image of Penguin in the United Kingdom. New American Library In 1948, after two years of acrimonious relations with Lane, Enoch and Weybright bought out the Penguin equity in the company (except for the Penguin and Pelican trademarks which they surrendered) and renamed it as The New American Library Library of World Literature (which would be more commonly referred to over the years as the New American Library or NAL in short).Beth E. Luey, \\"New American Library\\", The Oxford Companion to the Book. Retrieved on 25 August 2017. Enoch was president of NAL until 1960.

In 1960 Enoch and Weybright sold the New American Library to the Times Mirror Company of Los Angeles. Enoch joined the Times Mirror Board of Directors. Martin Levin, president of the Association of American Publishers, summed up the achievements of the New American Library under the tutelage of Enoch, as follows: > New American Library was a brilliant concept well ahead of its time. Kurt > Enoch brought his special skills to this line of books.

In 1962 Enoch and five other American booksellers visited the Soviet Union as part of a U.S. State Department cultural exchange program.\\"Russians Termed Hungry For Books\\", Los Angeles Times, 30 November 1962. He served on the American Book Publishers Council, the National Book Committee and the Franklin Book Program. He wrote numerous articles on the \\"paperback revolution\\" and its importance in providing millions of ordinary citizens with access to quality books with tough and independent thinking at a modest and affordable price. Retirement In 1967 Enoch retired from the Times Mirror Book Division. In 1968 he opened a business in New York City specializing in publishing. He died on 15 February 1982 while on holidays in Puerto Rico. Personal life Enoch married Hertha Rehse Frischmann in late 1921. They had two daughters, Ruth and Mirjam (later known as Miriam).

In addition, one or two key symptoms of each of the following disorders are also included: obsessive-compulsive disorder, specific phobia, panic attack, motor tics, vocal tics, and substance use. CASI combines the Child Symptom Inventory (CSI) and the Adolescent Symptom Inventory (ASI), letting it apply to both children and adolescents ages 5 to 18. The CASI is a self-report questionnaire completed by the child's caregiver or teacher to detect signs of psychiatric disorders in multiple settings. Compared to other widely used checklists for youths, the CASI maps more closely to DSM diagnoses, with scoring systems that map to the diagnostic criteria as well as providing a severity score. Other measures are more likely to have used statistical methods, such as factor analysis, to group symptoms that often occur together; if they have DSM-oriented scales, they are often later additions that only include some of the diagnostic criteria. It is not yet clear scientifically whether a statistical or DSM-oriented approach is more useful at a clinical level. The CASI provides a low burden way of gathering a lot of information quickly about common problems, helping the clinician and family decide where to focus attention during interviews and treatment.  Overview  The number of items in the inventory vary by version, but all versions report four separate scores: * Symptom count scores which reflect symptoms that are evident and reflect a DSM diagnosis * Symptom severity scores that create T scores using normative data-severity scores range from 0 (never) to 3 (very often), and are viewed by a clinician as clinically significant if happening often (2) or very often (3) * Impairment scores for each sub-category in order to determine the degree to which symptoms for each disorder interfere with functioning in both social and academic settings * Clinical cutoff scores that compare the symptom count score and impairment score There are both parent and teacher versions, completed by each, that are submitted to the professional working with the youth at his/her appointment. It is important to acquire information from both of these sources because there are different demands placed on youth in different environments and the different settings bring out different aspects of symptoms for different disorders. Furthermore, one care provider may be better at accurately evaluating symptoms in the youth over others. Lastly, knowing the different settings in which the symptoms manifest in the youth is essential in adapting the most successful treatment plan. The teacher version differs from the parent version in many ways. The main difference is the addition of items that address information regarding behavior in educational settings as well as academic performance to the teacher version. Furthermore, the teacher version excludes disorders that develop primarily in the home setting (i.e., separation anxiety, oppositional defiant disorder), as well as items in the parent checklist that the teacher would be unable to answer (i.e., regarding sleep, eating habits, activity at night). In order to compare the versions most accurately, the teacher version was not renumbered, but instead excludes the items that don't pertain to it. The wording of both version's was made user friendly by replacing psychiatric jargon of the DSM with more easily understood phrases by the care providers.  Versions  *CASI-4R: This is the original version of the CASI, which combines the CSI-4 and ASI-4 to derive symptom counts that map to behavioral and emotional disorders in the DSM-IV for children and adolescents ages 5 to 18. Parent/Caregiver version:142 items, 8 pages Teacher version: 105 items, 7 pages Research version: 163 items *This version is used by longitudinal projects (lots of discussion of do we follow the new criteria because 10 years of data asking it the other way; in general longitudinal projects do no not want to switch halfway through; used by LAMS; *CASI-5: This version was created in 2013 to include the changes made from the DSM-IV to the DSM-5 and therefore replaces the CASI-4R, however it does include all of the items from the CASI-4R. Changes/additions include the addition of new disorders, as well as changes in names of disorders, symptoms, and scoring for some disorders. The new disorders added to this version include disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, avoidance/restrictive food intake disorder, binge eating disorder, and social communication disorder. *Parent/Caregiver-context of the home: 173 items, 8 pages *Teacher version-context of school: 125 items, 7 pages Development and history The CASI began as two separate measures that were developed to assist clinicians in obtaining information about youths from their caregivers. Although a variety of checklists were already available, most were not clearly connected to the diagnostic system used by psychiatry and many other professions. The authors saw this need and began to create a symptom checklist in 1984 that was based on the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Their goal was to obtain information about children who were receiving special education services so that they could assign them into groups based on their learning and behavioral problems that were more relevant to conventional psychiatric diagnoses (need citation). In this way, the measures helped gather information that helped the clinician form a diagnostic impression. The items also rated the severity of the symptoms. Adding them created a severity score that help guide selection of treatment targets. The original motivation for developing the checklist was to aid with research and gathering of fairly large amounts of data in schools; however, the creators soon saw the possible application of these symptom inventories in clinical settings. To that end, they began work in 1986 on an instrument that would be used by teachers and parents to give a comprehensive look at a youth's emotional and behavioral symptoms. This led to the earliest measure related to the CASI- the Stony Brook Child Symptom Inventory-3 (CSI-3). In 1987 this was followed by the CSI-3R based on the revised third edition of the DSM (DSM-III-R). The CSI-3R included both teacher and parent checklists. The teacher checklist focused on youth behaviors more likely take place in a school setting. In 1990, Dr. Gabrielle Carlson adapted the parent checklist from the CSI-3R for use with adolescents, which became the first version of the Adolescent Symptom Inventory (ASI-3R). After the fourth edition of the DSM was published in 1994, the CSI-4 was developed in response to those changes. The CSI-4 was available in both Spanish and English. In 1995, the ASI was also updated to the ASI-4 to account for modifications in the DSM. Impact The inventories provide a low cost way of gathering information efficiently and organizing it in a way that maps to diagnostic classifications. The checklists also make it straightforward to collect and compare information from multiple informants. Teachers and parents oftentimes spend much more time with the youth than the clinician does. There are both parent and teacher checklists available. Clinicians can look at both the Symptom Count scores and the Symptom Severity scores and analyze them in order to determine whether or not it surpasses the Clinical Cutoff score. The assessment can be used to measure symptoms over the course of treatment. The CASI-PM, also known as the assessment's progress monitor, is a facet of the inventory that is used to both monitor and analyze certain outstanding symptoms to see if there are disorders that are comorbid with other disorders that already exist within the patient. Thus, this part of the inventory can be used to track change in symptoms as the child or adolescent develops.  Use in other populations  The most recent version of the inventory has thus far only been used in the United States. The YI-4, the ECI-4, the CSI-4 and the ASI-4 are all available in the Spanish language. According to the website, the creators of the inventory intend to make it even more accessible by translating it into more languages. Limitations The assessment is commercially distributed; see details on the official website. Published versions are currently limited to English and Spanish language. The changes made to DSM-5 required some alterations in content and scoring of the CASI. Because it is so new, less research is available about the version that corresponds with the DSM-5.

First meeting in 1924, they were the first \\"United\\" monthly meeting, reconciling Philadelphia Quakers after the Hicksite/Orthodox schism of 1827. The original Meeting House, built in 1931, was located at 100 E. Mermaid Lane in the Chestnut Hill neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was replaced in 2012-2013 by the current meeting house, located at 20 E. Mermaid Lane, which incorporates a Skyspace designed by Quaker light artist James Turrell, the second such installation to be incorporated into a working religious space. The new Quaker meeting house is the first to be built in Philadelphia in eighty years. The Meeting House is an active center for worship and the activities of the Monthly Meeting. Since 1955, it has been a part of the Philadelphia Quarterly Meeting. The meeting has participated in the Yearly Meetings of Friends. The multi-purpose building offers a variety of programs that are open to both Quakers and non-Quakers. The meeting works with the Northwest Interfaith Hospitality Network to provide short term housing for families in transition. It also engages with other community organizations such as the Friends Council and Mt. Airy Learning Tree. Formation of the meeting In 1924, the Abington (Orthodox) and Philadelphia Quarterly (Hicksite) meetings in Philadelphia established the Chestnut Hill United Monthly Meeting of the Society of Friends, a united meeting for worship. Their first meeting was at the home of Robert and Elizabeth Yarnall on November 9, 1924. They were the first monthly meeting to reconcile members of the Hicksite and Orthodox Yearly Meetings, a schism that had split the Friends in 1827. The group was officially recognized by the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting in 1933, becoming the Chestnut Hill Monthly meeting. Original meeting house Exterior, 100 East Mermaid Lane, Philadelphia Interior, 100 East Mermaid Lane, Philadelphia The original Chestnut Hill Friends Meeting House at 100 East Mermaid Lane was built in 1931. The building was one story high, in a sprawling ranch-style building with a low-pitched gable roof. The facade was made of stucco and rubble stone over load-bearing concrete block. The building contained a meeting room and adjacent space, which could be joined by opening folding doors between them; a central gabled vestibule, a kitchen, restrooms and classrooms. Windows let in the light. The building at 100 Mermaid Lane was innovative for a Quaker meeting in a number of ways. The \\"ranch-style\\" design was reminiscent of residential architecture, connecting traditional meetinghouses with more modern domestic forms. A fireplace hearth was substituted for the \\"facing benches\\" traditionally used by ministers and elders. The partitions that had traditionally separated men and women during meeting for business were removed. In this way, the design of the meeting house emphasized the equality and the lack of hierarchy of the meeting. The building of the new meeting house led to an unanticipated increase in membership, almost doubling the meeting in size. The meeting house's limited space and poor accessibility for older members were factors in the eventual decision to build a new meeting house. The decision to build a new space was taken after many years of considered deliberation. The original building was eventually sold to United Cerebral Palsy. Modern meeting house Exterior, 20 Mermaid Lane, with stormwater garden Retractable roof for Skyspace The modern Chestnut Hill Friends Meeting House at 20 East Mermaid Lane was designed by architect James Bradberry of Bryn Mawr, working with natural light artist James Turrell and Chestnut Hill Meeting members. It is intended as a modern embodiment of Friends' testimonies of simplicity and equality. The meeting house incorporates a permanent light installation donated by Turrell. Turrell's 76th Skyspace, it is entitled Greet the Light. It is the second Turrell skyspace to be located within a Quaker meetinghouse, and was inspired by its predecessor, Live Oak Friends Meeting House in Houston, Texas. Approximately 2/3 of the cost of the building was raised by members. The meeting also received a National Endowment for the Arts grant to help fund the project. Ground was broken for the new building, the first new Quaker meeting house to be built in 80 years, in May 2012. The new meeting house was constructed between August 2012 and August 2013. In spite of construction delays due to an incident of arson that caused substantial damages, the new building opened for worship in September, 2013. The two-story L-shaped building is sited on a partially wooded 1.8 acre-site not far from the location of the original meetinghouse. Emphasis was placed on green architecture, sustainability and environmentally friendly construction practices. Built in a former quarry, the surroundings are naturally landscaped and include green stormwater management features. The building was expected to meet LEED platinum standards of construction. The main entrance to the building has floor-to-ceiling windows and a slate floor. Sliding pocket doors connect the foyer and the meeting room . A 600 square foot \\"gathering room\\" contains a fireplace and a library. A 1200 square foot social room adjoins a kitchen and opens to an outdoor terrace. The second floor includes classrooms and a mini-kitchen and a handicapped-usable bathroom and shower, essential for the work of the Interfaith Hospitality Network. The building is wrapped on several sides by a wide porch, reminiscent of traditional meetinghouses. The skyspace is installed in the 36-foot-high vaulted ceiling of the 1600-square-foot meeting room. The room has plain white walls with 24-foot-high windows, their sills deep enough to sit it, that fill the room with natural light. The floor is made of reclaimed long leaf yellow pine. The skyspace was first opened to the public for selected sunrise and sunset viewings of Turrell's Skyspace Greet the Light on October 20, 2013. A viewing lasts approximately 50 minutes, at dawn or dusk. When the retractable roof is opened, light from the sky enters the meeting space through the skylight, combining with a sequence of pre-programmed LED lighting around the vaulted ceiling. The roof is not opened for viewing in bad weather.

These costumes show their social status and background. Pantalone typically wore tight red pants and a matching shirt, a long black cape, black or red pointed shoes, and a belt that had a purse attached. Pantalone also carried a knife and handkerchief, and wore glasses. His hat sat very close to his head, and did not have a brim ‚Äì very much like a skullcap. He might also wear a codpiece.Lea, K. M.

Playing Commedia: A Training Guide to Commedia Techniques. Portsmouth, NH: Heinemann, 2001.Oreglia, Giacomo. The Commedia dell‚ÄôArte. Translated by Lovett F. Edwards. Introduction by Evert Sprinchorn. New York: Hill and Wang, 1964. Il Dottore was dressed almost entirely in black ‚Äì shoes, pants, shirt, robe, belt, and hat ‚Äì broken only by a white handkerchief, white ruffled collar, white cuffs on his sleeves, or maybe white socks. The pants came to his knees, as did the full cloak that stood out, like a dress with a petticoat. His hat could either be small and look like a skullcap, or larger and floppy with a wide brim. Il Capitano did not have a consistent dress code, but he did have a consistent costume theme. He wore the current soldiers' outfit from a foreign country. Sometimes his clothes were slashed to show that he had been in battle. His hat was overdone and typically had large feathers sticking out of it. Ribbons and shiny buttons often cluttered his clothes. He always carried a sword, and in the seventeenth century the sword upgraded to a gun. Every Il Capitano costume also included a coat or cloak, that he could fling off in a moment of rage or passion. The Lovers wore whatever was the latest fashion. They wore a lot of makeup, but tastefully done to match the elaborate outfits. They never wore masks. Pulcinella always had white baggy pants and shirt, large buttons on the shirt, and a piece under his garments that made his belly appear very large. His clothes were held on by a rope belt, where a dagger and purse would hang. A humpback piece was sometimes used. He also wore a mask that depicted a large, sometimes broken nose. His hat was short and fluffy.Gordon, Mel. Lazzi: The Comedic Routines of the Commedia dell‚ÄôArte. New York: Performing Arts Journal Publications. 1983. Scaramouche Harlequin's costume has varied over time. At first, in the mid sixteen century, his clothes were light colored and baggy, with red, yellow, and green patches with no particular pattern. His facial hair suggested a younger man for a few years, but then a fuller beard was worn later. He had a black mask and a feathered white hat. About a hundred years later, his signature outfit changed to include white stripes and colored diamonds, or triangles instead of patches. For the next 200 years, the suit got tighter, and a black belt was added. He wore a hat with two points, and his clothes had lots of sparkles. By the twentieth century, all the sparkles, collar ruffles, and large fancy hats were gone. Arlecchino wore a very small hat, the mask was sometimes swapped out for a face-painted diamond, and the costume pattern became entirely made up of diamonds with a small bow or collar. Brighella wore a servant's suit of rough off-white fabric, trimmed with green on the sides of his pants and down the front of his long shirt. His mask had a hooked nose, beard, and mustache. His dagger was worn at his belt. Coviello had a lighter beige mask with a large nose, and his white costume had bells attached. Mezzettino wore servant's clothes with red stripes, but without the common servant's mask. Zanni was the main servant, who wore large loose pants and a shirt that had a hood. Scapino wore outfits with white and green stripes, and his mask had a hooked nose and pointed beard. Pierrot had loose white clothing, with a large matching collar. He painted his face white instead of wearing a mask. Pedrolino's costume was essentially like Pierrot's ‚Äì white, big buttons, short hat, and white face ‚Äì but it was way too big for him, and the sleeves covered his hands, to emphasize that Pedrolino was a little person in hand-me-downs. ' copied Pierrot's clothes, but wore them in blue instead of white. Columbina's costume reflected her current master's, but included an apron. She wore no mask, but instead a bonnet, and her skirts were of different colors. Scaramouche wore black clothes without a mask. Defiant eyebrows and a powdered face accompanied the large black mustache. He had a white collar, and a large loose hat that hung down over his neck. Tartaglia wore a black hat and very thick glasses. Rosetta was Pulcinella's maid or wife, who wore a dress with patches, like the early Arrlechino. Trivelino was a Zanni who dressed in the Arlecchino fashion.

The earlier part of it was built at the end of the sixteenth century and was given major alterations in 1661 in Artisan Mannerist Style. It is red brick in English Bond with recent tiles over a thatched roof. It became a domestic residence in the 1960s and in 2016 it was purchased by Heritage Lincolnshire for restoration.The Old King's Head gets a new lease of Life Architecture The term Artisan Mannerist Architecture was first used by Sir John Summerson in 1953 to describe the building style that developed after the Renaissance in Britain when artisan craftsmen such as masons and bricklayers took on the role of architects. The style was largely derived from Dutch architecture. Sir John's study was largely restricted to larger stone buildings, but John Harris who worked with Sir Nicholas Pevsner on the Lincolnshire volume of Buildings of England adopted the terminology Fen Artisan Style and described the Old Kings Head as an example of Fenland Artisan Mannerism. Harris went on to describe other examples of similar buildings. These include the nearby Blossom's Hall also in Kirton, the Elizabethan House and The Hall at Coningsby, the Porch House Sibsey the Church House at Boston and the Bulls Neck and adjacent farm near Holbeach. The style is probably best exemplified by the manor house at Aslackby, near Bourne. Here the house has raised brickwork decoration and elaborate string courses, while the square chimney stacks are angled in a line in a similar fashion to those on the Old Kings Head. The style contrasts with the Artisan brick mannerism of North Lincolnshire and Humberside which has been studied by Neave and is often associated with the work of Hull architect William Catlyn. Neave derives this architectural style from the brick architecture of the Netherlands.Neave (1996), pp18-25 This origin is also likely to be true for Fenland Artisan Mannerism where houses often also have Dutch gables  Old King's Head Gallery File:Kirton-in-Holland - geograph.org.uk - 732913.jpgOld King's Head File:Kirton-in-Holland - geograph.org.uk - 732920.jpgOld King's Head from King's street.

Aracne editrice. Accessed 6 November 2017 is an American music producer, author and lecturer on violence prevention.\\"Ian Brennan On Dealing with Anger\\", Today FM, Sunday Best with Neil Delamere, 30 August 2015. Accessed 24 October 2017 He has authored five books, two on anger, Anger Antidotes (2011) and Hate-less (2014); a novella, Sister Maple Syrup Eyes (2015); and two on music, How Music Dies (or Lives) (2016) and Silenced by Sound (2019). Brennan travels in search of countries and languages whose music is under-represented internationally, making field recordings of musicians and producing albums of their work. He started out making nine albums of his own music, and hosting benefits, making live recordings and releasing compilation albums of local bands in San Francisco. Of the albums he has produced, Tinariwen's Tassili (2011) won a Grammy Award for Best World Music Album and Zomba Prison Project (2015) was nominated; and Ramblin' Jack Elliott's I Stand Alone (2006) and Peter Case's Let Us Now Praise Sleepy John (2007) were nominated for Grammy Award for Best Traditional Folk Album. The Sunday Times (London) says he is \\"visionary\\". Early life Brennan was born in Oakland, California to James Brennan, a railroad engineer, and Marilyn Brennan, a nurse from a tiny town in eastern Kansas. He grew up on the Pleasant Hill border in the same suburban home his entire life. He and his older brother and sister have a mere two-and-one-half year span between the three of them. This is due in part to his sister, who is the middle child, being born more than two months premature with Down syndrome. At age five, he began playing drums and switched to guitar at age 6, which he taught himself to play. Career =San Francisco Bay Area= At age 20, he self-released his first solo album and went on to produce eight more. He reflects now that he was his \\"own worst enemy\\" and made some of the \\"most horrible albums possible\\" due to his obsessive-compulsive, autocratic approach. Beginning in 1996, for five years he hosted a free, mostly acoustic music show in a San Francisco laundromat. He would perform solo and feature a different local band each week. He documented the shows as field recordings and these resulted in three Unscrubbed compilation albums in 1997‚Äì1999. Brennan also regularly organized benefit shows for social and/or political causes during this period with artists such as Merle Haggardhttps://www.sfgate.com/music/article/Jezebelle-crooners-live-music- lives-on-Steven-2890651.php and Kris Kristofferson.http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/Kris-Kristofferson-and-Steve- Earle-6352 Most notably he presented Fugazi, Vic Chesnutt, and Sleater-Kinney for free in Mission Dolores Park to honor the 20th anniversary of Food Not Bombs in 2000, as well as staging Green Day and The Blind Boys of Alabama for free in front of the steps of San Francisco's City Hall on the Sunday before George W. Bush's election as President, also in 2000. He received two Grammy Award nominations for producing albums in the traditional folk category (Ramblin' Jack Elliott's I Stand Alone in 2006, and Peter Case's Let Us Now Praise Sleepy John in 2007). The Ramblin' Jack record features Lucinda Williams and members of Wilco, X, Los Lobos, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. =International work= In 2009, he and his wife, the Italian-Rwandan filmmaker, photographer, and author, Marilena Delli, began traveling the world in search of countries and languages that were underrepresented internationally. Amongst others, this has resulted in releases from Rwanda, Malawi,Grant Smithies, \\"Of mice, Malawian men and melodies\\", Stuff.co.nz, 1 February 2015. Accessed 24 October 2017 South Sudan, Cambodia, Tanzania, Romania, Pakistan, Vietnam, from within Kibera in Nairobi, Kenya and most notably from inside Zomba Central Prison in Malawi. In 2011, he won a Grammy Award for the Tuareg band, Tinariwen's Tassili album, which was recorded live in the southeast Algerian desert just months before the Arab Spring erupted and war swept through the area. The album also includes members of TV on the Radio, the Dirty Dozen Brass Band, and guitarist Nels Cline. In 2015, he gained a nomination for Grammy Award for Best World Music Album for Zomba Prison Project, the story of which was covered around the world including on the front-page of The New York Times and by the television program 60 Minutes with Anderson Cooper reporting. The segment won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Feature Story and was nominated for two other Emmys. Brennan has also produced many of filmmaker, John Waters' live stand-up comedy shows since 2001 at venues such as The Fillmore in San Francisco and the Royal Festival Hall in London, as well as at festivals including Coachella, Bumbershoot, and Bonnaroo. Brennan has created pairings for Waters such as with Jonathan Richman, Peaches, and Wanda Jackson. Brennan has spoken about music at the Smithsonian Museum, the University of London, The New School (New York), the Berklee College of Music, WOMEX,https://www.womex.com/virtual/piranha_arts_1/event/conversation_between the Le Guess Who? festival in The Netherlands,https://www.leguesswho.nl/lineup/music-academy-sessions-1-ian- brennan and WOMADelaide in Australia. =Production style= Brennan is known for his fly on the wall style of production and is often compared to Alan Lomax. He states that relationships and emotion are what interests him, not technology. He often prefers to work with those who have no previous musical experience and hearing from historically persecuted populations. He advocates for embracing imperfection as a partner and prefers to record outdoors and 100% live, without any overdubs. =Mental health background= At age 20, in need of a way to support himself, he began working in locked psychiatric hospitals as a counselor. He continued to do so for another fifteen years in psychiatric emergency rooms in Oakland and Richmond, California. In 1993 he was asked to develop a curriculum and teach his co-workers in verbal de- escalation at East Bay Hospital in Richmond. This request was based on his having regularly demonstrated skill at de-fusing emotionally charged and violent situations. Through word of mouth, he began teaching full-time at hospitals, clinics, jails and schools in the San Francisco Bay Area and greater California. This teaching eventually led him around the country and then the world, having now taught in Africa, Southeast Asia, Europe, Australia, and the Middle East, at such places as University of California, Berkeley, the Betty Ford Center, and the National Accademia of Science (Rome). =Political activism= Brennan has worked to establish a memorial for those who have died from homelessness in San Francisco. The installations were unanimously approved by the Board Of Supervisors, but later stalled due to opposition from the Mayors Office and the Chamber of Commerce. In the fall of 2019, Brennan produced a \\"sonic memorial\\" album featuring voices and songs from the homeless community of West Oakland.https://datebook.sfchronicle.com/music/producer-taps-voices-of- oaklands-homeless-community-for-new-album =Writing= At age 19, Brennan's poetry was published for the first time in an anthology (Fineline Thunder) curated by his adult-school creative writing workshop instructor, Betty Solomon. He was published again that same year in the Berkeley poetry journal, Agape.

He owned the Suhr House at Gammeltorv in Copenhagen as well as S√∏lyst north of the city and was the founder of the foundation, Den Suhrske Stiftelse. Early life Suhr was born into a wealthy family of merchants in Copenhagen in 1792. His father was P√¶d Berendt Suhr, owner of J. P. Suhr & S√∏n which had been founded by Johan Peter Suhr (1712-1785). The company traded in a wide range of products, including coal, salt, linum and hemp. It survived the difficult years during the war with England in the 1800s. Theordor Stuhr finished school and had plans to study theology. Career A bill of lading from J. P. Suhr & S√∏n with a drawing of coal loading in an English port When their father died in 1815, he and his elder brother Didrik Suhr joined the management of the company which was formally owned by their mother until her death in 1842. The company went through a difficult period with the settlement of its activities in Norway followed by an agricultural crisis but experienced new growth in the late 1820s and early 1830s. The company increasingly specialized in import of coal and iron from Sweden and England. In the 1830s, J. P. Suhr & S√∏n had a market share of more than 20% of the Danish import of coal and it later grew to 33 &. The company was also active as a money lender with ties to leading bankers in Hamburg. In 1827, Suhr moved into the industrial sector when he leased the rolling mill in Frederiksberg. He established a production of copper plates and installed the first large, Danish-built steam engine (20 jp) in 1828. In 1830, he acquired Brede Copper Mill (Brede V√¶rk). In the 1850s, he sold those activities but continued to have investments in industrial enterprises such as √òrholm, Strandm√∏llen and M. P. Allerup. He had also investments in industrial enterprises abroad. When his mother died in 1842, Suhr became the sole owner of the company after buying out his brother and sisters. At this point he had an estimated net worth of 800,000 Danish rigsdaler and by 1853 it had doubled to 1.6 million rigsdaler. In late 1855 he ceded the company to his nephew Ole Berendt Suhr (1813‚Äì1875) but remained active in it for another few years. Property In 1840, Suhr acquired the Schimmelmann family's country house S√∏lyst in Klampenborg. He kept a large household and socialized with the cultural and political elite. Suhr acquired Bonderup in Holb√¶k during 1853 and Merl√∏segaard in 1856. Personal life Christine Caroline Andrea Suhr Suhr married Christine Caroline Andrea Falch on 30 March 1816 in the Church of the Holy Ghost in Copenhagen. She was the daughter of merchant and bank commissioner Andreas Falck and his wife Charlotte Sophie Suhr (1756‚Äì1822). The couple had no children. Suhr took active part in public life. He was a member of the Council of 32 Men from 1822 to 1835. He was active in the preparations for the first st√¶ndervalg and was also active in Trykkefrihedsadressen in 1835. He was appointed to Etatsr√•d in 1847. He constructed a summer residence at Bonderup where he died in 1860. He is buried in Gentofte Cemetery. He left his fortune to a foundation, Den Suhrske Stiftelse. J. P. Suhr & S√∏n was dissolved in 1897 after selling its activities to A/S Det danske Kulkompagni.

In the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, he expressed the opinion that Russia would not tamper with US voter machines.  Reception  = Cyber War Versus Cyber Realities: Cyber Conflict in the International System = Francis C. Domingo praised the book in Journal of Information Technology & Politics as a groundbreaking empirical work that provided multiple significant contributions to the literature in international relations. Joe Burton, reviewing for H-Net, declared it to be an essential contribution to the cyber security literature, one that took a meticulous and quantitative approach to dispel the hyperbole of mis-characterization, overstatement, and outright fear-mongering around the locus of cyber-attacks. Julien Nocetti, in International Affairs viewed it as a comprehensive and sobering book. John E. Gudgel, reviewing for Small Wars & Insurgencies, saw the book as providing a new perspective on cyber conflict and praised the authors' construction of a database of cyber incidents and disputes between countries -- the Dyadic Cyber Incident and Dispute Dataset (DCID), as one of the first viable attempts to quantify the impact of cyber actions. Overall, he concluded that the authors had build a strong case for cyber policy. Courteney J O‚ÄôConnor, reviewing for Political Studies Review, extensively praised the book and their construction of a data-set, for the purpose. He considered it to be a well-researched, accessible and referenced text, that brought much needed scrutiny and development to the field of theory around the domain of state-based cyber interactions. = Russia‚Äôs Coercive Diplomacy: Energy, Cyber, and Maritime Policy as New Sources of Power = David W. Rivera, reviewing the book for Perspectives on Politics, judged that it had its moments of brilliance as well as weaknesses. Whilst Rivera praised the authors' knowledge of Russia's foreign policy and found the chapters on cyber warfare and the multilateral diplomacy surrounding ownership of the Arctic Ocean to be excellent, he noted the book to be outdated in light of recent political developments and lacking in an optimal treatment about the efficacy of coercion as a diplomatic tool. He concluded:- \\"Russia‚Äôs Coercive Diplomacy is an impressive piece of social science in many ways, but it is also a work that falls between two stools.\\" = Cyber Strategy: The Evolving Character of Power and Coercion = The book was subject to mixed reviews Giampiero Giacomello of Perspectives on Politics deemed it an original, well researched, and well-presented book but remarked on its failure to present any unexpected or new information on the subject. He also praised the remarkable literature review of cyberspace present in the book.

It has a single erect leaf and one or two white flowers with red markings on a flowering stem up to tall. Description Caladenia bigeminata is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber. It is sometimes found as a solitary plant or otherwise in small groups. It has a single erect leaf long, wide and blotched with red near the base. One or two flowers are arranged on a raceme tall, each flower bright white with red markings and wide. The dorsal sepal is erect, long, wide. The lateral sepals and petals are about the same length as the dorsal sepal but about twice as wide, spreading widely at their bases but drooping near their ends. The labellum is bright white with red stripes and spots, long, about wide, narrow triangular in shape with three lobes. The labellum has red teeth on the sides and two pairs of lines of cream-coloured calli along its centre. Flowering occurs from late July to early September. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia bigeminata was first formally described by Andrew Brown and Garry Brockman in 2015 from a specimen collected near Northampton. The description was published in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (bigeminata) is a derived from the Latin bi- meaning \\"two\\" and geminus meaning \\"twin\\" referring to the two pairs of rows of calli on the labellum. Distribution and habitat This spider orchid is only known from a small area near Northampton in the Geraldton Sandplains biogeographical area where it grows in shallow, sandy soil which is often under water in winter. Conservation Caladenia bigeminata is classified as \\"Priority One\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is known from only one or a few locations which are potentially at risk.

Her mother and younger sister died when Sarah was a young girl, and the remaining family moved to Newtownards, Northern Ireland in 1906. They later emigrated again to Preston, Ontario where Sarah attended the Toronto Western Hospital School of Nursing, and went on to complete postgraduate work at the Fordham Hospital in New York City focusing on tuberculosis and public health. Her first nursing practicum was at the Royal Jubilee Hospital in Victoria, British Columbia. In 1921, Sarah returned to Preston as the nurse in charge of the local branch of the Victorian Order of Nurses. She was a forerunner of the well-baby clinic concept. This was an initiative that spread across North America. She also ran weekly conferences for mothers and preschool-aged children with her sister Annie (also a VON). Throughout their time as VON nurses in Preston, they delivered about 2000 babies in a time when most births happened at home. Miss Savage was honoured for her public health nursing service with the Jubilee Medal by King George VI. She retired from the VON in 1952 but continued to practise private nursing. She was a life member of the British Columbia Nurses' Association and a member of the Ontario Provincial Nursing Association.

It is a broad, south-facing slope with a grade of about 8%, situated between the Saddle Mountains and the Columbia River's Hanford Reach. It has been described as \\"basically a 13-mile-wide gravel bar\\" created by the Glacial Lake Missoula floods at the end of the last ice age about 15,000 years ago. Much of the Slope, part of the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, was added to the Saddle Mountain National Wildlife Refuge in 1999. Much of the remainder is used for viniculture. Human use Washington State Route 24 extends from Mattawa, Washington on the western edge of the Slope nearly due east-west. Mattawa is the only population center on the Slope. There was once a town of Wahluke and a Wahluke ferry that crossed the Columbia to the north of White Bluffs. The land was acquired by the U.S. government for the Hanford Nuclear Reservation and the residents, including Wanapum people, ordered to leave in 1943. In two actions in 1953 and 1958 the Atomic Energy Commission returned almost to public use, mostly for agriculture with irrigation recently provided by Columbia Basin Project sources.

He is the founder and artistic director of Bloom Room, an agency specialized in \\"creating the extraordinary\\": interior design, art direction, furniture and object design, branding, and graphic design. He is known for the creation of extraordinary furniture pieces like 'Le Refuge' for LJ Edition.  Early life and family  Marc Ange was born on April 11, 1978 in Rome. His official biography begins with \\"Marc Ange was born in the Holy City of Rome, under the terror of the Red Brigades, in a rootless family with a surreal story, torn between art, religion and madness\\". His mother, a painter, comes from a wealthy Roman family whose members have dedicated their life to art. His father, a businessman and adventurous entrepreneur, comes from a very poor family of Sicilian, French and Spanish descent. At age 5, Marc Ange immigrated to France with his parents. He currently lives between Paris & Los Angeles with his partner Hanane El Moutii.  Career  Marc Ange graduated from the Parisian ESDI design school in 2002. He then left France to regain his native Italy and started a car designer career with major companies in Turin. After a few years in the automotive field, and tired of the monotony associated with creative specialization, Marc Ange decided to return to France in order to create his own studio. In 2008, he founded Bloom Room, an agency dedicated to \\"the creation of extraordinary\\". His detachment from any specialty allows Marc Ange to freely explore the grey area between creative art and design, and therefore develop projects by intertwining conceptual and stylistic values from other artistic universes. Marc Ange's agency Bloom Room was quickly recognized for its ultra-creative nature: he was thus entrusted with the design of objects, spaces or vehicles for brands such as: Louis Vuitton, Mo√´t & Chandon, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Paco Rabanne, Penhaligon's, Peugeot, Citroen, Ferrari, Cassina‚Ä¶ In 2011, he created Chim√®re Edition with Fr√©d√©ric Stouls. Chim√®re Edition is \\"the first contemporary furniture company dedicated to pets\\" according to Le Monde. In 2012, Marc Ange co-founded with Julien Bologna the high-end Champagne brand Le Bal du Hibou.http://www.lebalduhibou.com In 2015, Marc Ange partnered with Raphael Lancrey-Javal to develop his creative agency internationally: the year after, Bloom Room opened a second design office in Downtown Los Angeles. Flaunt Magazine welcomed him with a spread in their \\"Ohlalaland\\" issue, where Marc Ange designed the epitome of a Franco- Angeleno house. In 2017 Marc Ange opens the doors of Bloom Room Los Angeles. In 2017 Marc Ange unveils his first furniture collection for LJ Edition featuring 'Le Refuge', a daybed with giant palm leaves inspired by the Designer's newfound home in California. The piece is exhibited during Milan Design Week on April 2017 at the Mediateca di Brera with Wallpaper* magazine and quickly becomes the most visited exhibit of the fair. In 2018 Marc Ange wins the Wallpaper* award for 'Le Refuge'. In 2019 Marc Ange unveils additional pieces from his furniture collection during Milan Design Week at Palazzo Cusani. His work currently includes the design of Objects, Furniture Pieces and Spaces. He is designing private residences around the world and a new restaurant in the heart of the Medina in Marrakech.  Creative universe  His tumultuous childhood as well his relationship with his speechless brother are the foundation of Marc Ange's artistic universe: both ambivalent and contrasting, where beauty is enhanced by horror, where perfection exists through error, where harmony needs its hazards. Childhood is also very present in Marc Ange's creations, including some deliberate confusion of the real and the unreal, and a sense of naive and nostalgic hope. Cinema is also a great source of inspiration for Marc Ange, because of its ability to unleash all possibilities. The artist and designer is fascinated by the poetry and aesthetics of filmmakers such as Luchino Visconti, Michelangelo Antonioni, Federico Fellini, Alejandro Jodorowsky, Stanley Kubrick and David Lynch.

While growing up in Kitchener, she attended the Suddaby Public School and the Kitchener-Waterloo Collegiate and Vocational School. Kaufman went on to study at the University of Toronto in the Faculty of Household Science and the Methodist Training School, before spending a year at Teachers College in New York. Kaufman first visited Japan in 1909, remaining there for six months during which time she taught and assisted with work at the YWCA. She returned in 1911, spending the next 27 years helping to push the status of Japanese women forward through social and religious education. In 1918, Emma was appointed to the position of Associate Secretary for the Tokyo YWCA. As with all the positions Emma held with the YWCA, she declined any salary. Ms. Kaufman introduced camping as well as other activities. Girls were able to learn democratic principles and cooperation skills. Physical education instructors were brought in from the US which started to raise awareness for Japanese girls physical schooling. The Kaufman family had made their fortune in rubber, and from her inheritance she donated money to the YWCA organization at Kyoto and Nagoya; she built an apartment for Y staff, sponsored 27 young Japanese women for studying abroad, and brought 12 from the USA and Canada to work at the Japanese Y. She returned to Canada before the Second World War and involved herself in the plight of Japanese- Canadians, many of whom were taken from their West Coast homes during the war and transported to camps on the prairies and in Ontario. Kaufman remained an executive committee member of the YWCA after her work in Japan and spent the rest of her life in Toronto, Ontario. Kaufman died in Toronto in 1979 at the age of 97. She was buried at Mount Hope Cemetery in Kitchener, Ontario, in the Kaufman family plot.

The episode was written by Matthew Negrete and directed by Greg Nicotero. The episode focuses on Carol (Melissa McBride) and Morgan (Lennie James) finding refuge and being introduced to a new well-established community called The Kingdom. It marks the debut of King Ezekiel (Khary Payton), his pet Bengal tiger, Shiva, and his right hand man Jerry (Cooper Andrews). Plot Morgan (Lennie James) rescues Carol (Melissa McBride) from a Savior attack, though she has been shot multiple times and falls in and out of consciousness. Morgan takes her to \\"The Kingdom\\", another survivor community, though en route, she experiences visions of a female walker that is inside an abandoned house outside the community. A few days later, Carol is fully conscious, though still weak, and is taken by Morgan to meet King Ezekiel (Khary Payton), the leader of the Kingdom, and his pet Bengal tiger, Shiva. Carol is taken aback by Ezekiel's over-the-top manner, but feigns approval of his hospitality and politely rejects his offer of fruit, stating that pomegranates are not worth the trouble. Later, Carol confides in Morgan that she desires to leave at the first opportunity. As Carol recovers, Morgan is invited by Ezekiel on a secret mission with a small group to collect eight wild pigs, let them feed on walkers, and slaughter them as their current offering to the Saviors. At the arranged meeting, there is open hostility between the Saviors and Kingdom, but the Saviors accept the pigs and demand produce for their next offering or threaten to kill one of the Kingdom's men. Ezekiel, impressed with Morgan's performance in this mission, asks him to train one of his men, Benjamin (Logan Miller), in staff combat skills. While training, Benjamin reveals that Ezekiel continues to meet the Saviors' offerings as he does not believe the Kingdom can beat them. Some time later, Carol attempts to collect some provisions from the Kingdom's stores before she leaves, but Ezekiel catches her. He tells her he knew she was feigning her approval but is curious about her strong survival abilities. Carol explains some of her past, leading Ezekiel to reveal his own \\"King\\" is an act; he was a former zookeeper and amateur actor, but took on the King persona to give his people someone to follow and know there is good in the world. Carol still wishes to leave and Ezekiel suggests that she can stay nearby in the abandoned house, so that she could \\"go and not go\\". Morgan escorts her to the house, and she clears it of the walker she had seen earlier. Later, she gets a visit from Ezekiel and Shiva; he offers her a pomegranate.

The episode was written by Angela Kang and directed by Alrick Riley. The episode focuses on the Saviors living in an impressive community, the Sanctuary, that seems to have it all. Concurrently, Daryl (Norman Reedus) is held prisoner and psychologically tortured by Dwight (Austin Amelio), a ruthless but reluctant member of the Saviors and one of Negan's (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) top lieutenants, who forms a hostile rivalry with Daryl. Plot Under Negan's (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) orders, Daryl (Norman Reedus) is taken to the Saviors' home, the Sanctuary, and locked in a dark cell, to be converted to join the Saviors by Dwight (Austin Amelio). Dwight feeds Daryl only dog food sandwiches and forces him to listen to the song \\"Easy Street\\" played through the walls. Dwight shows that if Daryl refuses to join the Saviors, he could end up like other prisoners, who have become walkers wandering in a fenced off area. Daryl attempts an escape one day when he finds his cell unlocked, but this is revealed to be a test by Negan of his loyalty. Negan threatens to smash Daryl's head with \\"Lucille\\", his bat, but Daryl doesn't flinch. Negan is impressed and leaves him be, though the other Saviors beat him up and return him to his cell. Later, Negan taunts Dwight about his relationship with Sherry (Christine Evangelista) and his loyalty. To try to get into good favor with Negan, Dwight sets off to capture a Savior who has decided to leave. He finds the man, Gordon (Michael Scialabba), who begs to be killed rather than returned to Sanctuary. Dwight, after some thought, kills Gordon, and returns to Sanctuary to spend time with Sherry. He later visits Daryl and tapes a gruesome Polaroid photo of Glenn's mutilated body on the wall, blaming Daryl for his friend's death. Daryl breaks down into tears. Dwight believes he has broken Daryl's spirit and takes him to meet Negan. Negan explains to Daryl how Dwight became one of his top men. Dwight, Sherry and her sister Tina used to be part of the Sanctuary workforce, earning \\"points\\" for goods. However, Tina suffered from diabetes and fell behind on points. Tina agreed to marry Negan to keep her supply of medicine, but she, Dwight and Sherry stole the medicine and ran away. Following Tina's death, Dwight and Sherry returned, asking Negan for forgiveness and sparing their lives, with Sherry offering herself in marriage to Negan. Negan agreed, but only after using a hot iron to burn half of Dwight's face in punishment. Negan then explains to Daryl that he too can become one of his men if he answers one question: \\"Who are you?\\" Daryl refuses to answer with \\"Negan\\" and instead provides his own name, defying Negan. Negan orders Dwight to return him to his cell. Dwight yells at Daryl for jeopardizing his life, but Daryl responds that, like Dwight, he was thinking of someone else at the time that he decided whether or not to obey Negan. Reception =Critical reception= \\"The Cell\\" received generally positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a 74% with an average rating of 7.04 out of 10, based on 34 reviews. The site's consensus reads: The Walking Dead delivers another character-driven episode in \\"The Cell,\\" which successfully delves deeper into the world of Negan and his cronies, even if its attempts to humanize a villain achieve somewhat mixed results. Critic Ed Power of The Daily Telegraph praised the episode: \\"along comes an episode such as The Cell and you are reminded that at its finest the Walking Dead is one of the most quietly dazzling things on television.\\" Kelly Lawler of USA Today reviewed the episode negatively, saying, \\"The Walking Dead spent its third episode physically and psychologically torturing yet another of its best and most beloved characters. And why did they do it? Because they had nothing else to do to push this tired and pointless Negan storyline along.\\" =Ratings= The episode received a 5.7 rating in the key 18-49 demographic with 11.72 million total viewers. It is at the time the lowest rating the show has had since \\"Dead Weight\\" from season four. =Music= The song featured on the episode \\"Easy Street\\" by The Collapsable Hearts Club charted at number 92 on the UK Singles Chart a week after the episode aired.

While he is generally understood to be part of the alt-right * * he describes himself as part of the \\"new right\\" and some have claimed he is part of the \\"alt-lite\\". Cernovich has been a regular host of The Alex Jones Show on InfoWars. He became a blogger in the 2000s, focusing on anti-feminist themes. He gained notice within the manosphere where he gave advice as a \\"pickup artist\\" and made a number of inflammatory comments about dating and sexual assault, notably claiming that date rape \\"does not exist\\". He created a website, Danger and Play, in 2011; it was first known for his men's rights postings. During the 2016 US presidential election campaign, Cernovich adapted his website as a political blog, advocating in favor of Republican Donald Trump and promoting conspiracy theories about Democrat Hillary Clinton. Cernovich is known for his promotion of fake news, conspiracy theories, and smear campaigns. He helped spread Pizzagate, which falsely claimed that John Podesta and other high- ranking Democratic Party officials were involved in a child-sex ring. Cernovich has falsely accused various political opponents of being pedophiles or supporting pedophilia. He succeeded in getting Sam Seder fired from MSNBC with such an allegation, but the reporter was reinstated when Cernovich's claim about him was revealed to be a falsehood. Early life Mike Cernovich is the son of Mike Cernovich (1927-2020)Legacy.‚ÄúShirley A Cernovich.‚Äù Legacy.com. (Retrieved September 17, 2010.) and Shirley Brew (1930-2013).Quad City Times ‚ÄúMike Cernovich.‚Äù Legacy.com. (Retrieved September 17, 2010.) Cernovich's family were devout Christians in the farming town of Kewanee, Illinois. The family was poor, and his mother suffered from mental illness and was treated for a period of time in an institution. Cernovich graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy from the University of Illinois at Springfield in 2001. He graduated with a Juris Doctor from Pepperdine University's School of Law in 2004. Career =Blogs and anti-feminist writings= In 2004, Cernovich started a legal weblog entitled 'Crime & Federalism,' and his blog was selected for syndication by American Lawyer Media. (Listing Crime & Federalism among ALM's Legal Blog Watch on Law.com.) In his early writings, Cernovich focused on antifeminism, men's empowerment, and how to meet women. The title of Danger and Play came from a quote by Friedrich Nietzsche, \\"The true man wants two things: danger and play. For that reason he wants woman, as the most dangerous plaything.\\" Cernovich started the website in 2011 following his divorce. In 2014, Cernovich promoted Gamergate, a controversy during which several women in the video game industry were targeted by Internet trolls. He goaded leading women with tweets such as \\"Who cares about breast cancer and rape? Not me.\\" In 2016, he tweeted, \\"Women love aggressive men, but only if they are alpha males.\\" According to The New York Times in April 2017, Cernovich has long been criticized for arguing that date rape is a \\"harmful concept for men and women.\\" The Southern Poverty Law Center has identified him as a male supremacist. =Use of social media= Cernovich became influential on social media, initially as part of the manosphere movement. He later helped to shape far-right narratives in the United States. He falsely claimed during the 2016 United States presidential election that Hillary Clinton had a \\"seizure disorder\\" and Parkinson's disease. By September his #HillarysHealth hashtag had gotten 240,000 page views and had become a national trending topic on Twitter. During the month of September, Cernovich's tweets were seen more than 100 million times. Cernovich frequently calls his adversaries \\"cucks\\", a variant of the alt-right slang word cuckservative, a pejorative term for conservatives who supposedly betray conservative social values. In reference to this, he has written, \\"To beat a person, you lower his or her social status. Logic is pointless.\\" Cernovich admits to sometimes using trolling tactics, which he says he uses to build his brand rather than for his own amusement. In October 2016 Cernovich said: \\"The left likes to talk about power structures, right? Well, the media still thinks of itself as speaking truth to power. What they don't realize is that someone like me is perceived as the new Fourth Estate.\\" He also said: \\"Maybe they should check their structural privilege.\\" The \\"paternalistic\\" media, he said, was giving way to a more democratic one. \\"It makes journalists crazy, because they used to be in control. They can't control people anymore. Everyone has a voice now.\\" In November 2017, Cernovich spread misinformation linking the Sutherland Springs church shooting to Antifa. =On sexual harassment and pedophilia= In October 2016, he wrote, \\"Lying about being in love to sleep with someone isn't rape. Getting played isn't rape. Regret isn't rape. Thinking, 'I might have been date raped,' means you weren't raped.\\" In mid-November 2017, Cernovich offered $10,000 for information about congressional sexual harassment settlements. The next week, he sent documents concerning a case settled by Representative John Conyers (D-Michigan) to BuzzFeed, which vetted them and reported on them. Cernovich helped to promote the false Pizzagate conspiracy theory in 2016 through his blog posts. He asserts his belief that there are active child sex rings in Washington, D.C. He has accused his opponents of being pedophiles on many occasions. In a YouTube video he said that most people employed by the news media and \\"every A-list actor\\" in Hollywood were also pedophiles. Freelance journalist Jake Offenhartz said that Cernovich and his followers had inappropriately used a photograph at a rally of Columbia University activists in New York City on October 30, 2017 to imply falsely that leftist protestors were marching to advocate pedophilia. In December 2017, Cernovich hosted an \\"Ask Me Anything\\" on Reddit, regarded as a failure by several media outlets, which was dominated by users mocking him and asking questions about the rape allegations against him, his advice to men to expose their genitalia and masturbate in front of women who are unwilling to engage in sexual acts, and a purported encounter with a male-to-female transgender individual in Thailand (which Cernovich denied). A few days later, he announced his intention to retire from social media, but reversed the decision within hours. In July 2018, Cernovich dug up historical tweets by director James Gunn of Disney, who was a vocal critic of Trump. Gunn had joked about rape and pedophilia; Disney fired Gunn for these tweets. In March 2019, Gunn was reinstated by the company and directed Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. Cernovich has posted multiple provocative tweets about rape, including the comment: \\"A whore will let her friend ruin your life with a false rape case. So why should I care when women are raped?\\" =Political statements about Donald Trump and others= During the 2016 United States presidential campaign, Cernovich saw Donald Trump as a kindred spirit. According to Politico, during the 2016 campaign and early period of the Trump administration, Cernovich was an \\"indefatigable Trump cheerleader\\", and believed that he and kindred activists would have a major influence on the Republican Party. By 2018 Cernovich had become \\"increasingly critical\\" of Trump, and less politically active. He refocused his efforts on his \\"Gorilla Mindset\\" lifestyle-coaching practice. In September 2018, he tweeted, \\"There's no Wall. She's not locked up. But Flynn got fired and sent to wolves. And Sauadi Arabia sold weapons of murder. I give zero f-cks about Republicans losing the House.\\" Cernovich complimented democratic socialist (and Trump critic) Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on her primary election upset of New York Congressman Joe Crowley: \\"She just slaughtered fucking Crowley, just slaughtered the machine, and now she's like the It girl... I like to watch peak human achievement.\\" Cernovich criticized the Trump administration's 2018 missile strikes against Syria, which also divided the president's political base. Afterward Cernovich announced that he would shift to writing about \\"philosophy\\" and more esoteric content. He claimed to have felt a \\"cosmic\\" \\"shift in energy\\" that only \\"high-consciousness people\\" could apprehend. He also elaborated on his past use of mind-altering drugs and several times referred to reality as a \\"simulation\\". In 2016, Cernovich criticized Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for speaking at a gender-segregated mosque. =Court Cases= Jeffrey Epstein Cernovich and the Miami Herald joined Alan Dershowitz (who filed for exoneration) in filing, on journalistic grounds, to have the documents about the 2017 defamation settlement of Giuffre v. Maxwell unsealed. After the judge dismissed their request, the matter was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which vacated that order July 2 and ordered the summary judgment papers unsealed. =Conflict with Sam Seder= Cernovich promoted an attack on Sam Seder by publishing a joke Tweet of Seder's from 2009 saying \\"Don't care re Polanski, but I hope if my daughter is ever raped it is by an older truly talented man w/ a great sense of mise en scene,\\" claiming that the tweet proved Seder tacitly endorsed Polanski's sex crime. He then approached multiple journalists and news outlets, including MSNBC, to break the story. Seder found out about the brewing controversy the same evening en route to a supermarket after being contacted by MSNBC Senior Vice President of Communications Errol Cockfield Jr. asking him to explain the tweet. Seder replied to Cockfield in an email explaining the point being made in the tweet and the context in which he wrote it. Seder also provided other tweets supporting his claim. The next day, on November 29, 2017, Seder received a voicemail from Cockfield indicating MSNBC's upper management was seriously considering cutting ties with him. Seder responded that MSNBC was making a mistake and that, \\"there's no story here.\\" Seder further warned Cockfield that if they moved forward with the termination, \\"You guys are going to be the story.\\" Seder also requested a formal termination email. Seder never received the email, leading him to believe that this employment status was still undecided. On Sunday, December 3, 2017, Seder was notified by Jon Levine of TheWrap that they had been contacted by MSNBC who had decided to terminate Seder's contract and were about to break the story through their own publication. Seder immediately sent Cockfield an inquiry regarding his status. Cockfield, at first, did not have a status update but later confirmed MSNBC was, in fact, dropping Seder. Firing The next day, on December 4, 2017, TheWrap announced that MSNBC had elected to sever ties with Seder by not renewing his contract (due to expire in February 2018) due to the controversial tweet. Seder defended the tweet by pointing out that, taken in context of the current events around the time he posted it, it was a satiric response to a petition urging Polanski's release from detention in Switzerland because of his stature as an artist. That he was, in fact, mocking Polanski's apologists. After news of the termination broke, Cernovich released a Twitter video celebrating his triumph. By then, Seder noted that advertisers on The Majority Report with Sam Seder podcast were also being contacted and pressured by Cernovich and his followers to cut ties with the show over the tweet. In response, Seder launched a GoFundMe campaign to help maintain funding for the show in the face of potential loss of advertising revenue. In an episode of the podcast titled, \\"I'm Under Attack By the Nazi Alt-Right\\", Seder said, \\"this smear involves the willful misinterpretation of a tweet that I posted in 2009\\" and that he will \\"never be ashamed of criticizing those who would excuse the predation of women or girls.\\" Seder revealed plans to use a portion of the GoFundMe proceeds to produce a three-minute video educating people on Cernovich's tactics. According to Seder, Cernovich's ploy had been retribution for his frequent criticism of US President Donald Trump as well as Republican Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore who was accused of sexual assault. Further, Seder chided MSNBC's decision to terminate his employment concluding, \\"I think they're afraid of those people.\\" The news of Seder's dismissal prompted an almost immediate backlash. Over 12,000 people signed a petition protesting Seder's termination, arguing that Cernovich had acted in malice and was deliberately mischaracterizing the tweet. AV Club wrote that \\"MSNBC has now fully bought into that smear campaign ... whose openly stated goal is the destruction of news outlets just like it through the use of blatantly manipulative trolling techniques.\\" Mother Jones rebuked MSNBC for capitulating \\"to the demands of a lunatic conservative.\\" HuffPost chided that Cernovich was now MSNBC's new \\"De Facto Ombudsman.\\" MSNBC primetime anchor Chris Hayes tweeted, \\"The entire culture and our politics are now dominated by people who have weaponized bad faith and shamelessness.\\" Rehiring There was considerable dissent within MSNBC over Seder's termination. Some employees expressed concerns that his firing would encourage other far-right personalities to launch similar smear campaigns. A senior MSNBC employee characterized the capitulation as \\"really weak\\" and \\"pathetic\\". MSNBC's management itself was unsettled by the celebratory reaction from the far-right. On December 7, 2017, MSNBC decided to reverse their decision to terminate Seder's employment. MSNBC President Phil Griffin said in a statement, \\"Sometimes you just get one wrong, and that's what happened here. We made our initial decision for the right reasons‚Äîbecause we don't consider rape to be a funny topic to be joked about. But we've heard the feedback, and we understand the point Sam was trying to make in that tweet was actually in line with our values, even though the language was not. Sam will be welcome on our air going forward.\\" In response, Seder issued a statement while accepting his job back: Columbia Journalism Review cited the incident as an example of a broader pattern of far-right media personalities using online smear campaigns to get mainstream journalists fired. Cernovich, who also promoted the Pizzagate conspiracy theory, insisted \\"date rape doesn't exist\\" and was himself arrested for rape (though subsequently pleading guilty to battery), acknowledged that \\"some are saying Seder was making a joke or being sarcastic.\\" However, he still insisted he didn't misrepresent the tweet and that he simply \\"reported on what [Seder] said.\\" He later admitted that the whole incident was a stunt while claiming victory explaining, retroactively, it was meant to bring attention to what he perceived was a double standard and a lack of \\"diversity of viewpoint\\" in the media. =Books= In 2015, Cernovich wrote Gorilla Mindset: How to Control Your Thoughts and Emotions, Improve Your Health and Fitness, Make More Money and Live Life on Your Terms. The book became a best seller on Amazon. Cernovich described the book as a \\"book about embracing your gorilla nature to find dominance and power, but you will see that this primarily means power over yourself, not others.\\" In 2016, Cernovich wrote two books. In the first, Danger & Play: Essays on Embracing Masculinity, he states \\"We are apes. In the jungle, size is king. Women like big men. That‚Äôs just evolution.\\" The second book is titled Maga Mindset: Making You and America Great Again. In 2018, Cernovich partnered with Scooter Downey and Jon Du Toit to write Hoaxed: Everything They Told You Is a Lie, which was also made into a documentary of the same name. The documentary was listed on the Amazon platform before being removed without comment in 2020. Cernovich stated, \\"I believe the film was banned from Amazon because there is a sequence discussing Jeff Bezos and Amazon's $600 million contract with the CIA. Bezos does not want the public reminded of that.\\"  Views  Cernovich calls himself an \\"American Nationalist\\". He advocates IQ-testing for all immigrants and limiting those who can enter, and promotes ending federal funding of universities.Schreckinger, Ben (January/February 2017). \\"The Alt- Right Comes to Washington\\". Politico Magazine. Retrieved: February 21, 2017. He opposes the two-party system and says that his support for Trump is not based on public policy. Cernovich has been classified by some reporters as being part of the alt-right movement. He has denied this, preferring the label \\"new right\\". In his study of the alt-right, the political scientist George Hawley argued that Cernovich \\"might be properly labelled\\" as \\"alt-lite\\". Commentator Angela Nagle described Cernovich as a \\"major figure in the alt- light milieu\\". In April 2017, Cernovich promoted a conspiracy theory that the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack in Syria was a hoax funded by an American financier. Cernovich has advocated for a universal basic income within the United States, claiming that \\"Conservatism is on the way out\\". Interviewed on 60 Minutes in March 2017, he advocated for single-payer healthcare, saying if \\"a large swath of the company, or country, are suffering, then I think that we owe it to all Americans to do right by them and to help them out.\\" = White genocide = Cernovich believes in the white genocide conspiracy theory. He has said that it is real in South Africa. He said that he initially joined the alt-right after realizing that \\"tolerance only went one way and diversity is code for white genocide\\". He later deleted several tweets referring to the concept. Other responses In August 2017, the Anti-Defamation League accused Cernovich of commissioning and publishing a \\"blatantly anti-Semitic cartoon\\" by Ben Garrison as part of a campaign against President Donald Trump's national security adviser.  Personal life  Cernovich was arrested and charged with rape in 2003. The rape charges were dismissed, but he was ordered to perform community service for misdemeanor battery. His record was later expunged. Cernovich married his first wife as a law student in 2003. He said the marriage was \\"ruined by feminist indoctrination\\". He has admitted to having cheated on his first wife and bragged about it, sometimes publishing articles online that offered tips on how to cheat on partners. An attorney for a Silicon Valley firm, his first wife earned millions of dollars from an initial public offering of stock. She filed for divorce in 2011, and Cernovich received what he has described as a \\"seven-figure sum\\" in the settlement. In 2012, Cernovich married Shauna Ghofranian, the daughter of Iranian immigrants.Editors, ‚ÄúShauna Cernovich ‚Äì Bio, Facts and Profile of Mike Cernovich‚Äôs Wife.‚Äù AnswersAfrica.

He fulfilled this requirement because by 1800 records show that the area was fully cleared and cultivated with ten acres of wheat and twenty acres of maize.

Atmospheric effects At these high frequencies, the short wavelengths give the radiation a very directional quality, similar to visible light. Many molecules possess rotational and vibrational states excited by very specific wavelengths in this band, thus the atmospheric gases such as oxygen, water vapor, carbon dioxide and nitrogen can absorb, and be excited causing variable beam attenuation effects dependent on meteorological and atmospheric conditions.

The following year she relocated to Kitchener, Ontario where she advanced to Technical Assistant of the lab, becoming the first woman in the industry to obtain the type of position. Haviland worked with rubber compounds and synthetic materials identifying the best formula or 'recipes' for rubber tires. Her work was particularly important during World War II when a shortage of natural rubber supplies hindered regular production schedules and processes requiring new approaches to tire production in order to support troops overseas. By 1955 Haviland was working with roughly 1,000 different types of rubber compounds suitable for different situations and conditions. She retired from the company 1960.

In 367, the Roman Emperor Valens attacked the Thervingi (a Gothic people) north of the Danube river. However, he was unable to hit them directly, because apparently the bulk of the Goths retreated to the Montes Serrorum. Marcellinus says that Valens could not find anyone to fight with (nullum inveniret quem superare poterat vel terrere) and even implies that all of them fled, horror-struck, to the mountains (omnes formidine perciti... montes petivere Serrorum). It was described as only accessible to \\"exceedingly\\" familiar with the surroundings, thus the Roman troops were unable to achieve anything. Dispute The mountain was probably located in the Southeastern Carpathians. Matei Cazacu (1972) tried to precisely locate it to the Siriul mountain range that divides Transylvania from Wallachia - the BuzƒÉu Mountains. Wanke (1990) was sceptical to Cazacu's attempt. There were attempts to etymologically derive Siriu from Romanian, Hungarian and Turkish language. The toponym has been connected to the Sarmatian tribe Serri settled north of the Caucasus, mentioned by Pliny the Elder (23‚Äì79) in Naturalis Historia. Other considered an existence of another same-named Dacian tribe because were recorded Thracian words with the same root. Although by some it seems unlikely, the majority of scholars deem the Sarmatian tribal connection as the most credible explanation because it is also similar to other ancient names of the Carpathians, Sarmatian Mountains and Alpes Bastarnicae, the fact Marcellinus reported about the Caucaland referring to the Carpathians, making Montes Serrorum a made-up geographical name. Konstantin Jireƒçek (1854‚Äì1918) also connected the toponym with Pliny's Serri, but according to him they were \\"Caucasian Serbs\\". Slovene anthropologist Niko ≈Ωupaniƒç (1876‚Äì1961) treated the toponym as evidence of \\"Serb presence in Dacia\\", and this view was supported by Ivo Vukcevich (2001), but the fringe theory in turn was discredited by Florin Curta for being based on a \\"dubious etymology\\". The toponym Montes Serrorum in another version of the manuscript is written as Montes Succorum, however, although the root \\"suc-\\" is reported in several toponyms of the time in the region, the form is a result of writing error.

This sculpture was a particular challenge to the artist due to his preference to portray his subjects in great detail, and the fact that Balzac was already dead. Rodin then started to research about the life and times of his subject, only to find, according to Kenneth Clark, that he had been a short, fat and unremarkable-looking man. With this difficulty, Rodin aimed instead to represent Balzac's persona rather than his physical likeness. Instead of the agreed-upon eighteen months, Rodin spent seven years making different studies, both nude and non-nude, only to present his final plaster in 1898 at a Salon in Champ de Mars with great disapproval by the Societ√®. Disillusioned with this result, Rodin decided to install the plaster at his house in Meudon. Only in 1939 was a full-size cast put at the crossroads of boulevard Raspail and boulevard du Montparnasse, also known as carrefour Vavin, in the 6th arrondissement of Paris. Three sculptures of Balzac made by Rodin Unlike other studies and the final version of the monument, Balzac in the Robe of a Dominican Monk shows the author fully clothed with the traditional habit of the Dominican order--a simple cloak with a belt-- standing in a rock-like structure and with both hands explicitly shown. It is considered by some later critics as one of the best sculptures made by the French artist.

Hepworth signed Preece's name to many of Hepworth's paintings, even after Preece's death. Early life Hepworth was born in 1894 in Leicester, Leicestershire, the oldest of two daughters of Adela n√©e Jarvis (1865‚Äì1954) and Alfred James Hepworth (1859‚Äì1930), the owner of a hosiery warehouse. She also had a younger brother, Eric Pachley Hepworth (1897‚Äì1898).Dorothy Mary Hepworth, 1911 England Census, Leicestershire, Leicester, South Leicester ‚Äì Ancestry.com She met Patricia Preece at the Slade School of Fine Art in 1917, and graduated from there with first class honours in 1919. The two became lovers. While still a student, Hepworth began exhibiting her work. After graduation, she spent four years with Preece in Paris, where Hepworth studied at the Acad√©mie Colarossi and Preece was a pupil of Andr√© Lhote. They returned to England in 1925, where they relocated to Cookham for Hepworth's health. The two received financial help from Hepworth's wealthy father to purchase a house there, but Hepworth's father lost his fortune in the stock market crash of 1929. Hepworth's father died in 1930, and afterwards Hepworth and Preece experienced difficulty making the mortgage payments on their home. Preece and Hepworth were closeted about their relationship as was common at that time, and sometimes claimed to be sisters. Career The grave of Hepworth and Preece in Cookham Parish churchyard in 2018 It is believed that many, if not all, of the much-accoladed paintings of Preece were created by Hepworth. Preece attributed the paintings to herself, with the consent of Hepworth, who was shy and preferred not to appear in public. Hepworth's work attributed to Preece was exhibited in London at the Royal Academy of Arts, the Warren Gallery, Maddox Street, in 1928 and the Lefevre Gallery, King Street, in 1936. Some of the paintings were purchased by Kenneth Clark, Virginia Woolf and Augustus John, among others. Until 1996, it was believed that the two collaborated on many of the works. Evidence for Hepworth's creating them herself comes from diaries that the two shared, where Preece admits to having had little hand in the creation of the paintings. Later life and death Hepworth and Preece maintained their relationship after Preece's 1937 marriage to the painter Stanley Spencer, who was obsessed with Preece. Preece took Hepworth on the honeymoon, while Spencer stayed at home working on a painting. Preece and Hepworth continued to live together during the marriage to Spencer, and after Preece gained control of Spencer's finances they evicted him from his house in 1938 to rent it out. Preece refused to divorce her hapless husband.\\"Sir Stanley Spencer Stands Alone\\", BBC World Service, 14 July 2001, accessed 14 September 2007 Hepworth remained Preece's companion and lover until the latter's death in 1968 at the age of 74.Patricia Ruby Vivian Spencer, England & Wales, National Probate Calendar (Index of Wills and Administrations), 1858‚Äì1995 (1966) ‚Äì Ancestry.com Hepworth continued to paint and still signed her work as Preece until her own death in 1978.

These specialized psychologists study a variety of psychological abilities that deplete as aging occurs such as memory, learning capabilities, and coordination. Geriatric psychologists work with elderly clients to conduct the diagnosis, study, and treatment of certain mental illnesses in a variety of workplace settings. Common areas of practice include loneliness in old age, depression, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and Parkinson's disease. Geriatric Psychology vs. Geriatric Psychiatry Geriatric Psychology Geriatric psychology is based upon the study of mental functions with aging. The psychologist's purpose is to observe how the neurological and physiological process of an elderly adults brain affects their behaviors in daily life. When a psychologist is specialized in geriatrics they provide care for declining brain functions to make life better. Geriatric Psychiatry Geriatric psychiatry is a subspecialty of psychiatry dealing with the research, diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders in the later stages of life.Barraclough, J.; Gill, D. (1996). Hughes' outline of modern psychiatry. (4th ed.) New York: John Wiley & Sons. Harkins, S. (16 April 2003). \\"Glossary of Terms\\". Retrieved 2019-04-01. The field composes of the diagnosis, treatment, and management of areas such as depression, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. A geriatric psychiatrist is also a licensed doctor that can prescribe medications for elderly patients. Psychiatrists require education and degree from a medical school. \\"Psychiatry vs. Psychology: What's the Difference?\\". www.careerprofiles.info. Retrieved 2019-04-01. Role of the Geriatric Psychologist A geriatric psychologist specializes in the treatment of the elderly. This treatment can include mental health problems or aid in understanding and coping with the aging process. In order to become a geriatric psychologist, one must obtain a doctoral degree in psychology and specialize in adult development and aging. Once the degree is obtained, geriatric psychologists will usually work in hospitals, mental health clinics, rehab centers, nursing homes, and research centers. Geriatric psychologists spend most of their workday addressing mental health issues in older adults and counseling those that need it. They also aid in the diagnosis of age- related problems. In order to check for mental health issues, geriatric psychologists will conduct clinical interviews, neuropsychological tests and behavioral observations. History Geriatric psychology began in 1978 with a spike in interest in mental health and the effects of aging. There was a slow increase in the number of aging adults in the U.S. population. There was a small group of 11 people who met together to talk about late-life mental health needs and the field of geriatrics. This meeting later created the American Association of Geriatric Psychology (AAGP). As time has gone on the small group has turned into a very large group of people dedicated to the well being of the aging population. Common Areas of Practice =Loneliness in Elderly People= Loneliness is an emotional response to the process of social isolation. It typically entails the feelings of anxiousness due to the lack of social connectedness or communication with others. Research has shown that loneliness has negative impacts on biological, cognitive and immune functioning. It is prevalent throughout all age groups from childhood to old age. Nurses and other individuals who work in association with the elderly learn the various theories of loneliness, as they may need to implement these perspectives into enhancing the lives of their patients. They are particularly problematic in old age due to the changes an individual goes through such as decreasing economic stability and resources, changes in family structures, reduced social communication and the death of a relative or spouse. The most researched outcomes of loneliness are depression and cardiovascular health. Lonely individuals have found to have increased arterial stiffness, decreased blood circulation and associated with elevated blood pressure.Hawkley, L. C., & Cacioppo, J. T. (2013). Social connectedness and health. Human bonding: The science of affectional ties, 343-364. Social isolation and feelings of loneliness are also major risk factors for poor cognitive and physical health. A poor sense of social connectedness has a negative impact on neural processing and cognitive abilities. In a 4-year prospective study of initially dementia-free old-age adults, the risk of Alzheimer's was more than twice in lonely individuals compared to non-lonely. The study concluded that loneliness led to lower cognitive abilities and a rapid decline in cognition during the 4-year course. = Depression = Depression in the elderly community can have severe consequences, which is why it is an important public health problem and research area. Older adults facing this debilitating condition are less likely to endorse affective symptoms and are more likely to instead display cognitive changes, somatic symptoms, and loss of interest than are younger adults. It is comorbid with ‚Äúmorbidity, increased risk of suicide, decreased physical, cognitive and social functioning, and greater self-neglect‚Äù, all of which are associated with an increase in mortality. Risk factors A common pathway to depression in older adults may consist of predisposing risks as well as the life changes experienced in old age. The development of late-life depression has several risk factors that likely compose of \\"cognitive diathesis, age- associated neurobiological changes, genetic vulnerabilities, and stressful life events\\". Insomnia is often an overlooked factor in late-life depression. Impacts of sleep deprivation are reduced glucose tolerance, elevated evening cortisol levels, and increased sympathetic nervous system activity. Sleep quality at an old age is just as important as sleep duration to avoid lack of sleep. Research shows that feelings of loneliness and depression can result in poor sleep quality and daytime dysfunctions. These daytime impairments include physical and intellectual fatigue, irritability, and low cognitive abilities. Dunietz, G. L., Swanson, L. M., Jansen, E. C., Chervin, R. D., O‚ÄôBrien, L. M., Lisabeth, L. D., & Braley, T. J. (2018). Key insomnia symptoms and incident pain in older adults: direct and mediated pathways through depression and anxiety. Sleep, 41(9), zsy125. =Dementia= Dementia is a variety of symptoms that apply to a decline in mental ability, not a specific disease. Geriatric psychologists work with dementia by aiding in the diagnosis of this disease. This is done through various cognitive tests and assessments. They will also look at research and potential treatment for dementia. =Alzheimer's disease= Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia, accounting for 60-80 percent of dementia cases. Similar to dementia, a geriatric psychologist's role regarding Alzheimer's disease is the assessment, treatment, and research of the disease. =Vascular dementia= Vascular dementia, the second most common type of dementia, is the result of a stroke. A geriatric psychologist aids in the assessment, diagnosing, treatment, and research of vascular dementia. =Parkinson's disease= Parkinson's disease is a movement disorder that has symptoms like tremors, slowing down, stiffness, and impaired balance. A geriatric psychologist's role for those with Parkinson's disease would be helping the person diagnosed deal with the stress they may encounter regarding Parkinson's Disease. Since it is not a brain disorder, the geriatric psychologist would not help with diagnosing or the treatment of the disease.

Biography Zingg was born and raised in New York City. Eventually he learned the guitar and spent about ten years doing the NY club scene, at times backing Shawn Colvin and Lucy Kaplansky. He also did some Broadway production and session work. Eventually, Zingg started playing in a band headed by keyboard player and vocalist Jeff Young. In 1989, Donald Fagen signed up Young and his band, which included Zingg, initially as the rhythm section for what eventually became Fagen's (along with his future wife Libby Titus) New York Rock and Soul Revue. Zingg can be heard on the 1991 album The New York Rock and Soul Revue: Live at the Beacon, which also features Michael McDonald, Phoebe Snow, and Boz Scaggs, among others. The NY Rock & Soul gigs led to Walter Becker coming to New York and joining the Revue in the summer of 1992. Then, Fagen and Becker decided to hit the road, touring as Steely Dan, with Zingg joining them on the tour as a lead guitarist and music director for about two years. Others joining this \\"Steely Dan Orchestra\\" were Warren Bernhardt on keyboards, Peter Erskine on drums, and Tom Barney on bass. In 1995, Steely Dan released a live album entitled Alive in America that was recorded during the 1993-1994 tours, with Zingg soloing on \\"Green Earrings\\"http://somethingelsereviews.com/2013/05/05/steely-dan-sunday-green- earrings-live-1995/ and \\"Third World Man\\".

Early life  Welsh was born to a family of modest means who lived at 318 South Exeter Street in the Little Italy section of Baltimore City. His father traveled extensively, and Welsh was raised predominantly by his mother. His mother hailed from a musical family and was an accomplished pianist. From an early age, Welsh exhibited an exceptional talent for music. Recognizing this talent, his mother contracted with a private tutor from whom Welsh learned to play the trumpet.Stapleton, R. The History and Genealogy of the Welsh Family, Genealogy Publishing, 2006. His lessons were discontinued at the age of seventeen when he was drafted into the US Army for service in the European theater during World War II. Welsh saw combat under General Patton in the Battle of the Bulge. He was wounded in action and returned to the United States before the end of the war for convalescence. He maintained contact with his comrades in arms for many decades after the war. Welsh remained active in military circles and served as Senior Vice Commander of the Baltimore section of the League of Disabled American Veterans.Archives of the Disabled American Veterans, Baltimore, 1981.  Musical career  Welsh briefly attended law school upon his return from military service. However, finding that a career in law was not his calling, he dropped out of law school to form his own orchestra. He became an orchestral conductor in the tradition of the American Big Band genre, naming his group The Versatilles. The Versatilles were a fixture in the Baltimore ballroom musical scene from the 1950s through the 1970s. Welsh's local fame as a musician earned him a position as trumpeter for the Post Call at the Pimlico Racecourse. McCary, A. Big Band Jazz. Barrie and Jenkins Publishers, London, 1974.  Pimlico Racecourse  Welsh began working at the Pimlico Racecourse as trumpeter for the Post Call in 1957. He developed a keen interest in all things equestrian and a knack for choosing winning horses. Welsh's unusual ability to pick winning horses did not go unnoticed. He earned numerous celebrity clients as an oddsmaker and turf accountant. Welsh served as private turf accountant to Jackie Gleason, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, along with various senators and congressmen who frequented the racecourse. Welsh worked at the Pimlico Racecourse for three decades and developed a reputation for discretion and honesty. His expertise was sought at Laurel Park, Timonium Racecourse, and Prince George's Park on numerous occasions. Welsh was a close friend and colleague of Jimmy the Greek and served as his principle liaison at the Pimlico Racecourse. Welsh correctly predicted the Triple Crown winners in 1973, 1977, and 1978. In 1979, while working at Pimlico, Welsh lost his balance and fell from a high stool. The fall induced a cardiac arrhythmia that forced him to retire.  Personal life  Welsh married Bessie Tangires, the daughter of a Greek restaurateur. The couple had two sons. Welsh died in 2003 at the age of seventy-eight due to complications of a stroke. He was buried at the Riverside National Cemetery in Riverside, California.

It is considered the first by Rodin in which life is represented over the grace pervading the academic circles and aesthetic of the time. Rodin made a first model of this piece on plaster in 1864, but lost the back of the bust. Later, in 1880, a second model, this time in bronze, was cast and is the surviving cast of the piece. A marble copy was made by L√©on Fourquet.  History  In 1863, Rodin adapted a stable to become his atelier, where he worked with an amateur model by the name of \\"Bibi\\" to make his first model of the mask. According to Rainer Maria Rilke the man before Rodin \\"a man with a calm demeanor and face. It had the face of a live man which, when explored, was full of agitation and disorder\\". Description and influence The sculpture was cast on bronze with black, brown and green patina. It has a 12.5 x 15.1 x 15.3 cm (3.1 x 3.8 x 3.8 in) base, where Rodin's signature can be found. Even though there is a clear influence by other works at the Louvre, this mask represents the fidelity on contours that is characteristic of Rodin, made clear in the profound wrinkles and severe facial expression. This work was crucial in Rodin's unique aesthetical development. According to the artist himself: \\"That mask determined all my future work; it's the first modeled piece I did. Ever since, I've tried to see my works from all possible points of view and to draw them in every one of their aspects. That mask has been on my mind in every thing I have done\\". His later portraits have a singular life and individuality, partly because Rodin stayed on his contour modeling principles.  Problems  The mask was originally titled Portrait of M. * and was generally rejected because it presented a man with a broken nose and strong, sharp facial features; which was considered ugly to the eyes of most people.

The chapel was initially build in the mid to late 11th-century, but rebuilt and expanded over the next two centuries till labeled a church. The belltower has stones arrayed in a herringbone orientations, interspersed with brick. In the 17th century, a hermitage for a single occupant was attached to chapel.

Five of them survive on the southern exterior flank, depicting San Grato of Aosta (protector against inclement weather, St Antony Abbot, St Giulio, the Pieta, and St Christopher (patron of travelers). The interior of the church was frescoed in 1512 by the Sperindio brothers and Francesco Cagnola. Along the walls of the nave are depictions of the Life and Passion of Christ. Some of the events derive from new testament Biblical Apocrypha. Cagnola painted thirty-seven squares, framed by white or red bands: thirteen depict Stories of Christ's childhood, twenty-three Stories of his Passion and finally the Story of Original Sin. In the counterfacade arch, there is a depiction of the Final Judgment.

He was one of three scientists who connected wakefulness to a series of brain structures known as the reticular activating system, and his work reframed sleep as an active process in the brain rather than a passive one. He received the Karl Spencer Lashley Award from the American Philosophical Society and the Feltrinelli Prize from the Accademia dei Lincei. Early life Born in Campagnola Emilia, Moruzzi grew up in Parma. He came from a line of physicians; his father was a general practitioner, his great- grandfather was a pathology professor, and his uncle was a colleague of Jean- Martin Charcot. History and literature were Moruzzi's favorite subjects when he was growing up, but he chose to study medicine because Italy's economy was struggling at the time and he knew that he would always have job opportunities with a medical degree. Moruzzi studied at the University of Parma under neuroanatomist Antonio Pensa, who had been trained by Camillo Golgi. Pensa left to work in Pavia, but Moruzzi stayed behind, in part because he could not afford to move away from home but also because his interests had shifted from neuroanatomy to neurophysiology. Mario Camis mentored Moruzzi, and Moruzzi followed him to Bologna in 1936. Career Beginning in 1937, Moruzzi studied under Frederic Bremer at the Neurophysiologic Institute at the University of Brussels. He then worked at the Neurophysiological Institute of Cambridge under Edgar Adrian, where the pair became known for recording discharges from single motor neurons in the pyramidal tracts. In the years following World War II, many European scientists relocated to the United States. Moruzzi came to Northwestern University to work with a brain scientist named Steven Ranson. Once at Northwestern, Moruzzi met Horace Winchell Magoun and Donald B. Lindsley, and they worked to elucidate the neural processes responsible for wakefulness. Until the 1940s, some scientists felt like wakefulness simply required an adequate level of sensory input rather than a specific process inside the brain. In a 1949 experiment with a cat, Moruzzi and Magoun proved that stimulation of a certain brain region (near the intersection of the pons and midbrain) created a state of alertness. This stimulated area of the brain became known as the reticular activating system or reticular formation. In their experiments, Moruzzi and Magoun also transected the cat's reticular formation without disrupting any of the sensory nerves; the cat was rendered comatose. The experiment shifted science's conception of sleep from a passive process to one that was actively controlled by the brain. Death Moruzzi was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1975; he retired in 1980 and died in 1986. He was survived by his wife, Maria Vittoria Venturini, and two sons. Influence and legacy The \\"Moruzzi school of physiology\\" helped to develop a generation of Italian scientists. Giovanni Berlucchi received early research training as a postdoctoral fellow with Moruzzi, and he became one of the most eminent Italian neurophysiologists. Moruzzi also influenced scientists like Giacomo Rizzolatti, Arnaldo Arduini, Lamberto Maffei and Piergiorgio Strata. In 1965, Moruzzi won the Karl Spencer Lashley Award from the American Philosophical Society. He was awarded the Feltrinelli Prize from the Accademia dei Lincei, and he received honorary degrees from several universities in the United States and Europe, including the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Lyon. In 1981, Moruzzi became a founding member of the World Cultural Council. In a 1990 speech, Nobel laureate Rita Levi-Montalcini said that Moruzzi had been more deserving of the 1986 Nobel Prize that was awarded to her.

The last known king from the family's imperial branch, he probably ruled a part of his ancestral kingdom in present-day Uttar Pradesh.  Early life  Harishchandra was a son of the Gahadavala king Jayachandra. He has been mentioned in two of his father's inscriptions, which suggest that he was born in about 1175 CE. An inscription dated 10 August 1175 CE (1232 VS) records a grant made on the occasion of the jatakarman (childbirth) ceremony of Harishchandra. Another inscription dated 10 August 1175 CE records a second grant made to celebrate the namakarana (naming) ceremony of Harishchandra.

He was around 19 years old at the time. According to one theory, he was a Ghurid vassal. However, in an inscription found at Kotwa (near Machhali Shahar), he assumes the traditional sovereign titles: Parama- bhattaraka Maharajadhiraja Parameshvara, Ashva-pati Nara-pati Gaja-pati Rajatrayadhipati, and Vividha-vidya-vichara-vachaspati. This inscription is dated 6 January 1197, and records the grant of a village by Harishchandra. It was issued from Chyavaneshvara-Ghatta on Ganga, at Dhanamvakra. It is possible that Harishchandra continued to rule Kanyakubja (Kannauj) after Jayachandra's death. No contemporary Muslim historians mention that the Ghurids captured the city in 1193 CE. The Tabaqat-i Nasiri states that the Ghurid army marched towards Kannauj, but does not state whether it reached the city or not. According to it, Kannauj was captured only years later by Iltutmish (r. 1211-1236), who issued coins to celebrate this conquest. Other contemporary accounts, such as Taj-ul-Maasir and Kamil-ut-Tawarikh do not mention Kannauj among the places visited and sacked by the Ghurid army either. Firishta was the earliest writer to claim that the Muslims captured Kannauj in the 1190s, but his account can be ignored as inaccurate because he flourished several decades later, in the 16th century. These evidences suggest that Harishchandra may have been able to retain a part of his ancestral kingdom, possibly including Varanasi. An inscription dated 29 April 1197 CE, found at Belkhara in Mirzapur district, mentions that it was issued under the rule of a feudatory (ranaka) named Vijayakarna. It records the erection of a Ganesha pillar. The inscription does not mention Harishchandra, but states that it was issued in the \\"victorious kingdom of Kanyakubja\\", and mentions the usual titles of the Gahadavala kings. It is possible that a struggle was going on between Harishchandra and the Muslim generals at that time. In these uncertain times, Vijayakarna may have avoided explicitly naming a particular overlord in the inscription so as not to displease the rival of that overlord. The ultimate fate of Harishchandra is not known, but he was probably defeated by the Delhi Sultanate under Iltutmish. A 1237 inscription issued during the reign of one Adakkamalla of Gahadavala family was found in Nagod State (present-day Satna district of Madhya Pradesh). It is possible that Adakkamalla was the successor of Harishchandra. Another possibility is that Adakkamalla was from a different branch of the dynasty. One of his ancestors might have been granted a small fief by his relative Govindachandra in the newly annexed Kalachuri territory. Nothing is known about Adakkamalla's predecessors or successors.

It is 8 kilometres (5 miles) from Sydney's central business district and is one of two water airports in Sydney, the other being Palm Beach Water Airport.  History  On 4 August 1938, Rose Bay Water Airport was officially opened. However, it already had been established as a flying boat base on a 'temporary basis', and was the starting point for the London-Sydney flights that were operated by Qantas Empire Airways and Imperial Airways in a codeshare agreement. This made it Australia's first international airport. In 1942, due to the outbreak of World War II, commercial flights were suspended. Due to the arrival of passenger jetliners in the 1950s, a gradual demise in flying boats began. In 1955, Qantas discontinued its flying boat service and sold its fleet of flying boats to Ansett Airways. Ansett continued to operate flying boat services from Rose Bay Water Airport to Lord Howe Island until that was discontinued in 1974, after the island's land airport was opened.  Facilities  A Sydney Seaplanes Cessna 208 Caravan at Rose Bay Sydney Seaplanes has a single small terminal to serve customers, which is managed and maintained by Sydney Aviation, the owner of Sydney Seaplanes.

One of the legends of Bruneian football, he most notably played for the Brunei M-League representative team that won the 1999 Malaysia Cup, which is regarded as Brunei football's greatest achievement. He also played professionally for Brunei DPMM FC for several seasons. Prior to his marriage in 2001, his given name was Awangku Sallehuddin due to naming rules for descendants of Bruneian royalty. Club career =Early career= Sallehuddin began his sporting career playing tennis under a government scheme, representing Brunei at the Davis Cup in 1994 and 1995. It was around this time that he also made his football debut in the Malaysia Premier League, appearing for the Brunei representative team. Towards the turn of the century Sallehuddin found more playing time in expense of the ageing Martilu Mohamed on the left side of a back three, a formation favoured by David Booth and his successor Mick Jones. He started the 1999 Malaysia Cup final alongside captain and fellow legend Liew Chuan Fue and first-season debutant Norsillmy Taha and claimed a 2-1 victory in Kuala Lumpur through two goals by Rosli Liman. Sallehuddin inherited the captain's armband from Liew and stayed with Brunei as the severely-depleted team were immediately relegated to Premier Two, managing only two wins and conceding the most goals (53). He stayed with Brunei in the second tier of Malaysian football until 2005. =DPMM= Sallehuddin played with local club AH United in the B-League (winning the 2005-06 FA Cup) until the middle of 2006 when he transferred to Brunei DPMM FC who were playing in the Malaysia Premier League for the first time after replacing Sallehuddin's own former team, Brunei. They achieved promotion to the 2006-07 Malaysia Super League that season and then astoundingly finished third in Malaysia's top tier thanks to goals from topscoring Shahrazen Said. DPMM moved to the Singaporean S.League in 2009, after the deregistration of the Brunei Football Association (BAFA) by the Registrar of Societies prompted the Football Association of Malaysia to exempt DPMM from the Super League. Sallehuddin was appointed captain and won the Singapore League Cup of that year, despite being suspended in the final. After an incident in the 39th minute in the game against Home United on 2 August, he was given a one-year ban by the Football Association of Singapore for bringing the game into disrepute. A month later, FIFA suspended Brunei which meant that DPMM could no longer play in the S.League. With only five matches to go, all of DPMM's results were expunged from record. Sallehuddin returned to AH United on loan in the 2010 Brunei Premier League 1, then AM Gunners for the short-lived 2011 season. Recalled to his parent club after their re-entry into the S.League in 2012, the 39-year-old was still being relied on by coach Vjeran Simunic. Sallehuddin won the League Cup and finished second in the league behind Tampines Rovers in 2012, but after a disappointing 2013 campaign, he was released in the close season. =Kota Ranger= After a year without league football, Sallehuddin lined up one last time alongside Norsillmy Taha at Kota Ranger FC in the 2015 Brunei Premier League. He helped his team go top of the table and win promotion to the 2016 Brunei Super League. International career Sallehuddin played three games for the national team at the 20th SEA Games held in Brunei, scoring the third goal in the first game against Cambodia in a 3-3 draw. His next two international tournaments were the 2000 AFC Asian Cup qualifying and the 2002 World Cup qualifying, both were disastrous campaigns where Brunei scored no goals and conceded 39. Sallehuddin went with a team composed largely of QAF FC players for the 2006 AFC Challenge Cup held in Bangladesh, Brunei failed to advance from the group stage courtesy of goal difference. His final appearances for the national team were at the 2008 AFF Suzuki Cup qualifying held in Cambodia where he scored a penalty in the 76th minute against Timor- Leste in their only win from 4 games.

It was created in 1924 to control city-owned and operated public transportation service within the New York City Transit System. The agency oversaw the construction and operation of the municipal Independent Subway System (IND), which was constructed shortly after the Board was chartered. The BOT later presided over the major transfers of public transit from private control to municipal control that took place in the 1940s, including the unification of the New York City Subway in 1940. In 1953, the Board was dissolved and replaced by the state-operated New York City Transit Authority, now part of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). History =Background= In 1874, the New York State Legislature passed a bill allowing for the creation of a rapid transit commission in New York City, which was formed in 1875. This commission mapped out elevated railway routes that would be built by private companies, but did not plan any underground lines. In 1889, Mayor Hugh J. Grant created a five-member rapid transit board to lay out lines in the city. In 1891, the State Legislature passed the Rapid Transit Act, allowing the government of New York City and all cities with a population of over one million to create a board of \\"rapid transit railroad commissioners\\", which would dictate the expansion of rapid transit facilities within the city. The government could issue bonds in order to fund rapid transit for the city. That year, a five-member rapid transit board was created for the city, called the Board of Rapid Transit Railroad Commissioners. The board received bids for a municipal underground rail line, but no bids were selected. The board was abolished in 1894 by the State Legislature due to its failure to create a subway line. It was replaced by a new board whose members included the Mayor of New York City. That year, the New York City government issued a referendum stating that future rapid transit lines should be municipally operated, as opposed to issuing franchises to private operators. In spite of this, the initial subway lines to be operated in the city ‚àí the \\"first subway\\" opened in 1904, and the initial portion of the Centre Street Loop to Essex Street opened in 1908 ‚àí were privately operated by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT) respectively. The initial 1890s transit board was replaced in 1907 by the state-run New York Public Service Commission (PSC). This agency would oversee the Dual Contracts subway expansion, which led to the construction of new lines for the IRT and BRT. =Creation and subway unification= Until 1924, municipal public transportation actions originated primarily from state-controlled agencies, including the 1891 and 1894 rapid transit boards, the PSC, and most recently the New York State Transit Commission which was created in March 1921. Following the creating of the State Transit Commission and the reelection of Al Smith as Governor of New York in 1922, then-mayor John Francis Hylan and future mayors Jimmy Walker (then a state senator) and John P. O'Brien (the city's corporation counsel) sought to establish a city-controlled transit commission. Hylan had been both an opponent of private transit operation, particularly that of the Brooklyn‚ÄìManhattan Transit Corporation (BMT; the successor to the BRT), and a political opponent of Smith. Hylan also had his own plans for a city-operated subway system. In 1924, the New York City Board of Transportation was created by the New York City Board of Estimate following a bill passed by New York State Legislature. The Board of Transportation would responsible for mapping and constructing new rapid transit lines, carrying out the powers dictated in the 1891 Rapid Transit Act, while the State Transit Commission would continue to oversee the privately operated systems. The bill had been deadlocked in the State Assembly for two years until a compromise bill was introduced in February 1924 and passed on April 11 of that year. Governor Smith signed the bill into law on May 2, and the BOT assumed power on June 1. The board's first chairman was John Hanlon Delaney, one of Hylan's top advisers who had been the transit construction commissioner since 1919. The BOT would release the initial plans for what would become the Independent Subway System (IND) on December 9, 1924, based largely off of Mayor Hylan's plans. The first IND subway line and the system's trunk line, the IND Eighth Avenue Line, broke ground on March 14, 1925, and was opened on September 10, 1932. On August 29, 1929, the BOT released its first major plans for the expansion of the city- owned system still under construction.Board of Transportation of the City of New York Engineering Department, Proposed Additional Rapid Transit Lines And Proposed Vehicular Tunnel, dated August 23, 1929 A revision of this proposal was released almost ten years later on July 5, 1939.Project for Expanded Rapid Transit Facilities, New York City Transit System, dated July 5, 1939 These plans would later be called the IND Second System, and would go largely unbuilt due to the Great Depression and World War II. Beginning on June 1, 1940 under the mayoral administration of Fiorello H. La Guardia, the Board of Transportation took over the assets of the IRT and BMT for municipal operations in an event referred to as unification. The event placed the three rapid transit systems ‚àí IRT, BMT, IND ‚àí under a single operator. The BOT also inherited the BMT's extensive surface transit network in Brooklyn and Queens, which consisted primarily of streetcar lines along with a few electric trolley coach and diesel-powered bus routes. The BOT proceeded to close the IRT- operated Second and Ninth Avenue elevated lines in Manhattan, and the BMT- operated Third and Fifth Avenue elevateds in Brooklyn. On December 15, 1940, the IND's second Manhattan trunk line ‚àí the IND Sixth Avenue Line ‚àí was completed. In 1941, the BOT began motorizing the former BMT streetcar lines in Brooklyn and Queens into diesel bus routes or trolley coach routes. The further motorization of surface lines, and the completion of the IND system, however, was delayed due to World War II. Unification made the Board of Transportation the largest public transit operator in North America, in addition to being one of the few systems under public ownership at the time. Following the end of World War II, the BOT resumed subway construction. On February 23, 1947, the Board of Transportation assumed the bus routes of Isle Transportation in Staten Island. On March 30, 1947, the BOT took over the North Shore Bus Company in Queens. Both companies could not operate on the mandated five-cent fare and went bankrupt. This gave the city control of the majority of surface transit in Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. It also created three distinct surface transit divisions: the Brooklyn Bus and Trolley Division, the Staten Island Bus Division, and the Queens Bus Division.New York Times, Queens Bus Routes Taken Over by City, September 19, 1926, page 24 On September 24, 1948, the BOT took over the East Side Omnibus Corporation and Comprehensive Omnibus Corporation in Manhattan. At this time, the BOT resumed motorizing trolley lines, and proceeded to construct new storage and repair facilities. It also purchased new buses, to either replace streetcars or the dilapidated buses inherited from private operators. =Decline= A GM \\"old- look\\" transit bus bearing the original green and white color scheme of the Board of Transportation, and a white circular BOT logo. The color scheme would be inherited by the Transit Authority. Following an artificial operating surplus during World War II, brought on by gas and rubber rations leading to increased mass transit usage, the Board of Transportation had its first operational deficit in 1947, amounting to $18 million. On March 30, 1948, Governor Thomas E. Dewey signed legislation to allow the BOT to increase fares with the approval of the New York City mayor. On July 1, 1948, the Board of Transportation raised the fare for its rapid transit system from five cents to ten cents, with the approval of Mayor William O'Dwyer. The nickel fare had been in place in the subway system since October 27, 1904, a period of 45 years, and was one of the main provisions of the Dual Contracts. New York City was the last major city to have a five-cent fare. The BOT also created 14 new free transfers between the formerly-separate subway divisions. The fare increase was put forward due to increasing debt, inflation in the post-war period, expenditure on new subway routes, equipment and facilities, and maintenance of the existing system which was in disrepair. In addition, city planner Robert Moses pushed for the fare increase to allow more city funding to go towards highway development, while Transport Workers Union of America leader Michael J. Quill supported the fare hike in order to give transit workers a 30-cent per hour wage increase. In 1950, the fare of BOT surface transit was also raised to ten cents. Upon the initial 1948 increases, a twelve-cent fare had been put in place for a combined trip on the subway and either bus or trolley, but this was eliminated on July 1, 1952. The fare hikes did not effectively increase revenue for the Board of Transportation to offset increasing operation costs, while system ridership plateaued due to the American car culture and increasing migration to the suburbs. After two years of financial surplus, the BOT experienced a $1.2 million deficit in 1950, and a $24.8 million deficit in 1952. The BOT was also criticized due to the influence of politics on the organization, the direct control over the board by the mayor, and the use of the city's operating budget to subsidize transit operations. In March 1953, the New York State Legislature created the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA), a public authority without direct control from a political office, with members appointed by both the Governor and Mayor. Governor Dewey signed the bill approving the creation of the TA into law on March 20, 1953. On June 15, 1953, operation of the New York City Transit System was turned over to the Transit Authority, with the Board of Estimate leasing the system to the TA for a period of ten years. The Board of Transportation, meanwhile, was dissolved. The new Transit Authority was modeled after the existing Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, the latter of which is also now part of the MTA. Headquarters Jay Street‚ÄìMetroTech subway complex adjacent to 370 Jay Street, the former Board of Transportation Headquarters. The Board of Transportation's final headquarters was located at 370 Jay Street, at the northwest corner of Jay Street and Wiloughby Street in the modern MetroTech Center of Downtown Brooklyn. The building is bound by Pearl Street to the west, and was formerly bound by Myrtle Avenue at its north end; this portion of the street has since been de-mapped. The 14-story office building was designed by architects William Haugaard and Andrew J. Thomas in post-war modernist style. The building is L-shaped, the long side along Jay Street, and the short side along the former Myrtle Avenue. The outer facade of the building consists of white limestone, with 420 square and uniformly-arranged casement windows. The building was intended to serve as the central headquarters of the BOT. The building housed 2,500 employees from several divisions of the board including its executive, legal, and engineering staff. The remainder of the building not used by the BOT would be rented out. The ground level of the building at Jay and Wiloughby Streets is designed with numerous columns forming an arcade. Haugaard, the lead designer, had drafted the design prior to World War II. Within the arcade and adjacent to the building are several entrances to the Jay Street‚ÄìMetroTech subway complex, which consisted of two separate stations when the building was constructed. The location was selected in order to be in close proximity to the lines of all three subway divisions, in order to collect fares via money train. Passageways from the subway stations, including a visible door in the Jay Street IND station, lead to a money sorting room in the basement of the building. Ground broke on the site on October 8, 1948. The building was erected at a time when many other BOT transit facilities were also being built. The headquarters opened on April 1, 1951, just two years before the BOT ceased existence, and after the death of Haugaard. It cost $10 million to construct. The BOT proceeded to vacate its former headquarters, one at Hudson Street at the entrance to the Holland Tunnel in Hudson Square, Manhattan, and the other in the former Paramount Theatre in Downtown Brooklyn. Following the dissolution of the BOT, the building was used by the Transit Authority as its headquarters, and later used by the MTA with some space rented out to other organizations including the New York City Police Department. In 1990, the Transit Authority moved its primary headquarters out of 370 Jay Street, to its current location on Livingston Street. Other MTA operations were moved to 2 Broadway (now the headquarters of MTA Bridges and Tunnels) in Manhattan in 1998. In January 2006, the money train operations ended, after which the MTA largely vacated the site. The building is currently being converted for use as part of the Brooklyn Campus of New York University.

It is the largest of its kind in South Africa. The area sees up to 460 000 people daily, who come to the area to for its transport interchange and market shopping.  History  Initially used as a market space by Indian traders during apartheid, the area become popular with black traders towards to the end of apartheid.  Markets  Warwick Junction is home to nine distinct markets, where informal and formal traders sell a variety of products, from food to traditional medicine. There are approximately 5000 to 8000 vendors in the area. The Bead Market has vendors who are mostly from coastal areas adjacent to Durban selling traditional Zulu beadwork items. Berea Station Market, located near two rail stations, has vendors selling traditional Zulu items such as spears and shields, as well as modern clothing and technology items. The Bovine Head Market consists of vendors who cook and sell cows' heads, a traditional African delicacy. Brook Street Market consists of two sections: an upper level food court, and a lower level market with vendors selling clothing and household goods. It is located alongside the Badsha Peer Shrine, built by the original Indian traders in the area. The Early Morning Market is the most famous of all the markets at Warwick Junction, and consists of up to 200 traders. Products on offer include fresh produce, spices and flowers. This market has been earmarked for a shopping mall development The Herb Market consists of vendors who sell traditional African medicine. There are up to 700 traders in this market. Traditional healers diagnose customers according to their ailments and then recommend a herbal product for the relief of symptoms. The Impepho and Lime Market has vendors who sell white and red lime, mined in Ndwedwe north of Durban. This lime is used by sangomas, or traditional healers. Vendors also sell incense known as impepho which is believed to help with communication with one's ancestors. The impepho vendors are almost exclusively from Lusikisiki in the Eastern Cape Province, who collect the herbs that grow in that area and travel to Durban to sell them. Victoria Street Market was founded in 1910, and consists of 180 traders with individually-owned stores selling jewellery, spices and traditional art.  Transportation  The Warwick Triangle area became an important transportation hub during apartheid, as Indian and African-owned buses were not allowed access to the inner city. Today, the area is the largest transportation hub in the city, with a taxi rank, bus rank, and railway stations linking to the city's different nodes.

For example, piles of stones have been found in such rooms that suggest they were used as a store for projectiles to be used in time of siege.

It is a ground orchid with a single hairy leaf and a reddish-pink flower with thick, black, club-like swellings on the petals and sepals. Although formally described in 1988 living specimens have not been observed since 1979. Description Caladenia brachyscapa is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single hairy leaf, long, wide with a few red blotches near the base. A single flower wide is borne on a wiry, hairy spike high. The dorsal sepal is long, wide and is erect or curved forward. The lateral sepals are about the same length as the dorsal sepal but wide and the petals are long and wide. The sepals and petals are pinkish with red markings and end in a club-like, dark reddish-brown gland. The labellum is long, wide when flattened, white to reddish with a deep red tip which curves downwards. The sides of the labellum curve upwards and have 5 to 7 purplish teeth up to long on each side and the middle part has blunt white teeth near its tip. There are four or six rows of calli along the centre of the labellum. Flowering occurs from October to November. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Geoffrey Carr in 1988 and the description was published in Muelleria from a specimen collected near Warrnambool in 1959. At the time, this was the only specimen known apart from a partly opened flower which may be of the same species, collected in the Port Campbell National Park in 1966. There is a single recording of the species on Clarke Island in 1979, but the area where it was seen has since been heavily grazed and probably no longer suitable for this orchid. It is now presumed to be extinct in both Victoria and Tasmania. The specific epithet (brachyscapa) is derived from the Ancient Greek words brachys meaning \\"short\\" and skapos meaning \\"stem\\". Distribution and habitat The only certain specimen of this species was growing in partly cleared forest at the type location near Warrnambool. Conservation Caladenia brachyscapa is classified as \\"presumed extinct\\" under the Commonwealth Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC) Act and as \\"extinct\\" under the Victorian Government Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988.

Life =Early years= Emmi Effenberger was born in Ruppersdorf, one of a cluster of villages subsumed into Reichenberg (as it was then known) in north Bohemia, at that time an ethnically and linguistically German region in the Austro- Hungarian Empire. Her father, like many in the area, was a textile worker. He later became a founder member of the Czechoslovak Communist Party (\\"Komunistick√° strana ƒåeskoslovenska\\" / KSƒå), which some suggest must later have been helpful to his daughter in her own political career. After successfully concluding her schooling she moved on to a Teacher Training College and then embarked on a teaching career in nearby Neustadt. Following frontier changes mandated at the Congress of Versailles the Austro-Hungarian Empire ceased to exist and Bohemia found itself part of the newly formed state of Czechoslovakia, although at this stage the area of North Bohemia where Effenberger liver remained ethnically and linguistically German. Effenberger joined the Young Communists in 1920 and in 1924, the year of her eighteenth birthday, the KSƒå itself, working in her spare time as party secretary for the local party in Kratzau, and later undertaking similar work with the party regional leadership team (Bezirksleitung) in Reichenberg. In 1925 Emmi Effenberger became a member of the teachers' union, the ZdA (later the AfA- Bund). In 1928 she took a job with the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Youth League (\\"Kommunistischen Jugendverbandes der Tschechoslowakei\\"). She took a leading role in building up the Young Pioneer organisation (for children) within the Communist Youth League. In 1928 she embarked on a course at the International Lenin School in Moscow. She returned to Czechoslovakia in 1931 and resumed party secretarial duties. In 1932 Emmi Effenberger married Rudolf D√∂lling. =Hitler-Stalin years= The Nazi take- over across the border in Germany at the start of 1933 had its knock-on effect in the German-speaking parts of Czechoslovakia, and Emmi D√∂lling was briefly arrested. In 1934 she became secretary to the national executive of the Textile Workers' Union. During 1938 and 1939 Czechoslovakia was invaded and incorporated into an enlarged German state. During the middle part of the decade, with one-party rule brutally enforced in Germany, Czechoslovakia had become a favourite destination for exiled German communists, but non-Nazi political activists were now no safer in (former) Czechoslovakia than they would have been in post 1933 Germany. In 1938 or 1939 Rudolf and Emmi D√∂lling emigrated to the Soviet Union. In Moscow, like her husband, she initially took a job with International Red Aid (MOPR / \\"–ú–µ–∂–¥—É–Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–∞—è –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏—è –ø–æ–º–æ—â–∏ –±–æ—Ä—Ü–∞–º —Ä–µ–≤–æ–ª—é—Ü–∏–∏\\" / –ú–û–ü–†), a Soviet sponsored communist welfare organisation, and with the Comintern, working at the Comintern Academy. In October 1941 she was redeployed to Bashkortostan. In the Soviet Union she was for a time editor at the \\"Sudetan Germans Freedom Radio\\" (\\"\\"Sudetendeutschen Freiheitssender\\"). Between September 1943 and August 1944 she worked for the \\"Supress\\" press agency, and between August 1944 and November 1945 she worked in Moscow for the \\"Press Service Institute Number 205\\", one of several organisations that had emerged from the ashes of Comintern after it was officially dissolved by Josef Stalin in 1943. =Soviet occupation zone / German Democratic Republic= In December 1945, seven months after the formal end of the Second World War, Emmi D√∂lling returned from Moscow to Prague, joining her husband who had made the same journey seven months earlier. She relocated again in January 1946, moving to what had been administered, since the previous summer, as the Soviet occupation zone in Germany. She settled in Berlin and transferred into the Communist Party of Germany, taking a job with the party Central Committee. Following the contentious creation in the Soviet zone of the Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED), launched in April 1946, she was one of thousands of Communist Party members who lost no time in signing their party membership across to the SED. As a party employee Emmi D√∂lling held the rank of a department head (\\"Abteilungsleiterin\\") of the SED party executive. She became editor in chief of the party newspaper \\"Einheit\\" (\\"Unity\\") and in 1946/47 of \\"Neuer Weg\\" (\\"New Way\\").Bundesarchiv, Verlage und Redaktionen, 2014. Between 1947 and 1949 she was for most purposes out of action, seriously ill with Tuberculosis. Much of this time was spent in a sanatorium in S√ºlzhayn. From 1953 she was employed in the party's press office, and later in the Agitprop department of the Party Central Committee. Reflecting her husband's military connections she also worked on a free-lance basis for the Ministry of Defence. In 1959 her husband, who had himself been appointed a member of the Party Central Committee the previous year, retired from the People's Army and took up an appointment as the East German ambassador to the Soviet Union. The two of them moved to Moscow where they remained till 1965 when Rudolf D√∂lling retired from his ambassadorial post. When they returned Emmi became a member of the national executive of the Democratic Women's League (\\"Demokratischer Frauenbund Deutschlands\\" / DFD).Neue Zeit, 3. April 1976, p. 2.

It is described as \\"an erotic romantic comedy about social manipulation, crossdressing, and girls tying up other girls\\". Gameplay The player takes the role of an 18-year-old woman, who is manipulated by her twin brother to impersonate him during a senior class cruise, where she is to win a popularity contest. As she interacts with fellow students during the seven days of the cruise, she may in turn manipulate and seduce them, often through BDSM scenes. Some scenes feature nudity or sex. However, options to skip sex scenes and cover up nude protagonists with Christmas pullovers are available. In January 2017, Christine Love released a patch that changed a scene that had been the subject of much criticism by players and reviewers. In that scene, the player character had been made subject to nonconsensual sexual humiliation by a man. Distribution Ladykiller in a Bind is available for Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems. The game was initially only distributed through Humble Store and was unavailable on Steam due to that platform's policy against \\"too much\\" sexual content in games. A grassroots e-mail campaign by others in the video game industry sought to persuade Valve, the company operating Steam, to allow the game ‚Äì pointing out that Genital Jousting, a game about fighting penises, was allowed on the platform. In January 2017, Ladykiller in a Bind became available on Steam after Love managed to contact a person at Valve and explain the game. Reception =Critical reception= Ladykiller in a Bind received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews from game critics. On Metacritic, the game has an average of 73 out of 100 based on 7 reviews. Reviewing the game in Polygon, Allegra Frank appreciated the well-drawn characters and the game's \\"elegant\\", \\"organic\\" portrayal of non-conventional sexuality, but criticized the \\"abrupt and disappointing\\" ending. Hardcore Gamers Marcus Estrada noted the high-quality art, writing and soundtrack, as well as the game's \\"incredible cast of characters\\". Writing for Kill Screen, Jess Joho highlighted Ladykiller in a Binds \\"incredible accomplishment\\" of making consent ‚Äì which is central to the game's erotic scenes ‚Äì sexy by making \\"the most titillating parts show nothing more and nothing less than two people consenting, telling each other what they want with an unwavering honesty and understanding\\". She noted, however, that the focus on consent became at times too explicit. In Rock, Paper, Shotgun, Kate Gray wrote that it was \\"incredibly refreshing to see a game that‚Äôs not aimed by default at guys and straight people\\", but she criticized the game's narrative for undermining the idea of consensuality by having the protagonist deceive her partners about her gender, and as \\"irresponsible and damaging\\" for at times blurring the line between consensual BDSM acts, and forced or transactional sex. After the scene at issue was changed by a patch, Simone de Rochefort and Merritt k at Polygon considered the discussion about it \\"disheartening\\" in that it indicated the demand for \\"an impossible level of precision when dealing with messy topics, especially from queer developers\\". =Awards= In 2017 the game won the Excellence in Narrative Award at the Independent Games Festival.

Location The castle is in the Tece suburb of Mersin at . Its distance to Mersin city center is about . Although it is close to the state highway , it is difficult to visit the castle by motor vehicle because it is situated in a citrus plantation. History There is no record about the origin of the castle. However, judging from the architecture, it was probably a late Roman or a Byzantine castle. It was a low elevation castle, and it was built to control the road running parallel to the Mediterranean Sea coast. It was also used by the Crusades and Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, during which the castle underwent renovation. In June 1981 the American archaeologist and art historian Dr. Robert W. Edwards conducted a formal survey of this site and drew the following conclusions. The rectangular circuit wall and the fragments of its seven small towers were so badly decayed that it was impossible without a formal excavation to deduce the date of construction. However, the surviving portion of the three-storey estate house (keep) is primarily from one period of construction with masonry and architectural features identical to those used during the 12th and 13th centuries in the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. It is similar to the nearby medieval site of Kƒ±z near the Durak railway station. These sites were built by Armenian masons, perhaps for Crusader occupants.

The results of this test can be used to determine the anthelmintic resistance status of the animals. Generally an analytical sensitivity of 50 is used, 15 is also possible if a greater sensitivity is desired. In order to reduce the counting variability, using groups of at least 10-15 animals was suggested, depending on the animal species of interest. In addition, the mean pre- treatment fecal egg counts should be at least 150 eggs per gram, otherwise the test can give unreliable results.  Mathematical formulation  Suppose a group of n_T animals received anthelmintic treatment and a group of n_C animals serves as control. The percentage reduction in fecal egg counts can be calculated as \\\\text{Percentage reduction } = 100\\\\times \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{\\\\bar{x}_T}{\\\\bar{x}_C}\\\\right) where \\\\bar{x}_T and \\\\bar{x}_C denote the mean counts of the treatment and the control group. Assuming independence, the estimated asymptotic variance of the log ratio is given by \\\\widehat{\\\\text{Var}}\\\\left(\\\\log{\\\\frac{\\\\bar{X}_T}{\\\\bar{X}_C}}\\\\right)=\\\\frac{s^2_T}{n_T \\\\bar{x}^2_T}+\\\\frac{s^2_C}{n_C \\\\bar{x}^2_C}. where \\\\bar{X}_T and \\\\bar{X}_C denote the means of random samples, s^2_T and s^2_C denote the sample variance of the treatment and the control group counts. The variance can be used to construct an approximate 95% CI of the log ratio using the 97.5% and the 2.5% quantile of a Student's t-distribution with n_T+n_C-2 degrees of freedom. The CI for the log-ratio can be then transformed back to obtain the 95% CI for the estimated reduction.  Results interpretation  The World Association for the Advancement of Veterinary Parasitology guideline states that for sheep and goats, the resistance is present if (i) the percentage reduction in fecal egg counts is less than 95% and, (ii) the corresponding lower 95% confidence limit is less than 90%. If only one of these two criterion is met, then an anthelmintic resistance is suspected. Different thresholds have been suggested for other livestock.  Criticism and current alternatives  Firstly, the conventional counting techniques such as the McMaster method introduce additional variability in the counts which is not accounted for in the fecal egg count reduction test. As a result, the estimated percentage reduction are less reliable especially for low counts. Secondly, the distribution of egg counts is typically aggregated within the host population. There were several attempts to propose more elaborate statistical models in the past years. An emerging class of statistical model, namely Bayesian hierarchical models, has been proposed to overcome these problems. Easy-to-use software and website interface based on those sophisticated but reliable statistical models are available to aid veterinary researchers.

She left Period in 2020 after fellow activists accused her of misconduct and exaggerating her experiences with housing instability. In 2017, Okamoto launched an unsuccessful bid for a seat on the Cambridge City Council. Her debut book, Period Power: A Manifesto for the Menstrual Movement, was published in October 2018.  Early life  Okamoto was born in New York City before moving to Portland, Oregon. Her mother, Sophia Tzeng, graduated from Harvard University in 1995 and later Columbia Law School. Tzeng was previously a visiting instructor of social impact management at the University of Portland. Her father, Shintaro Okamoto, is the founder of Okamoto Studio. He attended Brown University and Hunter College. Okamoto is no longer in contact with her father and has shared her story publicly of experiencing sexual abuse and violence in her relationship with him as a child.  Education  Okamoto attended Catlin Gabel School as a Malone Scholar, a scholarship at the school offered to students in need of financial assistance. In December 2019, Catlin Gabel published a report on the school‚Äôs history of abuse by faculty towards students, wherein Okamoto‚Äôs experience of harassment and grooming from her student advisor of four years was included. Okamoto came forward publicly with more details on her experience related to the abuse in January 2020. It was later revealed that her former student advisor was fired immediately after the inappropriate behavior was reported to the school. He publicly denied all allegations. During her senior year of high school, Okamoto received the Gates Millennium Scholarship. Okamoto was also a 2016 Coca-Cola scholar, and designated as a notable alumnus of the program. She was also chosen as the 2016 Most Valuable Student Top Scholarship Winner by the Elks National Foundation, given to one female student per year. In October 2019, Okamoto was given Catlin Gabel's Distinguished Young Alumni award. Okamoto is a student at Harvard College, and was admitted as a member of the Class of 2020.  Career  In December 2014, Okamoto founded Period Inc. with Vincent Forand, a high school classmate. The organization distributes menstrual hygiene products, has campus chapters at universities and high schools around the United States, and advocates for ending what is known as the tampon tax. Okamoto moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, in August 2016 to attend Harvard College. Less than seven months later, Okamoto announced her candidacy for Cambridge City Council, with a campaign team primarily composed of other Harvard students. She was the youngest candidate in the race and focused her campaign on issues of affordable housing, education equity, and climate change. Okamoto eventually lost the election, taking 15th place out of 26 candidates. In 2018, Okamoto published her debut book, Period Power: A Manifesto for the Menstrual Movement with publisher Simon & Schuster, which made the Kirkus Reviews list for Best Young Adult Nonfiction of 2018. Okamoto first received the Women of Worth award in 2017, as one of the ten national honorees. In November 2019, Okamoto was awarded the L'Or√©al Women of Worth award at the annual Glamour Women of the Year ceremony. In December 2019, Okamoto was named one of Forbes 30 Under 30 in law and policy. On January 29, 2020, Okamoto announced that she had stepped down from Period Inc. as Executive Director; at the time, she stated that she would continue working with the organization. In June of 2020, other activists accused Okamoto of monopolizing visibility and resources for her organization and its associated chapter. Period later confirmed that Okamoto was no longer working with the organization. She was also accused of exaggerating the extent of her experience with homelessness, as Okamoto had described herself as \\"legally homeless\\" during a period when her family was experiencing financial instability and living with friends.

The model is developed and supported by researchers at the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI), in Bremerhaven, Germany.  Overview  FESOM implements the idea of using meshes with variable resolution to simulate the circulation of the global ocean with regional focus. Because of the broad range of scales characterizing the ocean circulation, downscaling is commonly needed to describe processes on regional scales. FESOM allows global multi- resolution cross-scale simulations without traditional nesting. The dynamical core of the new version (FESOM2) switches from the finite-element method used in the original version of FESOM to the finite-volume method for the sake of better computational efficiency. Both versions include the Finite-Element Sea Ice Model (FESIM).Danilov, S., Q. Wang, R. Timmermann, N. Iakovlev, D. Sidorenko, M. Kimmritz, T. Jung, and Schr√∂ter, J.

Model Dev., 8, 1747‚Äì1761, http://www.geosci-model-dev.net/8/1747/2015/ FESOM is also used as the ocean component of the AWI-CM, the coupled atmosphere-ocean climate model developed at AWI.  History  The prototype version of FESOM appeared in 2004 due to work of Sergey Danilov, Gennady Kivman and Jens Schr√∂ter. Ralph Timmermann extended it to a full global ocean - sea ice configuration in 2009. Qiang Wang rewrote its numerical algorithm and parameterizations from 2008 through 2014, which led to essentially improved numerical and physical performance.

Early life Maney was born in Boston and raised in Burlington, Massachusetts. During his youth, Maney played sandlot baseball and was a fan of the Boston Braves. He worked as a timekeeper for Coleman Brothers during the construction of the subway between Franklin and State Streets. Maney attended and graduated from Boston College. Business career Roosevelt Towers In 1929, Maney opened C. J. Maney Construction Co., Inc. The company's original offices were located at 50 Congress Street in Boston, but later moved to Lexington, Massachusetts. By 1945, the firm was doing $30 million worth of work on wartime construction projects. Projects Maney's company constructed included Boston College's Fulton Hall, the Boston College Law Library, the Roosevelt Towers housing project in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the Castle Island Container Terminal. Outside of construction, Maney served as a director of the Union Savings Bank and was a trustee of the Boston Public Library and the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. He also served as president of the New England Road Builders Association and treasurer of the First Franklin Parking Corporation and the First Federal Parking Corporation. Boston Braves In 1941, Maney was a member of a syndicate led by Bob Quinn that purchased controlling interest in the Boston Braves (then known as the Bees) from Charles Adams. In May 1943, in an effort to draw in fans by increasing the amount of home runs at Braves Field, Maney had the park's right field fenced moved in 20 feet (340 to 320 feet). In the fall of 1943, Maney and two other minority partners, Louis Perini and Guido Rugo, issued an ultimatum to the other members of the syndicate - to buy out the trio's stock for what they paid for it or allow the three to purchase the other partners' stock for what they paid for it. The other stockholders elected to sell and that January, Perini, Maney, and Rugo purchased the club outright. The three businessmen, who were all contractors, were known as the \\"Three Little Steam Shovels\\". In 1948, the Braves won the National League pennant, but lost the World Series to the Cleveland Indians. In 1951, Rugo sold his interest in the club to Perini and Maney. Maney sold his interest to Perini the following year and the club moved to Milwaukee shortly thereafter. Personal life At the time of his death, Maney resided in Chestnut Hill. He was previously a resident of Cambridge. He also had a summer home in Scituate, Massachusetts, where he raised Wire Fox Terriers which won championships in shows across the United States. Maney was made a Knight of Malta and a Knight of the Holy Sepulchre by Pope Pius XII. Death Maney died on January 7, 1954 at the New England Medical Center in Boston following a heart attack.

After a period working as a computer repairer and being involved in forums in the mid 2000s, Kleczynski co-founded Malwarebytes with Bruce Harrison in January 2008. By 2014, Malwarebytes had treated over 250 million computers worldwide, with a range of popular products including Malwarebytes Anti-Malware, Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit, and more recently, advanced anti-ransomware package Endpoint Security. Kleczynski was named one of Forbes Magazine's '30 Under 30' Rising Stars of Enterprise Technology in 2015. Early life and background Kleczynski was born in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Poland in 1989. His family emigrated to the United States when he was just 3 years old. Despite moving from Poland at such a young age, he speaks fluent Polish. As a child he had aspirations to be a train conductor, and later, an airline pilot. He has retained his fascination with flying‚Äîin 2011 he obtained his pilot's license. Kleczynski attended Fenton High School in Bensenville, Illinois and received his B.S. from the University of Illinois, where he was a member of the Theta Chi fraternity, in 2012. Career As a teenager, Kleczynski found a job working as a technician in a computer repair shop in Chicago. It was while working at the repair shop in Chicago that Kleczynski noticed that whenever infected computers arrived, they would generally reformat the computer, regardless if the infection was only minor. It was only when his mother's computer became infected that Kleczynski learned more about why the virus wasn't directly attacked, finding that neither McAfee nor Symantec would remove the malware from his system. He later recalled \\"I've never been as angry as when I got my computer infected\\", and professed that his mother told him to fix it \\"under penalty of death\\". It was only after Kleczynski posted on the forum SpywareInfo, popular at the time, that he was able to learn how to cure it, which took three days. The company was unofficially founded after this, when Kleczynski conversed and became friends with several of the editors of the forum, who tempted him to buy an unused domain from them. As a result, Malwarebytes was informally established in 2004. Kleczynski began writing his own free software tools in Visual Basic. With one of the site's regulars, Bruce Harrison, Kleczynski wrote the inaugural version of the company's software. In 2006, worked with a college roommate to produce a freely available program called \\"RogueRemover\\", a utility which specialized in fighting against a type of infection known as \\"rogues\\", which scam computer users into giving away their credit card information through fake anti-virus software. RogueRemover proved instrumental in developing Malwarebytes Anti- Malware, and Kleczynski was able to set up a forum which enabled him to improve the software through feedback. Kleczynski and Harrison formally launched Malwarebytes on January 21, 2008 while Kleczynski was studying computer science at the University of Illinois. Bruce became the VP of Research for Malwarebytes, and he further hired Doug Swanson, and experienced freeware development technician. Kleczynski and Harrison reportedly made $600,000 in their first year of selling the software, despite not having met personally at the time. Kleczynski reportedly made his first million by the time he was 19. In 2014, Malwarebytes received $30 million in funding from Highland Capital, and by the following year it announced that it had treated 250 million computers worldwide, representing about 20-25% of working business computers. In June 2015, Kleczynski moved the firm's headquarters from 10 Almaden Boulevard in San Jose, California to a new office space on the two top floors of the 12-story 3979 Freedom Circle in Santa Clara, California. The new office is more than twice the size of the former office.

She is known mostly for her portraits and other paintings hidden within the Ringelblum Archive, in the Warsaw Ghetto during the Holocaust. The paintings were found after the end of World War II, and are now held mostly in the archive of the Jewish Historical Institute, in Warsaw, Poland. Early life Gela was born in Warsaw in a working-class family. Her father was a cobbler, and her mother died in 1918. The writer Joshua Singer discovered her talent. Through him she met actor and director Jonas Turkow, who introduced her in turn to the sculptor Henryk Kuna. Thanks to Kuna's help, she received a two-month scholarship to study in the ASP in Krakow. Gela paid her benefactors back in the 1930s by drawing their portraits. Gela spent about 13 years in Krakow; according to her own testimony, she studied in the Academy for two years, but her name was not recorded in any of the enrollment lists of the school's archives. Starting in 1931, she visited Warsaw regularly to display her work in group exhibitions several times during the 1930s, and she moved to Warsaw in 1937. She was a member of the Association of Jewish Artists, and the Jewish Society of Fine Arts, both in Warsaw. During this period she painted numerous portraits of Jewish figures in Warsaw, mostly intellectuals and writers. Among these portraits are those of Rachela Korn, Baruch Gelman, Szymon Horonczyk, Icyk Manger and Moshe Broderson.Gela Seksztajn, her life and work, by Magdalena Tarnowska. In \\"Gela Seksztajn - A Jewish Painter in the Warsaw Guetto\\", Fundacion Alon para Las Artes, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 2011  Warsaw years  Gela moved to Warsaw in 1937. She married the journalist Izrael Lichtensztejn in 1938. During those years she worked as a teacher of arts and handicrafts in Jewish schools. During the late 1930s she painted a large number of portraits and scenes. She participated in several exhibitions and received good reviews during these years.  Warsaw Ghetto and Ringelblum archive  Gela and her husband Izrael were forced to move into the Warsaw Ghetto probably in 1940. Just before the Ghetto was sealed off in that year, Gela gave birth to her daughter, Margalit. Gela and Izrael were both active in the Ghetto in charity organizations. Gela held drawing classes in the Ghetto, and mounted small exhibits of her students' works. She probably participated in making the costumes for a children's show entitled \\"The Seasons\\" in 1942. She was awarded a prize, for her work with children, by the Judenrat chairman Adam Czerniak√≥w.Letter of G. Seksztajn to Hirszel, Sept. 1942, Archiwum ZIH, Ring II, or 258 Gela continued to paint during her Ghetto years, drawing portraits such as children in the soup kitchen, her daughter, her husband, and her friends writers. Gela, together with Izrael, actively participated in the Oneg Shabbat enterprise, headed by Dr. Emmanuel Ringelblum, which dealt with secretly documenting Jewish life within the Ghetto. In July 1942 German deportations from the Ghetto started. Knowing that the end is near, Gela prepared her works for hiding in the secret archive. In the early days of August, Izrael Lichtenstejn her spouse, and two of his students, Dawid Graber and Nachum Grzywacz, hid Gela's paintings, together with other documents, in the archive boxes that he buried in a school cellar on Nowolipki Str. The exact date of Gela‚Äôs death is unknown, but it is believed she died during the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Gela left more than 300 paintings. Most of them can be found in the Jewish Historical Institute, although there are a few paintings also in Washington Holocaust museum and one oil painting in Yad Vashem art section. Gela is mentioned in Izrael Lichtenstejn's will from 1943, cited in Paul Auster's book, The Invention of Solitude. He writes there: \\"I want my wife to be remembered. Gele Seckstein, artist, dozens of works, talented, didn't manage to exhibit, did not show in public.

Cut into the peak of a mountain, it is believed that worshipers who ascend to the temple may receive divine sanction and blessings from Lord Shiva. A sculpture there is a Swayambhu Lingam. Swayambhu is a Sanskrit word that means \\"something created by its own agreeing\\".  History  The duration of human lives are under four periods called Yugas. They are Satya yuga, Treta yuga, Dvapara yuga and Kali yuga. At the end of each period, all lives are demolished. Some Vedas give some reference that the energy of good vibes, which was considered to be a god in those days, will demolish and re-birth himself to build up lives on earth. During this period, Vedas say that two saints named Kagabajendra and Ganapathy re-birthed themselves as a crow. They stayed alive as an ambassador to a god to regenerate the new world, because of the former demolition. A small cave temple is situated in the top of the hill for the Kagabajendran sage. It is said that Saint Kagabajendra will visit the temple to worship the god in the form of a mild storm at dusk. This storm will start from the bottom of the hill and end when it enters the temple, lasting for only two seconds.  Architecture  Structures, buildings, and sculptures were built by excavating rock. The temple steps are in a rock-cut framework. Rain or high winds make it difficult to ascend or descend. A perennial spring operates on the top.  Specialties  During British rule, they decided to develop a blueprint to restore the original borders. The blueprint consists of three access points to detect distorted places. The three hills are called Kodaikanal hills, Tirumala hills and Kondarangi hills, known locally as the Malliswar hills. This British framework is known as the Triangle survey. This survey was found to be useful to report the borders of Newland in Tamil Nadu after a severe earthquake. Worshipers pray by joining hands in a pyramid format, as a reference to Kondarangi. This place features as a preeminent site for bare-skinned meditation, mostly by maharishis. One point was carved by Pancha Pandavas to worship Lord Shiva. The temple has a Cave where Sidhhars and Thavasis have done meditation. Another temple located in the foothills is known as Ketti Malleswarar Sri Bhramaramba Temple.  Transport  The temple is 19 km from Oddanchatram Railway station to Lord Malligarjuna Swamy Temple ‚Äì Kondarangi Hills Temple.  Festivals  The most celebrated festival is the Mahasivarathri and Chitra Pournami. Other festivals are Paradhosam, Ammavasai, and Pournami. Paradhosam is a Lord Shiva prayer conducted after 15 days of each month. Ammavasai is a new moon festival on the Hindu lunar calendar that is also celebrated in Kondarangi hills. The Pournami festival is a common Indian festival among the Tamil Hindus, a prayer festival dedicated to the Hindu god of underworld. On Mondays, special poojas may be conducted.

The site is bounded by Pearl Street to the west, and was formerly bound by Myrtle Avenue at its north end; this portion of the street has since been de-mapped. The site has historically served as the headquarters for the operating agency of the New York City Transit System, built by the New York City Board of Transportation (BOT). After 1953, it housed the New York City Transit Authority and Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), which succeeded the BOT. The building is notable for housing the revenue-collecting operations of the New York City Subway, performed by money trains on nearby subway lines, which were connected to the lower levels of the building via passageways. The building is one of the earliest modernist buildings in the city. It was initially praised for its design when it opened in the 1950s by Lewis Mumford, and was considered a historic building and potential landmark by architect Robert A. M. Stern in the 1990s. In recent times, however, the building has been viewed as an \\"eyesore\\" within the Downtown Brooklyn landscape, and has fallen into disrepair as the MTA has gradually vacated the building since 1990. In 2012, New York University (NYU) reached an agreement with the MTA to take over the building and renovate and restore it to become part of its Brooklyn Campus. NYU started moving into 370 Jay Street in 2017. __TOC__ Design Jay Street‚ÄìMetroTech subway complex within the arcade of 370 Jay Street. The 13-story building was designed by architects William Haugaard and Andrew J. Thomas in the post-World War II modernist style. The building was originally designed prior to World War II, and was envisioned in the Art Deco style. The building is L-shaped, the long side along Jay Street, and the short perpendicular side along the former Myrtle Avenue. The Myrtle Avenue portion of the building is six-stories high, due to zoning restrictions at the time of the building's construction. The right-of-way of Myrtle Avenue has since been turned into a pedestrian plaza, known as Brooklyn Renaissance Plaza. A small portion of the building has three additional mechanical floors. A loading dock for the building and the entrance to its basement parking facilities is located at the north end of Pearl Street. The building is designed as a cube with flat sides and a flat roof. The roof has a narrow Monel cornice. The outer facade of the building consists of white limestone, five inches thick, with over 1,000 identical square and uniformly-arranged casement windows. These windows are laid out flush to the outer wall of the building. The windows allowed for the circulation of natural light into the building. The ground level of the building at Jay and Wiloughby Streets is designed with numerous \\"Corbusian\\" pilotis forming a semi-open-air arcade, a common characteristic of modern-style buildings. A second arcade is located at the north end of the building at Jay Street and Renaissance Plaza. =Features= Until 2015, one of the walls of the south arcade featured a 15-foot granite relief commemorating the transportation employees who fought in World War II. The relief depicts a map displaying the battle sites of the war, with the names of 85 workers who took part in those battles listed. It consists of 12 granite panels, each measuring five feet wide, 3.5 feet high, two inches thick and weighing 500 pounds. The relief was located inside the building's lobby until 1995, when it was moved to the outdoor arcade after reorganizing within the building left it obstructed from view. The memorial has since been moved to the nearby New York City Transit Authority headquarters, two blocks south at Livingston and Smith Streets. Within both arcades and adjacent to the building are several entrances to the Jay Street‚ÄìMetroTech subway complex, which consisted of two separate stations when the building was constructed. The entrances include several escalators, and the southern arcade features an elevator to the station. The unique entrance lamps featured at these subway entrances were installed along with the building, and designed in Art Deco/Art Moderne style. The foundations of the building were built on top of the IND portion of the complex, which was constructed to be able to support a heavy building on top of it. The supports for the building consist of a structural steel frame and reinforced concrete. The location was selected in order to be in close proximity to the lines of all three subway divisions (IRT, BMT, IND) in order to collect fares (including tokens and cash) via money train. Passageways from the subway stations, including a visible door in the Jay Street IND station, lead to a money sorting room in the basement of the building. Fare collection and transport was originally performed using armored trucks, and the money trains were replaced by armored trucks in 2006. Inside the building are 10 high-speed elevators installed by the Otis Elevator Company. The elevators were among the first to use the company's electronic control system, the Otis Autotronic system. Use The building was intended as the central headquarters of the New York City Board of Transportation in order to house 2,500 employees from several divisions of the board including its executive, legal, and engineering staffs. The remainder of the building not used by the BOT would be rented out. Among the operations within the building was the New York City Subway's Command Center, a centralized room on the third floor of the building used to monitor the signaling of the system. The command center has since been moved to a site in Midtown Manhattan. The upper mechanical floors housed the telephone exchange for the BOT and later the Transit Authority, the largest in the city at the time of its construction. Rented facilities included a bank (occupied by Citibank) and restaurant at ground level, which have since closed. Location The building is adjacent to the Brooklyn Friends School (occupying the former Brooklyn Law School building) and the Pearl Street campus of ASA College. To the north across Renaissance Plaza is the 355 Jay Street office building, which also houses New York Marriott Brooklyn, or the Brooklyn Bridge Hotel. Marriott owns the plaza. Across from the building to the east is One MetroTech Center, while the campus of the New York University Tandon School of Engineering is just north across the Myrtle Avenue Promenade. History =Design and construction= The \\"money train\\" door in the Jay Street IND station, leading to 370 Jay Street's money sorting room. In 1938, the Board of Transportation began plans to relocate to a central headquarters. Architectural firm Eggers & Higgins drafted the original plans for the new Board of Transportation headquarters in 1939, originally projected to cost $3.6 million. The site at Jay and Willoughby Streets was initially condemned in 1928 for the construction of the Jay Street‚ÄìBorough Hall station of the Independent Subway System (IND), with a parking lot created on the site. It was sold to a realty company involved in the building's construction by the New York City Board of Estimate at the cost of $365,000. The site was selected in anticipation of the unification of the transit system, which would occur one year later. The contract for the building was awarded to the George A. Fuller Company. Construction of the building did not commence, however, due to the onset of World War II. New plans were drafted by William Haugaard in 1948. The original design was altered, including changes to the outer facade and the addition of the arcades at both ends of the structure. The building was now being constructed as part of the greater Brooklyn Civic Center, with several other government buildings also being erected in the surrounding area. Ground broke on the site on October 8, 1948. The building was erected at a time when many other BOT transit facilities were also being built. The headquarters opened on April 1, 1951, over two years after the death of Haugaard. It cost $10 million to construct. The BOT proceeded to vacate its former headquarters, one at Hudson Street at the entrance to the Holland Tunnel in Hudson Square, Manhattan, and the other in the former Paramount Theatre in Downtown Brooklyn. On May 8, 1952, the subway entrances between the building's arcades and the Jay Street IND station, including the four escalators, were completed. In a column for The New Yorker published April 25, 1953, architectural critic Lewis Mumford praised the building's design, calling it \\"the very model of an efficient office building. Not a cathedral of commerce, not a temple of advertising, not a palace of municipal power: just a group of offices arranged for the efficient dispatch of administration.\\" =Use after dissolution of BOT= 370 Jay Street undergoing renovations in 2016. Following the dissolution of the BOT in June 1953, the building was taken over by the BOT's successors the New York City Transit Authority, who used the building as their headquarters. The Transit Authority became part of what is now the MTA in 1968, with the MTA also using the building as its center of operations. Some office space was rented out to other organizations including the New York City Police Department. In 1990, the Transit Authority moved its primary headquarters out of 370 Jay Street, to its current location at 130 Livingston Street. Other MTA operations were moved to 2 Broadway (now the headquarters of MTA Bridges and Tunnels) in Manhattan in 1998. In January 2006, the money train operations ended, after which the MTA largely vacated the site. Following the MTA's exit, the building remained largely vacant and fell into disrepair, often surrounded by scaffolding. It has been criticized for its dilapidated state, and for its simple and uniform design in contrast to the surrounding buildings. Critics of the building included Brooklyn borough president Marty Markowitz. On April 23, 2012, the MTA agreed to eventually turn the building over to New York University (NYU), with the university planning to convert the site for use as part of its Brooklyn Campus. The building will primarily house the Center for Urban Science and Progress. The original futuristic design plan for the renovation was submitted to the applied sciences competition held by mayor Michael Bloomberg and the New York City Economic Development Corporation, the same competition that led to the establishment of the Cornell Tech campus on Roosevelt Island. The original NYU design for 370 Jay Street included a \\"high-tech, high-performance\\" outer facade of glass and steel using recycled materials to improve temperature insulation, along with other energy efficient features. NYU was awarded a 99-year lease of the building. In 2014, however, NYU altered its plans to lower costs. This new redesign was created by Mitchell‚àíGiurgola Architects. The original limestone facade, which has darkened due to age and lack of maintenance, will be restored to its original white shade. The overhaul will still utilize green features, including energy-efficient windows, a wind turbine, and a green roof. Renovations began in March 2015. On October 1, 2014, MTA officials unearthed a \\"time capsule\\" at the northeast corner of the building. The capsule, a metal chest placed in a small crypt beneath a paving stone, was filled with microfilm records of the building's construction, a newspaper article, and a nickel (representing the transit fare at the time the building was built) in October 1949, and was buried in 1950. The contents were found to be damaged by water when they were removed. As part of the NYU renovation, the MTA relocated the World War II memorial to 130 Livingston Street in June 2015, and held a re-dedication ceremony in August 2015. NYU started moving into the building on December 13, 2017, at which time the renovation was expected to be completed by 2019.

Etymology  Asgardia is taken from the name of one of the Nine Worlds in the Norse religion: Asgard (). Home to the √Üsir tribe of gods, Asgard is derived from Old Norse √°ss, god and gar√∞r, enclosure; from Indo- European roots ansu- spirit, demon (see cognate ahura; also asura) and gher- grasp, enclose (see cognates garden and yard), essentially meaning \\"garden of gods.\\"; See also ansu- and gher-1 in \\"Appendix I: Indo-European Roots\\" in the same work.  History  Igor Ashurbeyli, the Head of Nation of the Space Kingdom of Asgardia = Asgardia Independent Research Center = The Asgardia Independent Research Center (AIRC), formerly the Aerospace International Research Center, was founded by Igor Ashurbeyli in 2013. In 2014, the AIRC began the publication of an international space journal, ROOM, of which Ashurbeyli is the editor-in-chief. On February 5, 2016, Ashurbeyli was awarded the UNESCO Medal for contributions to the development of nanoscience and nanotechnologies during a ceremony held at UNESCO headquarters, Paris. AIRC AAS is the only institute in Austria whose activity is fully dedicated to the research of the Solar System, extraterrestrial life and the Earth using space technology and satellite techniques. Since 2013, the AIRC staff constructed, developed and prepared for launch over 30 instruments and participated in the experiments in 15 space missions, for example: ESA's mission Mars Express, Rosetta (mission to a comet), Venus Express, BepiColombo (mission to Mercury) and CNES' DEMETER and TARANIS missions. AIRC has also collaborated with NASA for the IBEX mission. In 2015, the AIRC established a close collaboration with Asgardia. = Founding = On 12 October 2016, Ashurbeyli announced in a press conference in Paris, France, \\"the birth of the new space nation Asgardia.\\"Daniel Clery.

People were invited to register for citizenship in 2016, with the aim of Asgardia then applying to the United Nations for recognition as a nation state. In less than two days, there were over 100,000 applications; within three weeks, there were 500,000.

The Members of Parliament elect one Member to the office of \\"Chairman of the Parliament.\\" The Members of Parliament also appoint the \\"Chairman of the Government.\\" The Parliament has 12 permanent committees; the Chairman of Parliament of Asgardia is Mr. Lembit Opik. = Executive branch = The Head of Nation is the most senior official of the executive branch (i.e., the Government). The Head of Nation is elected to a 5-year term of office. The Head of Nation may dissolve the Parliament and may then order the holding of parliamentary elections. The Head of Nation may initiate legislative proposals and may veto acts adopted by the Parliament.

Its first satellite was successfully launched by Orbital ATK on 12 November 2017 as part of an International Space Station resupply mission. It is a two-unit CubeSat measuring at a weight of , manufactured and deployed into orbit by NanoRacks, and has been named . The overall goal of the mission is to demonstrate the long-term storage of data on a solid-state storage device operating in low Earth orbit. The spacecraft has a 512 gigabyte solid-state storage device. The data stored in this device will be periodically checked for data integrity and function.\\"Asgardia-1 Satellite Technical Description\\", page 1. Federal Communications Commission. Before the launch, the data storage device was loaded with things like family photos supplied by the first 1,500,000 members of Asgardia. After the spacecraft achieves Earth orbit, data can be uploaded or downloaded using the Globalstar satellite network. was boosted to space and then deployed by US companies on a NASA-funded mission so the satellite falls under US jurisdiction. Asgardia intends to partner with a non-signatory to the Outer Space Treaty (OST), perhaps an African state such as Ethiopia or Kenya, in the hopes of circumventing the OST's restriction on nation-states claiming territory in outer space. The satellite is expected to have a lifetime of 5 years before its orbit decays and it burns up on reentry.

Often described as a billionaire, Ashurbeyli has said that he is currently solely responsible for funding Asgardia, and that members will not be funding the planned first satellite launch. Although the cost has not been made publicly available, NanoRacks have said that similar projects cost $700,000. The project intends to move to crowdfunding to finance itself. Sa'id Mosteshar, of the London Institute of Space Policy and Law, says this suggests that Asgardia lacks a credible business plan. A company, Asgardia AG, has been incorporated, and members can buy shares in it. Asgardia wants to enable its founders' companies to use Asgardia's satellite network for their own services and business activities. These are to be settled via the crypto currency Solar and the reserve currency Lunar.WIRED Germany: So wird eine au√üerirdische Blockchain die Menschheit zu den Sternen f√ºhren Eventually, Asgardia hopes to have a colony in orbit. This will be expensive: the International Space Station cost $100bn to build, and flights to it cost over $40m per launch. Asgardia has been compared to the troubled Mars One project, which aims to establish a permanent colony on Mars, although Asgardia's organisers point out that setting up a small nation in orbit will be a lot easier than colonising distant Mars. Other proposed goals for the future include shielding the Earth from asteroids and coronal mass ejections, and a Moon base.  Legal status  = Historical = There has been at least one previous attempt to set up an independent nation in space. The Nation of Celestial Space, also known as Celestia, was formed in 1949 by James Mangan and claimed all of space. He banned atmospheric nuclear testing and issued protests to the major powers at their encroachment on his territory, but was ignored by both the powers and the UN. However, modern communications mean that Asgardia has a better ability to organise its claim and perhaps raise funds for the satellite that would give it a physical presence in outer space. = Current status = In a jurisdiction that does not recognise Asgardia as a legal entity, Asgardia's interests might be represented by a legal entity that has agreed to act as Asgardia's agent. A corporation organized in Austria and named Asgardia AGAsgardia AG. Herold Business Data GmbH. Retrieved 19 July 2018. has acted as Asgardia's agent. = Recognition and territorial claims = Both UN General Assembly Resolution 1962 (XVIII) and the Outer Space Treaty (OST) of 1967 have established all of outer space as an international commons by describing it as the \\"province of all mankind\\" and, as a fundamental principle of space law, declaring that space, including Moon and other astronomical objects, is not subject to any national sovereignty claim.Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, Article II, \\"Outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means.\\"Diederiks-Verschoor, I.H.Ph.; Kopal, V., An Introduction to Space Law, p26, \\"The formula epitomizes the great difference between air law and space law, with the former still embracing national sovereignty; while in the latter claims of sovereignty are banned.\\" Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty vests the responsibility for activities in space to States Parties, regardless of whether they are carried out by governments or non-governmental entities. Article VIII stipulates that the State Party to the Treaty that launches a space object shall retain jurisdiction and control over that object.Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, Article VIII, \\"A State Party to the Treaty on whose registry an object launched into outer space is carried shall retain jurisdiction and control over such object, and over any personnel thereof, while in outer space or on a celestial body.\\" According to Sa'id Mosteshar of the London Institute of Space Policy and Law: \\"The Outer Space Treaty... accepted by everybody says very clearly that no part of outer space can be appropriated by any state.\\" Without self-governing territory in space where citizens are present, Mosteshar suggested that the prospect any country would recognise Asgardia was slim. Ram Jakhu, the director of McGill University's Institute of Air and Space Law, and Asgardia's legal expert, believes that Asgardia will be able to fulfil three of the four elements that the UN requires when considering if an entity is a state: citizens; a government; and territory, being an inhabited spacecraft. In that situation, Jakhu considers that fulfilling the fourth element, gaining recognition by the UN member states, will be achievable, and Asgardia will then be able to apply for UN membership. The Security Council would then have to assess the application, as well as obtain approval from two-thirds of the members of the General Assembly. Joanne Gabrynowicz, an expert in space law and a professor at the Beijing Institute of Technology's School of Law, believes that Asgardia will have trouble attaining recognition as a nation. She says there are a \\"number of entities on Earth whose status as an independent nation have been a matter of dispute for a long time. It is reasonable to expect that the status an unpopulated object that is not on Earth will be disputed.\\" Christopher Newman, an expert in space law at the UK's University of Sunderland, highlights that Asgardia is trying to achieve a \\"complete re-visitation of the current space-law framework,\\" anticipating that the project will face significant obstacles with getting UN recognition and dealing with liability issues. The Outer Space Treaty requires the country that sends a mission into space to be responsible for the mission, including any damage it might cause. = Data security = As Asgardia is involved in the storing of private data, there could be legal and ethical issues. For the moment, as the Asgardian satellite is being deployed to orbit by US companies, it will fall under US jurisdiction and data stored on the satellite will be subject to US privacy laws. = Resident status = The Head of Government of Asgardia, Ana Mercedes D√≠az, signed and released Directive No. 1, explaining some major details of the residents' status in Asgardia for the years 2018‚Äì2019. The document provides instructions for those planning to obtain or maintain their status as a Resident of Asgardia and to take advantage of the accompanying privileges. This document is intended for all Asgardians, as well as for those who wish to become full members of the Asgardian community, residents of the first Space Nation.  Economy  The ideological component of Asgardia's economy is based on two pillars. The first: In Asgardia, citizens must become owners of the monetary system. The government is simply a middleman, broker and guarantor of monetary transactions. The second: In Asgardia, every citizen must be a participant in the distribution of the Nation's profit. = Legal currency = The Head of Nation charged his Administration to hold a contest on the main national Earth currencies in order to determine the initial rate of Solar, the cryptocurrency that will be used for Asgardians. He also charged the Government to introduce a Bill on the National Currency of Asgardia to Parliament.Decree ‚Ññ27 On the National Currency of Asgardia. ‚Äî The Head of Nation, 12 November 2018 The second Digital Parliamentary Session (the third Parliamentary session) of Asgardia, which took place on 10‚Äì12 January 2019, approved the Act of National Currency and Basic Principles of Economic and Financial System of Asgardia.

Plot  Thirty-four-year-old Aya leads a quiet life in a small Tokyo apartment with her partner, Mr. Ito, who she met when they both worked in a convenience store. One day, she is asked by her brother to look after their father for the next half year. The combined pressures of looking after their father and getting his children into a private school is proving too much for him and his wife. Aya declines, as she no longer lives alone, something of which her brother was not yet aware. When Aya gets home, her father has already arrived, however. Aya's father initially disapproves of her relationship with Mr. Ito, who is twenty years older than she is, is divorced, and works in a school cafeteria. Aya's father, himself a retired teacher, also grumbles about the fact that his daughter works in a bookshop. Difficult months follow, during which Aya comes to understand her father a little better. Her father also becomes more attached to Mr. Ito, eventually referring to him as his son-in-law. When Aya's father disappears, it is Mr. Ito who is able to track him to his family's old home outside Tokyo. After taking Aya and her brother to the old house, Mr. Ito leaves them and their father there for the night, hoping that they will be able to resolve their differences. The plan only partly succeeds, however. Father wishes to stay in the old house, yet when a bolt of lightning strikes the old fruit tree standing in its garden, both the tree and the house burn down.

Early life and education  Hodges was born in Lewisham, south east London on 11 June 1921 before moving to Westcliff-on-Sea where she was educated at Westcliff High School for Girls. Hodges read Natural Sciences at Girton College, Cambridge and graduated with an Honours degree in 1942.  Engineering career  After graduation Hodges began her career at Standard Telephone and Cables (STC) as a Junior Radio Engineer in the Radio Division, where she worked on airborne communications and the ILS blind beacon landing equipment. In 1950 Hodges joined the GEC Applied Electronics Laboratories at Stanmore, Middlesex, where she worked as a microwave and systems engineer, working on guided weapons. Hodges became Systems Manager and then Project Manager of the Guided Weapons Project (Sea Dart Guidance) in the Guided Weapons Division. Among other projects, Hodges worked in the Underwater Weapons Division on trials planning and analysis for air-launched guided torpedoes, and later worked on simulation, identifying problems affecting guided weapons systems. She was finally appointed Simulation Manager.  Retirement and later work  After her retirement in 1981, Hodges returned to professional work as a general systems consultant in the Guided Weapons Division of Marconi Space and Defence Systems (MSDS),Stanmore. Hodges was President of the Caroline Haskett Trust, which encourages young women to enter the engineering profession. It was natural, with her interest in encouraging women into engineering, that she should be a Soroptimist. She was a member of SI St Albans and District.  Work for the Women's Engineering Society  Hodges was an active member of the Women's Engineering Society, which she joined in 1960. She held various offices including Member of Council and Careers Officer, and was President of WES in 1971-3. In 1979 Hodges gave the WES Verena Holmes Lecture entitled ‚ÄòControl ‚Äì Feedback completes the circle‚Äô.  Awards and recognition  In 1969 Hodges was elected a Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society, one of three women Fellows at the time, and was also a member of the Astronautics and Guided Flight Committee. She was a Fellow of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) and a member of its Council from 1971-73. Between 1971-75 Hodges was a member of the Engineering Design Advisory Committee (EDAC) and a member of the Science Research Council Control and Instrumentation Sub-Committee between 1980 and 1982. She was elected an Honorary Fellow of the IEEIE (now part of the Institution of Engineering and Technology) in 1994. Hodges won the Whitney Straight Award in 1970 for outstanding achievement in aviation which was presented by Prince Charles and in the same year appeared in a TV film ‚ÄòMade In Britain‚Äô concerned with a ‚ÄúWoman in a Man‚Äôs World‚Äù. She was awarded an OBE in the 1972 Birthday Honours for her contribution to guided weapons technology.

It has smooth bark, often with rough, fibrous bark on the trunk, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in group of between nine and twenty one, white flowers and hemispherical or shortened spherical fruit. Description Eucalyptus remota is a tree that typically grows to a height of , sometimes a mallee to , and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth, greyish or yellow bark, usually with rough, fibrous grey bark on the trunk, sometimes also the larger branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have elliptical to egg-shaped or broadly lance-shaped leaves that are the same shade of greyish green on both sides, and long, wide. Adult leaves are the same shade of glossy green on both sides, lance-shaped to curved, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of between nine and twenty one on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval or club-shaped, long and wide with a rounded operculum that is shorter than the floral cup. Flowering occurs from November to December and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, hemispherical or shortened spherical capsule long and wide with the valves near rim level. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus remota was first formally described in 1934 William Blakely in his book, A Key to the Eucalypts from specimens collected on Kangaroo Island by Walter Gill in 1907. The specific epithet (remota) is from the Latin word remotus, referring to the location of this species being distant from those of its nearest relatives. Distribution and habitat Kangaroo Island ash is found on the western end of Kangaroo Island off the coast of South Australia where it grows on gravelly sands and loams over laterite in low mallee shrubland. It is found from Mount Taylor to Flinders Chase National Park. Use in horticulture Although not widely cultivated, E. remota is suitable for windbreaks or low shade areas and will grow quickly in sandy, acid type soils.

The relief representation depicts the personified Demos being crowned by Democracy. About 336 BC. Ancient Agora Museum. Athenian democracy developed around the sixth century BC in the Greek city-state (known as a polis) of Athens, comprising the city of Athens and the surrounding territory of Attica. Athenian democracy is often described as the first known democracy in the world. Other Greek cities set up democracies, most following the Athenian model, but none are as well documented as Athens' democracy. Athens practiced a political system of legislation and executive bills. Participation was far from open to all residents, but was instead limited to adult, male citizens (i.e., not a foreign resident, regardless of how many generations of the family had lived in the city, nor a slave, nor a woman), who \\"were probably no more than 30 percent of the total adult population\\". Solon (in 594 BC), Cleisthenes (in 508/7 BC), and Ephialtes (in 462 BC) contributed to the development of Athenian democracy. Cleisthenes broke up the power of the nobility by organizing citizens into ten groups based on where they lived, rather than on their wealth. The longest-lasting democratic leader was Pericles. After his death, Athenian democracy was twice briefly interrupted by oligarchic revolutions towards the end of the Peloponnesian War. It was modified somewhat after it was restored under Eucleides; the most detailed accounts of the system are of this fourth-century modification, rather than the Periclean system. Democracy was suppressed by the Macedonians in 322 BC. The Athenian institutions were later revived, but how close they were to a real democracy is debatable. Etymology The word \\"democracy\\" (Greek: Œ¥Œ∑ŒºŒøŒ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒØŒ±) combines the elements d√™mos (Œ¥·øÜŒºŒøœÇ, which means \\"people\\") and kr√°tos (Œ∫œÅŒ¨œÑŒøœÇ, which means \\"force\\" or \\"power\\"), and thus means literally \\"people power\\". In the words \\"monarchy\\" and \\"oligarchy\\", the second element comes from archƒì (·ºÄœÅœáŒÆ), meaning \\"beginning (that which comes first)\\", and hence also \\"first place or power\\", \\"sovereignty\\". One might expect, by analogy, that the term \\"demarchy\\" would have been adopted for the new form of government introduced by Athenian democrats. However, the word \\"demarchy\\" (Œ¥Œ∑ŒºŒ±œÅœáŒØŒ±) had already been taken and meant \\"mayoralty\\", the office or rank of a high municipal magistrate. (In present-day use, the term \\"demarchy\\" has acquired a new meaning.) It is unknown whether the word \\"democracy\\" was in existence when systems that came to be called democratic were first instituted. The first conceptual articulation of the term is generally accepted to be c. 470 BC with Aeschylus' The Suppliants (l. 604) with the line sung by the Chorus: Œ¥ŒÆŒºŒøœÖ Œ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒøœçœÉŒ± œáŒµŒπœÅ. This approximately translates as the \\"people's hand of power\\", and in the context of the play it acts as a counterpoint to the inclination of the votes cast by the people, i.e. that authority as implemented by the people in the Assembly has power. The word is then completely attested in the works of Herodotus (Histories 6.43.3) in both a verbal passive and nominal sense with the terms Œ¥Œ∑ŒºŒøŒ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒ≠ŒøŒºŒ±Œπ and Œ¥Œ∑ŒºŒøŒ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒØŒ±. Herodotus wrote some of the earliest surviving Greek prose, but this might not have been before 440 or 430 BC. Around 460 BC an individual is known with the name of Democrates,Raaflaub, Kurt A. (2007): The Breakthrough of Demokratia in Mid-Fifth-Century Athens, p. 112, in: a name possibly coined as a gesture of democratic loyalty; the name can also be found in Aeolian Temnus.Xenophon, Anabasis 4.4.15.  History  = Development = Athens was never the only polis in Ancient Greece that instituted a democratic regime. Aristotle points to other cities that adopted governments in the democratic style. However, accounts of the rise of democratic institutions are in reference to Athens, since only this city-state had sufficient historical records to speculate on the rise and nature of Greek democracy.Clarke, PB. and Foweraker, Encyclopedia of Democratic Thought. Routledge, 2003, p. 196. Before the first attempt at democratic government, Athens was ruled by a series of archons or chief magistrates, and the Areopagus, made up of ex-archons. The members of these institutions were generally aristocrats. In 621 BC, Draco replaced the prevailing system of oral law by a written code to be enforced only by a court of law.Thorley, J., Athenian Democracy, Routledge, 2005, p.10.Farrar, C., The Origins of Democratic Thinking: The Invention of Politics in Classical Athens, CUP Archive, 25 Aug 1989, p.7. In 594 BC, Solon, premier archon at the time, issued reforms that defined citizenship in a way that gave each free resident of Attica a political function: Athenian citizens had the right to participate in assembly meetings. By granting the formerly aristocratic role to every free citizen of Athens who owned property, Solon reshaped the social framework of the city-state. Under these reforms, the boule (a council of 400 members, with 100 citizens from each of Athens's four tribes) ran daily affairs and set the political agenda. The Areopagus, which formerly took on this role, remained but thereafter carried on the role of \\"guardianship of the laws\\".Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Areopagus. Another major contribution to democracy was Solon's setting up of an Ecclesia or Assembly, which was open to all the male citizens. Cleisthenes In 561 BC, the nascent democracy was overthrown by the tyrant Peisistratos but was reinstated after the expulsion of his son, Hippias, in 510. Cleisthenes issued reforms in 508 and 507 BC that undermined the domination of the aristocratic families and connected every Athenian to the city's rule. Cleisthenes formally identified free inhabitants of Attica as citizens of Athens, which gave them power and a role in a sense of civic solidarity.Farrar, C., The Origins of Democratic Thinking: The Invention of Politics in Classical Athens, CUP Archive, 25 Aug 1989, p.21. He did this by making the traditional tribes politically irrelevant and instituting ten new tribes, each made up of about three trittyes, each consisting of several demes. Every male citizen over 18 had to be registered in his deme.Thorley, J., Athenian Democracy, Routledge, 2005, p.25. The third set of reforms was instigated by Ephialtes in 462/1. While Ephialtes's opponents were away attempting to assist the Spartans, he persuaded the Assembly to reduce the powers of the Areopagus to a criminal court for cases of homicide and sacrilege. At the same time or soon afterward, the membership of the Areopagus was extended to the lower level of the propertied citizenship.Thorley, J., Athenian Democracy, Routledge, 2005, pp. 55‚Äì56 In the wake of Athens's disastrous defeat in the Sicilian campaign in 413 BC, a group of citizens took steps to limit the radical democracy they thought was leading the city to ruin. Their efforts, initially conducted through constitutional channels, culminated in the establishment of an oligarchy, the Council of 400, in the Athenian coup of 411 BC. The oligarchy endured for only four months before it was replaced by a more democratic government. Democratic regimes governed until Athens surrendered to Sparta in 404 BC, when the government was placed in the hands of the so-called Thirty Tyrants, who were pro-Spartan oligarchs. After a year, pro-democracy elements regained control, and democratic forms persisted until the Macedonian army of Phillip II conquered Athens in 338 BC. =Aftermath= Alexander the Great had led a coalition of the Greek states to war with Persia in 336 BC, but his Greek soldiers were hostages for the behavior of their states as much as allies. His relations with Athens were already strained when he returned to Babylon in 324 BC; after his death, Athens and Sparta led several states to war with Macedonia and lost.Habicht, C., Athens from Alexander to Antony, Harvard University Press, 1997, p. 42. This led to the Hellenistic control of Athens, with the Macedonian king appointing a local agent as political governor in Athens. However, the governors, like Demetrius of Phalerum, appointed by Cassander, kept some of the traditional institutions in formal existence, although the Athenian public would consider them to be nothing more than Macedonian puppet dictators. Once Demetrius Poliorcetes ended Cassander's rule over Athens, Demetrius of Phalerum went into exile and the democracy was restored in 307 BC. However, by now Athens had become \\"politically impotent\\".Green, P., Alexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Hellenistic Age, University of California Press, 1993, p.29. An example of this was that, in 307, in order to curry favour with Macedonia and Egypt, three new tribes were created, two in honour of the Macedonian king and his son, and the other in honour of the Egyptian king. However, when Rome fought Macedonia in 200, the Athenians abolished the first two new tribes and created a twelfth tribe in honour of the Pergamene king. The Athenians declared for Rome, and in 146 BC Athens became an autonomous civitas foederata, able to manage internal affairs. This allowed Athens to practice the forms of democracy, though Rome ensured that the constitution strengthened the city's aristocracy.A Companion to Greek Studies, CUP Archive, p. 447. Under Roman rule, the archons ranked as the highest officials. They were elected, and even foreigners such as Domitian and Hadrian held the office as a mark of honour. Four presided over the judicial administration. The council (whose numbers varied at different times from 300 to 750) was appointed by lot. It was superseded in importance by the Areopagus, which, recruited from the elected archons, had an aristocratic character and was entrusted with wide powers. From the time of Hadrian, an imperial curator superintended the finances. The shadow of the old constitution lingered on and Archons and Areopagus survived the fall of the Roman Empire. In 88 BC, there was a revolution under the philosopher Athenion, who, as tyrant, forced the Assembly to agree to elect whomever he might ask to office. Athenion allied with Mithridates of Pontus and went to war with Rome; he was killed during the war and was replaced by Aristion. The victorious Roman general, Publius Cornelius Sulla, left the Athenians their lives and did not sell them into slavery; he also restored the previous government, in 86 BC.Cartledge, P, Garnsey, P. and Gruen, ES., Hellenistic Constructs: Essays in Culture, History, and Historiography, University of California Press, 1997, Ch. 5. After Rome became an Empire under Augustus, the nominal independence of Athens dissolved and its government converged to the normal type for a Roman municipality, with a Senate of decuriones.Habicht, passim Participation and exclusion =Size and make-up of the Athenian population= Estimates of the population of ancient Athens vary. During the 4th century BC, there might well have been some 250,000‚Äì300,000 people in Attica. Citizen families could have amounted to 100,000 people and out of these some 30,000 would have been the adult male citizens entitled to vote in the assembly. In the mid-5th century the number of adult male citizens was perhaps as high as 60,000, but this number fell precipitously during the Peloponnesian War.Rothchild, JA., Introduction to Athenian Democracy of the Fifth and Fourth Centuries BCE. This slump was permanent, due to the introduction of a stricter definition of citizen described below. From a modern perspective these figures may seem small, but among Greek city-states Athens was huge: most of the thousand or so Greek cities could only muster 1000‚Äì1500 adult male citizens each; and Corinth, a major power, had at most 15,000.Dixon, MD., Late Classical and Early Hellenistic Corinth: 338‚Äì196 BC, Routledge, 2014, p. 44. The non-citizen component of the population was made up of resident foreigners (metics) and slaves, with the latter perhaps somewhat more numerous. Around 338 BC the orator Hyperides (fragment 13) claimed that there were 150,000 slaves in Attica, but this figure is probably no more than an impression: slaves outnumbered those of citizen stock but did not swamp them.Kamen, D., Status in Classical Athens, Princeton University Press, 2013 p. 9. =Citizenship in Athens= Only adult male Athenian citizens who had completed their military training as ephebes had the right to vote in Athens. The percentage of the population that actually participated in the government was 10% to 20% of the total number of inhabitants, but this varied from the fifth to the fourth century BC. This excluded a majority of the population: slaves, freed slaves, children, women and metics (foreign residents in Athens).agathe.gr: The Unenfranchised II ‚Äì Slaves and Resident Aliens The women had limited rights and privileges, had restricted movement in public, and were very segregated from the men.agathe.gr: The Unenfranchised I ‚Äì Women Also excluded from voting were citizens whose rights were under suspension (typically for failure to pay a debt to the city: see atimia); for some Athenians, this amounted to permanent (and in fact inheritable) disqualification. Given the exclusive and ancestral concept of citizenship held by Greek city-states, a relatively large portion of the population took part in the government of Athens and of other radical democracies like it, compared to oligarchies and aristocracies. Some Athenian citizens were far more active than others, but the vast numbers required for the system to work testify to a breadth of direct participation among those eligible that greatly surpassed any present-day democracy. Athenian citizens had to be descended from citizens; after the reforms of Pericles and Cimon in 450 BC, only those descended from two Athenian parents could claim citizenship.Thorley, J., Athenian Democracy, Routledge, 2005, p.59. Although the legislation was not retrospective, five years later, when a free gift of grain had arrived from the Egyptian king to be distributed among all citizens, many \\"illegitimate\\" citizens were removed from the registers. Cohen D. and Gagarin, M., The Cambridge Companion to Ancient Greek Law Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 278. Citizenship applied to both individuals and their descendants. It could also be granted by the assembly and was sometimes given to large groups (e.g. Plateans in 427 BC and Samians in 405 BC). However, by the 4th century, citizenship was given only to individuals and by a special vote with a quorum of 6000. This was generally done as a reward for some service to the state. In the course of a century, the number of citizenships so granted was in the hundreds rather than thousands.Sinclair, RK.,Democracy and Participation in Athens, Cambridge University Press, 30 Aug 1991, pp. 25‚Äì26. Main bodies of government Constitution of the Athenians, 4th century BCThere were three political bodies where citizens gathered in numbers running into the hundreds or thousands. These are the assembly (in some cases with a quorum of 6000), the council of 500 (boule), and the courts (a minimum of 200 people, on some occasions up to 6,000). Of these three bodies, the assembly and the courts were the true sites of power ‚Äì although courts, unlike the assembly, were never simply called the demos ('the people'), as they were manned by just those citizens over thirty. Crucially, citizens voting in both were not subject to review and prosecution, as were council members and all other officeholders. In the 5th century BC, there is often a record of the assembly sitting as a court of judgment itself for trials of political importance and it is not a coincidence that 6,000 is the number both for the full quorum for the assembly and for the annual pool from which jurors were picked for particular trials. By the mid-4th century, however, the assembly's judicial functions were largely curtailed, though it always kept a role in the initiation of various kinds of political trial. =Ecclesia= The central events of the Athenian democracy were the meetings of the assembly (, ekkles√≠a). Unlike a parliament, the assembly's members were not elected, but attended by right when they chose. Greek democracy created at Athens was direct, rather than representative: any adult male citizen over the age of 20 could take part,Thorley, J., Athenian Democracy, Routledge, 2005, p.32. and it was a duty to do so. The officials of the democracy were in part elected by the Assembly and in large part chosen by lottery in a process called sortition. The assembly had four main functions: it made executive pronouncements (decrees, such as deciding to go to war or granting citizenship to a foreigner), elected some officials, legislated, and tried political crimes. As the system evolved, the last function was shifted to the law courts. The standard format was that of speakers making speeches for and against a position, followed by a general vote (usually by show of hands) of yes or no. Though there might be blocs of opinion, sometimes enduring, on important matters, there were no political parties and likewise no government or opposition (as in the Westminster system). Voting was by simple majority. In the 5th century at least, there were scarcely any limits on the power exercised by the assembly. If the assembly broke the law, the only thing that might happen is that it would punish those who had made the proposal that it had agreed to. If a mistake had been made, from the assembly's viewpoint it could only be because it had been misled.Thorley, J., Athenian Democracy, Routledge, 2005, p.57. As usual in ancient democracies, one had to physically attend a gathering in order to vote. Military service or simple distance prevented the exercise of citizenship. Voting was usually by show of hands (œáŒµŒπœÅŒøœÑŒøŒΩŒØŒ±, kheirotonia, 'arm stretching') with officials judging the outcome by sight. This could cause problems when it became too dark to see properly. However, any member could demand that officials issue a recount.Thorley, J., Athenian Democracy, Routledge, 2005, p 33‚Äì34. For a small category of votes, a quorum of 6,000 was required, principally grants of citizenship, and here small coloured stones were used, white for yes and black for no. At the end of the session, each voter tossed one of these into a large clay jar which was afterwards cracked open for the counting of the ballots. Ostracism required the voters to scratch names onto pieces of broken pottery (·ΩÑœÉœÑœÅŒ±Œ∫Œ±, ostraka), though this did not occur within the assembly as such. The Pnyx with the speaker's platform, the meeting place of the people of Athens. In the 5th century BC, there were 10 fixed assembly meetings per year, one in each of the ten state months, with other meetings called as needed. In the following century, the meetings were set to forty a year, with four in each state month. One of these was now called the main meeting, kyria ekklesia. Additional meetings might still be called, especially as up until 355 BC there were still political trials that were conducted in the assembly, rather than in court. The assembly meetings did not occur at fixed intervals, as they had to avoid clashing with the annual festivals that followed the lunar calendar. There was also a tendency for the four meetings to be aggregated toward the end of each state month.Manville, PB., The Origins of Citizenship in Ancient Athens, Princeton University Press, 2014 p. 182. Attendance at the assembly was not always voluntary. In the 5th century, public slaves forming a cordon with a red-stained rope herded citizens from the agora into the assembly meeting place (Pnyx), with a fine being imposed on those who got the red on their clothes.Aristophanes Acharnians 17‚Äì22. After the restoration of the democracy in 403 BC, pay for assembly attendance was introduced. This promoted a new enthusiasm for assembly meetings. Only the first 6,000 to arrive were admitted and paid, with the red rope now used to keep latecomers at bay.Aristoph. Ekklesiazousai 378-9 =The Boule= In 594 BC, Solon is said to have created a boule of 400 to guide the work of the assembly.Terry Buckley, Aspects of Greek History: A Source-Based Approach, Routledge, 2006, p. 98. After the reforms of Cleisthenes, the Athenian Boule was expanded to 500 and was elected by lot every year. Each of Cleisthenes's 10 tribes provided 50 councilors who were at least 30 years old. The Boule's roles in public affairs included finance, maintaining the military's cavalry and fleet of ships, advising the generals, approving of newly elected magistrates, and receiving ambassadors. Most importantly, the Boule would draft probouleumata, or deliberations for the Ecclesia to discuss and approve on. During emergencies, the Ecclesia would also grant special temporary powers to the Boule.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: boule. Cleisthenes restricted the Boule's membership to those of zeugitai status (and above), presumably because these classes' financial interests gave them an incentive towards effective governance. A member had to be approved by his deme, each of which would have an incentive to select those with experience in local politics and the greatest likelihood at effective participation in government.Thorley, J., Athenian Democracy, Routledge, 2005, pp. 31‚Äì32 The members from each of the ten tribes in the Boule took it in turns to act as a standing committee (the prytaneis) of the Boule for a period of thirty-six days. All fifty members of the prytaneis on duty were housed and fed in the tholos of the Prytaneion, a building adjacent to the bouleuterion, where the boule met. A chairman for each tribe was chosen by lot each day, who was required to stay in the tholos for the next 24 hours, presiding over meetings of the Boule and Assembly.Thorley, J., Athenian Democracy, Routledge, 2005, pp. 30‚Äì31. The boule also served as an executive committee for the assembly, and oversaw the activities of certain other magistrates. The boule coordinated the activities of the various boards and magistrates that carried out the administrative functions of Athens and provided from its own membership randomly selected boards of ten responsible for areas ranging from naval affairs to religious observances.Hignett, History of the Athenian Constitution, 238 Altogether, the boule was responsible for a great portion of the administration of the state, but was granted relatively little latitude for initiative; the boule's control over policy was executed in its probouleutic, rather than its executive function; in the former, it prepared measures for deliberation by the assembly, in the latter, it merely executed the wishes of the assembly.Hignett, History of the Athenian Constitution, 241 =Courts= Athens had an elaborate legal system centered on full citizen rights (see atimia). The age limit of 30 or older, the same as that for office holders but ten years older than that required for participation in the assembly, gave the courts a certain standing in relation to the assembly. Jurors were required to be under oath, which was not required for attendance at the assembly. The authority exercised by the courts had the same basis as that of the assembly: both were regarded as expressing the direct will of the people. Unlike office holders (magistrates), who could be impeached and prosecuted for misconduct, the jurors could not be censured, for they, in effect, were the people and no authority could be higher than that. A corollary of this was that, at least acclaimed by defendants, if a court had made an unjust decision, it must have been because it had been misled by a litigant.Dover, KJ., Greek Popular Morality in the Time of Plato and Aristotle, Hackett Publishing, 1994, p.23. Essentially there were two grades of a suit, a smaller kind known as dike (Œ¥ŒØŒ∫Œ∑) or private suit, and a larger kind known as graphe or public suit. For private suits, the minimum jury size was 200 (increased to 401 if a sum of over 1000 drachmas was at issue), for public suits 501. Under Cleisthenes's reforms, juries were selected by lot from a panel of 600 jurors, there being 600 jurors from each of the ten tribes of Athens, making a jury pool of 6000 in total.Thorley, J., Athenian Democracy, Routledge, 2005, pp. 36‚Äì38. For particularly important public suits the jury could be increased by adding in extra allotments of 500. 1000 and 1500 are regularly encountered as jury sizes and on at least one occasion, the first time a new kind of case was brought to court (see graphƒì paran√≥m≈çn), all 6,000 members of the jury pool may have attended to one case.MacDowell, DM., The Law in Classical Athens, Cornell University Press, 1978, p.36. Water Clock in the Ancient Agora of Athens. The cases were put by the litigants themselves in the form of an exchange of single speeches timed by a water clock or clepsydra, first prosecutor then defendant. In a public suit the litigants each had three hours to speak, much less in private suits (though here it was in proportion to the amount of money at stake). Decisions were made by voting without any time set aside for deliberation. Jurors did talk informally amongst themselves during the voting procedure and juries could be rowdy, shouting out their disapproval or disbelief of things said by the litigants. This may have had some role in building a consensus. The jury could only cast a 'yes' or 'no' vote as to the guilt and sentence of the defendant. For private suits only the victims or their families could prosecute, while for public suits anyone (ho boulomenos, 'whoever wants to' i.e. any citizen with full citizen rights) could bring a case since the issues in these major suits were regarded as affecting the community as a whole. Justice was rapid: a case could last no longer than one day and had to be completed by the time the sun set.Bertoch, MJ., The Greeks had a jury for it, ABA Journal, October, 1971, Vol. 57, p.1013. Some convictions triggered an automatic penalty, but where this was not the case the two litigants each proposed a penalty for the convicted defendant and the jury chose between them in a further vote.Arnason, JP., Raaflaub, KA. and Wagner, P., The Greek Polis and the Invention of Democracy: A Politico-cultural Transformation and Its Interpretations, John Wiley & Sons, 2013' p. 167. No appeal was possible. There was however a mechanism for prosecuting the witnesses of a successful prosecutor, which it appears could lead to the undoing of the earlier verdict. Payment for jurors was introduced around 462 BC and is ascribed to Pericles, a feature described by Aristotle as fundamental to radical democracy (Politics 1294a37). Pay was raised from 2 to 3 obols by Cleon early in the Peloponnesian war and there it stayed; the original amount is not known. Notably, this was introduced more than fifty years before payment for attendance at assembly meetings. Running the courts was one of the major expenses of the Athenian state and there were moments of financial crisis in the 4th century when the courts, at least for private suits, had to be suspended.Rhodes, PJ., A History of the Classical Greek World: 478 ‚Äì 323 BC, John Wiley & Sons, 2011, p. 235. The system showed a marked anti-professionalism. No judges presided over the courts, nor did anyone give legal direction to the jurors. Magistrates had only an administrative function and were laymen. Most of the annual magistracies in Athens could only be held once in a lifetime. There were no lawyers as such; litigants acted solely in their capacity as citizens. Whatever professionalism there was tended to disguise itself; it was possible to pay for the services of a speechwriter or logographer (logographos), but this may not have been advertised in court. Jurors would likely be more impressed if it seemed as though litigants were speaking for themselves.MacDowell, DM., The Law in Classical Athens, Cornell University Press, 1978, p.250. =Shifting balance between assembly and courts= As the system evolved, the courts (that is, citizens under another guise) intruded upon the power of the assembly. Starting in 355 BC, political trials were no longer held in the assembly, but only in a court. In 416 BC, the graphƒì paran√≥m≈çn ('indictment against measures contrary to the laws') was introduced. Under this, anything passed or proposed by the assembly could be put on hold for review before a jury ‚Äì which might annul it and perhaps punish the proposer as well. Remarkably, it seems that blocking and then successfully reviewing a measure was enough to validate it without needing the assembly to vote on it. For example, two men have clashed in the assembly about a proposal put by one of them; it passes, and now the two of them go to court with the loser in the assembly prosecuting both the law and its proposer. The quantity of these suits was enormous. The courts became in effect a kind of upper house. In the 5th century, there were no procedural differences between an executive decree and a law. They were both simply passed by the assembly. However, beginning in 403 BC, they were set sharply apart. Henceforth, laws were made not in the assembly, but by special panels of citizens drawn from the annual jury pool of 6,000. These were known as the nomothetai (ŒΩŒøŒºŒøŒ∏Œ≠œÑŒ±Œπ, 'the lawmakers').Thorley, J., Athenian Democracy, Routledge, 2005, p.60. =Citizen-initiator= The institutions sketched above ‚Äì assembly, officeholders, council, courts ‚Äì are incomplete without the figure that drove the whole system, Ho boulomenos ('he who wishes', or 'anyone who wishes'). This expression encapsulated the right of citizens to take the initiative to stand to speak in the assembly, to initiate a public lawsuit (that is, one held to affect the political community as a whole), to propose a law before the lawmakers, or to approach the council with suggestions. Unlike officeholders, the citizen initiator was not voted on before taking up office or automatically reviewed after stepping down; these institutions had, after all, no set tenure and might be an action lasting only a moment. However, any stepping forward into the democratic limelight was risky. If another citizen initiator chose, a public figure could be called to account for their actions and punished. In situations involving a public figure, the initiator was referred to as a kategoros ('accuser'), a term also used in cases involving homicide, rather than ho diokon ('the one who pursues').Cohen D. and Gagarin, M., The Cambridge Companion to Ancient Greek Law Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 130. Pericles, according to Thucydides, characterized the Athenians as being very well-informed on politics: > We do not say that a man who takes no interest in politics is a man who > minds his own business; we say that he has no business here at all.\\"Funeral > Oration\\", Thucydides II.40, trans. Rex Warner (1954). The word idiot originally simply meant \\"private citizen\\"; in combination with its more recent meaning of \\"foolish person\\", this is sometimes used by modern commentators to demonstrate that the ancient Athenians considered those who did not participate in politics as foolish.Goldhill, S., 2004, The Good Citizen, in Love, Sex & Tragedy: Why Classics Matters. John Murray, London, 179-94. But the sense history of the word does not support this interpretation.see Idiot#Etymology Although, voters under Athenian democracy were allowed the same opportunity to voice their opinion and to sway the discussion, they were not always successful, and, often, the minority was forced to vote in favor of a motion that they did not agree with. =Archons and the Areopagus= Just before the reforms of Solon in the 7th century BC, Athens was governed by a few archons (three, then later nine) and the council of the Areopagus, which was composed of members powerful noble families. While there seems to have also been a type of citizen assembly (presumably of the hoplite class), the archons and the body of the Areopagus ran the state and the mass of people had no say in government at all before these reforms.Thorley, J., Athenian Democracy, Routledge, 2005, pp. 8‚Äì9. Solon's reforms allowed the archons to come from some of the higher propertied classes and not only from the aristocratic families. Since the Areopagus was made up of ex-archons, this would eventually mean the weakening of the hold of the nobles there as well. However, even with Solon's creation of the citizen's assembly, the Archons and Areopagus still wielded a great deal of power.Sinclair, RK., Democracy and Participation in Athens, Cambridge University Press, 30 Aug 1991, pp. 1‚Äì2. The reforms of Cleisthenes meant that the archons were elected by the Assembly, but were still selected from the upper classes.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: archon The Areopagus kept its power as 'Guardian of the Laws', which meant that it could veto actions it deemed unconstitutional, however, this worked in practice.Thorley, J., Athenian Democracy, Routledge, 2005, p. 55. Ephialtes, and later Pericles, stripped the Areopagus of its role in supervising and controlling the other institutions, dramatically reducing its power. In the play The Eumenides, performed in 458, Aeschylus, himself a noble, portrays the Areopagus as a court established by Athena herself, an apparent attempt to preserve the dignity of the Areopagus in the face of its disempowerment. =Officeholders= Approximately 1100 citizens (including the members of the council of 500) held office each year. They were mostly chosen by lot, with a much smaller (and more prestigious) group of about 100 elected. Neither was compulsory; individuals had to nominate themselves for both selection methods. In particular, those chosen by lot were citizens acting without particular expertise. This was almost inevitable since, with the notable exception of the generals (strategoi), each office had restrictive term limits. For example, a citizen could only be a member of the Boule in two non-consecutive years in their life.Thorley, J., Athenian Democracy, Routledge, 2005, p.29. In addition, there were some limitations on who could hold office. Age restrictions were in place with thirty years as a minimum, rendering about a third of the adult citizen body ineligible at any one time. An unknown proportion of citizens were also subject to disenfranchisement (atimia), excluding some of them permanently and others temporarily (depending on the type). Furthermore, all citizens selected were reviewed before taking up office (dokimasia) at which time they might be disqualified. While citizens voting in the assembly were free of review or punishment, those same citizens when holding an office served the people and could be punished very severely. In addition to being subject to review prior to holding office, officeholders were also subject to an examination after leaving office (euthunai, 'straightenings' or 'submission of accounts') to review their performance. Both of these processes were in most cases brief and formulaic, but they opened up the possibility of a contest before a jury court if some citizen wanted to take a matter up.Thorley, J., Athenian Democracy, Routledge, 2005, pp. 42‚Äì43. In the case of scrutiny going to trial, there was the risk for the former officeholder of suffering severe penalties. Even during his period of office, any officeholder could be impeached and removed from office by the assembly. In each of the ten \\"main meetings\\" (kuriai ekklesiai) a year, the question was explicitly raised in the assembly agenda: were the office holders carrying out their duties correctly? Citizens active as officeholders served in a quite different capacity from when they voted in the assembly or served as jurors. By and large, the power exercised by these officials was routine administration and quite limited. These officeholders were the agents of the people, not their representatives, so their role was that of administration, rather than governing. The powers of officials were precisely defined and their capacity for initiative limited. When it came to penal sanctions, no officeholder could impose a fine over fifty drachmas. Anything higher had to go before a court. Competence does not seem to have been the main issue, but rather, at least in the 4th century BC, whether they were loyal democrats or had oligarchic tendencies. Part of the ethos of democracy, rather, was the building of general competence by ongoing involvement. In the 5th century setup, the ten annually elected generals were often very prominent, but for those who had power, it lay primarily in their frequent speeches and in the respect accorded them in the assembly, rather than their vested powers. Selection by lot The allotment of an individual was based on citizenship, rather than merit or any form of personal popularity which could be bought. Allotment, therefore, was seen as a means to prevent the corrupt purchase of votes and it gave citizens political equality, as all had an equal chance of obtaining government office. This also acted as a check against demagoguery, though this check was imperfect and did not prevent elections from involving pandering to voters.Samons, L., What's Wrong with Democracy?: From Athenian Practice to American Worship, University of California Press, 2004, pp. 44‚Äì45. The random assignment of responsibility to individuals who may or may not be competent has obvious risks, but the system included features meant to mitigate possible problems. Athenians selected for office served as teams (boards, panels). In a group, one person is more likely to know the right way to do things and those that do not may learn from those that do. During the period of holding a particular office, everyone on the team would be observing everybody else as a sort of check. However, there were officials, such as the nine archons, who while seemingly a board carried out very different functions from each other. No office appointed by lot could be held twice by the same individual. The only exception was the boule or council of 500. In this case, simply by demographic necessity, an individual could serve twice in a lifetime. This principle extended down to the secretaries and undersecretaries who served as assistants to magistrates such as the archons. To the Athenians, it seems what had to be guarded against was not incompetence but any tendency to use the office as a way of accumulating ongoing power.Raaflaub, Kurt A., Ober, Josiah and Wallace Robert W., Origins of Democracy in Ancient Greece, University of California Press, 2007 p. 182. Election Bust of Pericles, marble Roman copy after a Greek original from c. 430 BC During an Athenian election, approximately one hundred officials out of a thousand were elected rather than chosen by lot. There were two main categories in this group: those required to handle large sums of money, and the 10 generals, the strategoi. One reason that financial officials were elected was that any money embezzled could be recovered from their estates; election in general strongly favoured the rich, but in this case, wealth was virtually a prerequisite. Generals were elected not only because their role required expert knowledge, but also because they needed to be people with experience and contacts in the wider Greek world where wars were fought. In the 5th century BC, principally as seen through the figure of Pericles, the generals could be among the most powerful people in the polis. Yet in the case of Pericles, it is wrong to see his power as coming from his long series of annual generalships (each year along with nine others). His officeholding was rather an expression and a result of the influence he wielded. That influence was based on his relation with the assembly, a relation that in the first instance lay simply in the right of any citizen to stand and speak before the people. Under the 4th century version of democracy, the roles of general and of key political speaker in the assembly tended to be filled by different persons. In part, this was a consequence of the increasingly specialized forms of warfare practiced in the later period. Elected officials, too, were subject to review before holding office and scrutiny after office. And they could also be removed from office at any time that the assembly met. There was even a death penalty for \\"inadequate performance\\" while in office. Criticism Athenian democracy has had many critics, both ancient and modern. Ancient Greek critics of Athenian democracy include Thucydides the general and historian, Aristophanes the playwright, Plato the pupil of Socrates, Aristotle the pupil of Plato, and a writer known as the Old Oligarch. While modern critics are more likely to find fault with the restrictive qualifications for political involvement, these ancients viewed democracy as being too inclusive. For them, the common people were not necessarily the right people to rule and were likely to make huge mistakes. According to Samons: > The modern desire to look to Athens for lessons or encouragement for modern > thought, government, or society must confront this strange paradox: the > people that gave rise to and practiced ancient democracy left us almost > nothing but criticism of this form of regime (on a philosophical or > theoretical level). And what is more, the actual history of Athens in the > period of its democratic government is marked by numerous failures, > mistakes, and misdeeds‚Äîmost infamously, the execution of Socrates‚Äîthat would > seem to discredit the ubiquitous modern idea that democracy leads to good > government.Samons, L., What's Wrong with Democracy?: From Athenian Practice > to American Worship, University of California Press, 2004, p. 6. Thucydides, from his aristocratic and historical viewpoint, reasoned that a serious flaw in democratic government was that the common people were often much too credulous about even contemporary facts to rule justly, in contrast to his own critical-historical approach to history. For example, he points to errors regarding Sparta; Athenians erroneously believed that Sparta's kings each had two votes in their ruling council and that there existed a Spartan battalion called Pitanate lochos. To Thucydides, this carelessness was due to common peoples' \\"preference for ready-made accounts\\".Ober, J., Dissent in Democratic Athens: Intellectual Critics of Popular Rule, Princeton University Press, 2001, pp. 54 & 78‚Äì79. Similarly, Plato and Aristotle criticized democratic rule as the numerically preponderant poor tyrannizing the rich. Instead of seeing it as a fair system under which everyone has equal rights, they regarded it as manifestly unjust. In Aristotle's works, this is categorized as the difference between 'arithmetic' and 'geometric' (i.e. proportional) equality.Kagan, D., https://books.google.com/books?id=z9garz74CJ0C&dq;=athens+kagan&q;=%22Plato+and+Aristotle+must%22#v=snippet&q;=%22Plato%20and%20Aristotle%20must%22&f;=false The Fall of the Athenian Empire, Cornell University Press, 2013, p. 108.] To its ancient detractors, rule by the demos was also reckless and arbitrary. Two examples demonstrate this: *In 406 BC, after years of defeats in the wake of the annihilation of their vast invasion force in Sicily, the Athenians at last won a naval victory at Arginusae over the Spartans. After the battle, a storm arose and the generals in command failed to collect survivors. The Athenians tried and sentenced six of the eight generals to death. Technically, it was illegal, as the generals were tried and sentenced together, rather than one by one as Athenian law required. Socrates happened to be the citizen presiding over the assembly that day and refused to cooperate (though to little effect) and stood against the idea that it was outrageous for the people to be unable to do whatever they wanted. In addition to this unlawful injustice, the demos later on regretted the decision and decided that they had been misled. Those charged with misleading the demos were put on trial, including the author of the motion to try the generals together.Hobden, F. and Tuplin, C., Xenophon: Ethical Principles and Historical Enquiry, BRILL, 2012, pp. 196‚Äì199. *In 399 BC, Socrates himself was put on trial and executed for \\"corrupting the young and believing in strange gods\\". His death gave Europe one of the first intellectual martyrs still recorded, but guaranteed the democracy an eternity of bad press at the hands of his disciple and enemy to democracy, Plato. From Socrates's arguments at his trial, Loren Samons writes, \\"It follows, of course, that any majority‚Äîincluding the majority of jurors‚Äîis unlikely to choose rightly.\\" However, \\"some might argue, Athens is the only state that can claim to have produced a Socrates. Surely, some might continue, we may simply write off events such as Socrates' execution as examples of the Athenians' failure to realize fully the meaning and potential of their own democracy.\\"Samons, L., What's Wrong with Democracy?: From Athenian Practice to American Worship, University of California Press, 2004, p. 12 & 195. While Plato blamed democracy for killing Socrates, his criticisms of the rule of the demos were much more extensive. Much of his writings were about his alternatives to democracy. His The Republic, The Statesman, and Laws contained many arguments against democratic rule and in favour of a much narrower form of government: \\"The organization of the city must be confided to those who possess knowledge, who alone can enable their fellow-citizens to attain virtue, and therefore excellence, by means of education.\\"Beck, H., Companion to Ancient Greek Government, John Wiley & Sons, 2013, p. 103. Whether the democratic failures should be seen as systemic, or as a product of the extreme conditions of the Peloponnesian war, there does seem to have been a move toward correction. A new version of democracy was established in 403 BC, but it can be linked with both earlier and subsequent reforms (graphƒì paran√≥m≈çn 416 BC; end of assembly trials 355 BC). For instance, the system of nomothesia was introduced. In this: Increasingly, responsibility was shifted from the assembly to the courts, with laws being made by jurors and all assembly decisions becoming reviewable by courts. That is to say, the mass meeting of all citizens lost some ground to gatherings of a thousand or so which were under oath, and with more time to focus on just one matter (though never more than a day). One downside to this change was that the new democracy was less capable of responding quickly in times where quick, decisive action was needed. Another tack of criticism is to notice the disquieting links between democracy and a number of less than appealing features of Athenian life. Although democracy predated Athenian imperialism by over thirty years, they are sometimes associated with each other. For much of the 5th century at least, democracy fed off an empire of subject states. Thucydides the son of Milesias (not the historian), an aristocrat, stood in opposition to these policies, for which he was ostracised in 443 BC. At times the imperialist democracy acted with extreme brutality, as in the decision to execute the entire male population of Melos and sell off its women and children simply for refusing to become subjects of Athens. The common people were numerically dominant in the navy, which they used to pursue their own interests in the form of work as rowers and in the hundreds of overseas administrative positions. Furthermore, they used the income from empire to fund payment for officeholding. This is the position set out by the anti-democratic pamphlet known whose anonymous author is often called the Old Oligarch. This writer (also called pseudo-Xenophon) produced several comments critical of democracy, such as:Ober, J., Political Dissent in Democratic Athens: Intellectual Critics of Popular Rule, Princeton University Press, 2001, p. 43. # Democratic rule acts in the benefit of smaller self-interested factions, rather than the entire polis. # Collectivizing political responsibility lends itself to both dishonest practices and scapegoating individuals when measures become unpopular. # By being inclusive, opponents to the system become naturally included within the democratic framework, meaning democracy itself will generate few opponents, despite its flaws. # A democratic Athens with an imperial policy will spread the desire for democracy outside of the polis. # The democratic government depends on the control of resources, which requires military power and material exploitation. # The values of freedom of equality include non-citizens more than it should. # By blurring the distinction between the natural and political world, democracy leads the powerful to act immorally and outside their own best interest. Aristotle also wrote about what he considered to be a better form of government than democracy. Rather than any citizen partaking with an equal share in the rule, he thought that those who were more virtuous should have greater power in governance.Beck, H., Companion to Ancient Greek Government, John Wiley & Sons, 2013, p.107. A case can be made that discriminatory lines came to be drawn more sharply under Athenian democracy than before or elsewhere, in particular in relation to women and slaves, as well as in the line between citizens and non-citizens. By so strongly validating one role, that of the male citizen, it has been argued that democracy compromised the status of those who did not share it. *Originally, a male would be a citizen if his father was a citizen, Under Pericles, in 450 BC, restrictions were tightened so that a citizen had to be born to an Athenian father and an Athenian mother. So Metroxenoi, those with foreign mothers, were now to be excluded. These mixed marriages were also heavily penalized by the time of Demosthenes. Many Athenians prominent earlier in the century would have lost citizenship had this law applied to them: Cleisthenes, the founder of democracy, had a non-Athenian mother, and the mothers of Cimon and Themistocles were not Greek at all, but Thracian. Hansen, MH., The Athenian Democracy in the Age of Demosthenes: Structure, Principles, and Ideology, University of Oklahoma Press, 1991, p.53. *Likewise the status of women seems lower in Athens than in many Greek cities. In Sparta, women competed in public exercise ‚Äì so in Aristophanes's Lysistrata the Athenian women admire the tanned, muscular bodies of their Spartan counterparts ‚Äì and women could own property in their own right, as they could not at Athens. Misogyny was by no means an Athenian invention, but it has been claimed that Athens had worse misogyny than other states at the time.Just, R., Women in Athenian Law and Life, Routledge, 2008, p. 15. *Slavery was more widespread at Athens than in other Greek cities. Indeed, the extensive use of imported non- Greeks (\\"barbarians\\") as chattel slaves seems to have been an Athenian development. This triggers the paradoxical question: Was democracy \\"based on\\" slavery? It does seem clear that possession of slaves allowed even poorer Athenians ‚Äî owning a few slaves was by no means equated with wealth ‚Äî to devote more of their time to political life.Rodriguez, JP., The Historical Encyclopedia of World Slavery, Volume 7, ABC-CLIO, 1997, pp. 312‚Äì314. But whether democracy depended on this extra time is impossible to say. The breadth of slave ownership also meant that the leisure of the rich (the small minority who were actually free of the need to work) rested less than it would have on the exploitation of their less well-off fellow citizens. Working for wages was clearly regarded as subjection to the will of another, but at least debt servitude had been abolished at Athens (under the reforms of Solon at the start of the 6th century BC). Allowing a new kind of equality among citizens opened the way to democracy, which in turn called for a new means, chattel slavery, to at least partially equalise the availability of leisure between rich and poor. In the absence of reliable statistics, all these connections remain speculative. However, as Cornelius Castoriadis pointed out, other societies also kept slaves but did not develop democracy. Even with respect to slavery, it is speculated that Athenian fathers had originally been able to register offspring conceived with slave women for citizenship. Since the 19th century, the Athenian version of democracy has been seen by one group as a goal yet to be achieved by modern societies. They want representative democracy to be added to or even replaced by direct democracy in the Athenian way, perhaps by utilizing electronic democracy. Another group, on the other hand, considers that, since many Athenians were not allowed to participate in its government, Athenian democracy was not a democracy at all. \\"[C]omparisons with Athens will continue to be made as long as societies keep striving to realize democracy under modern conditions and their successes and failures are discussed.\\"Grafton, A., Most, GA. and Settis, S., The Classical Tradition, Harvard University Press, 2010, p.259. Greek philosopher and activist Takis Fotopoulos has argued that ‚Äúthe final failure, of Athenian democracy was not due, as it is usually asserted by its critics, to the innate contradictions of democracy itself but, on the contrary, to the fact that the Athenian democracy never matured to become an inclusive democracy. This cannot be adequately explained by simply referring to the immature ‚Äòobjective‚Äô conditions, the low development of productive forces and so on‚Äîimportant as may be‚Äîbecause the same objective conditions prevailed at that time in many other places all over the Mediterranean, let alone the rest of Greece, but democracy flourished only in Athens‚Äù .Fotopoulos Takis, Towards An Inclusive Democracy, Cassell/Continuum, 1997, p.194\\" Legacy Since the middle of the 20th century, most countries have claimed to be democratic, regardless of the actual composition of their governments. Yet after the demise of Athenian democracy few looked upon it as a good form of government. No legitimation of that rule was formulated to counter the negative accounts of Plato and Aristotle, who saw it as the rule of the poor, who plundered the rich. Democracy came to be viewed as a \\"collective tyranny\\". \\"Well into the 18th century democracy was consistently condemned.\\" Sometimes, mixed constitutions evolved with democratic elements, but \\"it definitely did not mean self-rule by citizens\\".Grafton, A., Most, G.A. and Settis, S., The Classical Tradition, Harvard University Press, 2010, pp. 256‚Äì259. It would be misleading to say that the tradition of Athenian democracy was an important part of the 18th- century revolutionaries' intellectual background. The classical example that inspired the American and French revolutionaries, as well as English radicals, was Rome rather than Greece, and, in the age of Cicero and Caesar, Rome was a republic but not a democracy. Thus, the Founding Fathers of the United States who met in Philadelphia in 1787 did not set up a Council of the Areopagos, but a Senate, that, eventually, met on the Capitol.Hansen, M.H., The Tradition of Ancient Greek Democracy and Its Importance for Modern Democracy, Kgl. Danske Videnskabernes Selskab, 2005, p. 10. Following Rousseau (1712‚Äì1778), \\"democracy came to be associated with popular sovereignty instead of popular participation in the exercise of power\\". Several German philosophers and poets took delight in what they saw as the fullness of life in ancient Athens, and not long afterwards \\"English liberals put forward a new argument in favor of the Athenians\\". In opposition, thinkers such as Samuel Johnson were worried about the ignorance of democratic decision-making bodies, but \\"Macaulay and John Stuart Mill and George Grote saw the great strength of the Athenian democracy in the high level of cultivation that citizens enjoyed, and called for improvements in the educational system of Britain that would make possible a shared civic consciousness parallel to that achieved by the ancient Athenians\\".Roberts, J., in Euben, J.P., et al., Athenian Political Thought and the Reconstruction of American Democracy', Cornell University Press, 1994, p. 96. George Grote claimed in his History of Greece (1846‚Äì1856) that \\"Athenian democracy was neither the tyranny of the poor, nor the rule of the mob\\". He argued that only by giving every citizen the vote would people ensure that the state would be run in the general interest. Later, and until the end of World War Il, democracy became dissociated from its ancient frame of reference. After that, it was not just one of the many possible ways in which political rule could be organised. Instead, it became the only possible political system in an egalitarian society.

He was elected Superior General by the Society's 36th General Congregation on 14 October 2016, succeeding Adolfo Nicol√°s. As a Venezuelan, he is the first person born in Latin America to lead the Jesuits. Early life and education Arturo Marcelino Sosa Abascal was born in Caracas, Venezuela, on 12 November 1948, the son of Arturo Sosa, Sr. a Christian Socialist finance minister. He entered the Society of Jesus in 1966 and was ordained to the priesthood in 1977. He earned a licentiate in philosophy from the Universidad Cat√≥lica Andr√©s Bello in 1972, and a doctorate in political science from the Universidad Central de Venezuela in 1990. Priestly ministry Sosa has held a number of positions in various universities. He was a professor and member of the Council of the foundation for the Andr√©s Bello Catholic University, and rector of the Catholic University of Tachira, both Jesuit universities. He was also the Chair of Contemporary Political Theory and the Department of Social Change at the Faculty of Social Sciences in Venezuela. He published a number of works, mainly about the history and politics of Venezuela. He was also coordinator of the social apostolate and director of Centro Gumilla in Venezuela, a centre of research and social action for the Jesuits in Venezuela, as well as editor-in- chief of Revista SIC magazine for Catholic social ethics and politics from 1976 to 1996. In 2004, he was professor of Venezuelan political thinking at the Catholic University of Tachira and was invited to Georgetown University Center for Latin American Studies as a visiting professor to give a lecture. Between 1996 and 2004, Sosa was Provincial Superior of the Jesuits in Venezuela. During the 35th General Congregation in 2008, he was appointed Counselor General by then-Superior General Adolfo Nicol√°s. In 2014, he joined the General Curia of the Society of Jesus in Rome as Delegate for Interprovincial Roman Houses of the Society of Jesus in Rome, which include institutions such as the Pontifical Gregorian University, the Pontifical Biblical Institute, the Pontifical Oriental Institute, the Vatican Observatory, and La Civilt√† Cattolica. In Venezuela, he was strongly committed to left-wing politics, and was critical of the country's representative democracy in the 1990s. He supported the two coups d'√©tat of Hugo Chavez, though he later distanced himself from Chavez following human rights violations. Sosa speaks Spanish, Italian and English, and understands French. Superior General of the Society of Jesus On 14 October 2016, during the thirty-sixth General Congregation of the Society of Jesus, the assembly elected Sosa as the Order's thirty-first Superior General to succeed Adolfo Nicol√°s. He became the first Latin American to head the Jesuits. In his first address as Superior General, he said that Jesuits should look for \\"alternatives to overcome poverty, inequality and oppression\\" and also to collaborate with others \\"inside and outside the Church\\". In 2017, in a visit to the Jesuit mission in Cambodia, Sosa met with a group of Buddhist monks in the Buddhist-majority country. In 2018, commenting on the Fifteenth Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops, Sosa disagreed with the synod's description of secularization as \\"a dark phase that is in the process of being overcome\\", instead calling secularization a \\"sign of the times\\" for the Catholic Church. In February 2019, after guiding Jesuits and their lay collaborators through two years of discernment, Sosa announced four priorities that would guide the Society's decisions for the next decade. These were: teaching discernment through use of the Spiritual Exercises, walking with the poor in their quest for dignity and justice, accompany young people in the creation of a hope-filled future, and collaborating in the care of our Common Home. Pope Francis declared these priorities to be very much in line with those of his pontificate.  Criticism  The Catholic Herald criticised Sosa for being one of over 1,000 signatories of a 1989 letter welcoming Cuban President Fidel Castro to Venezuela in 1989, Castro having repressed the Catholic Church in Cuba during his time in power. George Neumayr of the conservative American Spectator described Sosa as a \\"Marxist\\", \\"a Venezuelan communist, and modernist\\". In February 2017, in response to Cardinal M√ºller's argument that permitting the reception of Communion by the remarried contradicts Jesus's words in the Bible that marriage is indissoluble and M√ºller's insistence that those words are unchangeable, Sosa argued for a \\"reflection on what Jesus really said\\", and described the Gospel as \\"relative\\", being \\"written by human beings\\" and \\"accepted by [...] human beings\\". Sosa also argued that the doctrine of the Church is in \\"continuous development\\", and \\"never in white and black\\". Sosa's remarks drew criticism in the Italian media. The English priest and consulting editor of The Catholic Herald Alexander Lucie-Smith disagreed with Sosa, arguing that the Church's teaching on the indissolubility of marriage has been historically consistent, and that there was no precedent set in the Bible to interpret these words otherwise. Theologian Chad Pecknold criticised Sosa's views as \\"reflect[ing] a profound skepticism about Holy Scripture\\", countering that although a variety of interpretations are allowed, they must \\"fit with the established doctrine of the Church and do not contradict the deposit of the Faith\\". Contradicting Sosa's own claim that his views were \\"not relativism\\", Pecknold characterised Sosa's remarks as \\"historicist relativizing\\". Catholic author Vittorio Messori accused Sosa of \\"'liquefying' the Gospel itself\\" by suggesting that the Gospel should be adapted according to the times on the basis that Jesus‚Äôs words were not recorded verbatim or \\"on tape\\". In June 2017, in an interview with El Mundo, Sosa said, \\"We have formed symbolic figures such as the devil to express evil. Social conditioning can also represent this figure, since there are people who act [in an evil way] because they are in an environment where it is difficult to act to the contrary\\". This was criticised as contradicting the Catechism of the Catholic Church which teaches that the Devil is a real creature. A spokesman for Sosa later argued that Sosa was not denying church teaching, saying, \\"to say the devil symbolizes evil is not to deny the existence of the devil.\\" On 21 August 2019, Sosa declared in an interview that the Devil \\"exists as the personification of evil in different structures, but not in persons, because [he] is not a person, [he] is a way of acting evil. He is not a person like a human person. It is a way of evil to be present in human life. [...] Good and evil are in a permanent war in the human conscience and we have ways to point them out. We recognize God as good, fully good. Symbols are part of reality, and the devil exists as a symbolic reality, not as a personal reality.\\" Catholic World Report criticized these declarations, saying they were contrary to the catechism, and reminded of the controversy of the June 2017 statement of Sosa concerning the Devil. In October 2018, in an interview with EWTN, Sosa argued that \\"the pope is not the chief of the Church, he's the Bishop of Rome\\". This was opposed by Pecknold, who argued that it would be wrong to believe that Pope was \\"merely 'first among equals' \\", and insisted that the pope has \\"supreme authority\\" over all bishops and the faithful.

Early life and education Julie Dorrington was born in Northampton but after World War II her family moved to Muswell Hill in North London. Her father was an engineer for the BBC at Alexandra Palace. Her mother taught dressmaking and later founded the New Embroidery Group. An only child, she attended Hornsey High Grammar School followed by a photography course at Regent Street Polytechnic. Dorrington then qualified as a medical photographer through the Institute of Incorporated Photographers (now the British Institute of Professional Photography), and completed her apprenticeship at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London. Career After a stint in commercial photography, Dorrington soon changed fields, and started her traineeship at St Bartholomew's Hospital where she met Norman K Harrison, Peter Cull and David Tredinnic, key players in the establishment of medical illustration as a profession. Dorrington had a long career at St Bartholomew's and held the role of Deputy Director of the Department of Medical Illustration. This led her to teaching clinical photography at the London School of Medical Photography for 16 years. It was also her involvement as an associate founding member of the Institute of Medical Illustrators (IMI), that demonstrates her professional impact. Dorrington had many administrative and leadership roles within the organisation, which she was a member of for 42 years. She was secretary/registrar of the institute for 40 years. After 30 years at St. Bartholomew's, Dorrington made a move to Graves Medical Audiovisual in Chelmsford, where she managed the National Medical Slidebank collection of 12,000 clinical images. Just 3 years later, the collection was moved to Wellcome Trust's Medical Photographic Library (now known as Wellcome Images). Here, Dorrington established the medical contemporary collection. She spent 12 years at the Wellcome Trust, until her retirement in 2005. Honours and awards For her outstanding contribution to IMI, Dorrington was the first recipient of the Norman K Harrison Gold Medal in 1972. In 1985 Dorrington was awarded Honorary Fellowship to the IMI.

Guided by a vision of a world, where all women and men have equal and full social, economic and political rights.  History  The Womanity Foundation was established in 2005 by Yann Borgstedt, a Swiss businessman. Founded on the premise that a partnership between businesses, social entrepreneurs, and artists could accelerate socio- economic progress and improve the equal participation of women, Borgstedt created the organization, which was originally called The Smiling Children Foundation. The organization's first programs focused on child labor in Morocco to assist domestic servants as young as six to return to their families and have access to education. In 2007, after the Taliban's ban on female education ended, work started in Afghanistan at the Al-Fatah school for girls in Kabul to remove barriers for girls to access education and improve their prospects for the labor market. In 2009, the organization created its WomenChangeMakers Fellowship program to assist entrepreneurs with programs that benefit women. Raising funds through gala events, where items designed specifically for Womanity are auctioned, the foundation has been able to expand their reach internationally, including operating programs in Afghanistan, Brazil, India, Israel, Mexico, Morocco, and Palestine. In 2011 and 2012 Womanity provided funding to Entrepreneurs du Monde to aid with the reconstruction of Haiti with a program supporting women entrepreneurship with paid jobs, a microcredit scheme, training, and infrastructure.  Themes  The Womanity Foundation focuses its work across four priority areas. = Safety and wellbeing = To address the issues of physical and sexual violence against women, the Womanity Award for the Prevention of Violence Against Women was launched in 2014, and is given biennially to two organizations which utilize innovative and effective solutions to prevent gender-based violence. The award provides US $300,000. 2014 Womanity Award winners were Promundo, an NGO based in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for Program H, which uses group activities and community campaigns to educate young men about respectful and fair behaviour towards women; and Abaad, a non-profit, non-religious, non- politically affiliated organization based in Lebanon dedicated to the advancement, participation and empowerment of women in Lebanon and in the Middle East and North Africa, and through this aim to increase social and economic development. 2016 Womanity Award winners were Take Back the Tech! (), a campaign in Mexico, led by the Association for Progressive Communications (South Africa); and the television program \\"Luchadoras\\" (the female Wrestlers) broadcast by the collective media organization La Sand√≠a Digital. The campaign addresses the widespread problem of online violence against women, enables women to proactively respond to online abuse, claim virtual space and creatively influence policies and practices. The ultimate goal is to build an internet free of violence. In 2017, Womanity partnered with J Walter Thompson to run an advertising campaign in Brazil to challenge the 1 in 3 people who believe that the clothing a woman wears causes rape rather than rapists. = Education and vocational training = Although many girls are now enrolling in Afghan schools following the fall of the Taliban regime, schools in the region have few resources and infrastructure is inadequate. In 2007, Womanity began its School in a Box program in the Al-Fatah school, Kabul. Organizational goals were to improve the infrastructure, resources and teaching, while also addressing specific cultural barriers to girls attending school, such as early marriage, and the impact of a lack of qualified female teaching staff as role models. In 2012, Safeena Husain was a Womanity WomenChangeMakers Fellow. Husain is the founder and Chief Executive of Educate Girls, a non-profit organization devoted to tackling gender inequality in India's education system and to creating a sustainable model for the education of girls. The project has so far helped 80,000 girls enrol into school. Womanity launched Girls Can Code in Kabul in April 2016 at two of the largest schools in the city. In 2017 Womanity partnered with Goodwall to launch the Goodwall Womanity Scholarship for female students in the Middle East and Africa to have the opportunity for one year of full-tuition at the Swiss International Scientific School of Dubai; the runner up gains $5,000 tuition towards a university of their choice; and the top twelve students gain a new laptop or tablet. = Giving women a voice = In 2009, in partnership with the Radio Nisaa Broadcasting Company, Womanity established Radio Nisaa FM in Palestine territories. The station, managed by women, aims to represent women's concerns and issues in a culture where the media is heavily male-dominated. Content is not feminist oriented, but includes news, discussion, music, and investigative reports, created by women. Within five years of its launch, Radio Nisaa had become the fifth largest radio station in terms audience share in the Middle East. Based on the success, new strategy was developed to expand its output across the Arab world by partnering with 10 more media outlets by 2018. Womanity created the Nisaa Network, to coordinate efforts for changing the regional perception of women with media outlets and other women's organizations in Arabic and English languages. In 2013, Womanity in partnership with Lapis Communication created the Arabic radio drama Be 100 Ragl (Worth 100 Men, or ) about a young female radio journalist who challenges prejudice. It was aired during the month of Ramadan in the Middle East and North Africa. The lead role was played by Mona Zaki and the theme tune to the first series was performed by Nancy Ajram. The second series of Be 100 Ragl was an animation, aired in 2016, followed by panel discussions at the Dutch Institute in Zamalek. Themes such as access to education, domestic violence, sexual harassment, and other topics were portrayed, using humor and positive story lines, to generate discussion on sensitive topics that affect women in the region.  Awards  The Womanity Foundation rose to the 187th position of the Top 500 NGOs‚Äô in 2016 world-wide ranking by NGO Advisor, a Geneva-based independent media. The ranking identifies social development and humanitarian non-governmental non-profit organisations (NGOs), which excel in innovation, impact and sustainability.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. Description and history Bridge 12 is located in a rural area of northern Enosburg, northeast of the village of Enosburgh Falls. It carries Boston Post Road (Town Highway 2) across the Missisquoi River, just south of its junction with Vermont Route 105, a major regional east-west road. The bridge is long, and rests on concrete abutments. It has an overall width of , and a roadway width of . Each truss has eight triangular panels, the central ones stiffened by counter-diagonal struts, and reaching a maximum depth of . The trusses are joined together by a network of sway bracing. The bridge deck is concrete resting on a network of steel stringers and floor beams. with The bridge was built in 1929 to a state-approved design by L.H. Shoemaker, and the truss elements were fabricated by the Lackawanna Steel Construction Company of Buffalo, New York. The crossing site probably had a number of timber-frame bridges, the earliest definitively dated to the 1870s. The bridge was built in the wake of floods that washed away more than 1,200 bridges in Vermont, and accelerated the standardization of bridge construction in the state. This is one of a small number of surviving truss bridges on the Missisquoi River.

It formally opened as Ruskington Secondary Modern School in 1957, although teaching had begun the previous year. It federated with St George's College of Technology in nearby Sleaford in 2007, and then closed at the end of 2009 to allow the schools to merge into St George's Academy. The buildings and grounds were significantly redeveloped in 2012‚Äì15 to serve as a satellite school for the Academy. History The Education Act 1944 made secondary education available to all children up to the age of 15; a 'tripartite system' of secondary schools was established to provide curricula based on aptitude and ability: grammar schools for \\"academic\\" pupils, secondary moderns for practical studies, and technical schools for science and engineering. Pupils were allocated to them depending on their score in the eleven-plus examination. In 1947, Kesteven County Council outlined its 15-year plan for secondary education, which included the construction of a new secondary modern school at Ruskington. The buildings were completed in the 1950s and teaching commenced at Ruskington Secondary Modern School in 1956; the buildings were officially opened by Sir John Wolfenden, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Reading, the following year. Built on a site at a cost of ¬£100,658, the new school buildings consisted of a three-storeys of classrooms and a gymnasium, assembly/dining hall, library and greenhouse. The buildings were built around a prefabricated steel frame and modular concrete blocks clad in brick. Much of the site was devoted to playing fields, which were supplemented by eight grass tennis courts and playground. The first headmaster was George Morris Butler (died 2004), who served until 1976.\\"George Morris Butler\\", Lincolnshire Echo, 5 June 2004. Retrieved 15 October 2016. Archived at the Internet Archive on 15 October 2016. In 1993, Coteland's was threatened with closure due to declining rolls, as parents began sending children to other schools; it was operating at half capacity, with 170 pupils on roll. David Veal took over as head-teacher in 1994 and later recalled that there was \\"a stigma attached to the school\\", which he suggested contributed to pupils lacking self-esteem and becoming demotivated, a matter compounded by the eleven-plus exam which primary school leavers sat. Budget restrictions had also reduced the number of staff. According to The Independent, Ruskington was then a village of about 6,000 people, \\"many working in local food-processing factories, in agriculture or in nearby RAF bases on lowish incomes\\", and \\"very few professional families\\" sent children to Coteland's.Berliner, Wendy (25 November 2001), \\"David Veal, secondary head teacher ‚Äì how one school got out of the relegation zone... with a little inspiration from Becks\\", The Independent on Sunday, p. 10 Many of the most academic pupils from local primary schools were instead choosing to attend the grammar schools in Sleaford after passing the eleven-plus exam; in 1994, there were only three children in the school who were classed as 'above-average' in terms of academic ability. By 1998, Coteland's was ranked the second-worst school in Britain when 2% of pupils attained five GCSEs at grades A*‚ÄìC. But by 2001, this had increased to 38%, making it one of the most improved school's in the country. Veal said this was largely due to changing the \\"ethos ... so parents can be confident it is somewhere pupils can learn.\\"Cassidy, Sarah (22 November 2001), \\"The best worst-performing school ... 'change of ethos' turns round second-worst school in Britain\\", The Independent, p. 12 In 2002, Ofsted recommended that Lincolnshire County Council review schools with under 600 pupils. Two years later, the Council's education officers suggested that some of these schools merge, close or federate to make them more economical. St George's College of Technology in the nearby market town of Sleaford merged with two small village schools‚ÄîLafford High School and Aveland High School‚Äîin 2005 and 2006 respectively. A plan to merge them into an Academy was announced the following year; Coteland's was allowed to opt-in. When David Veal retired as headteacher of Coteland's in 2007, the school joined the federation; with that, Paul Watson became executive head of all four schools. Following a heated meeting with parents, Watson resigned as head of Lafford in 2008, and the school closed two years later. One writer for The Times Educational Supplement pointed out the GCSE results for the smaller schools would be effectively \\"cancelled out\\" by St George's results if they merged, regardless of whether they improve.Stewart, William (21 November 2008). \\"Merger flattens results\\".

The reservoir was initially approved under the Keighley Waterworks and Improvement Act of 1869 but work did not begin on its construction until 1911 and even then was delayed because of the First World War. The reservoir was officially opened in August 1925 in front of a crowd of over 8,000 people. Its final tally on cost was ¬£500,000. The reservoir lies in the Sladen Valley and was often referred to as Sladen Valley Reservoir. The reservoir, alongside other nearby man-made bodies of water, was proposed to afford a better water supply to the town of Keighley and its environs. Lower Laithe Reservoir. The octagonal valve tower has 5 storeys of drawing mechanisms beneath it. This is looking northwards towards Stanbury across the dam head. The reservoir dams Sladen Beck watercourse and takes water directly from the surrounding moorland including the stream that flows over the Bronte Waterfall. The catchment area is and the Sladen Valley and Beck are part of the larger catchment of the River Worth and ultimately the River Aire. The reservoir has an embankment as the dam head which is straight and extends to a length of , a height of and which also supports a road between Oxenhope and Stanbury village. The road (since known as Waterhead Lane) used to cut across Sladen valley taking a north west route from Intake Farm and going through the small hamlet of Smith Bank. The hamlet and its mill (which featured in Halliwell Sutcliffe's novel A Man of the Moors) were flooded when the reservoir was completed with the road being diverted northwards onto the dam head. The dam head is concrete with a clay puddle core. There is a spillway at the northern end which drops down to the adjoining waterworks facility. Stone for the reservoir was sourced from the nearby Dimples Quarry (now abandoned and in the Penistone Hill Country Park) which was south east of the reservoir. A narrow gauge railway was used to transfer the quarried product to the dam head which was operated by a rope worked incline. Clay for the central core was worked from a quarry west of Stanbury and necessitated laying a steam worked railway to bring the clay to the dam head. The spillway and embankment were modernized and improved as part of a ¬£60 million programme of investment by Yorkshire Water. Lower Laithe specifically was found to not have been up to standards as laid down by an act of parliament in 1978. The water classification is listed as moderate in terms of ecology and good in terms of chemical quality as of 2015. Whilst the surrounding moorland is noted for its bird life, few birds live on the reservoir itself although some like the shelduck are frequent visitors. Sladen Beck joins the River Worth further east near to the hamlet of Lumb Foot. The grassed east facing slope of the dam head was used as a backdrop for a banner promoting the Tour de Yorkshire. The banner was unveiled in January 2014 as part of a wider 'Yorkshire Festival' by the owners of the reservoir and one of the sponsors of the festival, Yorkshire Water.

Later life  The previous state forester's initiative was continued in the 1940s by new state forester Hvass. He planted small clusters of large, exotic trees, and over the next 30 years Hvass planted the area with over 100 different trees and shrubs from all over the northern hemisphere. Hvass had been away from the admonitions of his superiors for years, and by the inauguration in 1970, the entire project was completed without management's knowledge. During World War II Hvass saved many people, and after 1945 he devoted himself to the restoration of Scouting in several countries. He spread the idea of Jamborette and was awarded the Bronze Wolf, the only distinction of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, awarded by the World Scout Committee for exceptional services to world Scouting, in 1957.

Dubbed \\"Queen of American Agriculture\\" by the citizens of Mississippi in the 1890s, Meredith was also a pioneer in agricultural education. Between 1897 and 1903 she established the home economics programs at the University of Minnesota and served as the program's first professor. From 1921 to 1936 she served as the first woman appointed a Purdue University trustee. Meredith chose an unusual vocation for women of her time, successfully managing the day-to-day operations of her family's Indiana farm from 1882 until 1915. In addition to her agricultural-related work, Meredith was appointed to the Women's Board of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, serving as vice chair of the Women's Board and chair of its awards committee. She was also elected president of the Indiana Union of Literary Clubs, a founder of the Indiana Federation of Women's Clubs, and the first president of the Indiana Home Economics Association, founded in 1913. Early life and education Virginia Claypool, the oldest of Hannah Ann (Petty) and Austin Bingley Claypool's eight children, was born on November 5, 1848, and grew up on Maplewood Farm near Connersville, Fayette County, Indiana. Newton Claypool, her paternal grandfather, was an early Indiana pioneer from Virginia who brought his wife from Ohio to settle in the wilderness. Austin Claypool, her father, became a prosperous farmer who was also active in politics and an early trustee of Purdue University. At the age of fifteen Virginia enrolled at enrolled at Glendale Female College in Glendale, Ohio, graduating with honors in 1866 and earning a Bachelor of Arts degree.Bartholomew, p. 50. Marriage and family Virginia Claypool married Henry Clay Meredith, the sole surviving son of American Civil War General Solomon Meredith and his wife, Anna Meredith, on April 28, 1870. During the war Henry Meredith served as a second lieutenant and aide-de-camp on his father's staff. Henry's two brothers, Samuel and David, died from battlefield injuries. Following their marriage the young couple resided at General Meredith's Oakland Farm, settling into the family's Federal-style home along the National Road near Cambridge City, Indiana. When Anna Meredith died about eighteen months after Virginia and Henry Meredith's marriage, twenty-three-year-old Virginia took charge of running the household. She also learned about raising livestock and running a farming operation from her father-in-law and husband. Henry Meredith managed the farm following the death of his father in 1875 and became active in politics, serving as president of the Indiana Board of Agriculture and was elected in 1881 to the Indiana General Assembly. While her husband served in the state legislature, Virginia Meredith oversaw the management of the family farm and began to show and sell livestock. When she was widowed at the age of thirty-three, after her thirty-eight-year-old husband died from pneumonia on July 5, 1882, Virginia Meredith became sole owner of the family farm and assumed management of its operation.Klink, pp. 8‚Äì9. Four years after the death of her husband, Meredith took on the additional responsibilities of single motherhood. After the death of Hattie Beach Matthews, a close friend, Meredith adopted her friend's two young children, a daughter, Mary L. Matthews, who became the first Dean of the School of Home Economics at Purdue University, and a son, Meredith Matthews, who attended Purdue University, worked as an engineer, and later moved to California.Klink, p. 13. Career Meredith became a nationally known woman farmer. For more than three decades she managed her Indiana farms and raised two adopted children. In the 1880s Meredith began speaking at Farmers' Institutes, forerunner to the Cooperative Extension Service, addressing audiences on various agricultural subjects. Her speeches on the topic of livestock management were a novelty for that time, when women rarely delivered public addresses and even fewer managed their own farms. The experience launched her career as a public speaker and writer. Meredith was a writer and editor for several years for the Breeders' Gazette, a livestock journal,Bartholomew, pp. 54‚Äì55. and is considered the first woman to be hired by Purdue University's Agricultural Extension Department.Klink, p. 10. Beginning in 1882 Meredith assumed management responsibilities of Oakland Farm, which she inherited after the death of her husband. The family farm near Cambridge City, Indiana, was known for its find herds of Shorthorn cattle and Southdown and Shropshire sheep.. In addition to managing the farm she became a livestock breeder, an unlikely vocational choice for a woman at that time, and won several prizes for her entries at livestock competitions. From 1890 to 1894 Meredith was also active on the Women's Board (also known as the Board of Lady Managers) of the World's Columbian Exposition, which took place in Chicago, Illinois, in 1893. Meredith served as the Board's vice chair and chair of its awards committee.Klink, p. 11.. She authored \\"The Work of the Board of Lady Managers\\" describing their work. In 1895 Meredith was invited to speak at a farmers' institute at Vicksburg, Mississippi, where she delivered a speech titled \\"Profitable Sheep Husbandry\\" during a time in the Deep South when it was considered inappropriate for women to speak in public. On the final evening of the conference Meredith was surprised with a gold medal that proclaimed her \\"the Queen of American Agriculture.\\"Klink, p. 12. In 1896 Meredith moved to Minnesota, where she was the first preceptress at the University of Minnesota's School of Agriculture. Meredith was responsible for forming the university's home economics program and also served as the program's first professor. Between 1897 and 1903 Meredith served for six years as head of the home economic department at Minnesota, in addition to spending time at her Indiana farm when school was not in session. In May 1900 she sold Oakland Farm and purchased a farm south of Cambridge City. Meredith named the property Narborough Farm. Meredith returned to Indiana on a permanent basis following a disagreement with Frederich D. Ticker, the School of Agriculture's principal, that later led the University of Minnesota's board to request both of their resignations. Meredith resigned in 1903.Klink, p. 13. After returning to Indiana, Meredith resumed speaking at farmers' institutes while lobbying for support to establish a home economics program at Purdue University. Her involvement with Purdue had begun in 1899, when she first began speaking for the Farmer's Institute. Meredith's lectures across Indiana offered \\"to educate farmers on the latest science and technology in agriculture.\\" She gave up day- to-day management of her Cambridge City farm in 1915 due to her advancing age and moved to West Lafayette, Indiana, in 1916 to live with her adopted daughter, Mary Matthews. After the move Meredith continued speaking and wrote articles for agricultural journals. In 1921 she became the first woman appointed to Purdue's board of trustees and served in that capacity until her death in 1936. In addition to her agricultural work Meredith was an active clubwoman. She was president of the Helen Hunt Club, a Cambridge City literary group, and the Cambridge City chapter of the Equal Franchise League. She was also president of the Indiana Union of Literary Clubs and a founder of the Indiana Federation of Women's Clubs. Meredith was named an honorary president of the Federation in 1918 when the two organizations merged. In addition, Meredith was the first president of the Indiana Home Economics Association, founded in 1913. Death and legacy Meredith died at her home in West Lafayette, Indiana, on December 10, 1936, at the age of eighty- eight.Bartholomew, p. 56.\\"'Queen Agriculture' Dies\\" Lincoln Evening Journal (December 11, 1936): 9. via Newspapers.com Purdue University's Board of Trustees paid tribute to her service at the time of her death, calling her \\"a woman of rare qualities\\" with \\"wide interests\\" who \\"created her own enduring memorial\\" through her public service and agricultural work.Bartholomew, p. 57. A collection of Meredith's papers are housed at the Purdue University Libraries, Archives and Special Collections in West Lafayette, Indiana. Dubbed \\"Queen of American Agriculture\\" in the 1890s, Meredith was a successful stock- raiser who also oversaw the day-to-day operation of her Indiana farm, an unusual occupation for an American woman in the late-nineteenth century. She was also a pioneer in agricultural education. Meredith established the University of Minnesota's home economics program and served as the program's first professor. Her public lectures and lobbying efforts also helped to pave the way toward the establishment in 1905 of a home economics department at Purdue University, predecessor to its present-day College of Consumer and Family Sciences. Meredith became the first woman appointed to the Board of Trustees at Purdue, serving from 1921 to 1936. She believed that women had the right to work outside the home, as well as recognizing the important role that women had in caring for a home and family. Meredith, an active clubwoman, was involved with several civic organizations, most notably on the Women's Board of the World's Columbian Exposition from 1890 to 1894, as the first president of the Indiana Home Economics Association in 1913, and as an organizer of the Indiana Federation of Women's Clubs.

The first Scout donation took place on May 21, 1932. During the first year there were 53 blood donors in Denmark, who gave 33 units of blood.

History and classification P. aberrans is known from a single ant found in Russia. The specimen was described from a compression fossil preserved in diatomite deposits of the Bol‚Äôshaya Svetlovodnaya site. The site is exposed on the bank of Barachek Creek upstream from the creek's confluence with the Bol‚Äôshaya Svetlovodnaya River in the Pozharsky District, on the Pacific Coast of Russia. The fossil-bearing rocks preserve possibly Priabonian plants and animals which lived in and around a small lake near a volcano. The site has been attributed to either the Maksimovka or Salibez Formations and compared to the Bembridge Marls and Florissant Formation, both of which are Priabonian in age. At the time of description, the holotype adult specimen, number PIN 3429/104 was preserved in the A. A. Borissiak Paleontological Institute collections, part of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The fossil was first described by the trio of paleomyrmecologists Gennady Dlussky, Alexandr Rasnitsyn and Ksenia Perfilieva. In the type description, Dlussky, Rasnitsyn and Perfilieva named the species P. aberrans, with the specific epithet derived the Latin aberrans meaning \\"aberrant\\" or \\"to deviate\\". P. aberrans is one of two Pachycondyla species that were described by Dlussky, Rasnitsyn and Perfilieva from Bol‚Äôshaya Svetlovodnaya, the other species P. oligocenica being described from a male. Description The incomplete adult of P. aberrans is missing its head and a portion of the gaster, making determination of its sex impossible, with male or a queen as possibilities. The preserved portions of the ant indicate a body length of , with a tall petiole node between the thorax and the gaster. The fore-wing is also incomplete, with an estimated length of approximately .

The utility of each agent, under this mechanism, is the probability that one of his Good outcomes is selected. The utilitarian mechanism averages over outcomes with largest ‚Äúapproval‚Äù. It is Pareto efficient, strategyproof, anonymous and neutral. It is impossible to attain these properties in addition to proportionality - giving each agent a utility of at least 1/n; or at least the fraction of good to feasible outcomes. conjecture that no ex ante efficient and strategyproof mechanism guarantees a strictly positive utility to all agents, and prove a weaker statement. = With money = Suppose all agents have DP cardinal utility, where each agent is characterized by a single number - u_{high} (so that u_{low}=0). identify a new condition, generation monotonicity, that is necessary and sufficient for implementation by a truthful mechanisms in any dichotomous domain (see Monotonicity (mechanism design)). If such a domain satisfies a richness condition, then a weaker version of generation monotonicity, 2-generation monotonicity (equivalent to 3-cycle monotonicity), is necessary and sufficient for implementation. This result can be used to derive the optimal mechanism in a one-sided matching problem with agents who have dichotomous types.

He was believed to be a highly enlightened person who acquired a distinct group of followers during his lifetime. At a very young age, he left his family to seek enlightenment and became a disciple of Maha Harnam Singh Ji, Baba Nand Singh Ji left his bodily form at Nanaksar in Punjab which is now recognized as the central dera although his devotees have established Gurudwaras under the name of Nanaksar around the world.  Early Life  As a young boy, he was trained in the family's craft and then moved to Lahiri Khana, in the Bathinda district of Punjab, to join a seminary run by Sant Vadhava Singh from whom he learned to read Sikh Scripture, the Guru Granth Sahib. Under the influence of a Sikh mystic, Baba Harnam Singh of Bhucho Kalari, he was drawn to meditation and practiced the discipline for twelve years at various places such as Hazur Sahib (Nanded), Lahiri Khana, Harappa, and Birki. Rewarded with insight, he took to preaching Guru Nanak's word and travelled extensively across the country. He established preaching centers called That's at Nanaksar Kalerari, Jharig Maghiana, Birki, Harappa, Montgomery, Jhorarari, and in a village, Pauda, near Dehradun. In his favorite sermons, he stressed the value of Kirtan,(singing of the holy hymns) and Simran, (repetition of the Divine Name). Sant Nand Singh died at the village of Kalerari on 29 August 1943 (15 Badron Sampat 2000) and his remains were consigned to the River Sutlej at Sidhvari Pattan. He is best remembered today for Nanaksar Kalerari shrine which was his principal centre.  Details  He left his village at the age of 20 and stayed at Amritsar and Rookee before residing at Hazoor Sahib where he undertook to perform the duty of bringing two pitchers, full of water from the river Godavari at 12:15am for the purpose of ablution of the Sacred Gurdwara. Baba Ji saw Sri Guru Har Krishan Sahib, the Eighth Guru, and Sri Guru Gobind Singh, the Tenth Guru and Sri Guru Nanak Dev ji, the First Guru many times. He heard their divine instructions and was directed to get full knowledge and understanding of the Gurbani of Sri Guru Granth Sahib. He left Hazoor Sahib in about 1904 A.D. and adopted Sant Wadhawa Singh of village Lehra Gaga as his teacher. Sant Wadhawa Singh was wonder stuck to observe the supernatural powers of Baba Ji who learned completely, in a short time, all that Sant ji had to teach. Sant Wadhawa Singh used to call Baba ji ‚ÄúRikhi Ji‚Äù. Baba Ji was eager to find some gifted soul who fulfilled the definition of Brahmgiani and was told of Baba Harnam Singli ji of Bhucho village in Patiala State.  Meeting with Baba Harnam Singh  On the first meeting Baba Harnam Singh directed Baba Nand Singh ji to go on repeating the First Pauri of Japji Sahib for one hundred and fifty thousand times. Baba ji promised to do so, bowed his head and returned to the village of Lehra Gaga. He remain absorbed in meditation for many months, and during this period, Baba ji took short intervals to visit distant places in West Punjab, where he would sit alone far away from habitation, and in rather deserted places. After some years, Baba Ji visited Bhucho again and met Baba Harnam Singh ji and this time Baba Harnam Singh ji showered his grace and spiritual powers on him. Baba ji began the mission of preaching the worship of One God and His Name and the Mission of Guru Nanak of Universal Brotherhood. He relieved many miserable persons from diseases, poverty and distress and induced them to worship the Guru and the Supreme Being. He sat at a deserted place, away from the village and remained in meditation for days. In the beginning, for a number of years, Baba Ji used to sit in meditation for days and days in secluded places, far away from the towns and habitation. He used to select some deserted old room, near some river or tank or in some jungle, where it was difficult for anyone to go. His unique dependence on Almighty God and Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji prompted some fortunate devotees to bring food and bare necessities for him. Baba Ji used to direct devotees to build with mud one temporary hut-like structure for himself and another for Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji. When he left one place for another, he used to get the structure demolished and burnt.  Path of deep devotion to Naam  Baba Ji DID NOT perform any miracles, but as explained in the Divine Hymns, supernatural powers automatically serve as humble servants of the Brahmgiani, who attains union with GOD during his lifetime. Once Baba Ji appeared at Hoti Mardan where famous Sant Baba Karam Singh Ji used to stay. It was summer then and most of the disciples would rest in a vast Chloe (Rivulet) downhill which was dry then. Whenever it rained in the higher hilly regions a flash flood would come thundering down the Chloe. Ignorant of this Baba ji, young and alone, selected a secluded spot in the rivulet and would pass the night there, as usual, in deep meditation. Soon on one night heavy rains in the higher regions started flooding the rivulet and on its downward journey the rushing waters had gained tremendous momentum and force. Hearing the roar from approaching waters the disciples ran out of the rivulet. Reaching safety they realised that the newcomer was still in bottom of the Chloe in threat being swept away and drowned. They shouted at Baba ji to rush out. But Baba ji was deep in meditation. Meanwhile, the flood in spate had already over taken the place.  Flood presents no danger  The depth of the water is said to have reached 6 feet. They were wonder stuck when the torrents of water encircled Baba ji but did not touch him. The surging waters around Baba ji remained at a respectable distance of a couple of feet. As Baba ji got up and faced towards the bank, the gushing waters parted giving way, rising again after Baba Ji had passed through. It was clear that it was watching all the while in eager anticipation of washing Baba ji's holy feet. The mighty rivulet in full spate parted its waters to the passing Lord's Beloved and the waters closed in after he had passed through. Mysterious was the way in which nature paid its touching homage to its Baba Nand Singh ji. In another incident in the jungles of Dehradun during the monsoon season the sky was overcast with Kalamega (dark thundering clouds). Kirtan was in progress but in the deafening sound of lightning and thunder nothing could be heard. It was time for Baba ji to speak. Mahan Baba ji just looked up into the thundering sky. No sooner had he looked up, that the thundering clouds parted in four directions and the sky become absolutely clear. The Full moon become clearly visible and its soothing beams started dancing on the jungle grass-which provided a wonderful natural scene of beauty. Suddenly a 'pin-drop' silence pervaded the whole place of congregation of thousands but through length and breadth of Nature, this phenomenon was amazing. At the end of the congregation Baba ji asked the Sangat to go to the nearby villages for the night and as soon as the last member of the Sangat was under shelter, clouds joined together and burst into a ferocious downpour. It is not possible to narrate the most extraordinary events and results that happened during the lifetime of Baba ji. However a brief list is as follows : * a) He knew the internal conditions and thoughts of those who came to pay respects to him. * b) He had seen Guru Nanak Dev Ji many times and he used to talk with him. He was always in contact with the Creator. * c) He used to take nominal quantity of food and never slept. * d) He would sometimes wipe the feet and shoes of the devotees himself. * e) Many childless couples had children and sincere devotees, who suffered from incurable diseases, were cured.  Extreme respect for Guru Granth Sahib  The unique way in which Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji is respected as the living Guru at Nanaksar Gurdwara is worthy of praise. One instance of the utmost devotion and respect shown by Baba ji is given here: In the winter season of 1938, Baba ji visited the town of Baghanwala. The Thaath could not be constructed immediately. Baba ji observed , \\"I have not come here to eat food. I have not been able to have Grace and the sight of Divine Guru. If Guru Granth Sahib ji is not brought here by tomorrow I shall go elsewhere. On this, the whole town came to the spot and worked day and night to complete The Thaath. Sri Guru Granth Sahib ji, was brought by S. Sukha Singh Manglani. After the kirtan of the morning Bani, (Asa Di Vaar) had finished Baba ji submitted to the Guru. \\"0 True King! I am highly thankful to you. Blessed are the paths, on which you have travelled. Kindly excuse me for the trouble that you have taken. I beg your pardon.\\" Baba ji then took off his long turban, keeping the small one tied on the head. He first wiped the feet of Bhai Sukha Singh ji then, spread it on the ground, and requested Bhai Sahib to walk on it while carrying the Guru Granth Sahib ji on his head. Where one turban ended, another was spread. Thus the great saint Baba Nand Singh ji used to love and respect the Ever-lasting Sri Guru Granth Sahib ji. Enlightenment He received spiritual guidance from Sant Baba MahaHarnam Singh Ji. He was influenced by the teachings of Bulleh Shah as well.

Built about 1887, it is a well-preserved example of a period neighborhood store with residences above. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. Description and history The William Fitzgerald Block stands in Burlingtons' Old North End neighborhood, at the northwest corner of North Champlain Street and Sherman Street. It faces North Champlain Street, a major north-bound thoroughfare through the neighborhood. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a flat roof and clapboarded exterior. Its Italianate features include a projecting cornice decorated with elaborate paired brackets, a simpler bracketed cornice over the first-floor storefronts, and peaked sills above the second-story windows. The front facade is six bays wide, housing a storefront in southern four bays. There are four doors, one recessed into the storefront, and two of other three providing access to the upper floors; the fourth provides access to a ground-floor apartment built out of former retail space at the north end. The block was built about 1887, by William and Mary Fitzgerald, who operated a neighborhood store and lived in the northernmost residential unit.

Antiblavers project  Llu√≠s Brines was the ideologist and creator of the website antiblavers, whose main aim was to fight in a scientific and serious way against Blaverism. Other collaborators took care of the informatic matters. At the end of 2004 a group of people around the Valencian Community was very concerned about the fact that there were many Blaverist websites, such as www.elpalleter.com, www.valenciafreedom.com or www.llenguavalencianasi.com. Moreover, these websites were very aggressive and offered a biased point of view. So they had the aim of creating a serious and scientific tool in order to fight against Blaverism. This is the way that www.antiblavers.info was born in May 2005. In the beginning the website offered only information, with a part of research materials and a gallery of images. During its first year it achieved 35,000 visits.News in Levante-EMV . After some time, in August 2006, a forum was added.News in Rac√≥ catal√† . One of the most important milestones of the website during its first years was the gathering of old and modern evidences of the flag with four red stripes in Valencian territory. This way in February 2010 there were already 2100 evidences that had been gathered.News in Rac√≥ catal√† . In the research that lead to the report about the historicity of the flag with four red stripes in Valencian territory, the creators of this website had the personal advising of the prestigious Valencian heraldist Pere Maria Orts i Bosch. Logo de la web antiblavers.org At the end of 2010 the website creators suffered an outrageous attack campaign that was made by the Blaverists, who were very upset by the task of telling the historical truth and of fighting them that this website was doing. Maybe one thing that made Blaverists very upset was the success of the campaign that was done by the website antiblavers, in collaboration with the antifeixistes website in order to avoid the presence of the GAV (Group of Valencianist Action) in the Christmas fair Expojove during the Christmas of 2010. As they acknowledged themselves, Expojove was the main attraction point for new members of the GAV.News in the www.antifeixistes.com website As a result of these immoderate attacks, in 2011 Llu√≠s Brines ceased to be the main administrator of the website, and other people began to do this task, even though he collaborated from time to time. Moreover, the project was divided into two websites: * antiblavers.org ‚Äì The main website, that has most of the information and a debate forum. * antiblavers.info ‚Äì It was the first name of the website, before the project was divided into two websites. Nowadays it is a blog, whose content is varied and dynamic.Announcement of the birth of this blog in February 2011.  Blaverist threats and attacks  The first important Blaverist attack against Llu√≠s Brines took place in December 2010, when in his old address in Valencia some graffiti appeared with his name and surname and the words \\"paederast\\" and \\"paedophile\\". These insults against him were constantly repeated in the website www.valenciafreedom.com, which is linked with the GAV. The graffiti was allegedly made by the former co-president of the Youths of the GAV (JJGAV) Aitor Alan Marquina Ba√±uls.Image of graffitis Threatening graffiti with a bull's eye against Llu√≠s Brines i Garcia that was made in Valencia on 24 November 2012. This 71 is the GAV's anagram. A bit later, in January 2011, other graffitis appeared in Simat de la Valldigna (Safor), the village of Brines' paternal family, where he was also called \\"paederast\\" and \\"paedophile\\". Several witnesses of the village identified the GAV activist from Gand√≠a Francisco Albi√±ana Barber as the author of such graffitis.Image of this graffiti Finally, in November 2012 another graffiti appeared in the address of Valencia that was used by Llu√≠s Brines as the address for court notifications. This graffiti consisted in Brines' name and surnames, a bull's eye and it was signed by the anagram 71, which is the one that the GAV uses (7 is the place of letter G inside the alphabet, and 1 is the place of letter A).Image of this graffiti The three graffitis were denounced by Llu√≠s Brines, but this kind of graffitis are seldom (or never) investigated in Spain, and these three matters were filed by the legal authorities. Furthermore, in the Blaverist and far-right website valenciafreedom there is a permanent thread, allegedly opened by the above- mentioned Francisco Albi√±ana Barber (who uses the pseudonyms of paco1983 and nandivirus in that website), where Llu√≠s Brines receives all kinds of insults and slanders.This is the thread . Francisco Albi√±ana Barber was finally condemned in 2018 to pay a fine of 600 ‚Ç¨,The first sentence was appealed by Francisco Albi√±ana Barber. But it was unsuccessful, and so this is the final condemnatory sentence, which was issued on 5 September 2018. and since then he ceased to attack Llu√≠s Brines and even to write in the Blaverist and far- right website valenciafreedom.

The story deals with the end of the end of the world, its main character being Peter Robinson, a survivor. It is similar to King's novel, The Stand, but it focuses more on Robinson's character and how he deals with it, than how the world actually ended.  Plot  The world is in a nuclear war, and most of the population has been wiped out. The main character in the story is Peter Robinson, a man in his late forties, whose wife and daughter were in Boston when everyone was suddenly killed. Robinson also finds a stray dog, whom he names Gandalf, and his bonding with the dog helps him cope with the death of his family. Bit by bit, it's revealed that Robinson has but one neighbour left, an old man called Timlin, who lives in a luxurious cottage called Veronica and who Robinson befriends over the course of time. The story narrates Robinson's emotions and musings, and the advice given to him by Timlin. Timlin has much more knowledge about the radiation crisis than Robinson, and tells him how those who did survive will slowly die of radiation poisoning. He is proven right by the death of most of the animals in the surrounding wilderness, and further so when Gandalf's health rapidly deteriorates. Robinson later finds Timlin with a gun on his table. Timlin says he is dying of radiation poisoning, but he doesn't want his death to be slow and painful, and hence has decided to shoot himself with the gun. He gives Robinson a hypodermic needle and advises him to put Gandalf out of his misery and not let him suffer. Timlin later kills himself. Robinson, despite his love and concern for the stricken animal, injects Gandalf with the needle. Robinson himself starts showing symptoms of terminal radiation poisoning the very next day, and he decides to end his life on his own terms as well. He gets his favorite motorcycle, a Fat Bob (whose sound is described as being like summer thunder), running again. He then takes one final, exhilarating ride on it before making a suicidal run directly at a road sign.  References  * \\"Summer Thunder\\" featured in Turn Down the Lights * King, Stephen.

Life He was born in London in 1594, the second son of Lambert Osbaldeston, a haberdasher, of London, by his wife Martha Banks. Educated at Westminster School, he was elected to a scholarship at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1612. His name does not, however, appear in the matriculation register of the university until 20 October 1615, when he is described as the son of a \\"gentleman\\" born in London, and aged 21. He was admitted a student of Gray's Inn, London, on 25 October 1615. He graduated B.A. at Oxford on 13 June 1616, and took his M.A. on 20 April 1619. On 7 December 1621 he had a joint patent (with John Wilson) from the dean and chapter of Westminster of the headmastership of Westminster School, which was renewed to him alone on 27 January 1625/6. He was incorporated in the degree of M.A. at Cambridge in 1628. In July 1629 he became prebendary of the tenth stall in the collegiate church of Westminster Abbey, and on the 18th of the same month he was collated by his friend John Williams, Bishop of Lincoln to the prebend of Biggleswade in Lincoln Cathedral. He was also a prebendary of Ilton in Wells Cathedral, and in 1637 he was presented to the rectory of Wheathampstead, with the chapel of Harpenden, Hertfordshire. In 1638 certain letters written by him were found in the house of Bishop Williams at Buckden. In these letters an unnamed person was irreverently styled \\"the little urchin\\" and \\"the little meddling hocus pocus.\\" There can be no reasonable doubt that the person referred to was the Archbishop of Canterbury, William Laud, right- hand man to King Charles I. Williams and Osbaldeston were brought to trial in the Star Chamber on 14 February 1638‚Äì9, and the latter was condemned to lose all his spiritualities, to pay a fine of ¬£5,000. to the king and a like sum to Archbishop Laud, and moreover to have his ears nailed in the pillory in the presence of his Westminster scholars. As soon as the major part of the court had passed censure upon him, and while the lord-keeper was giving his judgment, Osbaldeston got out of the court, hurried to his study at the school, burnt some documents, and wrote on a paper, which he left on his desk: \\"If the archbishop inquire after me, tell him I am gone beyond Canterbury.\\" Messengers were consequently sent to the port towns to apprehend him; but he lay hid in a private house in Drury Lane till the parliament met in November 1640. He had of course been deprived, in the meantime, of his church preferments, but he was restored to them by the Long parliament in 1641. Subsequently, he was shocked at the lengths to which that assembly proceeded, and his benefices were again sequestered. The latter part of his life was passed in retirement; he died in possession of his preferments \\"as much as the times would allow.\\" He bore the character of a learned man, and was an excellent master, being \\"very fortunate in breeding up many wits.\\" It is also said that he \\"had at the present [1638] above fourscore doctors in the two universities, and three learned faculties, all gratefully acknowledging their education under him\\". The \\"Tragical History of Piramus and Thisbe,\\" one of Abraham Cowley's Poetical Blossoms (1633), is dedicated \\"To the Right Worshipful, my very loving Master, Mr. Lambert Osbolston.\\" Another of his scholars was Thomas Randolph, who addressed to him a poem, prefixed to the \\"Jealous Lovers,\\" 1638. Osbaldeston died in October 1659, and on the seventh of that month was buried in the south aisle of Westminster Abbey, without any memorial.

She went on to earn the first master's degree in the field and then became the first woman professor to teach engineering at Iowa State University (ISU). Her first project was as an assistant on the design of the Marston Water Tower on the ISU campus. After teaching for a decade at the school, she moved to New York City to enter private practice. Wilson worked with the James E. Brooks Company, skyscraper design firm Purdy and Henderson, and the John Severn Brown Company. Early life Elmina Tessa Wilson was born on 29 September 1870 in Harper, Keokuk County, Iowa to Olive (n√©e Eaton) and John C. Wilson. She was the second-to-the-youngest daughter in a family of five other siblings, Warren, Fanny, Olive, Anna, and Alda. In 1892, she graduated from Iowa State University (ISU) with the first four-year civil engineering degree awarded any woman from an American university. In 1894, Elmina graduated with a master's degree in civil engineering from ISU, simultaneously with sister Alda's graduation with a bachelor's in the same field. Both sisters were members of Pi Beta Phi women's fraternity and staunch supporters of both women's education and suffrage. Career Marston water tower, designed in 1895 by Anson Marston and Elmina Wilson Soon after her graduation, Wilson began working at ISU, first as an assistant in the school's drafting room and then was promoted as an instructor the following year. In 1895, she collaborated on a project with a professor, Anson Marston, which was the first elevated steel water tower to be constructed west of the Mississippi. The tower, which became known as the Marston Water Tower, was completed in 1897. After finishing the project, Wilson took a winter course in hydraulics at Cornell University and returned to teaching physics at ISU. During her summer breaks, she worked with Alda in Chicago with the firm of Patton & Miller, doing drafting work and for the next two winter breaks, she studied at Massachusetts Institute of Technology earning a graduate degree. She returned to work at ISU as an assistant professor of physics and began publishing several articles in the Iowa Engineer about testing cement formulas. Most of the courses she taught focused on civil engineering and dealt with structures. In the fall of 1903, Wilson and her sister Alda took a sabbatical to study engineering and architectural designs in Europe. Traveling mostly on bicycles, they visited England, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Scotland and Switzerland. Upon their return to the states in 1904, Wilson resigned from her post at ISU and sought private employment in New York City with the James E. Brooks Company. Her first assignment with the firm was at the Essex Structural Steel Works in Bloomfield, New Jersey. In 1906, she began working on publications with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and a brochure entitled Modern Conveniences for the Farm Home was serialized in several newspapers nationally. Articles included topics such as piping water pumped by a windmill throughout rural homes or adding bathtubs serviced by water pumped from elevated tanks in an attic or pneumatic cylinders installed in basements, The following year, Wilson joined the prestigious engineering firm of Purdy and Henderson, leaders in skyscraper design, where she began work on the Flatiron Building and later worked on the Met Life Tower. In December 1907, the sisters sailed aboard the White Star Line's ship Adriatic, returning to Europe to spend six months studying architecture in France and Spain. Returning home, they worked together on the design of a residence in Ames, Iowa for W. J. Freed and his daughter Kittie. In 1911, Wilson served as president of the New York Chapter of the Pi Beta Phi Alumni Club. Then she was hired as a structural designer in 1912 by the John Severn Brown Company. In 1913, the sisters planned another trip, to study for eight months in Germany, Italy, and Sicily. In 1915, the sisters jointly worked on architectural and engineering drawings for the Teachers Cottage, also known as Helmich House, in Gatlinburg, Tennessee at the Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts. Wilson applied for membership along with Nora Blatch in the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), but was rejected. Blatch later sued the organization to attain membership. The sisters were involved with the Manhattan Woman's Suffrage Club, for which Elmina served as president, coming in contact with national leaders like Susan B. Anthony, Carrie Chapman Catt and Eleanor Roosevelt. Due to their Iowa ties and suffrage involvement, the Wilson sisters became personal friends with Catt, for whom Alda would later become a companion and secretary. Wilson died on June 4, 1918, in New York City and was buried there. Projects Design of the Marston Water Tower began in 1895 when a drought caused a severe water shortage. The project lead was Anson Marston, dean of the engineering department at Iowa State University, with Wilson assisting. The design of the and water tower, included eight columns, rather than the standard four, to safely support the 162,000-gallon structure. It was also the first steel, rather than wood, elevated tower west of the Mississippi River. The tower was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981, three years after it was decommissioned as the water reservoir and pressure regulation system for the campus water supply. In 1909, Wilson and her sister Alda designed a residence for W. J. Freed and his daughter Kittie. The house was a six-room cottage located on Story Street in Ames, Iowa. Helmich House, Arrowmont School Helmich House was designed in 1915 and was the first known architect-designed dwelling in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. It was part of the campus of Arrowmont School, a project promoted by Phi Beta Phi as a settlement house-type program based on the model of the agricultural schools in vogue in the Progressive Era. The ten-room residence was a 1¬Ω-story frame bungalow on a concrete foundation. Built in 1916, the residence, which was constructed to provide living quarters for the teachers being recruited to work in the school, had modern amenities including the first furnace in Gatlinburg and running water. The exterior was clad with weatherboard siding featuring shed dormers on the north and rear fa√ßades, covered by a side- gabled, asphalt-shingled roof. In 2007, the teacher's residence was placed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Settlement School Community Outreach Historic District of Sevier County, Tennessee.

The name literally translates to \\"Muslim Action Committee\\" in English. History The Comit√© d'Action Musulman (CAM) party was founded by Sir Abdool Razack Mohamed in February 1959 in preparation for the March 1959 General Elections. In the early 1950s Abdool Razack Mohamed distanced himself from the Labour Party and became part of the Jules Koenig's Union Mauricienne (UM) which was founded in 1953. Koenig's UM claimed to be the roadblock which would prevent minorities from being swamped away by the Hindu majority. Thus A.R. Mohamed explained that minorities such as Muslims would be better protected from Hindu hegemony by Koenig's party especially with the impending constitutional changes by the British administration. On the UM's platform Abdool Razack attacked the Labour Party and especially its emerging leader Dr. Seewoosagur Ramgoolam. Mohamed openly accused Ramgoolam of supporting Hindu nationalists. At a 1955 public meeting he warned that Muslims would not be used as a stepping stone to further other politicians' objectives especially on the growing issue of independence from colonial England. The local press reported that Mohamed believed that \\"Muslims do not want an independence whereby we will all be dominated by Ramgoolam\\". Koenig changed the name of his Union Mauricienne to Ralliement Mauricien shortly before the 1953 elections. In 1953 A.R. Mohamed was nominated for the first time to the Legislative Council as a member of Koenig's new Ralliement Mauricien in Port Louis as fourth member, behind the 3 elected Labour Party candidates. He thus became the first ever Muslim to enter the Legislative Council. However A.R. Mohamed was not welcome within Koenig's Union Mauricienne. Indeed shortly after the 1953 elections Koenig's party endorsed their defeated candidate's Alex Bhujoharry's protest for a recount of votes after Mohamed was elected ahead of Bhujoharry by 5 votes in Port-Louis. This was soon followed by the white lobby to oust A.R. Mohamed from the Executive Committee of Koenig's Union Mauricienne. The white Franco-Mauritian elite within UM also denied his nomineeship to the Executive Council and chose Osman instead of Mohamed. Finally Koenig's party rejected Abdool Razack's request for a separate electoral roll and reserved seats for Muslims. Groups of Muslims published letters in the press to urge A.R. Mohamed to return to the Labour party. But Mohamed was reluctant to do so due to the presence of his arch-rival Edgar Millien and other factors. Thus in 1959 Abdool Razack Mohamed founded his own party called Comit√© d'Action Musulman (CAM). Soon afterwards the CAM contracted an alliance with the Labour Party. Seewoosagur Ramgoolam even attended the first meeting of the new CAM which was held in February 1959 at Plaine Verte. Within the Labour Party the alliance was well accepted as Edgar Millien had started to distance himself from the Labour Party. Besides Renganaden Seeneevassen and Guy Rozemont had already died. Earlier in 1956 Seeneevassen had successfully lobbied the government to instigate the Keith- Lucas commission to investigate allegations of fraud during the Mohamed's tenure as Lord Mayor in 1953. Indeed there had been serious allegations of fraud during the 1953 municipal elections in Port-Louis which resulted in Abdool Razack's election to office. Splitting of Indo-Mauritian community Despite the CAM's alliance with the Labour Party Mohamed persisted with his demand for a separate electoral roll and reserved seats for the Muslims. His approach had been shaped by the All India Muslim League's strategy of the 1950s which successfully weakened the rising Indian nationalism. Mohamed's approach had the unexpected outcome of arousing communal passions within other communities as other politicians decided to adopt Abdool Razack's communal partitioning approach. The 1957 London Agreement split the Indo-Mauritians into 2 distinct communities: Indo-Mauritian Hindus and Indo-Mauritian Muslims. The Indo-Mauritian Muslim community was thus recognised as distinct section of the population. The Trustram Eve's Electoral Boundary Commission (EBC) introduced a new electoral system and a re-zoning of constituencies in 1959. The EBC facilitated the election of Muslims in some constituencies without having to rely on other communities anymore. Trustam Eve thus enabled Mohamed to position himself as the leader of the Muslim community. As a result during the 1959 general elections 5 Muslims were elected and Abdool Razack received the credit for this achievement. In 1959 he was appointed to his first ministerial position (Minister of Housing). Independence Party coalition Following the 1960 visit by Secretary of State Ian Macleod to the island of Mauritius Abdool Razack became aware of the inevitability of independence. Thus changes in the Constitution and electoral system were bound to occur and would once again affect Muslims' representation. The 1965 Constitutional Conference Report outlined the positions of the parties present at Lancaster House and stated that the only 2 parties advocating immediate independence were the Labour Party and Sookdeo Bissoondoyal's Independent Forward Bloc (IFB). The Secretary of State Anthony Greenwood declared that Mauritius had reached the ultimate status for independence and that the 1963 general elections had already been an indicator of the overwhelming support of independence given that when combined the Labour Party and the IFB gathered 61.5 % of the votes. The report did not give weight to the indecisiveness of the CAM on the issue of independence. The CAM gathered politician J. Ah Chuen's support to ensure that the Secretary of State developed a formula for safeguarding the interests of minority groups in the Legislative Assembly. This formula became known as the \\"Best Loser\\" system which has now survived for several decades. In 1967 the CAM became part of the coalition called Independence Party which held office after the August 1967 elections in preparation for independence from Great Britain in March 1968 despite the deadly January 1968 Mauritian riots and State of Emergency. The Independence Party consisted of the 3 main parties Parti Travailliste (PTr), Independent Forward Bloc (IFB) and the CAM. This coalition campaigned against the PMSD and a few other minor parties which were opposed to the concept of an independent Mauritius. In 1976 the CAM suffered electoral defeat in its main constituencies as newer party Mouvement Militant Mauricien (MMM) rose in popularity.

Early life He was born in a rich zamindar family of Kundesar village in Ghazipur district of Uttar Pradesh. His father Babu Krinamohan Singh was very fond of wrestling and he nurtured his son with great care. Though he didn't allow his son to participate in any tournaments or competitions but his rising fame of unimaginable regimen of exercises drew attention of renowned wrestlers of his time. The great Gama pehlwan was his contemporary. In those days he was a court wrestler of Datia Princely State. When he learned about Harinarayan Singh's encounter with a lion, he came to challenge him in akhara. However he couldn‚Äôt gather any courage when he saw his 95 kg exercising naal.Sanmarg,Hindi Daily, Varanasi, 5 June 1949. Tough training Mall Babu used to do five thousands squats and five thousands push- ups. Though it seems unimaginable but sports journalist Marcus Trower has mentioned it in his well researched book, \\"The most I heard anyone talk about a wrestler having done was 10,000 of each a day. This was Hari Narayan Singh, the wrestler who killed a lion in the 1880s whose story I tell.\\" Encounter with a tiger In 1885, Hari Narayan Singh was traveling to Vadodara Gujarat on a pilgrimage with his Purohit and Nayee. Due to lack of any transport facility in those days they were moving ahead on foot. After few miles they approached a road through dense forest where British sepoys warned them of danger ahead. They informed Mall babu about a man-eater in that area and suggested to take another route which was much longer. But Hari Narayan Singh didn't pay heed to their warning and moved forward with his companions. When they were in the middle of the jungle suddenly they heard the roar of lion. Mall babu told his Purohit and Nayee to climb on trees immediately and he started waiting for man-eater with a wrestler's prudence. Suddenly lion jumped on him and injured his shoulder ripping his flesh. But vigilant young wrestler got hold of his forelegs and hit him hard in spine. The lion roared and collapsed. His spine was broken and within few minutes he was gasping his last breath. Accomplished mridang player Hari Narayan Singh was an accomplished mridang player. After exercise in akhara he used to practise Mridang. In zamindar family of Kundesar frequent visits of musicians were very common. But the all used to get mesmerized seeing a wrestler playing mridang in classical Rupak Taal and Teen Taal. Sharp memory Babu Hari Narayan Singh was not like a usual wrestler of his time, who used to sleep all day long after practising in akhara. He was a keen learner and voracious reader. His memory was so sharp that he memorized the entire text of Shrimad Bahgwat Geeta.Kesari,Hindi Monthly Magazine, Varanasi, August 1949. Death and legacy Mall Babu was such a disciplined person that he didn't fell ill in his lifetime. Till the age of 84 years his physique was in greater shape. However, in the age of 85 he got a premonition of his death and according to his wish he was shifted to holy city of Varanasi, where he died on 4 June 1949. Mall Babu had few disciples who carried forward his legacy. Rajnarayan Rai was his most favorite, who floored Imam Bakhs Pahalwan (younger brother of The Great Gama) in Jhariya (Jharkhand) within 5 minutes of bouts. Gama was so shocked with this defeat that he started crying.
