The first Baháʼí to visit came in 1927 while pioneers arrived by 1956 and the first Baháʼí Local Spiritual Assembly was elected in 1957 In 1971 the first Baháʼí National Spiritual Assembly was elected. A count of the community then noted 27 assemblies with Baháʼís living in 77 locations. Since then Baháʼís have participated in several projects for the benefit of the wider community and between 2005 and 2010 various sources report near 1.2% of the country, about 10,000–16,000 citizens, are Baháʼís.  Pre-history  ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, the son of the founder of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book titled Tablets of the Divine Plan. The sixth of the tablets was the first to mention Latin American regions and was written on April 8, 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919—after the end of the First World War and the Spanish flu. The sixth tablet was translated and presented by Mirza Ahmad Sohrab on April 4, 1919, and published in Star of the West magazine on December 12, 1919. > His Holiness Christ says: Travel ye to the East and to the West of the world > and summon the people to the Kingdom of God.…(travel to) the Islands of the > West Indies, such as Cuba, Haiti, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, the Islands of the > Lesser Antilles(which includes Trinidad and Tobago), Bahama Islands, even > the small Watling Island, have great importance… In 1927 Leonora Armstrong was the first Baháʼí to visit and give lectures about the Baháʼí Faith in many Latin American countries including Trinidad and Tobago as part of her plan to complement and complete Martha Root's unfulfilled intention of visiting all the Latin American countries for the purpose of presenting the religion to an audience. = Seven Year Plan and succeeding decades = Shoghi Effendi wrote a cable on May 1, 1936, to the Baháʼí Annual Convention of the United States and Canada, and asked for the systematic implementation of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's vision to begin. In his cable he wrote: > Appeal to assembled delegates ponder historic appeal voiced by ʻAbdu'l-Bahá > in Tablets of the Divine Plan. Urge earnest deliberation with incoming > National Assembly to insure its complete fulfillment. First century of > Baháʼí Era drawing to a close. Humanity entering outer fringes most perilous > stage its existence. Opportunities of present hour unimaginably precious. > Would to God every State within American Republic and every Republic in > American continent might ere termination of this glorious century embrace > the light of the Faith of Baháʼu'lláh and establish structural basis of His > World Order. Following the May 1 cable, another cable from Shoghi Effendi came on May 19 calling for permanent pioneers to be established in all the countries of Latin America. The Baháʼí National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada appointed the Inter-America Committee to take charge of the preparations. During the 1937 Baháʼí North American Convention, Shoghi Effendi cabled advising the convention to prolong their deliberations to permit the delegates and the National Assembly to consult on a plan that would enable Baháʼís to go to Latin America as well as to include the completion of the outer structure of the Baháʼí House of Worship in Wilmette, Illinois. In 1937 the First Seven Year Plan (1937–44), which was an international plan designed by Shoghi Effendi, gave the American Baháʼís the goal of establishing the Baháʼí Faith in every country in Latin America. With the spread of American Baháʼís in Latin American, Baháʼí communities and Local Spiritual Assemblies began to form in 1938 across the rest of Latin America. A few other Baháʼís are known to have visited the islands before WWII. Mr. and Mrs. Dudley Blakeley visited on their way out from New York city and back during a tour of the Caribbean in 1936–37 with their visit resulting in a newspaper story. Wilfred Barton traveled the region and made contact with Trinidadians circa 1939. Anecdotes of a Trinidadian in Canada report a sensitivity to actually being treated equally most probably this is a report of Ralph Laltoo, a student from Trinidad, and son of a United Church Minister. He converted to the religion in October 1940 while in Canada.Black Roses in Canada's Mosaic: Four Decades of Black History by Will C. van den Hoonaard and Lynn Echevarria- Howe,1994-02Ralph Laltoo appears in a picture at While the first known Trinidadian Baháʼí however returning to Trinidad in 1943 there would have been no Baháʼí community to be with him and he developed other connections while serving at Naparima College. When Hand of the Cause Dorothy Beecher Baker died in an airplane crash in 1954 in Europe she had been intending to travel to Trinidad. Another early contact between the Baháʼí Faith and a Trinidadian was noticed in 1954 by a policeman serving in Nassau. Dr. Malcolm King promulgated the religion while traveling among the islands starting in 1950. King taught the religion to Mrs. Harriet Phillip, sister to Dr. Cyril Turney, fellow convert and friend to King. Mrs. Phillip became the first person living in Trinidad to convert to the religion. Cyril Turney returned, in 1957, with his daughter, Violet, to Trinidad, where he lived in Belmont. His brother, Albert Turney, later converted and had the first Baháʼí funeral held in his name, when he died. With local converts and a few pioneers, the first Baháʼí Local Spiritual Assembly was subsequently elected in Port of Spain in 1957.  Inter/National development  As far back as 1951 the Baháʼís had organized a regional National Assembly for the combination of Mexico, Central America and the Antilles islands. Further Baháʼís continued to travel to Trinidad and Tobago. Winston Evans toured the Caribbean including Trinidad in 1957. In 1962 Joel Caverly from Massachusetts came to Trinidad for the first time as a member of the music band from the Washington DC Navy School of Music. Israel Posner from Venezuela toured Trinidad promoting the religion in 1964 and was followed by two pioneers from England, Mr. and Mrs. John Firman. The Port of Spain assembly had lapsed but was reformed in 1965 - its members were: Mrs. Baptiste, John Firman, Mrs. Philips, Mrs. Firman, Mr. Paris, Miss Hopkinson, Mrs. George, Mr. Kedheroo, Mrs. Coure. That year the Trinidad Sunday Mirror published a photo of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá and an article with the title \\"A Message of Peace and New Way of Life.\\" There were some developments in 1966 - reorganized as a regional national assembly among the Baháʼís of Leeward, Windward and Virgin Islands with its seat in Charlotte Amalie and Anthony Worley from Brazil was appointed as the twelfth member of the Auxiliary Board to foster the development of the religion for the area including the Guianas and Trinidad and Tobago. During October 1966 a trip to ten islands including Trinidad was planned by Lorraine Landau, a pioneer in Barbados who was elected to the regional national assembly. With further pioneers and converts by 1969 there were two additional local assemblies: Arima and San Fernando, and the number of Baháʼís had been raised to 285. Caverly returned and was living in Saint James where he and his fiancé became the first Baháʼí couple to be married in Trinidad and Tobago on August 4, 1970 Among the more notable visitors to the country were two Hands of the Cause, a select group of Baháʼís, appointed for life, whose main function is to serve the worldwide interests of the religion. First, Ruhiyyih Khanum visited for a few days in May. The second, Enoch Olinga, visited the country for five days at the beginning of September. In October he visited the island of Tobago for a few days as well. Both met with many local and regional dignitaries as well as meeting with Baháʼís and journalists. In 1971 the first Baháʼí National Spiritual Assembly was elected. Its members were: Ramdass Ramkissoon, Don Swihert, Joel Caverly, Dr. Lavern Johnson, Leo Fraser, Edna Ruth Caverly, Nikou Amarsingh, Shamsi Sedegat, and Fitzroy Soukoo. A count of the community then noted 27 assemblies with Baháʼís living in 77 locations. That same year the national assembly established a correspondence course for Baháʼís who signed up to learn more formally about their religion and had community news latter functioning. Map showing old counties of Trinidad And a third Hand of the Cause visited in 1972 - Dr. Ugo Giachery came specifically as a representative from the Universal House of Justice, head of the religion since 1963, for its second national convention (with 17 delegates). Giachery's visit had coverage from Trinidadian newspaper and radio journalists and receptions for civic leaders. Diverse activities were then coordinated including - sending local pioneers to more localities across the country, donating several works to the national library system (Baháʼu'lláh and the New Era, Some Answered Questions, Divine Art of Living, and Paris Talks), interfaith meetings, a regular children's classes, and a regular six-minute contribution to a local radio station. The religion gained founding membership in Trinidad and Tobago's Inter-Religious Organization in 1972 lapsing only when it felt the organization was acting too political. In 1975 the first national youth conference of the Baháʼís of Trinidad and Tobago was held in November attended by some 70 youth followed by a national conference on the promulgation of the religion in the country with 75 attendees from most of the administrative units of the country in 1976. The first Carib Indians of Trinidad to join the religion that year. Other Iranian pioneers were known in Trinidad in 1976. Meanwhile, Baháʼís from Trinidad and Tobago show up as visitors to Barbados in the 1960s and 70s.Travel Teachers to Barbados, Welcome to Barbados, Baha'i History in the Caribbean by Pat Paccassi Hand of the Cause Enoch Olinga revisited in February 1977. Around this time three district Baháʼí centers were raised up - in Sangre Grande, San Fernando and one in Tobago - in addition to the national center and a surge in conversions. In 1978 Shirin Boman, serving as a Continental Counselor of the religion, toured the country with public and private meetings and interviews. The 1981 Baháʼí Naw-Rúz, or \\"New Year\\", was observed with the presence of a number of dignitaries and an early comment by a government official on the Persecution of Baháʼís in Iran. An early implementation of the Ruhi Institute system occurred in 1982. In 1983 the Baháʼís invited national civic leaders and university professors to a special dinner and viewed a film of the testimony in the US Congress of the incidence of the persecution of Baháʼís in Iran along with introductory materials on the religion. = Developmental projects = Since its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development The Baháʼís of Trinidad and Tobago organized an observation of the UN International Year of the Child in 1979 and Baháʼís became formerly invited to work with one area school. An open Baháʼí Women's conference was held in 1979 with Baháʼí and non-Baháʼí women attending. A national children's conference was held in November 1980 with about 120 children plus adults and youth followed by a youth conference in December and conference on the growth of the religion in January 1981. Also in 1981 the Baháʼís participated in an interfaith meeting at the Port of Spain town hall. Three schools in the country formally introduced classes on the religion in 1981–2 school year. Baháʼís continued to be active in developmental circles related to children.NGO Report on the situation of Children in Trinidad and Tobago, YMCA of Trinidad & Tobago, February 1997  Modern community  In the 1990s youth conferences and proclamation events, and Ruhi Institute meetings multiplied. The national center was renovated circa 1998–2000. A Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, Dr. Daphne Phillips, spoke at the official opening of the National Baháʼí Center in Port of Spain on 12 November 2000 addressing an audience of some 200 people.Home > Locations > Baháʼí Centres > National Baháʼí Centres, Baha'i Media Bank, Nov 12, 2000 Youth, women, and minorities are among those taking the lead in becoming tutors on Ruhi Institute courses in Trinidad and Tobago since 2006.

Lassonde also incorporates crossover programming with York University’s Schulich School of Business and Osgoode Hall Law School to study law, business and entrepreneurship alongside the engineering program. The Lassonde School of Engineering was established in November 2011 with funding from founding donor Pierre Lassonde, the Government of Ontario and York University. Former students in Engineering, Computer Science and Earth & Atmospheric Science programs from the Faculty of Science and Engineering formally joined the Lassonde School of Engineering on May 1, 2013. On April 8, 2016 Bergeron Centre for Engineering Excellence opened. The building, designed by Greg Woods for ZAS Architects has no lecture halls and is modelled after the flipped classroom concept. The façade was designed by Dieter Janssen in collaboration with Mesh Consultants and Blackwell Engineering.  History  The Lassonde School of Engineering was created in November 2011. In May 2013 students and faculty members in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and the Department of Earth & Space Science & Engineering (both previously part of the Faculty of Science and Engineering at York University) joined the Lassonde School of Engineering. In September 2013 the first group of new first-year Lassondians, 397 students, joined the Lassonde School, including the first students in the new Electrical Engineering program. In September 2014 the first students in Lassonde's new mechanical engineering and civil engineering programs begin their studies at Lassonde. The Lassonde School of Engineering challenged itself with a 50-50 initiative to have a student body that is 50% female and 50% male. In April 2016 the Bergeron Centre for Engineering Excellence was officially opened, becoming the newest engineering building on the York-Keele campus. The Lassonde School of Engineering is known for their \\"Renaissance Engineering\\" philosophy, which focuses on creating more \\"well-rounded\\" engineers with a curriculum to inspire creative, ingenious thinking. At the heart of this philosophy is Bergeron Entrepreneurs in Science and Technology (BEST) which combines curricular and co-curricular activities to support technology entrepreneurship at Lassonde and across York campus. www.bestlassonde.ca. BEST was funded by a donation from Doug and Sandra Bergeron, to help prepare graduating students for careers that don't yet exist in organizations that don't yet exist. Doug Bergeron is a graduate of York University's computer Science Program. In October 2015, the Lassonde School of Engineering accepted $1.5 million from IFlytek to create a neural computing and machine learning research laboratory.

It was aired on April 15, 2013. The episode was written by Rockne S. O'Bannon (part 1) and Kevin Murphy & Michael Taylor (part 2). Both parts were directed by Scott Stewart. Plot Nolan (Grant Bowler) and Irisa (Stephanie Leonidas) drive through the terraformed landscape of Earth and observe an Arkfall event. They find the impact site and search the wreckage for salvageable technology, recovering a spherical power source. They are ambushed by Irathient marauders but escape with the sphere; Irisa is wounded and collapses. Nolan hides the sphere and then fights off an attack by spider-like creatures until he runs out of ammunition; he and Irisa are rescued by lawkeepers who escort them to the nearby settlement of Defiance, which is built on the ruins of St. Louis, Missouri. The people of Defiance are celebrating the anniversary of the end of the Pale Wars and the founding of Defiance, which is home to a mixture of Human and Votan survivors of the wars. The mayor, Amanda (Julie Benz), seems to be losing faith in her ability to lead the people of the town. To make matters worse, tensions are rising between Datak Tarr (Tony Curran), a wealthy and influential Castithan, and Rafe McCawley (Graham Greene), owner of the mines that fuel much of the local economy. Irisa is taken to the Indogene Doctor Yewll's (Trenna Keating) office to be treated; she recovers from her injuries. A budding romance between Tarr's son Alak (Jesse Rath) and McCawley's daughter Christie (Nicole Muñoz) is met with disapproval from her older brother Luke (Wesley French), and he and Alak have a minor but uneventful scuffle before Luke excuses himself from the festivities and disappears. Later that night Luke meets someone on the edge of Defiance and is killed. Meanwhile, with no money and no equipment, Nolan attempts to make a quick fortune prizefighting; he wins, but most of his winnings are confiscated by Datak Tarr, who runs the prizefighting ring and, it seems, just about everything else in Defiance. McCawley, notified of Luke's death, pursues Alak in a rage with the intent of lynching him. Nolan intervenes; in the ensuing fight, the town lawkeeper (Peter MacNeill) is accidentally shot and killed. Nolan persuades Amanda to let him track down Luke's killer; he investigates and discovers that Luke was killed by a Votan \\"coldfire\\" weapon. Tracking the killer, Nolan and Amanda discover that it is her Indogene assistant, Ben (Douglas Nyback); Ben subsequently destroys the generator powering the shield which protects Defiance. They learn that a party of armed Volge are approaching Defiance with the intent of destroying the town. While Amanda attempts to rally the people of Defiance and construct a defense plan, Nolan and Irisa collect their reward and leave, retrieving the sphere. Nolan has second thoughts and returns to help defend Defiance and its people; Irisa, furious, leaves him behind. The people of Defiance attack the Volge in a narrow canyon outside Defiance. During the battle, another Castithan, Elah Bandik (Robert Clarke), displays cowardice and flees, infuriating Datak. The battle is going badly for Defiance until Irisa returns, leading the Irathient Spirit Riders to attack the Volge on the ground; Yewll then uses the sphere to completely destroy the Volge. Nolan and Irisa reunite and decide to remain in Defiance; Amanda persuades Nolan to become the new lawkeeper and Irisa becomes one of his deputies. At the end of the episode, it is revealed that former mayor Nicky Riordan (Fionnula Flanagan) and a man named Birch (Steven McCarthy) were behind Ben's treachery. They wanted the Volge to attack and destroy Defiance, for unknown reasons. Reception =Ratings= In its original American broadcast, \\"Pilot\\" was watched by 2.73 million. =Reviews= The critical reception of Defiance was \\"mixed or average\\" according to Metacritic, with a 57% rating according to 17 reviews. Maureen Ryan of The Huffington Post said that it was a relief seeing that Defiance kept the label of the science fiction compared to other shows that have skirted that label but they didn't please the sci-fi fans. \\"\\"Defiance\\" is not just a smart, well-crafted TV show with a good cast and an adventurous flavor, it's also indisputably science fiction, which is a relief. [...] I am very intrigued to see where \\"Defiance\\" goes.\\" Ellen Gray of the Philadelphia Daily News said that Defiance stands alone. \\"\\"Defiance\\" the TV show may not break new ground in its two-hour premiere Monday, but it does stand on its own as a watchable sci-fi series, with a Wild West vibe mixed with a bit of \\"Farscape\\"-meets-\\"West Side Story.\\" Curt Wagner from Redeye said that the premiere of the show was a messy mash-up since there were too many stories on it and it looked overloaded, but it had potential. \\"\\"Defiance\\" grew on me the more I watched. I'm encouraged by some of the continuing story threads that have been introduced [...] If the writers continue to develop characters as they've started with Irisa, \\"Defiance\\" could reach its potential and become more than an pale imitation of better sci-fi.\\" Rowan Kaiser from The A.V. Club gave a B+ to the episode saying that it's not only a show with potential but it's good from the start. \\"\\"[...] and there are no major warning signs preventing it from maintaining or improving that quality. The future of the future on television may depend on it.\\" Lisa Macklem from Spoiler TV said she had been anticipating the show’s first episode and she will definitely be tuning in to see how these stories play out. \\"There has been a lot of hype and a flurry of press leading up to the premiere of Defiance. I’ve been anticipating the show’s first episode since I had the opportunity to tour the set in October. The extensive work that went into creating the world of the show paid off in big ratings for SYFY and a satisfying start to what promises to be a long running series.\\" Jim Garner from TV Fanatic rated the episode with 4.7/5 and said, \\"Overall, I’m very pleased with the pilot; the show has done a good job of telling an engaging story IN the future without it being entirely about the future. Can this continue through the rest of the season? I think so, unless the shtako hits the fan!\\" Conversely, David Hinckley of the New York Daily News gave it one star out of five and found it to be \\"incomprehensible\\", but said \\"if you’re a sci-fi fan for whom this stuff can never be too complex, have at it.\\" Feature music In the \\"Pilot\\" of Defiance we can hear the following songs: *\\"Outside Over There\\" written by Brendan McCreary and performed by his band Young Beautiful In A Hurry *\\"Oh, Future\\" performed by Young Beautiful in a Hurry *\\"Besash\\" written by Bear McCreary & David J.

Activities In January 2005, Ta'ayush activists along with Gush Shalom, the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions, Machsom Watch, Anarchists Against the Wall and local residents of the Palestinian village Jayyous, began to plant hundred of olive saplings which they had brought with them to the plot of land where the bulldozers of the settlers had uprooted hundreds of olive trees. Advocate Wiam Shbeyta, an activist of the Ta'ayush movement said:- > \\"In spite of the police and army assertions, we do not recognise the > ownership of the settlers over this land. This land belongs to the Jayyous > villagers and the company \\"Geulat HaKarka\\" which is associated with the > settlers took control of it on the false assertion that it was sold to them. > The matter is still awaiting legal review, and we will not allow the > settlers to dictate facts on the ground, to grab Palestinian lands and to > commence establishing a new settlement on it\\". In 2007, after hearing that settlers had stolen a donkey from a Palestinian boy from Tuba, Ta'ayush went to the Havot Ma'on settlement to retrieve the donkey. The police and Israeli Defense Forces stopped them on the way to Tuba and at the entrance of Havot Ma'on. Ta'ayush activists have also aided residents of the un-recognized village of Dar al-Hanun in Wadi Ara to repave the road to the village after it was dug up by Israeli Interior Ministry employees, the demolition had been ordered by the Haifa Magistrate's Court May 2006. The village of Dar al-Hanun was founded 80 years ago by the Abu Hilal family on a hill near the Wadi Ara route, on land owned by the family. In 1949, when the land was transferred to Israeli sovereignty, the Israeli authorities did not recognize the village, and the residents were asked to move to nearby villages. The village of Yanun was abandoned in October 2004 when the harassment of the village by Avri Ran and his people became intolerable, leaving behind only two aged people who refused to accept the village decision to go. The village was re-occupied with the aid of peace activists from Ta'ayush and the International Solidarity Movement. David Nir of Ta'ayush was assaulted by Avri Ran in Yanun. One member, David Dean Shulman, recalls the gratitude the cave-dwellers of the South Hebron Hills express to the Ta'ayush volunteers who struggle to ensure that they can stay on their land: > The cave-dwellers tell and retell stories of the volunteers' visits the way > they tell epics; for these people, Ta'ayush matters, like oxygen to the > drowning'.' In 2011 Two Jewish settlers suspected of involvement in the beating of Midhat Abu Karsh, a 30-year-old Palestinian teacher and resident of as-Samu, were arrested as a result of a video recording of the incident that released by Ta'ayush which appeared on YouTube and in Israeli television.  Political position  Ta'ayush has been described as belonging to the radical left. The organization's activities, which, like Machsom Watch, Yesh Gvul and Women in Black are focused on specific issues, rather than an inclusive approach embracing all problems,Wendy Pullan,Britt Baillie (eds.), Locating Urban Conflicts: Ethnicity, Nationalism and the Everyday, Palgrave Macmillan 2013 p.156. are ignored by the Israeli mainstream but find support among Arab Palestinian parties and the extreme left. Ta'ayush has no ideology (attempts to form a constitution failed) and its members restrict their work to concrete activities of solidarity.Michael Riordon, An Unauthorized Biography of the World: Oral History on the Front Lines, Between the Lines, 2010 p.188. Ta'ayush has a pacifist agenda, being opposed to both the Israeli occupation and Palestinian movements that employ violent forms of resistance.Chris Farrands, Imad El-Anis, Roy Smith, Lloyd Pettiford, A New A-Z of International Relations Theory, I.B.Tauris, 2015 p.249 It openly opposes the measures taken by the state of Israel in the Occupied Territories, policies that lead to 'isolation, poor medical care, house arrest, the destruction of educational institutions, and a lack of water and food for Palestinians'. Ta'ayush activists underwrite civil disobedience, support a Two State Solution,Susan Neiman, Moral Clarity: A Guide for Grown-up Idealists, Random House,2009 pp.383-390, p.383. and routinely break the law as they consider government's decision to be illegal according to international law and therefore illegitimate.  Ezra Nawi affair  In January 2016, Channel 2 (Israel) broadcast footage of Ta'ayush activist Ezra Nawi boasting that he poses as a prospective Jewish purchaser of land from Palestinians, then provides the Palestinian National Security Forces with the names and telephone numbers of Palestinian land brokers willing to sell land to him. Nawi is both Jewish and Israeli, and the Palestinian legal code regards sale of land to Israelis as a capital offense. Nawi said such people are beaten and executed. In the recording, Nawi says \\"The Authority catches them and kills them.

Most gold coins minted since 1800 are 90–92% gold (22 karat), while most of today's gold bullion coins are pure gold, such as the Britannia, Canadian Maple Leaf, and American Buffalo. Alloyed gold coins, like the American Gold Eagle and South African Krugerrand, are typically 91.7% gold by weight, with the remainder being silver and copper. Traditionally (up to about the 1930s), gold coins have been circulation coins, including coin- like bracteates and dinars. Since recent decades, however, gold coins are mainly produced as bullion coins to investors and as commemorative coins to collectors. While modern gold coins are also legal tender, they are not observed in everyday financial transactions, as the metal value normally exceeds the nominal value. For example, the American Gold Eagle, given a denomination of 50 USD, has a metal value of more than $1,600 USD. The gold reserves of central banks are dominated by gold bars, but gold coins may occasionally contribute. Gold has been used as money for many reasons. It is fungible, with a low spread between the prices to buy and sell. Gold is also easily transportable, as it has a high value-to-weight ratio, compared to other commodities, such as silver. Gold can be re-coined, divided into smaller units, or re-melted into larger units such as gold bars, without destroying its metal value. The density of gold is higher than most other metals, making it difficult to pass counterfeits. Additionally, gold is extremely unreactive, hence it does not tarnish or corrode over time. History =Antiquity= Persian Achaemenid Daric, circa 490 BC Solidus of Roman Emperor Valentinian II Gold was used in commerce (beside other precious metals) in the Ancient Near East since the Bronze Age, but coins proper originated much later, during the 6th century BC, in Anatolia. The name of king Croesus of Lydia remains associated with the invention (although the Parian Chronicle mentions Pheidon of Argos as a contender). In 546 BC, Croesus was captured by the Persians, who adopted gold as the main metal for their coins. The most valuable of all Persian minted coinage still remains the gold drams, minted in 1 AD as a gift by the Persian King Vonones (Matthew 2.1–23). Ancient Greek coinage contained a number of gold coins issued by the various city states. The Ying yuan is an early gold coin minted in ancient China. The oldest ones known are from about the 5th or 6th century BC. Larger units such as the various talent measures (26 to up to 60 kg) were used for high value exchanges (similar to today's 400-troy-ounce (12.4 kg) \\"good delivery\\" gold bullion bar). = Middle Ages and Early Modern period = =Modern history= The German gold mark was introduced in 1873 in the German Empire, replacing the various local Gulden coins of the Holy Roman Empire. Gold coins then had a very long period as a primary form of money, only falling into disuse in the early 20th century. Most of the world stopped making gold coins as currency by 1933, as countries switched from the gold standard due to hoarding during the worldwide economic crisis of the Great Depression. In the United States, 1933's Executive Order 6102 forbade the hoarding of gold and was followed by a devaluation of the dollar relative to gold, although the United States did not completely uncouple the dollar from the value of gold until 1971. Gold-colored coins have made a comeback in many currencies. However, \\"gold coin\\" (in numismatic terminology) always refers to a coin that is (more or less) made of gold, and does not include coins made of manganese brass or other alloys. Furthermore, many countries continue to make legal tender gold coins, but these are primarily meant for collectors and investment purposes and are not meant for circulation. Collector coins 20-crown gold coin from Norway. Introduced in 1875, it became part of the Scandinavian Monetary Union, which was based on a gold standard. Norwegian gold reserves included tonnes of this and other coins, backing Norway's paper money. The coin was designed for circulation: \\"124 Stk. 1 Kil. f. G.\\" means that 124 pieces gave one kilogram of pure gold. Many factors determine the value of a gold coin, such as its rarity, age, condition and the number originally minted. Most gold coins minted since the late 19th century are worth slightly more than spot price, but many are worth significantly more. Gold coins coveted by collectors include the Aureus, Solidus and Spur Ryal. In July 2002, a very rare $20 1933 Double Eagle gold coin sold for a record $7,590,020 at Sotheby's, making it by far the most valuable coin ever sold up to that time (a 1794 Flowing Hair Dollar sold for over $10 million in January 2013). In early 1933, more than 445,000 Double Eagle coins were struck by the U.S. Mint, but most of these were surrendered and melted down following Executive Order 6102. Only a few coins survived. In 2007 the Royal Canadian Mint produced a gold coin with a face value of $1,000,000, though the gold content was worth over $2 million at the time. It measures in diameter and is thick. It was intended as a one-off to promote a new line of Canadian Gold Maple Leaf coins, but after several interested buyers came forward the mint announced it would manufacture them as ordered and sell them for between $2.5 million and $3 million. As of May 3, 2007, there were five orders. One of these coins was stolen when it was on exhibition at the Bode Museum in Berlin.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/27/giant-gold-coin-with- queens-head-stolen-from-berlin-museum Austria had previously produced a diameter 31 kg Philharmonic gold coin with a face value of €100,000. On October 4, 2007, David Albanese (president of Albanese Rare Coins) stated that a $10, 1804-dated eagle coin (made for President Andrew Jackson as a diplomatic gift) was sold to an anonymous private collector for $5 million. In 2012 the Royal Canadian Mint produced the world first gold coin with a 0.11–0.14ct diamond. The Queen’s Diamond Jubilee coin has been crafted in 99.999% pure gold with a face value of $300.

Bullion metals may be cast into ingots, or minted into coins. The defining attribute of bullion is that it is valued by its mass and purity rather than by a face value as money. While obsolete gold coins are primarily collected for their numismatic value, gold bullion coins today derive their value from the metal (gold) content – and as such are viewed by some investors as a \\"hedge\\" against inflation or a store of value. Many nations mint bullion coins. According to British HM Revenue & Customs investment coins are generally coins that have been minted after 1800, have a purity of not less than 900 thousandths, or have been legal tender in its country of origin. Although nominally issued as legal tender, these coins' face value as currency is far below that of their value as bullion. The European Commission publishes annually a list of gold coins which must be treated as investment gold coins in all EU Member States. The list has legal force and supplements the law. In the United Kingdom, HM Revenue and Customs have added an additional list of gold coins alongside the European Commission list. These are gold coins that HM Revenue & Customs recognise as falling within the exemption for investment gold coins. This second list does not have legal force. South Africa introduced the Krugerrand in 1967 to cater to this market; this was the reason for its convenient and memorable gold content – exactly one troy ounce. It was the first modern, low-premium (i.e. priced only slightly above the bullion value of the gold) gold bullion coin. Bullion coins are also produced in fractions of an ounce – typically half ounce, quarter ounce, and one-tenth ounce. Bullion coins sometimes carry a face value as legal tender. The face value is minted on the coin, and it is done so in order to bestow legal tender status on a coin, which generally makes it easier to import or export across national borders, as well as subject to laws against counterfeiting. However, their real value is measured as dictated by their troy weight, the current market price of the precious metal contained, and the prevailing premium that market wishes to pay for those particular bullion coins. The face value is always significantly less than the bullion value of the coin. Legal tender bullion coins are a separate entity to bullion gold. One enjoys legal tender status, the latter is merely a raw commodity. Gold has an international currency code of XAU under ISO 4217. ISO 4217 includes codes not only for currencies, but also for precious metals (gold, silver, palladium and platinum; by definition expressed per one troy ounce. Gold bullion coins usually come in 1 oz, 1/2 oz, 1/4 oz, 1/10 and 1/20 oz. sizes. Most countries have one design that remains constant each year; others (such as the Chinese Panda coins) have variations each year, and in most cases each coin is dated. A 1/10 oz bullion coin is about the same size as a U.S. dime. A 1 oz. gold bullion coin is about the size of a U.S. half dollar. The largest legal tender gold coin ever produced was unveiled in 2012 by the Perth Mint in Western Australia. Known as the \\"1 Tonne Gold Kangaroo Coin\\" and with a face value of one million dollars, it contains one metric tonne of 9999 pure gold, and is approximately 80 cm in diameter by 12 cm thick. Image:Goldeagle.jpgAmerican Gold Eagle Other gold bullion coins, many named after their design features, include: * Austrian Philharmonic * British Britannia * Canadian Maple Leaf * Chinese Panda * Gold Dinar * Malaysian Kijang Emas * Russian Chervonets * Russian George the Victorious * Swiss Vreneli * French Napoleon * Australian Gold Nugget * South African Krugerrand * Iranian Spring of Freedom  Fineness  Circulating gold coins were usually made of an alloy as other metals are mixed into the coin to make it more durable. Fineness is the actual gold content in a coin or bar and expressed as a \\"per mil\\", or thousandths. For example, a gold ingot identified as being .999 fine will be 999/1000 pure gold, with the other 1/1000 being impurities. Karat weight (K or kt) is a traditional fraction-based system used to denote the fineness of gold, with one karat being equal to 1/24 part of pure gold in an alloy. With the precision of modern assaying techniques, however, the fineness of gold ingots and bullion is more likely to appear as a decimal measurement. In this system, pure gold would be denoted as 1.000 fine. However, since absolutely pure gold is very soft and therefore not suitable for coinage or ingots, it is generally accepted worldwide that anything above .999 fine qualifies as 24K. Below is a karat weight to fineness conversion chart. Correlation between karats and fineness * 24 karats = .999 fine or above * 23 karats = .958 fine * 22 karats = .917 fine (the UK gold coin standard) * 21 karats = .875 fine * 20 karats = .833 fine * 18 karats = .750 fine * 16 karats = .667 fine * 14 karats = .583 fine * 10 karats = .417 fine The fineness is often converted to a percent, as well. If a gold coin has a fineness of .900, that is 90.0% pure gold. If a gold coin has a fineness of .850, then the gold coin is 85.0% pure. Coins have varied greatly in fineness through history. Notable historical standards that were closely adhered-to include the crown gold (22 karat) used in all English gold coins intended for circulation from 1526 onward, and 0.900 fine (21.6 kt), the standard for all American circulation-coins from 1837 onward. Fineness is not the only way to value a gold coin; a great deal of value in collector coins comes from condition and rarity. To a far lesser extent, even the value of gold bullion coins is influenced by their physical condition.  Grading coins  A coin's \\"grade\\" is a visual evaluation of the amount of wear on a coin. Coins with little wear are graded higher and therefore assigned higher prices than those with a lot of wear. However, low-grade, extremely rare coins can easily be more valuable than more widely available, higher grade coins of common dates. In the early years of coin collecting, three general terms were used to describe a coin's grade: * Good – Where details were visible but circulation had worn the surface * Fine – Features were less worn from circulation and a bit of the mint luster showed on the surfaces * Uncirculated – Details were sharp and there was a luster approaching the state of the coin at the mint, prior to general circulation As the collector market for coins grew rapidly in the late 19th century and early 20th century, it became apparent that a more precise grading standard was needed. Some coins were simply more fine than others, and some uncirculated coins showed more luster and far fewer marks than others. Terms like \\"gem uncirculated\\" and \\"very fine\\" began to see use, as more precise grading descriptions allowed for more precise pricing for the booming collector market. In 1948, a well-known numismatist by the name of Dr. William Sheldon attempted to standardized coin grading by proposing what is now known as the Sheldon Scale. Sheldon's scale, included in his famous work Penny Whimsy, was originally devised specifically for United States large cents, but it is now applied to all series. The scale runs from 0 to 70, where 0 means that you can tell that it was once a coin while 70 means that it is perfect. 60 is uncirculated, what the general public would consider perfect, with no wear whatsoever. There is a direct mapping from this scale to the older descriptive terms, but they are not always used in the same way. Below are the general characteristics that define different coin grades in the United States system. When grading coins, any defect should be noted, such as bent, scratched, etc. Cleaning or mutilations of any kind should be mentioned. * Basal or Poor - (PO1) A piece of metal that can be identified as a coin. * Fair - (FR2) The type of coin can be identified, the date may or may not be visible. * About Good - (AG3) The date can be read, but parts of the coin and legend are worn smooth. * Good – (G4 and G6) Legends, designs and dates are visible but heavily worn. * Very Good – (VG8 and VG10) Designs and date are clear but lacking details. The \\"full rim\\" (the line around the edge of the coin where it was raised up) must be visible. * Fine – (F12 and F15) All major details will be visible with the major details virtually complete. In this case, \\"Fine\\" describes concerning the condition of the coin – not the purity as described above. * Very Fine – (VF20, VF25, VF30, and VF35) More details are visible with major details virtually complete. * Extremely Fine (XF or EF) – (EF40/XF40 and EF45/XF45) Light wear on the high points with some mint luster present. * Almost Uncirculated (AU) – (AU50, AU53, AU55, and AU58) Small trace of wear visible on the highest points with at least half of the mint luster still present. * Uncirculated (UNC) or Mint State – (MS60 through MS70 inclusive) No trace of wear with some small nicks or marks present. * Proof – (PR or PF; numerical designation typically between 40 and 70). Coins specially struck for collectors. Usually mirror-like surface. Sand blast and matte proof in some series. Mint State (MS) – (Mint state 60 – 70) \\"Uncirculated\\" and \\"Mint State\\" are terms that are many times used interchangeably. MS 70 is considered a perfect coin. Extremely few regular issue coins are considered MS-70 although it is common for new, modern bullion coins to be given a grade of MS-70. The grading standards are different in different countries. The main standards applied outside the United States are presented in the following table. Coin grading is not an exact science. It is a subjective exercise and depends on the qualification and the experience of the appraiser. Industry leaders were extremely concerned that without a standardized grading system, the rare coin industry could face enormous problems. Therefore, on February 3, 1986, the Professional Coin Grading Service (PCGS) was formed and in 1987 the Numismatic Guaranty Corporation. Both associations have the same goal of grading coins. Other prominent grading organizations are the American Numismatic Association Certification Service (ANACS) and the Independent Coin Graders. The grading is usually done by three independent appraisers. A grading finalizer assigns the final grade of the coin and thereafter the coin is sonically sealed in a protective, inert plastic holder known as \\"slab\\". Other associations followed and are at present active. This third-party appraisal of a coin's physical condition, backed by a guarantee, and a national network of reputable coin dealers provided an extremely reliable form of protection for rare coin consumers who could then participate in the coin market with greater confidence.  Rarity factor  The value of coins depends on their rarity. There are several scales which have been developed for the definition of the rarity of a particular coin. The most common are the \\"Sheldon rarity scale\\" and the \\"Universal rarity scale\\". Counterfeits Balance for checking the weight of gold coins. For most of history, coins were valued based on the precious metal they contain. Whether a coin was actually made by the party as claimed was of secondary importance compared to whether it contains the correct amount of metal – that is, correct weight and fineness (purity). Genuine appearance was simply a convenient shortcut to avoid time-consuming tests in everyday transactions. Gold is denser than almost all other metals, hence hard to fake. A determination of weight and volume is in many cases sufficient to spot forgeries. A coin that is not gold or below the expected fineness will either have the right size but will have a lower than expected weight or it weighs right and will be somewhat larger. Most metals that are of similar or higher density than gold are similarly or more expensive, and were unknown in ancient times (notably the platinum group). During the 19th century platinum was cheaper than gold and was used for counterfeiting gold coins. These coins could be detected by acoustic properties. Only two relatively inexpensive substances are of similar density to gold: depleted uranium and tungsten. Depleted uranium is government-regulated, but tungsten is more commonly available and suited for counterfeiting. Alloying gold with tungsten would not work for several reasons, but tungsten plated with a thin layer of gold is a common type of forgery. Bullion coin counterfeits (of all types) used to be rare and fairly easy to detect when comparing their weights, colors and sizes to authentic pieces. This is because the cost of reproducing any given coin precisely can exceed the market value of the originals. However, since about 2015 counterfeit coins are \\"flooding the market at an astonishing rate\\" and \\"it's gotten to the point where even people who deal with coins all the time may not be able to recognize a counterfeit coin right away\\" (American Numismatic Association (ANA), 2016).Herb Weisbaum 2016. Glitters, but Not Gold: Fake Gold and Silver Coins ‘Flooding’ Market. nbcnews JUN 13 2016, https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/glitters-not-gold-fake-gold- silver-coins-flooding-market-n591201 The coins consist mostly of tungsten plated thinly with gold, have the correct weight, correct or near-correct dimensions and are professionally produced in China.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jy-_HnjroY&t;=610s The weight and dimensions of a coin of .999 fineness such as the Maple Leaf cannot be replicated precisely by a gold plated tungsten core, since tungsten has only 99.74% of the specific gravity of gold. However, forgeries of alloyed gold coins (such as American Gold Eagle or Krugerrand made from a crown gold alloy with 22 karats = .917 fineness) may have correct the correct weight and dimensions because of the lesser density of the alloy. Such forgeries can be detected testing the acoustic, electric resistance or magnetic properties. The latter method uses the fact that gold is weakly diamagnetic and tungsten is weakly paramagnetic. The effect is weak so that testing requires strong neodymium magnets and sensitive conditions (e.g., a gold coin hanging from 2 m long pendulum or placed on styrofoam floating on water), such tests can be performed without special equipment.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgPOPozHRow Forgeries using gold plated tungsten are also used in counterfeiting of gold bars. =Biting gold= The rationale for biting a coin was the supposed widespread dissemination of gold plated lead coins in the 19th century. Since lead is much softer than gold, biting the coins is a sensible test for counterfeiting. While fine gold is softer than alloyed gold, and galvanized lead is softer, biting coins can only detect the crudest of forgeries. And all \\"gold\\" coins minted for circulation in the UK and America since the Tudor period (1485-1603) contained copper which made them more durable and thus hard to bite. Biting a coin to determine whether it is genuine or counterfeit is a widespread cliché depicted in many films (like the 1917 The Immigrant), books (like the 1925 L'Or by Blaise Cendrars) and plays (like the 1938 Mother Courage which is set in the Thirty Years' War 1618-1648). According to a 2017 study, the assumed widespread practice of pirates biting into a coin is almost certainly a Hollywood myth. Olympic champions often pose biting their gold medals , even though the medals are no longer made of solid gold. Only at three Olympics (in 1904, 1908 and 1912) were medals made of solid gold, but were also smaller. David Wallechinsky commented in 2012 that \\"It's become an obsession with the photographers. I think they look at it as an iconic shot, as something that you can probably sell. I don't think it's something the athletes would probably do on their own.\\"Melonyce McAfee. CNN, 10 August 2012. =Numismatic fake samples= There are well made counterfeit gold coins in circulation. For example, the St. Gaudens Double Eagle omega counterfeit is infamous for its complexity and has fooled many numismatics experts. It is a high relief business strike, and due to the extensive wear on the die, these coins were not made for many years. Another example is the US $20 gold coin (\\"double eagle\\"), which has raised lettering around its rim. If the coin is uncirculated, the letters will be flat on top. If slightly rounded, and the coin is uncirculated, it is a counterfeit. There are other counterfeit double eagles in which the gold and copper alloy was not thoroughly mixed. These counterfeits will have a slightly mottled appearance.

Life and works Born to Sivagnanam and Rajeshwari. Presently researching based on Sea Turtles and Human Migration happened in the past by Tamil Community.He is also doing extensive research on Kumari Kandam. A graduate of physics, through self-study a bachelor in engineering and also in library science, remote sensing and his moving to Orissa in 1989 was a turning point for him, for it kindled his interest on the Orissan culture. Mr.S. Balasubramani researching in lost cities and turtle guided ocean routes for mapping the turtle corridor along the Indian coast and Indo pacific ocean. His interaction with the people around when he travels outside Tamil Nadu, which he has been doing very frequently and his establishing rapport with the coastal community and learning from the people, are a few examples of his novel approach. That he could attract the attention of Orissan royalty and the resulting friendship with it is another dimension of his personality. Researched on the Kalinga-Tamil relationship was the beginning which became his passion for research into the Tamil history. His present research area is ‘Culture through Geography.Going beyond the emotional approach to the existence of Lemuria, Balasubramani, in addition to the study of literary references, conducts experiments on the Tamil coast making use of the traditional knowledge of the coastal community. He claims, which is important, that the traditional sailors and fishermen have a lot to contribute towards our knowledge of navigation, tsunamis and how transgression and regression in the Tamil Nadu coast had affected history, society and livelihoods. He has been regularly interacting with research students, orienting the students for developing import substitutes in earth science equipment which will be ultimately help for archaeologist to redefine our cultural heritage. His another favorite ‘pastime’ is ‘capacity building’, creating a number of groups who participate in socially relevant activities using the history as a tool, for which, he says, he is ‘carrying Gandhi along with him’. His longtime works at south east Indian coast is on identifying turtle corridor on Indo- Pacific ocean through interdisciplinary ocean studies and combination of paleolithic peoples sea faring is creating an awareness on lateral approach on rediscovering our glory of the past. Now he is concentrating on his Integrated ocean culture research foundation.  About Kumarikandam Research  Kumrikandam and Lemuria were involved in marine exploration. Consequently, a number of studies in the sea have been done by analyzing the seabed populations of the sea, comparing the concepts of Lemuria Kumarikandam, the sea with the sea, and the southern seas, using modern marine technology integration and ocean exploration. He is doing field surveys at sea. Field surveys demonstrate the underlying facts of sea crossing in the Black Sea.

Building and commissioning Wivern was ordered in April 1918 as part of the 13th Order of the 1917-1918 Naval Programme. She was laid down on 19 August 1918 by J. Samuel White at Cowes, Isle of Wight, and launched on 16 April 1919. She was completed on 23 December 1919 and was commissioned into service the same day with the pennant number D66. Service history =Before World War II= After entering service with the fleet in 1919, Wivern was assigned to the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla, serving with that flotilla in the Atlantic Fleet and Mediterranean Fleet before being decommissioned, transferred to the Reserve Fleet, and placed in reserve. In 1939, Wivern was recommissioned as the fleet mobilised because of deteriorating diplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and Nazi Germany and was selected for assignment to the 16th Destroyer Flotilla based at Portsmouth in the event of war breaking out. =World War II= 1939 After the United Kingdom entered World War II on 3 September 1939, Wiverns assignment at Portsmouth was cancelled, and instead she was assigned to Western Approaches Command for convoy defence operations in the Western Approaches. On 5 September, she escorted Convoy GC 1 from the River Clyde in Scotland with the destroyers , , and . On 9 September she joined the destroyers and in escorting Convoy OB 2. In October 1939, Wivern was transferred to the 16th Destroyer Flotilla under Commander-in-Chief, The Nore at Harwich for convoy escort and patrol duty in the North Sea. After the destroyer detonated a magnetic mine off Harwich and sank at on the evening of 21 November 1939, Wivern steamed through the area at high speed on 22 November in an attempt to detonate any other mines in the area and clear the area for ship traffic. Wivern continued her North Sea operations without further major incident through the end of 1939 and into 1940. 1940 Wivern remained on convoy and patrol duty in the North Sea until May 1940, the month in which her pennant number was changed to I66. On 10 May, as the German invasion of the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France began, she was ordered to join the destroyer in Operation XD, consisting of demolition operations at Hook of Holland to prevent German forces from capturing important installations there intact. Accordingly, Wivern and Wild Swan went to Hook of Holland on 11 May, where Wivern took aboard the British diplomatic mission to the Netherlands for passage to Vlissingen. On 13 May, Wivern took part in Operation Ordnance, the evacuation of Allied personnel from Hook of Holland as German ground forces advanced through the Netherlands, suffering damage on 14 May during the operation. She then entered a dockyard in the United Kingdom for repairs. After completion of repairs, Wivern returned to service with her flotilla at Harwich in July 1940 to continue her convoy and patrol duties in the North Sea. On 11 July 1940 she was attacked by German aircraft off Suffolk while escorting Convoy FN 19 near Aldeburgh Light, but she avoided damage by manoeuvering. As the threat of a German invasion of the United Kingdom grew, her duties included anti-invasion patrols, and on 3 August 1940 Wivern, Wild Swan, the light cruiser , the destroyers and , and the patrol vessels , , and patrolled together. On 7 September 1940 Wivern and Wild Swan took part in Operation Rival, screening Cardiff and the light cruiser as they patrolled off the coast of the Netherlands. After Operation Rival, Wivern was transferred to Western Approaches Command with Wild Swan, the destroyer leader , and the destroyer to serve in the 5th Escort Group, based at Liverpool, for convoy escort work in the North Atlantic Ocean. She carried out these duties for the rest of 1940 without major incident. 1941 Wivern remained on convoy escort duty in the North Atlantic through the early weeks of 1941. On 26 February 1941, she deployed to escort ships of the 20th Destroyer Flotilla during Operation JH, a minelaying operation in the English Channel off Cape D'Antifer, France. She returned to her convoy duties after the conclusion of the operation. In May 1941, Wivern, Wild Swan, and the destroyer deployed to Portsmouth. On 12 May, Wivern, Wild Swan, and the escort destroyers and escorted the heavy cruiser , which was undergoing a refit, and was moved from Portsmouth to Rosyth, Scotland, to avoid German air raids. On 14 May Wivern and Wild Swan escorted the Free French Forces on the first leg of Surcoufs transatlantic voyage, separating from the submarine to return to the United Kingdom on reaching . On 17 May 1941 the Royal Navy assigned Wivern to escort the military convoy WS 8X from the Clyde to Freetown, Sierra Leone, and to remain at Freetown after arrival to conduct convoy escort operations from there, but after the sank the British battlecruiser in the Battle of the Denmark Strait on 24 May and broke out into the open Atlantic accompanied by the , the convoy's departure and Wiverns reassignment were postponed. Wivern instead was retained for duty in the Western Approaches pending developments related to the hunt for Bismarck and took passage with Vansittart and Wild Swan to Portsmouth to await further orders. Heavy units of the Home Fleet sank Bismarck in the North Atlantic on 27 May, and on 30 May the three destroyers returned to the Clyde. On 31 May, they set out from the Clyde as escorts for WS 8X along with the rest of the convoy's local escort, which also included the destroyers , , and , and the Royal Canadian Navy destroyer . On 3 June 1941, Wivern and the other ships of the local escort detached from WS 8X to return to the Clyde, leaving the convoy's protection to its ocean escort, which consisted of the aircraft carrier , the heavy cruiser , the light cruiser , and the armed merchant cruiser . On 18 June 1941, Wivern once again was assigned to convoy escort duty at Freetown along with Vansittart and Wild Swan, and the three destroyers steamed there that month to report for duty. From 10 to 13 July 1941, Wivern, Wild Swan, the destroyer , and the corvette reinforced the ocean escort - made up of the light cruiser and armed merchant cruiser - of the military convoy WS 9B during the final leg of its voyage to Freetown. On 3 August 1941, Wivern departed Freetown bound for Gibraltar, where she entered the Royal Navy Dockyard for a refit. Upon its completion in September 1941, she was based at Gibraltar for Atlantic convoy escort operations, which she continued for the rest of 1941 without major incident. 1942 Wivern remained on Atlantic convoy duty based at Gibraltar until 9 February 1942, when she departed Gibraltar with Wild Swan, the destroyers , , and , and the sloops , , , and as the escort of Convoy SL 100 for its voyage to Freetown. Upon arriving at Freetown, she continued convoy escort duty based there. In March 1942, the civil community of West Hartlepool in County Durham \\"adopted\\" Wivern in a Warship Week national savings campaign. On 3 May 1942, she departed Freetown with Boreas, the heavy cruiser , the light cruiser , the seaplane carrier , the escort destroyer , and the Royal Netherlands Navy destroyer as the escort for Convoy WS 18, detaching with Boreas on 4 May to return to Freetown. On 30 June 1942, Wivern, Boreas, and the destroyer joined Convoy WS 20 at sea to reinforce its escort - consisting of Brilliant, the destroyer , and the escort destroyer - and remained with the convoy until it arrived at Freetown on 2 July 1942. Wivern remained on escort duty at Freetown until October 1942, when she proceeded to Gibraltar with orders to support Operation Torch, the upcoming Allied amphibious landings in French Morocco and French Algeria scheduled for November 1942. In November, she began escorting convoys in the western Mediterranean, and on 10 November 1942 she was escorting Convoy TE 3 when she took part with Verity, the destroyer , and the corvettes and in a depth-charge attack on the in the Mediterranean off Oran, Algeria, after U-660 attacked the convoy; Lotus and Starwort were credited with sinking the submarine on 12 November 1942 at . Wivern continued on convoy escort duty based at Gibraltar through the end of 1942 and into 1943. 1943 Wivern was still based at Gibraltar on western Mediterranean convoy escort duty on 22 February 1943, when she came to the assistance of the Royal Canadian Navy corvette , which had struck a German mine and was sinking east of Gibraltar off Cape Espartel and was sinking at with the loss of her commanding officer and 12 other members of her crew. While rescuing Weyburns survivors, Wivern suffered severe structural damage either from the detonation of another mine or when depth charges aboard Weyburn exploded as she sank. In March 1943, Wivern was towed to the United Kingdom for repairs, and in April 1943 she was decommissioned at Plymouth and entered the Royal Navy Dockyard there for extensive repairs - including to her propulsion plant, which the explosion had lifted off its mountings - and a refit that included the replacement of her forward 4.7-inch (120-mm) with a twin 6-pounder British Army gun for use against motor torpedo boats. She was in dockyard hands for the next 20 months. 1944-1945 With her repairs and refit finally complete, Wivern underwent post-refit acceptance trials in September 1944 and recommissioned that month for assignment back to the Nore for service with the Harwich Escort Force. In October 1944, she took up her duties at Harwich, which were focused on nightly patrols to counter the operations of German motor torpedo boats - S-boats, known to the Allies as \\"E-boats\\" - in the North Sea. In November 1944, she began escort duty for North Sea convoys during their voyages between the Thames Estuary and Rosyth. In January 1945, Wivern was escorting a convoy when she suffered structural damage during a Force 12 gale. She underwent repairs at the Royal Navy Dockyard at Rosyth and returned to duty in February 1945. Wivern was part of the escort of Convoy FS 56 on its voyage from Rosyth to the Thames Estuary on 14 March 1945 when the attacked, torpedoing and sinking the Danish cargo ship Magne off St. Abbs, Scotland, near the Firth of Forth. As Wivern rescued Magnes survivors, the South African Navy frigate , a new ship that had left the River Tyne only four hours earlier bound for Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands and then for antisubmarine warfare training at Tobermory on the Isle of Mull, arrived on the scene to assist. Natal detected a submerged submarine with her ASDIC equipment, which was more modern and advanced than that on Wivern. Natal attacked, firing two Squid (weapon)Squid anti-submarine mortar salvos of six depth bombs each. After the second attack, Natal lost ASDIC contact with U-714 and oil and a metal tank rose to the surface at . Natal then proceeded to Scapa Flow. A Royal Navy antisubmarine hunter-killer group led by the frigate arrived and depth-charged the position, bringing more flotsam from the submarine to the surface. Wivern, however, claimed a share of the kill after depth-charging an oil slick to the south under the assumption that it was oil from U-714, which Wiverns crew believed had been only been damaged by Natal and was attempting to escape. Although some controversy surrounds credit for the sinking, naval authorities determined that Natal had sunk U-714 with the loss of the submarine's entire crew of 50 men and gave Natal sole credit. Wivern continued her convoy escort duties in the North Sea until the surrender of Germany in early May 1945. She then deployed to support Allied reoccupation forces in Norway and to transport Allied personnel. Decommissioning and disposal Wivern was decommissioned and laid up at Rosyth later in the summer of 1945, and by October 1945 she no longer appeared on the Royal Navys active list. Later placed on the disposal list, she was sold to Metal Industries on 18 February 1947 for scrapping. She was towed to the breaker's yard at Charlestown, Fife, Scotland, in October 1948.

The coronation riots of October 1714 were a series of riots in southern and western England in protest against the coronation of the first Hanoverian king of Britain, George I. Background Upon the death in August 1714 of the last Stuart monarch, Queen Anne, George Louis, Elector of Hanover, ascended the throne in accordance with the terms of the Act of Settlement 1701 that excluded Anne's half-brother James Francis Edward Stuart. After his arrival in Britain in September, George promptly dismissed the Tories from office and appointed a Whig-dominated government. Riots On 20 October, George was crowned at Westminster Abbey, but when his loyalists celebrated the coronation, they were disrupted by rioters in over twenty towns in the south and the west of England.Paul Kleber Monod, Jacobitism and the English People, 1688-1788 (Cambridge University Press, 1993), p. 173. The rioters were supporters of High Church and Sacheverellite notions. The Tory aristocrats and gentry absented themselves from the coronation and in some towns they arrived with their supporters to disrupt the Hanoverian proceedings.Monod, pp. 173-174. Thomas Gibson (1710) The celebrations of the coronation (balls, bonfires and drinking in taverns) were attacked by rioters who sacked their properties and assaulted the celebrants. Henry Sacheverell, who was on a 'progress' in the West Country, was mentioned by most of the rioters. At Bristol the crowd shouted, \\"Sacheverell and Ormond, and damn all foreigners!\\". In Taunton, they cried \\"Church and Dr. Sacheverell\\"; at Birmingham, \\"Kill the old Rogue [King George], Kill them all, Sacheverell for ever\\"; at Tewkesbury, \\"Sacheverell for ever, Down with the Roundheads\\"; at Shrewsbury, \\"High Church and Sacheverell for ever\\". In Dorchester and Nuneaton, Sacheverell's health was drunk.Monod, p. 174. The High Church inspiration behind the rioters was also expressed in their attacks on Dissenters. In Bristol, a Dissenting meeting place was looted, with the murder of a Quaker, who had tried to persuade the mob to stop. A Dissenting meeting-house in Dorchester was \\"insulted\\", and there many expressions for local Tories among the rioters; in Canterbury they shouted \\"Hardress and Lee\\"; in Norwich, \\"Bene and Berney\\"; in Reading, \\"No Hanover, No Cadogan, but Calvert and Clarges\\". Along with those expressions of disaffection to the Hanoverian king were also expressions of Jacobite sentiments, despite that being a treasonable practice, according to the law. In Taunton, a Francis Sherry said on 19 October that \\"on the morrow he must take up Arms against the King\\". The Birmingham rioter John Hargrave said they must \\"pull down this King and Sett up a King of our own\\". In Dorchester, the rioters attempted to rescue an effigy of James Stuart that was to be burnt by Dissenters and asked: \\"Who dares disowne the Pretender?\\" In Tewkesbury l, the bargemen wished to drink to Sacheverell and the King but were criticised for putting Sacheverell first. The crowd replied that \\"it should be the King if they would have it so\\" but when asked which king, James or George, they attacked by them shouting, \\"Sacheverell for ever, Down with the Roundheads\\".Monod, pp. 175-176.Nicholas Rogers, ‘Riot and Popular Jacobitism in Early Hanoverian England’, in Eveline Cruickshanks (ed.), Ideology and Conspiracy: Aspects of Jacobitism, 1689-1759 (Edinburgh: John Donald, 1982), p. 81. In Bedford, the maypole was put in mourning. It was a Jacobite symbol symbolising the 'vegetation god' motif of the Stuart monarchy and was associated with the connection between May day and Restoration Day.Monod, p. 176.Rogers, p. 75. The rule of the Puritans from 1649 to 1660 had outlawed the maypole, and it was not until the Restoration of 1660 that it was brought back: \\"Remarkably, this aspect of the Restoration was still remembered fifty years later, and was quickly adapted to imply that Hanoverian rule was no different from that of the ‘puritans’\\", according to Paul Monod. In Frome, Somerset, the rioters \\"dressed up an Idiot, called George, in a Fool's Coat, saying, Here's our George, where's --\\".Rogers, p. 71. The Anglican clergy mainly kept a low profile, but at Newton Abbot, the minister removed the bell- clappers so that the bells could not be rung in celebration of the coronation.Monod, p. 177. Aftermath The government did not trust local courts to prosecute the rioters and so tried to bring the rioters to London, but the scheme failed. Five rioters were brought to London from Taunton but were later released on bail. Seven Bristol rioters were to be tried by a Special Commission but it failed by prolonging the riot and was accompanied by an attack upon the Duke of Richmond at Chichester.Monod, p. 178. The rioters shouted at the judges: \\"No Jeffrey, no Western Assizes\\" and later: \\"A Cheverel, A Cheverel, and down with the Roundheads...up with the Cavaliers\\". A Tory merchant called William Hart (son of the Jacobite MP Richard Hart) was accused of being a ringleader of the rioters, but he escaped indictment. Other rioters were whipped, fined or imprisoned for three months.Monod, p. 179. The general election of 1715, which was also accompanied by riots, produced a Whig majority in the House of Commons. In response to the riots, the new Whig majority passed the Riot Act to put down such disturbances like. Eleven days after the riots, Sacheverell published an open letter: > The Dissenters & their Friends have foolishly Endeavour'd to raise a > Disturbance throughout the whole Kingdom by Trying in most Great Towns, on > the Coronation Day to Burn Me in Effigie, to Inodiate my Person & Cause with > the Populace: But if this Silly Stratagem has produc'd a quite Contrary > Effect, & turn's upon the First Authors, & aggressors, and the People have > Express'd their Resentment in any Culpable way, I hope it is not to be laid > to my Charge, whose Name... they make Use of as the Shibboleth of the > Party.Monod, pp. 177-178.

It was first published in 1722 making it first newspaper to be published in America. It was founded by Juan Ignacio María de Castorena Ursúa y Goyeneche, a journalist, Catholic priest, and later Bishop of Yucatan. He was evidently a Jesuit, as he was educated under Jesuit direction in the Colegial Real en el de San Ildefonso, and the Seminario de la Sagrada Compañía de Jesús de la Corte de México, and had many Jesuit associates. He is considered the first journalist in Latin America for having created the periodical in Mexico City, whose first issue was published on January 1, 1722. He was a friend of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, editing some of her works and defending her right to cultivate writing literature.  History of the Gaceta  In the eighteenth century a new form of periodical publication appeared: the gazette. Its objective was to provide information about Europe, the viceroyalty, arrival and departure of fleets and the publication of banns. The main gazettes were El Mercurio Volante, published by José Ignacio Bartolache, Diario Literario de México (Literary Journal of Mexico), Gaceta de Literatura de México and Asuntos Varios sobre ciencias y artes (Various Matters on Science and Arts), by José Antonio de Alzate y Ramírez.Cid Carmona Víctor Julian, \\"Epítome bibliográfico de impresos médicos mexicanos, siglos XVI-XVIII,\\" in Boletín Mexicano de Historia y Filosofía Médica, 2002; 5 (1) (in Spanish) The Gazeta de México y noticias de Nueva España - used the \\"z\\" in its spelling in respect for the Italian spelling, since Gaceta is a word that derives from that language. The publication consisted of eight pages per issue, and six numbers appeared under that name, until June 1722. From the fourth issue it was called Gazeta de México y florilegio historial de las noticias de Nueva España. Originally, the publication was conceived to record the events that occurred in the viceregal court. The objective of its editor was to report on the most notable and praiseworthy events of the day, in order to provide this information to the public. It was framed within the cultural and educational aims of the Bourbon dynasty, that is, it was intended to spread European ideas and customs among readers. The Gaceta de México was the first newspaper published in Latin America. In the North American continent Publick Occurrences preceded it, with its only issue published September 25, 1690, in Boston. Later, in the Spanish America colonies, other newspapers were begun, all following the example of the Gaceta de Madrid. They included the Gazeta de Guatemala (1729), the Gazeta de Lima (1743) ), the Gazeta de la Habana (1764), the Gaceta de Santa Fe de Bogotá (1785), and the Primicias de la cultura de Quito (1792). Mexico's first Gaceta de México publication suspended publication six months after its first issue. However, a few years later another newspaper with the same name emerged, which began its publication on January 1, 1728. This consisted of four pages per issue, and its editor was Juan Francisco Sahagún y Arévalo Ladrón de Guevara. It lasted until December 1739, publishing a total of 145 issues. There was a third Gaceta de México, a compendium of news from New Spain, which emerged on January 14, 1784, and suspended publication on January 2, 1810. It was edited by the Creole Manuel Antonio Valdés y Munguía, a printer and the owner of a company of rental coaches. This third version of the Gazette was the longest running newspaper in the Mexican colonial era.

This system is used to buffer most Internet communications that are extracted from fibre-optic cables, so these can be processed and searched at a later time.GCHQ report on the technical abilities of the powerful spying program TEMPORA, which allows for a \\"full take\\", released by Der Spiegel on 18 June 2014 It was tested since 2008 and became operational in late 2011. Tempora uses intercepts on the fibre- optic cables that serve as the backbone of the Internet to gain access to large amounts of Internet users' personal data, without any individual suspicion or targeting. The intercepts are placed in the United Kingdom and overseas, with the knowledge of companies owning either the cables or landing stations. The existence of Tempora was revealed by Edward Snowden, a former American intelligence contractor who leaked information about the program to former Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald in May 2013 as part of his revelations of government-sponsored mass surveillance programs. Documents Snowden acquired showed that data collected by the Tempora program is shared with the National Security Agency of the United States. Operation According to Edward Snowden, Tempora has two principal components called \\"Mastering the Internet\\" (MTI) and \\"Global Telecoms Exploitation\\" (GTE). He claimed that each is intended to collate online and telephone traffic. This contradicts two original documents, which say that Tempora is only for Internet traffic, just like the XKeyscore system of the NSA, components of which are incorporated in Tempora.Report on the NSA’s access to TEMPORA, Released by Der Spiegel on 18 June 2014. It is alleged that GCHQ produces larger amounts of metadata than NSA. By May 2012, 300 GCHQ analysts and 250 NSA analysts had been assigned to sort data. The Guardian claims that no distinction is made in the gathering of data between public citizens and targeted suspects. Tempora is said to include recordings of telephone calls, the content of email messages, Facebook entries and the personal Internet history of users. Snowden said of Tempora that \\"It's not just a U.S. problem. The U.K. has a huge dog in this fight...They [GCHQ] are worse than the U.S.\\" Claims exist that Tempora was possible only by way of secret agreements with commercial companies, described in Snowden's leaked documents as \\"intercept partners\\". Some companies are alleged to have been paid for their co- operation. Snowden also alleged that GCHQ staff were urged to disguise the origin of material in their reports for fear that the role of the companies as intercept partners would cause \\"high-level political fallout\\". The companies are forbidden to reveal the existence of warrants compelling them to allow GCHQ access to the cables. If the companies fail to comply they can be compelled to do so. Lawyers for GCHQ said it would be impossible to list the total number of people targeted by Tempora because \\"this would be an infinite list which we couldn't manage\\". GCHQ set up a three-year trial at the GCHQ Bude in Cornwall. GCHQ had probes attached to more than 201 Internet links by mid-2011; each probe carried 10 gigabits of data a second. NSA analysts were brought into the trials, and Tempora was launched in 2011, with data shared with the NSA. Ongoing technical work is expanding GCHQ's capacity to collect data from new super cables that carry data at 100 gigabits a second. The data is preserved for three days while metadata is kept for thirty days. TEMPORA comprises different components, like the actual access points to fibre-optic cables, a sanitisation program codenamed POKERFACE, the XKEYSCORE system developed by NSA, and a Massive Volume Reduction (MVR) capability. In May 2012, GCHQ had TEMPORA systems installed at the following locations: * 16 for 10 gigabit/second cables at the CPC processing centre * 7 for 10 gigabit/second cables at the OPC processing centre * 23 for 10 gigabit/second cables at the RPC1 processing centre Reactions UK Defence officials issued a confidential DA-Notice to the BBC and other media asking the media to refrain from running further stories related to surveillance leaks including US PRISM program and the British involvement therein. The US Army has restricted its employees' access to the Guardian website since the beginning of the NSA leaks of PRISM and Tempora \\"in order to prevent an unauthorized disclosure of classified information.\\" German Federal Minister of Justice Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger tweeted that she considered the program an \\"Alptraum\\" (\\"nightmare\\") and demanded that European Union institutions investigate the matter. Jan Philipp Albrecht, German Member of the European Parliament and spokesperson for Justice and Home Affairs of the Greens/EFA parliamentary group, called for an infringement procedure against the United Kingdom for having violated its obligations relating to the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data under Article 16 of the Treaties of the European Union.

Manufacture  Built for CPR, the hull, engine, boiler, and steel fittings of Naramata were pre-manufactured in Port Arthur, Ontario (now Thunder Bay) by Western Dry Dock and Shipbuilding Company, with final assembly taking place in Okanagan Landing. Construction began in September 1913 and was completed by the 20th of April in 1914. Upon completion, the total cost was and she was given her name in tribute to the beautiful village of Naramata, a town which at that time was responsible for producing a large portion of the valley's fruit supply. Crew The crew aboard Naramata consisted of 11-13 men: a captain or first officer, a pilot, two deckhands, a chief engineer, a second engineer, two firemen, one bargeman, and a cook who also served as a steward. The ship was the first on Okanagan Lake to have a flushing toilet and was equipped with a functioning shower. Due to the dirty nature of the job, crew members were required to shower at least once a week. Often, it was a joke that the crew members were considered to be some of the \\"cleanest and dirtiest\\" on the lake.  The role of SS Naramata  Naramata would occasionally carry passengers (maximum 22) up or down Okanagan Lake, but she was mainly employed as a tugboat for the Canadian Pacific Railway. CPR tugboats not only pushed and pulled barges filled with valuable goods, but in the winter months they would often work as icebreakers, clearing the way for other larger and often wooden-hulled passenger ships. Naramata would often run ahead of Sicamous with crew members leaving a cardboard trail as a way to mark the clear path. More commonly, however, was the barge service. CPR tugboats could push up to two barges at once, and with barges capable of holding up to ten railcars at one time this was no small feat. When transporting two barges, Naramata would be wedged between them from astern, resulting in a \\"V\\"-shape that allowed for easy maneuvering. Alternately, barges could also be pulled from behind the tugs.  Retirement  Naramata was retired in August 1967. After her retirement, she was kept at Okanagan Landing and passed through a variety of owners. = Restoration = In 1991, Naramata was sold to the Kettle Valley Railway Heritage Society and the City of Penticton. On October first of that same year, she was moved to Penticton where she remained afloat beside Sicamous until 1993. Upon discovering that the hull had begun to corrode, she was immediately beached in order to prevent sinking. she is sitting in a pool of water with hopes to beach her permanently next to Sicamous. In 2001, Naramata was purchased by the S.S. Sicamous Restoration Society, and by 2003 the Society had begun to clean and repaired the damaged ship. This included the removal of three tons of coal and asbestos, general carpentry and safety repairs, and the installation of a steel staircase to allow for easier public access. In 2004 a grant was awarded to the Society by the Western Economic Diversification Fund, a federal government program. This permitted further restoration of the ship and she received a deep cleaning and a fresh coat of paint. This was followed by the restoration of the pilothouse, some crew cabins, the replacement of numerous windows and the implementation of a security system.

The action began in March 2012 and finally concluded in June 2013, including a trial in September 2012 and an appeal in January 2013. Under Ontario law, politicians are required to disclose conflicts of interest and excuse themselves from votes at municipal government councils. Magder alleged that Ford had broken the Ontario law by voting at Toronto City Council on a motion of paying back money that Ford had raised for his private football foundation. The initial trial judge found Ford guilty and ordered removed by office, allowing the decision to be stayed and appealed. The appeal court found that Ford did violate the conflict of interest law, but the vote of Council itself was not in order, as demanding that Ford pay back the money was beyond the penalties allowed by Ontario law. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, but the Supreme Court chose not to listen to the appeal, allowing the appeals court judgment to stand and Ford remain mayor. If Ford had been removed, he would have been the first Toronto mayor removed from office. Ford is the only Toronto mayor who has been found in conflict of interest. The trial raised several issues related to the Ontario law of conflict-of-interest. The only penalty is removal from office. Another is that the law's disallowal of a person to speak on an issue directly affecting that person denies that person the right to speak in defence. Rob Ford Chronology In August 2010, the City of Toronto's Integrity Commissioner Janet Leiper ruled that Councillor Ford had not followed City Council's Code of Conduct and had abused his council position by using official letterhead and other council resources in fund-raising letters for his football foundation and had raised approximately $40,000 for the foundation. In the report, the commissioner had noted that donors had included lobbyists, clients of lobbyists and a corporation which did business with the City of Toronto., per Hackland, RSJ Ford had accepted $3,150 on behalf of the foundation from these donors. and the commissioner indicated that Ford should pay back this money. Ford indicated that he would challenge the report at Council, stating that he was being treated unfairly. He publicly asked \\"why the integrity commissioner doesn't investigate the $12,000 retirement party for Kyle Rae or the $6,000 French lessons for Adam Giambrone. Or better yet, why not that Tuggs deal, that 20-year lease behind closed doors. Why doesn't she investigate that?\\" On August 25, 2010, City Council debated the integrity commissioner's report. Ford participated in the report discussion and the vote after being warned by then-Council Speaker Sandra Bussin that he was in a potential conflict of interest. Council agreed with the commissioner and voted 26–10 for Ford to return the money. In the months following the meeting, Ford discussed the repayment with his donors. Several did not want repayment and Ford forwarded letters from several donors expressing their wishes to the integrity commissioner. By February 2012, Ford had not paid the amount and the matter was raised at a February 7, 2012 City Council meeting. Ford spoke and voted at the February 7 meeting: \\"[A]nd if it wasn't for this foundation, these kids would not have a chance. And then to ask for me to pay it out of my own pocket personally, there is just, there is no sense to this. The money is gone, the money has been spent on football equipment ...\\" City Council voted on a motion \\"[t]hat City Council rescind the previous decision made under Item CC52.1 and direct that no further action be taken on this matter\\", which carried by majority, 22 voting Yes, 12 No, with 11 absent. In March 2012, a complaint was filed by Paul Magder, a Torontonian, alleging that Ford's actions at the February 2012 Council meeting had violated the Ontario Municipal Conflict of Interest Act (MCIA). The lawsuit came to trial in Ontario Superior Court on September 5, 2012. The case was argued on Magder's behalf by Toronto civil rights lawyer Clayton Ruby, who represented him pro bono. Ruby argued that Ford had clearly violated the act by \\"having spoke to and voted on a matter in which he allegedly had a pecuniary interest ... contravening s. (5)1 of the MCIA and an order was sought under s. 10(1) of the MCIA declaring his seat on Toronto City Council vacant.\\" Ford's defense was that the MCIA did not apply to Toronto City Council's Code of Conduct; that the Council Resolution was ultra vires to Council's powers under the City of Toronto Act and therefore null; that the amount was insignificant, and that the contravention of the MCIA was committed through inadvertence or by reason of error in judgment. During the trial, Ruby argued Ford was \\"reckless\\" and \\"wilfully ignorant\\" of the law when he did not remove himself from the debate and vote. Ford testified he never read the MCIA or a City of Toronto councillor orientation handbook which included a section on conflicts of interest. Also, he did not attend City Council training sessions that covered conflicts of interest. The mayoralty oath of office includes a pledge to \\"disclose conflicts of interest\\", and when asked by Ruby if he understood the words, Ford said: \\"No. My interpretation of a conflict of interest, again, is it takes two parties and the city must benefit or a member of council must benefit.\\" Ruby argued that \\"as mayor he ought to have had a clear understanding of his obligations. This entire pattern of conduct shows that he chose to remain ignorant, and substituted his own view for that of the law.\\" Ford disagreed, stating he only acted in the best interest of high school students. The trial concluded on September 6 with no immediate judgment and the judge promised \\"to deliver the ruling in a timely fashion.\\" Ontario Superior Court Judge Hackland's ruling was released on November 26, 2012. Hackland found that Ford had violated the MCIA and declared his seat vacant, the decision to take effect in 14 days. In his decision, Hackland disagreed with all of Ford's legal arguments. In his disposition, Hackland stated: \\"Ford's actions were not done by reason of inadvertence or of a good faith error in judgment. I am, therefore, required by s. 10(1)(a) of the MCIA to declare the respondent's seat vacant. In view of the significant mitigating circumstances surrounding the respondent's actions ... I decline to impose any further disqualification from holding office beyond the current term.\\" Opinions differed on whether the ruling allowed Ford to run in a by-election should Council order one to fill the vacancy. According to the City Solicitor, the ruling disallowed Ford from holding office again until 2014, the next term of office. However, on November 30, Judge Hackland clarified his order, and did not bar Ford from running in a by-election, should one be held before 2014. After the ruling, Ford announced that he would appeal. \\"I'm a fighter. Sometimes you win some, sometimes you lose some. I've done lots of great work for the city ... This comes down to left-wing politics. The left-wing wants me out of here and they will do anything in their power to and I'm going to fight tooth and nail to hold onto my job and if they do for some reason get me out, then I'll be running right back at 'em soon as the next election is, if there's a by-election I'll have my name the first one on the ballot.\\" Ford was granted a stay of the decision on December 5, and remained mayor during his appeal. On January 27, 2013, the Superior Court upheld Ford's appeal. The judges declared that the original judge had erred because the financial judgment was not under the City of Toronto Act or the Council Code of Conduct. Further, the sanction was beyond the authority of the City Council to enact. Although Ford won the appeal, the appeals court disallowed Ford's claim for $116,000 in legal costs. Ruby filed an appeal of the decision to the Canadian Supreme Court, but the Court declined to hear the appeal. After the Supreme Court released its decision, Ford issued a statement: Issues arising from the trial In Hackland's own decision, he described the penalty of removal as \\"a very blunt instrument and [it] has attracted justified criticism and calls for legislative reform.\\" Hackland recommended \\"the existing sanctions in the Municipal Conflict of Interest Act (MCIA) remain in place. However, none should be mandatory, and lesser sanctions should be made available.\\" Professor David Mullan, Toronto’s former Integrity Commissioner, described it \\"it is simply Byzantine to have a regime under which the only way of dealing legally with conflict of interest in a municipal setting is by way of an elector making an application to a judge and where the principal and mandatory penalty (save in the case of inadvertence) is the sledgehammer of an order that the member’s office is vacated.\\" He recommended \\"that the City should make every endeavour to persuade the provincial government to either modernize the Municipal Conflict of Interest Act or confer on the City of Toronto authority to create its own conflict of interest regime in place of or supplementary to that Act.\\" See also *Crazy Town: The Rob Ford Story, 2014 biography by Robyn Doolittle *Timeline of Rob Ford video scandal References External links * Text of Magder vs. Ford decision * Text of Ontario Municipal Conflict of Interest Act * Text of Ontario Municipal Elections Act Category:Municipal government of Toronto Category:Ontario political scandals Category:Rob Ford ","title":"Rob Ford conflict of interest trial"},{"id":"39741136","text":"The Ministry of Ports and Aviation is Sri Lanka's organization responsible for the development and operation of the country's shipping, port and aviation activities.

N. gigantea is a tropical and sub-tropical species that establishes tubers in the muddy bottoms of still waters. Petals can be seen to be a light purple-blue when they first blossom. As they become mature plants they become a light blue, or can even be white.Due to its blue-white color, it is also known as “Blue Cloud\\", and typically flowers between the months June and July.  Description  The leaves of the N. gigantea are round and can grow out to 75 cm across and are sinuate and dentate. In botany, this means that their edges are toothed with pointed teeth, about 0.5 cm long. The apex of the lobes are rounded, however, the N. gigantea develop points in the space between the lobes from the rest of the leaf. The flowers are eminent, growing to about 25 cm across and stands 50 cm above the water. The leaves of N. gigantea lie on the water and are generally thick giving them a leathery feeling but are also brittle. The stigma is very dense with papillae, covering the dorsal surface of the carpels.  Distribution and Habitat  The seeds of N. gigantea are eaten by the Australians. In Australia, the tubers are collected and roasted by Aboriginal women. The buds and flower stalks are collected and eaten as well. N. gigantea was first introduced in England in1852. Three years later in 1855, Van Houtte fruited the species. Since 1865, N. gigantea has been observed to flower during the summer months in water because that is the optimum condition for the tubers to germinate.

Symbol of the SEC Office of the Whistleblower The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) whistleblower program went into effect on July 21, 2010, when the President signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The same law also established a whistleblower incentive program at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to incentivize reporting of violations of the Commodity Exchange Act, which is run by former senior SEC enforcement attorneyhttps://www.linkedin.com/pub/christopher- ehrman/5/b3b/ba Christopher C. Ehrman. The SEC Whistleblower Program rewards people who submit tips related to violations of the federal securities laws. The program offers robust employment protections, monetary awards and the ability to report anonymously. SEC whistleblowers are entitled to awards ranging from 10 to 30 percent of the monetary sanctions collected, which are paid from a replenishing Investor Protection Fund.https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/owb/reg-21f.pdf Since 2011, whistleblower tips have enabled the SEC to recover over $2 billion in financial penalties from wrongdoers. The SEC has awarded more than $500 million to whistleblowers. The largest SEC whistleblower awards to date are $50 million, $39 million, $37 million, $33 million and $30 million.https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/sp_faq/largest-sec-whistleblower-awards/ Overview While the SEC had in place a bounty program for more than 20 years to reward whistleblowers for insider trading tips and complaints, an Office of the Inspector General's 2013 report found that the SEC's old program received very few applications from individuals seeking a bounty, and there were very few payments made under the program, possibly because the program was not widely recognized. The report also determined the program was not well-designed. Following the financial crisis and the Madoff investment scandal, in July 2010, the SEC's bounty program was significantly enhanced after the President signed Dodd-Frank into law. Specifically, Section 922 of Dodd-Frank amended the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) by adding Section 21F, which created the SEC Whistleblower Program and the SEC Whistleblower Office.https://www.sec.gov/oig/reportspubs/511.pdf Under the new whistleblower program, the SEC is authorized to make monetary awards to whistleblowers who voluntarily provide original information that leads to successful enforcement actions resulting in monetary sanctions over $1,000,000. Under the program, a whistleblower may receive an award of between 10 and 30 percent of the monetary sanctions collected. Any violation of the federal securities laws may qualify for an award under the program, including, but not limited to, original information about accounting frauds,https://www.natlawreview.com/article/can-i-report-financial-fraud-and- receive-sec-whistleblower-award Ponzi schemes,https://www.natlawreview.com/article/how-to-report-ponzi-scheme-and- earn-sec-whistleblower-award and violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).https://www.natlawreview.com/article/sec-awards- disclosures-foreign-bribery-or-fcpa-violations The SEC's new whistleblower program represents a major benefit over other whistleblower reward programs that do not allow anonymous submissions, such as the IRS whistleblower program. Anonymous whistleblowers must sign a declaration in their complaint under the penalty of perjury \\"that the information contained herein is true, correct and complete to the best of my knowledge, information and belief.\\"Section F of the Form TCR, available at: https://www.sec.gov/files/formtcr.pdf Whistleblower's attorneys are responsible for the retaining the original, signed copy of the declaration.Section G of the Form TCR, available at: https://www.sec.gov/files/formtcr.pdf According to the 2017 Annual Report to Congress on the Dodd-Frank Whistleblower Program, a majority of tips received by the SEC related to corporate disclosures and financials (19 percent), offering fraud (18 percent), and manipulation (12 percent).https://www.sec.gov/files/sec-2017-annual-report-whistleblower- program.pdf The states that yielded the highest number of tips in Fiscal Year 2017 were California, New York, Texas, Florida, and New Jersey. The countries that yielded the highest number of tips in Fiscal Year 2017 were Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Since the inception of the program, the SEC has received whistleblower tips from 114 countries. = Notable awards = Since 2011, whistleblowers' tips have enabled the SEC to recover more than $1.4 billion in financial penalties from wrongdoers. Former SEC Chair Mary Jo White called the new SEC whistleblower program a \\"game changer,\\" in an April 2015 speech. \\"The program is a success – and we will work hard at the SEC to build on that success,\\" she said. Given that SEC investigations can take two to four years to complete, there were no awards made in the Program's first year of operation.https://www.sec.gov/files/whistleblower-annual-report-2011.pdf The first SEC whistleblower award was made on August 21, 2012 to a whistleblower who provided documents and information relating to an ongoing multimillion- dollar fraud. The whistleblower received $50,000, which represented 30 percent of the amount the Commission had collected at the end of the fiscal year. Four awards were made in Fiscal Year 2013, which totaled over $14 million.https://www.sec.gov/files/annual-report-2013.pdf In Fiscal Year 2014, the Commission issued awards to 9 whistleblowers, with actual payouts during the year approaching $2 million.https://www.sec.gov/files/owb-annual- report-2014_2.pdf In 2014, the SEC announced an award of more than $300,000–the first to an employee in an audit or compliance function–who filed a submission with the SEC after reporting internally and the company failed to take action. In Fiscal Year 2015, the Commission paid more than $37 million out of the Investor Protection Fund to eight whistleblowers.https://www.sec.gov/files/owb-annual-report-2015.pdf Among the awards, someone outside of the United States received more than $30 million, one of the largest award in the Program's history. Other precedent setting cases include the first award to a former company officer and the first award to a whistleblower who suffered retaliation for reporting possible securities violations to the SEC. Fiscal Year 2016 proved to be record-breaking, with the SEC awarding $57 million in whistleblower awards, more than the total paid in all years combined.https://www.sec.gov/files/owb-annual-report-2016.pdf Among the significant awards, a former company employee received an award of more than $17 million for a detailed tip that substantially advanced the agency's investigation and another insider received $22 million for extensive assistance that helped the agency halt a well-hidden fraud. The former Chief of the Office of the Whistleblower, Sean McKessy, once said he understood the public's skepticism about the program. \\"I view it as already having been a very significant success, but I understand that people want to see the deliverable. And the deliverable, in our view, is paying people for good information,\\" he said. He added that he welcomes the opportunity to make payouts: \\"The more, the better, obviously. The higher the amounts, the better,\\" he said. \\"We are likely to see more awards at a faster pace now that the program has been up and running and the tips we have gotten are leading to successful cases,\\" McKessy told the Wall Street Journal in June 2013. Sean McKessy left the agency in July 2016 after serving for five years and later joined a whistleblower law firm. He followed in the footsteps of Jordan A. Thomas, a former Assistant Director in the Enforcement Division, who had a leadership role in the development of the SEC Whistleblower Program. Thomas created a law firm specifically with the purpose of representing corporate whistleblowers in 2011. The SEC named Jane A. Norberg, the longtime Deputy Chief, Chief of the Office of the Whistleblower on September 28, 2016. = Appellate Court Challenges = On December 12, 2015 an anonymous party filed the first petition for a writ of mandamus in John Doe v. SEC.https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2647637/John-Doe-SEC- Whistleblower-Petition.pdf The motion is a rarely used motion that asks for intervention of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit into the SEC's alleged negligent dealing with the individual's claim. The motion claims that the SEC whistleblowers office had been negligent in a case originally posted as available for reward in 2012. The motion goes on to state that the anonymous petitioner applied for the reward in October 2012 and three years later there had been no preliminary determination made in the case USCA #15-1444.http://kmblegal.com/whistleblower-law-blog/sec-whistleblower-- program-delays-what-you-need-to-know The petition went into detailed facts about the backlog of the program, and was highly redacted. It was later rendered as moot when the SEC issued an award to the anonymous party. On December 5, 2017 the SEC program was again challenged by an anonymous party in John Doe V SEC (case number 16-1414) in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  Use of the Investor Protection Fund  =Establishment of the fund= The Investor Protection Fund was established in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 to be available to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, without further appropriation or fiscal year limitation for paying awards to whistleblowers and funding the work activities of Office of Inspector General’s employee suggestion program. The SEC is required to annually request and obtain apportionments from the Office of Management and Budget to use these funds. OFM has developed policies and procedures for Investor Protection Fund that include a description of the whistleblower awards process, financial reporting requirements, budget request procedures, and procedures for replenishing the Investor Protection Fund. The Investor Protection Fund was established in August 2010 with approximately $452 million of non-exchange revenue that was transferred to the fund from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's disgorgement and penalties deposit fund. At the end of fiscal year 2016, the fund had $368 million in it. If the Investor Protection Fund balance drops below $300 million, Enforcement will replenish it by identifying qualifying receipts for deposit. The fund earns interest through short-term investments with the Bureau of Public Debt. Whistleblower process =Phase 1 – Intake/triage= During Phase 1 of intake and triage, whistleblowers submit a complaint to the SEC. Designated Division of Enforcement staff review the complaint to determine whether it should be assigned for further investigation or based on their initial review no further action (NFA) is warranted. Whistleblowers can submit a complaint using SEC form TCR to the SEC. Online submissions are automatically uploaded into the SEC's Tips, Complaints, and Referrals system. Complaints received by mail and fax are manually entered into the TCR system by the Tips, Complaints, and Referrals intake group. The Office of Market Intelligence (OMI), located within Enforcement, reviews all Tips, Complaints, and Referrals and whistleblower complaints Enforcement receives. OMI triages all tips, complaints, and referrals received by Enforcement. When OMI determines a complaint warrants further investigation, the complaint is assigned to one of the SEC's 11 regional offices, an Enforcement specialized unit, or an Enforcement associate director group located in the SEC's Headquarters. When it is determined that a complaint does not warrant further investigation or the complaint does not fall into Enforcement's priorities, OMI will designate the complaint as No Further Action (NFA). NFAs get a second review before a final decision is made to close the complaint. In some cases NFAs may be referred to an external government agency or other agency for action. On occasion the Office of the Whistleblower Chief will determine that a whistleblower's tip, complaint, or referral is sufficiently specific, timely, and credible which results in it being expedited through the triage process and assigned to investigative staff by OMI. =Phase 2 – Tracking= During Phase 2, Office of the Whistleblower personnel monitor whistleblower submissions that are assigned to investigative staff. The Office of the Whistleblower also documents the whistleblower's cooperation and the content and helpfulness of whistleblower information, answers questions, and aids Enforcement staff by providing subject matter expertise regarding the whistleblower program. Furthermore, the Office of the Whistleblower documents information needed to process whistleblower awards. The office conducts quarterly conference calls with investigative staff to reconcile items that are tracked, with work that is assigned and resourced, and to discuss the quality of each whistleblower complaint. A whistleblower complaint results in a successful action against a defendant if the monetary sanctions: * Exceed $1 million. The whistleblower may then be eligible for a monetary award if all statutory criteria are met. * The whistleblower is not immediately eligible for a monetary award if the monetary sanctions do not exceed $1 million. However, if the case is aggregated with related SEC actions that arise out of a common body of operative facts and the total monetary sanctions in the related SEC actions collectively exceed $1 million, then the whistleblower may be eligible for an award. =Phase 3 – Claim for an award= During Phase 3, a whistleblower can claim an award if information he or she provided to the Office of the Whistleblower leads to, or significantly contributes to, a successful U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission action. This action could result in the whistleblower receiving a monetary award if the sanctions ordered are over $1 million. The Office of the Whistleblower posts a Notice of Covered Action on its website for cases that result in monetary sanctions over $1 million. Whistleblowers have 90 days to submit a claim for an award using the Form WB-APP (application). The Office of the Whistleblower's website provides a notice date and a claim due date for each covered whistleblower action. Whistleblowers receive their awards from the Securities and Exchange Commission Investor Protection Fund, established pursuant to Section 922 of the Dodd-Frank Act. When the Office of the Whistleblower or Enforcement staff knows that a whistleblower has provided a tip that led or significantly contributed to a successful action, they should contact the whistleblower or the attorney for the whistleblower and inform him or her that a Notice of Covered Action has been posted on its website. The Office of the Whistleblower should advise the whistleblower on the process and timeline to apply for the award. Office of the Whistleblower staff analyze the claims for awards to assess whether the whistleblower satisfied the eligibility and definitional requirements for an award. When a whistleblower is determined to have satisfied these criteria, the Office of the Whistleblower then uses four positive and three negative factors to derive a recommended award range between 10 and 30 percent of the dollar amount that was collected in the action. The Office of the Whistleblower process for its analyses includes reviewing and comparing the facts of a claim to the whistleblower statute and regulations, reviewing relevant databases for information regarding the case and subsequent enforcement action, interviewing Enforcement staff regarding the case and the whistleblower's actions, interviewing the whistleblower and/or their counsel, and conducting due diligence and legal research to ensure proper consideration is given to each award claim. In exercising its discretion to determine the award for SEC whistleblowers, the Commission will consider a variety of factors. Certain criteria may increase an award, such as the significance of the information provided by the whistleblower, the assistance provided by the whistleblower, the law enforcement interest in making an award and the participation of the whistleblower in internal reporting systems. Other factors may decrease an award, such as the culpability of the whistleblower, unreasonable reporting delay and interference with internal compliance and reporting systems. When making an award recommendation, the Office of the Whistleblower submits a recommendation package to Enforcement's claims review staff. A preliminary determination is prepared and forwarded to the whistleblower. A whistleblower has 30 days to request a copy of the record the claims review staff based its decision on and/or to request a meeting with Office of the Whistleblower staff. Should a whistleblower's claim be denied in the preliminary determination phase and the whistleblower fails to submit a timely response, the preliminary determination becomes the SEC's final order. If the whistleblower submits a timely response to appeal the preliminary determination decision, Office of the Whistleblower staff will assess the appeal and make a recommendation to the claims review staff. The Office of the Whistleblower then meets again with the claims review staff and the claims review staff makes a proposed final determination. The Office of the Whistleblower then notifies the Commission of the proposed final determination. The Commission has 30 days to review this determination. Any Commissioner can request within 30 days of receiving the proposed final determination notification, that the proposed final determination be reviewed by the Commission. If no Commissioner objects during the 30-day window, the proposed final determination becomes the final order and the Office of the Whistleblower then provides a copy of the final order to the whistleblower or the whistleblower's attorney. After the final order has been issued, if a whistleblower has gotten an award that falls between 10 and 30 percent of the monetary sanctions collected in the action, the process is complete and the amount is not subject to appeal. However, if the whistleblower did not receive an award, or the award percentage is outside the statutory 10 to 30 percent that is collected from an action, the whistleblower may appeal the decision at the Federal Court of Appeals level. The Office of the General Counsel handles these appeals for the Commission. Whistleblower awards are paid out of the Investor Protection Fund that was established in the Dodd-Frank Act. Payments from the IPF are made through the SEC's Office of Financial Management and are based on amounts that were collected from each individual case. A single payment can be made to the whistleblower if all monies are collected at the time the final order is issued, or the payment can occur on a rolling basis if the monies are collected over time, after the final order is issued. To file a claim for a whistleblower award, one must file Form WB-APP, Application for Award for Original Information Provided Pursuant to Section 21F of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. =Updating whistleblowers about the status of their applications= Below are the ways SEC Office of the Whistleblower communicates with whistleblowers after they submit an award application to the SEC: * An acknowledgement or deficiency letter is sent to all applicants indicating whether the whistleblower's application is procedurally correct. * An SEC Office of the Whistleblower attorney, who conducts a full review of a covered action, generally communicates with whistleblowers who have submitted award applications under a covered action. * A written notification of the claims review staff's preliminary determination and a whistleblower's rights in the awards claims process are sent to the applicant. * There's an opportunity for the whistleblower to request the record that was used by the claims review staff in making the preliminary determination. * There's an opportunity for the whistleblower to request a meeting with Office of the Whistleblower to discuss the preliminary determination. * If a claim is appealed to the claims review staff, (1) a written acknowledgment of receipt of appeal and (2) the results of the appeal (i.e., proposed final determination), will be sent to the whistleblower. * If the preliminary determination is not appealed to the claims review staff and no award is made, OWB sends a letter enclosing the final order of the Commission to the whistleblower. * Written notification of a proposed final determination being issued (whether pursuant to an appeal to the claims review staff or by virtue of the preliminary determination becoming a proposed final determination under the statute in the case of an award being recommended). * Notification of the Commission's final order. Office of the Inspector General Evaluation In the Office of the Inspector General Evaluation of the SEC's Whistleblower Program, January 18, 2013, the program was outlined by the Inspector General, providing some insight into its inner workings. Section 922 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank), amended the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) by adding Section 21F, \\"Securities Whistleblower Incentives and Protection.\\" Section 21F directs the SEC to make monetary awards to eligible individuals who voluntarily provide original information that leads to successful SEC enforcement actions resulting in the imposition of monetary sanctions over $1 million, and certain related successful actions. The SEC can make awards ranging from 10 to 30 percent of the monetary sanctions collected, which are paid from the SEC's Investor Protection Fund. In addition, Section 924(d) of Dodd-Frank directed the SEC to establish a separate office within the Commission to administer the whistleblower program. In February 2011, the Commission established the Office of the Whistleblower to carry out this function. On May 25, 2011, the SEC adopted final Regulation 21F to implement the provisions of Section 21F of the Exchange Act. Regulation 21F became effective on August 12, 2011. Among other things, Regulation 21F defines terms that are essential to the whistleblower's program operations, establishes procedures for submitting tips and applying for awards, including appeals of SEC determinations, and whether and to whom to make an award; describes the criteria the SEC will consider in making award decisions, and implements Dodd-Frank's prohibition against retaliation for whistleblowing. Freedom of Information Act exemption There are nine exemptions to the Freedom of Information Act, which the SEC and other federal agencies can use to deny the release of certain information which the public may request. Exemption 3, 5 U.S.C. Section 552(b)(3)(B) or (b)(3) pertains to information that is prohibited from disclosure by another federal law.

As the current chairman of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, a Moro regionalist and Islamist armed group in the southern Philippines, Ebrahim is a key figure in the Bangsamoro Peace Process in the Philippines. Early life and education Born on 15 May 1949, Murad Ebrahim was born to an Islamic preacher. He lost both of his parents at a young age; his mother when he was just one year old and his father when he was 13 years old. He is the youngest among four children. Ebrahim started his elementary studies when he was seven years old and completed the six-year program in five years. He entered the Cotabato Public High School in Cotabato City for his high school studies in 1960. After graduating from high school, Ebrahim enrolled at the Mindanao State University in Marawi under a scholarship but transferred to the Notre Dame University in Cotabato City in his second year after passing the entrance examination. He was granted a scholarship in Notre Dame by the Commission on National Integration (CIN) and pursued a course on civil engineering. However he stopped his studies in his fifth and final year in college in 1970 to get more involved in the Moro movement. Militant career =Moro National Liberation Front= Ebrahim dropped out of college to join the underground movement which fought against Christian paramilitary groups and security forces during the administration of then-President Ferdinand Marcos allegedly targeting Muslims. He adopted \\"Murad\\" as his nom de guerre when he joined the Moro resistance against the government. Ebrahim first got involved in the underground Moro secessionist movement as early as 1968 prior to fully committing in 1970. He was recruited into the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) in 1968 and was part of the \\"Top 300\\", a second batch of MNLF trainees sent to Malaysia. He was appointed as a zonal commander with his area of assignment covering 15 municipalities. Murad led the group's Kutawato Revolutionary Committee in fighting against government forces and the Ilaga paramilitary group in Central Mindanao. He was Military Chairman of Kutawato from 1974 until 1978 when he was promoted as Region Chairman. When Hashim Salamat organized a faction within the MNLF, Murad was appointed as Chairman of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Committee to lead the faction's activities in Mindanao, while Salamat is abroad. =Moro Islamic Liberation Front= Murad left the MNLF due to ideological differences along with Hashim Salamat who formed the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). In the 1980s, Murad went to Afghanistan to meet with Filipino rebels fighting against the forces of the Soviet Union amidst the Soviet–Afghan War though he said has not fought alongside them. There he also met Osama bin Laden, who would later become the head of Al-Qaeda describing him as a soft-spoken and refined man who would have never thought to be declared \\"a world enemy\\". He developed reputation within the MILF as one of its top guerrilla commanders. He served as Vice Chair for Military Affairs and as Chief of Staff of the Bangsamoro Islamic Armed Forces, the armed wing of the MILF before he was appointed as MILF chairman in mid-2003 to replace MILF founder Salamat who died within the same year. He also served as the group's chief negotiator in talks with the Philippine national government. Interim Chief Minister Ebrahim presiding the Bangsamoro Parliament as Chief Minister. Upon the passage into law of the Bangsamoro Organic Law in 2018 under the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte, he campaigned to get the legislation ratified by voters which would lead to the establishment of the proposed Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. He was nominated by his group, the MILF, to be the chief minister of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority which would serve as the interim government in the region. On February 22, 2019, He was appointed and sworn in by President Rodrigo Duterte as the interim Chief Minister of the newly formed Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). Murad will lead the 80-member Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA), which will govern its five-province Bangsamoro Region. Scheduled election of the new members for its Parliament will take place in 2022. The BARMM was a product of the government's negotiations with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) under the virtue of the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL). At the official turnover of the ARMM to BARMM on February 26, 2019, Murad announced the members of the first Bangsamoro Cabinet, with himself as concurrent Minister of Public Works and Highways. On November 11, 2019, Ebrahim transferred his duties as Public Works Minister to Finance Minister Eduard Guerra with the Chief Minister placing the finance ministry under his office's supervision. Personal life Murad is married to Hadja Lupia Ebrahim with whom he has two children. On 14 March 2015, controversy on the citizenship of Murad arose when Philippine former Interior Secretary Rafael Alunan accused him of being a citizen of Malaysia. This allegation was denied by Malaysia and Murad himself proved he does possess a Philippine passport.

Twelve aircraft were built between 1987 and 1990. Design and development In 1980, the Peruvian Air Force set up Peru's first aircraft manufacturer, Industria Aeronautica del Peru (Indero Peru), with the intent on building Aermacchi MB.339 jet trainers under licence.Gunston 2005, p. 235. High costs caused these plans to be abandoned, and it was eventually decided for the company to move into the General aviation field, negotiating licenses for production of the Aero Boero AB-115, AB-180 and the Pilatus PC-6, as well as a small two-seat lightplane based on popular kit aircraft such as the Denney Kitfox and Avid Flyer, the Indaer Peru Chuspi. Like the types upon it was based, the Chupsi (Mosquito) is a single-engine monoplane with a braced high wing. The fuselage is of welded steel tube construction with a fabric covering, while the wings are of mixed construction, the aluminium spars and plywood ribs. An enclosed cockpit accommodates two seats side-by-side and can be fitted with dual controls. It is powered by a single Rotax 532 piston engine driving a two-bladed fixed-pitch propeller. Either a tailwheel or nosewheel undercarriage can be fitted. The prototype made its maiden flight in August 1987, entering production in 1988. Aircraft could be fitted for crop spraying or sport purposes. A total of twelve aircraft were completed by January 1990.\\"Peru (Market Overview): Manufacturing Capability\\". September 2004.

Its purpose was to collect specimens for the Smithsonian's new Natural History museum, now known as the National Museum of Natural History. The expedition collected around 11,400 animal specimens which took Smithsonian naturalists eight years to catalog. Following the expedition, Roosevelt chronicled it in his book African Game Trails. Participants and resources The group was led by the legendary hunter-tracker R. J. Cunninghame.Brian Herne, White Hunters: The Golden Age of African Safaris (Henry Holt, 1999), pp. 8-9.Edmund Morris, Colonel Roosevelt (Random House, 2010), pp. 8-9. Participants on the Expedition included Australian sharpshooter Leslie Tarlton; three American naturalists, Edgar Alexander Mearns, a retired U.S. Army surgeon; Stanford University taxidermist Edmund Heller, and mammalologist John Alden Loring; and Roosevelt's 19-year-old son Kermit, on a leave of absence from Harvard.Edmund Morris, Colonel Roosevelt (Random House, 2010), p. 9. The expedition also included a large number of porters and \\"porters, gunbearers, horse boys, tent men, and askari guards.\\"Edmund Morris, Colonel Roosevelt (Random House, 2010), p. 8.

Roosevelt brought a M1903 Springfield in .30-06 caliber and, for larger game, a Winchester 1895 rifle in .405 Winchester.Dan Aadland, In Trace of TR: A Montana Hunter's Journey (University of Nebraska Press, 2010), pp. 64-65. Roosevelt also brought his Pigskin Library, a collection of classics bound in pig leather and transported in a single reinforced trunk.Darrin Lunde, The Naturalist: Theodore Roosevelt, a Lifetime of Exploration, and the Triumph of American Natural History (Broadway, 2016), p. 194. Timeline and route  Map of the route taken by the party. From the Edmund Heller Papers, 253x253pxThe party set sail from New York City on the steamer Hamburg on March 23, 1909, shortly after the end of Roosevelt's presidency on March 4. The Hamburg arrived at its destination at Naples, where the party boarded the Admiral, a German-flagged ship selected because it permitted the expedition to load large quantities of ammunition.Darrin Lunde, The Naturalist: Theodore Roosevelt, a Lifetime of Exploration, and the Triumph of American Natural History (Broadway, 2016), p. 195. While on board the Hamburg, Roosevelt encountered Frederick Courteney Selous, a longtime friend who was traveling to his own African safari, traversing many of the same areas.Darrin Lunde, The Naturalist: Theodore Roosevelt, a Lifetime of Exploration, and the Triumph of American Natural History (Broadway, 2016), pp. 195-96. The party landed in Mombasa, British East Africa (now Kenya), traveled to the Belgian Congo (now Democratic Republic of the Congo) before following the Nile to Khartoum in modern Sudan. Financed by Andrew Carnegie and by his own proposed writings, Roosevelt's party hunted for specimens for the Smithsonian Institution and for the American Museum of Natural History in New York. Results Roosevelt and his companions killed or trapped approximately 11,397 animals. According to Theodore Roosevelt’s own tally, the figure included about four thousand birds, two thousand reptiles and amphibians, five hundred fish, and 4,897 mammals (other sources put this figure at 5,103). Add to this marine, land and freshwater shells, crabs, beetles and other invertebrates, not to mention several thousand plants, and the number of natural history specimens totals 23,151. A separate collection was made of ethnographic objects. The material took eight years to catalogue. The larger animals shot by Theodore and Kermit Roosevelt are listed on pages 457 to 459 of his book African Game Trails. The total is 512, of which 43 are birds. The number of big game animals killed, was 17 lion, 3 leopard, 7 cheetah, 9 hyena, 11 elephant, 10 buffalo, 11 (now very rare) black rhino and 9 White rhino. Most of the 469 larger non big game mammals included 37 species and subspecies of antelopes. The expedition consumed 262 of the animals which were required to provide fresh meat for the large number of porters employed to service the expedition. Tons of salted animals and their skins were shipped to Washington, D.C.; the quantity took years to mount, and the Smithsonian shared many duplicate animals with other museums. Regarding the large number of animals taken, Roosevelt said, \\"I can be condemned only if the existence of the National Museum, the American Museum of Natural History, and all similar zoological institutions are to be condemned.\\"O'Toole, Patricia (2005) When Trumpets Call, p. 67, Simon and Schuster, Some context when considering whether the quantity of animals taken was excessive is that the animals were gathered over a period of ten months and were procured over an area that ranged from Mombasa through Kenya, to Uganda and the Southern Sudan—a distance traveled, with side trips, of several thousand kilometers. The diversity of larger mammal species collected was such that few individuals of any species were shot in any given area, and the large mammals collected had a negligible impact on the great herds of game that roamed East Africa at that time. Apologists for the Roosevelts have pointed out that the number of each big game species shot was very modest by the standards of the time: many white hunters of that period, for example, such as Karamoja Bell, had killed over 1,000 elephants each, while the Roosevelts between them killed just eleven. In making this comparison it has to be remembered that the white hunters weren’t collecting specimens for museums, but were occasionally employed by landowners to clear animals from land they wanted to use for plantations, and frecuently as ivory hunter with or without hunting permit or licenses. Although the safari was conducted in the name of science, it was as much a political and social event as it was a hunting excursion; Roosevelt interacted with renowned professional hunters and land-owning families, and met many native peoples and local leaders. Roosevelt became a Life Member of the National Rifle Association, while President, in 1907 after paying a $25 fee. He later wrote a detailed account in the book African Game Trails, where he describes the excitement of the chase, the people he met, and the flora and fauna he collected in the name of science. While Theodore Roosevelt greatly enjoyed hunting, he was also an avid conservationist. In African Game Trails he condemns \\"game butchery as objectionable as any form of wanton cruelty and barbarity\\" (although he does note that \\"to protest against all hunting of game is a sign of softness of head, not of soundness of heart\\") and as a pioneer of wilderness conservation in the USA he fully supported the British Government's attempts at that time to set aside wilderness areas as game reserves, some of the first on the African continent. He notes (page 17) that \\"in the creation of the great game reserve through which the Uganda railway runs the British Government has conferred a boon upon mankind\\", a conservation attitude which Roosevelt helped sow that finally grew and blossomed in the form of the great game parks of East Africa today.

Areas along the Bow, Elbow, Highwood, Red Deer, Sheep, Little Bow, and South Saskatchewan rivers and their tributaries were particularly affected. A total of 32 states of local emergency were declared and 28 emergency operations centres were activated as water levels rose and numerous communities were placed under evacuation orders. Five people were confirmed dead as a direct result of the flooding and over 100,000 people were displaced throughout the region. Some 2,200 Canadian Forces (CF) troops were deployed to help in flooded areas in addition to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Alberta Sheriffs Branch response. Total damage estimates exceeded C$5 billion and in terms of insurable damages, made the 2013 Alberta floods the costliest disaster in Canadian history at $1.7 billion, until the occurrence of the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire. Receding waters gave way to a mammoth cleanup of affected areas, aided by a spontaneous volunteer campaign in which many home owners were assisted by complete strangers. Meteorology Accumulated precipitation contours showing the June 19–22, 2013 rainfall event within Alberta's Rockies and the foothills that triggered the flooding Situated east of the Canadian Rockies, southern Alberta is a semi-arid region that does not usually receive high amounts of rainfall. A high-pressure system in northern Alberta blocked the passage to a low- pressure area to the south, 19-21 June. This blocked circulation and easterly winds pumped humidity on the rising slopes of the Rocky Mountains foothills, causing heavy rain into the province with rainfall amounts of over to fall in less than two days in many regions of the province, particularly west and southwest of Calgary. In Canmore, a town in Alberta's Rockies, over fell in just 36 hours, nearly half of the town's annual average rainfall. In the town of High River, rainfall amounts at one weather station recorded 325 millimeters (12.8 in) in less than 48 hours. The rain falling on already saturated ground, coupled with the steep watershed and heavy snow loads remaining in the front ranges of the Rocky Mountains, resulted in a rapid increase in the size and flow of several rivers. At the peak of the flooding, the Bow and Elbow rivers were flowing through Calgary at three times their peak levels from a 2005 flood that caused C$400 million in damages. Within 48 hours, by 8 a.m. MDT on June 21, the flow rate on the Bow River had reached 1,458 cubic metres (51,489 cubic ft.) per second (m3/s), five times its normal rate for this time of the year. The Elbow and Highwood rivers reached flow rates of 544 m3/s (inside Calgary) and 734 m3/s respectively, ten times their averages for this time of year. According to data tracked by Alberta's Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Resource Development,This June 18, 2013, story covered concerns about the typical \\"low flow in Alberta s rivers, particularly the Old Man, Bow and Red Deer rivers during the summer.\\"Premier Redford created the Environment and Sustainable Resource Development (ESRB) formerly known as the Ministry of Environment and Water on May 8, 2012. \\"in the space of a day or two, the flows of the three rivers rocketed up five to 10 times their normal rates.\\" Impact A total of 32 local governments in southern and central Alberta declared states of local emergency as a result of the flooding. Government officials called the flooding the worst in Alberta's history. By June 24, 2013, some 2,200 Canadian Forces (CF) troops had been deployed to help in flooded areas. Land Force Western Area brought in Coyote reconnaissance vehicles, Bison armoured vehicles, G-Wagen Jeeps, and other military vehicles. As communities began to flood and people became displaced, area residents mobilized to offer support and assistance to evacuees and emergency response personnel. Some volunteers and several police officers worked up to 20 hours to help evacuation efforts despite knowing their own homes had been damaged or completely washed away. While coverage of the flooding spread throughout social media sites, many people and businesses also took to Facebook and Twitter to open their homes up to neighbours and strangers who did not have other places to stay or offer whatever support they could. =Calgary= The flooded Glenmore Reservoir in Calgary, on June 21, 2013 In Calgary, Alberta's largest city, 26 neighbourhoodsAffected neighbourhoods included Beltline, Bonnybrook, Bowness, Bridgeland Industrial Area, Chinatown/Eau Claire, Cliff Bungalow, Deer Run, Discovery Ridge, Douglasdale, Downtown/East Village, Elbow Park, Erlton, Inglewood, Hillhurst, Mission, Montgomery, Quarry Park, Rideau Park, Riverbend, Riverdale, Roxboro, Stanley Park/Elboya, Sunnyside, Victoria Park, Westmount and Windsor Park in the vicinity of the Bow and Elbow rivers were placed under a mandatory evacuation order on June 20 and 21 as the rivers spilled over their banks and flooded communities. Affecting 75,000 people, it was the largest evacuation order in the city's history. The city's downtown core was among the areas evacuated, as officials called for a \\"Neighbour Day\\" on June 21 and requested people to stay home, particularly the 350,000 people who work downtown. All schools in both the public and Catholic school districts were closed and officials urged residents to avoid unnecessary travel. On June 21, the Bow River had reached a record high water level of . That same day, the river also reached a record high flow rate of .https://wateroffice.ec.gc.ca/report/historical_e.html?stn=05BH004&mode;=Table&type;=h2oArc&results;_type=historical&dataType;=Daily&parameterType;=Flow&year;=2013&y1Max;=1&y1Min;=1 Through social media,A highly detailed Google Map was updated to include neighbourhoods under mandatory evacuation and to show information such as the hydrology of the Bow and Elbow River systems. websites and blogsThe City of Calgary constantly updated their blog. with a constant stream of updated contributions from the Calgary's mayor,Mayor Nenshi is well-known for his effective use of social media. numerous city councillors,The City of Calgary's Facebook account was also widely used. the Calgary Police, media at all levels, and numerous Calgarians with Twitter,Twitter hashtags included #yycflood, #abflood. Flickr and Facebook accounts, the flood was extremely well-covered.Calgary neighbourhoods underwater as Bow River's rise continue Alberta floods prompt widespread downtown Calgary evacuationsWhile the Calgary Police's Twitter account was locked when it reached its daily limit, this was temporary and there were numerous other options. The city's largest indoor arena, the Scotiabank Saddledome, was among the facilities damaged as flood waters were reported to have filled up to the first ten rows of the lower seating bowl. The Calgary Stampede grounds adjacent to the arena were also severely flooded, less than two weeks before the scheduled opening of the annual exhibition and rodeo, however officials vowed the event would go on. The Calgary Highlanders assisting city workers in flood relief in the community of Inglewood (June 22, 2013) While emergency officials began to announce the partial lifting of some evacuation orders on June 22, Mayor Naheed Nenshi stated that it would be several days before power could be restored to the downtown core. City workers, assisted by Canadian Forces personnel from The Calgary Highlanders, reinforced a particularly large erosion of river bank near 8th Avenue S.E., which endangered several houses in the neighbourhood of Inglewood. Calgary's central business district, home to many of Canada's oil company headquarters, remained inaccessible until June 26. A spokesman for Imperial Oil, Canada's second-largest producer and refiner, said the company was working on plans to maintain essential operations, including allowing employees to work from other locations. Shorcan Energy Brokers, which provides live prices for many Canadian crude grades, operated out of Toronto on June 21 rather than at its usual Calgary base, although no trades in either Western Canada Select heavy blend or light synthetic crude from the oil sands were executed. Net Energy Inc, the other main Calgary crude broker, was closed on Friday, June 21, and there was no trading. As the water began to recede, the city lifted evacuation orders for several communities. It allowed 65,000 residents to return to their homes and business on June 23 to assess for damage, but parts of 14 communities remained off-limits. On June 27, the Bonnybrook Bridge collapsed under the weight of a Canadian Pacific Railway freight train. One of the pilings of the 101-year-old rail bridge had been scoured by floodwaters on the Bow River and undermined. CPR officials said that because the scour occurred underwater, they had not been able to inspect it, due to river conditions. However, rail regulations require the ability to inspect underwater. The buckled bridge caused the train to derail. As the train was carrying hazardous petrochemicals, an evacuation was ordered for the local area and regions downstream, and the train was slowly pumped dry. =High River= Damaged rail tracks in High River Abandoned homes - due to 2013 flood - in High River, Alberta ( 1600 Macleod Trail ) - slated to be moved. South of Calgary, the town of High River was evacuated after flooding of the Highwood River caused water to rise over the top of vehicles in the town's main streets and necessitated the rescue of over 150 people from the rooftops of their homes. 350 Canadian Forces personnel and 80 Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers were dispatched to assist with rescue efforts. Members of the Alberta Sheriffs Branch were also involved in this effort. All 13,000 residents of High River were ordered to evacuate on June 20, and the community was largely abandoned within three days as the town suffered what local officials called \\"unprecedented\\" damage. Among internationally recognized sites flooded in High River was the \\"Maggie's Diner\\" standing set for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) series Heartland. During the state of emergency in High River, the RCMP entered numerous homes in the area and seized hundreds of firearms, along with magazines and ammunition. Although the RCMP claimed that it only seized firearms that were in plain view, many residents have complained that their firearms were well hidden, and that the RCMP caused significant damage inside homes while searching for firearms. There are further complaints that RCMP members subjected homes to second or even third searches in their quest for firearms in plain view. The Commission for Public Complaints Against the RCMP concluded that the RCMP had exceeded its authority by seizing firearms that were properly secured or not in plain view, by not keeping proper records of the damage caused when they broke into homes, and by failing to report the seizure of firearms to a justice of the peace. The report concluded that, although they were not legally required to do so, communicating adequately with the public during the crisis would have prevented much confusion among partners and anger among residents. While residents of other communities were returning and beginning their cleanup, High River remained off limits a week after the flooding first hit. Residents grew increasingly frustrated at what they perceived as a lack of communication from local officials, particularly the lack of a timeline to return. Officials argued the town remained unsafe; some residences remained accessible only to divers, while E. coli had been discovered in the water. The neighborhood of Beechwood estates, with many luxury homes worth over a million dollars, was among those hard hit by the flood. The Province of Alberta decided to purchase the 94 homes, demolish most of them and return the area to its natural state as a floodplain. Twenty-six of the houses were auctioned off for relocation. =Southern Alberta= Bassano Dam on June 23, 2013 Bassano Dam on Dec 8, 2016 for comparison, during construction of the new emergency spillway The mountain towns of Banff and Canmore, west of Calgary, were cut off from neighbouring communities after flooding and mudslides forced the closure of the Trans-Canada Highway. Several homes were swept away in Canmore by the rise of Cougar Creek. In addition to Calgary, High River and Canmore, nine other municipalities, including the City of Lethbridge; the towns of Black Diamond, Cochrane, Sundre and Turner Valley; the Municipality of Crowsnest Pass; Rocky View County; and the municipal districts of Bighorn No. 8, Pincher Creek No. 9 and Foothills No. 31, had declared states of emergency on June 20 due to flooding and some communities had evacuated residents. Additionally, the City of Red Deer declared a state of emergency over the potential of flooding ahead of a planned release of water from the Dickson Dam into the Red Deer River. Another dozen communities have declared a state of emergency on June 21, including several First Nation reserves; the Siksika First Nation, east of Calgary evacuated 1,000 residents. The city of Medicine Hat, located on the South Saskatchewan River downstream from the confluence of the Bow and Oldman rivers was also hit with significant flooding. The city evacuated 10,000 residents ahead of the flooding, and facilities including the Medicine Hat Arena had begun to flood late Sunday evening, June 23. The South Saskatchewan River peaked at 5,460m3/s, which was below earlier predictions of 6,000m3/s, but exceeded the highest recorded rate of 5,100m3/s in 1995. =Saskatchewan and Manitoba= Officials in the neighbouring provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba were bracing for potential flooding along the South Saskatchewan and Saskatchewan rivers, into which many of the affected rivers in Alberta drain. The South Saskatchewan River reached record levels through Saskatoon, but the city did not experience significant flooding. 2,200 people were evacuated from the Cumberland House area in eastern Saskatchewan. In Manitoba, flood warnings were issued for The Pas. Fatalities Four people are confirmed to have died as direct result of the flooding. Three people drowned in the Highwood River near High River, while an elderly woman drowned in her ground-floor apartment in Calgary's Mission neighbourhood. Additionally, Okotoks resident Robert David Nelson was killed in an ATV rollover while checking a neighbour's home for flood damage. Cleanup and recovery Flooding of the Scotiabank Saddledome was extensive, however the Calgary Flames were able to repair the arena in time for the start of the 2013–14 NHL season. =Estimated costs= On June 24, 2013 although total damage caused by the flooding remained unknown, Alberta Premier Alison Redford, predicted it would surpass the $700 million caused by the Slave Lake fire, with much of the cost likely to be uninsurable. In a report issued on June 24, 2013, Tom MacKinnon, BMO Capital Markets insurance analyst, suggested an early estimate of between $3 billion and $5 billion of total damages to \\"homes, businesses, vehicles and other private property.\\" That would be \\"20 to 30 times\\" the amount of damage caused by southern Alberta's 2005 major flood, and the second costliest natural disaster in Canadian history. The Province of Alberta estimated in August that the cost of repairing the damage would exceed $5 billion. The Insurance Bureau of Canada stated in September that insurable losses had exceeded $1.7 billion, making it the costliest disaster in Canadian history in terms of insured damages (and without accounting for inflation), surpassing the $1.6 billion cost of the North American Ice Storm of 1998. The bureau called the cost \\"staggering\\", and said the figure continued to rise. The Albertan government granted the Siksika nation $93M to rebuild their communities; $10M of this grant will be used to train and upgrade the vocational skills needed to perform construction repairs.Gandia, Renato. 'Province to pay $93M to repair Siksika' . December 6, 2013. Calgary Sun. Retrieved December 6, 2013 =Municipal level= Alberta's Minister of Municipal Affairs, Doug Griffiths, announced that a task force that represents numerous government agencies and which earned praise for its coordination of recovery efforts following the 2011 Slave Lake wildfire would be reconvened. John McGowan, CEO of the Alberta Urban Municipalities Association (AUMA) described how AMSC is applying what they learned from the $700-million clean- up process following the Slave Lake fire in 2011 in their response to the flood. McGowan explained how the AUMA's subsidiary Alberta Municipal Services Corporation (AMSC) will provide a wide variety of services which include general insurance to the approximately 278 cities, towns and villages in Alberta affected by the flood. Damaged public buildings, vehicles and key public infrastructure, including subsidiary damage such as, structural damage to bridges or tunnels, need to be repaired or replaced in the \\"biggest cleanup in provincial history\\". \\"Neighbours, strangers, friends, and friends-of- friends-of-friends\\" helped those whose homes were damaged in Calgary's flood. Calgary's first official call, early on the morning of June 24, for 600 volunteers resulted in an estimated 2,500 people arriving ready to work. Calgary Emergency Management Agency director Bruce Burrell said that the City of Calgary hired contractors on larger infrastructure repairs but volunteers were needed. =Provincial level= Upon touring the affected areas, Alberta Premier Alison Redford who represents the Calgary-Elbow riding, promised provincial assistance in recovery efforts. The Alberta Treasury board met early on June 24 to approve a preliminary $1 billion emergency fund for the disaster recovery program, covering immediate clean-up and repair costs. Losses to home owners and municipalities caused by overland flooding, not covered by regular insurance, will be covered by the province. While making the funding announcement Premier Redford cautioned that it could take up to ten years to fully recover from the disaster. =Federal level= Prince William and his wife sent on June 24, via the Canadian Secretary to the Queen, a message of support, expressing their \\"best wishes to the Lieutenant Governor and Premier of Alberta and to the brave emergency services and all those volunteering to help their neighbours during this on-going period of intense efforts.\\" His father, Prince Charles also, following the destruction of Lac- Mégantic, Quebec, on July 8, issued a statement mentioning both that disaster and the Alberta floods, saying \\"this has been a most testing time for Canadians\\" and praising the \\"extraordinary efforts which have led to the Calgary Stampede being opened on time\\" as demonstration that \\"it is only too clear how courageous and resourceful Canadians are and we have nothing but the greatest admiration for such determination and resilience in the face of terrible adversity.\\" Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who also represents the Calgary Southwest riding, toured the flooded area and promised federal assistance in recovery efforts. Harper, Redford and Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi took a helicopter tour of flood-damaged areas on the afternoon of June 21, and discussed the trilateral co-operation to the flood response. It was announced in 2013 that $2 billion was earmarked from the government's Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements for the province and that the government was seeking a $689-million increase in funding for the program from parliament. =First Nations= Washed out bridge that spanned the Bow River within the Siksika Nation, photo taken from the blocked and guarded side of the bridge accessible only to Samaritan Purse volunteers (June 9, 2013) A state of emergency for Siksika First Nation, east of Calgary, was declared in the evening of June 20 with approximately one thousand people evacuated from their homes. By June 23, with 200 homes still underwater, Chief Fred Rabbitcarrier told CTV that there was a \\"feeling of hopelessness.\\" However, as news outlets began to cover the story and a Facebook account, set-up using a cellphone, helped coordinate relief efforts, donations and volunteers have responded to the community's call for help. =Volunteering= Soon after the flood started to recede, volunteer efforts began to help clean up the aftermath of the flood in Calgary. Thousands of people descended on heavily hit areas to help neighbours and strangers clean up in the aftermath. Buses were organized to transport volunteers into High River, where the majority of residents were expected to require assistance. =Flood mitigation= In November 2013, the Government of Alberta announced various projects to mitigate future flooding within Calgary and High River. The projects include construction of a channel to divert water around High River and a dry dam for the Elbow River west of Bragg Creek, which is upstream of Calgary. A grant was also announced for Calgary to investigate construction of a tunnel to divert Elbow River flood waters away from neighbourhoods.Cryderman, Kelly.'Alberta begins planning mitigation projects in wake of disaster'.

Opened in 1859 by the Banff, Portsoy and Strathisla Railway, it was absorbed by the Great North of Scotland Railway in 1867. The original terminus closed in 1884 and a new station opened nearby on a through route and two years later, after the Moray Firth coast line opened, the station was served by Aberdeen to Elgin trains. The Great North of Scotland Railway was absorbed by the London and North Eastern Railway in 1923 and became part of British Railways when the railways were nationalised in 1948. The station was recommended for closure by Dr Beeching's report \\"The Reshaping of British Railways\\" and closed on 6 May 1968. History =Banff, Portsoy and Strathisla= The Banff, Portsoy and Strathisla Railway opened on 30 July 1859, with a line from Banff to Grange, on the Great North of Scotland Railway (GNoSR) main line, with a branch from Tillynaught to Portsoy. Beyond the Portsoy passenger terminus was a steeply graded line, at 1 in 30, to the harbour, restricted to a locomotive and four wagons. The GNoSR took over services on 1 February 1863, and the railway renamed the Banffshire Railway. An extension to Portgordon was authorised, but this was abandoned in 1867 and the Banffshire absorbed by the GNoSR. =Moray Coast Line= 1904 OS map of Portsoy showing harbour branch (in green), and the two stations The extension to Portgordon was revived and extended along the Moray Firth coast to Elgin. A new station was built at Portsoy for this through line, which opened, together with a extension to Tochieneal, on 1 April 1884. The Countess of Seafield had not allowed a direct route to be built through Cullen House policies so a massive viaduct was built over the town. The former passenger station was kept for goods. After the Moray Coast Line opened on 1 May 1886, through Aberdeen to Elgin services called at the station. The harbour branch was little used after the opening of the Coast Line and the tracks lifted in 1910. In the 1921 Grouping, the Great North of Scotland Railway was absorbed by the London and North Eastern Railway. This was nationalised in 1948, and services provided by British Railways. The station and line was recommended for closure by Dr Beeching's in his report \\"The Reshaping of British Railways\\" closed on 6 May 1968. The station was host to a LNER camping coach from 1935 to 1939 and possibly one for some of 1934. A camping coach was also positioned here by the Scottish Region from 1952 to 1960. =Portsoy Scout Hut= The 1884 station, a weatherboarded, gabled, single storey building, double cruciform in plan, survived the closure of the railway and is now used as a Scout hall. It is a Category C listed building. Between 2011 and 2016, it was one of five buildings to be renovated as part of the Portsoy Conservation Area Regeneration Scheme, which was funded by Historic Scotland. Services After the GNoSR took over services, Portsoy had six trains a day to Tillynaught, three reversing to continue to Banff. Initially the branch services were extended to Tochieneal when the line reached there, and in 1886, after the Coast Line was complete, the station was served by four through trains a day between Aberdeen to Elgin. The speed of trains increased, so that in 1896 Locomotive Magazine was able to record a run from Aberdeen to Elgin that completed the in hours. In summer 1948, Portsoy was served by four Aberdeen to Inverness trains, with Portsoy about 2 hours from Aberdeen. There was also a mid-day Keith Town to Inverness service and an evening service from Aberdeen that terminated at Elgin. There were three services from Inverness to Aberdeen, a service from Lossiemouth and Elgin to Aberdeen and a Saturday service from Inverness to Keith that after 19 June was accelerated and extended to Aberdeen. There were no Sunday services.

Its watershed spans parts of Northumberland, Montour, Lycoming, and Columbia counties in Pennsylvania. West Branch Chillisquaque Creek is about five miles long. The creek is home to a number of tree species and herb species. There are also five main types of rock formations and four main types of soil in the creek's watershed.  Course  West Branch Chillisquaque Creek in the summer West Branch Chillisquaque Creek is long. It starts slightly east of Anthony Township and flows west. It flows southwest for some distance before turning nearly due south and passing under Pennsylvania Route 44 on its way through the community of Exchange. West Branch Chillisquaque Creek picks up its only named tributary, County Line Branch, right at its confluence with Chillisquaque Creek. The creek empties into Chillisquaque Creek above Washingtonville.  Geology  West Branch Chillisquaque Creek is situated in the Ridge-and-Valley province. The creek's headwaters are higher than its mouth. The watershed is highest in its northeastern area. Ninety percent of the upper portions of the watershed of West Branch Chillisquaque Creek are over sedimentary rock. The particular rock formations that are common in this area of the watershed include the Hamilton Group, the Onondaga/Old Port formation, Trimmers Rock, and the Wills Creek Formation. The other rock formations in this section of the watershed are mostly shale and carbonate minerals. These include such formations as the Keyser/Tonoloway formation. The Hamilton Group primarily occurs in the central portion of the watershed of West Branch Chillisquaque Creek. The Onondaga/Old Port formation primarily occurs in the southern portion of the watershed, as does the Keyser/Tonoloway formation. The Wills Creek Formation occurs in a small corner in the south- central part of the creek's watershed. The formation known as Trimmers Rock occurs in the northern portion of the watershed. There are a number of different types of soils in the watershed of West Branch Chillisquaque Creek. The great majority of these soils are silt loams. These soils consist of the Watson-Berks-Elvira soil, the Berks-Weikert-Bedington soil, and the Hagerstown-Edom-Washington soil. There is also one non-silt loam soil that can be found in the creek's watershed. It is known as the Chenango-Pope-Holly soil. The Watson-Berks-Elvira soil primarily occurs in the central portion of the watershed of West Branch Chillisquaque Creek. The Berks-Weikert-Bedington soil primarily occurs in the northern portion of the creek's watershed. The Hagerstown-Edom-Washington soil primarily occurs in the south-central and southwestern parts of the watershed. The Chenango-Pope-Holly soil primarily occurs in a small area of the southeastern part of the creek's watershed. The soil is highly fertile in the upper reaches of the watershed of West Branch Chillisquaque Creek. Due to the presence of livestock near West Branch Chillisquaque Creek, parts of the creek's banks experience erosion.  Hydrology  of sediment and of phosphorus pass through the watershed of West Branch Chillisquaque Creek each day. However, there are no instances of point- source pollution in the watershed. West Branch Chillisquaque Creek is similar to Roaring Creek in many respects, such as the level of precipitation in both watersheds.  Watershed  The watershed of West Branch Chillisquaque Creek has an area of . The creek and its tributaries can be accessed via a number of township roads and also via Pennsylvania Route 44 and Pennsylvania Route 54. West Branch Chillisquaque Creek's tributaries include County Line Branch, Beaver Run, and a number of tributaries that are unnamed. The land in West Branch Chillisquaque Creek's watershed consists of 58% agricultural areas, 36% forest, and 6% developed areas. The forested portions of the creek's watershed are primarily in the northern part of the watershed, while the agricultural areas are primarily in the southern and central portions of the creek's watershed. The developed areas are in small sections of the eastern part of the watershed of West Branch Chillisquaque Creek.  History  The 'Chillisquaque' in West Branch Chillisquaque's name comes from a Native American word that refers to a location commonly visited by snowbirds. West Branch Chillisquaque Creek was part of a 2010 stream restoration project.  Fauna and flora  There are http://www.epa.gov/waters/tmdldocs/West%20Branch%20Chillisquaque%20Creek%20TMDL_combo.pdf of streams that have organic enrichment, sediment from agricultural projects, and a low level of dissolved oxygen. Where the creek flows past agricultural areas, its riparian buffer is severely impaired. However, at the headwaters of West Branch Chillisquaque Creek, there are northern hardwoods and hemlock forests. There are also numerous wild leeks and other spring flowers near the creek's headwaters. The hardwoods and hemlocks act like a buffer for the creek itself. There are 12 common species of trees in the watershed of West Branch Chillisquaque Creek. There are 22 species of herbs that are common in the creek's watershed. Ovenbirds, black-throated green warblers, wood thrushes, blue-headed vireo and common yellowheads are the major species of birds in the watershed.

Early life and migration to Alexandria Born in 1766 in England, John Gadsby's earliest known record in the United States is in 1795. He traveled with his wife, Margaret Smelt, and his two daughters, Ann Sophia and Margaret Sarah, to Alexandria, Virginia, then a major shipping port. His first establishment was at the Union Tavern and Coffee House in Alexandria, a subscription coffee house that catered to business men in the middle and upper classes. City Hotel On October 6, 1796 Gadsby leased the City Hotel from John Wise, now the site of Gadsby's Tavern Museum in Alexandria. The tavern quickly became the center for community events, from the George Washington birthnight ball to dancing assemblies to meetings of local clubs, particularly the Alexandria Jockey Club of which Gadsby was a benefactor. He made money renting his carriages and investing in a stagecoach line. When he renegotiated his lease, Gadsby's property and possessions totaled $22,441. His most valuable \\"possessions\\" were the enslaved African- Americans who comprised the majority of his staff. By 1805, Gadsby's first wife Margaret had died, and he married Peggy McLaughlin of Georgetown. He then quickly married off his daughters. First, Margaret Sarah Gadsby was married to Charles Thomas Chapman in 1807, and the couple had a son, John Gadsby Chapman, by 1808. In July of that year Ann Sophia Gadsby married Augustine Newton. Though at that point Gadsby still had eight years remaining on his lease with John Wise, he abruptly sold it and moved to Baltimore, possibly for economic opportunity. Indian Queen Hotel The Indian Queen Hotel, at Hanover and Baltimore Streets, was a sizeable tavern that showed off new mechanical innovations, including a steam kitchen, stew stove, patent oven, and smoke jacks to move a large coffee roaster and mechanical spits. In addition to his tavern's position as a stagecoach station on four lines, this hostelry par excellence brought Gadsby both a fortune and an excellent reputation in Baltimore. Guest Samuel Breck wrote: On May 10, 1808, Gadsby and Peggy had a son, William. But on February 12, 1812, Peggy passed away, and a short 11 months later, Gadsby married Providence \\"Provey\\" (Norris) Langworthy, twenty years his junior. The Norris family was prominent in Baltimore and attended numerous events at the Indian Queen Hotel. The patriarch of the family, Provey's father Benjamin Bradford Norris, was significant in town for being a signer of the Bush Declaration. The couple had three children in Baltimore: Virginia (1813), Augusta (1816), and Julia (1818). They also had a son, Charles, who died as a young child. Of the many notable guests Gadsby welcomed before, during, and after the Battle of Baltimore, Francis Scott Key would become the most significant. Key finished his song the \\"Defence of Fort McHenry,\\" now better known as \\"The Star-Spangled Banner,\\" at the Indian Queen on September 16, 1814. During the Panic of 1819, Gadsby sold his lease and left Baltimore nearly penniless. The reasons behind his financial downfall are unsure. Gadsby looked toward Washington Hall Hotel in Philadelphia, the next stop on his stagecoach line to the north, for his next venture. He was in negotiations to take over the hotel, but its loss by fire rendered his plans moot. Instead he looked to the next stagecoach stop to the south: Franklin Hotel in Washington, DC. Franklin Hotel In 1824, Gadsby bought up the Franklin Hotel, which had a reputation for hosting the most distinguished men in the nation as they visited Washington. Quickly, the Franklin Hotel became known as Gadsby's Hotel. By 1826, Gadsby's Hotel boasted a billiard room and an extensive coach house as well as parlors, private suites, and rooms for dozens of men. Not all visitors were impressed, however; Lukas Vischer, a Swiss traveler, chronicled the following: Since the carriage ride from the Franklin to the Capitol took forty minutes, the location was not ideal and Gadsby looked elsewhere. The Franklin Hotel became a rental property, and Gadsby began to deal in the real estate business with other private dwellings. National Hotel The grand dining rooms, premier ballrooms, and private suites of the National Hotel, located on Pennsylvania Avenue at Sixth Street, hosted presidents, foreign ministers, congressmen, and prominent travelers. The hotel was originally a series of rowhouses which Gadsby converted into one and contained several stores under the same roof: a bank, a stage office, a wine store, and a lottery office. Two years after the grand opening – the February 22, 1827 George Washington Birthnight Ball at which President John Quincy Adams and most of his administration was present – the hotel was still under construction. By all accounts, the hotel could accommodate several hundred people. A large number of Congressmen resided at Gadsby's Hotel for the season, mostly Congressmen from Massachusetts and South Carolina. Some lived at Gadsby's for as many as seven years. Andrew Jackson stayed at the National Hotel before his inauguration. In 1830, Gadsby owned 39 slaves and employed 4 free black women. Jonathan Elliot praised Gadsby's individualism and perseverance as a businessman as his personal charm: In 1835, Gadsby's daughter Augusta married John Hollins McBlair, a grocer and eventual army officer. Another of his daughters, Virginia, died in July 1836 at the age of 20. She was much lamented in the local papers, where she was remembered as her kindred's \\"centre of light and life.\\" Retirement to Decatur House Gadsby retired in September 1836 at the age of 70, leaving the business to his son William. He bought Decatur House, one of the largest residences in DC that had a history of grand entertaining, for $12,000 at auction on October 24, 1836. Ten slaves moved with the Gadsbys from the National Hotel to Decatur House. Two families of slaves, the Kings and the Williams, lived in the two-story structure added to the property by the Gadsbys, one of the few extant examples of urban slave quarters. In addition, an enslaved African American named Rosa Marks lived there even through emancipation, and is now buried in the family vault. Occupants of the house included John and Provey, unmarried daughter Julia, married daughter Augusta (with her husband and children), and a young cousin, Mary Augusta Bruff, who would go on to marry William Gadsby. In 1845, Julia married well to John Conover Ten Eyck who went on to serve as a US Senator from New Jersey. Gadsby died on May 15, 1844 at the age of 78 and was buried in Congressional Cemetery. He was remembered as a \\"well-respected and useful citizen.\\" His wife, Provey, died in 1858, operating Decatur House as a boarding house before her death.

He took the lead and with an improvised measuring stick demarcated the areas to be cleared for road and tank building. He had a network of roads built and supplemented the village infrastructure by building reservoirs for irrigating paddy fields and chena cultivations.Ceylon in the Jubilee Year by John Ferguson, pp. 196-7, 202, 350-1, 378 (Nabu Press) The large scale road building projects of de Soysa include the road from Mailapitiya to Hanguranketa and Haragama and the road from Haragama to Kolongaha and Maha Oya in the Central Province.

His specialty is the creation and development of knowledge with the aim of stimulating the economy. This not only includes supporting business ideas with financing, but also making available intellectual capital and sources of knowledge. He developed a system called the Capital Systems Framework as a model for knowledge-based organizations, which has been adopted in various countries. His book Knowledge Cites has been described as successfully challenging “the prevailing urban planning paradigm with a powerful vision of a future based on the critical resource of human capital.” and “the most important new book in urban planning since the publication of Jay Forrester’s “Urban Dynamics.” by Steven A. Cavaleri of Central Connecticut State University. He believes that growing the economy based on knowledge resources is urgent, with Mexico losing competitiveness due to an outdated industrial base, low productivity of is labor force and the lack of political and social cohesion, making it unable to exploit its natural, social and other resources. He also believes that Mexico is capable of an economic level much higher than is generally imagined. He also believes that the Tec of Monterrey is one of the main movers of change in Latin America and the world. He began working with the Tec de Monterrey in 1989, when the new Centro de Tecnologia Avanzada para la Producción, generally called CETEC opened its doors, precisely to join that institution, billed as a center of innovation. He arrived to the Monterrey campus with his wife is Rosa María Sánchez Cantú, who also is a professor and researcher of the institution. In 1992, he established the Centro de Sistemas de Conocimiento (CSC or Center for Knowledge Systems) at the Monterrey campus, which promotes the creation of new knowledge in the Spanish language. With this institution, he has led over 100 contracted projects. In addition to his activities at the Tec de Monterrey, he is also an international consultant and leads another of other organizations and projects.

The south-facing cave, which is rectangular in shape and roughly wide by deep, is in quartz-sandstone and quartzites while its mouth is 19–21 metres above mean sea level. In the same area are two other Stone Age caves, Hoffman’s/Robberg Cave and Matjes River rock shelter which lies about 14 kilometres north at Keurboomstrand. Robberg shows notches, caves and other erosional features caused mainly by wave-cutting at various times in its past, but also due to lithological variation, bedding and characteristics of the bedrock. The cave developed in a breccia often found at the contact between Silurian Table Mountain Series quartzite and Cretaceous Uitenhage Series quartzitic sandstone. Excavations were carried out in 1964-5 by Ray R. Inskeep and again in 1970-1 by Inskeep and Richard G. Klein. The geology and geomorphology of Robberg were well documented by John Rogers in 1966. The cave has yielded rich archaeological material covering its intermittent Middle and Later Stone Age occupation dating from a few hundred to more than 125,000 BP. The cave was abandoned between 40,000 to 20,000 BP during the last Ice Age when the sea level here dropped some 130 metres, the coastline moving about seaward. Lesotho and the South African interior were apparently unoccupied from ~15,000 BP until ~11,500 BP. From 22,000 to 14,000 BP extensive grasslands covered the coastal plateau in the Plettenberg Bay area with no closed evergreen climax forest. Animals that roamed this grassland included giant buffalo, an equine close to the quagga, springbok and alcelaphine antelopes: blesbok/bontebok, wildebeest, hartebeest and a giant alcelaphine. Bones from all these herbivores have been recorded in the cave's middens. The cave occupants enjoyed a variety of food types, ranging from birds and their eggs including ostriches, mammals, plants, fruits and corms to tidal creatures and shellfish, Perna perna and Scutellastra cochlear being collected most frequently; occasionally Cape fur seals from the nearby colony were eaten, also bushpigs, bushbuck and Cape buffalo, the various remains resulting in large middens dating back some 5,000 years, while older remains are thought to have been washed away by rising sea levels. Artefacts range from Stone Age tools (bladelets, bladelet cores, backed bladelets and scrapers, while worked bone and ostrich eggshell beads are also present) to pottery made about 2 000 years ago - the pottery shards and remains of sheep and cattle tell of Khoikhoi farmers who occupied the cave in recent times. Graves have been found near the mouth of the cave, the remains being in a fetal position, and decorated with shells and ochre. Study of the skeletons gives insight into the cave dwellers' diet as revealed by their teeth, and the environment of that time. Because of collapsing sections of the cave in the 1980s, measures were taken to arrest its deterioration.

It is Angelou's second volume of poetry, written after her first two autobiographies and first volume of poetry were published. Angelou considers herself a poet and a playwright, but is best known for her seven autobiographies, especially her first, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, although her poetry has also been successful. She began, early in her writing career, alternating the publication of an autobiography and a volume of poetry. Although her poetry collections have been best- sellers, they have not received serious critical attention. Oh Pray is divided into five parts and consists of 36 poems. The volume is dedicated to \\"Paul\\". Like many of Angelou's poems, the poetry in the volume has been characterized as light verse. They contain identifications with ordinary objects and universal identifications. Oh Pray has received mixed reviews from critics; one critic states that the poems in it are best if read aloud. They focus on themes of love, insight, and tension, and on overcoming difficulties. Angelou writes about ordinary objects and experiences, and with deep feelings, about a variety of racial themes and concerns. Background Oh Pray My Wings are Gonna Fit Me Well is Maya Angelou's second volume of poetry. She studied and began writing poetry at a young age. After her rape at the age of eight, as recounted in her first autobiography I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1969), she dealt with her trauma by memorizing and reciting great works of literature, including poetry, which helped bring her out of her self-imposed muteness. Angelou's film Georgia, Georgia, produced by a Swedish film company and filmed in Sweden, was the first screenplay written by a Black woman, and was released in 1972. Angelou married Welsh carpenter and ex-husband of Germaine Greer, Paul du Feu, in San Francisco in 1973. Although Angelou considered herself a playwright and poet when her editor Robert Loomis challenged her to write Caged Bird, she has been best known for her autobiographies. Many of Angelou's readers identify her as a poet first and an autobiographer second, but like Lynn Z. Bloom, many critics consider her autobiographies more important than her poetry. Critic William Sylvester agrees, and states that although her books have been best-sellers, her poetry has \\"received little serious critical attention\\". Bloom also believes that Angelou's poetry is more interesting when she recites it. Bloom calls Angelou's performances \\"characteristically dynamic\\", and says that she \\"moves exuberantly, vigorously to reinforce the rhythms of the lines, the tone of the words. Her singing and dancing and electrifying stage presence transcend the predictable words and phrases\\". Maya Angelou, reciting her poem, \\"On the Pulse of Morning\\", at the 1993 inauguration of President Bill Clinton Angelou began, early in her writing career, alternating the publication of an autobiography and a volume of poetry. Her first volume of poetry, Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie (1971), which was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, followed her first autobiography, and Oh Pray followed the publication of her second autobiography, Gather Together in My Name (1974). Her publisher, Random House, placed the poems in Oh Pray in her first collection of poetry, The Complete Collected Poems of Maya Angelou (1994), perhaps to capitalize on her popularity following her reading of her poem \\"On the Pulse of Morning\\" at President Bill Clinton's inauguration in 1993. Also in the 1994 collection was Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie and two more published after Oh Pray, And Still I Rise (1978) and Shaker, Why Don't You Sing? (1983). Angelou's publisher placed four more poems in a smaller volume, entitled Phenomenal Woman, in 1995. Themes Many of Angelou's poems can be characterized as light verse. For example, Hagen characterizes \\"On Reaching Forty\\" as a light rumination about growing older. Angelou expresses sadness about having already reaching milestones in her youth, and ends the poem unexpectedly by humorously and ironically expressing admiration for those who die early. In this volume and in others, Angelou pairs poems together (\\"America\\" and \\"Africa\\"; \\"Communication I\\" and Communication II\\") to strengthen her themes. The poems in this volume, like her poems in other volumes and contexts, contain universal identifications with ordinary objects. For example, \\"The Telephone\\" describes her relationship with an object, and how it has intruded upon the silence and solitude of her life. In this poem, which is three structured stanzas long, Angelou demands that the telephone ring, despite her resentment of its intrusion and her dependency upon it. She uses familiar and feminine metaphors, and themes also found in blues songs, such as the colors black and blue and weekend loneliness. In the poem \\"Poor Girl\\", Angelou uses the vernacular to express universal themes, in the voice of a teenage girl who has lost her boyfriend. Scholar Yasmin Y. DeGout cites \\"The Couple\\" as an example of Angelou's practice of subtly including more than one level of meaning in her poems, of her ability to translate her personal experience into political discourse, and her placement of themes of racism and liberation. Angelou combines liberation ideology and poetic technique to challenge society's concepts of gender identity, especially in how it affects women. She varies the length of the poem's lines, beginning in the first stanza and continuing throughout the poem, to convey ambiguity and doubt, and to demand that the reader question their perceptions of gender and power. \\"The Couple\\", starting in its second stanza, attacks class-based ideals of masculinity in society. The poem ends by demanding that the social constructs surrounding gender and class end, and insists that human survival depends upon recognizing shared emotions and experience, regardless of one's gender or position in society. Poems Oh Pray My Wings are Gonna Fit Me Well is divided into five parts, and consists of 36 poems. The volume is dedicated to \\"Paul\\".

She calls \\"This Winter Day\\" colorful and pleasant, and states that it reminds her of a genre painting. She, like many critics about much of Angelou's poetry, says, \\"The poems work best read aloud\\". The critic in Booklist considers the way in which the poems are organized distracting, but says that it \\"does not diminish the street-wise soundings infused with a particular pain and pride\\". According to the review, the rhyme in \\"Here's to Adhering\\" is simple, but its structure is deceptively complex. The critic also says, \\"The sardonic quality of 'On Reaching Forty' reduces age to a minor milestone; nationhood is elevated to a higher yet deeper plane in 'Africa' and in 'America.' 'The Pusher' is a typical Angelou acceleration, but it is 'Chicken-Licken' that causes a dead halt\\". Poetry critic Sandra Gilbert says that Angelou's poems, \\"when they're not awkward or stilted, are corny\\". According to a reviewer in Choice, the poems in Oh Pray focus on themes of love, insight, and tension. They also focus on \\"the black condition celebrated triumphant over difficulties\\". The reviewer finds some poems uneven, sometimes banal, also best if read aloud, and meant to \\"be reread and laughed over and thought about\\". Reviewer James Finn Cotter states that this volume suffers from \\"the dangers of success\\" that happen when poets gain too much fame too soon. Gilbert blames Angelou's publishers for capitalizing on her success as an autobiographer, stating that Oh Pray \\"...is such a painfully untalented collection of poems that I can't think of any reason other than the Maya myth for it to be in print\\". Writer Lyman B. Hagen responds to Gilbert's criticism by stating that Angelou had been a poet long before she began writing prose and that Angelou's audience is comfortable with her sparse lines. He insists that Angelou's critics have missed the power of her poems' message in her apparently simple lines. Hagen calls Angelou's poetry light verse. He states that she writes about ordinary objects and experiences, and with deep feelings, about a variety of racial themes and concerns. References Citations Works cited * Bloom, Harold. (2001).

Billy Mitchell,http://www.army.mil/article/33680 operating out of Langley Field, Virginia, that was used in Project B to demonstrate the vulnerability of ships to aerial attack when, in July 1921, the \\"unsinkable\\" German dreadnought SMS Ostfriesland was sent to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean by bombardment. Other targets included the German destroyer SMS G-102, the SMS Frankfurt, and the USS Iowa. Formation In the wake of the disarmament following the conclusion of the Great War, with the aviation branch of the U.S. Army drastically reduced in size, Col. Mitchell felt that the U.S. Navy's focus on building super dreadnoughts was a waste of defense money as he was convinced that warships were now vulnerable to air attack. He published articles and had testified before the House subcommittee on aviation \\"that 1,000 bomber aircraft could be built and operated for the cost of one dreadnought and that his airplanes could sink a battleship. He volunteered to demonstrate this if the navy would provide him with some battleships, which were already due to be demolished. The navy reluctantly agreed to the demonstrations.\\" \\"Once the test was agreed to, Mitchell formed the First Provisional Air Brigade, drawing 150 airplanes and 1,000 people from air bases around the country. Because none of the pilots knew how to sink ships, extensive training was required at Langley Field in Virginia, where practice missions against mock ships were performed. Among the officers attending the practices was Alexander de Seversky, who had served with Russia during the war, dropping bombs on German ships. He taught the pilots that the best way to sink a ship was to drop the bomb near, not on, the ship.\\" Tests \\"The test, held off the mouth of Chesapeake Bay in July, 1921 attracted widespread public interest. There, after naval aircraft in June had easily disposed of a surfaced U-boat, Mitchell's First Provisional Air Brigade, hastily assembled and trained at Langley Field, attacked and sank three German ships -- a destroyer, the cruiser Frankfurt, and the heavily compartmented Ostfriesland. Disputes arose as to the manner in which the experiment -- directed by the Navy - had been conducted, and the Joint Board's report tended to deprecate the effectiveness of aerial bombing. But the fact of the sinkings was indisputable, and Mitchell went on to clinch the validity of his claims by tests conducted with like results on obsolete US Battleships -- the Alabama in September, 1921, and the Virginia and New Jersey in September, 1923.\\"Craven, W.

William Wells was born at Biggleswade. He was orphaned when young, cared for by an uncle, Ebenezer Custerson a farmer at Cardington, Bedfordshire, and educated by Rev Samuel Sanderson (1702–66) at Bedford. He studied under Caleb Ashworth at Daventry Academy, 1765–70, a fellow student with Thomas Belsham. He was appointed minister at Bromsgrove Presbyterian Chapel in 1770, where he remained until 1793. January 1771 he married Jane Hancox of Dudley.Sprague. In the troubles which preceded American Independence, he took a strong interest in favour of the Colonies, taking an active part with Richard Price, Thomas Wren of Portsmouth,Sheldon S Cohen; \\"[Thomas Wren], ministering angel of Forton Prison,\\" The Pennsylvania magazine of history and biography, no.103 (Philadelphia, 1979), 279-301. in garnering subscriptions for the relief of the American Prisoners. Convinced of the benefits of smallpox inoculation, he inoculated his own children, and inoculated the children of poor neighbours, who could not afford the surgeons' fee. He is said to have spent two years riding about the country, inoculating as many as thirteen hundred children.Sprague. During the Birmingham riots, his home was threatened and the meeting-house escaped only by accident. Wells had been contemplating emigration to New England since 1780. He was now resolved upon it, arriving at Boston, with his wife and eight children, 12 June 1793. He was soon joined by William Priestley, son of Dr Joseph Priestley, who stayed with the family, perhaps helping with Wells's farm.Mary R Crowninshield, \\"Correspondence of Dr William Bentley,\\" New-England Historical and Genealogical Register, vol.27 (Boston, 1873), 356-7. The next year, he purchased a farm at Brattleboro, Vermont, where he lived until his death.Sprague. He corresponded with William Bentley and other Unitarians in New England After a year or two, he was invited to become minister at Brattleboro, but declined a formal appointment. He agreed, however, to perform the functions of that office as 'officiating pastor', on an annual basis, being annually chosen by the town for about twenty years.Sprague. While he was absent on a visit to England, in 1818, he was awarded a Doctorate of Divinity from Harvard University.

They were considered anti-hardcore, with the members, especially guitarist and lyricist Frank Price, vehement about their abhorrence towards the punk youth subculture. The band was known for their confrontational stage performances, which normally involved aggressively baiting their punk audience. They were influenced by Public Image Ltd. and Flipper. They released three full-length albums, two released independently and one issued through Touch and Go Records. A fourth album that was recorded in 1987 but never released was finally issued as More in 2001.  History  No Trend formed in 1982 in Ashton, Maryland and consisted of Jeff Mentges (vocals), Bob Strasser (bass), Frank Price (guitar), and Michael Salkind (drums). Prior to No Trend, Mentges, Salkind, Strasser and Brad Pumphrey (guitar) were a band called the Aborted; they nearly played out with Government Issue. No Trend formed as a reaction against the growing punk rock movement of the time. Their early period has been described as \\"dark\\" and \\"nihilistic\\". The group intended to write a single song for one performance only, but the group soon wrote enough material for a release: their debut extended play, the Teen Love EP, a 7\\" independently issued by the band. In August of 1983, Strasser and Salkind left the band. Jack Anderson (bass) and Greg Miller (drums) joined and the quintet released their first full-length studio album, titled Too Many Humans, which met moderate success within the American underground music scene. In the spring of 1984 the band rerecorded the Teen Love 7” and released it as a 12” with two additional tracks. After an aborted tour during the summer of 1984, Price, Anderson and Miller all left the group, leaving Mentges as the only member of the group. Mentges would later get other musicians to join the band, and the newly reformed No Trend would go back in studio to record their second record, A Dozen Dead Roses, which was released in 1985. This record featured a significant change in sound when compared to the cold, noisy tone found on previous releases. The record featured vocalist Lydia Lunch contributing to multiple songs. The songs that featured Lunch were released previously on the 10\\" extended play Heart of Darkness through her label Widowspeak Productions. She also issued a No Trend compilation album in 1986, titled When Death Won't Solve Your Problems, through the same label. The band would later be signed to Touch and Go Records and would release their third album, Tritonian Nash-Vegas Polyester Complex, through them in 1986. A fourth album was recorded in 1987, but after they showed the label the record, Touch and Go refused to release it, deeming that it was \\"too weird\\" to release. They were unable to find a label to release the album, effectively putting an end to the band. The album would remain unreleased until Morphious Archives, a label that specializes in releasing obscure records, gained the rights to release the album. It was finally issued in 2001 as More. After the group's official disbandment, Jeff Mentges attended the University of Maryland as a film student, and subsequently directed the John Holmes biographical film Of Flesh and Blood in 1990. Founding member and original No Trend guitarist Frank Price committed suicide in 1989, which brought shock to both members and fans of the band. A compilation of unreleased studio and live tracks was released through TeenBeat Records in 1995, titled The Early Months. Musical Style The band originally started out as a noise rock outfit, with critics comparing their sound to hardcore punk and industrial music. As shown on Teen Love and, to a greater extent, Too Many Humans, the band's music typically revolved around Bob Strasser's repetitive basslines. Michael Salkind's drums were quick-paced, and Frank Price's guitar riffs were mostly composed of guitar feedback. Their sound quickly changed with A Dozen Dead Roses, which focused much more on jazz rock, funk music, and experimental rock to a lesser extent.Tritonian Nash-Vegas Polyester Complex dug deeper into the musical stylings of A Dozen Dead Roses, and More included major classic rock influences.

It was published during one of the most productive periods in Angelou's career; she had written four autobiographies and published three other volumes of poetry up to that point. Angelou considered herself a poet and a playwright, but was best known for her seven autobiographies, especially her first, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, although her poetry has also been successful. She began, early in her writing career, alternating the publication of an autobiography and a volume of poetry. Many of the poems in Shaker focus on survival despite threatened freedom, lost love, and defeated dreams. Over half of them are love poems, and emphasize the inevitable loss of love. \\"Caged Bird\\", which refers to Angelou's first autobiography, is contained in this volume. Background Shaker, Why Don't You Sing is Maya Angelou's fourth volume of poetry. She studied and began writing poetry at a young age. After her rape at the age of eight, as recounted in her first autobiography I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1969), she dealt with her trauma by memorizing and reciting great works of literature, including poetry, which helped bring her out of her self-imposed muteness. The publication of Shaker, Why Don't You Sing occurred during one of the most productive periods of Angelou's career. She had written songs for Roberta Flack and had composed movie scores. She had written articles, short stories, TV scripts and documentaries, autobiographies, and poetry, she produced plays, and was named a visiting professor of several colleges and universities. Angelou was given a multitude of awards during this period, including over thirty honorary degrees from colleges and universities from all over the world. In 1981, after ten years of marriage, Angelou and her husband Paul du Feu divorced. Angelou returned to the southern United States, where she accepted the lifetime Reynolds Professorship of American Studies at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and taught a variety of subjects that reflected her interests, including philosophy, ethics, theology, science, theater, and writing. Although Angelou considered herself a playwright and poet when her editor Robert Loomis challenged her to write Caged Bird, she has been best known for her autobiographies. Many of Angelou's readers identify her as a poet first and an autobiographer second, but like Lynn Z. Bloom, many critics consider her autobiographies more important than her poetry. Critic William Sylvester agrees, and states that although her books have been best-sellers, her poetry has \\"received little serious critical attention\\". Bloom also believes that Angelou's poetry is more interesting when she recites them. Bloom calls her performances \\"characteristically dynamic\\", and says that Angelou \\"moves exuberantly, vigorously to reinforce the rhythms of the lines, the tone of the words. Her singing and dancing and electrifying stage presence transcend the predictable words and phrases\\". Bill Clinton's inauguration in 1993 Angelou's began, early in her writing career, alternating the publication of an autobiography and a volume of poetry. By the time Shaker was published in 1983, she had published four autobiographies, eventually going on to publish seven. Her publisher, Random House, placed the poems in Shaker in her first collection of poetry, The Complete Collected Poems of Maya Angelou (1994), perhaps to capitalize on her popularity following her reading of her poem \\"On the Pulse of Morning\\" at President Bill Clinton's inauguration in 1993. Also in the 1994 collection were her three previous collections, Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie (1971), Oh Pray My Wings Are Gonna Fit Me Well, and And Still I Rise (1978), along with I Shall Not Be Moved, published in 1990. Angelou's publisher placed four poems in a smaller volume, entitled Phenomenal Woman in 1995. Themes According to critic Carol E. Neubauer, like Angelou's previous poetry collections, \\"Shaker celebrates the ability to survive despite threatened freedom, lost love, and defeated dreams. Neubauer also states that the poems in this volume are full of \\"the control and confidence that have become characteristic of Angelou's work in general\\". Their tone moves from themes of strength to humor and satire, and captures, more than her previous poetry, the loneliness of lovers and the sacrifice that many slaves experienced without succumbing to defeat or despair. Over half the poems in Shaker focus on love and doomed relationships. In \\"The Lie\\", for example, the speaker feels compelled to use deception to protect herself from her lover's abandonment. In the brief poem \\"Prelude to a Parting\\", the speaker instinctively senses the inevitable and implicit end of her relationship, especially when her lover draws away from her touch. Not all the love poems in the volume focus on dishonesty or deception, but most, such as the title poem \\"Shaker, Why Don't You Sing?\\", describe the inevitable loss of love. The rest of the poems in Shaker emphasize determination despite the \\"unabiding anguish over the oppression of the black race\\", and deal with the cruel treatment of slaves in the South. In the poem \\"Family Affairs\\", Angelou uses the German fairy tale \\"Rapunzel\\" as a framework to summarize her painful origins of slavery and to compare Black/white tensions. Critic J. T. Keefe calls it \\"a wise and deeply felt poem\\". Neubauer considers Angelou's poem \\"Caged Bird\\", which she says \\"inevitably brings Angelou's audience full circle\\" with her first autobiography, as the most powerful poem in the volume. Keefe agrees, and calls it Angelou's \\"central motif\\" and a rhythmical and hypnotic chant that cries out to be sung\\". Neubauer states, \\"Her poems in Shaker, Why Don't You Sing imply that as long as such melodies are sung and heard, hope and strength will overcome defeated dreams\\". Scholar Yasmin Y. DeGout agrees, and cites \\"A Plagued Journey\\" as an example of Angelou's themes of liberation found in all her poetry. In the poem, Angelou calls for a reconsideration of the beliefs that limit human beings, and insists that \\"hope allows action and forces engagement with the world\\". Reviews Janet B. Blundell, in Library Journal, finds Angelou's poetry lacking in comparison to her prose, and states, \\"The reader is jarred by stilted, 'poetic' language and stilted, sing-song, school- girlish rhyme\\". She finds the best poems in Shaker are the ones that are structured like blues music. Mary S. Cosgrove, in Horn Book Magazine, calls the poems in Shaker \\"a lyrical outpouring of seasoned feelings from the heart and mind\\", and calls Angelou \\"musical, rhythmical, and enchanting\\". J.T. Keefe, in World Literature Today, says about Shaker\\": \\"Deceptively light and graceful, Maya Angelou's poems are lyrical, emotional, melancholy\\". Keefe compares Angelou's poems to music, especially the music of French singer Édith Piaf, and also states, \\"These poems are full of shining hurt as, like curving scimitars, they skillfully pierce the hearts of their readers\\". Poems Shaker, Why Don't You Sing?, which contains 28 poems, is dedicated to Angelou's son, Guy Johnson, and to her grandson, Colin Ashanti Murphy Johnson. * \\"Awakening in New York\\" * \\"A Good Woman Feeling Bad\\" * \\"The Health-Food Diner\\" * \\"A Georgia Song\\" * Unmeasured Tempo\\" * \\"Amoebaean for Daddy\\" * \\"Recovery\\" * \\"Impeccable Conception\\" * \\"Caged Bird\\" * \\"Avec Merci, Mother\\" * \\"Arrival\\" * \\"A Plagued Journey\\" * \\"Starvation\\" * \\"Contemporary Announcement\\" * \\"Prelude to a Parting\\" * \\"Martial Choreography\\" * \\"To a Suitor\\" * \\"Insomniac\\" * \\"Weekend Glory\\" * \\"The Lie\\" * \\"Prescience\\" * \\"Family Affairs\\" * \\"Changes\\" * \\"Brief Innocence\\" * \\"The Last Decision\\" * \\"Slave Coffle\\" * \\"Shaker, Why Don't You Sing?\\" * \\"My Life Has Turned to Blue\\" References Citations Works cited * Bloom, Harold (2001).

Founded in 1993, the non-profit organization was still in business in 2003, during the 10th anniversary of the Los Angeles riots from which it was born.  Early history  The program was founded in 1993 in the aftermath of the 1992 Los Angeles riots. In the wake of the riots, Crenshaw High School biology teacher Tammy Bird, met a non-profit organization, Gardens For Kids, which offered to help her restore the garden in the back of her classroom. Melinda McMullen, a public relations executive, joined Bird shortly thereafter. Together, they offered students at Crenshaw High School the opportunity to help rebuild their community by reclaiming a 1/4-acre weed-infested plot of land behind Bird's classroom. Initially, the students decided to grow organic foods and donate 25% of their bounty to a local non-profit organization called \\"Helpers for the Homeless and the Hungry\\". They decided they would sell the rest at the Santa Monica Farmer's Market under the name \\"Food from the 'Hood\\". At the end of the first year, they had a total of $600, which funded small college scholarships for the three graduating students. With more students scheduled to graduate the following year, it was clear that the students needed another plan. 2,000 dollars in scholarships in the recent years  Press coverage and growth  In October 1993, Ron Harris, a columnist for the Los Angeles Times, publicized their story in a widely-read column. Norris Bernstein, former president of Bernstein's Salad Dressing, heard about the students' efforts and contacted Food from the 'Hood. Now retired, Bernstein volunteered to help with the final work on the salad dressing formula, help price the product, and develop a marketing plan. Bernstein became part of the adult team of advisers. Bird supervised the students' work garden and helped manage the weekly trips to the Santa Monica Farmers' market, while McMullen focused on trying to generate visibility for the effort. Eventually, CBS Morning News took an interest in the story and sent national correspondent Hattie Kauffman out to cover the story. Over the next three years, Kauffman became close to the students—eventually doing three pieces on Food from the 'Hood. Within a week of the piece airing on CBS Morning News, the students received a call from a representative from Rebuild LA, a non-profit organization formed after the riots to help revitalize of the city that were impacted by the riots. An executive from one of their founding companies had seen the piece on CBS Morning News and wanted to learn more. The students had their business plan ready and within a few weeks Food from the 'Hood, then a 501(c) corporation, received a $50,000 grant to help scale up their salad dressing company. In December 1993, the students farmed and donated holiday food packages to \\"Helpers for the Homeless and the Hungry\\". A few months later, the students from Food From the 'Hood launched the first in what would become a line of three flavors of Food from the 'Hood salad dressing. The group continued to garner press coverage, including during a visit from Prince Charles, and a trip to Washington D.C. to be honored at Newsweek Magazine's American Achievement Awards. Their salad dressing that was then in more than 2,000 grocery stores in 22 western states. In 1995, the original founders of Food From the 'Hood graduated from Crenshaw High School. Nearly all of the graduates went on to attend four-year colleges, including University of California, Berkeley; San Diego State; Babson College; Howard University; University of California, Santa Cruz; California State, Northridge; Stanford University; Cornell College; Carnegie Mellon University; and Moorehouse College.  Later years and closing  Food from the 'Hood continued for a number of years after the original founders went off to college, and continued to fund college scholarships. In 2002, Oprah Winfrey awarded the organization a major contribution as part of her \\"Use Your Life\\" Awards. The organization closed a few years later, but many of the Food From the 'Hood student-owners continue to stay in close touch.

Probably of humble origins in one of the Illyrician provinces of the Empire he was one of the group of men from this region who chose a military career – or had it chosen for them – whose professional capabilities brought them to the fore of public life in those troubled times. Marcianus rose to the highest levels of the military hierarchy. The evidence suggests that he earned the trust of the Emperors Gallienus and Claudius II and, possibly, Marcus Aurelius Probus among their successors and that he was one of the principal commanders in the prolonged war against a coalition of what the late antique Greek writers called Scythian peoples whose incursions in that period seemed to threaten the very survival of the Roman state. These would refer to the major Germanic and Iranian peoples, among them the Goths and Roxolani, who invaded the Roman empire across the lower Danube River. Nothing is known of his private life.  The sources  = Literary =  Ancient  The notoriously inaccurate Scriptores Historiae Augustae (SHA) make several references to Marcianus's military exploits in two of the Imperial uitae, i.e. the Duo Gallieni (the Two Gallieni)SHA(DG) and the Diui Claudii (the Deified Claudius),SHA(DC:) albeit solely in relation to his role in dealing with barbarian incursions into the Imperial provinces of the region now described as South Eastern Europe in 267–8 AD.But, still often referred to familiarly as 'the Balkans' They also assert that he was deeply involved in the conspiracy of senior officers that led to the assassination of Gallienus in 268 AD and his replacement by Claudius II – i.e. Claudius Gothicus. The only other ancient literary source in which Marcianus is securely attested is the Νέα Ιστορία (\\"New History\\") of the Greek historian, Zosimus.Zos Zosimus's \\"Marcianus\\" is generally agreed to be the same man as that referred to in the SHA,Gerov(1965:passim) but he is mentioned only once in the \\"New History\\" and then in a purely military context. However, Zosimus's failure to make any mention of him in relating the events of the army marshals' coup against Gallienus is considered very significant by some modern commentators. It was at one time believed that Marcianus was to be identified with the Marianus who was one of three leaders mentioned in a recently discovered fragment of Dexippus as coordinating Greek resistance to a Gothic invasion that swept across the Balkans in the early 260s. However recent scholarship has established Marianus as a previously unknown governor of AchaiaDexippus and the Gothic Invasions: Interpreting the New Vienna Fragment (Codex Vindobonensis Hist. gr. 73, ff 192-193)  Secondary  The only modern biography specifically devoted to Marcianus is that of Gerov which was written in 1965. Gerov wrote before recent archaeological and numismatic discoveries encouraged the development of a new view of Imperial activity in Asia during the reign of Claudius II and Marcianus's possible involvement in this. Thus his biography did not consider the possibility that Marcianus commanded an expedition to counter Scythian incursions into Asia region at this time, for which the only literary reference was an off-hand statement in Zosimus. In addition, he was not able to take account of the very critical examination of the SHA material that took place from the late-1960s onwards, especially by Sir Ronald Syme, which might have affected his willingness to accept the account of Marcianus's activity propagated by that work. Although Gerov's paper is still considered the standard study of Marcianus, it is now possible to come to significantly different conclusions on some points. = Epigraphic =  Reference to Marcianus authoritatively established  There are three epigraphic inscriptions that have been identified by published authorities as relating to the Marcianus of the ancient literary sources – albeit with varying degrees of confidence. These add considerably to the knowledge of his career derived from the literary sources: 1\\\\. From Philippopolis, Thracia (ancient city located in modern Plovdiv, Bulgaria):AE 1965, 114 (Thracia) This inscription (in Greek) comes from a monument set up by the Town-Council and People of Philippopolis honouring one \\"Marcianus\\" (i.e. no praenomen or nomen) who saved the city when it was besieged by an unidentified enemy. The identification with the Marcianus of the literary sources (see above) was first made by Gerov;Gerov(1965:353) 2\\\\. From Termessos, Lycia et Pamphylia province, (ancient city located on Mount Dagi ( Taurus Mountains)), Antalya province, Turkey):AE1978, 802) This inscription (in Greek) is from a monument set up by the Town-Council and People of Termessos dedicated to one \\"L. Aurelius Marcianus\\", a \\"patron and benefactor\\" of the city who \\"brought peace\\". It is now proposed that this dates from the reign of Claudius II and that the dedicatee can be identified with the Marcianus of the Philippopolis Inscription.Biagi(2006:363fn19) The Termessos inscription provides the only secure reference to Marcianus's praenomen (i.e. Lucius); however, his nomen is also confirmed in a third inscription 3\\\\. Discovered in Rhodes, but originally from Kibyra, Pamphylia (ancient city in south-west Turkey, near the town of Gölhisar, in Burdur Province: This inscription (in Greek) was on a monument honouring one \\"Aurelius Marcianus\\", who is celebrated as \\"a most generous military leader\\". This inscription, like that from Termessos, is now thought to date from the reign of Claudius II and to honour the same man.Biagi:(2006:passim.)) All three of these inscriptions give the dedicatee the title of διασημότατον (i.e. diasemotaton – nominative form diasemotatos), which is the Greek equivalent of the Latin honorific Vir Perfectissimus. Thus, when the monuments with which they were associated were set up, he was a member of the Second Class of the Roman equestrian order. The viri perfectissimi were invariably men of very high official and social status with close connections to the Imperial Court. Similarly on each of them he is described as a δούξ (doux)- the Greek transliteration of the Latin Dux which was at this time still in the process of developing from a functional title to an established rank in the military hierarchy. All known duces were Viri Perfectissimi.Christol(1978:passim). This suggests that, in addition to military capability, men who were entrusted with this function had to be known personally to and trusted by the reigning Emperor. The status of a vir perfectissimus et dux was an exalted one in the hierarchy of the Imperial Service of the late 260s. (The governor of Lycia et Pamphylia probably ranked no higher than egregius (\\"Select\\"), the Third Grade of the Equestrian OrderChristol(1978:xx).). That all three dedicatees mentioned in these inscriptions not only bore the same cognomen (and in the Asian instances, the same gentilicum), but were also of this rank strengthens the proposition that they were, in fact, the same man who was also the Marcianus referred to by the SHA and Zosimus. If this identification is accepted, the detail of the inscriptions fills out the information relating to Marcianus's service in the war in Achaea and Illyricum under Gallienus that can be derived from the literary record. It also argues for the proposition that he subsequently saw active service against Scythians raiders in Asia for which there is no literary record. In that latter connection, a recent study of a fourth inscription from the ancient city of Sagalassos (Lycia et Pamphylia – modern Antalya province, Turkey) seems to throw further light on his career. The Sagalassos document does not mention Marcianus specifically, but it does indicate that the operations against the Scythian pirates in the Eastern Mediterranean under Claudius II mentioned by Zosimus involved a significant land operation under Claudius II in Pisidian Asia. This encouraged a review of the then current interpretations of the Marcianus inscriptions ... not established  A further inscription (in Latin) discovered near Salona, Dalmatia, (now Split, Croatia) honouring the Emperor Marcus Aurelius Probus was dedicated by an \\"Aurelius Marcianus\\", a Vir Perfectissimus, described as Praeses, i.e. equestrian governor, of the province of Dalmatia.CIL III.8707 (Dalmatia). The invocation of Probus as the reigning Emperor fixes this document to the period 276–82 AD which means that the dedicator was at least a contemporary of the Marcianus of the literary record. The possibility that he was that Marcianus is not inherently unlikely, but the identification has yet to be securely established.Mennen(2011:141fn 21).  Origins  There is no information from the ancient sources relating to Marcianus's date or place of birth but he is generally assumed to have had his origin in one of the Danubian provinces – i.e. Illyricum.Potter(2004:265). His nomen/gentilicum, (i.e. \\"Aurelius\\"), would usually be taken to indicate that his family was admitted to Roman citizenship as a result of the Emperor Caracalla's Constitutio Antoniniana of 212 AD. This would mean that he was certainly not a member of the aristocracy that had ruled the Empire under the Severan Dynasty, but owed his prominence to his own capabilities.  Rise to eminence  Information for Marcianus's career in the years before he was entrusted with senior commands is almost non-existent. The only literary reference is from Zosimus who, recording Marcianus's appointment as theatre-commander in the war against Scythian invaders of Illyricum in 268 AD – see below – remarked that he was: > ... a man of great experience in military affairs.Zos(1.40))) This indicates that his early career had been mainly as a soldier.Mennen(2011.234) It is most likely that Marcianus enlisted as a common soldier which would suggest that he had to serve many years before achieving commissioned rank. On this period of his life, apart from Zosimus's aside – see above – the sources are entirely silent. The Philippopolis Inscription (epigraphic source 1. above) records that before he began to receive Imperial commissions as a dux Marcianus had been the tribunus of a Praetorian Cohort and a Protector of Gallienus. (See Protectores Augusti Nostri). This indicates that, whatever his beginnings, he had not only survived involvement in the almost incessant warfare that was the condition of a soldier serving in the Illyrician garrisons in the middle decades of the Third Century, but also that he thereby distinguished himself and that by the mid-260s he had achieved equestrian status and had been singled out for promotion to the most senior commands. Praetorian tribuni were chosen from among officers who were members of the Equestrian Order by the Emperor himself, usually on the recommendation of the Praetorian Prefect or other persons of influence in Court Circles.Dobson(1974:411-13 and 417-20) His status as a protector was almost certainly acquired during Gallienus's sole reign (260–8 AD) when these appointments were made from among senior Praetorian officers or legionary prefects (see, again, Volusianus and also Publius Aelius Aelianus) for by the end of Gallienus's reign and certainly under Claudius II these men were being appointed from the centurions of all units attached to the Imperial field-army – see Traianus Mucianus. Progression to more senior commands by way of a tour of duty in the units of the Roman garrison (sometimes with successive postings to the Vigiles, the Cohortes Urbanae and the Praetorian Guard) and admission to the ranks of the Protectores Augusti Nostri was a career-path followed by a number of Marcianus's eminent near-contemporaries.  Career as a field- officer  The praetorian tribunate mentioned on the Philippopolis Inscription is the only known reference to Marcianus as a member of the regular military hierarchy in command of a specific unit of the army as traditionally organised – albeit with no hint as to which of the ten cohorts of the Guard he commanded. Otherwise he is always described as a dux. In this capacity he would have commanded composite forces consisting of detachments (vexillationes) of regular units put together to deal with particular emergencies that the local provincial garrisons were unable to deal with. In exercising such commands he would have been answerable to the Emperor directly.Smith(1978:278) His recorded military exploits in this capacity all relate to campaigns undertaken against incursions of barbarian war-bands from the region to the north of the Black Sea known to the Romans as Scythia in the period 267–69 AD. The details of this war are obscure. The narrative used here to put the scrappy references of the SHA and Zosimus into some sort of historical context is that described in the Battle of Naissus and by Biagi. = In Europe =  Actions in Achaea  Marcianus's first recorded military exploit was a victory he won over Scythian invaders in the province of Achaea.SHA(DG:6.1) It is now accepted that this action related to the Scythian incursions that took place in 267 AD.Gerov(1965:passim). The enemy were part of a sea-born force that had arrived in Grecian waters after an eventful voyage across the Black Sea and into the Aegean and the Eastern Mediterranean.Forgiarini(1998:85) At first things had gone well for them and they had sacked Athens and then ravaged the Peloponnese as far south as Sparta. However, a Roman naval force seems to have destroyed many of their ships and, as they retired northwards overland, a force of Athenian militia under Dexippus inflicted a defeat on them near that city.Alfoldi(1965:149). Their encounter with Marcianus's army was their first with regular Roman troops and, although he too managed to defeat them, the engagement was inconclusive. The barbarians seem to have retired in good order, withdrawing northward as a coherent force. However, somewhere in Illyricum they were intercepted by the Imperial field-army under Gallienus which won a substantial victory in the valley of the River Nestos (which marked the border between the provinciae of Macedonia and Thracia) persuading the war-leader of the \\"Heruli\\", Naulobatus, to make peace with the Emperor. This action probably took place before the end of the year 267 AD.Gerov(1965:338). It is not known if Marcianus was present, but Gerov considered that he retained his independent command after Gallienus took charge of the war in Illyricum. (As noted above, the relief of Philippopolis probably took place in the autumn of that year). ... and Illyricum, 267–8 AD...  Marcianus is next recorded: This reference is rather opaque, but, it is interpreted to mean that after the Imperial victory over Naulobatus's war-band on the Nestos, Marcianus was given the task of clearing Illyricum of other Scythian invaders who seem to have been inspired by the initial success of the \\"Goths\\" and \\"Heruli\\" in Achaea and the eastern Mediterranean to swarm into the Balkans.Gerov(1965:xx). Gerov suggests that after the action by the Nestos the Romans were essentially engaged in \\"mopping up\\" operations against an enemy already defeated. However, as indicated, the language of the SHA gives the impression that the fighting was difficult and inconclusive and served only to stir up more barbarian attacks. The Uita Diui Claudii appears to suggest that the future Emperor Claudius and Marcianus served as joint-commanders in this campaign.SHA(DC,18.1) Furthermore, it is inferred that, whereas \\"Gothic\\" bands > escaped Marcianus after he had chastised them... Claudius fared rather better in the SHA account > ... hoping to prevent what actually came to pass [i.e. the necessity for a > major campaign against Scythian invaders] (he) had not allowed [them] to > break forth.SHA(DC,6.1) It is possible that Claudius did indeed serve alongside Marcianus although, if he did so, it was probably as Marcianus's subordinate/lieutenant.Gerov(1965:348-9). There is really no means of deciding who was the most effective commander in the field. However, recent historians have cast doubt on the notion that Claudius took any part at all in this campaign.Mennen(2011:234,fn177) It may be significant that the Philippopolis Inscription honours Marcianus as the man who raised the siege, an action which seems to have taken place at this time, and makes no reference to Claudius. ... as theatre-commander in Illyricum  Probably shortly after the Battle of the Nestos Gallienus found it necessary to abandon his operations in Illyricum and hurry back to Italy to crush Aureolus who had risen in revolt and seized Mediolanium (Milan). According to Zosimus, he left Marcianus to carry on the war against the Scythians.Zos(40.1) This appointment is not referred to by the SHA or any other ancient source now extant, but seems to be generally accepted by modern historians.e.g. Alfoldi(1965:189), Bray(1997:295) and Watson(1999:49). The title accorded Marcianus on the Philippopolis Inscription, doux kai strateletes, is interpreted by Gerov to mean that, whereas he had been a dux while Gallienus was in command in Illyricum, he was promoted above that rank when the Emperor left him in charge of the war against the Scythians after his own departure to fight Aureolus. This term is the Greek equivalent of the Latin Dux Ducum - i.e. Leader of Leaders (Commander-in-Chief). Gerov cites the instance of the Palmyran general Zabdas who was mentioned in one inscription as the strateletes of the army of Zenobia.}} This title - in the Latin form - was also bestowed on Aurelius Marcellinus in the epigraph on the gate of Verona (CIL, 3329 (ILS, 544) (Verona)).Christol: Les dernieres annees du regne de Gallien (267-8) Cahiers du Centre Glotz 20. Gerov further argues that as strateletes Marcianus's command had a territorial significance in that he was made a Praeses, probably of the two Moesias, provinces which lay athwart the main invasion-route for barbarian incursions from the Black Sea.Gerov(1965:342fn29) Christol argues that it might indicate a wider responsibility for the Balkan provinces as a whole as indicated by Zozozimus - see above. Gerov's interpretation of the title's significance is not accepted by the PLRE which considers that the term indicated no more than that Marcianus was a dux as this was currently understood. It argues that the addition of kai stratelates to the word doux had no other purpose than to \\"assist interpretation\\". However, the phrase is interpreted, it seems likely that Town-Council and Citizens of Philippopolis intended it to be known that Marcianus was in supreme command of the force that had saved their city at its moment of greatest peril and that his only superior was Gallienus: > ... Our August and Unvanquished Lord... This would accord with the meaning of the term doux on Inscriptions 2 and 3 – see above. Zosimus makes no reference to the nature of the war fought by Marcianus in his new capacity. As already indicated, Gerov suggests that, by the time Gallienus left for Italy, all that remained for his successor in Illyricum was to deal with scattered bands of barbarians who knew that they were beaten. However, as also indicated. the SHA can be interpreted to mean that Marcianus was had to deal with new incursions of peoples encouraged by the earlier successes of the \\"Goths\\" and \\"Heruli\\". The presently preferred narrative of this war arguing for a second wave of incursions whose ultimate defeat was only achieved by a supreme effort of the Imperial field-army under the Emperor Claudius in bloody confrontations at the Battle of Naissus and in the central Balkans mountains seems to indicate that Marcianus as Gallienus's theatrre-commander had had to fight a difficult campaign where successes were accompanied by reversals. = Role in the conspiracy against Gallienus = Marcianus is next recorded at Mediolanium where Aureolus was under siege by Gallienus's Imperial field-army. According to Gerov, Aureolus's stubbornly prolonged defence of the city after his defeat in the field had finally obliged Gallienus to summon Marcianus from Illyricum where that officer commanded the only other substantial force currently at his disposal.Gerov(1965:339) According to the SHA in Italy he joined with Aurelius Heraclianus, Gallienus's Praetorian Prefect, in a plot to overthrow the Emperor. By this account the two generals could > ... no longer endure the iniquities of Gallienus... and they accordingly decided that he had to be killed and that one or the other of them should become Emperor in his place.SHA(DG:14.1) The SHA then goes on to suggest that Marcianus was instrumental in contriving the circumstances of Gallienus's deathSHA(DG:14.7) and, when that was accomplished, that it was he who pacified the army rank-and-file which had been enraged by the murder by arranging for the distribution of a substantial donative to each man from the treasury.SHA(DG:15.2) However, whatever the intentions of the principals in the affair, in the event it was Claudius who was chosen to succeed the murdered Gallienus. Claudius had had nothing to do with the conspiracy, but, in the end, everybody agreed that he was > [...]the best man of all....SHA(DG:14.1-9)). The SHA assertion that Marcianus was a principal conspirator is not confirmed by Zosimus – or by any other ancient source. According to the account in the \\"New History\\" it was Claudius who was Heraclianus's co-conspirator. Not only does Zosimus make no mention of Marcianus as being involved in the putsch he fails even to place him at Mediolanium when these dramatic events were unfolding.Zos(1,40) Modern historians are divided on the issue of which of Gallienus's senior officers was complicit in his murder and subsequent replacement by Claudius and, specifically, on the involvement of Marcianus. Gerov considers that he was indeed one of the principals in the conspiracy. Certainly, he is inclined to accept the account of the SHA as exculpating Claudius who he suggests was the posthumous victim of Zosimus's pagan antipathy to his memory as the proclaimed ancestor of Constantine the Great, the first Christian Emperor.Gerov(1965(349–352)) Watson too believes that his fellow-marshals knew that they could rely on the support of Marcianus whether or not he was actually present at Mediolanium.Watson(1998:41). Other historians take the contrary view that Zosimus's account was broadly correct and that the SHA's attempt to involve Marcianus was an exercise in misdirection. They argue that that author of that work intended to refute any suggestion that Claudius might have been involved in a treasonable conspiracy against a legitimate Emperor, even one so contemptible as Gallienus, because he was, in fact, guilty of just that. They point out that this was a matter of present concern when the SHA were writing because Claudius was the proclaimed ancestor of the ruling Constantinian Dynasty. For these historians the very suggestion that Marcianus was actually present at Mediolanium is suspect given the silence of Zosimus and the grave state of affairs he would have had to leave behind him in Illyricum.Saunders(1991(126–7)) and Bray(1995:294) Potter takes no position in this controversy which is, of course, ultimately, incapable of resolution. Nevertheless, his general observation on the matter is highly apposite: > [...] while the sources are less than clear about the precise chain of > events, they are explicit on a single issue: that most of Gallienus's senior > officials wanted him dead.Potter(2004:264) If Marcianus shared the initial view of the army rank and file and dissented from this sentiment there is no reason to suppose that he attempted to thwart the conspiracy or ever contemplated taking vengeance on those involved. = A campaign in Asia = The ancient sources give no indication as to the role of Marcianus in the great war against the \\"Goths\\" and related barbarian peoples that culminated in the Roman victories at the Battle of Naissus and, afterwards, in the Balkan mountains – Haemus Mons. However, the inscriptions from Termessoss and Kibyra (epigraphic sources 2 and 3 above) suggest that he was associated with a campaign to clear the Eastern Mediterranean of \\"Gothic\\" pirates who had been ravaging the islands and the southern Anatolian coast since their original incursion from the Black Sea in 267 AD. Recent archeological and numismatic discoveries in this region (in particular the Sagalassos Inscription – see above – now seem to indicate that Imperial forces were active in this region in the reign of Claudius II. \\"Gothic\\" raids into the province of Pamphylia (modern Antalya) not only threatened communications between the European and the eastern provinces, but also put in danger the flow of corn and other produce from the Pisidian plateau at a time when Palmyrene activities in Egypt had made these all the more vital to Roman forces seeking to operate in the region. It is likely that the general disturbance caused by the Gothic pirates was also unsettling the peoples of Isauria in the central regions of Asia who the Romans had up to then been content to leave to their own devices. Under the High Empire responsibility for local policing and regional defence in the Asian provinces had been entrusted to the militias of the autonomous Greek cities of the region and there were no significant Imperial forces in this region. The central Asian provinces were defined as inermis (lit. \\"unarmed\\") insofar that it had never seemed necessary to station permanent garrisons of imperial troops. However, it would seem that by the latter part of Claudius's reign this arrangement was no longer adequate and increased intervention by the central government became necessary. Control of Termessos and Kibyra together with that of Sagalassos, a third city where evidence of activity at the time of Claudius II is particularly noted by Biagi, would have been key to the maintenance of Rome's strategic interests in the region. A landward thrust into this area would also have complemented the naval campaign undertaken, apparently at that time, by Tenagino Probus, the governor of AegyptusZos(1,37–46) Marcianus is likely to have arrived in the region accompanied by European troops and to have cooperated with the local police-forces. The inscriptions would suggest that he may have achieved his immediate objectives. (Zosimus asserts that the Gothic pirates: > ... did not achieve much... although, he gives Tenagino Probus, the commander of the naval operations, credit for this outcome). There is no evidence to suggest that Marcianus was still in the region when Zenobia of Palmyra launched her attempt to take control of the Asian provinces.  Final years  =Praeses Dalmatiae?= A number of factors make it tempting to identify the Marcianus of the literary record with \\"Aurelius Marcianus\\", the Vir Perfectissimus mentioned on the Salona Inscription as Praeses of Dalmatia under the Emperor Probus: *Their chronological proximity; *The coincidence of the names: \\"Marcianus\\" was not an uncommon cognomen, but *The very high rank (i.e. dux) and social status (i.e. vir perfectissimus) attributed to both these persons increases the likelihood that they were one and the same; and *The example of Publius Aelius Aelianus who was appointed Praeses of Mauretania Caesariensis by Probus some ten years after he was recorded as the equestrian commander of Leg. II Adiutrix in the mid-260s AD indicates that that prince would appoint seasoned military men to govern provinces where their professional expertise was likely to be required.Nagy(1965:305-7) Like Aelianus, the literary Marcianus certainly fulfils that criterion. Marcianus had had direct experience of campaigning in the mountains of Illyricum and would seem to have been well-suited to the task of governing a province as \\"difficult\\" as Dalmatia. Nevertheless, there has never been a secure identification of Marcianus with the Salona dedicatee made by an authoritative source so this possibility must presently be discounted for WP purposes. =Later career and death= There is no information whatsoever as to the final stages of Marcianus's career or to the date and circumstances of his death. =Heirs= Marcianus left no known heirs.

He is particularly remembered for his contributions to research in nuclear physics. Biography He was born at Drammen in Buskerud, Norway. He was the son of businessman Lauritz Dahl (1858-1932) and his wife Olga Sørensen. Dahl attended an evening technical school during his teenage years. In 1917, he was employed at Fenger Hagen, an electrical engineer with an interest in radio telephony. In 1921, Dahl was admitted as a student at the Army Flyvevæsens flight school at Kjeller in Skedsmo where he received an international pilot's license. Roald Amundsen hired him in 1922 as a pilot, mechanic, radio operator and cinematographer on an expedition in the Arctic Ocean in an effort to fly over the North Pole. After three test flight, the plane was wrecked in flight. However, Odd Dahl's research work made the expedition considered successful. He was later awarded the Order of St. Olav for his participation in the expedition. One of Dahl's main tasks were to take observations and maintain and construct instruments for the expedition's scientific director, Harald Sverdrup, who at the time was employed at The Carnegie Institution of Washington. Despite his very limited formal education, he recommended Dahl seek employment there after the expedition's end in 1925. After a year at the Carnegie Institution, he became involved in developing devices for high voltages for use in nuclear physics, an area where the United States at that time was lagging behind Europe. In 1926, together with Merle Tuve and Lawrence Hafstad, he constructed a Van de Graaf generator for the Carnegie Institution for Science. Ten years later he did the same for Chr. Michelsen Institute (CMI) in Bergen. In the early stages of CERN, Dahl was invited to participate and finally in 1952 to lead the Proton Synchrotron Group's work to which his contribution had a definitive role. Personal life Dahl was married twice. In 1927, he married Anna Augusta Selmer Mathiesen (1904-1959), daughter of Dr. Johan Berger Mathiesen (1872-1923) and Augusta Selmer (1878-1929). Per Dahl, who became a researcher in accelerator physics, was the son of Dahl and his wife Anna. In 1976, he married Elisa Margrethe Munck f. Anthonisen (b. 1903), daughter of consul Fredrik J.E. Anthonisen (1872-1963) and Marie Boe Christensen (1874-1936).

In 1861 he left to Boston, where he enlisted into the Union Army to fight in the American Civil War. The enlistment clerk wrote his profession as painter rather than printer when he signed up. This caused him to be changed from being an infantryman to becoming a combat engineer. =Wheeler Survey= After the war, Thompson went to Washington DC, where he became associated with the US Geological Survey. In 1872 he joined the Wheeler Survey, under Lieutenant George Wheeler. He would stay on the Wheeler survey for the next seven years, making friends with the likes of Henry Wetherbee Henshaw, Rogers Birnie, and William Henry Rideing.

It is best known for its eponymous Amrut brand of single malt whisky, which is the first single malt whisky to be made in India. The brand became famous after world famous whisky connoisseur Jim Murray gave it a rating of 82 out of 100 in 2005 and 2010. In 2010, Murray named Amrut Fusion single malt whisky as the third best in the world. John Hansell, editor of American magazine Whisky Advocate, wrote that \\"India's Amrut distillery changed the way many think of Indian whisky - that it was, in the past, just cheap Scotch whisky blended with who knows what and sold as Indian whisky. Amrut is making whisky, and it's very good\\". Despite the fame the company has received for the single malt whisky, it accounted for only 4-5% of the company's revenue in 2011-12. The bulk of its revenue comes from the sales of brandy, rum, vodka, gin and blended whisky, particularly the Silver Oak brandy, Old Port rum and Prestige whisky brands. Approximately 20% of its revenue comes from supplying the Canteen Stores Department. Amrut Distilleries currently sells Amrut single malt whisky in 23 countries, including Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Singapore, Spain, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the United States. History Founder JN Radhakrishna Rao Jagdale established a company called Amrut Laboratories in Bangalore, Karnataka in 1947, with an initial investment of a few hundred thousand rupees. Amrut is a Sanskrit word which can be translated as \\"nectar of the gods\\", \\"nectar of life\\", or \\"drink of the gods\\". The company translates it as \\"Elixir of Life\\". Following the liberalization of alcohol licensing laws, distillery licenses were easier to obtain. Jagdale took the opportunity to enter the liquor market by founding Amrut Distilleries Ltd in 1948. Today, Amrut Distilleries Ltd operates as a subsidiary of the N.R. Jagdale Group, an Indian industrial group, based in the city of Bangalore. The first plant was a liquor blending and bottling unit, specializing in Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL). The current main distillery was built in 1987. It is located on a site in Kambipura on Mysore Road, roughly 20 kilometres from Bangalore. Amrut Distilleries launched its first brand called Silver Cup brandy in Karnataka in 1949. The company began supplying liquor to the Canteen Stores Department in 1962 and continues to supply some of its domestic brands to the military. Radhakrishna Jagdale's son, Neelakanta Rao Jagdale, joined the family business in 1972. The higher standard of living that was becoming more prevalent in the country led to a higher demand for good quality liquor. Radhakrishna died in 1976, and his son assumed the role of chairman and managing director of the company. The company faced difficulties until the 1990s, as good equipment was not available locally. According to Neelakanta Jagdale, \\"The alcoholic beverages industry was not a priority in the country. Although we received help to a certain extent from the Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI), we had to find our own ways to learn about improved distilling methods\\". In 1982, Jagdale had decided to create a premium whisky from barley blended with malt, while most distillers in India were manufacturing whisky using molasses. Amrut Distilleries began using locally grown barley, in addition to molasses, and launched Prestige Blended Malt Whisky in the Canteen Stores Department in 1986. The first batch of single malt whisky was ready within 18 months. Because India had no culture of consuming single malt at the time, the company did not consider bottling it as a single malt. Instead, the whisky was blended with alcohol distilled from sugarcane to produce MaQintosh Premium Whisky. Initially, Amrut aged malt whisky for around a year before blending it. However, due to changing customer preferences, less malt whisky was being added into blended variants. The company discovered that hot weather makes whisky mature faster in India than it does in Europe or the United States. The fraction lost to evaporation during ageing, known as the angels' share, is also higher in India, at 11–12% per year, than in Scotland, where the annual evaporative loss is about 2%. Surinder Kumar, the master blender at Amrut Distilleries, has estimated that one year of barrel-ageing in India is equal to three years of ageing in Scotland. Jagdale felt that \\"the taste profiles were much better, almost matching some of the 12-year-old [Scotch] whiskies\\". The company then decided to launch their whisky in the European market. A bottle of Amrut Single Malt Whisky. In 2001, Neelakanta Rao Jagdale asked his son Rakshit Jagdale, who was pursuing an MBA course in Newcastle, England at the time, to investigate the potential of exporting their products to that country. Consultants Tatlock and Thomson Ltd of Scotland were hired to help hone the company's processes at their Bangalore distillery. Amrut Distilleries conducted blind tests of their single malt whisky in Scotland, where most consumers said they liked the drink and compared it to Speyside single malts. The whisky, under the brand name Amrut Single Malt Whisky, debuted in Europe on 24 August 2004. The company faced difficulties convincing European distributors and consumers to the try the product, as most believed that a good single malt could not be produced in India. According to head of international operations Ashok Chokalingam, the initial strategy of offering the product in restaurants was dropped, as \\"the resources needed are too high, both financial and human\\". They switched their focus to retailers and bars. Following the UK launch, the brand spread across Western Europe and the Scandinavian countries within two years. On 4 February 2010, Amrut Distilleries held a tasting session in Bangalore to launch their single malt whisky. The brand began retailing in Bangalore the same month. Domestically, it continued to be available only in Karnataka until November 2013 when it was launched in Mumbai. The company went with a Scottish launch for marketing reasons. According to Neelakanta Jagdale, \\"From a marketing perspective, we thought if our product had to pass the test, why not do so in the toughest location. Scotland is the home of Scotch. If they acknowledge our single malt, then that's good enough for me\\". The company also feels that \\"the high entry costs and complex excise laws in different states are a deterrent to further expansion in India\\". The brand was launched in North America in April 2010. Purple Valley Imports is its distributor in the United States. Production Amrut Distilleries began with a single blending and bottling unit, specializing in IMFL. Amrut's current main distillery was built in 1987. It is located in Kambipura on Mysore Road, roughly 20 kilometres from Bangalore. In addition to the original distillery, company also has a re-distillation plant to produce extra neutral alcohol for captive consumption and a bottling unit in Kerala. The company decided against using computers and automation in their distillery in favour of providing more jobs to people. The Bangalore distillery employs 450 people. Its distillery operation is highly labour- intensive and bottles are manually packed. Most of the staff at Amrut Distilleries involved in bottling and packaging are women. The distillery produces 4 million cases of liquor a year, of which about 25% are blended whisky and around 10,000 cases are single malt. The malt for the whisky is grown in regions Punjab and Rajasthan. The barley is transported for about 2500 km (1600 miles). Amrut Distilleries is headquartered in the Rajajinagar neighbourhood of Bangalore. Products Amrut Distilleries manufactures whisky (blended and single malt), brandy, rum, vodka and gin.\\"Products\\", Amrut Distilleries (website).

It entered the competition at the 2012 Locarno International Film Festival. Plot  Cosimo and Elia are two tilers from Rome commissioned by the singer Fausto Mieli to repaving the terrace of his house. A very successful singer, Fausto has chosen to retire from the stage following a serious illness of his wife Moira confined to a wheelchair. Despite the great displays of affection, it is clear that there is something wrong between Fausto and Moira. The couple lives withdrawn from the world in an apparently paradisiacal corner of the Tuscan-Emilian Apennines. To support tourism promotion, Fausto agreed to return to perform in public. Despite being brothers, Cosimo and Elia are profoundly different. The first, who is the older brother, has difficult stories behind him that have marked him deeply while the second, while loving his brother, suffers his presence as a limit. The small community immediately welcomes the two brothers with great distrust, like two foreigners. And if Elia tries to behave in an extremely professional manner, Cosimo cannot help but succumb to the charm of the star Fausto Mieli. Little by little, the mistrust between the two brothers and the rest of the village intensifies. Elia starts dating a local girl, triggering the jealousy of a boy who courts her. Cosimo, on the other hand, misunderstanding a compliment from Fausto, clashes with his client. To calm the ensuing humiliation he goes to the village bar and drinks more than he should. Meanwhile, as the day of the concert and Fausto's great return approaches, Elia and Cosimo's work is far from finished. Tensions between the singer and his immobilized wife escalate, just like the conflicts between the two brothers and the rest of the country. And when Cosimo involuntarily witnesses something that he shouldn't have seen, the reactions of the hosts are no longer delayed.

It can involve hatred, grievance, distrust, intimidation, fear, and hostility towards the Hungarian people, language and culture. History During the era of the Austro-Hungarian monarchs, the court in Vienna was influenced by Hungarophobia, but the Hungarian landowner nobles also showed signs of Germanophobia.Michael Hochedlinger, Austria's Wars of Emergence: War, State and Society in the Habsburg Monarchy, 1683-1797, Pearson Education, 2003, p. 25 In the 18th century, after the end of Rákóczi's War of Independence, many immigrants came to the underpopulated southern parts of the Kingdom of Hungary: for instance, 800 new German villages were established.Thomas Spira, German-Hungarian relations and the Swabian problem: from Károlyi to Gömbös, 1919-1936, East European quarterly, 1977, p. 2 The authorities preferred non-Hungarian settlers.

There were three Hungarian and/or Hungarian-centric political parties: * Hungarian-German Social Democratic Party * Hungarian National Party * Provincial Christian- Socialist Party After World War II, Czechoslovakia became a communist state; during the transition to a communist one-party state, decrees permitting the forced expulsion of German and Hungarian minorities from ethnic enclaves in Czechoslovakia came into effect, and Hungarians were forcibly relocated to Sudetenland, on the borders of Czechoslovakia.

In Slovakia, Hungarian and pro-Hungarian political parties are a stable part of the political system. Anti-Hungarian sentiment had been criticized particularly during the third government of Vladimír Mečiar. In the past, so-called \\"Hungarian card\\" had been used mainly by the Slovak National Party (SNS) against the granting of a special status to the Hungarian minority; it argued for the complete assimilation of the Hungarian minority into Slovak society. It considers that Hungarians in Slovakia are actually overprivileged.Hungarian Human Rights Foundation New Slovak Government Embraces Ultra-Nationalists, Excludes Hungarian Coalition Party After personnel changes in the presidium, SNS abandoned similar rhetoric and formed a common government with pro- Hungarian Most-Híd in 2016. Anti-Hungarian rhetoric of some far-right organizations in Slovakia is based on historical stereotypes and conflicts in the common history as interpreted from nationalistic positions and recent events. In such interpretations, the arrival of old Hungarian tribes is described as the occupation by barbarian tribes and contributed to the destruction of Great Moravia. Other negative sentiments are related to the period of Magyarization, the policy of interwar Hungary, the collaboration of Hungarian-minority parties with the Hungarian government against Czechoslovakia, the First Vienna Award and the Slovak–Hungarian War. Hungary is accused of still trying to undermine the territorial integrity of Slovakia, and local minority politicians are accused of irredentism. However, anti- Hungarian sentiment is not typical even for all far-right organisations, and the leader of the Slovak Brotherhood emphasized the need for collaboration with Hungarian far-right organisations against materialism and multiculturalism. Women, Slovak or not, used to be required to affix the Slovak feminine marker -ová (used for declension of feminine names) at the end of their surname. One incident of ethnically-motivated violence against Hungarians in Slovakia is the Hedvig Malina case. The 23-year-old Hungarian student from Horné Mýto was allegedly beaten and robbed in Nitra after speaking Hungarian in public. A football match in Dunajská Streda also caused tensions between Slovakia and Hungary when Hungarian fans were badly beaten by the Slovak police. The majority and the Hungarian minority describe their coexistence mostly as good. For example, in a public survey in 2015, 85.2% of respondents characterized their coexistence as good (63.6% rather good, 21.6% very good) and only 7.6% as bad (6.3% rather bad, 1.3% very bad). =Romania= In Romania, the Ceaușescu régime was obsessed with the ancient history of Transylvania The National Communism in Romania made the historical personalities of Hungary (such as John Hunyadi or György Dózsa)The Hungarian national component of the movement led by Dózsa was de-emphasized, while its strong antifeudal character was highlighted: Emanuel Copilaş, \\"Confiscarea lui Dumnezeu şi mecanismul inevitabilităţii istorice\\" , Sfera Politicii 139, September 2009 go through Romanianization and become more central figures in Romanian history.Lucian Boia, History and Myth in Romanian Consciousness, Central European University Press, 2001, p. 222 Citation:\\"....Thanks to the trios of Gelu, Glad and Menumorut, and Horea, Cloşca and Crişan, the Transylvanian heroes are actually more numerous than those of Wallachia or Moldavia, illustrating the obsession with Transylvania and the Hungarophobia that became accentuated towards the end of the Ceauşescu era.\\" Derogatory terms =In English= * Bohunk – combination of \\"Bohemian\\" and \\"Hungarian\\".

(sometimes Okay Hot-Shot) is a 1963 pop art painting by Roy Lichtenstein that uses his Ben-Day dots style and a text balloon. It is one of several examples of military art that Lichtenstein created between 1962 and 1964, including several with aeronautical themes like this one. It was inspired by panels from four different comic books that provide the sources for the plane, the pilot, the text balloon and the graphic onomatopoeia, \\"VOOMP!\\". Lichtenstein made several alterations to the source images as he compiled them into this composition. He used themes in this work that relate to those expressed in several of his other works. The narrative content is also said to relate to themes from other works, but instead of Lichtenstein's own works it relates to Jackson Pollock's contemporaneous works.  Background  During the late 1950s and early 1960s a number of American painters began to adapt the imagery and motifs of comic strips. Lichtenstein made drawings of comic strip characters in 1958. Andy Warhol produced his earliest paintings using this style in 1960. Lichtenstein, unaware of Warhol's work, produced Look Mickey and Popeye in 1961. Soon, Lichtenstein advanced from animated cartoons to more serious themes such as romance and combat depictions. Lichtenstein said that at the time, \\"I was very excited about, and very interested in, the highly emotional content yet detached impersonal handling of love, hate, war, etc., in these cartoon images.\\" The work was inspired by five different comic book panels made by Russ Heath and Irv Novick. The plane, the pilot, the text balloon and the graphic onomatopoeia, \\"VOOMP!\\", all come from panels from different comic books. Lichtenstein was a trained draftsman and artist. He also received training during World War II as an army pilot, but never saw active combat. His list of aeronautically themed works is extensive, including several others featuring pilots situated in cockpits during air combat such as Jet Pilot (1962), Brattata (1962), and Bratatat! (1963). Some sources list Okay Hot-Shot, Okay! along with Whaam! and Blam as Lichtenstein's best-known examples of military art. Okay Hot-Shot, Okay! is one of several comics-based works, including Jet Pilot and Von Karp, inspired by the World War II U.S. fighter pilot Johnny Cloud of DC Comics' The Losers. The January–February 1962 DC Comics' All-American Men of War issue #89 was the inspiration for several Lichtenstein paintings, providing two of the source panels of Okay Hot-Shot, Okay! as well as sources for Brattata, Blam, Whaam! and Tex! The graphite pencil sketch, Jet Pilot was also from that issue.  Critical appraisal  In the source, the pilot wore traditional World War II headgear, but Lichtenstein altered the headgear to that of a cosmonaut, astronaut or modern air force pilot of the Cold War era. Lichtenstein also shifted the subject so that his left iris is in the frame. The work also is related to Lichtenstein's theme of \\"machine and embodied vision\\" as exhibited in works such as Crak!, Bratatat!, and Jet Pilot. The narrative content, \\"Okay, hot-shot, okay! I'm pouring! [ammunition into the enemy]\\" is said to have a dual meaning that alludes to the style of poured painting being made famous at the time by Pollock. Melodrama through heightened tension ties this with some of Lichtenstein's most notable works. While melding the elements and motifs of panels from two artists, Lichtenstein simplified the hatching and use of color. In Lichtenstein's obituary, Los Angeles Times critic Christopher Knight said the use of color in this work harkened back to works by Morris Louis and the explosion's graphic elements recalled Kenneth Noland's target work. In an account published in 1998 after Lichtenstein was famous, Irv Novick said that he met Lichtenstein in the army in 1947 and, as his superior officer, had responded to Lichtenstein's tearful complaints about the menial tasks he was assigned by recommending him for a better job. Jean-Paul Gabilliet has questioned this account, saying that Lichtenstein had left the army a year before the time Novick says the incident took place. Bart Beaty, noting that Lichtenstein had appropriated Novick for works such as Whaam! and Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!, says that Novick's story \\"seems to be an attempt to personally diminish\\" the more famous artist.

Croatia's EU membership obliges it to eventually join the eurozone . Prior to Croatian entry to the EU on 1 July 2013, Boris Vujčić, governor of the Croatian National Bank, stated that he would like the kuna to be replaced by the euro as soon as possible after accession. This must be at least two years after Croatia joins the ERM2 (in addition to it meeting other criteria). Croatia joined the ERM II on 10 July 2020.

Subsequent convergence reports published in June 2016, May 2018 and June 2020 came to the same conclusions. Target date for euro adoption When you ain’t got nothing, you got nothing to lose’. If you don’t have independent monetary policy what are you going to lose by entering into the monetary union?'' —Boris Vujčić, Governor of the Croatian National Bank, makes an analogy about Croatia's long-held euro-focused monetary policy. Croatia's EU membership obliges it to eventually join the eurozone. Prior to Croatian entry to the EU on 1 July 2013, Boris Vujčić, governor of the Croatian National Bank, stated that he would like the kuna to be replaced by the euro as soon as possible after accession. This must be at least two years after Croatia joins the ERM2 (in addition to it meeting other criteria). The Croatian National Bank had anticipated euro adoption within two or three years of EU entry. However, the EU's response to the financial crises in eurozone delayed Croatia's adoption of the euro. The country's own contracting economy also poses a major challenge to it meeting the convergence criteria. While keen on euro adoption, one month before Croatia's EU entry governor Vujčić admitted \\"...we have no date [to join the single currency] in mind at the moment\\". The European Central Bank was expecting Croatia to be approved for ERM II membership in 2016 at the earliest, with euro adoption in 2019. In April 2015, President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović stated in a Bloomberg interview she was \\"confident that Croatia would introduce the euro by 2020\\", while Prime Minister Zoran Milanović said at the government session that \\"some occasional announcements when Croatia will introduce the euro shouldn't be taken seriously. We'll try to make it as soon as possible, but I distance myself from any dates and ask that you don't comment on it. When the country is ready, it will enter the euro area. The criteria are very clear.\\" In November 2017, Prime Minister Andrej Plenković said that Croatia is aiming to join ERM-2 by 2020 and to introduce the Euro by 2025. Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, stated in June 2019 that \\"Croatia is ready to join the ERM-2\\". A letter of intent of joining the ERM II mechanism was sent on 5 July 2019 to the ECB, signed by Minister of Finance Zdravko Marić, and the governor of the Croatian National Bank Boris Vujčić. The letter marks the first formal step towards the adoption of the euro. Croatia committed to joining the Banking union as part of its efforts to join ERM II. On 23 November 2019, European Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said that Croatia could join ERM II in the second half of 2020. Croatia joined the ERM2 on 10 July 2020.

TheBacklot was dissolved in June 2015. History TheBacklot was originally known under the name AfterElton and was founded by Sarah Warn, Michael Jensen, and Brent Hartinger. Warn initially served as Editor in Chief of both AfterElton and AfterEllen. Jensen became Editor in Chief of AfterElton in November 2005 and served in the position until September 25, 2011. Dennis Ayers, formerly the site's managing editor, took over as Editor in Chief. The site was not affiliated with Elton John, although its original name refers to the milestone for gay men when John publicly came out. The site featured television, film, music, books, and celebrity news. It published articles, regular columns, reviews, recaps of television shows with gay and bisexual characters, and maintained several blogs, including the \\"Meme\\" by Ed Kennedy.AfterElton Morning Meme AfterElton (along with AfterEllen) was acquired by cable television channel Logo in 2006. On January 12, 2012, the site announced that Louis Virtel had been hired as its West Coast entertainment editor. On January 31, 2013, Dennis Ayers announced that AfterElton would be changing its name to TheBacklot.com in April. The change was motivated by a desire to separate the website from its \\"AfterEllen's little brother\\" origin and to reflect the general \\"focus on Hollywood and the film and television industry\\". The relaunch under the new name took place on April 17, 2013. On June 29, 2015, Ayers announced that the TheBacklot was merging with NewNowNext, an LGBT-themed entertainment website owned by Logo.

Background The source of Bratatat! is All-American Men of War #90 © March–April 1962, National Periodical Publications (DC). Lichtenstein was a trained United States Army pilot, draftsman and artist as well as a World War II veteran who never saw active combat. His list of aeronautical themed works is extensive. Within that genre, Lichtenstein has produced several works featuring pilots situated in cockpits during air combat such as Jet Pilot (1962), Brattata (1962), Bratatat! (1963), and Okay Hot-Shot, Okay! (1963). Bratatat! along with Whaam! and Varoom! are among Lichtenstein's most recognizable onomatopoeic works. The source of Bratatat! is All-American Men of War #90 (March–April 1962, DC Comics). Bratatat! depicts a jet fighter pilot engaged in military conflict. The black and white sketch of this work has been on a worldwide tour, accompanied by DC Comics artwork. The painting is symbolic of Lichtenstein's portfolio of work and is widely celebrated, as much for the name as for the actual graphical content of military conflict, in the marketing of the artist and his works. Critical response The work addresses Lichtenstein's motif of monocularity by pitting the pilot's binocular vision against the technologically advanced monocular computing reflector gun sight. The Washingtonian's critic Sophie Gilbert regards Bratatat! (along with Takka Takka) as exemplary of Lichtenstein's \\"aggressive, hyper-masculine war paintings\\" because of its depiction of the guns creating sound effects and the use of onomatopoeic words during military conflict. Dramatic close-ups of male protagonists at war, such as Bratatat! and Torpedo...Los!, serve as counterpoints to Lichtenstein's women in clichéd romantic turmoil during highly-charged moments. The work also is related to Lichtenstein's theme of \\"machine and embodied vision\\" as exhibited in works such as Crak!, Okay Hot- Shot, Okay!, and Jet Pilot.

He moved to Berlin soon after, played second violin in Ferdinand Laub's quartet, and gave many successful concerts. He was made royal Kapellmeister in 1871, and in 1891 succeeded Haupt as director of the Royal Institute for Church Music.

The work is held in the collection at the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art. It is one of several Lichtenstein works from All-American Men of War issue #89, but is a reworking of its source panel.  Background  The source of Brattata is All-American Men of War #89 (j), January–February 1962, National Periodical Publications Inc. (DC). According to the University of Michigan Library, at one time the work was held in the Fischmann collection. St. Louis businessman and financeer, Milton Fischmann died in May 1974, and the work is now in the collection of the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art. A trained draftsman and artist, Lichtenstein was a United States Army pilot who served in World War II without ever seeing active combat. His list of aeronautical themed works is extensive. Within that genre, Lichtenstein has featured pilots situated in cockpits during air combat in many of his works, such as Jet Pilot (1962), Brattata (1962), Bratatat! (1963), and Okay Hot-Shot, Okay! (1963). The source of Brattata is All-American Men of War #89 (January–February 1962, DC Comics). The same issue was the inspiration for several other Lichtenstein paintings, Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!, Blam, Whaam! and Tex! The graphite pencil sketch, Jet Pilot was also from that issue. The pilot's mask is unbuckled, revealing the lower half of his face (as opposed to Bratatat! and Jet Pilot where only the eyes are visible). The onomatopoeia presented graphically appears as a cliché. In comparison to the original Lichtenstein increased the required number of downed planes for flying ace recognition by two, possibly reflecting his own training.  Critical appraisal  Lichtenstein in 1967 The work is among those known for \\"bursting shapes and colors\\" in its graphical content and excellent sound and action in its narrative content. It is one of several Lichtenstein works that depicts what one author describes as a \\"male violence fantasy\\".

She was noted in particular for her work with Franz Heritsch and with her husband, Franz Kahler. In recognition of her discovery of graptolites in the northern greywacke zone, her former fellow student, Ida Peltzmann, named two species for her. Life and career Gustava Aigner was born on 29 April 1906 in Salzburg. Her parents were Gustav Aigner, a lawyer, and Maria, née Melbler. She was educated at the Mädchen-Reform- Realgymnasium and then studied geology, paleontology, mineralogy and petrography at the University of Graz. She was only the second woman to study geology at an Austrian university. She earned her PhD in July 1929, when she was only 23 years old, with a dissertation entitled \\"Die Productiden des Karbons von Nötsch im Gailtal\\". Her dissertation was the first to reflect a redirection of study in the field away from mineralogy and crystallography and towards stratigraphy and palaeontology. She then taught for five years at the Realgymnasium for girls in Salzburg. She had originally planned to study botany; her interest in geology was sparked by Franz Heritsch, and in 1935 she married the banker Franz Kahler, a fellow geology student of Heritsch's who had completed his doctorate in 1931. Kahler worked as a geologist in Klagenfurt, in Norway and finally in Carinthia, where he was appointed state geologist in 1947. She co-authored many papers both with Heritsch and with her husband, whom she assisted in a systematic study of the Fusulinida. Their study and publications covered the Late Palaeozoic stratigraphy of the Carnic Alps. In 1937, Aigner and Kahler subdivided the genus Pseudoschwagerina into five subgroups; they then proposed a subgeneric name, Zellia for one of the groups. After the end of World War II in 1945, she and her husband restarted their career and established links with the world. In June 1979, the University of Graz ceremonially renewed her doctorate and she was presented the Badge of Honour by the Association of academics. In June 1980, the Verband der Akademikerinnen (Association of Women Scholars) honoured her. In recognition of her having made the first discovery of graptolites in the northern Greywacke zone, her former fellow student, Ida Peltzmann, named two species for her. Gustava Kahler-Aigner had three daughters; her first daughter was born in 1937. She underwent three serious operations and died on 22 March 1987 after a long illness.

Like many of Lichtenstein's works from this time period, it was inspired by a comic book image, but he made notable modifications of the source in his work.  Background  The source of Jet Pilot was All American Men of War #89 (l), January–February 1962, National Periodical Publications (DC) In the mid-1970s the work was owned by Richard Brown Baker, who had acquired the work in May 1963. As of 2013 it is owned by the Yale University Art Gallery, which also hosts the related work Blam. Lichtenstein was a trained United States Army pilot, draftsman and artist as well as a World War II (WWII) veteran who never saw active combat. His list of aeronautical themed works is extensive. Within that genre, Lichtenstein has produced several works featuring pilots situated in cockpits during air combat such as Jet Pilot (1962), Brattata (1962), Bratatat! (1963), and Okay Hot-Shot, Okay! (1963). Jet Pilot is one of several drawings that Lichtenstein has done in a frottage technique, in a time before he routinely used the Ben-Day dots for which he is better known. This work has been on a worldwide tour of Lichtenstein's 1961-68 black-and-white sketches, accompanied by DC Comics artwork. The source of Jet Pilot was All American Men of War #89 (January–February 1962, DC Comics). Jet Pilot is one of several comics-based works, including Okay Hot-Shot, Okay! and Von Karp, inspired by the World War II Navajo U.S. Air Force fighter pilot Johnny Cloud of DC Comics' The Losers. The same All American Men of War issue was the inspiration for several other Lichtenstein paintings, Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!, Brattata, Blam, Whaam! and Tex!  Critical appraisal  Lichtenstein usually simplified from his source material, but in Jet Pilot the gun sight is more detailed than in the source. In Lichtenstein's image the line of enemy bullets follows a different path, thereby reducing the suspense caused in the source as the bullets ruptured the pilot's air hose. The work also is related to Lichtenstein's theme of \\"machine and embodied vision\\" as exhibited in works such as Crak!, Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!, and Bratatat!.

The establishment was triggered by the temporary closing of the London bullion market which marked the collapse of the London Gold Pool, a system of maintaining the Bretton Woods System of fixed-rate convertible currencies and defending a gold price of US$35 per troy ounce by interventions in the London market. The consequences of the collapse of the London Gold Pool, such as the closing of the London bullion market, caused significant instability in the trading and valuation of gold. Without a market, the South African gold producers sought alternative trading partners. The accompanied weakness of the British pound ended the world dominance of London as the major exchange of gold bullion. Swiss banks acted immediately to minimize effects on the Swiss banking system and its currency. By informal agreements between Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS), Swiss Bank Corporation, and Credit Suisse, these banks established a gold trading arrangement, the Zürich Gold Pool. The pool, especially UBS, immediately became the major financial partner of the South African suppliers. Having no indigenous national gold supplies, the Swiss gold market in Zürich developed and maintained a dominance in gold bullion trading by offering specialized account and banking services based on the country's confidentiality laws for banking. By the 1970s Zürich was established as the major trading location for gold, trading some 70% of the worlds total production of gold.

Due to security problems, turnout was less than half that of the 2009 election. This election saw Sunni Arab parties lose a number of seats to minority parties.  Background  Nineveh is one of Iraq's most demographically-diverse governorates. Out of a population of about 2.8 million, 2013 estimates cited by Niqash claim about 300,000 Turkmen, (primarily in Tal Afar and Rashidiya. A similarly-sized population of Yazidis live in the districts of Shekhan and Sinjar and near the town of Bashiqa. Some 250,000 Shabaks live in villages north and east of Mosul, and 200,000 Christians live in Bashiqa, Bartella and Bakhdida. There is a sizable Kurdish population, with many Yazidis also identifying as Kurds. Although elections for 13 of Iraq's 18 governorates were held on 20 April, elections in Al Anbar and Nineveh were delayed due to security concerns in the ongoing insurgency and Sunni-led protests.  Violence  As of 14 June there were eight attacks on provincial-council candidates in Nineveh, resulting in six deaths (including Muhanad Ghazi, a Sunni Arab candidate for the Iraqi Republican Gathering—a party supporting Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki). Ghazi was shot dead by unknown gunmen whilst walking home from the East Mosul mosque. Another local politician, Younis al-Rammah (leader of the moderate United Iraqi Gathering party), was killed on 19 June—the day before the election. Rammah was hosting a family gathering at a residence in Hadhar when a man embraced him, detonating a suicide vest and killing Rammah and four relatives. No group claimed responsibility for the attack, although Iraqi officials blamed it on attempts by the Islamic State of Iraq to disrupt the political process and return to sectarian violence. There was also violence on election day, with four Iraqi soldiers wounded by mortar rounds and roadside bombs in the Mosul area.  Results   Analysis  The Uniters List, composed of al-Hadba and the Iraqi Islamic Party, had won 49.82 percent of the vote and 22 of 37 seats in the Nineveh Governorate Council in 2009. The party held eight of 39 council seats after the 2013 election. The local Arab parties lost control of the council, although Atheel al-Nujaifi remained governor. The new council president was Bashar Kiki, a Kurd; the new vice-president, Nour ad-Din Qabalan, was a Turkmen. Nujaifi's deputy, Abdul Qader Battoush, is also Kurdish. His second deputy, Hassan al-Allaf, is an Arab and one of three politicians elected from Mosul (which had produced a large number of Arab politicians in the previous election). According to local political scientist Hamza Hussein, the number of seats won by minorities demonstrated popular discontent and lack of confidence in the previous council. Local activist Rabea Mustafa said that opposition to the previous council arose largely from resentment of its fractured nature, which hampered its ability to deliver basic services. Mustafa also said that the election result was due to minorities being driven out of Mosul because of violence; these minorities then settled elsewhere in Nineveh. Voter turnout in Mosul was low, due to security problems and a lack of confidence in the political process and the previous council. Candidates were better able to canvass outside Mosul due to better security, and many Mosul-based candidates withdrew from the election. Voter turnout was about half that of 2009: 581,449, compared to 995,169 in the previous election.

Synopsis The Moderna technology platform is to insert synthetic mRNA into living cells that would reprogram the cells to develop immune responses, rather than being created externally and injected as with conventional medicines. It is a novel technique abandoned by several large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that were unable to overcome the side effects of inserting RNA into cells. , no mRNA drug has been approved for human use. Moderna has conducted mostly unsuccessful trials in traditional high-margin chronic therapeutic areas with AstraZeneca, and in orphan diseases with Alexion Pharmaceuticals. In 2014, Moderna moved to focus on lower-margin vaccines, given that an mRNA vaccine – efficacy issues aside – will always stimulate a level of antibody development in subjects. The strategic change led industry experts, and Moderna employees, to question the financial viability of the company. In the opinion of some former Moderna employees, the safe dose was too weak and \\"repeat injections of a dose strong enough to be effective had troubling effects on the liver in animal studies.\\" In December 2018, Moderna became the largest biotech initial public offering (IPO) in history, raising US$600 million for 8% of its shares, implying an overall valuation of $7.5 billion, and with cumulative losses of $1.5 billion and equity raised of $3.2 billion, since inception. As of May 2020, Moderna was valued at $30 billion, but none of its mRNA molecules had reached large clinical trials, and several had failed due to side-effects. In July 2020, Moderna announced in a preliminary report that its Operation Warp Speed candidate had led to production of neutralizing antibodies in healthy adults in Phase 1 clinical testing. \\"At the 100-microgram dose, the one Moderna is advancing into larger trials, all 15 patients experienced side effects, including fatigue, chills, headache, muscle pain, and pain at the site of injection.\\" The troublesome higher doses were discarded in July from future studies. History =2010–2016= In 2010, ModeRNA Therapeutics was formed to commercialize the research of stem cell biologist Derrick Rossi, who developed a method for modifying mRNA, transfecting it into human cells, then dedifferentiating it into stem cells that could then be further redifferentiated into desired target cell types. Rossi approached fellow Harvard University faculty member Tim Springer, who called on Kenneth Chien, Bob Langer, and venture capital firm Flagship Ventures, to co-invest. In 2011, the CEO of Flagship Ventures (now Flagship Pioneering), Noubar Afeyan, brought in European pharma sales and operations executive Stéphane Bancel as CEO. Afeyan personally owned 19.5% of Moderna and was the largest single shareholder, while his fund, Flagship Pioneering, owned 18%. In March 2013, Moderna and AstraZeneca signed a five-year exclusive option agreement to discover, develop, and commercialize mRNA for treatments in the thereputic areas of cardiovascular, metabolic and renal diseases, and selected targets for cancer. The agreement included a $240 million upfront payment to Moderna, a payment that was \\"one of the largest ever initial payments in a pharmaceutical industry licensing deal that does not involve a drug already being tested in clinical trials\\", and an 8% share in Moderna. , only one candidate has passed Phase 1 trials, a treatment for myocardial ischemia, labelled AZD8601. In January 2014, Moderna and Alexion Pharmaceuticals entered a $125 million deal for orphan diseases in need of therapies. Alexion paid Moderna $100 million for 10 product options to develop rare-disease treatments, including for Crigler-Najjar syndrome, using Moderna's mRNA therapeutics platform By 2016, Bancel told an audience of JPMorgan Chase investors that the work with Alexion would shortly enter human trials. However, by 2017, the program with Alexion had been scrapped as the animal trials showed that Moderna's treatment would never be safe enough for use in humans. In 2014, after disappointing standalone therapeutic trials, Moderna moved to focus on mRNA vaccines given that, efficacy issues aside, mRNA will always stimulate a level of antibody development in subjects. The change in strategy had risk given the materially lower margins of vaccine development (called \\"loss-leaders\\" by some Moderna employees), with some senior employees and industry experts questioning the future viability of the company. Rossi left the company. In February 2016, an op-ed in Nature, criticized Moderna for not publishing any peer-reviewed papers on its technology, unlike most other emerging and established biotech companies, and compared its approach to that of the controversially failed Theranos. In September 2018, Thrillist published article titled, \\"Why This Secretive Tech Start-Up Could Be The Next Theranos\\", criticizing its reputation for secrecy and the absence of scientific validation or independent peer-review of its research, though having the highest valuation of any U.S. private biotech company at more than $5 billion. A former Moderna scientist told Stat: \\"It's a case of the emperor's new clothes. They're running an investment firm, and then hopefully it also develops a drug that's successful\\". =2018–2020= In 2018 the company rebranded as \\"Moderna Inc.\\" with the ticker symbol MRNA, and further increased its portfolio of vaccine development. In December 2018, Moderna became the largest biotech initial public offering in history, raising $621 million (27 million shares at $23 per share) on the NASDAQ, and implying an overall valuation of $7.5 billion for the entire company. The year-end 2019 SEC filings showed that Moderna had accumulated losses of $1.5 billion since inception, with a loss of $514 million in 2019 alone, and had raised $3.2 billion in equity since 2010. In March 2020, in a White House meeting between the Trump Administration and pharmaceutical executives, Bancel told the President that Moderna could have a COVID-19 vaccine ready in a few months. The next day, the FDA approved clinical trials for the Moderna vaccine candidate, with Moderna later receiving investment of $483 million from Operation Warp Speed. Moderna board member, Moncef Slaoui, was appointed head scientist for the Operation Warp Speed project.  Leadership  =Executive= Since 2011, Moderna has been led by CEO Stéphane Bancel, a French businessman who has a pharmaceutical sales and operations background. Bancel has been described as having a secretive approach to Moderna, and of being a tough operator. Though never having worked with RNA before, Stat noted that Bancel \\"is listed as a co-inventor on more than 100 of Moderna's early patent applications, unusual for a CEO who is not a PhD scientist\\". After Noubar Afeyan and Robert Langer, Bancel is the largest individual shareholder in the company. Stephen Hoge, M.D., is President and a former McKinsey & Company management consultant who joined in 2012; he is the fourth-largest individual shareholder in the company. David Meline is CFO.  Stock sales  On 18 May 2020, when Moderna announced it was making progress with its coronavirus vaccine, company stock rose 30%. That day, CFO Lorence Kim bought stock for $3 million and immediately sold it for $19.8 million. The next day, chief medical officer Tal Zaks bought stock for $1.5 million and immediately sold it for $9.77 million. Both of these executives were using automated insider trading plans known as 10b5-1 plans. On 21 and 22 May, Moderna's leading shareholder, the venture capital firm Flagship Pioneering, made $69.5 million by selling Moderna stock. Flagship is listed as a Moderna \\"insider\\" but did not use an automated 10b5-1 plan for these sales. =Board= Since 2011, the Chairman of Moderna has been the CEO of Flagship Pioneering, businessman Noubar Afeyan. Afeyan who has a Ph.D. in biochemical engineering holds his interest in Moderna through various Flagship Pioneering vehicles, however, at the 2018 IPO, documents filed stated that Afeyan owned 19.5% of the company, while Flagship owned 18%, thus giving Afeyan control over 37.5% of the company. In May 2020, board member Dr. Moncef Slaoui resigned from the company to become Chief Scientist for the Trump administration's \\"Operation Warp Speed\\", a group designed to accelerate the development of a vaccine for the coronavirus. Slaoui continued to hold more than $10 million in stock options in the company in his new role while the Federal government invested $483 million in the company to assist in coronavirus vaccine trials. Senator Elizabeth Warren called the holding a conflict of interest and that Slaoui should have divested his options. Platform Moderna develops mRNAs that are delivered in lipid nanoparticle, using mRNA with pseudouridine nucleosides. Candidates are designed to have improved folding and translation efficiency via insertional mutagenesis. , no RNA (or RNA vaccine) has been licensed for prophylactic use in humans, however mRNA-1273 at low doses has been shown in the preliminary report on a Phase I trial to be immunogenic in a small number of volunteers aged 18-55 years. More than one in five \\"participants in the 250-μg dose group reported one or more severe adverse events,\\" and mRNA-1273 induced transient urticaria in both legs to one patient who was given a very low dose. =COVID-19 vaccine= In January 2020, Moderna announced development of a vaccine (named mRNA-1273) to induce immunity to SARS-CoV-2, in competition with other biotechnology companies, such as Gilead Sciences, Vaxart, Inovio Pharmaceuticals, and Novavax. Moderna's technology is a messenger RNA (mRNA) compound named mRNA-1273, which induces immunity to SARS- CoV-2 by encoding a prefusion stabilized spike (S) protein naturally present on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 particles. From the announcement, Moderna's shares rose dramatically, and the CEO and other corporate executives began large program sales of their shareholdings. In March 2020, the Phase I human study of the vaccine candidate began in partnership with the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. In April, the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) allocated up to $483 million for Moderna's vaccine development. Plans for a Phase II dosing and efficacy trial to begin in May were approved by the FDA. In preparation for future manufacturing, should the vaccine be approved, Moderna signed a partnership with Swiss vaccine producer, Lonza Group. It is intended to supply 300 million doses annually from Lonza Visp for ROWSwiss factory rushes to prepare for Moderna Covid-19 vaccine. In May 2020, after releasing partial and non-peer reviewed results for only 8 of 45 candidates in a preliminary pre- Phase 1 stage human trial direct to stock markets, the CEO announced on CNBC an immediate $1.25 billion rights issue to raise funds for the company, at a $30 billion valuation. Former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb tempered the CNBC audience by saying that there would be a \\"long road ahead for Moderna\\". The Wall Street Journal followed up with \\"Be Careful Handling White-Hot Moderna Stock\\", while Stat said, \\"Vaccine experts say Moderna didn't produce data critical to assessing Covid-19 vaccine\\". William A. Haseltine in a Washington Post opinion piece called it: \\"publication by press release\\". On May 25 2020, Moderna began a Phase IIa clinical trial recruiting 600 adult participants to assess safety and differences in antibody response to two doses of its candidate vaccine, mRNA-1273, a study expected to complete in 2021. On July 7, Reuters reported fights between Moderna and government scientists over the company's unwillingness to share data from the clinical trials or to follow all the steps requested by the government. On July 9, Moderna announced an in-fill manufacturing deal with Laboratorios Farmacéuticos Rovi, in the event that its vaccine is approved. On 14 July 2020, Moderna scientists published preliminary results of the Phase I dose escalation clinical trial of mRNA-1273, showing dose-dependent induction of neutralizing antibodies against S1/S2 as early as 15 days post-injection. Mild to moderate adverse reactions, such as fever, fatigue, headache, muscle ache, and pain at the injection site were observed in all dose groups, but were common with increased dosage. The vaccine in low doses was deemed safe and effective in order to advance a Phase III clinical trial using two 100-μg doses administered 29 days apart. Moderna and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases began a Phase III trial in the United States on 27 July with a plan to enroll and assign 30,000 volunteers to two groups — one group receiving two 100-μg doses of mRNA-1273 vaccine and the other receiving 0.9% Sodium Chloride. As of 7 August, over 4,500 volunteers had enrolled. According to the Financial Times, Moderna planned to price its vaccine between $50-60 per course. On 11 August 2020, President Trump announced that the United States, as part of Operation Warp Speed, had signed an agreement to buy 100 million doses of Moderna's anticipated vaccine. In September 2020, Moderna published the detailed study plan for the clinical trial. On 30 September, CEO Stéphane Bancel said that, if the trial is successful, the vaccine might be available to the public as early as late March or early April 2021.

Background  150px In the early- and mid-1960s Lichtenstein produced several of his most notable works, many with themes of war or romance, but others with themes of explosions or brushstrokes. Several of Lichtenstein's large-scale depictions of explosions, such as Varoom! are iconic. Varoom! along with Whaam! and Bratatat! are among Lichtenstein's most recognizable onomatopoeic works and was in a sense part of Lichtenstein's response to action painting. Lichtenstein's list of aeronautically themed works is extensive. Varoom! is an explosion that is regarded as part of that theme. Varoom!, which depicts an instantaneous explosion, is composed of the primary colors presented over a light dotted background. Black and white specs add crackle to the composition. The block-lettered text, \\"VAROOM!\\", stands out, giving a title to the shattering event. In 1964, this painting served as the basis for the beginning of Lichtenstein's sculptural efforts, when he produced an enameled steel work that extended his theme of flatness. In 1965, he extended this theme to ceramic art. Lichtenstein also created another painting entitled Varoom (no exclamation point, 1965).  Critical appraisal  Varoom, which spews action and drama, is based on the \\"visual language of comics\\", unlike the romance and war comic-based work that focuses more on the narrative than the graphic details as this work does.

In the spring and summer of 1715 a series of riots occurred in England in which High Church mobs attacked over forty Dissenting meeting-houses.Nicholas Rogers, ‘Riot and Popular Jacobitism in Early Hanoverian England’, in Eveline Cruickshanks (ed.), Ideology and Conspiracy: Aspects of Jacobitism, 1689-1759 (Edinburgh: John Donald, 1982), p. 70.Paul Kleber Monod, Jacobitism and the English People, 1688–1788 (Cambridge University Press, 1993), p. 191. The rioters also protested against the first Hanoverian king of Britain, George I and his new Whig government (the Whigs were associated with the Dissenters).Rogers, p. 78, p. 81. The riots occurred on symbolic days: 28 May was George I's birthday, 29 May was the anniversary of Charles II's Restoration and 10 June was the birthday of the Jacobite Pretender, James Francis Edward Stuart. Background Upon the death in August 1714 of the last Stuart monarch, Queen Anne, Georg Ludwig, Elector of Hanover, ascended the throne in accordance with the terms of the Act of Settlement 1701 that excluded Anne's half-brother James Francis Edward Stuart. After his arrival in Britain in September, George promptly dismissed the Tories from office and appointed a Whig-dominated government. His coronation in October led to rioting in over twenty towns in England.Monod, pp. 173-78. The 1715 general election was also accompanied by riots and resulted in a Whig majority in the House of Commons and the proscription of the Tories from office, with some former Tory ministers being impeached by the new government. According to Nicholas Rogers, the High Church clergy of the Church of England played a role in fomenting discontent: they were \\"by reputation the progenitors of mob violence\\" and after George's accession the \\"high-flying clergy strove desperately to revive the flagging fortunes of their party, mobilising their congregations in defence of the Anglican inheritance and warning them of the dangers of Whig rule\\".Rogers, pp. 72–73. The Whig writer Daniel Defoe complained that the pulpit had become \\"a Trumpet of Sedition\\".Rogers, p. 72. Riots The anniversary of Queen Anne's accession day and William III's death, 8 March, was met in London with bell- ringing, flag-waving and closed shops. On 23 April, the anniversary of Anne's coronation, a mob met at Snow Hill and made a bonfire under a banner depicting Anne and emblazoned with the words: “Imitate her who was so Just and Good, / Both in her Actions and her Royal Word” (the latter may have hinted at her supposed promise to restore James Stuart to the throne). Near St Andrew's, Holborn, the mob burned a picture of William III and broke windows which were not illuminated in celebration. Referring to the 1710 Sacheverell riots, they also proposed \\"to sing the Second Part of the Sacheverell-Tune by pulling down [Dissenting] Meeting Houses\\" but they were persuaded not to do so.Monod, pp. 180-81. James Francis Edward Stuart by Alexis Simon Belle. The first riots happened in London during the impeachment trials of Tory politicians. On 29 April the birthday of the Tory peer the Duke of Ormonde was riotously celebrated in Drury Lane and west London.Rogers, p. 76. On George I's birthday, 28 May, there occurred large demonstrations in Smithfield, Cheapside and Highgate, where the Dissenting chapel was attacked.Rogers, p. 76. In Smithfield, according to Abel Boyer, \\"a large mob burnt Cromwell (some say Hoadly) in effigy\\".Monod, p. 181. In Cheapside the rioters shouted “No Hanoverian, No Presbiterian government”. The next day was Restoration Day and the mob shouted: “A Restoration, a Stewart, High Church and Ormonde”, “A Stewart, a second Restoration” and “No King George, King James the third”. When a coachman called for King James he \\"was hollowed through the Mob\\" and supporters of the Whigs had their windows broken. In Queen Street a battle occurred between the rioters and the trained bands. At the London Stock Exchange the crowd shouted “High Church and the Duke of Ormonde”. Stock jobbing was seen as the parasitical and immoral growth from Whig principles. When one passer-by shouted “Long live King George” he was beaten up by the mob. In Oxford on 28 May a rumour spread that Queen Anne, Lord Bolingbroke, Ormonde and Henry Sacheverell were to be burned in effigy. In response, undergraduates and townsfolk attacked those celebrating George's birthday and broke into the Presbyterian meeting-house and made a bonfire of its pulpit, pews and window, with an effigy of its minister. The mob chanted “An Ormond, an Ormond, a Bolingbroke, down with the Roundheads, no Constitutioners [members of the Whig Constitutional Club], no Hanover; a new Restoration”. The next day a Quaker and Baptist meeting place was also attacked.Monod, p. 182.Rogers, pp. 76-77. On 10 June Anglican churches in Clerkenwell and St Dunstan-in-the-West rang their bells to celebrate James Stuart's birthday, a Dissenting meeting place in Blackfriars was gutted by the mob, and James's declaration was nailed to the door of the former Dissenting chapel in Lincoln's Inn Fields (which had been destroyed five years previously during the Sacheverell riots). Similar disturbances on James's birthday occurred at Cambridge, Leeds and several Somersetshire villages; in Norton St Philip near Bath James was proclaimed king. At Frome the mob was reluctantly persuaded not to destroy the local Dissenting chapel.Monod, p. 183. At Marlborough, Wiltshire the mob broke into the church and rang the bells, despite objections from the parson. In the Midlands in late June and early August, similar riots against Dissenters took place, starting in Wolverhampton during St. Peter's fair and ending at Kingswinford in Worcestershire on 1 August.Rogers, p. 77. In Wolverhampton a buckle maker was heard shouting “God damn King George, and the Duke of Marlborough” and a suspected spy was forced by the mob to get on his knees and bless King James III.Monod, p. 191. Robert Holland of Bilston urged the mob: “Now boys goe on we will have no King but James the third & he will be here in a month and wee will drive the old Rogue into his Country again to sow Turnipps”.Monod, pp. 191-192. Similar expressions of loyalty to James were heard in Walsall and Leek.Monod, p. 192. In Warrington on 10 June bells were rung and the mob shouted “Down with the Rump”. However they were prevented from attacking a Dissenting meeting house.Monod, pp. 183-185. In Leeds a bonfire was made and a man was later indicted for threatening a Dissenting meeting place.Monod, p. 185. In Manchester in early May James Stuart had been proclaimed James III. Between 28 May and 23 June there was a spate of rioting, with the Dissenting chapel in Cross Street ransacked and destroyed between 1 June and 30 July. The historian Paul Monod said \\"[t]his methodical destruction must have passed on to Dissenters the chilling message that the Manchester Jacobite crowd wanted their presence totally extinguished. ... It was a violent call for a return to the [religious] uniformity of Charles II's reign\\". Lord Cobham's dragoons eventually restored order but the rioting had by then spread to Monton and Houghton, where Dissenting chapels were attacked on 13 June. A week later the Dissenting chapels in Blackley, Greenacres, Failsworth and Standing were attacked and by 25 June the Dissenting chapels in Pilkington and Wigan had been attacked. In the West Midlands and Lancashire over thirty Dissenting chapels were attacked. In Shrewsbury during the riots a paper was posted: > We Gentlemen of the Loyal Mob of Shrewsbury, do issue out this Proclamation > to all Dissenters from the Church of England, of what Kind or Denomination > soever, whether Independent, Baptists or Quakers: If you, or any of you, do > encourage or suffer any of that damnable Faction called Presbyterians, to > assemble themselves amongst you, in any of your Conventicles, at the time of > Divine Worship, you may expect to meet with the same that they have been > treated with. Given under our Hands and Seals the 11th Day of July 1715. God > save the King. Paul Monod has said that the hostility shown towards the Dissenters, especially Presbyterians, was astonishing and that \\"[p]opular Tory rage...centred on religious rather than secular objects – in particular, on the hated meeting-houses\\".Monod, p. 191, p. 194. He argues that plebeian English people were attached to the Church of England because it embodied a myth of unity and they feared Hanoverian–Whig rule would return England to the rule of Puritans between 1649–1660, when the Church of England had been abolished.Monod, p. 194, p. 176. Aftermath Around 500 people were arrested for rioting in Shropshire, Staffordshire and Worcestershire with around 2,000 people taking part in the riots in these counties with several hundred more in Birmingham.Monod, pp. 187-88. In response to these riots, the new Whig majority passed the Riot Act to put down disturbances. This law strengthened magistrates powers and allowed Justices of the Peace to disperse demonstrations without fear of prosecution.Rogers, p. 80. In September and early October the government arrested the leading Tories in fear of a Jacobite rising. The Jacobite rising of 1715 resulted in failure.

Biography He was born in Brescia, to a family of prolific organ builders, a profession which also included his father Graziadio. His was musically educated by Giovanni Contino and Girolamo Cavazzoni. =Organ builder= At age 21, he was sent by his father, who reassured the Duke Guglielmo Gonzaga of his son's abilities, to fix the organ of the basilica of Santa Barbara in Mantua. Additionally, Costanzo worked with his father in the construction of the Antegnati organ, at one time the largest and most famous in the world, which was built in 1581 for the friars of St. Joseph's Church in Brescia. In 1595 he was commissioned by Catherine Gonzaga, daughter of the Marquis Alfonso Gonzaga, for the construction of the organ at the Church of St. Erasmus Prepositurale in Castel Goffredo.Carlo Gozzi, Raccolta di documenti per la Storia di Castelgoffredo e biografia di que' principi Gonzaga che l'hanno governato personalmente, 1840 Although few of his instruments survive, the remarkable Organ Antegnati of the church of St. Nicholas (1588) in Bergamo was restored in 1996. He is most famous for the work L'arte organica (1608) which provides technical details of 144 organs built by his family, rules about the tuning of organs and harpsichords, and advice regarding organ registration. =Organist and composer= Costanzo was an organist at the Brescia cathedral from 1584 until 1619.Pratt, Waldo Selden. The History of Music. New York: G. Schirmer, Inc., 1907. 121. Despite suffering a stroke sometime near 1600, he continued as principal organist. He was relieved of his duties as organist in 1620 because of his crippled left hand. He was not dismissed from his post and of his salary, as he was deemed \\"worthy of the city\\". He wrote several Masses and madrigals between 1571 and 1592, and published a book of organ pieces, including some of his own, in 1608. In 1571 he published, in Venice, The First Book of Madrigals for Four Voices with a Dialogue for Eight. Subsequently, he published, on an almost biennial basis, anthologies of mainly sacred compositions (Masses, psalms and motets), but also including secular works.

She was the mother of painter Theophila Gwatkin and sister of the artists Sir Joshua Reynolds and Frances Reynolds and of the pamphleteer Elizabeth Johnson. Origins Mary was the eldest daughter and third child of Samuel Reynolds, master of the Plympton Earl grammar school, Devonshire, by his wife, Theophila Potter. She was seven years older than her brother Joshua Reynolds and her fondness for drawing is said to have influenced him when a boy. In 1740 she provided £60, half of the premium paid to Thomas Hudson the portrait-painter, for Joshua's pupilage, and 9 years later advanced money for his expenses in Italy.Lee, Elizabeth. Mary Palmer. Dictionary of National Biography, 1885–1900, Vol.43. Sir Joshua Reynolds painted two portraits of his sister Mary, one made about 1747, the other when she was aged about 60 years of age. Both portraits descended to her great-grandson, George Stawell of Great Torrington. Their other siblings included the artist Frances Reynolds and Elizabeth Johnson.

She later served as an accommodation ship as the second HMS Yeoman. Construction and commissioning Worcester was ordered in April 1918 as part of the 13th Order of the 1917-1918 Naval Programme. She was laid down on 20 December 1918 by J. Samuel White at Cowes, Isle of Wight, and launched on 24 October 1919.Naval History: SHIPS OF THE ROYAL NAVY, 1914-1919 - in ALPHABETICAL ORDER (Part 2 of 2) After launching, she was transferred to the Royal Navy Dockyard at Portsmouth for fitting out, and was completed there on 20 September 1922. She was commissioned into service the same day with the pennant number D96. Service history =Before World War II= After entering service with the fleet in 1922, Worcester saw service in the Atlantic Fleet and Mediterranean Fleet before being decommissioned, transferred to the Reserve Fleet, and placed in reserve at Portsmouth in the early 1930s. In 1939, Worcester was selected for recommissioning as the fleet mobilised because of deteriorating diplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and Nazi Germany. =World War II= 1939–40 After the United Kingdom entered World War II on 3 September 1939, Worcester prepared for war service, recommissioning that month, taking aboard stores, and reporting for duty with the 16th Destroyer Flotilla - which also included the destroyer leader and the destroyers , , , , , and - at Portsmouth for convoy escort and patrol operations in the English Channel and Southwestern Approaches, which she began in October 1939. She remained on these duties until May 1940, when the German invasion of the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France began and she came under the Commander-in-Chief, Dover to support the evacuation of Allied personnel from Europe as German ground forces advanced. On 24 May, she was assigned to Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of Allied troops from Dunkirk, France, during which she made six trips to the Dunkirk beaches, transported a total of 4,350 troops to the United Kingdom, and suffered damage in a German air attack on 27 May 1940. Worcester was under repair during June 1940 - the month in which her pennant number was changed to I96 - but in July 1940 she returned to service with the 16th Destroyer Flotilla, now based at Harwich, for convoy escort and patrol operations in the North Sea. In August 1940 she was transferred to Western Approaches Command for convoy defence duty in the Western Approaches, which she continued without major incident through the end of 1940. 1941–42 In January 1941, Worcester transferred back to the 16th Destroyer Flotilla at Harwich for more North Sea convoy escort and patrol work, this time with Whitshed and the destroyer leader and destroyer . In March 1941, she and Whitshed escorted Convoy FS 29, which was steaming south along the east coast of Great Britain and came under German air attack on 6 March. On 7 March, she and Whitshed chased a German motor torpedo boat - an S-boat, known to the Allies as an \\"E-boat\\" - which had been detected near the convoy; the two destroyers were unable to make contact with it. Unfortunately for the convoy, the E-boat had been serving as a decoy for the German 1st S-Boote (E-boat) Flotilla, which attacked the convoy when Worcester and Whitshed were too far away to intervene. The Germans penetrated the remaining escort - reduced to only the escort destroyer and the patrol sloop - to sink two of FS 29s merchant ships. Worcester continued her escort and patrol duties without significant incident until February 1942, when her flotilla was put on alert for the possibility that the German battlecruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau and heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen would attempt a breakout from Brest in German-occupied France to move to a port in Germany. In preparation for opposing such a breakout, Worcester, Mackay, Walpole, and Whitshed were conducting exercises with the destroyer leader and destroyer of the 21st Destroyer Flotilla to practise torpedo attacks against enemy ships when they received word on 12 February 1942 that the German ships were indeed steaming to Germany via the English Channel, Strait of Dover, and North Sea in what was to become known as the \\"Channel Dash.\\" The British ships were ordered to attack the German naval force. During her unsuccessful torpedo attack, Worcester was hit by 11-inch (280-mm) shells from the battlecruisers and 8-inch (203-mm) shells from Prinz Eugen, suffering 26 killed or mortally wounded and 45 injured. Most of the dead are buried side by side at Shotley Naval Cemetery, opposite Worcester's Harwich moorings The German gunfire inflicted severe structural damage on Worcester, starting fires, flooding her No. 1 boiler room, and causing her to go dead in the water. Her surviving crew managed to put out her fires, get back underway, and proceed to Parkeston Quay (Harwich) for repairs without the aid of tugs. Nominated for conversion to a Short-Range Escort, Worcester was under repair and conversion until August 1942. Returning to service in September 1942, she was assigned to the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands to support Arctic convoys during their voyages between the United Kingdom and the Kola Inlet in the Soviet Union. On 16 September, she deployed with Venomous, the destroyers , , and , and the escort destroyer for Operation Gearbox, in which the ships established a refuelling base at Lowe Sound on Spitsbergen for Allied escort ships on the Arctic run. With the base established, Worcester departed Lowe Sound on 20 September with the destroyers and and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary oiler RFA Oligarch to join Convoy QP 14 during its voyage from the Kola Inlet to Loch Ewe, Scotland. She detached from QP 14 on 26 September. Worcester remained with the Home Fleet through December 1942. That month, she deployed with Montrose and the destroyers and , the Royal Australian Navy destroyer , and the Polish Navy destroyer ORP Piorun as the screen for the battleships and and the light cruiser as they provided cover for Convoy RA 51 as it steamed from the Kola Inlet to the United Kingdom in case German heavy warships attempted to interfere in its passage. 1943–45 In January 1943, Worcester was released from duty with the Home Fleet. She returned to the 16th Destroyer Flotilla at Harwich and in February 1943 resumed operations in the North Sea, escorting convoys and conducting interception patrols targeting German E-boats before they could launch attacks against Allied convoys. On 24 October 1943, she deployed off Norfolk, England, with Mackay and small craft of the Royal Navy Coastal Forces to intercept E-boats thought to be gathering for an attack on Convoys FN 1160 and FS 1164, steaming northbound and southbound, respectively, in the North Sea along the east coast of Great Britain. Worcester, Mackay, and the Coastal Forces craft engaged E-boats of the German 4th Torpedo Boat Flotilla on 25 October 1943 off Cromer, preventing them from attacking the convoys; four of the E-boats did not return to base at IJmuiden in the Netherlands. Worcester continued her escort and interception operations until 23 December 1943 when she detonated a mine in the North Sea near Smith's Knoll. The mine destroyed her stern structure, and she was towed to Great Yarmouth. She was under repair and survey until April 1944, when she was deemed beyond economical repair and was decommissioned. In May 1944, Worcester was selected for use as an accommodation ship in London upon completion of repairs and modification for her new role. In January 1945 she was towed to London, and after local preparation for use as an accommodation ship, was recommissioned with the new name HMS Yeoman, the second Royal Navy ship of the name, in June 1945. She remained in service as such after the surrender of Japan brought World War II to an end in August 1945. Decommissioning and disposal Yeoman remained in use as an accommodation ship until placed on the disposal list in 1946. She was sold for scrapping on 17 September 1946 to the British Iron & Steel Corporation (BISCO), which allocated her to Thos W Ward to be broken up. She was towed to the shipbreakers yard at Grays, Essex, England, in February 1947.

Since 1974 it is located in the City of Sunderland in the county of Tyne and Wear. The township lies on the river Wear, and on the North-eastern railway; now a cyclist route/footpath, 3 miles north-east of Chester-le-Street; includes the villages of Chaters-Hough, Fatfield, and Picktree; and forms part of the chapelry of Birtley. The soil and subsoil are clay. The chief crops are wheat, oats and turnips. A considerable portion of Lambton Park, the seat of the Earl of Durham, and the castle and gardens, being on the north side of the river Wear, are in the township of Harraton, but for particulars see Lambton Castle. History In 1870-72 described Harraton thus: the manor belongs to the Earl of Durham; and has his seat, Lambton Castle, on an eminence adjacent to the Wear. There is a chapel-school of the Established church, and chapels for Wesleyans and Primitive Methodists. The sub-district contains Washington parish, and six townships and a chapelry of Chester-le-Street parish. The parish church of Harraton is called Fatfield St George for historical reasons. The church was built in 1879 on land given by the Earl of Durham. The church was massively reordered in the 1980s and inside is warm, light and contemporary, reflecting the informal and lively style of worship that takes place.http://www.stgeorgesfatfield.co.uk/pictures_and_images_of_st_georges_church.html Harraton Colliery Chapel was built in 1873 financed by the Earl of Durham and is of brick construction seating 150, the building is still standing. It was used by the Primitive Methodists. This particular branch of Methodism had as its aim the recovery, as they saw it of the principles and practice of the early Methodists which had been lost or at least played down. The chapel was the chosen place of worship for believers of the working classes, where as the Anglican Church was seen as the domain of the “bosses”. The Chapel functioned as a place of worship until 1932 when it closed. = Mining = Coal was extensively worked; but the majority of the coal pits are exhausted. Row Pit, Harraton Colliery was the scene of a fatal explosion on Monday, 30 June 1817. Some miners were sent to work in an area of the colliery which was not free from firedamp and the men were expressly ordered to use safety lamps. One man, John Moody, ignored this instruction and was observed using a candle. The overman ordered Moody to extinguish the candle, which he did. Shortly afterwards Moody was again found using a candle and reprimanded. He extinguished the candle and lit his lamp. The overman had just left him when the explosion occurred. 38 of the 41 men underground were killed, including a grandfather, his two sons and seven grandsons. Two days later eight workmen descended Nova Scotia Pit, part of the same colliery. When they did not return another party went down but were forced back by chokedamp. Late on the following day six bodies were recovered and there was \\"little hope of recovery for the other two\\". All eight were recorded as being buried on 5 July.

Creep feed is sometimes offered to swine, and it is possible with companion grazing animals such as sheep and goats. Creep feeding is used almost exclusively in situations where animal prices are high, feed costs are low, offspring is born in the spring, and the animals are purebred. Studies show that the use of creep feed consistently causes more rapid growth and a higher weaning weight. However, data also suggests that beef calves that do not receive creep feed may catch up with creep-fed calves' weight post-weaning, so the greatest increase in profits is realized in stocker operations where animals are sold soon after weaning. The composition of creep feed can vary with the price of the various components, but it is usually has a base of cracked corn, rolled oats, alfalfa, brewer's grain or any combination of these four. Other ingredients can include rolled barley, soybean meal, soybean hulls, molasses, Dicalcium phosphate and mineral salts.  Beef calves  In beef cattle production, profits are derived almost entirely from the weaning weight of the calf. Milk from the mother supplies only half of the nutrients the calf needs to achieve its maximum growth rate and weaning weight. By offering creep feed, both the rate of weight gain and the weaning weight of the calf can be significantly improved. It is used primarily with spring-born calves, as pasture quality at this time is declining, preventing the calf from finding the other 50% of its nutritive needs by grazing. A calf requires approximately 10% of its body weight in milk daily; for a calf, this means of milk. As the calf grows, the amount of milk it requires begins to exceed the capacity of its mother to produce the milk. A calf requires of milk, but a beef cow only produces approximately of milk a day. The 500-lb calf is therefore shorted nearly of milk. This difference is made up for by offering creep feed. However, a calf's rumen is still small and poorly developed - for this reason, creep feed offered to beef calves must be very energy-dense. Creep feeding calves may not always be economically desirable; farmers must be cautious not to over-invest in creep feed for calves, as an overfed, \\"fleshy\\" calf fetches a very low price at market. Creep-feeding is also not recommended for heifers, as excessive weight gain early in life can cause fatty deposits in the calf's udder, resulting in poor milk production in the adult animal. Creep-fed calves show a very high percentage of marbling at slaughter. Creep feed in calves is usually offered in a way that allows for calves to free- feed. Pigs Creep feeding piglets rarely actually increases their weaning weight, but it does produce pigs who eat more later in life. The younger the age at which creep feed is offered, the stronger the effect is. Other animals Creep feeding is commonly used in foals to supplement the mare's milk and reduce stress on both the mare and the foal.

In 2012, the members released a new single called \\"Astronaut\\" in February. Months later, the members decided to focus on solo projects and would disband sometime during the spring or summer of 2012. It was later announced by the members that Jamatami would perform a \\"farewell concert\\" in Germany on August 24, 2012 for a reunion and to perform a final concert for the fans. Formation and Success During the spring of 2011, RTL did a casting call for a new pop group. The members chosen were Jazz, Miriam, Matt and Tamer. During this time, the band members became good friends and decided to name their band Jamatami after each of the members, Ja(zz) Ma(tt) Ta(mer) Mi(riam) (with their name sometimes being stylized as JAMATAMI or JaMaTaMi). The group had their first appearance in the Toggo Tour during 2011. Around the same time, they began starring in the reality series Jamatami: Das Star- Tagebuch, which follows the group during their formation and rise to success. On May 13, 2011, Jamatami released their first single \\"Perfect Day (Tic Tac Toe)\\", which included the b-side track \\"Rollercoaster\\". The song, in promotion with Super RTL, would become the group's biggest and most notable hit single. On June 17, 2011, their debut album \\"Tic Tac Toe\\" was released in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. It debuted in the German charts on July 4, 2011, peaking at #38 for 4 weeks. They later released the follow-up single \\"Dance Under The Moonlight\\" on July 15, 2011, which was also successful in Germany. On September 23, 2011, their third single \\"Ma-Ya-Hi\\", a cover of the hit single \\"Dragostea Din Tei\\" by O-Zone, debuted in the German charts at #84, staying there for 1 week.

Sudden Split and Farewell Concert On January 27, 2012, Jamatami returned with their fourth single, a new song called \\"Astronaut\\", which included a b-side track, a cover of Kylie Minogue's hit single \\"I Should Be So Lucky\\". The group also performed some concerts during February, with Matt uploading a video of him and Miriam performing a cover of Adele's \\"Someone Like You\\" before heading out for a concert. However, sometime during spring or summer 2012, the members of Jamatami decided to split up and focus on solo projects, this decision having been reach either in March or April 2012. The first announcement of a \\"farewell concert\\" was made by Miriam and Jazz on their official Facebook fanpages on May 2, 2012, with the concert already having been scheduled previously. During the summer, the members spent time preparing their solo material, which they planned to present at the Jamatami farewell concert, scheduled for August 24, 2012. However, due to the announcement having not been made on the official Jamatami website or fanpage, many fans missed the announcement until it was announced on Jamatami's official Facebook page in August 2012. On August 24, 2012, the members reunited in Germany for a final concert before officially disbanding, performing many of their past hits and popular songs. Also, during this concert, Tamer performed for the first time his new single, titled \\"Dance All Night\\" and a cover of Cher's hit single \\"Believe\\". Jazz also performed her new solo single as Jazz Mine, titled \\"Something Special\\". Matt also performed new material at the concert. After the concert, the group took photos and did autographs, giving their fans the chance to meet them as Jamatami. Solo Careers Since the disbandment, Tamer and Jazz Mine have been working on new solo material. Matt is also involved in new projects as well. As for Miriam, it is believed that she is taking a break from the music world to focus on her studies, as her latest status on her official fanpage mentions that she is busy studying for exams. During 2013, Matt created and launched his new official website. On the site, he created a page to play all of the Jamatami songs from their albums and singles, including the previously unreleased song \\"A Little Bit\\", a cover of the song by Ch!pz which was originally recorded for their \\"Tic Tac Toe\\" album but cut from the album for reasons unknown.

The country is home to many archaeological sites dating from Lower Paleolithic period to Mughal empire. The earliest known archaeological findings belong to the Soanian culture from the Soan Valley, near modern-day Islamabad. Soan Valley culture is considered as the best known Palaeolithic culture of Central Asia. The Mehrgarh culture was amongst the first cultures in the world to establish agriculture and livestock and live in villages. Mehrgarh civilization lasted for 5000 years till 2000 BCE after which people migrated to other areas, possibly Harappa and Mohenjo-daro. Harappa and Mohenjo-daro are the best known sites from the Indus Valley civilization (c 2500 - 1900 BCE). The earliest evidence of civilization in Pakistan can be found on the west banks of the Bolan River and the plains of Kachhi at Mehrgarh. Artifacts found in a 1979 excavation by the Pakistan Archaeology department and a team of French archaeologists can be dated back to 7000 BC. They were able to divide the Mehrgarh culture into three categories: Mehrgarh Period I- 7000 to 5500 BC, was an aceramic settlement with primitive means of agriculture and livestock. They lived in simple mud buildings and buried their dead with many elaborate goods. Mehrharn Period II- 5500 to 4800 BC, was a ceramic settlement that showed strong evidence of having manufacturing activity such as copper and stone drills and more technological kilns. The amount of riches buried with the dead decreased over time. Mehrgarn Period III- 4800 to 3500 BC, many similarities to Period II. Mehrharn Period IV- 2600 to 2000 BC, much of the city was abandoned as the Indus Valley Civilization was being born and its inhabitants migrated there. Twenty miles north of Islamabad the ancient city of Taxila can be found. Taxila, also known as the city of stones, thrived between the years of 518 BC and 600 AD, and in its prime was one of the most flourishing civilizations between the Indus and Jhelum rivers. Alexander the Great led troops through Taxila in 326 BC and he claimed it as part of his vast kingdom until it was conquered by the Mauryan Empire in 300 BC. After the fall of the Mauryan Empire, Taxila was taken back by followers of Alexander in 190 BC. Taxila owed much of it success to the fact that it was located at the intersection of the three major trade routes of India and Central and Western Asia.

For almost a decade, she was a professor and researcher in international relations at the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education (Tec de Monterrey), principally working as the director of the Instituto Global para la Sostenibilidad (IGS), formerly the Centro de Diálogo y Análysis sobre América del Norte (CEDAN). She began her academic career working in international relations and has held positions in both Mexico and the United States teaching, researching, advising and writing on topics related to international relations, especially in North America, business and environmental issues. Her publications include books, scholarly articles as well as articles and columns for various media. Education Studer received her bachelors in international relations from the Colegio de México in 1986. She received her masters (1990) and doctorate (1997) in international relations from the School of Advanced International Studies of Johns Hopkins University. Her dissertation was “MNE’s Global Strategies and Government Policies in the Automobile Industry: Ford Motor Company in North America.” In 1993 she did her field research at the Canadian Embassy in Washington. During her studies, Studer received several scholarships including a Fulbright Scholarship in 1988, Galo Plaza Fellowship of the Inter-American Dialogue in 1990, the SAIS scholarship and a scholarship from CONACYT. She is fluent in Spanish, English and French. Career =Academic career prior to Tec de Monterrey= She has been a tenured professor and researcher at a number of prestigious Mexican universities and institutions. From 1993 to 1997, she was a professor and researcher at the international studies division of the Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económicas (CIDE), which was followed by a year as a visiting professor at the department of business and economics at Colorado College in Colorado Springs.

Since then, she has held a number of public policy positions in Mexico and the United States. In 2001, she was the deputy director general for North America at the Secretaría del Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales, as well as an alternate representative to the Commission for Environmental Cooperation of North America (CEC). From 2005 to 2006 she was the research director for the Commission for Labor Cooperation in Washington, DC. In 2010, she joined the research program on climate change at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM).

She states that one frustration of academia is that much of the knowledge that is generated is not immediately useful for making political decisions. Her goal with CEDAN was to create a kind of think tank focusing on generating practical information on things that concern Mexico and its policies. About eighty percent of CEDAN’s activities were related to sustainability, environment and climate change, so Studer reorganized the institute and gave it the new name of the Instituto Global para la Sostenibilidad (Global Institute of Sustainability) or IGS, a partnership between the Tec de Monterrey and Arizona State University.

These three words (which can be translated as God, King and Fatherland), have been the motto and cornerstone of Carlism throughout its existence. What Carlism understood by these was: * Dios (God): Carlism believes in the Catholic Faith as a cornerstone of Spain, and must be politically active in its defense. * Patria (Fatherland): Carlism is heavily patriotic, Traditionalism sees the Fatherland as the nesting of communities (municipal, regional, Spain) united under one. * Rey (King): The concept of national sovereignty is rejected. Sovereignty is vested on the king, both legitimate in blood and in deeds. But this power is limited by the doctrine of the Church and the Laws and Usages of the Kingdom, and through a series of Councils, traditional Cortes and state-independent intermediate bodies. The King must also be the Defender of the Poor and Keeper of Justice. Sometimes added to this at the time of the First Carlist War was a fourth tenet Fueros. Stipulating the desires of the regions of Navarra and the Basque provinces for regional autonomy and a preservation of the Fueros, which were rights granted to these provinces by the Spanish Crown in the Middle Ages.

She is the author of two books of photographs, Using History (Steidl, 2005) and In Search of the Corn Queen (Smithsonian American Art Museum, 1994). Pratt's work is represented in major public and private collections, including the Smithsonian American Art Museum: Smithsonian Institution, The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Museum of Contemporary Photography, Portland (Oregon) Art Museum, and Minneapolis Institute of Art. Pratt served as photography bureau chief of Reuters International in New York City. Her photographs have been featured in Art in America, The New York Times Magazine and The New Yorker. Career Pratt has made a practice of documenting staged American history. Her series Nineteen Lincolns celebrates one of the most iconic elements of the bedrock of American history and puts a quirky modern twist on it. Nineteen Lincolns has been on view in solo and group shows across the country since 2007. Her book Using History is an accurate depiction of her photographic universe, which is the intersection where American past meets American present. Pratt often uses clever juxtapositions of photos to tell her tale of how Americans incorporate their country's past to explain their attitudes to the present. Author Howard Zinn (People's History of the United States) says of Pratt's Using History, \\"Greta Pratt's extraordinary photographs give us glimpses of people and places that stimulate us to think about our history, not only of the great American West, but of the nation itself. Her point of view is delightfully antic and provocative. We want not only to enjoy the moment of our viewing, but also to study and ponder each photograph, challenged to find its larger meaning.\\" Pratt's work has a clear connection with that of Martin Parr, both using hyper-saturated color to slyly capture the peculiarities of how everyday people represent themselves and their roots.http://2point8.whileseated.org/2007/01/03/greta-pratt-at-massmoca-and- atlanta-contemporary/ Education Pratt received her BFA in photography from the University of Minnesota and her MFA in from the State University of New York at New Paltz. Books *In Search of the Corn Queen (Smithsonian National Museum of American Art, 1994) *Using History (Göttingen, Germany: Steidl, 2005.) Quotes about Pratt's work “…Everyone is trying to connect to the past but the past is always fiction. How history is told reveals much more about the people and time period that are telling it than about history itself.” “This book is a collection of photographs about history perceived, about how we look at ourselves and others, about how we recreate and reaffirm the American experience, about how we continue to live with, to rationalize, and to atone for the lingering spirit of place….Pratt's photographs help create an understanding of a special form of vernacular storytelling, of acting out and dressing up the past. History as we remember it emerges from her photographs. Perhaps it could more correctly be labeled history as we want it to be remembered or, even better, as we re-create and relive it. As the American novelist Willa Cather reminds us, \\"Memory is better than reality.\\"Strickland, Rennard (2005). Using History, Public History, Vernacular Storytelling, and the Search for Self (Gottingen, Germany: Steidl.) . “What Pratt catches here is not merely anachronism or irony…What you see here is the attempt by ordinary people – nonhistorians, that is – to capture history in a form that makes it locally communally tangible – history as shared terrain…There is an idea in most of these faces, though. The idea is continuity with forebears, with first principles, with a larger conception of the time horizon than everyday life usually affords.\\"Klinkenborg, Verlyn, History Matters, Mother Jones, Sept. 1999 References External links *Official website *Fnewsmagazine.com *En.wikibooks.org Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:American contemporary artists Category:American women photographers Category:American women artists Category:Artists from Minneapolis Category:State University of New York at New Paltz alumni Category:University of Minnesota alumni ","title":"Greta Pratt"},{"id":"39743886","text":"The Djebel Onk mine is a large mine located in the Tébessa Province.

Early life Bartram was born in Trimingham, Norfolk, in 1749 the only son of Captain Richard Bartram of Great Yarmouth Norfolk. His tombstone records: Bartram however did have a sister and later his niece and nephew tried to challenge his will which left everything to his relative Cubbitt Engall Bartram. Bartram refers to Cubbitt Engall Bartram as his nephew but is actually more distantly related. Bartram is a first cousin of Cubbitt's grandfather William Bartram (born 1744). There is interesting correspondence between the Reverend William Gunn of Smallburgh Norfolk and the Bartrams in Civita Vecchia. Cubitt first arrived in Civita Vecchia in 1820 to join his relative Richard Bartram and became his heir. The Norfolk Record Office archive on William Gunn states: Cubbitt Bartram was also joined by his brother John Bartram in Civita Vecchia in the business. Jacobite connections Bartram was visited by his Jacobite relative Sir Robert Bartram (1761–1844) of Norfolk (a grandson of Sir James Alexander Wright Bt the Last Royal Governor of Georgia) in 1795. Robert Bartram was an uncle of Cubbitt Engall Bartram.

She played a political role in the struggle between Albert, King of Sweden and Queen Margaret I of Denmark over the Swedish throne in the late 14th century. Margareta Dume belonged to an originally German noble family who lived in Swedish Finland since 1362. In 1373, she married the powerful Bo Jonsson (Grip), and he gave important posts to her brothers. In 1386, she became a widow. In the will of her late spouse, she had been denied the larger part of his vast fortune and any influence upon his affairs. She contested this, left for the Swedish royal court and made the King the protector of her and her children's rights in the civil war-like conflict which erupted over the inheritance of her spouse in 1387. She also declared her support of King Albert as his ally and loyalist in his struggle against Queen Margaret. This made it possible for her to use the King's supporters in the great inheritance feud. It is noted that she had an important political position, as she exerted influence upon certain affairs of state due to her important support to the King: in 1388, for example, the King granted a member of the nobility the return of his confiscated property upon her request. She was present at the Swedish court in 1389, the same year Albert was deposed, but left for Germany after this. In 1394, she married the Swedish noble Bengt Niklisson, returned to Sweden with him and made her peace with Queen Margaret.

Vouillamoz Wine Grapes – A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pg 640 Allen Lane 2012 History and name Ampelographers believe that Minella bianca originated in the foothills around Mount Etna in the eastern part of Sicily. The grape was first described in 1760 by the Italian writer and traveler Domenico Sestini as growing in the foothills of Mount Etna where ampelographers believe that the grape originated from. The grape's name, Minella, is derived from the Sicilian minna which means breast and refers to the berries' shape. Viticulture In Sicily, Minella bianca is often inter-planted with other Sicilian wine grapes of both red and white wine varieties. Minella bianca is an early ripening grape variety that is often one of the first wine grapes to be harvested in a vintage, usually around mid-September, followed by Carricante. In some vineyards Minella bianca is part of a field blend and is inter-planted with other Sicilian wine grapes such as Carricante and Catarratto or even the red wine grape Nerello Mascalese. Wine regions Minella bianca is almost exclusively found on the island of Sicily with ampelographers believing that the grape is indigenous to the island. In 2000, there were of the grape planted, the vast majority of which were found in the province of Catania around the foothills of Mount Etna. Here the grape is a permitted grape variety in the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) white wines of Etna. Further west, the province of Enna is home to a few scattered plantings of Minella bianca. Styles Aniseed is a characteristic aroma note of wines made from Minella bianca. According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, Minella bianca tends to produce dry, aromatic wines that are characterized by aroma notes of aniseed. The grape is rarely made as a single varietal and is most often included in a blend with Catarrato and Carricante such as in the DOC wines of Etna Bianco.

How RFID skimming is performed  Modern payment cards have a built in chip that transmits the cards' information wirelessly. This is because it is necessary in order to enable contactless payments, which has become increasingly popular during recent years. Criminals can take advantage of this new technology by using a scanner that wirelessly scans the victim's payment card in the same way that a cash register scans it, when making a contactless payment. These scanners are legal and can be bought in regular electronics stores. Most modern mobile phones running Android OS have a built in NFC reader that can be used to unlawfully scan contactless payment cards. A criminal can hide the scanner e.g. inside a glove or a bag, and then place himself close to the victim and wirelessly steal the victim's payment card information. With the wirelessly obtained payment card information, the criminal can use it to make fraudulent purchases online. This is called Card Not Present fraud.  Incidence  Card not present fraud has increased rapidly between 2012–2016. In the United Kingdom an increase could be seen in card not present fraud – from 750,200 reported cases in 2012, to 1,437,832 reported cases in 2016. Since it is not possible to know which method the criminal used to obtain the victim's payment card information there are no statistics on the distribution between different types of skimming.  RFID skimming compared to other types of skimming  In contrast to other types of skimming such as ATM skimming or hacking an online merchant's web page, RFID skimming requires little or no technical expertise. In order to execute ATM skimming, the criminal needs to custom build a device, then place that device inside an ATM and later pick up the device after the victims have used it. Hacking online merchants web pages requires substantial computer knowledge.  Myths  A common myth that is often mentioned by card issuers is that a criminal can only steal the maximum amount that is allowed for contactless purchases. This sum is usually between US$30–50 and is different for each country. This has been proven wrong in a test by British consumer magazine Which?. In the test they successfully used wirelessly obtained payment card information to make an online purchase of over . A common myth is that you need RFID shield. This not true as RFID crime does not exists. RFID blocking wallets benefit only their manufactures.  Methods for preventing RFID skimming  = Metal foil = Shielding is possible by wrapping the payment card in aluminum foil. However aluminium foil tends to wear out quickly. Informal tests found that the shielding effect was not 100% effective, though it did very much reduce the maximum range for reading, from about to . = Permanent disabling of RFID functionality = RFID functionality can be disabled permanently by cutting internal wires; use of a microwave oven has also been reported successful, according to informal reports. Cutting requires location of the internal wires, followed by cutting, drilling, or heating. Methods that visibly damage the card may lead to it being rejected as a payment method when presented to a retailer in the normal way. = RFID Blocking materials = There are several products you can buy which help stop your cards being skimmed. There are RFID blocking wallets, purses, sleeves, and cards. Wallets, purses and sleeves work by acting as a Faraday cage which creates a screen around your cards which stops electromagnetic fields interacting with the cards. The RFID blocking cards are the same shape and size as a regular credit card and is placed together with the cards it should protect. It contains a jamming device that is activated automatically when someone tries to scan the payment cards in its proximity.

In addition to providing retail space for 100 specialty outlet stores, the Homewares/Furniture section of the centre is designed for 24 bulky goods retailers, such as furniture and electrical chains. Unlike many outlet centres, the Canberra site is not adjacent to the city's airport. History Austexx acquired land at Fyshwick in 2005 at a reported cost of $39 million following a bidding war with the owners of Canberra Airport. In a move reminiscent of the 2004 Orange Grove affair, an unsuccessful legal challenge under the Trade Practices Act over the zoning of the site was brought against DFO by the Canberra Airport's rival venture, Brand Depot. Construction of the shopping centre involved the clearing of the greenfield site located adjacent to the junction of two major arterial roads, Canberra Avenue and Hindmarsh Drive. The centre, car parks and loading dock areas occupy 120,000m2 over two levels, with the car park below the retail floor. The building was completed on behalf of DFO's parent company Austexx by construction firm Contexx Pty Ltd in September 2008 at an approximate cost of $100 million. In March 2012, it was announced the Canberra DFO was being placed in receivership by its struggling parent company and offered for sale, however no announcement has been made to date about a buyer for the complex which continues to trade.

Pino is director of policy and support and co-founder of End Rape on Campus, an advocacy group for survivors of campus sexual assault. As a student, Pino was one of the primary writers and one of five complainants in the 2013 Title IX and Clery Act complaints against the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Along with Annie E. Clark, she became a national leader in filing this sort of complaint, advising sexual assault victims at universities across the United States. Pino is a primary subject in the 2015 documentary film The Hunting Ground, directed by Kirby Dick and produced by Amy Ziering. Pino has since been dogged by claims from fellow activists in the field and journalists that there is little truth behind the stories she told to gain her national reputation, some going as far as to call it an elaborate “web of lies.”  Early life  Pino was raised in Miami, Florida, United States, in a family of Cuban descent. She attended International Studies Charter High School. University of North Carolina Pino attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; she was the first in her family to go to college. She has stated that she was raped twice while in college. The first incident occurred several weeks into her freshman year, when she was in a fraternity member's room and he gave her a drugged drink. According to her, she fell unconscious, and only woke up the next morning, in her own dorm room, with scratches and bruises, with a note attached to her that said \\"We found you by the road\\". She did not report the incident. Her second rape occurred, she says, in March 2012, during her sophomore year, when an unknown male student whom she had just met brought her into a bathroom and forcibly raped her; she emerged, bloodied, and ran back to her room, dripping blood the whole way; she went to sleep, and woke up in a pool of her own blood. After telling administrators that she was raped, Pino claimed that she had been unsupported by the university administration and policies that purported to protect her and other students reporting sexual violence. She alleged that an administrator told her that her problem was that she was \\"just lazy.\\" The veracity of Pino's accounts of her rapes has been questioned by journalist Cathy Young, as well as by KC Johnson and Stuart Taylor in their 2017 book The Campus Rape Frenzy. Young also wrote that, after the first time she questioned Pino's story in print, she was contacted by another female anti-rape activist, who did not want to be named, who told Young that she and some other activists were \\"frustrated\\" by what she called Pino's \\"web of lies\\".  Activism  According to Pino, her activism was driven by her experiences with sexual assault and harassment at the University of North Carolina. According to Pino, when she began to communicate to the UNC administration her desire to receive support for her assault and for the assaults of students who approached her for help, UNC administration denied that their policies were in non- compliance. In response, Pino approached UNC alumna Annie E. Clark, who also had reported being mistreated. The two began to research Title IX, a federal legislation which grants students the right to an education without sex discrimination, as well as the Clery Act, which grants protections for sexual assault victims on college campuses. Their research yielded a strategy originally proposed by feminist scholar Catharine MacKinnon in the 1970s. She argued for using the threat of withdrawing federal funding as a means to force universities to effect changes in sexual assault policies. In January 2013, Pino and Clark, together with several other UNC students and one former administrator, filed a 34-page complaint against the university with the United States Department of Education's OCR. After the women filed the complaint, the OCR and the Clery Compliance Division both launched investigations into how the university was handling sexual assault and crime on campus. Following the media coverage of the UNC complaint, Pino and Clark connected with sexual assault survivors from institutions across the country and began assisting them in filing Title IX and Clery Act complaints against their institutions. As a result, students have successfully filed complaints against Swarthmore College, Occidental College, the University of California, Berkeley, Dartmouth College, The University of Southern California, and Columbia University, among others. Clark and Pino's activism are the subject of a controversial 2015 documentary film, The Hunting Ground. End Rape on Campus In 2013, Pino and Clark co-founded End Rape on Campus (EROC), a group working to end sexual violence on campuses around the country. EROC helps people who have been sexually assaulted with direct resources, with pro bono therapists and attorneys, and it provides assistance with filing complaints.

At 19 he received a full scholarship to study business in France where he learnt to speak French fluently. This developed into a career in tourism and politics sending him to the United States where he met his wife, Linda Lewis. He had a thriving political career acquiring the position of President of Alliance Francaise, Harare, Zimbabwe and the Deputy Minister of Tourism during his late 30s and early 40s.

She was the wife of Charles S. Deneen. Known at the time as \\"the ideal wife for a governor\\" for her calm and unassuming style, she was also an active participant in her husband's campaigns, and in the woman's club movement. __TOC__ Early life and education Bina Day Maloney was born on February 14, 1868, to a prosperous Carroll County, Illinois farm family. She was born and raised in rural Mount Carroll Township, where she attended the Big Cut district school. Her father was the township's commissioner of roads. Because her parents moved into the town of Mount Carroll several decades later, she was sometimes inaccurately reported as having been born and raised in Mount Carroll itself. In her teens in the 1880s, she taught school for a time in Sac County, Iowa. She studied at the Mount Carroll Seminary (later known as Shimer College), exiting in 1890. Although then as now primarily a liberal arts institution, the school also offered courses in stenography and typewriting. Deneen performed well enough in her studies to be hired as an instructor of these subjects in 1889 and 1890. Subsequently, she moved to Chicago and worked briefly as a stenographer or typist, living in a boardinghouse. She married Chicago law student Charles S. Deneen, the brother of a fellow boardinghouse resident, in Princeton, Illinois in 1891. Both hailed from strongly Methodist families; the marriage rites were performed by Mrs. Deneen's sister's husband, a Methodist minister. Political career Deneen played ae part in each of her husband's campaigns, although chiefly behind the scenes. These campaigns began at the ward committeeman level in Chicago, quickly rising to Cook County state's attorney and the state legislature. Charles became the first two-term governor of Illinois, serving from 1904 to 1912. As the First Lady of Illinois, Deneen cut a demure figure, describing herself as a \\"home woman\\". She was the first First Lady of Illinois to have a child while living in the governor's mansion—her fourth child, Bina, born in 1906—a feat that would not be repeated until the birth of Samantha Thompson in 1978. She remains the only First Lady of Illinois to give birth in the executive mansion. As First Lady of Illinois, Deneen was in charge of entertaining the various visitors to the executive mansion. Notable among these were president William Howard Taft, for whom a special ramp had to be installed, as well as former president Theodore Roosevelt, and the French and British ambassadors. Like many other early Shimer College alumnae, Bina was active in the woman's club movement. She served as president of the Englewood Woman's Club, dedicated to the \\"promotion of the highest interest of humanity through Sociological, Literary, Educational, Art, and Music work,\\" and was also active in the Chicago Woman's Club, which she joined in 1915. She was also active in the First Methodist Episcopal Church of Englewood. The Deneens returned to electoral politics in 1924, when Charles ran successfully for US Senate. Deneen described herself as a \\"passive politician\\", but stumped actively for her husband during his final, failed Senate campaign in 1930. Feeling uncomfortable with traditional political speeches, however, she confined herself to expressing her gratitude and recognition of the campaign workers' efforts. In the violent \\"Pineapple Primary\\" of 1928, in which the organizations of Deneen and \\"Big Bill\\" Thompson squared off against one another, the Deneens' home in Englewood was bombed, destroying the front porch. The 61st political bombing in Chicago that year, it marked a significant turning point in the campaign, which ended in a decisive victory for the Deneenites. Mrs. Deneen's calm response was considered noteworthy; she recalled later that \\"as we were in Washington and no one was hurt, and none of my paintings and books in the front of the house were damaged to any extent, I felt it hardly called for hysterics.\\" Death and legacy After her husband's death, Deneen had moved from Englewood to nearby Hyde Park. She died on October 30, 1950, and was laid to rest in the Oak Woods Cemetery. She survived her husband by ten years. The home where the Deneens lived in Englewood still stands at 457 W. 61st Place in Chicago.

Helga Davida Fägerskiöld (30 September 1871 – 25 September 1958) was a Swedish baroness, and an accused in a famous Swedish murder trial and cause célèbre: the so called Broxvik Drama, in 1896–1898. She was born in Härna. Her parents were Baron Knut Henrik Fägerskiöld and Georgina Sofia Gunilla Adelsköld. She was present at the death bed of her intended father-in- law, the noble and courtier Evert Taube von Block, at Broxik Manor in 1895. She later convinced her fiancé, the noble Evert Taube, that his mother Betzy von Röök had murdered his father by poison. In the body of Evert Taube von Block, traces of poison were found. The case was brought to trial in 1896, upon which Betzy von Röök sued her for slander. The trial was a sensation, and the lawyers of the parties made appeals to the public's sentiments by populism, after which followers took sides based upon political sympathies. Fägerskiöld was represented by Karl Staaf. In 1897, she confessed that she herself had poisoned Evert Taube von Block for her fiancé to inherit Broxvik Manor: she had accused Betzy von Röök to prevent her from inheriting the property and will it to her younger son. As her statement was supported by circumstances, she was accused of murder and Betzy von Röök was acquitted. She subsequently retracted her confession, stating that she had only made it to create a sensation to avoid any attention from her recent illegitimate child birth. The court found itself unable to sentence her guilty upon her earlier confession as it did not regard the evidence sufficient to convict her guilty against her denial. On 1 April 1898, the case was closed and Helga Fägerskiöld was freed for lack of proof. She left Sweden after the trial and spent the rest of her life in the United States. In 1908, she married the American lawyer William W. White. She died in New York City on 25 September 1958. Yngve Lyttkens wrote Dramat på Broxvik (The Broxvik Drama) in 1948 based on the case.

She previously served as Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, the first woman to hold this position. Prior to her appointment to the CIA, she served as Deputy Counsel to the President for National Security Affairs in the Office of White House Counsel. Her term as CIA Deputy Director coincided with the global surveillance disclosures, the CIA hacking into the computers of U.S. Senate employees, and the release of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture. She replaced Tony Blinken as White House Deputy National Security Advisor, a position she held until the end of the Obama administration.  Early life and education  Haines was born in the New York City borough of Manhattan on August 29, 1969, to parents Adrian (née Rappin) and Thomas Haines. Her mother was a painter. Adrian developed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and contracted avian tuberculosis, leading to her death when Haines was fifteen years old. Her father is a biochemist and professor emeritus at City College, who helped found the City University of New York medical school, where he served as the chair of the biochemistry department. After graduating from Hunter College High School, Haines traveled to Japan for a year and enrolled in Kodokan, an elite judo institute in Tokyo. In 1988, Haines enrolled in the University of Chicago where she studied theoretical physics. While attending the University of Chicago, Haines worked repairing car engines at a mechanic shop in Hyde Park. In 1991 Haines had taken up flying lessons in New Jersey, where she met her future husband, David Davighi. She later graduated with her Bachelor of Arts in physics in 1992. Haines in 2013 In 1992, Haines moved to Baltimore, Maryland where she enrolled as a doctorate student at Johns Hopkins University. However, later that year, Haines dropped out and alongside her future husband, purchased an auctioned bar in Fell's Point, Baltimore which had been seized in a drug raid; turning the former bar into an independent bookstore and café. She named the store Adrian's Book Cafe, after her late mother; Adrian's realistic oil paintings filled the store. The bookstore won City Paper's \\"Best Independent Bookstore\\" in 1997 and was known for having an unusual collection of literary offerings, local writers, erotica reading nights, and small press publications. Adrian's hosted a number of literary readings, including erotica readings, which became a media focus when she was appointed by the President to be the Deputy Director of the CIA. She served as the president of the Fell's Point Business Association until 1998, when she enrolled at the Georgetown University Law Center. Haines later received her Juris Doctor from Georgetown in 2001.  Career  L to R: Susan E. Rice, Avril Haines and Lisa Monaco, (2015) From 2001 until 2002, Haines was a legal officer at the Hague Conference on Private International Law. From 2002 until 2003, she served as a law clerk for United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit Judge Danny Julian Boggs. From 2003 until 2006, Haines worked in the Office of the Legal Adviser of the Department of State, first in the Office of Treaty Affairs and then in the Office of Political Military Affairs. From 2007 until 2008, Haines worked for the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations as Deputy Chief Counsel for the Majority Senate Democrats (under then-chairman Joe Biden). She then worked for the State Department as the assistant legal adviser for treaty affairs from 2008 to 2010. In 2010, Haines was appointed to serve in the office of the White House Counsel as Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy Counsel to the President for National Security Affairs at the White House. On April 18, 2013, Obama nominated Haines to serve as Legal Adviser of the Department of State, to fill the position vacated after Harold Hongju Koh resigned to return to teaching at Yale Law School. However, on June 13, 2013, Obama withdrew Haines' nomination to be Legal Adviser of the Department of State, choosing instead to select her as Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Haines was nominated to replace Michael Morell, the CIA's deputy and former acting director. The office of the deputy director is not subject to Senate confirmation, with Haines subsequently taking office on August 9, 2013, the final day of Morrell's tenure. Haines was the first woman to ever hold the office of the deputy director, while Gina Haspel was the first female career intelligence officer to be named Deputy Director. In 2015 Haines was tasked with determining whether CIA personnel involved in the hacking of the computers of Senate staffers who were authoring the Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture would be disciplined. Haines chose not to discipline them, overruling the CIA Inspector General. Subsequently, she was involved in the CIA project of redacting the Senate report for release. She was also the first female Deputy National Security Advisor (DNSA). During her years in Obama White House, Haines played a significant role working closely with John Brennan in determining administration policy on \\"targeted killings\\" by drones. The ACLU strongly criticized the Obama policy on drone killings as failing to meet international human rights norms. During the Democratic National Committee email leak during the 2016 presidential campaign, Haines as DNSA convened a series of meetings to discuss ways to respond to the hacking and leaks. =After government service= In 2018, Haines was an outspoken supporter of President Trump's controversial nomination of Gina Haspel to serve as CIA director. While not commenting on Haspel's record, she praised her knowledge of the agency and intelligence, a position hailed by the White House as it promoted Haspel's confirmation. Haspel was reportedly involved in the operations of CIA secret black site torture sites in 2002 and 2003. She also has admitted her role in helping destroy videotapes of torture by CIA interrogators. At least one progressive nonprofit leader has said he or she feared \\"professional reprisal\\" for speaking out publicly in criticism of Haines' support of Haspel as CIA director. After leaving the White House, Haines was appointed to multiple posts at the Columbia University. She is a senior research scholar working on the Columbia World Projects, a program designed to bring to bear academic scholarship on some of the most basic and fundamental challenges the world is facing. Haines is also a fellow at the Human Rights Institute and National Security Law Program at Columbia Law School. Haines also serves on the bipartisan National Commission on Military, National, and Public Service. The commission was created by Congress both to develop recommendations to inspire more Americans, in particular young people, to participate in public service and to review the military selective service process. Haines has consulted for a variety of for-profit entities with business interests related to American national security policy, including Palantir Technologies and WestExec Advisors. In late June 2020, shortly after taking on the role of overseeing foreign policy and national security considerations for the Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign transition team, references to Palantir and other corporations for which she had worked were abruptly removed from her resume as posted on the website of the Brookings Institution, in relation to a fellowship she held there.

It is the successor to the Camden Police Department.Mast, George (April 28, 2013). \\"Holdouts lament police transition\\" part 1. Courier-Post. Then-chief Scott Thomson used the disbanding and replacement to transform the department's policies. Camden's new department has been called \\"a model\\" of how to reform police departments. It is sometimes referred to as the Metro Division even though, unlike many other metropolitan police forces in the United States, it presently does not patrol outside of the city. As a \\"county police\\" force, the department is available to all municipalities in Camden County on a voluntary basis; however, no other municipalities within Camden County have announced plans to join the county police district.Laday, Jason (July 23, 2013). \\"Camden County towns to study possible merger of police departments\\". South Jersey Times.Camden County Police Department (official website). Retrieved July 22, 2013.  Background  In January of 2011, the city department laid off 168 of the department's 370 officers when contract negotiations stalled and the city was facing a budget shortfall. Camden experienced a spike in homicides, and the city police department wanted to hire more patrol officers but couldn't afford to \\"partly because of generous union contracts.\\" According to CNN the corruption had also \\"rendered the existing agency unfixable.\\" On August 2, 2011, the City of Camden and Camden County announced that the city police department would be disbanded in favor of a new county police force.Baxter, Christopher; Megerian, Chris (August 2, 2011). \\"Camden County to form regional police department\\". The Star-Ledger. Well-known law enforcement executive John Timoney was retained to develop an organizational and functional plan for the department. The creation of the county police force in place of the city force was expected to save between $14 and $16 million annually out of the $60 million budget of the city police department. Unlike the city police department it replaced, the new \\"county\\" department was not initially unionized. Savings were expected to come from reducing the fringe benefits that had been required under the city's union contract. The move was endorsed by the Mayor of Camden, Dana Redd, who indicated that the new police department would be more cost- effective, and that the high absentee rate of city officers had affected the former department's ability to keep the city safe. An official of the Camden Fraternal Order of Police, which represented city police officers, described the plan as \\"union busting\\" and called it \\"a recipe for disaster\\" that would replace experienced city officers with new personnel unfamiliar with the city.Bernstein, Jenn; Madden, David (August 8, 2012). \\"Camden Mayor's Decision To Dismantle City's Police Force Stirs Up Controversy\\". KYW-TV. A community group known as the Citizens' Community Committee for Public Safety, along with the Camden Fraternal Order of Police, criticized the plan as being political, not practical.\\"Groups against Camden County Police Department to hold community meetings\\". Philly.com. March 7, 2012. The mayor's political opponents also criticized the disbandment of the city's department.Vargas, Claudia (April 30, 2013). \\"In Camden, challengers slam police and school takeovers\\". The Philadelphia Inquirer. Establishment of county department In 2012, the entire city police department was laid off and required to apply for a position with the new county police department. The application process included a 50-page form, psychological testing, and an interview process. Many employees were angry. Then-chief Scott Thomson saw it as a way to \\"hit the reset button\\" and completely change how policing worked in Camden; he characterized the city force at the time as \\"apathetic, lethargic and corrupt\\". He envisioned transforming how Camden officers saw themselves from \\"Warrior\\" to \\"Guardian.\\" The new department took over primary responsibility for policing the City of Camden on May 1, 2013. 155 officers reapplied and were hired for the new department, while 65 officers refused to reapply. The new department reached its full complement of 401 sworn officers on June 7, 2013, when 92 recruits were commissioned.McNeil, Andy (June 8, 2013). \\"Camden County police reach goal\\" . Courier-Post. The new force doubled the size of the previous city force. Thomson announced that officers would no longer be judged on how many tickets they wrote or arrests they made but on relationships they developed in the community and whether citizens felt safe enough to sit on their front steps or allow their children to ride their bikes in the street. Thomson told the New York Times in 2017 that \\"aggressive ticket writing\\" was a sign that officers weren't understanding the new department, saying \\"handing a $250 ticket to someone who is making $13,000 a year can be life altering.\\" On new recruits' first day, they knock on doors in the neighborhood they're assigned to and introduce themselves. The initial strategy was to have as many officers walking and biking the streets as possible to discourage drug traffickers; as citizens felt safer and began occupying public spaces again, a critical mass of well-intentioned citizens was sufficient to keep the drug traffickers away and police pulled back on their presence. Thomson also adopted new policies on use-of-force and \\"scoop and go\\", which instructs officers to load injured people into their cruisers to take them to the hospital if calling for an ambulance would cause a delay. The use-of-force policy, which the department had drafted with help from New York University Law School’s Policing Project and which was supported by the New Jersey ACLU and the Fraternal Order of Police, was called by experts the \\"most progressive\\" such policy to date, according to the Washington Post in 2019. As part of the overall strategy for the city, abandoned buildings being used as drug houses were torn down. On October 1, 2013, the results of a vote by County Police officers to unionize were announced. By a margin of two votes, the New Jersey Fraternal Order of Police (NJFOP) was selected to represent the officers. The previous month, superior officers voted to be represented by the NJFOP.McNeil, Andy. \\"Camden County Police unionize in close vote, Members join state FOP\\", Courier-Post, October 3, 2013. After the implementations both complaints of excessive force and violent crimes decreased. In 2019 Bloomberg reported that excessive force complaints had dropped by 95%. In 2020 CNN reported the violent crime rate had dropped by 42%. Sky Patrol In June 2013, the department deployed a mobile observation platform called \\"Sky Patrol,\\" which contains surveillance cameras and thermal imaging cameras and can be elevated into the air to help monitor crime. It was procured with $135,000 in forfeited funds. The maker of the system, FLIR Systems, claims that it can enable a single officer to see more than three- quarters of a mile (1.2 km) and oversee an area that would normally require five officers. A spokesman for the Camden County Prosecutor acknowledged that the system could see into homes.Charnet, Julie (June 4, 2013). \\"Police unveil 'Sky Patrol' post to monitor high-crime areas in Camden\\" .

Ambassadors On June 20, 2013, the Camden County Board of Chosen Freeholders approved the addition of a private force of civilian ambassadors to provide a security presence and serve as the eyes and ears of the police department in Camden's downtown shopping district.

The ships were required to reach a speed of during sea trials and carry an armament of a single QF 12 pounder 12 cwt ( calibre) gun, backed up by five 6-pounder guns, and two 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes. An arched turtleback forecastle was fitted. The ship had a crew of 63 officers and ratings. Tiger was launched on 19 May 1900. The ship was completed and accepted by the Royal Navy in June 1901. Service Tiger was commissioned at Devonport 21 August 1901, and assigned to the Portsmouth Flotilla of the Home Fleet. She spent her entire operational career in Home Waters. Tiger was paid off on 4 January 1902, when her crew was turned over to , which took her place in the Flotilla. On the night of 25 September 1907, Tiger ran aground on the breakwater of Portland Harbour tearing off a large length of the ship's keel and holing the ship. On 2 April 1908 Tiger took part in a Home Fleet exercise in the English Channel 18 miles south of the Isle of Wight. Part of the exercise was to test fleet defence against a torpedo boat night attack, with all ships running without lights. Tiger and were carrying out a mock torpedo attack when Tiger crossed the bow of , an armoured cruiser. Tiger was cut in two with the forward section sinking almost immediately. The stern remained afloat long enough to 22 members of her crew to be rescued, but 36 men, including Tigers captain, Lieutenant W.E. Middleton were lost.

The ninth system of the season, Haruna developed in the Mozambique channel in the middle of February 2013 between Mozambique and southwestern Madagascar. Initially moving northward over Mozambique, the disturbance later moved slowly southward, gradually strengthening into the eighth named storm of the season and later into an intense tropical cyclone. The Météo-France office in Réunion (MFR) - the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in the basin - estimated the cyclone attained peak 10 minute sustained winds of 150 km/h (90 mph). Haruna made landfall near Morombe in southwestern Madagascar on February 22\\\\. It weakened significantly while crossing the country, and MFR discontinued advisories on February 24 after the storm had emerged into the Indian Ocean. Before Haruna struck Madagascar, a pre-existing system produced deadly flooding, and when the cyclone crossed the country, it added additional rainfall to the region. Flooding was worst in Toliara where a dyke burst, flooding much of the town and leaving residents without water or power. Many villages in southwestern Madagascar lost access to clean water, prompting various international agencies to deploy teams to decontaminate wells. Haruna destroyed 7,402 houses, which left 13,882 people homeless. Most of the displaced people were able to leave their shelters by early April. The cyclone damaged rice and maize crops along the coast, although there were extended residual effects when a locust outbreak occurred, affecting half of Madagascar's farmlands by July 2013. Throughout Madagascar, Haruna killed 26 people and injured 127 directly, and there were outbreaks of various diseases in the storm's aftermath. Meteorological history In the middle of February, an area of convection, or thunderstorms, persisted in the Mozambique channel. It had an associated circulation and rainbands to the east of the center, and was related to the monsoon trough. The system was located within an area of warm sea surface temperatures of over and steadily decreasing wind shear. A ridge to the south caused the system to initially track to the north. By February 16, the system had moved over Mozambique and turned to the east, although by that time it had become better organized with the convection wrapping into the center. Subsequently, the system moved southward due to a weakness in the ridge, with conditions favorable for tropical cyclogenesis such as low wind shear and good divergence. On February 18, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert, and at 1200 UTC that day, Météo-France (MFR) initiated advisories on Tropical Disturbance 09. Upon being classified, the disturbance had a broad circulation that was difficult to locate, with moderate convection in its eastern periphery. The thunderstorms organized further, and MFR upgraded the disturbance to a tropical depression at 0000 UTC on February 19. Three hours later, the JTWC began issuing advisories on Tropical Cyclone 16S, and at 0600 UTC that day, MFR upgraded the depression to a moderate tropical storm after an advanced scatterometer indicated winds of over 65 km/h (40 mph); as a result, the National Weather Service of Madagascar gave it the name Haruna. By that time, the circulation had become better organized with increased rainbands, and with an anticyclone aloft, the storm developed well-defined outflow. The structure of Haruna continued to become more symmetrical with a large radius of maximum winds, developing a ragged eye early on February 20\\\\. Based on the improved appearance, MFR upgraded Haruna to a severe tropical storm at 0000 UTC that day. About 12 hours later, the agency upgraded Haruna further to tropical cyclone status, with 10 minute winds of 120 km/h (75 mph). That day, an approaching trough weakened the ridge to the south, causing the cyclone to slow and move erratically. While Haruna was approaching the southwestern coast of Madagascar, it developed a 120 km (75 mi) wide eye, and the eyewall passed over Europa Island. Initially, MFR estimated that the storm would intensify to intense tropical cyclone status, and the agency assessed that Haruna reached 10 minute winds of 150 km/h (90 mph) on February 20. The next day, JTWC estimated peak 1 minute winds of 185 km/h (115 mph). In contrast, MFR estimated at that time that the cyclone had peaked when the eyewall thunderstorms warmed, followed by the eye becoming less organized and the winds decreasing. While moving slowly to the east-southeast, Haruna re- intensified early on February 22 to its previous MFR peak intensity. At around 0230 UTC that day, the cyclone made landfall about 55 km (35 mi) south of Morombe in southwestern Madagascar. Haruna quickly weakened below cyclone status, and while over land it accelerated to the southeast. On February 23, Haruna weakened to an overland depression with 10 minute winds of around 45 km/h (30 mph). A few hours later, the system emerged into the Indian Ocean near Fort Dauphin as a tropical disturbance. With generally favorable conditions, convection reorganized slightly and the system redeveloped outflow to the south. Early on February 24, Haruna re-intensified into a moderate tropical storm, although soon after it weakened again due to cooler waters, increasing shear, and dry air. At 1200 UTC, MFR issued its last advisory after Haruna began losing tropical characteristics, designating it as a subtropical depression. The next day, the JTWC also discontinued advisories on the storm, noting that Haruna was dissipating about 665 km (415 mi) south-southwest of Réunion. Impact and aftermath Satellite image of Haruna over southern Madagascar on February 22 On Europa Island in the Mozambique Channel, Haruna produced wind gusts of 144 km/h (90 mph) during the passage of the eyewall. Before the cyclone struck Madagascar, the intertropical convergence zone had caused flooding in the country that killed four people and caused widespread road disruption. Officials prepared by collecting supplies in the capital Antananarivo beginning on February 20, and sending an emergency crew to the expected landfall location. Residents were evacuated using boats and canoes to shelters. For several days while offshore western Madagascar, Haruna dropped greater than normal rainfall. The storm ultimately made landfall about 15 hours faster than anticipated. Winds and rainfall from Haruna damaged houses and power systems, and also damaged 265 classrooms and 16 health facilities. There was also damage to the rice and maize crops from high winds near the coast, causing food shortages. Rains from the storm caused a dyke along the Fiherenana River to break, which flooded a large region and forced about 6,000 people to evacuate their homes. The flooding from the dyke break was worst in Toliara, where most residents lost access to fresh water and power. Flooding in the city caused the temporarily closure of the airport there. The town of Morombe was temporarily isolated after the road was blocked. Power outages affected Morombe, Toliara, Sakaraha, and Betioky Sud. Downed trees had affected roads near Toliara but were quickly removed. About 1,050 houses were flooded, another 691 lost their roofs, and 7,402 were destroyed, leaving 13,882 people homeless. Overall, Haruna killed 26 people and injured another 127. There were initial difficulties in distributing aid to areas of southwestern Madagascar due to prevailing unsettled weather, along with fuel shortages. Workers used boats to rescue people in flooded areas. Members of the Madagascar Armed Forces, along with about 200 Red Cross volunteers, assisted in evacuations and aid distribution, and the Red Cross also provided free medical consultations to thousands of people. Following the storm, there were increased levels of malaria, dysentery, and childhood diarrhea in the area around Toliara, and there was a locust outbreak. Increased locust activity persisted into the summer, and had been occurring since late 2012; this caused continued food shortages, and by July the locusts were affecting about half of the country's farmlands. To prevent further spreading of disease, officials provided vaccinations and sprayed insecticide. In isolated villages in southwestern Madagascar, residents faced food shortages, while in some areas, the water supply was contaminated. Within a few weeks of the storms, many residents whose dwellings were not destroyed were able to return to their homes. In Toliara, about 4,000 students were initially unable to return to school due to being displaced. In the middle of March, 1,948 displaced people stayed in a military camp or two schools, but most returned home by early April. Repairs to the dyke in Toliara began in early April, and were expected to take about a month and a half. On February 23, the prime minister of Madagascar issued an appeal to the international community for assistance. In Toliara, United Nations agencies, including the World Food Programme, and non-governmental organizations worked together to provide food for 3,000 people in six shelters. The World Food Programme sent a truck with 1,050 tons of food to Toliara, including corn and legumes. A few days after Haruna struck, the French Red Cross sent a ship to Toliara with 35 tons of supplies, including for housing and water. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies authorized funds to help up to 10,000 affected residents. Handicap International provided food and shelter to 547 people in Toliara. Action Against Hunger sent a plane with 15 tons of supplies, including water treatment units, to Madagascar after the storm. By March 20, 1,330 wells were disinfected by various crews. On March 1, the European Commission donated €200,000 for immediate relief. The Red Crescent Society of the United Arab Emirates sent about 80 tonnes of food, medicine, and building supplies to the country.

This examination is a prerequisite for entrance into almost all education institutions at the senior high school level, such as common senior high schools, secondary skill schools, vocational high schools, and technical high schools. It is usually taken by students in their last year of junior high school. Before the Senior High School Entrance Examination, every province will hold two simulation exams, and some provinces mandate three practice examinations. The Senior High School Entrance Examination problems are usually made by province, but few provinces delegate the power of creating problems to cities. This exam is the second examination system recovered after the Cultural Revolution. It takes place in early June every year, however in few place it takes place in late June or even early July. In 1980, the decades when the exams were recovered, the Graduation Examination of Junior High School and the Senior High School Entrance Examination were the same exam. If the students failed the Senior High School Entrance Examination, then they could not graduate from the junior high school, even if there was a senior high school that would admit them. These students were refused by all senior high schools because of \\"failure in graduation from junior high school\\" (初中肄业), which is what is commonly called “sending back the document” (退档). However some places had a system to makeup the Senior High School Entrance Examination. Since mid-1990s, the Graduation Examination of Junior High School has become separated from the Senior High School Entrance Examination, but some provinces and cities (such as Shanghai) the two exams are still combined.

Fakara Plants. Japan International Research Center for Agricultural Sciences. Description This species is an annual grass growing up to 70 centimeters tall. The narrow leaves are up to 20 centimeters long. Both stem and foliage usually have scattered glandular pits; when the species is divided into varieties, the abundance of the pits helps to distinguish them. The ligule is a short fringe of hairs. The inflorescence is an open panicle with branches each up to 10 centimeters long. The lowest branches are whorled about the stem. The narrow, grayish to purple-green spikelets are up to a centimeter long and each can contain up to 10 to 17 florets. Habitat and dispersal This grass can be found in a variety of habitat types, easily taking hold in disturbed areas such as roadsides and crop fields. It grows well in moist and wet habitat, including swamps. It is spread by seed, which is transported by water and wind, in soil and hay, and on machinery and trains. It likely has a long-lasting soil seed bank.Li, X., et al. (2006). Germination strategy and ecological adaptability of Eragrostis pilosa. (Chinese) Ying Yong Sheng Tai Xue Bao 17(4) 607-10. Uses The grass has some value as a forage and fodder.Eragrostis pilosa (L.) Beauv. - Jersey Love-grass. AgroAtlas: Interactive Agricultural Ecological Atlas of Russia and Neighboring Countries. The grain is edible by humans. Teff This grass is also of interest in agriculture because it is the main wild ancestor of teff (Eragrostis tef), a staple cereal in some regions and of particular importance in Ethiopia. The close connection between the two grasses is supported by genetic evidence. They are also very similar in morphology, sometimes indistinguishable. The most consistent difference is that E. pilosa undergoes spikelet shattering, the disintegration of the seedhead that is the first step in seed dispersal. Teff heads do not shatter, making the plant easier to manage as an agricultural crop. E. pilosa has been occasionally harvested as a grain in Ethiopia, but only in times of desperation.Ingram, A. L. and J. J. Doyle. (2003). The origin and evolution of Eragrostis tef (Poaceae) and related polyploids: evidence from nuclear waxy and plastid rps16. American Journal of Botany 90(1) 116-22. The majority of Eragrostis species are polyploid, with more than two sets of chromosomes; E. pilosa is an allotetraploid, containing the genes of other species, suggesting it is of hybrid origin. Teff is also allotetraploid. Fertile hybrids between the two have been bred. Ecology This grass can be infested with the parasitic plant purple witchweed (Striga hermonthica).Watling, J. R. and M. C.

It tells of a love triangle between two brothers, born to a commoner, and a noble woman. Plot On the island of Nusa Penida, two common-born brothers (Jaya and I Pageh) are friends with Pandansari, daughter of the king. When the king is murdered, Pandansari goes into hiding with her father's loyal manservant I Murda. Jaya, I Pageh, and Pandansari are soon entangled in a love triangle, one which is rendered more difficult owing to differences in caste. Ultimately, after rumors emerge that Jaya has been killed, Pandansari chooses I Pageh. Production The Teng Chun Noesa Penida was produced by The Teng Chun for his company New Java Industrial Film (New JIF). It was written and directed by Andjar Asmara, a former journalist and stage-writer who had made his directorial debut the preceding year with Kartinah.; HB Angin handled artistic direction. Andjar and his wife, Ratna, each earned 1,000 gulden for their roles in the film; this was several times the wages of Roekiah and Kartolo, stars at New JIF's competitor Tan's Film. The film starred Ratna Asmara, as well as Astaman, Rd Ismail, and Ali Joego. Ratna and Astaman, both with a background as stage performers, had previously worked with Andjar in Kartinah. Release and reception Noesa Penida was released in 1941. A 35 mm copy of the film is stored at Sinematek Indonesia in Jakarta. Noesa Penida has been adapted several times. During its initial run it was brought to the stage by various troupes. From 30 June to 14 September 1942 Andjar published a serialization of the film in the newspaper Asia Raja. It was compiled as a novel in 1950. The film was remade in 1988 as Noesa Penida (Pelangi Kasih Pandansari) (Noesa Penida (Pandansari's Rainbow of Love)).

Jain) (born 30 September 1930) is an Indian mathematician who specialised in numerical solutions of partial differential equations. He was awarded in 1975 the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, the highest science award in India, in the mathematical sciences category. Jain has done important work on the development of algorithms for solving non-linear problems involving irregular boundaries. Algorithms based on finite difference technique, finite element technique and quasilinearization and invariant embedding have been developed and applied to various problems in fluid dynamics. These techniques have added to the existing knowledge on fluid dynamics and its applications and hold promise of enabling applied mathematicians and scientists to solve still more difficult non-linear problems. His work is likely to be of value in finding solutions for problems of stability and turbulence in fluid dynamics, numerical weather forecasting and magnetohydrodynamic power generation.

The following year she joined Hugo Dumas' troupe Lief Java. During this period she became active in film. In 1938 she provided vocals for Fatima, a production by Tan's Film; she provided vocals again for Tan's 1939 film Gagak Item (Black Raven). She made her onscreen debut later that year, with Siti Akbari. In 1940 she appeared in two further films, Sorga Ka Toedjoe (Seventh Heaven) and Roekihati. Landouw's prowess singing keroncong rendered her immensely popular. In 1940, the blind singer was scheduled for eye surgery. Her fans organised a fundraising campaign to help her pay for it, although ultimately Landouw refused the charity. After Indonesia's independence, Landouw continued singing; however, she acted in no further films. She died on 17 August 1982. Legacy Music scholar Peter Keppy suggests that, because of her popularity as a keroncong singer, Landouw may have influenced the character of Yah in Armijn Pane's 1940 novel Belenggu; in the novel, Yah is famous as a keroncong singer under the stage name Siti Hayati.

It is found in shallow water in Southeast Asia and northeastern Australia. It is an unusual species in that it can reproduce sexually or can split in two by fission to form two new individuals. As a result, it has varying numbers of arms, and Hubert Lyman Clark, writing in 1938, stated, \\"It is a literal truth that no two of the 56 specimens at hand, nearly all from Lord Howe Island, are exactly alike in number, size and form of arms\\". Description Nepanthia belcheri is a small starfish with broad arms with rounded tips. Small specimens tend to have five arms, while larger ones have six or seven, although the number of arms can range from one or two to 10. When 12 months old, the length of an arm is typically , after two years it is , in the third year it reaches and in the fourth . N. belcheri is a muddy brown colour. Distribution Nepanthia belcheri is native to the Pacific coast of Australia from the Low Islands in Queensland to Port Jackson in New South Wales. It also occurs in Southeast Asia and is found under boulders and rubble where conditions are muddy, from the intertidal zone down to a depth of about 45 m (150 ft). Biology Nepanthia belcheri is a hermaphrodite and can reproduce both sexually and asexually. The gonads generally produce oocytes, but in some, no spermatogenic material is present, so they function as ovaries, while others produce sperm and function as testes. Sexual reproduction takes place in October and November. The eggs have large yolk sacs so the larvae are probably lechithotrophic, living on the nutrients already present in the eggs. Reproducing sexually allows the species to disperse to new locations in a way it could not do if it relied entirely on asexual reproduction. The lifespan is at least four years. During its second and third years, when it is actively growing and its arm length is either about 15 or 22 mm, N. belcheri can reproduce by fragmentation. A furrow appears on the disc which gradually deepens, and the two sides of the starfish pull away from each other. The disc is torn into two portions and over time, new arms grow on each section. As a result, the new individuals are asymmetric and often have six or seven arms of varying lengths. The original arms grow more slowly than the new ones so that, by the time the arm length reaches 27 mm, all the arms are much the same length. After fission, the gonads regress and individuals that previously had mature female gonads become masculinized, developing male-type gonads. Many larger individuals provide evidence from the varying lengths of their arms that they have divided by fission on several different occasions.

It is owned and operated by Omnitrans, the area's public transportation agency. The station is served by Metrolink trains and various bus services, including the sbX bus rapid transit line. It is a planned terminus of the Arrow commuter rail line. History and future development Pacific Electric (PE) and its local predecessors used the SBTC site as a tram shed in the early 1900s, and later Upland–San Bernardino Line trains terminated here. Omnitrans selected the site to build the center in the 2000s, and purchased the land for the station from Union Pacific Railroad, the successor corporation to Pacific Electric, in 2008. HDR, Inc.'s bid to design the center was chosen by San Bernardino Associated Governments, the area regional planning organization, in 2010. By 2011, the expected completion date of the associated sbX system was in 2014. By March 2010, an extension of Metrolink rail from San Bernardino's Santa Fe Depot to the center was planned to be completed by 2013; by early 2014, the completion date had been moved to mid-2016. Construction of the center began in 2014, with a groundbreaking of the location on February 25. The sbX line opened on April 28, 2014, however, the rest of the transit center was under construction. The center opened on September 8, 2015; at that point, the rail project was scheduled to be completed by 2017. Construction on the extension continued through 2017. Passenger service began on December 16, 2017; news reports described the initial service as \\"test runs\\" with an official opening date of December 18. Arrow (formerly known as the Redlands Passenger Rail Project) service will terminate at the transit center upon the commencement of operations in 2022. That project's contracting process was incorporated into the work done on bringing Metrolink service to the station. A new platform and pocket track will be built south of existing platforms to facilitate the service. The California High-Speed Rail Authority is considering the station as a possible stop on the second phase of the California High-Speed Rail project.  Services and facilities  San Bernardino Line trains, IEOC Line trains, and sbX bus rapid transit stop at the center. Additionally, Omnitrans, Mountain Transit, Pass Transit, the Riverside Transit Agency, and VVTA use the center as a bus depot. The center contains a LEED Gold station building with public facilities, waiting areas, and solar panels on its roof. 19 bus bays are located within the center, with two additional stops and sbX platforms at the northeast corner. Metrolink double track and platforms parallel the south edge. A mural titled Explorations is on the exterior of the station building, and a large sundial is at the center of the bus area.

Paysage coloré aux oiseaux aquatiques is a Proto-Cubist work executed in a Post-Divisionist style with a unique Fauve-like palette. Metzinger's broad omnidirectional brushstrokes in the treatment of surfaces render homage to Paul Cézanne, while the luscious subtropical imagery in the painting are an homage to Paul Gauguin and Metzinger's friend Henri Rousseau. Paysage coloré aux oiseaux aquatiques is located at the Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris.Jean Metzinger, Paysage coloré aux oiseaux aquatiques, Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris Description Paysage coloré aux oiseaux aquatiques is an oil painting on canvas in a horizontal format with dimensions 75.5 x 101 cm (29.7 by 39.8 in). The work represents three aquatic birds in an ambrosial Mediterranean landscape with semi-tropical vegetation, trees, a body of water, mountains and a sailboat in the background. The free and expressive brushstrokes of Paysage coloré aux oiseaux aquatiques—as in Les Ibis and Le Flamant rose et le voilier of the same period—represent a loosening of the mosaic-like Divisionist technique that characterized Metzinger's work from 1905 to early 1907.Joann Moser, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, Pre-Cubist works, 1904–1909, The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, 1985, pp. 34-42 By 1907 a select group of avant-garde artists in Paris were reevaluating their own work in relation to that of Paul Cézanne. A retrospective of Cézanne's paintings had been held at the Salon d'Automne of 1904. Current works were displayed at the 1905 and 1906 Salon d'Automne, followed by two commemorative retrospectives after his death in 1907. Metzinger's interest in the work of Cézanne suggests a means by which he made the transformation from Divisionism to Cubism. The lattices of squares or 'cubes' of paint employed throughout his Divisionist period have not been entirely abandoned, but pushed to another extreme. Where before brushstrokes had become increasingly larger and organized into groups of color, now they were larger still and elongated, seemingly blended together directly on the canvas (rather than on a palette). The treatment of color and composition is globally free, loose, expressive, and thus dynamic. There are no inert tones. Colors have retained their brilliance. As before, contrasting hues are placed side by side—resulting in rhythmic and optic vibrational effects.Jean Metzinger: Divisionism, Cubism, Neoclassicism and Post-Cubism The lines and large strokes of color, like words, are treated autonomously—each possessing an abstract value independent of one another, yet together forming a coherent whole. The impulse toward abstraction becomes a primary quality of Metzinger's work of 1907. Though not without reference to the real world, Metzinger's treatment of the painted surface is meant to draw away from the outward appearance of nature. Imitation is vacated in order to concentrate upon the distillation of essential shapes and movements. These distilled forms were superior to nature because they partook of idea, and represented the dominance of the artist over the mere stuff of nature.Daniel Robbins, Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism, 1985, in Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, The University of Iowa Museum of Art Complex in both composition and the rendering of color, the subject matter of Paysage coloré, though clearly readable, is to a certain extent faceted and denaturalized. Its combination of painterly techniques, color and exoticism in its subject matter, sets it apart, resulting in a broader scope typically employed to define the Fauve movement. The spatial relationships between forms in the foreground and structures in the background are ambiguously flattened. Metzinger had already abandoned classical perspective for the most part since 1903, and now it had become entirely irrelevant. This composition was not only different from Paul Cézanne, Georges Seurat, Henri-Edmond Cross, Paul Sérusier, Maurice Denis and Odilon Redon and the other Neo-Impressionists, Symbolists and Nabis, but different from Henri Matisse, André Derain, Othon Friesz and the other Fauves. Indeed, Metzinger, unlike others of his immediate circle, or peripheral entourage, would soon become one of the founders of Cubism—flanked between Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque on the one hand, Albert Gleizes, Henri Le Fauconnier, Robert Delaunay, Fernand Léger on the other—and this painting was a step in that direction.

He was imprisoned in the United States between 1911 and 1914 due to violations of U.S. neutrality laws. He published Regeneración, the official newspaper of the MLP, before and after his imprisonment. Biography In September 1910, Figueroa was put in charge of the publication of Regeneración in Los Angeles, California.

The document took an openly anarchocommunist stance toward the armed uprisings in Mexico at the time. At the time of the uprisings, Regeneración generated about US$1,000 per week in subscription fees. Even after covering its publication costs, several hundred dollars per week were made available for MLP revolutionary causes. Smaller sums of money were received from outside donors to the organization.

This work is held in the collection of the Museum Ludwig. The title comes from the onomatopoeic graphics that depict the sound that comes from a machine gun. Background The source of Takka Takka is Battlefield Action #40 (c), February 1962, Charlton Comics Group. Lichtenstein was a trained United States Army pilot, draftsman and artist as well as a World War II (WWII) veteran who never saw active combat. The work depicts a machine gun firing as it is situated above the camouflage of palm fronds during the Battle of Guadalcanal. The image shows shell casings and a grenade in mid flight. An explosion is stylized with the titular phrase. The source of Takka Takka is the comic book Battlefield Action #40 (February 1962, Charlton Comics Group). Lichtenstein's reinterpretation of the original comic image eliminates the horizon line and other indications of depth of field. He also eliminates the human element by removing a hand, a helmet and the Japanese rising sun emblem. Lichtenstein in 1967 When the characters in some of his works, e.g. Takka Takka, Whaam! and Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!, were criticised for being militaristic, Lichtenstein responded: \\"the heroes depicted in comic books are fascist types, but I don't take them seriously in these paintings—maybe there is a point in not taking them seriously, a political point. I use them for purely formal reasons.\\" Critical response The Washingtonian critic Sophie Gilbert, regards Takka Takka (along with Bratatat!) as exemplary of Lichtenstein's \\"aggressive, hyper-masculine war paintings\\" due to the depiction of the guns creating sound effects and the use of onomatopoeic words during military conflict. Takka Takka, with its disruption of the primary narrative clause by text focused on absent details about the past or omitted present, is described as \\"the most unlikely conjunction of picture and story\\". The work is regarded as one in which Lichtenstein exaggerated comic book sound effects in common pop art style. In the view of critic Steven Weisenburger, Lichtenstein's reimagining creates a tension between the narrative and graphical content because the \\"exhausted soldiers\\" are absent. Takka Takka is a subversion of the interpretive conventions of \\"pop\\" culture, \\"but more important, it interrogates a shared idea about war, that war's sublime violence heroizes.\\" Implicitly comparing Takka Takka to Picasso's Guernica, art historian Klaus Honnef states that the work's use of the \\"cartoon idiom in combination with elements of written language\\" demonstrates that art does not have to present the horrors of war graphically in order to be forceful.

A Republican, Schaefer is assigned to the Defense & Veterans' Affairs and Urban Affairs committees. He ran without Democratic opposition in his successful bid for a fourth legislative term in the general election held on November 6, 2018. Schaefer defeated Neal Katz, an independent, 37,056 (75.6 percent) to 11,929 (24.4 percent).  Background  Schaefer attended Cisco College in Cisco, Texas, where he played football. Then he attended Texas Tech University in Lubbock, where he obtained a bachelor's degree in finance and a J.D. degree from Texas Tech University School of Law.  Political career  In 1999, he worked on staff in Tyler for U.S. Senator Phil Gramm. Upon Gramm's retirement, Schaefer joined the Navy Reserves and attended law school at Texas Tech University. Schaefer subsequently served as counsel to the chairman of the Sunset Advisory Commission, state representative Carl Isett, on bills regarding insurance and transportation. Schafer was first elected to the Texas House of Representatives in November 2012. In the 2012 primary election, he had successfully challenged incumbent representative Leo Berman. Schaeffer unseated Berman in the Republican primary election held on May 29, 2012. He received 11,138 votes, or 57.7 percent, to Berman's 8,172 votes (42.3 percent). Schaefer was unopposed in the November general election.  Political positions  =Reproductive health= In 2015, Schaefer put forward Amendment 18 to the Texas Health and Safety Code, attaching it to CSHB 2510. The amendment addressed the legality of terminating a pregnancy when in utero testing yields \\"a severe and irreversible fetal abnormality\\" diagnosis. Schaefer's position was one in defense of all life, asserting that the disabled deserve the same protection inside the womb that they receive once born. Representative Spitzer, a doctor, argued for the amendment, saying, \\"We want them [mothers, parents] to be able to have that child and have that grieving process.\\" Representative Sheffield, also a doctor, disagreed, saying, \\"[A]s a doctor—for my patients it is unethical for we doctors to impose upon them a set of guidelines that forces them in one direction or another, taking away their rights.\\" Schaefer's amendment passed with a solid majority, but Democrats halted passage of the whole bill using a technical objection. When the bill returned to the House floor weeks later, it had been re-written to such a degree that Schaefer's amendment would no longer be \\"germane,\\" or topically relevant to the bill and was not able to be attached. In 2013, Schaefer voted for Texas Senate Bill 5, which required doctors who provide abortion services to be registered at hospitals within 30 miles of their office. =Gun control= In 2019, following two mass shootings in Texas, Schaefer tweeted his vehement opposition to increasing restrictions such as universal background checks, bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazine purchases, and mandatory gun buybacks. Instead, he advocates for prayer and discipline in the home, as well as the right to carry for law- abiding single mothers. This was tweeted a day after mass shootings occurred in the Midland-Odessa area of Texas with 7 fatalities, including one law enforcement officer; and, one day before new Texas laws went into effect to \\"ease restrictions on guns, including allowing firearms in public places like schools and churches, on rented and leased property and during disasters.\\" 2014 election Schaefer won renomination to a second term to the District 6 House seat in the Republican primary, held March 4, 2014.

In 2017 it reported that 236 people were supported in facilities such as residential homes, supported living and activity and resource centres across the south of England. From 2013, SeeAbility launched its Children in Focus campaign, providing sight tests for children in special schools, after observing that many adults they worked with had not received good eye care when younger. History The school was founded in 1799 by four philanthropists: London banker Samuel Bosanquet, Thomas Boddington, James Ware (an eye surgeon), and William Houlston (a charity worker). Its original name was The School for the Indigent Blind, and it was established at St George's Fields, Southwark with the intention of educating young blind people and teaching them useful trades. From the 1860s, it was thought that the school should be moved to \\"another site more contributive to the health of the inmates and the advantage of the Charity\\". In 1900, the school committee purchased 15 acres of land in Leatherhead at a cost of £4,000 and C. Pemberton Leach was appointed as architect. Work began on the new school building in May 1901 and the foundation stone was laid by Princess Helena on 13 November. King George V granted the school royal patronage in 1911, and it was renamed The Royal School for the Blind. It consisted of residential workshops and when the Second World War began it was requisitioned by King's College Hospital as a national emergency hospital. The school underwent rapid change in the 1970s when the accommodation was transformed with individual bedrooms instead of communal dormitories. The new, modernised building was formally opened by Diana, Princess of Wales in November 1982. In the 1990s the school widened its remit to include people with other physical and learning disabilities and expanded its services to reach out to people in their own homes. It changed its name to SeeAbility in 1994, and adopted the ethos 'Seeing beyond disability'. The organisation expanded to numerous sites across the south of England during the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s, opening sites in Maidstone, Seaford, Eastleigh, Oxfordshire, Devon, Horley, Tadley, Aldershot and more. In 1999 SeeAbility opened a residential nursing service called Heather House In Tadley that was built specifically to support 16 younger adults with the very rare, degenerative Juvenile Batten Disease. The service is considered one of the leading providers for people with Juvenile Batten Disease, where the people supported live on average 3-4 years longer than at other services. Since opening, the service has supported almost 30 people with the disease. In 2013 it launched the Children in Focus campaign, carrying out sight tests in special schools and calling for wide-ranging reforms to eye care for people with learning disabilities and autism. The organisation claims to be the biggest global study on the eye care needs of children with learning disabilities, after carrying out eye tests on over a 1000 children in special schools. In 2017, SeeAbility underwent a brand refresh and changed its strapline to 'Extraordinary every day'. The new logo reduced the size of 'See' and emphasized 'Ability' to reflect its shift in focus from sight loss to the intersection between sight loss and learning disability. Children in Focus The Children in Focus campaign was launched in 2013 in four special schools to carry out eye tests on children with learning disabilities and autism. By 2017 it was carrying out eye tests in 8 London schools and a school in Manchester. The charity claims to be the biggest global study on the eye care needs of people with learning disabilities and autism. In its four year report, Children in Focus - a clear call to action, SeeAbility published its findings, which showed that children with learning disabilities are 28 times more likely to have a sight problem, but much less likely to receive eye care. Nearly half (47.5) had a problem with their vision, a third (31.7%) needed glasses, over four in ten (43.7%) had no history of any eye care and only 7% had ever used a community optician. Of the children with a sight problem, more than a quarter had a problem that was not previously known. In the 2019 NHS England long term plan, it was announced that the NHS would provide sight and dental testing for all children in special schools across England. This came as a direct result of campaigning by SeeAbility, and SeeAbility are to be involved in its implementation. It is the only known example of a charity successfully campaigning for a change in NHS policy. Supporters and ambassadors In 1982, Princess Diana became the patron of SeeAbility and made a number of visits to their services until stepping down in 1996. Since 1999 Birgitte, Duchess of Gloucester has been the Patron. The current president is Lord Coe and the vice-president is former Prime Minister Sir John Major. In November 2017 the charity organised a fundraising stand-up night with comedians Sally Phillips, Jo Brand and Adam Hills. In the 2018 New Year's Honours, SeeAbility Eye Care and Vision Development Officer Scott Watkin was awarded a BEM for his work with the charity. In 2020 SeeAbility appointed their first two celebrity patrons, Amar Latif and Helen Fospero.

History In 1869 the New Zealand Government provided the capital for the creation of the New Zealand Government Life Insurance Department (better known simply as Government Life). It became TOWER Corporation in 1987 at a time when several New Zealand government departments and organisations were being corporatized or converted into state owned enterprises. Three years later, ownership of TOWER was transferred to policyholder as the business was mutualised. Being a mutual caused difficulties in raising capital and nine years later, in 1999, TOWER demutualised and listed on the stock exchange. Seven years later, and further change as TOWER's Australian and New Zealand operations were separated. =Diversification from plain life insurance= In 1989 Tower bought National Insurance Company of New Zealand Limited which from its Head Office in Dunedin, where it was founded in 1873, had spread its operations throughout the world. National Insurance had bought the failed Standard Insurance Company Limited in 1961.Hocken Collections ref#ARC-0488 These businesses provided Tower's fire and general insurance divisions. Today The company still trades today, with a gross profit for the six months to 31 March 2013 of $44.2 million. In line with many other New Zealand insurance companies, TOWER announced on 10 April 2013 that it was moving away from full replacement house policies towards nominated sum insured covers, blaming international reinsurers. TOWER is still in a state of change however, and in 2012 TOWER sold both its medical insurance (TOWER Medical Insurance Limited) and its investment (TOWER Managed Funds Limited) divisions. This was followed in 2013 with the sale of TOWER's life insurance business. Government Life postage stamps A unique (in New Zealand) feature of the Government Life office was its use of custom postage stamps, first issues in 1891. This was the result of a dispute between the office and the New Zealand Post and Telegraph Department over the correct calculation of postage costs. All issues featured lighthouses, either in abstract designs or specific lighthouses from around New Zealand. New designs were issued in 1905, 1947 (surcharged at the time of decimalisation in 1967), 1969, and 1981. Use of these stamps was finally withdrawn in 1989.

It was one of the finest luxury hotels in North America. During World War II, it closed and the building was leased to the United States Navy. It was first used by the Navy as a school where enlisted men spent the second, third, and fourth months of an eleven-month course being trained as electronic technicians. Later the Hotel Del Monte became the Naval Postgraduate School. Today, the building is called Herrmann Hall. It contains school administrative offices and the Navy Gateway Inns and Suites, a hotel. History Original hotel, 1883 255x255px Charles Crocker, one of California's Big Four railroad barons, established the resort through Southern Pacific Railroad's property division, Pacific Improvement Company, and opened the first hotel June 3, 1880. The first true resort complex in the United States, it was an immediate success. Nearby, along Monterey Bay, was a railroad depot where the Del Monte (named for the hotel) served patrons arriving by train. The property extended south and southeast of the hotel and included gardens, parkland, polo grounds, a race track, and a golf course. Originally used for hunting and other outdoor activities, the hotel's property became Pebble Beach, an unincorporated resort community, and the world-famous Pebble Beach Golf Links. The famous 17-Mile Drive was originally designed as a local excursion for visitors to the Del Monte to take in the historic sights of Monterey and Pacific Grove and the scenery of what would become Pebble Beach.The Hotel Del Monte, California's Most Historic Resort' Publisher: Naval Postgraduate School The hotel became popular with the wealthy and influential of the day, and guests included Theodore Roosevelt and Ernest Hemingway, as well as many early Hollywood stars. On February 27, 1919 Samuel Finley Brown Morse formed the Del Monte Properties Company, and acquired the extensive holdings of the Pacific Improvement Company, which included the Del Monte Forest, the Del Monte Lodge (since renamed the Lodge at Pebble Beach), and the Hotel Del Monte.Pebble Beach Company History The hotel's shops included branches of Gump's, I.

The first building was designed by architect Arthur Brown, Sr., who had been the Southern Pacific Railroad's Superintendent of Bridges and Buildings. It was destroyed by fire on June 1, 1887 and was replaced. Two guests were killed and the hotel damaged in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. On September 27, 1924, the second Hotel Del Monte building was destroyed by fire. The current building dates from 1926. It was designed by architects Lewis P. Hobart and Clarence A. Tantau. The Hotel’s famed Art Gallery, which was established in 1907 and quickly became the venue for California's most prestigious artists, was also rebuilt; according to the detailed eyewitness account of Carmel artist Jennie V. Cannon, the space for exhibiting art was expanded. An online facsimile of the entire text of Vol. 1 is posted on the Traditional Fine Arts Organization website (). The Old Del Monte golf course opened in 1897 and is the oldest continuously operating golf course west of the Mississippi River. The Hotel Del Monte was requisitioned by the Navy at the beginning of World War II and used as a pre-flight training school. In 1947, the U.S. Navy purchased the hotel and its surrounding 627 acres for $2.5 million. In 1951 the United States Naval Academy's postgraduate school moved from Annapolis, Maryland, to its new location—the former Hotel del Monte. The hotel is now Herrmann Hall, the central building of the Naval Postgraduate School. 252x252px Also on the grounds are nine additional structures including the Roman Plunge Pool Complex, built in 1918 and designed by Hobart and Tantau, later the architects of the third hotel building. The pool itself was designed by Hobart. The Roman Plunge Solarium was restored in 2012 by architect James D. McCord. At that time the main Plunge was reconstructed as a reflecting pool and its original above-ground finishes restored.California Preservation Foundation award 2012 The Arizona Garden (1882), originally designed by landscape architect Rudolph Ulrich, is also on the grounds. Humorist Josh Billings died at the hotel in 1885.

Plot When Lam Ting-yat was little, his father died and he was raised by police officer Uncle Pau and was very close to his son Ngan Kwok just like brothers. Now Kwok has become a police inspector who just came back to Hong Kong after training in the Scotland Yard and Ting is a triad member working for crime lord Yeung Tung-hoi. Despite being on the opposite side of the law, they still maintain a close relationship. When Kwok came back to Hong Kong, he and his father and Ting had dinner and afterwards they went out and competed on who can pee the longest in an alley. There, they see a police officer Shek, nicknamed Portuguese, harass a call girl and Ting fights with him and Kwok helps him and cuffs Shek on a cart and pushes him down the alley. The next day Kwok reports to the police and is given a case of investigating Yeung's gang and Shek, who has been following this case, was assigned as his subordinate to assist him. In the files, Kwok also sees a file of Ting. Later, on a ship, Ting meets a singer girl named Peggy who asks him to use his phone and offers to pay him two dollars for using his phone. However, she did not have money at that time and saves it as a debt. Ting, Kwok and Pau go to a temple where Pau pays respect to Ting's father and asking for his blessing of Ting being safe, Kwok being promoted soon and his own health since his suffers from heart disease. Outside of the temple, Kwok asks Ting about his boss being involved in drug trafficking which Ting replies he does not know about it. Kwok tells Ting that he is not asking for tips from him but is trying to help him and not arrest him one day. Ting tells him about his plan to emigrated to America and jokingly asks him to teach him English. Before leaving, Ting goes back inside the temple and kneels in front of his father's grave. Afterwards, Ting goes to a private hospital and gives HK100,000 to the doctor to do surgery for Pau but also tells him to not tell Pau that the money came from him. Ting then goes to his boss Yeung and tells of his plan to quit the triads and emigrate to America and Yeung tells him he will ask his underling Paul to help him deal with his immigration procedure. Afterwards, Ting goes down to his car where his parking meter just expired and Peggy was just there to pay it for him. Peggy says that she owed him two dollars last time and paid four dollars for the parking meter, which makes Ting owe her two dollars now. Ting offers Peggy a ride to her outdoor concert which she refuses and prefers to ride the train instead. While Peggy was riding on the train, Ting follows her in his car. At the concert, Peggy trips and falls on stage which saddens her when everyone boos at her. Peggy goes to the side and cries, until Ting comes by and consoles her and takes her out to dinner and stay overnight at his house. At the same time, someone also attempted to assassinate Yeung where he was stabbed on his hips. In the morning, Peggy unsuccessfully attempts to make breakfast at Ting's house and burns the food and offers him a piece of chocolate for breakfast which Ting replies he wants congee and youtiao. When Peggy is about to leave, Ting gives her a watch to which Peggy replies that they are \\"common friends, easy come easy go\\". Later, Kwok comes up to Ting's house where he buys him breakfast and makes coffee and sees Peggy, who attempts to leave through the back door. Kwok asks him whether it is his girlfriend to which Ting replies \\"common friend, easy come, easy go\\". He then proceeds to tell Kwok his plans to emigrate to America next week. Later, Ting goes to a facial center where Peggy works and gives her several boxes of chocolate. She refuses it in front of him and gives it to her fat colleague but takes a bite at one when Ting leaves and he sees her doing so. At Yeung's estate, he wants Ting to settle a problem with rival Fung which Ting refuses due to sticking to principles. When everyone blames Ting to be a defector, he decides to help his boss and brings his underlings Ka-lok and Chan Kwo with him. Later, it is revealed that the assassination attempt was set up by Yeung so Ting would help him. When Ting and his crew make it to Fung's place, Ting and Kwo goes up and asks Ka-lok to wait in the car. While discussing with Fung, Ting and Fung get into a heated argument when Fing wants a bigger piece of the pie and Ting beats Fung's head on the table which then all of Fung's henchmen drew their guns at Ting. Fung asks Ting where is Yeung's cocaine, which the latter refuses to tell and Fung then ties up Kwo and beats him with a hammer. Ka-lok hears noise from downstairs and proceeds to get guns and alcohol from his trunk while also seeing his mother in the streets, who have not seen him in a while. After a brief talk with his mother, Ka-lok proceeds to go up the building and comes in and throws the alcohol which causes a fire and shoots at Fung's henchmen. After Ka-lok runs out of ammunition, one of Fung's henchmen shot and killed him which then Ting fights the henchmen and stabs him with a dart before killing him with his gun. Fung escapes by jumping out the window to the next floor and Ting chases him by jumping down floor by floor to the street and finally confront him and shoots him multiple times to death. Afterwards, Ting gives a call to Peggy who then goes to his house and treat his injuries. There, she cries and tells him that her heart aches while seeing him bleeding. Ting asks her that she said \\"easy come, easy go\\", but Peggy finally confesses that she loves him. At the police station, Sergeant Shek tells Commander Chan Chung-hon that he found evidence that Ting killed Fung. Commander Chan then gives permission to Shek to arrest Ting. When Shek and his crew arrive at Ting's house, Peggy tries to stop them but is beaten up by them and Ting escapes through the back door to the top of the building. Ting manages to overpower Shek's crew and then Shek holds Peggy hostage at the top of the building. Ting then hits Shek's gun away with a metal pole and fights with him until Shek is about to fall off the edge of the building. Shek begs for Ting's help and offers a deal to not arrest him if he saves him and Ting tries to pull him up. At that time, Kwok also comes to his house and seeing it all messed up with the window broken and some blood, he comes to the top of the building and sees Ting where he says he will arrest him for killing a police officer. After pulling Shek up, Shek proceeds to fight Ting where Kwok helps Ting to fend him off. Kwok then points his gun towards Ting where Shek tries to hit him with a metal pole from behind which then Ting kicks him off the building but landed on the air conditioners. When Kwok tries to arrest Ting, Peggy takes the metal pole and hits Kwok's back and she and Ting leave. At the police station, Commander Chan demotes Kwok after knowing about his close relationship with Ting and after reading Shek's report stating he saw Kwok letting Ting go. After leaving his office, Shek comes by and humiliates Kwok, who proceeds to fight with him before being stopped by his colleagues. Kwok then goes to a private restaurant where Yeung and his underling Fat Ko Wai are eating and attempts to arrest Yeung before being kicked out by the manager since he does not have a warrant. The next day, Ting goes to the estate of Yeung, who gives him a large sum of money to illegally enter Brazil, to which Ting asks Yeung to give half of the money to Ka-lok and Kwo's families. Yeung then expresses he does not want Ting to leave and tells him to take care. Ting then tells Peggy his plan to go Brazil and cannot take her with him since he is a wanted criminal and does not know what will happen. Peggy then convinces Ting to take her with him by stating she wants to start a new life with him and if he lives, he would have no friends, and Shek would kill her if he tries to find him. Ting finally agrees to take her with him and tells her he will go pick her up at 3 AM after visiting Uncle Pau. At Pau's house, while he was fixing something, Ting knocks but ignores him to which then Ting climbs in. Ting then apologizes to Pau and gives him a sum of money which Pau refuses and states that Ting needs it more than himself. At first, Pau refuses to let Ting in the house and close the window shades but he was actually trying to hide Ting and lets him in and tells him to leave through the back door as there are people spying on him outside. He tells him to not trust anyone and depend on himself. Before leaving, Ting puts the money on top of a shelf. Then, Shek comes by and attempts to search the house without a warrant. Pau attempts to stop him but Shek pushes him away and tries to find Ting. Later, Pau unsuccessfully try to tackle Shek and Shek leaves. Ting comes back in the house and sees Pau having a heart attack and Ting gives him his medicine while trying to leave the house to the hospital, Shek comes back and Ting begs Shek to allow him to take Pau to the hospital. When Shek refuses, he tries beat him and Pau bites his leg and Ting pushes him to a rake where he was stabbed to death. Ting then takes Pau to the hospital and tries to hide his face when he sees his wanted poster on the wall. When the police recognizes him, he runs. Then, Kwok comes into the hospital and was informed by his colleague that Ting brought Pau to the hospital and is running now. Kwok then receives a message from Ting and he calls him back which Ting tells him he needs to take good care of Pau and he has left money at his house while also stating they might not see each other again. In the hospital, Pau asks Kwok to help Ting leave Hong Kong safely. Ting goes to pick Peggy up but was confronted by Kwok in the parking lot where Kwok questions him how many has he killed. Kwok is determined to arrest Ting for killing people. Peggy then tells Kwok that Ting saved his father's life and risked himself as a wanted criminal to take his father to the hospital. Ting then tells Peggy to shut up stating that it is between him and his brother and is none of her business. Peggy states Kwok is not worthy enough to be Ting's brother since she understand him better than a brother of over 20 years. Ting holds his hands up and Kwok proceeds to cuff him but Peggy takes Kwok's gun and points at him saying this is Ting's last chance and asks him whether he really wants to arrest Ting and have him imprisoned for life. She also states their future is depending on him and begs him to let them go. Ting then takes the gun and tells Kwok that they were childhood friends who both dreamed of being cops. They both joined the police academy together but Ting was unsuccessful. He also tells him he does not want to be a wanted criminal and have no choice but to leave. Ting gives Kwok back his gun and finally agrees to let them go while also offering his motorbike to them since Ting's car is being tracked by the police. On the ship leaving Hong Kong, Ting and Peggy happily talk about their life in the future stating that there will be hardship, but they can start a new life. Peggy then jokingly warns Ting not try to court girls in Brazil since she heard that they are very nice. Ting says Brazilian girls are dark skinned and have body odor and would only love Peggy. Peggy then says she wishes their children in the future to join the Brazilian soccer team and play at the World Cup. Ting then asks Peggy how long have they known and Peggy clearly remembers it has been a month and six days. Ting also asks whether she will worry that he might leave her to which she replies she is the only girl in Brazil without body odor. As they are kissing, Fat Ko comes up and shoots Ting in the back and he falls into the water and the ship explodes which kills Peggy and several of Yeung's henchmen. Yeung watches this on the shore with his lawyer. At Yeung's estate, his lawyer tells him Ting will find out that Yeung was the mastermind behind this and he would testify against him. Yeung then decides to kill him but his lawyer tell him that it is impossible to do so since he is a wanted criminal and he is locked up tightly. Kwok visits Ting at the hospital and brings him a jar of soup. There, Ting asks Kwok about Uncle Pau's condition and tells him not to tell Pau that he is in prison since it would greatly upset him. Ting then gets angry and upset and Kwok tells him not to be upset and saying he would serve a lighter term if he cooperates with the police. However, Ting states that even so, he would still have to serve 30 to 50 years in prison and would be old when he comes out and would be useless. He is only in his twenties and he is afraid. Kwok then tells him that being in jail does not mean there is no more hope. Ting then says over the past ten years he has not done anything right and is a failure and says he will do something right this time by testifying against Yeung and helping Kwok recover his position. He tells Kwok that he will think it over in prison and is determined to become a good person again. Kwok leaves and steps in to his car but upon seeing Ting's watch, he comes back and gives it to the officers to safely store it for him. While showering, a prisoner tries to stab Ting but misses and stabs someone else. Another prisoner strangles Ting with a towel and Ting was stabbed. The injured prisoner crawls out calling for help and Kwok sees this and goes in the shower room with the other officers. Kwok sees Ting being tortured by two prisoners and hits one of them to the wall while other smashes his head with a piece of glass which knocks him unconscious. At the hospital, the doctor tells Pau that Kwok's left brain was devastated and dry blood are on his brain stem which causes his brain to be heavily injured. The doctors states that if he does not do surgery immediately, he would become aphasia, if worse, may become hemiplegic. Pau then asks the doctor the probability that the operation would be successful to which the doctor replies fifty percent. Afterwards, Pau visits Ting and seeing him all injured, he is sorry to his father. He tells Ting that since he was a child, he treated him very well as his own son and would only beat Kwok for misbehaving and when he wants to beat him, he would think of his father and give him a lot of freedom. Pau now realizes that this is a mistake and saying that he does have much time left but hopes to see the two brothers have a successful career and family. Seeing Kwok being heavily injured in the brain and Ting being beaten badly and in prison, Pau is greatly saddened and has a heart attack and is taken away by the nurse. Later, when Ting sees Yeung on the newspaper, he becomes furious and decides to escape from prison by holding a nurse hostage. After he successfully escapes, he goes to an opening ceremony of a Buddhist temple where Yeung funded to build. There, Ting takes out his gun and attempts to shoot Yeung but her daughter Lai-chu blocks him. However, Yeung pushes his daughter away and runs towards Ting was being tackled and cuffed by the police. At that time, Yeung was also informed that her daughter has a miscarriage which makes her greatly mad at her father. Ting and Yeung were brought to court and were charged for 28 cases of smuggling and 15 cases of instructing murder during 1974 to 1986. Since their crimes were major, they are not allowed for bail. However, Yeung's lawyer tell the judge that his client is a public figure in Hong Kong who must attend public meetings during the week and may not be locked up. The judge then allowed Yeung to be bailed on HK$3 million cash and must give out his travel passports. During the second court trial, Ting's lawyer convinced the judge that Ting lost his parents during childhood and never had a proper education while also being stressed by Yeung while Yeung's lawyer stated that his client is a rich tycoon with a net worth of HK$500 million and would not smuggle for only $3–4 million and the lack of evidence against him. In the end, the jury decided Ting to be guilty and Yeung not guilty. Ting was pleaded guilty by the judge and is sentenced to capital punishment since murder is a cruel crime and selling drugs does great harm to the community while Yeung is pleaded not guilty is released immediately. After the trial, Kwok, who is wearing a neck brace comes and gives a hug to Ting while he is actually giving Ting a chance to pull out his gun and shoot Yeung multiple times to death and the bailiffs were trying to stop him. After killing Yeung, Ting drops the gun and he and Kwok happily raise their hands up.

The barony, with eight knight's fiefs attached to it, was given to Hugh I of Charpigny.Miller (1921), pp. 71–72 The origin and name of the family is unclear, due to the differing attestations of his name in the main source, the various versions of the Chronicle of the Morea. The Greek version gives his surname as \\"de Lele\\", which has been commonly interpreted as being a corruption of \\"de Lille\\", and claims that he adopted the surname \\"de Charpigny\\" afterwards; while the Aragonese version of the Chronicle mentions that the first baron was Guy, that Hugh was his son, named \\"Cherpini\\" after the Greek village where he was born (which some authors identify with Kerpini), and \\"Lello\\" was the name of a fortress constructed on the family's domains in Laconia (possibly Helos); to further complicate matters, the toponym \\"Charpigny\\" is not attested in contemporary France.Bon (1969), pp. 108–110, 464 With the establishment of the Byzantine province of Mystras in the 1260s, and the subsequent wars that saw much of the Peloponnese overrun by the Byzantine Greeks, by ca. 1320 Vostitsa, along with Chalandritsa and Patras, were the only surviving out of the twelve original baronies to be still in Latin hands.Topping (1975), p. 118 The Charpignys held the barony until the early 14th century, when the direct male line became extinct (sometime before 1316). The Prince of Achaea, Louis of Burgundy, married the heiress of the barony to Dreux of Charny, who also received the barony of the de Nivelet family.Bon (1969), p. 464Topping (1975), p. 119 The family history of the Charpigny-Charny clan between 1316 and 1356 is obscure. Dreux's brother, Geoffrey, is attested, but he does not seem to have inherited any lands. However, in 1327 a lady Agnes, daughter of a certain Geoffrey de Charpigny (according to Karl Hopf, who thought he was a son of Hugh II), is mentioned as entering possession of her \\"maternal heritage\\", and it was Guillemette of Charny, the (alleged) daughter of Geoffrey de Charny, who succeeded the two baronies along with her husband, Philip of Jonvelle (married in 1344).Bon (1969), pp. 464–465, 701 Various suggestions have been made to simplify the family tree, such as Agnes being the unnamed wife of Dreux of Charny, with Guillemette as her sister.cf. Bon (1969), pp. 233–234 According to Raymond-Joseph Loenertz, these genealogical problems have been created by some lapsus in Du Cange's work Histoire de l’Empire de Constantinople sous les empereurs français, complicated by Hopf's habit to present his own (sometimes gratuitous or unfounded) hypotheses as facts. Agnes of Charpigny, daughter and heiress of Hugues II of Charpigny, would then have been the wife of Dreux of Charny, and the mother of his daughter Guillemette, Philipp of Jonvelle's wife.Loenertz (1975), pp. 458–460 In 1359, the rights to both baronies were purchased from Guillemette and Philip by Marie of Bourbon, who sold them on to Nerio I Acciaioli in 1363.Bon (1969), p. 701Topping (1975), pp. 119, 137–138 The barony was seized by the Navarrese Company ca. 1380, and held thereafter. By 1391 it was in the hands of Pedro de San Superano, who became Prince of Achaea in 1395.Bon (1969), p. 465Topping (1975), pp. 152, 155 Vostitza now became part of the princely domain, and on San Superano's death passed to the new princely line, the Zaccaria, until 1428, when it was lost to the Greek Despot of the Morea, Theodore II Palaiologos, who passed it on to his brother, Constantine.
