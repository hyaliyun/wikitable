Sola is a mixed media project, first unveiled through the prologue of the manga featured in the Japanese manga magazine Dengeki Daioh on December 21, 2006, published by MediaWorks. The manga, which is illustrated by Chako Abeno, ended serialization on February 21, 2008. The manga has been licensed for distribution in North America by Broccoli Books with the first volume being released in June 2008. A short drama CD which also served as a prologue to the series was released at Comiket 71 in December 2006, and a second drama CD was released in May 2008. An anime version aired in Japan between April and June 2007; the anime contained thirteen episodes, and two additional DVD- exclusive episodes followed. The anime was licensed by Bandai Entertainment for distribution in North America in a subtitle-only box set of all fifteen episodes. The title, Sola, is close in pronunciation to the Japanese word . At the end of 2007, Japanese anime fans voted Sola as the best anime of the year. Plot Sola's story revolves around Yorito Morimiya, the main protagonist, who is a young boy attending high school. He loves taking pictures of the sky at any time of day and any time of the year. One day, Yorito decides to take a picture of the sunrise overlooking the bay, but is deterred when he meets a strange girl trying to force a vending machine that stole her money to give her what she tried to buy‚Äîa can of tomato juice. Yorito helps her with forcing the machine while attempting to strike up conversation with her, despite it being four in the morning. Yorito tells her why he is here, but by the time he has forced the can out of the machine, the girl has mysteriously vanished. The next day, Yorito goes to visit his older sister Aono in the hospital with his friend Mana Ishizuki and Mana's little sister Koyori Ishizuki. Despite it being Aono's birthday, Yorito leaves soon after to take a photograph of the setting sun near an old church on the roof of the hospital. That night, Yorito leaves to buy groceries when it begins to rain and stops on the way home to wait for the rain to stop; while waiting, he runs into the strange girl he met from yesterday again. They talk longer this time and Yorito finally learns her name‚ÄîMatsuri Shihou. A few days later, Yorito goes looking for the girl in the old church and finds a man wielding a sword before Matsuri. After a display of Matsuri's astounding powers, Yorito discovers that she is in fact a creature known as a , who has lived for centuries. She is being chased by Takeshi Tsujidou who intends to kill her, but Yorito tries to protect her by bringing her back to his home which is when Yorito asks her to stay with him for the time being. A \\"Calamity of the Night\\", otherwise known as a , is a supernatural being in the Sola universe. Yaka have many supernatural powers, such as: strong physical ability, fast regeneration, and never aging body, among other powers. A Yaka is hurt by direct exposure to sunlight, but the wound can be healed in time if the exposure is not excessive; a Yaka is immortal unless exposed to too much sunlight or has received fatal wounds. Matsuri explains that a Yaka is the embodiment of human agony and pain and that such creatures are meant to always be alone. Despite this, the two fall in love. As their relationship deepens, Matsuri reveals her long tragic past and her knowledge of Yorito's past. Characters The main characters of Sola (from left to right): Koyori, Mana, Yorito, Matsuri, Aono, Mayuko, and Takeshi. ; : :Yorito is the main protagonist of Sola. He enjoys taking photographs of the sky and will go out of his way to do so. He meets Matsuri Shihou early on in the story and finds out she is not human and is being chased by a man‚ÄîTakeshi Tsujidou‚Äîwho intends to kill her. Yorito tries to protect her by asking her to stay at his house. Over the course of the story, he and Matsuri fall in love. Yorito has an older sister named Aono who at the beginning of the story is in the hospital. Yorito visits her with Mana everyday and he brings her a new doll from a strange store that sells oddly designed dolls. Yorito is in fact a paper construct made by Aono, implanted with the memories of and designed after the image of the original Yorito, who died in the past. Yorito is impaled on a sword wielded by Aono as she tries to stab Matsuri, and \\"dies\\"; disappearing in a pile of paper. ; : :Matsuri is a strange girl Yorito meets early on in the story. She is a , otherwise known as a Yaka, and has lived for hundreds of years. She cannot come in contact with direct sunlight as it harms her. Matsuri is fascinated by Yorito's photographs. Over the course of the story, she falls in love with Yorito. She has never seen a blue sky, only a deeply cloudy daytime sky or the nighttime sky. She has a particular fixed memory of seeing a moonlit sky from some sort of well or hole in the ground. Matsuri does not have much common sense and will often break machines in Yorito's house after kicking them too hard; she believes that any device can be fixed by kicking it. She has extreme fondness for tomato juice. Her ability is the power to make an object rapidly decay and transform those who have died into Yaka. Matsuri dies after stabbing herself with her sword, happy to finally see the beautiful azure sky she had always wanted to. ; : :Aono is Yorito's older sister who has been sickly ever since she was born and is hospitalized at the beginning of the story. She has a cold personality, showing very little emotion but still is visibly annoyed at Yorito for how much he seems to ignore her to do other things. Every time Yorito brings her a new doll, she takes one look at it and throws it in a nearby basket filled with other dolls. However, she does not hate them and even has one which is her favorite -- the first one Yorito brought her. She enjoys making origami and is friends with Koyori. Aono is a Yaka‚Äîshe was transformed into one by Matsuri when she tried to commit suicide after the Yorito from her time died in the avalanche that destroyed their house. Towards the end Matsuri kills herself so that Aono can become human again, freeing her from a world of darkness. ; : :Mana is Yorito's friend from school; she often gets annoyed at Yorito for how he spends so much time taking photographs of the sky instead of spending more time with his sister. It is implied that Mana is in love with Yorito which is also picked up by her friends but she denies this. Mana works as a waitress at the Azur Restaurant and often comes over to Yorito's house to cook for him. She looks after her younger sister Koyori. She also knows about Matsuri's secret, and is heart-broken when Yorito would not tell her what he really was when he found out. She eventually takes up Yorito's hobby of taking pictures of clouds in the early morning, although she has no more memories of him after his death. ; : :Koyori is Mana's little sister who, at the beginning of the story, is staying in the same hospital as Aono, but is soon discharged. Whenever she calls Mana by her given name instead of referring to her as her big sister, Mana strikes her head. Koyori tries to keep Aono company whenever she can and they become good friends over the time Koyori spends in the hospital. Aono also teaches her how to make origami. Koyori is very polite to others even when not required to do so. ; : :Takeshi is an older man who is trying to track down Matsuri. When fighting her, he wields a large sword unaffected by Yaka powers with the intention of killing Matsuri and uses ultraviolet rocket-flares to try to immobilize her. His intention to kill her is due to a promise to turn Mayuko back into a human. He was devoted to her when they were the same age: him as a young boy, and she was still alive. He promised to stay by her side until he can bring her back to normal. ; : :Mayuko is a young girl with distinctive attire who follows Takeshi; she is also a Yaka. Whenever Takeshi finds her, it is at night when she is sleeping in a cardboard box which changes location around the city. Mayuko has a pompous personality and will not hesitate to talk bad of Takeshi around others, but she worries about Takeshi a lot. She became a Yaka many years before the story began when she was killed during a house robbery. Takeshi has been her support and companion since her death. ; : :Sae is the most prominent of Mana's three friends and classmates. She works in the same restaurant as Mana and instantly was attracted to Takeshi when he first started coming to their restaurant due to his goatee. She also works at a convenience store. Sae loves to gossip and often talks to the point where she is ignored by her friends. She has wavy shoulder length hair and wears glasses. (The other two friends are Chisato, who has light brown hair and a fondness for Koyori, and Touko, who has long black hair.)

From 1966 to 1972, he was Federal Minister of Economic Affairs and from 1971 to 1972 Federal Minister of Finance. He was the inventor of the magic square, depicting Economic equilibrium, and of the Concerted activity (') to reflate the German market. He is thus seen as one of the most influential German economists beside Ludwig Erhard. Education and career Schiller was born in Breslau. From 1931, after passing the Abitur, he studied Economics and Law at Kiel, Frankfurt am Main, Berlin and Heidelberg. In 1935, he finished his studies and got his Doctorate in Politics. From 1935 to 1941, he researched at the Institut f√ºr Weltwirtschaft in Kiel.Gunnar Take: Forschen f√ºr den Wirtschaftskrieg. Das Kieler Institut f√ºr Weltwirtschaft im Nationalsozialismus, Berlin: de Gruyter, 2019, p. 225-236 In 1939, Schiller made his Habilitation. After taking part in World War II as a soldier from 1941 to 1945, Schiller became Professor at the University of Hamburg, where he became Principal from 1956 to 1958. In the meantime, from 1948 to 1966, he was a member of the scientific advisory board of the Federal Ministry for Economics. Political career Karl Schiller joined the paramilitary Stormtroopers (Sturmabteilung) of the NSDAP in 1933 and the party itself in 1937. After World War II he joined the SPD in 1946. From 1965 to 1972, he was a member of the Bundestag for the SPD, where he became assistant chairman of the SPD faction. From 1948 to 1953 Schiller was Senator for economy in Hamburg and held the same office again from 1961 to 1965 in Berlin serving under mayor Willy Brandt in his second term of office. From 1966 to 1972, he was Federal Minister of Economic Affairs in the grand coalition under Bundeskanzler Kurt Georg Kiesinger. He worked together with Franz Josef Strau√ü, then Federal Minister of Finance, in the Concerted activity. In this time, they were known as Plisch und Plum after figures invented by Wilhelm Busch. In the first cabinet of Willy Brandt, Schiller was Federal Minister of Finance from 1971 to 1972 after the demission of Alex M√∂ller. On 7 July 1972 Schiller demissioned, thus protesting against Brandt's economic decisions. After stepping down, he soon left the SPD as well. In 1972, he participated together with Ludwig Erhard in a CDU campaign, whereby both acted as defenders of market economy. In 1980 he returned to the SPD. He died in Hamburg. As Finance Minister Schiller travelled to the Soviet Union in 1970 and met with Alexei Kosygin, the Premier of the Soviet Union, to discuss a trade agreement between their two respective countries.

History Longjia International Airport was approved for construction in 1998. Construction started on 29 May 2003, and the airport began its operations on 27 August 2005. It is named after Longjia (), the town where it is located. It replaced the dual-use civil and military Changchun Dafangshen Airport, which reverted to sole military use. Commercial flights of Jilin Ertaizi Airport were also transferred to Longjia on 3 October 2005. According to original designs in 1998, the airport is estimated to serve only 2 million passengers, but the Municipal Government rejected this design, believing it would soon be insufficient for the city's needs, which later turned out to be a wise decision. However, due to this delay, the redesign of the airport did not start until July 2001. The airport was later expanded in 2009, the construction added two more gates with air bridges to the international section of the terminal, and enlarged the apron to the airport. The construction was finished in May, 2011. The airport is now able to accommodate long-distance wide-body jets such as the Boeing 747.

A part of the town once belonged to the comune of Gagliano del Capo.  Description  Santa Maria di Leuca is famous for its iconic lighthouse. With its height of 47 metres, and position at 102 metres above sea level, is the second most important lighthouse in Italy, after Genova. Next to the lighthouse is the large Sanctuary, or Basilica, De Finibus Terrae (\\"End of the Land\\", 1720-1755), built to commemorate the passage of St. Peter here during his travel to Italy. It is devoted to Saint Mary (from whom the town gets the name Santa Maria di Leuca). It lies on the former site of a Greek temple dedicated to Athena. The edifice has a fortified structure, and during its existence it sustained several assaults by Algerian pirates. In the same site, a Corinthian column was erected in 1939 to celebrate the construction of the Apulian Aqueduct (Acquedotto Pugliese). The basilica is connected to the port through a 284-step staircase. Panorama Punta Meliso promontory (the ancient Promontorium lapygium or Sallentinum) is the southeastern extremity of Italy ‚Äî traditionally considered the lowest point of the geographical \\"heel\\" of Italian peninsula, as well as the meeting point of the waters from the Adriatic Sea and the Ionian Sea. But Leuca is a bay so there's another promontory called Punta Ristola challenging this geographical particularity. According to Google Earth, Punta Ristola, at 39¬∞ 47‚Ä≤ 22.96‚Ä≥ N, is approximately 440 meters south of Punta Meliso, at 39¬∞ 47‚Ä≤ 37.73‚Ä≥ N. After World War II the town hosted Jewish Holocaust survivors for two years (1946-1948), giving them warm hospitality. Since October 2006 its territory is part of the Regional Park \\"Costa Otranto - Santa Maria di Leuca e Bosco di Tricase\\". Santa Maria di Leuca's littoral is marked by numerous grottoes with Latin and Greek inscriptions. Also famous are the 19th century patrician villas (c. 43 in number). Not far off Punta Ristola, at c. 85 m of depth, lies the shipwreck of the Italian submarine Pietro Micca, sunk during World War II with its crew of 58 men.  Legend  Prehistoric remains have been found in some the about 66 caves of the coast of Leuca, like Grotta Porcinara and Grotta del Diavolo. According to Luigi TasselliLuigi Tasselli, Antichit√† di Leuca (Lecce 1693, 1859). (17th century) the town takes its name from \\"Leucasia\\", a white beautiful mermaid ( from ancient Greek ŒªŒµœÖŒ∫œåœÇ = white, bright) who conquered sailors and farmers by her charming voice. In the year 1992 the Salento writer and poet Carlo StasiCarlo Stasi, Leucasia (racconti, leggende e poesie di terra, di mare e d'amore...) (AGL, Presicce 1993, 1996, 2001) and Carlo Stasi, Leuc√†sia e Le Due Sorelle (Storie e leggende del Salento), Mancarella Ed., Cavallino, 2008, 2012). created a story (mistakenly believed a legend) on the siren Leucasia imagining that he had fallen in love with a handsome messapian, the shepherd Mel√¨sso, who rejected her because he was in love with the beautiful Ar√¨stula. The siren took revenge by overwhelming the two lovers with the waves unleashed by her two tails and their bodies were petrified by the goddess Minerva in the two points that today are called Punta R√¨stola, from the name of Aristula, and Punta M√®liso, from Melisso. Lost her voice, Leucasia committed suicide and her petrified bones would be the white cliffs of Leuca. Santa Maria di Leuca was founded in fact in the early 1st century AD by some monks, after Saint Peter's passage. A cross was built in his honor and after some restructurings, still be there. According to a later legend, Virgin Mary once saved some boats from a storm, and her name was added to that of Leuca.

Census of schools There are 1,023 Census report of District in 1998 villages in district Dir lower. There are: *827 boys primary schools EMIS Data Dir Lower *405 girls primary schools *62 girls middle schools *90 boys middle schools *14 girls high schools (Badwan, Brangola, Chakdara, Hajiabad, Khadagzai, Talash, Timergara, ...) *52 boys high school *12 boys higher secondary schools (Brangola, Chakdara, Hajiabad, Talash, Timergara, ...) *3 girls secondary school *120 private schools. *2 Boys Colleges (Gulabad, Timergara) *2 Girls Colleges (Chakdara, Timergara) *1 University (University of Malakand at Chakdara, Established in 2001) Beside the government primary schools, Khwendo Kor NGO is running 15 schools, Elementary Education Foundation (EEF) is running 25 schools, ILO is running 7 schools and Non Formal Basic Education (NFBE) is running 95 schools. The numbers of madrassas (religious schools) are not yet available. Literacy rate The adult literacy of the district among the population aged 10 years and above is 93.9% which has increased significantly since 1981 when it was just 10.16 percent. The male literacy ratio is 95.76%> compared to 85.25% percent for females, according to census report 2018.Census District Dir in 1998 Quality measures The term quality Education needs clarity and no such practices are observed in the schools. The PTAs are formed in the schools according to government procedures, but these are only limited to school petty repairs and not involved in the school management. International development programmes In District Dir the schools and literacy department is supported by the World Food Programme for a girls enrollment enhancement programme. They provide the edible oil to the girls enrolled in the low enrollment school. There is need of developing more partnerships among these stakeholders so that the problems of education especially in the female education are solved. The NGO Khwendo Kor (KK) started a project on ‚ÄúPromotion of Girls Education in Dir‚Äù in this project KK strengthened and transformed the VECs (Village Education Committees) formed around the Community Based Girl Schools. The PRAs (Participatory Rural Appraisal) was carried out in 25 villages. Other activities running in District Dir are Women and Men Organization formation, the capacity building of the women organization and men organization was made in social activist, record keeping, PRAs, financial management etc. KK has now initiated a project on female education in Dir. This project is the combination of some activities, like the Development of District Education Planning, reactivating, strengthening and capacity building of PTAs, EFA forum activation and strengthening, educational budget tracking and Education Facilitation Center establishment, functionalization of the middle and primary schools. KK will facilitate the PTAs to register themselves as CCB with district government and get extra funds from the district development budget. This project will strengthen the public private partnership in education sector. KK has already signed the MoU with School and Literacy Department for undertaking these activities. CRC (SPARC) Child rights committee for Lower Dir district has also focused recently on the Education ratio in Lower Dir. CRC is a voluntary organization of SPARC working for the children rights in Lower Dir by means of lobbying and advocacy. CRC has now started a campaign against child marriage. Child marriage is also one of those harmful traditional practices which has been declared a criminal offence by the Child Marriage Restraint act 1929, yet they are being held with impunity throughout KPK, where the tradition has stronger roots than law. Problems According to the EMIS] of the School and literacy department, schools have different problems like drinking water supply, boundary walls, electricity and latrines. After devolution plan improvements are still awaited and the involvement of elected representatives in the monitoring and problem solving will take time. The role of CCBs in the education and schools is not explored and it can give better results if they are engaged in the education.

Moon also known as Hoon Sook Moon (born Hoon Sook Pak, January 1, 1963Birthday according to the Gregorian (solar) calendar rather than the lunar calendar often used in east Asia. Unification News, December 2001, Volume 20, No. 12) is the General Director of Universal Ballet in South Korea, and daughter-in-law of Sun Myung Moon, founder of the ballet company. She was the prima ballerina of the company. Biography =Early life= Julia Moon was born in 1963 in Washington, D.C., as Hoon Sook Pak. Her father, Bo Hi Pak, is a senior leader in the Unification Church and has been responsible for News World Communications (which published The Washington Times), CAUSA International, the Little Angels Children's Folk Ballet of Korea, and other church related organizations. At the age of ten, Julia Moon traveled to Korea to receive dance instruction with the Little Angels, which had been founded in 1962 by Sun Myung Moon. She performed as a singer and dancer with them. \\"At first, I was interested in gymnastics. Then I wanted to dance, but when I realized how much hard work it involved, I wanted to change. But my parents were very encouraging about me continuing with ballet,\\" she said. She took courses in ballet at the Sun Hwa Arts School in Seoul, and subsequently received instruction at the Royal Ballet School in London and L'Academie de Dance Classique de Princess Grace of Monaco. She was a dancer with the Ohio Ballet, and the Washington Ballet; joining the latter in 1982. =Universal Ballet= After her fianc√© Heung Jin Moon died in an automobile accident, Sun Myung Moon founded a dance company for her. She had been engaged to Sun Myung Moon's 17-year-old son, who died in 1984. She was previously known as Julia Pak, and was already a gifted ballet performer prior to the incident. \\"We had no definite date for a marriage but it was implicit that we would be together. Rev Moon had suggested us but we had made the decision,\\" she said of her fianc√©. In a ceremony, she was married to the spirit of Sun Myung Moon's son after his death, and became Moon's daughter-in-law. This was in accordance with Unification Church beliefs that only people who are married may enter into heaven. She had been performing overseas with the Washington Ballet, but was called back to the United States in order to be spiritually married to Heung Jin Nim. The marriage to her husband's spirit is believed to be \\"permanent and indissoluble\\". She explained to The Evening Standard about marrying a deceased groom, \\"In Korean tradition, I've heard there are other cases of this kind of marriage. In our church, my case is the only one where it's happened this way. But even if this personal situation had not happened, the company would still have got started.\\" Julia Moon commented to Dance Magazine on her relationship with her husband, \\"When I dance, I'm communicating with my husband. He's not here physically, but he's close in spirit.\\" She stated she \\"had a son with Jin\\" through adoption of her sister's son. \\"I have an adopted son, aged eight. My husband's younger brother's family wanted to offer me their child,\\" she said to The Evening Standard in 2000. The Universal Ballet company of South Korea was founded to serve as a memorial to her husband. Universal Ballet of Seoul, Korea was founded in 1984, and the Universal Ballet Foundation, Inc. was started by the Unification Church in 1986. Located in Washington, D.C., the Universal Ballet Foundation, Inc. operates as a casting office for the Universal Ballet of Korea. The dance company was initially started by Bo Hi Pak and ballerina Adrienne Dellas. Dellas had previously served as a dance instructor for Julia Moon. Julia Moon's father served as president of Universal Ballet as of 2000; he was also chairman of the Korean Cultural Foundation. At its inception, Julia Moon was the primal ballerina of Universal Ballet. In 1986, Julia Moon performed as the lead ballerina dancer at a performance based on a Korean folk tale called Shim Chung, in a production at the Asian Games, Culture and Arts Festival in Seoul. Shim Chung went on to become a popular performance piece in South Korea. In December 1989, Julia Moon made her debut with the Kirov Ballet in Leningrad in a performance of Giselle. To promote the performance, Sun Myung Moon took out a full-page advertisement in The New York Times. The ad featured an image of Sun Myung Moon. It also contained the text of an interview with Sun Myung Moon by a Soviet reporter, where Moon said the ballet was \\"an important moment in the development of my personal contact with the Soviet Union\\". Sun Myung Moon created the Kirov Academy of Ballet in Northeast for Julia, and recruited Oleg Vinogradov of the Kirov Ballet in Russia to serve as artistic director; Vinogradov was appointed to the role in 1998. In 1990, the founder of the Washington Ballet Mary Day commented to The New York Times about Julia Moon, \\"She's a lovely, lovely girl, and a lovely dancer and person. We were sorry to lose her when she went back to Korea to start the company.\\" As of 1990 the Universal Ballet company had yet to perform in the United States, but had hired guest performers from the U.S. at significant cost. In a 1993 interview with Tulsa World, Julia Moon said of the art of ballet, \\"It's really a universal language.\\" She spoke of Korean dancers versus other styles, \\"I think I would say that Korean dancers - those born and raised there - are very lyrical in their movements, more so than Japanese or Chinese or American dancers,\\" she said. \\"It's probably something related to Korean folk dancing, which uses a very soft line and is very lyrical.\\" In 1995, Julia Moon started her term as the general director of the Universal Ballet company. The Universal Ballet company's first tour in the United States was in 1998. Julia Moon said that the company is separate from Sun Myung Moon, and that only herself and one other member are also members of the Unification Church. Approximately half of the administrative staff, headed by her father, Bo Hi Pak, one of Rev. Moon's chief aides, belong to the Unification Church. She said the company does not perform modern ballet styles, due to her view that the \\"classical form is the most beautiful form and therefore that's where our background is\\". She commented that she would like for the company to move in the direction of more contemporary pieces, \\"We really do want to know more of these contemporary modern works. I think we're ready for it. We need to expand artistically in that area, as well as keeping parallel with the classical tradition.\\" In 2000, Julia Moon was interviewed by The Daily Telegraph on her thoughts about being the general director of Universal Ballet. \\"I lack certain qualities, as a dancer and as a director. Sometimes I do wish I was a nobody, but because this company was formed on me, I feel that if I faltered or wavered the company would falter as well,\\" she said. She commented in 2000 to The Evening Standard about homosexuality in ballet, \\"It exists in Korea, but since we started 16 years ago we haven't had any gay dancers. We just haven't had to deal with that issue.\\" In 2001, the Universal Ballet company performed Shim Chung in California. Julia Moon commented to The Press-Enterprise on the selection of Shim Chung as the performance piece, \\"We thought that this would be a good ballet to bring with us on this tour. We are very proud of it and we think that it is a very beautiful ballet. But beyond that I believe it demonstrates in the most convincing way possible that classical ballet and Korean literary and dance traditions can come together to create a new dance form, a blend in which each of the parts has its place.\\" She to The Press- Telegram in 2001 that at this point Universal Ballet was judged more for its artistic merit than its origins, \\"People are now judging us by our artistry. The press is less interested in the connection with the church. The church has no role in the ballet company. I am a member of the church, as is one other dancer.\\" In 2002, Julia Moon retired from her position as the star of the Universal Ballet company. In 2004, the Universal Ballet company performed La Bayad√®re at the Sejong Center for the Performing Arts in Korea. \\"The ballet is known for its spectacle. It's mammoth, visually grand and one of the more exotic ballets in the repertory,\\" explained Julia Moon. By 2004, she had become artistic director of Universal Ballet. In 2004, Bo Hi Pak was the chairman of the board of directors of the Universal Ballet company. According to the Long Beach Press-Telegram, \\"[Julia Moon's] role as general director had been at times overshadowed by the strong presence and energy of the Rev. Moon, and Pak, both of whom share a desire to create a world-class ballet company for Korea.\\" In 2008, the Unification Church still gave financial support to the Universal Ballet company, and Julia Moon had a position on the company's board of directors. In 2011, she received the Kyung-Ahm Prize.

He was declared successor to the Emperor Taizu in 916, but never succeeded to the throne. Rather, after the accession of his younger brother Yel√º Deguang (Emperor Taizong), he fled to the Shatuo Later Tang, where he was killed in 937.  Background  Yel√º Bei was born in 899, before the founding of the Khitan empire (which would later become known as Liao Dynasty). His father was the Yel√º clan chieftain Yel√º Abaoji, and his mother was Yel√º Abaoji's wife Shul√º Ping; he was their first son. He was described by the History of Liao as intelligent and studious in his youth, with a relaxed appearance and a loving heart. In 916, when Yel√º Abaoji declared himself emperor of a new Khitan empire as its Emperor Taizu,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 269. he created Yel√º Bei his crown prince. When Emperor Taizu inquired of his attendants which god he should first offer sacrifice to as part of his becoming emperor, his attendants largely advocated offering sacrifices to the Buddha. When Emperor Taizu pointed out that the Buddha was not a Chinese god, Yel√º Bei advocated offering first to Confucius. Emperor Taizu was pleased by the suggestion and built a temple for Confucius, having Yel√º Bei offer sacrifices to him twice a year. Yel√º Bei subsequently served as Emperor Taizu's forward commander in campaigns against the Wugu () and the Dangxiang tribes. Later, on incursions that Emperor Taizu made into the Chinese/Shatuo state Jin territory ‚Äî specifically, Jin's Lulong Circuit (ÁõßÈæç, headquartered in modern Beijing) ‚Äî he left Yel√º Bei in charge at his capital Linhuang Municipality (Ëá®ÊΩ¢, in modern Chifeng, Inner Mongolia). It was during this time that Yel√º Bei was said to have drafted a plan to conquer Khitan's eastern neighbor Balhae.  As King of Dongdan  In 926, Emperor Taizu decided to carry out the plans to conquer Balhae. In a campaign, he captured the important Balhae city Fuyu (Â§´È§ò, in modern Siping, Jilin).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 275. (This appeared to have ended the Balhae state, even though Emperor Taizu did not at this time capture Balhae's capital Longquan.)Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 68 [926]. Emperor Taizu set up a Dongdan Kingdom over the old Balhae territory, with its capital at Fuyu, and made Yel√º Bei its king, with the title of \\"Imperial King of Man\\" (‰∫∫ÁöáÁéã, Ren Huangwang), echoing the titles used by himself (\\"Imperial Emperor of Heaven,\\" Â§©ÁöáÂ∏ù, Tian Huangdi) and his wife (Yel√º Bei's mother) Empress Shul√º (\\"Imperial Empress of Earth,\\" Âú∞ÁöáÂêé, Di Huanghou). He gave his second son (Yel√º Bei's younger brother) Yel√º Deguang the title of \\"Generalissimo Crown Prince\\" and made Yel√º Deguang in charge of Linhuang, replacing Yel√º Bei. Shortly after conquering Fuyu, however, Emperor Taizu fell ill and died while still at Fuyu. Empress Shul√º took over effective leadership of the Khitan, and she and Yel√º Bei began the trek of escorting Emperor Taizu's casket back to Linhuang, leaving one of Emperor Taizu's younger brother Yel√º Anduan () temporarily in charge at Dongdan. Once then returned to Linhuang, she wanted to divert the succession away from Yel√º Bei, as she had favored Yel√º Deguang. However, formally, she called an assembly of the chieftains, along with Yel√º Bei and Yel√º Deguang, and stated to them, \\"I love both of my sons, and I do not know which one to make emperor. You can decide which one you wish to support by holding his rein.\\" The chieftains, knowing that she favored Yel√º Deguang, rushed to him and held to his rein. She thereafter declared him emperor (as Emperor Taizong). Yel√º Bei, angry over this turn of events, took several hundred soldiers and wanted to flee to Later Tang (Jin's successor state), but was intercepted by Khitan border guards. Empress Shul√º (now empress dowager) did not punish him, but sent him to Dongdan.The History of Liao gave an account where it was Yel√º Bei who voluntarily yielded the throne to Emperor Taizong, but that would appear to be inconsistent with his subsequent actions. See History of Liao, vol. 72. Emperor Taizong, after becoming emperor, became suspicious as to whether his older brother intended to take back the throne, and therefore moved Dongdan's capital to Dongping (Êù±Âπ≥, in modern Liaoyang, Liaoning) and forcibly moved the former Balhae people to Dongping. He also put guards in place to monitor Yel√º Bei's actions. When Emperor Mingzong of Later Tang heard this, he sent secret emissaries encouraging Yel√º Bei to flee to Later Tang. Yel√º Bei, commenting, \\"I yielded the empire to the Emperor, but now I am under suspicion. It is better that I go to another state so that I can be like Wu Taibo.\\" He thus took his favorite concubine Lady Gao and his extensive book collection, got into a ship, and sailed to Later Tang. In 930, he arrived at Later Tang's Deng Prefecture (ÁôªÂ∑û, in modern Yantai, Shandong).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 277. (Yel√º Bei's wife Imperial Queen Xiao and his oldest son Yel√º Ruan did not follow him to Later Tang, and Imperial Queen Xiao would subsequently continue to rule the Dongdan state until her death in 940, while Yel√º Ruan would eventually succeed Emperor Taizong after his death (as Emperor Shizong).)History of Liao, vol. 3.History of Liao, vol. 4.  As Later Tang subject  È®éÂ∞ÑÂúñ \\"Archer and Horse\\" attributed to Yel√º Bei, National Palace Museum = During Emperor Mingzong's reign = In 931, Emperor Mingzong made Yel√º Bei the military governor (Jiedushi) of a newly created Huaihua Circuit (Êá∑Âåñ, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei), and gave him a new name of Dongdan Muhua. Later in the year, he changed the Dongdan Muhua name further to Li Zanhua, and that would be the name used by the Khitan prince for the rest of his life. However, there was no sign that Li Zanhua ever reported to Huaihua, and in 932, Emperor Mingzong instead stated an intention to give him a command south of the Yellow River. When the Later Tang officials opposed, Emperor Mingzong stated, \\"His father and I agreed to be blood brothers, and that is why Zanhua came to me. I am now old. How would he have even come to a later emperor now matter how hard they enticed him?\\" He thereafter made Li Zanhua the military governor of Yicheng Circuit (Áæ©Êàê, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan), but selected a talented staff to take effective governance of the circuit, allowing Li Zanhua not to carry out actual responsibilities. He also gave a concubine of his predecessor Emperor Zhuangzong's, Lady Xia, to Li Zanhua to be his new wife, and he also was lenient toward Li Zanhua such that even when Li Zanhua committed offenses, he would not punish Li Zanhua. However, it was said that Li Zanhua was cruel toward his concubines and servants ‚Äî as he liked to drink blood, his concubines often had to injure themselves so that they would bleed for him to drink, and the servants would often suffer severe punishments, including having their eyes gouged out, being cut by swords, or being burnt by fire, for minor faults. Lady Xia eventually could not endure seeing this and, after requesting permission from Emperor Mingzong, divorced Li Zanhua and became a Buddhist nun. Despite his cruelty, however, Li Zanhua was also said to be highly talented. He understood fortunetelling and music, and was very talented in medicine. He could write in both the Khitan and Han languages, and translated the Huangdi Yinfujing into Khitan. He was particularly well known for his paintings of Khitan people and things, and many of his paintings eventually ended up in the palace collections of the Song Dynasty decades later. In 933, he was recalled from Yicheng and given the completely honorary title of military governor of Zhaoxin Circuit (Êò≠‰ø°, headquartered in modern Ganzhou, Jiangxi) (as Zhaoxin's territory was then ruled by Wu).History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 44. Despite his having fled to Later Tang territory and becoming a Later Tang subject, Li Zanhua continued to maintain communications with his mother and brother, often sending emissaries to them. The communication went the other way around, too, as when his grandmother Grand Empress Dowager Yaonian died in 933, his mother and brother notified him of her death. = After Emperor Mingzong's reign = Also in 933, Emperor Mingzong died, and was initially succeeded by his biological son Li Conghou the Prince of Song (as Emperor Min).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 278. In 934, Emperor Mingzong's adoptive son Li Congke the Prince of Lu overthrew Emperor Min in a rebellion and became emperor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 279. Li Zanhua was said to have secretly communicated to his brother Emperor Taizong the opinion that this was a good opportunity to invade Later Tang, although Emperor Taizong took no actions at that time. Throughout the years, apparently because of Li Zanhus'a presence in Later Tang and the fact that Later Tang had captured a number of important Khitan commanders, Empress Dowager Shul√º had repeatedly sought heqin alliances between Khitan and Later Tang. In early 936, Li Congke, apprehensive over the prospect that his brother-in-law Shi Jingtang the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi) might rebel and enlist Khitan aid in doing so, had his officials Li Song and L√º Qi () draft a plan under which such an alliance would occur ‚Äî but then abandoned the plan. Later in the year, Shi Jingtang did rebel, and Later Tang forces was initially successful in advancing to Hedong's capital Taiyuan Municipality and putting it under siege. However, they were thereafter crushed by aid troops that Emperor Taizong himself commanded and trapped by Khitan forces at Jin'an Base (ÊôâÂÆâÂØ®, near Taiyuan). When Li Congke sought advice from his officials, Long Min () suggested that he create Li Zanhua the Emperor of Khitan and send an army to escort him back to Khitan territory, to create a second front that Khitan's Emperor Taizong would have to deal with. Li Congke gave initial approval to the plan, but the more powerful officials opposed, believing the plan to be useless, and nothing eventually came of it. Eventually, Emperor Taizong created Shi the emperor of a new Later Jin (as its Emperor Gaozu), and Shi subsequently headed south, with Khitan aid, toward the Later Tang capital Luoyang. With Later Tang generals defecting to Later Jin in droves, Li Congke gathered his family and generals loyal to him to the palace, intending to commit suicide by burning down the palace. When he summoned Li Zanhua, however, Li Zanhua refused to join the mass suicide, so Li Congke sent the officer Li Yanshen () to kill Li Zanhua. After the new Later Jin emperor entered Luoyang, he mourned Li Zanhua, posthumously created Li Zanhua the Prince of Yan, and had his body delivered back to Khitan.

The Angora rabbit's hair and pelt is known for strength and durability, and it was also \\"associated with luxurious evening wear, [and] would be an elegant solution for keeping SS officers and the German military warm and able to endure rough wartime conditions\\". Angora rabbits were raised in Nazi concentration camps, including Auschwitz, Buchenwald, Dachau, and Trawniki. A bound volume entitled Angora that belonged to Heinrich Himmler, chief of the Nazi SS, was discovered in a farmhouse with his other papers near the end of World War II. It tells the story of the Angora rabbit project that operated in the Nazi death camps. Chicago Tribune war correspondent Sigrid Schultz found the book in its hiding place near Himmler's alpine villa, and described the significance of the Angora project: > In the same compound where 800 human beings would be packed into barracks > that were barely adequate for 200, the rabbits lived in luxury in their own > elegant hutches. In Buchenwald, where tens of thousands of human beings > starved to death, rabbits enjoyed beautifully prepared meals. The SS men who > whipped, tortured, and killed prisoners saw to it that the rabbits enjoyed > loving care. The rabbits were raised for their soft, warm fur, which was shaved and used for, among other things, the linings of jackets for Luftwaffe pilots. Himmler, in a 1943 speech (referring to the prisoners that endured forced labor), stated: \\"We Germans, who are the only people in the world who have a decent attitude towards animals[,] will assume a decent attitude toward these human animals; but it is a crime against our blood to worry about these people.\\" Few accounts of the Angora project have survived, though American soldiers at one camp reported that when prisoners were asked to slaughter the rabbits at the end of the war to make stew, they couldn't bear to do it. Today, Himmler's Angora book is housed at the Wisconsin Historical Society. Photographs, charts and maps from the book are among the more than 27,000 images available in the Wisconsin Historical Society's digital collections. Angora was featured in a Wisconsin Historical Images online gallery in March 2007.

He is noted for a series of instrumental albums featuring the mandolin, live performances with his partner Hilary James and his groups The Mandolinquents and Slim Panatella & the Mellow Virginians, and (with Hilary James) for writing and performing for children. He has produced a series of instructional books and DVDs for the mandolin, and is also a regular columnist for Acoustic magazine, along with Martin Taylor, Doyle Dykes, Gordon Giltrap, Maartin Allcock and Julie Ellison.  Career  Mayor (at right, on guitar) with Phil Fentimen and Hilary James as \\"Spredthick\\" at the 1980 Towersey Festival Mayor cites fiddler and mandolinist Dave Swarbrick as a teenage musical influence, after being taught to sing in Tonic sol-fa by his father when very young. With his solo debut The Mandolin Album in 1990 he embarked on a series of recordings with the stated aim of giving the mandolin a uniquely British voice. The CD was made Recording of the Week on BBC Radio 2. His mix of original and traditional material alongside classical pieces has been noted by BBC World Service (Recording of the Week), Q, Cosmopolitan, Living Tradition (Scotland) and Sing Out! (USA). In May 2000 he entered the UK's Classical Artist Top Ten with Mandolin Moods, a 'best of' release of his own compositions and classical works on Universal Records. His touring schedule has included the Rudolstadt International Folk Festival, Shetland Folk Festival, Vancouver Folk Festival, The Stephen Leacock Humour Festival (Canada), Cheltenham Literature Festival (England), Edinburgh Fringe (Scotland), The Classical Mandolin Society of America and others. He leads Britain's first modern mandolin quartet, the Mandolinquents. The quartet emerged from a 1997 line up, The Mandolin All-stars with multi- instrumentalists Maartin Allcock and Chris Leslie of Fairport Convention, and longtime musical partner, Hilary James. The Mandolinquents now includes the classical guitarist Gerald Garcia, multi-instrumentalist Richard Collins and Hilary James on mandobass and vocals. He played swing fiddle on the album for the show Five Guys Named Moe, and plays fiddle with his occasional trio Slim Panatella & the Mellow Virginians. Simon Mayor and Hilary James have also written satirical and topical songs for BBC news programmes including Newsnight. An admirer of fellow Yorkshireman the late Jake Thackray, Mayor occasionally performs a special programme of Thackray's songs.  Youth audience  Simon Mayor tours regularly with long-time partner Hilary James. The duo have worked extensively with young people in theatres and schools, and have written over fifty children's songs, many for their own Musical Mystery Tour children's CDs and the Musical Mystery Tour songbook published by Faber Music. Their work had featured widely on the BBC. For six years they were regular hosts of BBC School Radio's The Song Tree. They also wrote for, and on occasion presented, BBC's Play School, The Listening Corner and Play Days. In addition, Mayor worked as multi-instrumental session musician for other BBC radio programmes Singing Together, Music Workshop and Time and Tune. Their songs have been used extensively in education, including English language teaching courses for Danish schoolchildren. In 2011, Top That! Publishing published I'm A Parrot and Gobble! Gobble! Gobble!, two children's illustrated rhyming story books using the lyrics from two Mayor/James songs and with drawings by Hilary James.

The EU agencies and other bodies are located all across the union, but usually not fixed in the treaties. The Hague is the only exception, as the fixed seat of the European Police Office (Europol). Over the years, Brussels has become the principal seat, with each major institution and now the European Council being based wholly or in part there, leading to it being popularly known as \\"the capital of the EU\\". The seats have been a matter of political dispute since the states first failed to reach an agreement at the establishment of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1952. However, a final agreement between member states was reached in 1992, and later attached to the Treaty of Amsterdam. Despite this, the seat of the European Parliament remains controversial. The work of Parliament is divided between Brussels, Luxembourg City and Strasbourg, which is seen as a problem due to the large number of MEPs, staff, and documents which need to be moved. As the locations of the major seats have been enshrined in the treaties of the European Union, Parliament has no right to decide its own seat, unlike other national parliaments. Locating new bodies is also not without political disputes. The European Central Bank's (ECB) seat had to symbolise its independence from political control, and was located in a city which did not already host a national government or European institution. New agencies are also being based in eastern Europe since 2004 to balance the distribution of agencies across the EU. Locations The treaties of the European Union outline the locations of the following institutions: The European Parliament has its seat in Strasbourg, hosting twelve monthly plenary sessions (including budget session). Brussels hosts additional sessions and committees (including being used in September 2008 for normal sittings when the Strasbourg chamber was damaged). Luxembourg City hosts the Secretariat of the European Parliament. The Council of the European Union has its seat in Brussels, except during April, June, and October, when meetings are held in Luxembourg City. The European Commission also has its seat in Brussels, although some departments are hosted by Luxembourg City. The European Court of Justice, the General Court, and the Court of Auditors are based in Luxembourg City along with the European Investment Bank. The Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions are entirely based in Brussels while the European Central Bank is based in Frankfurt and Europol is the only agency to have its seat fixed by the treaties, in The Hague. Separately, the Treaty of Nice establishes Brussels as the venue for all formal summits of the European Council after 2004. However some extraordinary sessions are sometimes held outside the city. The European Council's seat is however fixed by a declaration rather than a protocol, meaning it is less binding than the other seats. The 2011 Treaty Establishing the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) states that the seat of the ESM must be in Luxembourg. The ESM should be ratified and active in mid-2013 and it is allowed to establish a liaison office in Brussels.Treaty Establishing the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) , Council of the European Union =Non-fixed seats= There are numerous other bodies and agencies that have not had their seats fixed by treaties. Brussels hosts the European Defence Agency (as NATO and formerly the WEU are also in the city). Luxembourg City hosts the Translation Centre for the Bodies of the European Union and the European Investment Bank. Strasbourg and Brussels both host the offices of the European Ombudsman. The other agencies are spread across Europe and since the 2004 enlargement, there has been a drive to locate more agencies in the new member-states to make a more equal distribution. However, some problems have been encountered with basing agencies in the eastern states. For example, Frontex, the new border agency, has had problems recruiting skilled experts because many do not want to live in the agency's host city, Warsaw, due to its relatively low wages and standard of living. In addition, plans to place the headquarters of Galileo in Prague met with opposition over security concerns that the city would not be safe enough for such a sensitive agency. =Commission departments= Although the Commission is mainly based in Brussels, some of its departments are required to be based in Luxembourg City since the 1965 agreement which listed the following for Luxembourg City; ECSC financial departments, the DG for Credit and Investments, the department which collects the ECSC levy and attached accounts departments; the Publications Office with related sales and proofreading services and CORDIS; the EEC Statistical Office and data-processing department; the EEC and ECSC departments for hygiene and industrial safety; DG for Health; DG for Euratom safeguards and any appropriate administrative and technical infrastructure for these. As departments have changed over the years, some are no longer present as they have been abolished or merged, with most departments present being mainly based in Brussels while retaining a minor presence in Luxembourg City. There are however some departments which are still entirely based in the city per the 1965 agreement. =\\"Capital\\"= The treaties or declarations of the EU have not declared any city as the \\"capital\\" of the EU in any form. However, informally the term has found usage despite connotations out of step with the normal perceptions surrounding an inter/supranational entity. Brussels is frequently the subject of the label, particularly in publications by local authorities, the Commission and press. Indeed, Brussels interprets the 1992 agreement on seats (details below) as declaring Brussels as the capital. Likewise, authorities in Strasbourg and organisations based there refer to Strasbourg as the \\"capital\\" of Europe (often wider Europe due to the presence of the Council of Europe there as well) and Brussels, Strasbourg and Luxembourg City are also referred to as the joint capitals of Europe, for example in relation to the \\"Eurocap-rail\\" project: a railway that would link \\"the three European capitals\\". History At the founding of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in 1951, the states could not agree which city should host the institutions of the new community. Brussels was widely preferred, but was vetoed by Belgium which insisted on Li√®ge. Because of the impasse, Luxembourg City was chosen as a provisional choice for all but the Assembly (Parliament), which was to be based in Strasbourg. Two further communities were created in 1957 and again a provisional agreement laid out that the Assembly would meet in Strasbourg, the Courts would meet in Luxembourg City, and the Commissions and Councils would be split between Luxembourg City and Brussels. These institutions later started to be concentrated in the latter city. As various agreements were reached, activities in Luxembourg City gradually shifted to Brussels and the Parliament, although bound to remain in Strasbourg, also started to work in Brussels while the courts remained in Luxembourg City. The final agreement in 1992 set up the present arrangement, including the division of the Parliament's work between the three cities. In 2002, the European Council, having previously rotated between different cities, decided to base itself in Brussels. =Beginning= The former headquarters of the High Authority in Luxembourg City The ECSC was founded by the Treaty of Paris in 1951; however, there was no decision on where to base the institutions of the new community. The treaties allowed for the seat(s) to be decided by common accord of governments, and at a conference of the ECSC members on 23 July 1952 no permanent seat was decided. The seat was contested, with Li√®ge, Luxembourg, Strasbourg and Turin all considered. While Saarbr√ºcken had a status as a \\"European city\\" (Europeanised presence and control), the ongoing dispute over Saarland made it a problematic choice. Brussels would have been accepted at the time, but divisions within the then-unstable Belgian government ruled that option out. To break the deadlock, Joseph Bech, then Prime Minister of Luxembourg, proposed that Luxembourg City be made the provisional seat of the institutions (including the Council and High Authority) until a permanent agreement was reached. In 1958, after the Treaty of Rome came into effect the new members of the community had to again decide on a seat. In early 1958 they could not come to a conclusion, and various cities began to lobby for the position. It was decided that in principle all of the institutions should be located in one city as soon as feasible. Brussels, Strasbourg, Luxembourg, Turin, Milan, Stresa, Paris, Nice, and the French Department of Oise were all considered by the \\"European Committee of Town-Planning Experts\\" in a report to the Council of Ministers. However, even after the presentation of the report the countries could not agree, and in June 1959 a three-year moratorium on the decision was set. The delay helped Brussels establish itself as the seat, since it was already functioning as much of the administration was already working there in offices space loaned from the Belgian government. During this time Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, and the European institutions themselves favoured Brussels; Luxembourg City wanted to maintain the seat of the ECSC (or be generously compensated); France supported Strasbourg, and Italy continued to promote Milan.de Groot, 191 However, it was decided that the Common Assembly, which became the Parliament, should instead be based in Strasbourg‚Äîthe Council of Europe (CoE) was already based there, in the House of Europe. The chamber of the CoE's Parliamentary Assembly could also serve the Common Assembly, and they did so until 1999, when a new complex of buildings was built across the river from the Palace. =Provisional agreement= The creation in 1957 of the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC or Euratom) created new duplicate institutions to the ECSC (except for the Parliamentary Assembly and Court of Justice, which were shared). On 7 January 1958, it was decided that Brussels, Luxembourg City, and Strasbourg would again be provisional venues until a final decision. Strasbourg would retain the Assembly, Luxembourg City the Court and both Brussels and Luxembourg City would host meetings of the Councils and Commissions (or High Authority). The discretion of the exact meeting place of the new Councils was given to the President of the Council. In practice, this was to be in the Ch√¢teau of Val-Duchesse until the autumn of 1958, at which point it would move to 2 Rue Ravensteinstraat in Brussels. Meanwhile, the ECSC Council was still based in Luxembourg City, holding its meetings in the Cercle Municipal on Place d‚ÄôArmes. Its secretariat moved within the city on numerous occasions, but between 1955 and 1967, it was housed in the Verlorenkost district. On 21 June 1958, the Parliamentary Assembly recommended to the Council that the Assembly should have its seat in the same place where the other organisations are based, although it accepted that plenary sessions could be held elsewhere. The Assembly also nominated three cities to be the seat of the institutions (Brussels, Strasbourg and Milan), however no permanent agreement was reached. The provisional arrangement was reiterated on 8 April 1965 with the \\"Decision on the provisional location of certain institutions and departments of the Communities\\". This was following the Merger Treaty, which combined the executives of the three Communities into a single institutional structure. However, with the merged executives, the Commission and most departments were grouped together in Brussels, rather than Luxembourg City. The Commission was first based on Avenue de la Joyeuse Entr√©e/Blijde Inkomstlaan, before moving to the Breydel building on the Schuman roundabout, and then its present location in the Berlaymont building. The ECSC secretariat moved from Luxembourg City to the merged body Council secretariat in the Ravenstein building of Brussels. In 1971 the Council and its secretariat moved into the Charlemagne building, next to the Commission's Berlaymont. These premises rapidly proved insufficient and the administrative branch of the secretariat moved to a building at 76 Rue Joseph II/Jozef II-straat. During the 1980s the language divisions moved out into the Nerviens, Fr√®re Orban and Guimard buildings. To compensate Luxembourg City for the loss of the Commission and Council, a number of provisions were laid out. Firstly, the Court of Justice would remain in the city. Some departments of the Commission and the Assembly, including the Secretariat of the Assembly would remain along with European Investment Bank (further, particularly financial, institutions would also be prioritised for Luxembourg City). The Council would also have to hold sessions in Luxembourg City during April, June and October. It also confirmed Strasbourg as the seat of the Parliament. With the prioritisation of Luxembourg City for future institutions, in 1977 the Court of Auditors became provisionally located in Luxembourg City. =Edinburgh agreement= Parliament built a hemicycle in Brussels to be closer to the other institutions Despite the 1965 agreement, the Parliament's seat remained a source of contention. Wishing to be closer to the activities in Brussels and Luxembourg City, a few plenary sessions were held by the Parliament between 1967 and 1981 in Luxembourg City instead of Strasbourg‚Äîagainst the wishes of France‚Äîand in 1981 it returned to holding sessions entirely in Strasbourg. In the previous year it unsuccessfully issued an ultimatum to the national governments, attempting to force them to reach an agreement. Thus, the Parliament moved some of its decision-making bodies to Brussels, along with its committee and political group meetings, and in 1985 it also built a plenary chamber in Brussels for some part-sessions. All the Parliament's attempts in this field were challenged by member states. In response, the European Council adopted on 12 December 1992 in Edinburgh a final agreement on the seats. The Decision on the location of the seats of the institutions and of certain bodies and departments of the European Communities outlined that the Parliament would be based in Strasbourg, where it would be obliged to hold \\"twelve periods of monthly plenary sessions, including the budget session\\". However, additional sessions could be held in Brussels, which is where committees also should have met while the secretariat had to remain in Luxembourg City. It also provided for the Court of First Instance (now known as the General Court) to be based in Luxembourg City with the Court of Justice, which remained there. However, this agreement dropped the provision from the 1965 decision, which gave priority to Luxembourg City for any new judicial and financial bodies. In response, Luxembourg attached a unilateral declaration stating it did not renounce this article. However they did renounce any claim to the seat of the judicial Boards of Appeal of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market via the Treaty of Nice. The Parliament challenged this decision splitting their working arrangements, declaring that the division of its activities between three states was against the treaties and the natural prerogatives of a Parliament elected by direct universal suffrage, claiming the right to decide its own workings to its own efficiency. In response, leaders annexed the decision to the Treaty of Amsterdam, including it in the treaties. =Central bank= In 1993 it was decided that the central bank (shown) was to be seated in Frankfurt. A Council decision on 29 October 1993 on the location of European agencies established that the European Monetary Institute, later the European Central Bank, would be based in Frankfurt. Frankfurt had to compete with numerous other cities, including London, Paris, Amsterdam, Luxembourg, Lyon, Barcelona and even Basel (in Switzerland, which is outside the European Union). France even linked the issue of the seat to the ongoing dispute regarding the seat of the European Parliament. Frankfurt was criticised as symbolising German dominance, although the Deutsche Bundesbank had effectively been running the Communities currencies for the previous years, while Luxembourg City has a banking tradition that wasn't so careful. London was discredited because the UK remained outside the eurozone. It was also seen as important to locate the bank in a city not already hosting a national government or EU institution, in order to emphasise its independence. Others, such as the former head of the Bundesbank Karl Otto P√∂hl, favoured a small country with a stable currency. The advantages of hosting the Bank were also in dispute by some economists. While there was seen by some as little to gain in terms of attracting other banks and financial institutions, others saw it as affecting which cities would be financial hubs in the years to come. =Recent history= In 1995, the Council of the European Union moved into the Justus Lipsius building in Brussels. However, with its staff increasing it continued to rent the Fr√®re Orban building to house the Finnish and Swedish language divisions; later it started to rent further buildings in Brussels. In 2002, the European Council also began using the Justus Lipsius building as their Brussels venue, following an advanced implementation of a decision by European leaders during ratification of the Nice Treaty to do so at such a time as the total membership of the European Union surpassed 18 member states. Prior to this, the venue for European Council summits was in the member state that held the rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union. In order to make room for additional meeting space a number of renovations were made, including the conversion of an underground carpark into additional press briefing rooms. However, in 2004 leaders decided the logistical problems created by the outdated facilities warranted the construction of a new purpose built seat able to cope with the nearly 6,000 meetings, working groups, and summits per year. This resulted in the Europa building, which opened its doors in 2017, and is now home to both the Council of the European Union and the European Council. Both institutions continue to use the adjacent Justus Lipsius building, linked by two skyways to the new construction, for low-level meetings and for use by the Council secretariat. In 2004, following renovations to remove asbestos, the European Commission moved back into its headquarters in the Berlaymont building and the Barroso Commission concentrated its activities there, with the President and meeting room on the thirteenth floor. As of 2007, the Commission occupies 865,000m¬≤ in 61 buildings across the Brussels EU district, with staff increases owing to the enlargement of the EU prompting speculation of possible new building plans. The European Parliament seat remained an issue throughout this period, despite the Council writing it into the treaties. During the 1990s, the issue was debated every year and in 1999, 250 MEPs signed a letter condemning the arrangement and the Strasbourg facilities. The following year Parliament voted 401 to 77 for a resolution demanding the right to decide its own working locations. Attempts to include this in the following treaties in 2000 and 2007 both failed. However, in September 2008 Parliament held its first full plenary session in Brussels after the ceiling of the Strasbourg chamber collapsed during recess forcing the temporary move. The unique architecture of the European Commission's Berlaymont building is utilised in its official emblem. Likewise, the official emblem of the European Council and Council of the European Union features the Europa building's distinctive multi-storey \\"lantern\\" shaped structure where meetings for both of these institutions take place. European Parliament The Parliament is bound to spend \\"twelve periods of monthly plenary sessions, including the budget session\\" in Strasbourg, while additional sessions and committees are in Brussels. The secretariat is in Luxembourg City. While the split arrangements for other bodies have relatively little impact, the large number of members of the Parliament and its concentration of work load means that these issues are far more contentious than those surrounding the other institutions. A democratic question has also been raised in the European Parliament being one of the few parliaments in the world which cannot decide its own meeting place, and also being the only parliament to have more than one seat. Parliament's trips between Brussels and Strasbourg (image) have been criticised on grounds of democracy, cost, environmental impact, and practicality. Critics have described the three-city arrangement as a \\"travelling circus\\" with a cost an extra 200 million euro over a single location. Defenders of the Strasbourg seat, like the MEP for Germany Bernd Posselt, however claim that the figure is rather a mere 40 million euro, i.e. an extra cost of 8 cents per EU citizen. When Parliament was forced to meet in Brussels in September 2008, due to a fault in the Strasbourg building, it was estimated that Parliament saved between ‚Ç¨3 and 4 million, though the exact figure is hard to calculate. As the Commission also meets in Strasbourg when Parliament is out of Brussels, the cost of Commissioners moving amounted to ‚Ç¨9.5 million between 2002 and 2007. The Green party has also noted the environmental cost in a study led by Jean Lambert, MEP and Caroline Lucas, MEP; in addition to the extra financial cost, there are over 20,268 tonnes of additional carbon dioxide, undermining any environmental stance of the institution and the Union. Jens-Peter Bonde, former leader of the ID group, stated in 2007 that unless the issue of the seat was tackled, it would be impossible to increase the election's turnout, as the movement of the seat was the issue raised by voters most often. He, along with Green co-leader Monica Frassoni, called for a debate on the issue, which was being blocked by President Hans-Gert P√∂ttering. The trips between the cities are seen by the public as \\"a money-wasting junket hugely enjoyed by journalists, MEPs and researchers\\" when in fact it is \\"a money-wasting junket loathed by journalists, MEPs and researchers\\" according to Gary Titley, MEP (PES), who announced he would not be standing for re-election in 2009 because of the two-seat issue. Titley stated that he could \\"no longer tolerate the shifting of the Parliament lock, stock and barrel to Strasbourg one week a month...It's a miserable journey and it's always a problem\\", noting the problems in lost luggage. As well as undermining the EU's climate change objectives, he criticises the Strasbourg sessions as the deals have already been made leading to them becoming formal voting sessions padded out with \\"debates saying we are against sin.\\" Titley also states that, because the journeys take so much time, the committees in Brussels who do the bulk of the work do not have sufficient time to work. Titley is not the only one to leave over the issue; Eluned Morgan MEP is standing down in 2009 for similar reasons, notably due to the toll the moving has on time with her family, and former MEP Simon Murphy quit as leader of the Socialists in 2002 due to the inconvenience of the arrangement. =Brussels as a single workplace= The parliamentary hemicycle of the Paul-Henri Spaak building in Brussels Brussels is already the seat of the two other political institutions, the Commission and Council of Ministers (including the European Council). In addition, the Parliament has already geared three quarters of its activity in the city. Third-party organisations are also based in the city, including NGOs, trade unions, employers' organisations and the highest concentration of journalists in the world‚Äîalso due to the presence of NATO in the city in addition to the large presence of Union institutions. While Strasbourg campaigners see being based in Strasbourg as an aid to independence of MEPs, Brussels' campaigners state it is merely reducing the institution's influence by \\"exiling\\" them away from the other major institutions. Brussels also has better transport links than Strasbourg, with lower pay for civil servants which reduce costs. Some commentators further underline that night-life in Strasbourg is comparatively lacklustre and that MEPs who'd wish to relax after a long and hard working day aren't offered many opportunities to do so. The position of Strasbourg suffered a minor blow in 2006, when allegations surfaced over charges by the city of Strasbourg on buildings the Parliament was renting. The controversy died down when the European Parliament decided to officially buy the buildings on 24 October 2006. In May 2006, an online petition, oneseat.eu, was started by MEP Cecilia Malmstr√∂m calling for a single seat of Parliament, to be based in Brussels. By September of that year it reached its aim of one million signatures, and according to a provision in the European Constitution a petition signed by a million citizens should be considered by the Commission. The overall validity of the petition was called into doubt, however, due to it being on the Internet and using e-mail addresses instead of street addresses. In addition, the majority of signatories were concentrated in northern Europe, notably the Netherlands (40%). Regardless, the petition is seen by pro- Brussels groups as an important symbol. One signatory to the petition was Commission Vice President Margot Wallstr√∂m; she supported the campaign, stating that \\"something that was once a very positive symbol of the EU reuniting France and Germany has now become a negative symbol‚Äîof wasting money, bureaucracy and the insanity of the Brussels institutions\\". In early 2011, the Parliament voted to scrap one of the Strasbourg sessions by holding two within a single week. and the Dutch government joined the calls to scrap the seat altogether. The mayor of Strasbourg officially reacted by stating \\"we will counter-attack by upturning the adversary's strength to our own profit, as a judoka would do\\" and announced that his town would press forward for a complete relocation of all parliamentary related services of the EU to Strasbourg. In August 2012, cracks were found in the beams supporting the ceiling of the Brussels hemicycle, leading to a closure of at least 6 months of the entire A section of the Paul Henri Spaak Building according to an estimate released on 9 October 2012 by the Parliament administration. In early December 2012, it became known that the damage was more serious than previously thought, and that the closure of the hemicycle was expected to last \\"until November 2013\\". All \\"mini plenary\\" meetings in Brussels until this date were cancelled. Since, as of December 2012, the European Parliament is \\"having trouble\\" finding a company to carry out the repair work, it is likely that the reopening of the Brussels hemicycle may take place only in 2014. =Strasbourg as a single workplace= Some campaigners wish to see the concentration of the Parliament's activities back in Strasbourg (one being a campaign called the \\"Association for European Democracy\\" launched on 15 March 2007). This is seen to be symbolic of decentralisation of the EU away from Brussels. Emma Nicholson, the only British MEP to support Strasbourg, argues that being next door to the Council of Europe allows MEPs to keep in touch with delegates from the rest of Europe, such as Russia, and that being in Brussels isolates the EU from such influences. Pro-Strasbourg campaigners also argue that Strasbourg offers more independence for Parliament, away from the other institutions and lobby groups in Brussels. If the Parliament was wholly in Strasbourg, then the news media would also no longer be able to use shortcuts such as \\"Brussels decided...\\" rather than discuss the detail of the decision markers. Media would also have to be based in Strasbourg and hence might provide better coverage of the Council of Europe. Strasbourg is also preferred for historical reasons, having changed hands between France and Germany four times between 1870 and 1945. It is also argued that Brussels is no longer a good symbol for European unity given the recent political disputes in Belgium. This position was supported by President Josep Borrell Fontelles, although he earned some criticism when he stated that the importance of Strasbourg in the context of the Second World War could not be perceived in the same way as France and Germany by \\"Nordic countries\\" (a reference to the Swedish MEP who started the one-seat petition). French MEP Brigitte Foure started a pro-Strasbourg petition, one-city.eu, in 2008 (countering the Brussels petition) which has gained just over 7,190 signatures as of October 2012. Following the announcement (on 21 October 2010) of the setting up of an \\"informal seat study group\\" by British MEP Edward McMillan-Scott (Liberal Democrats), which was seen as an attack on Strasbourg by the municipality, Roland Ries and Catherine Trautmann released (on 29 October 2010) an energetic joint declaration of defense.Press Release by R. Ries and C. Trautmann , 29 October 2010 On 9 November 2010, the municipal council of Strasbourg green-lighted a project (envisioned since April of the same year) of the creation of a \\"Place for Europe\\" (lieu d‚Ä≤Europe) ‚Äì a walk-in centre for people curious about the European institutions in Strasbourg ‚Äì in the former Villa Kaysersguet, an architecturally precious but currently (2010) derelict 18th-century mansion neighbouring with the European Court of Human Rights and the Agora building of the Council of Europe.Un \\" lieu d'Europe \\" √† la localisation contest√©e, Les Derni√®res Nouvelles d'Alsace, 10 November 2010 =Opinion and actions= A poll of MEP in June 2007 by MEP Alexander Nuno Alvaro, a pro-Brussels campaigner, found that 89% wanted a single seat and that 81% preferred Brussels. However, despite polling all MEPs, only 39% responded to the questions. Alvaro stated that, after consulting polling firms, this was a high turnout for an opinion poll even if not totally representative. A Parliamentary magazine was pressured to drop the publication of this poll initially, reflecting the sensitive nature of the issue. In the same month, another survey by Simon Hix of the University of Manchester and Roger Scully from the University of Aberystwyth found a 68% support for a single seat. In their survey 272 of the 732 people questioned responded. Following each sitting in Strasbourg, hundreds of MEPs sign a petition calling for a reduction of time in Strasbourg, though Pascal Mangin, Strasboug's deputy mayor, does not believe the opinion of the MEPs to be important. Nevertheless, in January 2009 a Parliamentary written declaration calling for one Brussels seat failed to get sufficient support. It gained 286 signatures out of 393 needed for it to be considered. Brussels campaigners cited that it was bad timing, with French and German leaders of Parliament and the main two groups ordering their members not to support the motion. The campaigners vowed to continue the fight while the Mayor of Strasbourg Roland Ries this time welcomed the \\"wisdom of the parliamentarians\\" and said it signalled their desire for Strasbourg to host the institution alone. A survey of citizens' attitudes conducted in May 2006 included two questions on the issue of the Parliament's seat. On average, 32% people from all member states supported the two-location policy while 68 were against. Support for one location was higher among men than women, and among people over 35 than under. Support for both locations was one percentage point lower in the 10 countries which joined in 2004 than in the 15 earlier members; No group have more than 40 percent support to two locations. Of those against two seats, 76% supported Brussels and 24% supported Strasbourg. In this case support for Brussels was 6 percentage points higher in the 10 new members with women and the under 35 year-olds. The group with the highest support for Strasbourg was the over 35-year-olds with 28 percent support. The citizens of Strasbourg are of course strong supporters of the Parliament being based in Strasbourg with each session being worth four million euro to the city's economy. In September 2008, Strasbourg's government passed a motion demanding all of Parliament's activities be relocated to the city. These polls have not affected the position of France, which can veto any such move, with French President Nicolas Sarkozy stating that its seat is \\"non-negotiable\\". Despite that, the government has stated that the issue might be addressed if France were to be offered something of equal value. The Council itself has indicated privately that it would discuss the Strasbourg seat only if Parliament gives them a signal to start a debate, as they would not do on their own initiative. However, few wish to discuss the issue while the current constitutional issues are still present. Although political parties have no formal position, the Greens, Liberals and Socialists are all outspoken on having Brussels as a permanent seat. In 2020, Irish MEP Clare Daly told The Parliament Magazine that the coronavirus pandemic highlighted the unnecessary nature of travelling to Strasbourg for plenary, and called for the seat's abolition as part of the EU's economic recovery plans =Alternative role for Strasbourg= In January 2003, Green-EFA co-leader Daniel Cohn-Bendit proposed turning the Strasbourg seat into a \\"European university\\". Elaborating on this in 2008, he sees such a university teaching all subjects and funded directly by the EU with between 15,000 and 20,000 students. The same idea has been put forward in January 2006 by Polish minister and former dissident Bronis≈Çaw Geremek, in an article originally published by Le Monde. In an open letter to Cohn-Bendit, Roland Ries, the mayor of Strasbourg, reminded him that the international attractiveness of the University of Strasbourg was related to the presence of European Institutions in Strasbourg and that it would not be enhanced, but undermined, by the replacement of one of the largest of these institutions by just another, and much smaller, university. The year before, the proposed European Institute of Technology had been touted as the university to take over the building. It has been proposed that the Institute could also be merged with European Research Council and based there. The vice-chancellors of Strasbourg's three universities have suggested merging to create a 'European University'. It has also been suggested that Strasbourg could host the European Council meetings, minor institutions such as the Committee of the Regions, or the institutions of the proposed Mediterranean Union. The Green Party has proposed having Strasbourg as the home of a new \\"European Senate\\". Following the United Kingdom's decision to leave the EU, it has been suggested by senior MEPs that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and European Banking Authority (EBA), currently based in London, could relocate to France in exchange for the scrapping of the Strasbourg seat. The EMA would utilise the parliament's former complex of buildings. Other plans mooted, following the election of French President Macron, include converting it into a parliament for use by the Eurozone.

Based on the book What Are Your Angels Now? by Pelham Groom (who was also technical advisor to the film under his full title of W/Cdr. A. J. C. Pelham Groom), the plot centres on a young fighter pilot immediately before and during the Battle of Britain in the Second World War. Some scenes in the film were shot at RAF Uxbridge, home to a wartime operations room. \\"Angels One Five\\" refers to RAF radio procedure words, from the Second World War, indicating the altitude of a radar contact is 15,000 feet. The film was the first British post-war production to deal with the Battle of Britain.Pendo 1985, p. 175. Plot In 1940, a replacement, Pilot Officer T. B. \\"Septic\\" Baird (John Gregson), is landing his Hawker Hurricane at \\"Pimpernel\\" Squadron's airfield. Just as he touches down, however, a straggler from an earlier mission taxis across his path. Septic's quick reactions allow him to \\"leapfrog\\" the other Hurricane, averting a costly disaster. His action, however, causes him to crash his replacement aircraft into the bungalow of Squadron Leader Barry Clinton (Cyril Raymond) at the end of the runway. This earns Septic the wrath of his new squadron leader, Bill Ponsford (Andrew Osborn), because he damaged his fighter aircraft. The crash also injures the ligaments in Septic's neck, which he is able to self- diagnose, as he had been a medical student before the war. The next morning, Septic is told by Group Captain \\"Tiger\\" Small (Jack Hawkins) that he will not be able to fly until his neck is healed, so he will instead serve in the operations room for the time being. Several days later, with the risk of a bombing attack on the airfield, and all of Pimpernel Squadron's Hurricanes scrambled, Tiger orders all aircraft to take off and fly out of harm's way until the raid is over. With Tiger quickly assembling all available pilots and finding aircraft to fly, Septic wins a foot race with Small to claim the last spare Hurricane for himself. He then proceeds to shoot down a Messerschmitt Bf 110 from the attacking force. His delight is short lived however when he is admonished by Small and Sqn Ldr Peter Moon (Michael Denison) for leaving his radio set to transmit, preventing the returning Hurricanes from being diverted to an undamaged airfield. A crestfallen Septic returns to his ground duties. Eventually a reinstated Septic joins in Pimpernel's operations, but he is mortally wounded while shooting down another enemy aircraft. His last words are heard over the Sector control room tannoy (public-address system), when he tells Small that their planned return foot race will have to be \\"postponed indefinitely\\". Small replies \\"Your message received and understood. Out.\\" The final shot is of Squadron Leader Clinton's wife Nadine (Dulcie Gray) hanging an oil lamp in the ruins of their bungalow to aid returning pilots.

It is often said to be the center of Dhaka, dividing \\"Old Dhaka\\" and \\"New Dhaka\\". Paltan was made a thana in 2005 by then Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia. Paltan Thana was formed on 27 June 2005 comprising part of Motijheel thana. History Photo taken 1875 by an unknown photographer, shows a small mosque beside a tree on the Puraria Paltan Maidan The name Paltan came from a cantonment of the British East India Company. The name was derived from the English word platoon, but in reality a size of battalion or regiment. Starting from Gulistan area, Purana Paltan, Purana Paltan Lane, Naya Paltan, Topkhana and up to Fulbaria rail-line, it was the cantonment of the East India Company and there were Artillery forces in Topkhana. 'Top' means cannon and Topkhana means armoury. It is a Turkish word. In the year 1840 the cantonment was transferred to Ramna, Begunbari, then to Lalbagh Fort. After the First war of Indian Independence (sepoy mutiny according to the British Raj) in 1857 the Cantonment was shifted to Mill Barrack. After the transfer of the cantonment the area was given to the municipality to be taken care of. From the whole area they took a part and made a garden which was known as ‚ÄùCompany Bagicha‚Äù.

Before the 1950s this area presently named as Nayapaltan was called Ramkrisnapur. There were hardly 25 families residing in the two lanes of the area. One lane is through to Purana Paltan. The other lane was blind having less than 10 families. In 1952 (Year of Bhasha Andolon) the residents (Including Dr. Abdul Halim, Md. Rajab Ali, Md. Zohad Hossain, and others) of the area (Then Ramkrisnapur) sat together in several occasions to change the name of the area. The reason was, after partition of 1947 all the original owners of the area sold their houses and migrated to India and new owners populated and developed the area. The first proposal was to change the name from Ramkrisnapur to Allahrasulpur. In subsequent meetings this proposal did not get sufficient support. The second proposal was Nayapaltan. Immediately, this proposal was seconded and supported by all. The most respected person of the blind lane was Professor Dr. Abdul Halim. Originally the lane was six ft wide. One fine morning in the year of 1953/54 Dr. Halim sat together with the local land lords and took a resolution to widen the lane from 6 ft to 18 ft. In the next day he grounded all his five giant trees along his property line and released 6 ft of his side. Then all other land lords followed him. That is how the lane of Naya Paltan came into existence. At that time 18 ft. wide lane was simply a dream. Notable of the old residents after the partition of India at that period were Councillor of the then Municipality Alhajj Abdul Halim Chowdhury, Mr. Hasan Ali Sheth, Mr. K.B.M.A Rashid, Engineer Zahurul Haque, Engineer Abdul Karim, Dr. Joynal Abedin, M.A. Shikdar, Mr. M.A. Samad, NurunNabi Gazi, Moulvi Idris Chowdhury, Mr. Arab Ali, Mr. Ansar Ali, Mr. Helal uddin, Mr. Fazlul Haque, Mr. Khandakar Mohiuddin, Mr. Syed Abdul Majid, Mr. Shamsher Ali Khan, Mr. Muzaffar Hussain, Mr. Abdul Wase Chowdhury, Mr. Haris ur Rahman Chowdhury, Mr. Gazi Harun ur Rashid, Mr. Munshi Shakhawat and few more. Purana Paltan Under British rule, the Government maintained a regiment of soldiers here and hence the name, Purana Paltan. In this spot the Army had a firing range. During 1956 there were fewer buildings in Purana Paltan and it was surrounded by villages on the east and north, and a vast empty space to the south. Now there's hardly any open place. This is an old Dhaka Landmark. At present it is famous for publishing houses.

Development In 1981 Gold Wings Aviation, a private company under Capt. Panfilo Villaruel Jr. (who later became chief of the Air Transportation Office (ATO) and president of the Philippine Aerospace Development Corporation (PADC)), conceived an aircraft research and development undertaking called the Norlindo program, named after one of its first engineers. The program covered a progressive development of a high-performance trainer primarily intended for use by the Philippine Air Force (PAF). The program was launched as an innovative step to build an aircraft of local design and utilizing indigenous materials. Gold Wings initiated preliminary design of a twin-engine turboprop named Norlindo and even began conceptual design of a turbojet trainer called Tinihaban Superstrike under the All-Filipino Technology Aircraft (AFTA) project. Out of these experiences, a single, piston engine trainer aircraft was conceived, designed, built and flown within three years. The Defiant 300 prototype, as the aircraft was called, flew twice, the first on February 22, 1988. The Defiant project came out to be an excellent collaborative effort of a group of aeronautical engineers, aviation enthusiasts, government agencies and research institutions. Based on the successful flights of the prototype, Gold Wings planned to build another prototype of a modified Defiant (appropriately named Defiant 500) with an all-metal airframe and power rating increased to 500 hp. Due to lack of financial support from the government, the plan did not push through, including another design of a light aircraft called Pegasus, which was presented to the Philippine Army as a contender for the proposed Philippine Army aviation arm. Design The two-seat tandem Defiant prototype (registered as RP-X239) was an exceptional technical arrangement of various systems and parts taken from different types of aircraft in the PAF inventory. The landing gears, flight controls and flaps motor were taken from the Beechcraft T-34 Mentor, seats from the Cessna U-17B, rudder and brake pedals from the Boeing-Stearman PT-13 and various instrument items from the Britten-Norman BN-2 Islander, T-34 Mentor, Sikorsky S-76 and SIAI-Marchetti SF.260. The Defiant was powered by a single Lycoming IO-540-K1B5 piston engine on loan from the PADC, the same engine that powers the BN-2 Islander. The prototype had the highest engine power rating of all the prototypes of local design flown so far. Noteworthy were several original features designed and fabricated by the engines with technical support from several persons and companies. The airframe was fabricated from palosapis wood and the skin from tanguile veneer plywood. The engine mount was fabricated from chrome molybdenum steel. Most significant of all was the fabrication and assembly of a one-piece plastic canopy. Fuel tanks were constructed with 5052-H34 aluminum alloys. Instrument panel, electrical, hydraulic and pitot-static systems were laid out with the help of reference books and articles.

(2010, July 16). Penicillin: the Oxford story. Retrieved from http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/science-blog/penicillin-oxford-story# By the end of the month, the scratch was badly infected with both Staphylococcus and Streptococcus and Constable Alexander was hospitalised in the Radcliffe Infirmary. Despite efforts of various treatments, Alexander's head was covered with abscesses and one of his eyes had been removed. Ethel Florey, wife of pharmacologist and medic Dr Howard Walter Florey, and Dr Charles Fletcher brought Constable Alexander's case to Florey's attention. The ability of penicillin to slow or counteract bacterial infection had first been noticed by Sir Alexander Fleming in 1928. Florey, Ernst Boris Chain and Norman Heatley, at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford were working on the medical applications of penicillin, as produced by the mould Penicillium notatum, and attempting to isolate quantities of penicillin from the mould large enough for a human trial. Having tried the extracted penicillin only on mice, Florey and colleagues were fearful of the side effects large doses of penicillin might have. For a human volunteer, they needed a patient who was in a terminal condition; Constable Alexander suited this requirement. On 12 February 1941, Constable Alexander was given an intravenous infusion of 160 mg (200 units) of penicillin. Within 24 hours, Alexander's temperature had dropped, his appetite had returned and the infection had begun to heal. However, due to the instability of penicillin and the war-time restrictions placed on Florey's laboratory, only a small quantity of penicillin had been extracted and, although Florey and colleagues extracted any remaining penicillin from Alexander's urine, by the fifth day they had run out. Constable Alexander relapsed, and died on 15 March 1941. Florey and his team decided to work only on sick children who did not need such large amounts of penicillin, until their methods of production improved. This was not a trivial challenge: penicillin production varied widely depending on the conditions in which it was grown. During World War II, several American companies tried to scale up production. In the words of Pfizer executive John Smith, ‚ÄúThe mold is as temperamental as an opera singer, the yields are low, the isolation murder, the purification invites disaster.‚Äù Nonetheless, by March 15, 1945, supplies of penicillin were not only available to American troops, but to the American public, as war-time restrictions on availability were lifted.

It was a success when it was inaugurated in Elberfeld in 1853 and was adopted by many other German cities, but by the turn of the century an increasing population became more than the Elberfeld system (which relied on volunteer social workers) could handle, and it fell out of use. Background The first attempts to create a reformed poor relief system in Elberfeld began in 1800, when, dissatisfied with existing conditions, the city appointed six visitors to investigate applications for relief. The visitors were increased to 12 the following year. In 1802 there was a great increase. The city was divided into eight districts and these districts into four sections, and a board of supervisors chosen. At the time (the first half of the 19th century), the textile-manufacturing cities of Barmen and Elberfeld were pioneering the industrialization of Germany. Immigration swelled the population of Elberfeld from 16,000 to 19,000 in 1810 to 31,000 to 40,000 in 1840, and the two cities were among the most densely populated municipalities in Germany. The 1802 system was further extended in 1841. In 1850, dissatisfaction having arisen in several quarters, the Lutheran church attempted to do the work. Matters were not improved. The population of poor people was disproportionately high. And the centrally managed system of urban poor relief that the two cities had inherited proved to be too expensive and inefficient to cope with the new scale of the problem. The Elberfeld system was a new structure of care that attempted to adapt to the new conditions. The system In 1852, a plan proposed by a banker, Daniel von Heydt, was put in operation. The administration of poor relief was decentralized. Working under a citywide poor office, subdepartments were established in smaller precincts - their relief workers worked on behalf of the central office. There were 252 precincts, each to care for four to 10 families. Each precinct was in the care of an unsalaried almoner whose duty was to investigate each applicant for aid and to make visits every two weeks as long as aid was given. (Although, aid was not always extended - initial assistance was limited to two weeks and further services had to be approved again.) Fourteen precincts formed a district. The almoners met every two weeks under direction of an unpaid overseer to discuss the cases and to vote on needed relief. Those proceedings were reported to the directors, being the mayor as ex officio chairman, four councilmen, and four citizens (also unpaid), who met the day following to review and supervise the work throughout the city. In emergency cases the almoner might furnish assistance. Relief was granted in money according to a fixed schedule for two weeks at a time, any earning the family may have garnered being deducted. Tools were furnished when advisable. The funds distributed to the poor came either from city coffers or from existing charitable foundations. Key to the system was that the almoners and overseers served voluntarily. They came mostly from the middle class, being minor officials, craftsmen or merchants. Women were also accepted as almoners, giving them a rare (for the time) opportunity to participate in public life. The larger number of volunteers decreased both the number of clients per almoner, and the total system costs. The system gave great satisfaction; the expenses in proportion to the population gradually decreased, and the condition of the poor is said to have improved. The essential principles of the Elberfeld system found application in the public-relief administration of the cities of the Rhineland, notably in Cologne, Crefeld, D√ºsseldorf, Aix-la- Chapelle, and Remscheid. A similar system had been employed in Hamburg. The Elberfeld system influenced the reorganization of relief systems in most of the German cities. Attempts to introduce the system in non-German cities were unsuccessful. In the last third of the 19th century, however, immigration fuelled by industrialization once again increased the numbers of the needy, and the poor relief volunteers reached the limits of their capabilities. In the larger cities particularly, there was a return to greater centralization and professionalisation of poor relief. In 1903, sculptor Wilhelm Neumann- Torborg (who was born in Elberfeld) created a bronze sculpture, The \\"Elberfeld Poor Relief Monument,\\" to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Elberfeld system. The statue was mostly destroyed during the Second World War, when the bronze figures were melted down for metal. But in 2003, the granite pedestal of the monument was rediscovered during excavations at the Elberfeld Old Reformed Church, and placed on display in Blankstrasse, Wuppertal. In 2011, it was restored thanks to 24 private donations. The bronze figures were recast at the Kayser Art Foundry by sculptor Shwan Kamal in D√ºsseldorf.

At the time of his testimony he had four children and was working on behalf of the United Auto Workers (UAW) to unionize workers at a division of Firestone Tire and Rubber in Illinois. The UAW underwrote his legal expenses.New York Times: \\"Court Ends his Dilemma,\\" June 18, 1957, accessed June 16, 2012 Watkins was asked to name people he knew to be members of the Communist Party. Watkins told the subcommittee that he did not wish to answer such questions and that they were outside the scope of the subjects on which he was summoned to testify and of the committee's jurisdiction. He said:FindLaw: John Watkins v. United States 354 U.S. 178 (1957) His conviction carried a fine of $1000 and a one-year suspended prison sentence.

Decision The Supreme Court decided 6‚Äì1 to overturn Watkins' conviction. Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote for the majority. Warren noted that it is an offense for a witness to refuse to answer any question \\"pertinent to the question under inquiry\\" in testifying before a Congressional committee, but he wrote that the Court was unable to ascertain the nature of the Congressional inquiry with reasonable precision: The New York Times commented: \\"The Supreme Court has placed fundamental restrictions on a Congressional investigatory power that in recent years has been asserted as all but limitless.\\"New York Times: \\"Inquiry Reform Seen Inevitable,\\" June 19, 1957, accessed June 16, 2012 Senators James Eastland and William E. Jenner, who played principal roles in investigating left-wing activities, issued a statement accusing the Court of contributing to \\"the trend of the past year of undermining our existent barriers against Communist subversion.\\" The decision's impact was limited in that the Court limited the application of the principles it espoused in Watkins.Arthur J.

He was a pioneer of sound- on-film technology and made significant improvements to the amplification capacity of the vacuum valve. Having seen a showing of the Lumi√®re brothers' new motion picture technology as a 9-year-old boy in Helsinki in 1896, he was inspired to bring sound to silent pictures. Many years later, in 1914, his demonstration film Word and Picture was presented to a gathering of scientific dignitaries in Berlin, but his invention was never commercialized. In addition to improving the triode vacuum valve, he developed directional loudspeakers. Tigerstedt also predicted such future inventions as television and he invented the mobile phone, for which he in 1917 successfully filed a patent. The patent was granted to Tigerstedt for what he described as a \\"pocket-size folding telephone with a very thin carbon microphone\\". Tigerstedt was awarded a total of 71 patents in several countries between the years 1912 and 1924.  Life  =Early interest in technology= Tigerstedt was born in Helsinki and started to show a particular interest in all things technical at an early age. He studied his father‚Äôs scientific books with great interest, and at age 11 he built a simple photographic device. At age 13, he began experimenting with other technical devices and machines, and he built his own version of an electric motor and electrical batteries. After a falling out with his father, he left home at the age of 15, supporting himself by working as a handyman and technician in mechanical workshops and shipyards in Helsinki. He later worked as a technician in the telephone industry, which was rapidly becoming a major business in Helsinki at that time. =Studies in Germany= In 1908, Tigerstedt moved to Germany to continue his studies. He completed his high school education and began studies in electrical engineering at the Friedrichs Polytechnikum in K√∂then. After completing his studies there in 1911, he moved back to Finland with his fianc√©e Marjatta Nybom, whom he had met and fallen in love with while in K√∂then. She had been studying the violin in Switzerland and met Tigersted through her brother Albert Nybom, who was also studying in K√∂then and was a classmate of Tigerstedt. However, the engagement between Tigerstedt and Marjatta Nybom was broken off in 1912. =Sound-on-film prototype= After returning to Finland, he continued his experiments and succeeded in building a prototype of sound-on-film technology (\\"talking movies\\"). Tigerstedt then returned to Germany in 1913 and founded a company with the Swedish merchant Axel Wahlstedt and the Swedish engineer Hugo Swartling. This was the first in a series of unsuccessful business ventures. Although Tigerstedt was able to complete his work with the sound-on-film technology, the partners' laboratory was eventually confiscated due to unpaid rent. They managed to reclaim their laboratory, but it was then destroyed in a fire. The cooperation between Wahlstedt and Tigerstedt became strained and in January 1914 they dissolved their company. After breaking off their commercial partnership, Wahlstedt returned to Sweden, while Tigerstedt stayed behind in Berlin, more or less broke. =Demonstration of sound-on-film= Tigerstedt continued working on his sound-on-film technology and made progress in solving a major technical problem, that of how to amplify film audio sufficiently to fill a large theatre or hall. He did this by making major improvements to the vacuum tube design of Lee de Forest, increasing the amplification capacity substantially. In February‚ÄìMarch 1914, Tigerstedt demonstrated his sound-on- film technology to a small group of scientists, using his own film Word and Picture. =1914-1917= After being expelled from Germany in July 1914, Tigerstedt returned to Finland, but he moved to Sweden a few months later and then to Denmark in 1915. After another unsuccessful business venture, Tigerstedt once more returned to Finland. In 1917, he moved back to Denmark and founded yet another company, which was then sold. After that, he participated in the founding of the Norwegian company A/S Anod, in which he held a 45% stake. =Finnish Civil War of 1918= As a Finnish citizen, Tigerstedt was called back to take part in the Finnish civil war of 1918, and on 14 February 1918 he was on his way back to Finland. After the cessation of hostilities, he participated in the victory parade on 16 May 1918, but then returned to Denmark, where he married Ingrid Lignell in 1919. Their son Carl Axel Waldemar was born in 1921. However, their marriage soon began to deteriorate, and they separated not long after the birth of their son. =Loss of German patents= During World War I, Germany invalidated all of Tigerstedt's patents. After the war, he received compensation from the German government, but the sum quickly became worthless due to the hyperinflation in Germany during 1921 to 1923. In 1922, Tigerstedt moved his laboratory to Finland and founded a new company called ‚ÄúTigerstedts patenter‚Äù, which however also failed. =Move to America= In 1923, Tigerstedt moved to America where he founded his last company, the Tiger Manufacturing Co., to produce small radio receivers and cryptographic devices. The Mexican government purchased two of the cryptographic devices, and the radio receivers also sold relatively well. Tigerstedt had the opportunity to meet with the great American inventor Thomas Alva Edison, who wrote a letter of recommendation for Tigerstedt to the director of the Department of Commerce. = Death = When it finally seemed that Tigerstedt was on the verge of commercial success, he was involved in an ultimately fatal car accident on April 20, 1924, when another car unexpectedly turned in front of the car Tigerstedt was travelling in. There were persistent rumours that a competitor had arranged for the accident, but there was never any proof of this. Exactly one year later, on April 20, 1925, he succumbed to tuberculosis at the New York Fifth Avenue Hospital, possibly due to side effects from his injuries in the car accident. He wrote his last letter to his brother G√∂ran, in which he described the state of his company, explained the structure of a new membrane that he was developing,Item a in Image labelled \\"Zu der Patentschrift 309535\\"described as \\"membran\\" in its caption , appears suitable to function as an acoustic diaphragm. and stated that he was about to undergo a kidney operation due to the spreading tuberculosis. Unfortunately, medical science was not advanced enough to be able to save his life. After his death, his brother travelled to America and brought his ashes home for burial in Helsinki. As with many inventors, Tigerstedt's inventions were never fully appreciated during his own lifetime.  Inventions  Tigerstedt experimented in many areas. He developed a new version of the shotgun that could be fired using the thumbs and that counted the number of shots fired. Unfortunately, he was perennially short of funds, and he did not have enough financial standing to file for a patent. =Sound-on-film technology= Tigerstedt's greatest interest was in the field of sound recording. He had developed a prototype for recording sound on a metal wire as early as 1912 and was convinced that he could find a way to record sound directly on motion picture film. He started his first experiments in Helsinki using very primitive equipment. The sentence he attempted to record was in German: \\"Grau ist alle Theorie. Gr√ºn ist nur des Lebens Baum\\". Finally, he succeeded and he called his invention the \\"photomagnetophone\\". Unfortunately, his achievements did not gain any recognition, nor did he reap any financial gains from his invention, so he had to maintain a day job in order to earn a modest living and could only continue his experiments in the evenings and into the nights, sometimes working all through the night without any sleep. After meeting his former schoolmate Alfred Nybom in Berlin, he succeeded in using Nybom's connections to gain access to a research laboratory and employment as an inventor. Film with audio was recognised as a commercially promising field of endeavour, but Tigerstedt's invention needed further development before it could be commercialised. There was as yet no technology available to electronically amplify the audio signal sufficiently to fill a large movie theatre. Tigerstedt also enlarged his vision of video transmission in the future. He wrote: \\"There will come a time when people can sit at home and follow events in the world through a device I now call the 'electronic eye'. When people get used to film with sound, they will soon adopt the electric eye, or electrophtalmoscope\\". When his father learned of his thinking, he tried to persuade him to not let his imagination carry him away, \\" ... otherwise you will surely end your days in the asylum in Lapinlahti.\\" Tigerstedt returned to Germany in 1913 and continued developing the photomagnetophone, but there was still no solution to the problem of amplification. He experimented with early versions of the vacuum tube and eventually was able to amplify the sound, but with disappointing results. Tigerstedt also continued developing the electrophtalmoscope. The prototype consisted of vibrating mirrors in both the sending and receiving apparatus, using the photoelectric properties of a selenium element at the sender and a light source at the receiving end which was modulated using a Faraday device. The received picture was supposed to be displayed on a movie screen. Two electrophtalmoscopes were built and an experiment was conducted using an electrical cable running from London to Berlin. Tigerstedt arranged several demonstrations and gained a reputation as a knowledgeable scientist. =Improving on Lee de Forest's vacuum tube= Tigerstedt stubbornly continued to grapple with the problems of the early vacuum tubes, which were inefficient, expensive and prone to breaking. His German colleagues told him that the vacuum tubes could not be developed further and that there could be no solution to the problem with the weakness of amplification. Tigerstedt, however, continued to experiment and eventually succeeded in substantially improving on the design of Lee De Forest, achieving much greater amplification than that of the original valves. Tigerstedt also patented his improvement of the triode vacuum valve, which consisted of improving the amplification by rearranging the electrodes cylindrically in the tube, changing the glass mold to prevent vacuum loss and using steel mirrors inside the tubes to prevent electrostatic interference. He had finally solved the most difficult practical problems of talking movies. It is worth noting that his achievement was purely experimental, as there were no prior experiments or mathematical models that he could have followed. =Patent for sound-on-film technology and expulsion from Germany= This was a major step forward for Tigerstedt, and he was soon able to show a film with sound which was electronically amplified and reproduced through a speaker system. Beginning in 1919, de Forest created his own sound-on-film system, which he called Phonofilm and which used some of Tigerstedt's concepts, along with some of the Tri-Ergon group and of inventor Theodore Case. Tigerstedt was awarded a German patent (number 309,536) on July 28, 1914 for his sound-on-film process. One month later, Tigerstedt was summoned by the German authorities, told that he had been declared an unwanted Russian citizen, and given three days to leave the country. World War I had started and Finland was at that time part of the Russian empire, having been ceded to Russia after the 1808-1809 war between Sweden and Russia. As another consequence of the declaration of war between Russia and Germany, the German government invalidated all German patents held by citizens of enemy nations. =Ultrasound experiments= Tigerstedt moved to Denmark, where he continued working on film sound recording devices at the Petersen & Poulsen company. He befriended the Danish inventor Valdemar Poulsen (1869‚Äì1942), who was the inventor of the telegraphone steel wire magnetic recorder. Tigerstedt, too, had experimented with recording sound on a steel wire. He attempted to transmit speech across the Jutland straits using 30 kHz ultrasound, but the results were not promising. He also experimented with transmitting sound underwater, which was more successful, and he was eventually granted a patent for this process. =Communication device= A pilot suggested to Tigerstedt that he should develop a device to facilitate communication between two pilots while seated one behind the other in an open biplane. Tigerstedt invented a device which had a very small earpiece that could be plugged into the ear. Tigerstedt spent considerable time on designing the earpiece. The device was also found to be helpful to people who were hard of hearing, offering a possible alternative to the large ear trumpets then in use as hearing aids.

An early supporter of women's suffrage, he was Member of Parliament (MP) for the Cheltenham constituency for four separate periods between 1874 and 1928, serving a total of 39 years in Parliament in which he made only two speeches in the House of Commons.  Early life  He was born in Cheltenham, where his father James Agg-Gardner, Senior (1804‚Äì58) had purchased the lordship of the manor in 1843. After his father's death, James Junior was brought up as a ward of court, and educated at Harrow School and then privately. He matriculated to Trinity College, Cambridge, but instead of starting his studies he contested the 1868 general election in Cheltenham, but failed to win the seat. He then studied law, and in 1873 he was called to the bar at the Middle Temple. However, he never practised law, concentrating instead on his business interests and his political career. He was a magistrate from 1875.  Political career  Agg- Gardner was first elected as Cheltenham's MP at the 1874 general election, but was defeated at the 1880 general election. He was re-elected in 1885 and held the seat until he stood down at the 1895 election, possibly for reasons related to his homosexuality. He was returned unopposed at the 1900 general election, but was defeated in the 1906 general election. He did not stand again until a by-election in April 1911, after which he held the seat until death in 1928. In the House of Commons chamber, he was an infrequent speaker, but served for most of his career on the Commons Kitchen Committee, which he chaired from 1917. In that role, he supervised the daily tea on the terrace, and was known affectionately as the \\"Minister of the Interior\\". He sponsored the parliamentary bill which conferred borough status on Cheltenham, and 1896 was made the first freeman of the borough. He also introduced bills on fire escapes (1891) and hire purchase (1928). He was knighted in 1916, and appointed as a Privy Councillor in 1924.London Gazette: 8 February 1924 By the time of his death in 1928, aged 81, he was the oldest serving Member of Parliament, having sat with ten Prime Ministers from Disraeli to Baldwin. However, because he was not continuously an MP, he did not hold the title of Father of the House.  Wine  Christie's has a library of its old auction catalogues, and many of the wine auctions in the first three decades of the twentieth century show bidding by \\"Agg-Gardner\\", sometimes successful.

Legends and History The origin of this Temple is steeped in mystery. There are no records available to fix the age of this temple except for a few references in Keralolpathi and Malabar Manual. According to Kerala Mahatmyam, this temple was consecrated by Lord Parashurama - one of the incarnations of Vishnu. Yet hearsay evidences point out that this temple is about 2000 years old. According to a legend this temple was consecrated by a sage named Swetharshi. The legend says Agasthya Muni on his way to River for offering his customary ablution was confronted by two demons named Neela and Swetha. Agasthya Muni cursed them. On their request for penance, Agasthya Muni advised them to perform Tapas at two Shiva Temples. The place where Neela performed Tapas came to be known as Neeleswaram. Swetha performed his Tapas at Thiruvangad (Tiru-van-kad, meaning the sacred dense forest). They were later known as Neelarshi and Swetharshi. It is said that Swetharshi consecrated a Shiva temple & Vishnu temple at the place where he performed his Tapas. It is believed that the Shiva installed by Swetharshi was very fierce, hence to calm its fury another Shiva temple was consecrated just opposite. Now the temple complex consists of two Shiva temples facing each other on the north side and the Big Sri Rama temple on the South. There is also a slightly different version of the legend, Which says that Shiva Temple was consecrated by Neelarshi - a Shiva Bhakta and Sree Rama temple was consecrated by Swetharshi - a Vishnu Bhakta. There are several authoritative references and records to suggest that the temple and its premises have witnessed the executions of several historical treaties and invasions. The earliest reference is possibly the inscription on the huge ‚ÄòBalikkallu‚Äô in front of the temple denoting the year of reconstruction of the temple as AD 826. The book \\"Kerala Charithram\\" refers to the occupation of Thalassery and Thiruvangad by the troops of Kolathu Nadu, Kadathanadu and Kottayam Raja in protest against the British Chief Dorin in 1750. When Hyder Ali of Mysore invaded the Chirakkal Palace of Kolathiri Raja in 1766, Kolathiri Royal family took refuge in this temple. The Seven storeyed ‚ÄòGopuram‚Äô in the front entrance is said to have been destroyed during the invasion of Tipu Sultan. The plinth of these walls and gopuram are still visible today. East India Company and the British were keen to protect the interest of this temple as evidenced in the references in the Logan's Malabar Manual. The \\"Brass pagoda\\" referred by William Logan is this temple. The inscription on the compound wall on the eastern side reads \\"the wall around this pagoda was constructed under the supervision of T.H. Baber Esq. in 1815\\". Baber, the then Sub Collector of Malabar was an ardent devotee and daily visitor to the temple premises who evinced immense interest in the affairs of the temple. Main Shrine The Main deity is that of a standing four armed Lord Vishnu with the concept of Sree Rama, his 7th avatar. The idol carved out in Krishna Shila. Three arms hold Shankha, Chakra, and Mace and the fourth is in the abhaya mudra (sign of blessing and Moksha). It is believed that the deity depicted here is the ‚ÄòPoorna Roopa‚Äô (full form) assumed by Sree Rama after annihilating the Khara, Thrisiras and Dooshana along with their fourteen thousand soldiers, thus having a fierce form. The idol is 6 ft tall and is consecrated facing east. The idol of Sree Hanuman is consecrated in front, slightly towards the left of Sree Rama; the pilgrims give equal importance to Sree Hanuman. The idol of Hanuman is made of Metal. The other sub deities are Sree Porkali Devi in the ‚ÄòNamaskara Mandapam‚Äô, Sree Subramanyan near Thidappally facing West, Sree Ganapathy and Sree Dakshinamoorty in the South Nada, Sree Vanasasthavu in the ‚ÄòPichakathara‚Äô, Sree Guruvayurappan (Lord Vishnu) on the north side facing East and various Thevara Moorthies (condemned idols) on the north side facing West. It is said that the idols of some of these minor deities might have been transferred from the neighbouring temples for safe custody during Tipu Sultan‚Äôs invasion. The same may be the case of recent additions of Vana Sastavu, Guruvayoorappan and Thevara Moorthis. The temple has some unique characteristics of architecture and is a treasure house of sculpture and paintings. The srikoil is rectangular in shape with two storeys, which are coppered roofed. The front portion is vertical and the rear and sides are sloped. There are three gold-plated stupis on the top ridge in the longitudinal direction at the entrance. The walls around the srikoil are embellished with images of Gods and Puranic figures. The administration of this Temple under the direct control of Malabar Devaswom Board governed by The Government Of Kerala. Main festivals The most important festival is the Vishu Mahotsavam which commences on Vishu with the hoisting of the ceremonial flag on Dhwaja Stambha. It lasts for seven days with the daily elephant processions, special poojas and various programs culminating on arattu or bathing the deity, on the last day in the temple tank. Kathakali, Chakyar Koothu, are performed on all days in addition to the temple rituals. Chakyar Koothu is performed in this temple as a part of rituals. Mani Chakyar family traditionally holds the right to perform here. The greatest Chakyar Koothu, Kutiyattam exponent Legendary Guru Mani Madhava Chakyar used to perform Chakyar Koothu here for decades.http://kerala- zone.com/destinations/kannur/thiruvangad- temple.phphttp://www.thalassery.info/religious/sreeramaswamy_temple.htm Guru Mani Madhava Chakyar performing Chakyar Koothu Pattathanam is another important function celebrated on the Thiruvonam day in the Malayalam calendar month of Makaram.

The Coral Reef Exhibit has 130 coral species and 120 fish species along with hundreds of species of sea stars, sea urchins, sea cucumbers, brittle stars, feather stars, snails, worms and sponges. History Reef HQ was originally the vision of Dr Graeme Kelleher, a former chairman of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA). Dr Kelleher's primary objective was to bring the marine environment onto the land and make it easily accessible to the public whilst also encouraging the public to help protect the reef. ReefHQ was originally known as Great Barrier Reef Aquarium when it opened on 14 June 1987. The aquarium was renamed \\"ReefHQ\\" in 1999. Since 2009 the name of the aquarium was changed to reflect its original name. It is now known as Reef HQ Great Barrier Reef Aquarium.

Florida, 368 U.S. 57 (1961), was an appeal by Gwendolyn Hoyt, who had killed her husband and received a jail sentence for second degree murder. Although she had suffered mental and physical abuse in her marriage and showed neurotic, if not psychotic, behavior, a six-man jury deliberated for just 25 minutes before finding her guilty. They sentenced her to 30 years of hard labor. Hoyt claimed that her all-male jury led to discrimination and unfair circumstances during her trial. The decision was subsequently overruled by Taylor v. Louisiana in 1975. Background Florida state law did not require women to serve on juries, unless they volunteered to do so. Most women in the state of Florida did not register, so they were exempted from jury services. The arguments put forward by the plaintiff suggested that there had been jury discrimination, and, moreover, that the Florida statute actively seeks to keep women from serving. This would be known as \\" the continuing validity\\". The continuing validity was jury slang for supporting the right to keep males as the primary, and only source, of jurors on these trials. This was argued in that women were excluded solely due to their sex. Men were automatically registered for duty, even if they had submitted an argument against serving. Women, however, had to actively register if they wished to serve. These women were merely recognized for their job of being \\"the center of home and family\\" and not in the courtroom. Decision In a unanimous opinion written by Justice John Marshall Harlan II, the Supreme Court of the United States held the Florida jury selection statute was not discriminatory. Harlan based his conclusion upon the theory of \\"reasonable classification,\\" which permits states to choose whom to include and exclude in jury selections. In oral arguments, it was noted that at the time, 17 other states also exempted women from jury duty unless they so chose to register and that at least, in this case, the jury was not selected unconstitutionally. The \\"practice of excluding women from the jury pool... it reasoned\\" was done to protect women \\"from the filth, obscenity, and obnoxious atmosphere... of the courtroom.\\"Dean John Champion, Richard D. Hartley, and Gary A. Rabe, \\"Criminal Courts,\\" p. 219 (2nd ed., Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson 2008), citing Hoyt v. Florida, 367 U.S. 57 (1961). Harlan held the right to an impartially-selected jury assured by the Fourteenth Amendment does not entitle one accused of crime to a jury tailored to the circumstances of the particular case; it requires only for the jury to be indiscriminately drawn from among those in the community eligible for jury service, irrespective of any arbitrary and systematic exclusions. Furthermore, Harlan held the Florida statute was not unconstitutional on its face since it was not constitutionally impermissible for a state to conclude that a woman should be relieved from jury service unless she herself determines that such service is consistent with her own special responsibilities. Harlan noted that the statute was based on a reasonable classification and so was constitutional. Because women were \\"still regarded as the center of home and family life,\\" Harlan found that the states could relieve them from the civic responsibility of jury duty unless they themselves determined that such service was consistent with their own \\"special responsibilities.\\" He also held that the case was distinct from other cases involving racial discrimination in jury selection and that male-female disproportions on jury lists carried no constitutional significance. In popular culture The movie On the Basis of Sex covers the Hoyt v. Florida case when Ruth Bader Ginsburg is teaching \\"Sex Discrimination and the Law\\". Ginsburg concludes her lesson by telling her students that this case showed \\"Discrimination on the basis of sex is legal.\\" See also *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 368 * Women in United States juries Further reading * References External links * Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Warren Court Category:Overruled United States Supreme Court decisions Category:1961 in United States case law Category:Batson challenge case law ","title":"Hoyt v.

Store norske leksikon. 5 December 2014. As a senior civil servant, he had to quit his job to stand as a candidate for the 2005 parliamentary election, while only willing to do so if nominated for his party's third spot in Oslo.\\"Hagens h√∏yre h√•nd kan bli vraket\\". VG. 16 November 2004. Political career Tybring-Gjedde has been a member of the anti-immigration Progress Party since 1979, when he was attending secondary school. He was elected to his first public office in the 2003 local elections for the Oslo city council, while having been deputy chairman of the party's Oslo chapter from 2001 until then. He held the local office until 2005 when he was elected to parliament, having secured the party nomination after Geir Mo dropped out from the contest for the third place on its Oslo list (the top two spots taken by Siv Jensen and Carl I. Hagen).\\"Klar for personkrig\\". VG. 4 December 2004.\\"Geir Mo trekker seg fra stortings-kamp\\". VG. 14 December 2004. He was reelected to parliament in 2009 and in 2013 on a more secure second spot only behind party leader Jensen. For his first two terms he served as a member of the Standing Committee on Finance and Economic Affairs, and since 2013 he has been a member of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. Tybring-Gjedde was the leader of the Progress Party's Oslo chapter from 2010, until announcing his withdrawal in 2014.\\"Anti- immigrant Progress Oslo head resigns\\". The Local. 7 January 2014.\\"Tybring- Gjedde trekker seg som Frp-leder\\". VG. 6 January 2014. Following the Progress Party's government entrance in 2013, Tybring-Gjedde has been outspoken in his belief that the party has compromised too much on the immigration issue. As the only Progress Party member of parliament, he voted against the government's finalised immigration agreement with the Liberal and Christian Democratic parties, and later wrote a letter to the Progress Party leadership requesting to be allowed to vote according to his own persuasion on immigration-issues in parliament; dissatisfied with the response, he claimed he would \\"give up\\" immigration politics.\\"Tybring-Gjedde vil fristilles i innvandringssaker\\". VG/NTB. 11 March 2014.\\"Tybring-Gjedde gir opp innvandringspolitikk\\". NRK. 31 March 2014. He did not attend the party's 2014 national convention, considering he had \\"no tasks\\" there, and announced he would publish a book later that year.\\"Tybring-Gjedde med bok\\". Dagsavisen. 4 July 2014. The conflict has prompted media speculation that he may be on his way to leaving the party, although he has rejected this himself.\\"Politisk flyktning\\". Dagens N√¶ringsliv. 12 March 2014.\\"Tybring-Gjedde blir i politikken\\". P4. 17 November 2014. In 2015 he was assigned second deputy leader of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. Immigration debate Since his second parliamentary term, Tybring-Gjedde has become known for his outspoken criticism of Norwegian immigration policy. In 2020 he spearheaded an attempt within his party to declare Norway a \\"patriotic beacon\\"; summarising the core content of this policy, he said his party should call for \\"a complete ban on non-western immigration\\" and a referendum on immigration, arguing that \\"we have no duty to abolish our own people\\". Political scientist Sindre Bangstad has described him as one of the \\"main traffickers in extreme right-wing rhetorical tropes about Islam and Muslims\\" in Norway. Demanding immigrants to adjust to Norwegian society, he has previously said that immigration to Norway should be \\"dramatically reduced\\", proposing at the time to only give temporary residence permits to asylum seekers, and to withdraw residence permits for asylum seekers \\"going on vacation\\" back to countries they have reported to have fled from. Critical of Islamic influence and lack of \\"freedom values\\", he has compared the hijab to Ku Klux Klan and Nazi outfits, considering it an \\"Islamic uniform\\", and said that Norway should take a \\"tough stand\\" against Islamisation \\"happening before our eyes\\". As member of the Norwegian parliament, in 2006 he nominated Islam- critical filmmaker Ayaan Hirsi Ali for the Nobel Peace Prize.\\"Drapstruet filmskaper foresl√•tt til Nobelprisen\\". BA. 15 January 2006. He gained widespread publicity and controversy in August 2010 when he co-authored an op- ed in Aftenposten titled \\"Dream from Disneyland\\", where he strongly criticized what he described as the Labour Party-led immigration policy.\\"Sp√•mannen\\". Dagbladet: Magasinet. 11 January 2013. The feature said that the immigration was threatening to \\"tear Norway apart\\", and that the Labour Party had stabbed the Norwegian culture in the back. He subsequently claimed to represent the majority of Norwegians on the issue, claiming to be \\"mainstream in Norway\\" and \\"saying what you hear at parties\\". Met with accusations of holding \\"racist views\\", he has described such accusations as \\"frustrating and as far from the truth as possible\\". In his speech at the 2011 Progress Party national convention in May he devoted much time to attacking the conditions he described that ethnic Norwegians were living under in the multicultural suburb of Grorud Valley in Oslo. The Labour Party's Jonas Gahr St√∏re denounced the speech as \\"bordering on the hateful\\". The Labour Party's youth organisation AUF filed charges of racism against Tybring-Gjedde for the speech and for subsequent statements to the media claiming that immigrant boys are more hot- headed than Norwegian boys, but the police eventually dropped the charges as \\"no criminal offense\\".\\"AUF anmelder Frp-topp for rasisme\\". TV 2. 26 May 2011.\\"Christian Tybring-Gjedde refser statsministeren\\". TV 2. 1 July 2011. He sparked a wide public debate about Norwegian culture in 2012/13 after asking Culture Minister Hadia Tajik and Integration Minister Inga Marte Thorkildsen to define Norwegian culture, and if they believed it to be important to protect. Their responses led him to accuse them of \\"denying Norwegian culture\\".\\"- Fornekter norsk kultur\\". Dagbladet. 12 December 2012. In 2014 he released his book discussing immigration politics titled Mens orkesteret fortsetter √• spille (\\"While the orchestra continues playing\\"; alluding to events in the sinking of the Titanic). In the book, he described how he believed Norway would face economic and cultural ruin in just a few years time due to too high immigration, poor integration and high welfare costs. In order to control Norway's borders more tightly, he called for reconsidering Norway's ratification of the United Nations Refugee Convention by Article 44, believing its establishment in 1951 to have been designed for an entirely different time than the modern migrant situation. He also suggested to dissolve the modern asylum system, and transport all incoming asylum seekers to an international centre to have their applications processed.\\"Slik vil han stenge Norges grenser\\". Nettavisen. 17.11.14. Climate change Tybring-Gjedde has on several occasions rejected the scientific consensus on climate change and called it \\"climate hysteria\\"; in an interview with Dagsavisen in 2011, Tybring-Gjedde stated that \\"I don't believe in the climate hysteria.\\" In 2016, Tybring-Gjedde and six other Progress Party parliamentarians proposed that their party adopted the position that \\"the Progress Party believes that climate change is a result of natural variations and rejects the claim that climate change is a result of humans' low level of emissions of greenhouse gases.\\" In 2020 Tybring-Gjedde said that his party should focus more on the view that \\"climate change is not man-made\\". He also said his party should support Folkeoppr√∏ret mot klimahysteriet, a Facebook-based self-described \\"revolt against the climate hysteria.\\" Foreign politics Tybring-Gjedde has stated that he is opposed to Norwegian membership of the European Union. He has proposed for Norway to challenge the European Economic Area and the Schengen Agreement, and potentially consider other forms of cooperation. A member of the pro-Israel parliamentary caucus Friends of Israel in the Parliament of Norway, Tybring-Gjedde has made appearances in pro-Israel demonstrations, and has criticised Foreign Minister B√∏rge Brende for being \\"unbalanced\\" and \\"naive\\" in his approach to the conflict in Gaza.\\"Frp g√•r ut mot B√∏rge Brende\\". Klassekampen. 25 July 2014. He has called for rejecting any pressure to follow Sweden's move in 2014 of recognising Palestine prior to an agreement has been reached between the two parties in the conflict.\\"Israels rett til √• eksistere\\". Dagbladet. 17 November 2014. When Mads Gilbert was denied entry to Gaza through Israel the same year, Tybring-Gjedde voiced his understanding of Israel's decision, stating that the country had the full right to deny Gilbert entrance.\\"Tybring-Gjedde om innreisenekt: ‚Äì Finnes andre konflikter Gilbert kan engasjere seg i\\". NRK. 14 November 2014. His fierce defence of Israel and rhetoric on Islam has led him to be compared to Dutch politician Geert Wilders by the Norwegian Centre Against Racism.\\"Sammenlikner Tybring-Gjedde med h√∏yre-ekstrem, nederlandsk politiker\\". Dagbladet. 11 April 2014. In other issues Tybring-Gjedde has voiced opinions contradicting his party's official policy. In response to the conflict in Ukraine, Tybring- Gjedde has criticised Western countries for too strongly condemning Russia's actions, and has called for the use of more caution towards Russia as well as to help Vladimir Putin \\"to save face\\".\\"Vesten overreagerer\\".

He has also voiced his scepticism of sending Norwegian soldiers to Iraq to train Iraqi soldiers against ISIL, fearing that doing so would increase the risk of terrorism in Norway, as well as not leading to peace and democracy in the region.\\"Frp-profil frykter f√∏lgene av Irak-beslutningen\\". Dagbladet. 30 October 2014. Previously however he had called for Norway to join the United States' coalition against ISIL.\\"- Norge m√• bidra millit√¶rt for √• knuse IS\\". Nettavisen. 15.09.14.

Since 2019 Tybring-Gjedde has been a leading figure in a party faction that seeks to replace the party's ideology with a \\"Norway first\\" ideology with an emphasis on anti-immigration and rejection of the scientific consensus on climate change, and in 2020 he spearheaded an attempt to declare Norway a \\"patriotic beacon\\". He said that the party should move in a national conservative direction and that \\"very few people agree\\" with the stated ideology of liberalism in the party programme because \\"liberalism in its extreme form means open borders\\" and because he views liberalism as a dead ideology.Tybring-Gjedde presser p√• for mer nasjonal Frp-utgave, V√•rt Land, 17 September 2019 Tybring-Gjedde has called for his party to cooperate more with the Sweden Democrats and to invite Jimmie √Ökesson to his party's national convention.Frp-topper: ‚Äì Det er for sent for Sverige, TV2, 5 September 2018 He has questioned his party's decision to cooperate with the Conservative Party;Tybring-Gjedde fillerister sitt eget parti i ny bok, Aftenposten the conservative magazine Minerva has described him as a representative of the \\"alternative right\\".Det alternative h√∏yre, Minerva The Christian centrist newspaper V√•rt Land has compared his positions to those of Alternative for Germany.

She is the lead ship of her namesake class, which includes Carnival Magic, Carnival Breeze, and Costa Diadema. Built by Fincantieri at its Monfalcone shipyard in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, northern Italy, she was floated out on October 24, 2008, and christened by Marcia Gay Harden. At , Carnival Dream was once the largest Carnival Cruise Ship. It lost this title to the Carnival Magic, when it was introduced in 2011. Facilities The vessel under construction in 2008 Carnival Dream and her sisters were the largest ships ever built by Fincantieri until the introduction of the Vista-class ships in 2016, which were also built by Fincantieri. The ship was the first in the Carnival fleet to include a water park with multiple slides. She also has an 18-hole miniature golf course and a wide outdoor promenade deck that includes an outdoor cafe and a whirlpool Jacuzzi in four places along the outside edge of the deck.  Areas of operation  Carnival Dream has been based in several US ports cruising to Caribbean destinations. The ship was based in New Orleans, Louisiana up until late 2019 when she was re-positioned to Galveston, Texas.  Successors  The Carnival Dream not only introduced the Dream-Class of cruise ships. But highly influenced Carnival's highly popular Vista-class of ships. Incidents and accidents In July 2011, Carnival Dream had issues with one of her engines, forcing a change in her travel schedule. On March 14, 2013, Carnival Dream experienced a back-up generator malfunction while performing regular pre-embarkation testing. No power outages occurred but Carnival Cruise Line decided to stay docked in port at Philipsburg, Sint Maarten. The ship was scheduled to leave port around 5 p.m. ET the day before. The U.S. Coast Guard said they were notified by Carnival Cruise Lines that Carnival Dream was experiencing problems with her generator. Carnival was paying to fly passengers back to Port Canaveral, via Orlando International Airport, or their home cities and canceled Dream's March 16 departure. The ship set sail on her first cruise after the mechanical problems on March 23. Michael Moses Ward, also known as Birdie Africa, the only child survivor of the 1985 MOVE bombing, died in September 2013, at the age of 41. His death occurred in a hot tub aboard Carnival Dream while sailing in the Caribbean. Initial reports indicated an accidental drowning. Sources say he may have had a stroke in the hot tub. On May 3, 2018, a pipe, which was part of the ship's fire suppression system, burst and flooded deck 9. About 50 staterooms were affected by the flood. On December 29, 2018, lifeboat number 28 broke loose from Carnival Dream for unknown reasons and was excessively damaged. Carnival decided to abandon the lifeboat at sea and plans to purchase a new replacement. No one was on board the lifeboat at the time and no injuries were reported. On October 24, 2019, a few hours after Carnival Dream left Galveston, Texas, a man went overboard by jumping off his stateroom balcony. Carnival stated \\"the ship's command promptly began search and rescue procedures, returned to the area near where the incident occurred and notified the US Coast Guard.\\" However, after 586 square miles covered by the search in 48 hours, the US Coast Guard suspended operations.https://abc13.com/search- suspended-for-man-who-jumped-off-carnival-cruise-ship/5645425/  Appearances in film  About 20 minutes of the movie Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked was filmed aboard Carnival Dream. In the film World War Z, upon entering the command center of the Naval Vessel the main characters land on, a sailor is seen announcing the authorization for Carnival Dream to join the fleet.

Bergson The work of Henri Bergson (1859‚Äì1941)http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bergson/ is often considered the division point between nineteenth- and twentieth-century French philosophy. Essentially, despite his respect for mathematics and science, he pioneered the French movement of scepticism towards the use of scientific methods to understand human nature and metaphysical reality. Positivism, which, for instance, the French sociologist Durkheim was interested in at the time, was not appropriate, he argued. Unlike later philosophers, Bergson was highly influenced by biology, particularly Darwin's Origin of Species, which was published in the year Bergson was born. This led Bergson to discuss the 'Body' and 'Self' in detail, arguably prompting the fundamental ontological and epistemological questions to be raised later in the 20th century. Bergson's work was a major influence on Gilles Deleuze, who wrote a monograph on him (Bergsonism) and whose philosophical analyses of cinema (Cinema 1: The Movement Image and Cinema 2: The Time-Image) develop his ideas.  Philosophy of science  Following debates concerning the foundation of mathematics around the mathematician and philosopher Henri Poincar√© (1854‚Äì1912), who opposed Bertrand Russell and Frege, various French philosophers started working on philosophy of science, among them Gaston Bachelard, who developed a discontinuous view of scientific progress, Jean Cavaill√®s (1903‚Äì1944), Jules Vuillemin (1920-2001), or Georges Canguilhem, who would be a strong influence of Michel Foucault ; in his introduction to Canguilhem's The Normal and the Pathological, Foucault wrote: > Take away Canguilhem and you will no longer understand much about Althusser, > Althusserism and a whole series of discussions which have taken place among > French Marxists; you will no longer grasp what is specific to sociologists > such as Bourdieu, Robert Castel, Jean-Claude Passeron and what marks them so > strongly within sociology; you will miss an entire aspect of the theoretical > work done by psychoanalysts, particularly by the followers of Lacan. > Further, in the entire discussion of ideas which preceded or followed the > movement of '68, it is easy to find the place of those who, from near or > from afar, had been trained by Canguilhem. Starting in the 1980s, Bruno Latour (b. 1947), teacher at the engineering school √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des mines de Paris, would develop the actor- network theory, a distinctive approach to social theory and research, best known for its controversial insistence on the agency of nonhumans.  The Sorbonne  Many philosophers and historians of philosophy were teachers at the Sorbonne, the University of Paris, including L√©on Brunschvicg French philosophy in the twentieth century, Gary Gutting, Cambridge University Press, 2001, p. 40 (1869‚Äì1944), co-founder of the Revue de M√©taphysique et de Morale with Xavier L√©on and Elie Hal√©vy, Martial Gu√©roult (1891‚Äì1976) and successor of √âtienne Gilson at the Coll√®ge de France in 1951, Ferdinand Alqui√©, Paul Ric≈ìur, etc. Jean Wahl taught between 1936 and 1967 and helped introduce the philosophy of S√∏ren Kierkegaard to French thinkers. Personalism Emmanuel Mounier (1905‚Äì1950) was a guiding spirit in the French personalist movement, and founder and director of Esprit, the magazine which was the organ of the movement. Mounier, who was the child of peasants, was a brilliant scholar at the Sorbonne. In 1929, when he was only twenty-four, he came under the influence of the French writer, Charles P√©guy, to whom he ascribed the inspiration of the personalist movement. Gabriel Honor√© Marcel (1889‚Äì1973) was a leading Catholic existentialist and the author of about 30 plays. He shared a great deal in common with Mounier's ideas. They both show Bergson's influence in their assessment of 'being', specifically the Mystery of Being. Interest of Mounier and Marcel in the problems of technology moved French philosophy forward. Jean-Paul Sartre and Existentialism Sartre (1905‚Äì1980) was, if only by birth, the first truly 20th-century French philosopher. He was probably also the most famous, as a dramatist, screenwriter, novelist and critic. Sartre popularized (and named) existentialism, making it better known to the lay-person than, for instance, deconstruction. Phenomenology and Marxism were two other key concerns of his. A leading figure of the French Left, Sartre was opposed on his right by Raymond Aron. Merleau-Ponty Maurice Merleau Ponty (1908‚Äì1961) was a French phenomenologist philosopher, strongly influenced by Edmund Husserl. Merleau-Ponty is classified as an existentialist thinker because of his close association with Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, and his distinctly Heideggerian conception of Being. Marxist philosophers It is important to realise that, as well as holding many varying degrees and interpretations of Marxism, many French Philosophers' views on it shifted substantially during their lifetime. Sartre, for instance, became more influenced by Marx during the course of his life. Alexandre Koj√®ve (1902‚Äì1968) was a Marxist and Hegelian political philosopher, who had a substantial influence on intellectual life in France in the 1930s and on the reading of Hegel in France. Louis Althusser (1918‚Äì1990) was a key Marxist philosopher, sometimes considered to be the structuralist equivalent to Marxism that Lacan was to Psychoanalysis and Claude L√©vi-Strauss to ethnology (although all of them rejected the identification). In 'Lenin and Philosophy', Althusser explained Lenin's differentiation between [Dialectical Materialism] and [Historical Materialism]. He said the former was the philosophy and the latter was the science, and claimed that in history science has always preceded Philosophy. One of his seminal works was Reading Capital (1965), co- written with √âtienne Balibar, Roger Establet, Jacques Ranci√®re and Pierre Macherey. He opposed Hegel's teleological approach to history, drew on Bachelard's concept of \\"epistemological break\\" and defined philosophy as \\"class struggle in theory.\\" Other Marxist authors include Henri Lefebvre (1901‚Äì1999), who partly influenced the Situationist and Guy Debord, the group Socialisme ou Barbarie aforementioned, Althusser's students Etienne Balibar (author of The Philosophy of Marx), Jacques Rancierre, and perhaps most prominently, Alain Badiou. Badiou's most well-known work is undoubtedly Being and Event, but his analysis of the May 68 revolts in The Communist Hypothesis is well known as well. Recently, Slavoj Zizek has gained prominence as a French Marxist of Slovene origin, primarily for his re-reading of Marx using Lacan and Hegel. Structuralism The structuralist movement in French philosophy was highly influenced by the Swiss thinker Ferdinand de Saussure (1857‚Äì1913). His ideas laid the foundation for many of the significant developments in linguistics in the 20th century. He is widely considered the 'father' of 20th-century linguistics. This current was further explored by Claude-Levi Strauss in ethnology. His work influenced important figures like Jacques Derrida and Jacques Lacan significantly. From 1963, a magazine was run in Paris, called Tel Quel, which also dabbled excessively in structuralist analysis of texts. Important figures in this endeavour were Phillip Sollers, the magazine's editor, Julia Kristeva and Roland Barthes. Jacques Lacan (1901‚Äì1981) was specifically interested in the philosophy of psychoanalysis. He could be said to be relevant to the more modern foundations of discursive psychology. Post-structuralism Post-structuralism is, like structuralism, an ambiguous term in some respect. It is first important to understand the nature of the schools of thought - as often it seems they aren't truly separate 'schools' at all. Much like Sartre's interest in art, both of these movements are important to a wide range of academic disciplines. E.g., English literature, cultural studies, media studies/film studies, anthropology, etc. etc. Michel Foucault (1926‚Äì1984), although sometimes considered close to structuralism, quickly drew apart from this movement, developing a specific approach to semiology and history which he dubbed \\"archeology.\\" His influence is broad-ranging, and his work includes books such as Madness and Civilization (1961), The Order of Things (1966), Discipline and Punish: The Birth of Prison (1975) or The History of Sexuality. Gilles Deleuze, who wrote the Anti-Oedipus (1972) with F√©lix Guattari, criticizing psychoanalysis, was, like Foucault, one of the key thinkers who introduced a thorough reading of Nietzsche in France, following Georges Bataille's early attempts -- Bataille published the Ac√©phale review from 1936 to 1939, along with Pierre Klossowski, another close reader of Nietzsche, Roger Caillois and Jean Wahl. Deleuze wrote books such as Difference and Repetition, The Logic of Sense, Spinoza: Practical Philosophy (1970), and also wrote on Bergson, Leibniz, Nietzsche, etc., as well as other works on cinema (Cinema 1: The Movement Image). Both Deleuze and Foucault attempted to take distance from the strong influence of Marxism and psychoanalysis in their works, in part by means of a radical reinterpretation of Marx and Freud. Jacques Derrida (1930‚Äì2004) was an Algerian-born French philosopher, known as the founder of deconstruction. His voluminous work had a profound impact upon continental philosophy and literary theory. Jean-Fran√ßois Lyotard (1924‚Äì1998) was a philosopher and literary theorist. He is well known for his articulation of Postmodernism after the late 1970s. Other authors include Jean Baudrillard, who started with a situationist criticism of Consumption Society in the 1970s to evolve towards a reflection on simulation and virtual reality, Paul Virilio, both a philosopher and an urbanist, Cornelius Castoriadis, who was, along with Claude Lefort, co-founder of Socialisme ou Barbarie and criticized orthodox Marxism, Alain Badiou, Fran√ßois Laruelle, who developed \\"Non-philosophy\\" starting in the 1980s, Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, Paul Ricoeur (administrator of the University of Nanterre during May '68), Emmanuel Levinas, Vincent Descombes, etc. 20th-century French feminism The Feminist movement in contemporary France (or at least that which can be placed in the 'Philosophy' genre) is characterised more by deconstructionism and Marxism than much Anglo-American Feminism. Key thinkers include psychoanalytic and cultural theorist Luce Irigaray (born 1930), psychoanalyst and writer Julia Kristeva (born 1941), writer and philosopher Simone de Beauvoir, writer and cultural theorist Helen Cixous and artist and psychoanalyst Bracha Ettinger. Important influences One suggested way of understanding French philosophy of this period, it has been suggested, is to locate the major influential figures in their current. The major influences were primarily 6 Germans from preceding eras - Hegel, Marx, Freud, Nietzsche, Husserl, Heidegger. For example, Alexander Kojeve's Lectures on the Phenomenology of Spirit were quite a sensation in Paris in the 1930s. It was attended by George Batailles and a young Jacques Lacan among others. Jean Wahl and Jean Hippolyte were also responsible for spreading Hegel's lectures into Parisian circles. Marx was introduced to philosophers both inside and outside the university. Many, like Sartre and Merleau-Ponty, grew up during the Resistance against Nazi occupation, during which time they were introduced to Marxist-Leninists. Nietzsche's influence went through George Batailles and the Acephale group, down to Foucault and Deleuze. The Acephale group is partly responsible for reclaiming Nietzsche for Western Philosophy, after decades of Nazi appropriation. Heidegger and Husserl's influence was felt, firstly, in the existential-phenomenology of Sartre and Merleau-Ponty. Even Simon de Beauvoir's feminism borrowed extensively from this current. She used phenomenological conceptualizations of consciousness, time and memory to conceptualize Woman. Later, most famously, Jacques Derrida deconstructed Husserl in Of Grammatology. Finally, Freud was most avidly championed by Jacques Lacan's \\"return to Freud\\". Lacan's lectures caused a stir in Parisian intellectual circles akin to Alexander Kojeve's a generation earlier. Attended only by clinical trainees at first, as time wore on Lacan opened up his seminars to philosophers and artists of various kinds. Lacan's writings impacted the whole generation - while Louis Althusser found the theoretical apparatus in Lacan to talk about interpellation and ideology, Jacques Alain Miller, Althusser's student at first, would go on to become Lacan's most devoted follower. The French Feminists - Irigaray, Kristeva, Cixous, responded to Lacan in various ways, and perhaps most famously, Deleuze and Guattari's Anti-Oedipus presented a strong critique of the practise of psychoanalysis. The role of politics 20th century French philosophers lived through several very important political upheavals during their time. On the one hand, there was the Resistance against the Nazi forces. For Sartre and Merleau- Ponty, this was the first introduction to communism. Later, they would both become members of the PCF. The other important political event of that era was the Algerian War of Independence, to which the young Foucault, Derrida and Frantz Fanon went. While the PCF had a problematic role to play, dissident Marxist-Leninists of that era went there to help rebelling Algerians. Undoubtedly, for the next generation, the great political upheaval was the student-worker protests of May 1968. Young radicals, from the Sorborne and Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure organized, went to the factories and encouraged the worker's to go on strike. Many young radicals broke away from Marxism‚ÄìLeninism towards Maoism at this point, while there were several Anarchists, Trotskyites, Situationists etc. at the protests as well. Each of these events have shaped the content as well as the form of the writing of these French philosophers. Time and again, the movements have questioned the French state, the university, imperialism and capitalism as well. This has provided impetus, material and structural change to the current of French philosophy consistently.

History =Early history= The first opera staged during the Ottoman period is usually attributed to the reign of Selim III (1761‚Äì1808), when Selim, himself a composer and a poet, invited a foreign company to stage an opera at the Topkapƒ± Palace in 1797. In 1840, Gaetano Donizetti's Belisario became the first opera to be translated into Turkish, and was performed at the newly built theatre by Italian architect Bosco. The theater was transferred to T√ºt√ºnc√ºoƒülu Michael Naum Efendi in 1844, who continued to arrange opera performances for the following 26 years. An important public opera performance was Giuseppe Verdi's Ernani, staged by an Italian company in Beyoƒülu in 1846. Also in 1846, Naum Efendi's theatre was destroyed by fire and was replaced by a new one. During the period of 1846‚Äì1877, operas of Verdi, performed mostly by Italian companies, reached a wide audience. One of the earliest Turkish operettas was Leblebici Horhor (Horhor the chickpea seller),Metin Heper, Sabri Sayari - The Routledge Handbook of Modern Turkey Page 99 2012 \\"Leblebici Horhor was written in 1875, and played for many years in the French theater in Beyog ÃÜlu.

The first opera in Turkish was staged in 1840.\\" As with other arts, the development of Turkish opera and ballet was brought to a halt from the 1880s by almost constant warfare, peaking in the Balkan Wars and World War I which resulted in the collapse of the empire. =Republican period= The foundation of the new Republic of Turkey in 1923 was followed by Atat√ºrk's Reforms, of which far-reaching cultural reforms were an important step. Under Atat√ºrk's personal guidance, many talented young people were sent to Europe for professional training, who, upon their return during the 1930s, became teachers of music and performing arts at the newly established Musiki Muallim Mektebi in Ankara (opened in 1924) and Dar√ºlelhan in ƒ∞stanbul. The first Turkish opera, √ñzsoy, composed by Ahmet Adnan Saygun to a libretto by M√ºnir Hayri Egeli, premiered in 1934. It was shortly followed by Adnan Saygun's Ta≈übebek and Necil Kazƒ±m Akses‚Äôs Bay √ñnder. During 1935, German composer Paul Hindemith and theatre director Carl Ebert were invited to give lectures at Musiki Muallim Mektebi in Ankara, which was subsequently transformed into Ankara State Conservatory. The two lecturers were offered permanent posts at the conservatory, an offer which Paul Hindemith was not able to accept. Nevertheless, he kept visiting Ankara and inspecting the activities at the music school. Carl Ebert stayed in Ankara as the director of the conservatory theatre school and opera studio for the following nine years. On May 16, 1940, the State Conservatory was firmly established under law, comprising music, opera, ballet, and theatre schools. The first performance staged by the students of the conservatory was Mozart's one-act comic opera Bastien und Bastienne, performed with Turkish text in the accompaniment of the Turkish Presidential Symphony Orchestra. In 1940, the second act of Puccini's Madama Butterfly was performed in Turkish by the staff of the conservatory opera studio, followed in 1941 by Tosca. The conversion of the existing Sergievi (Exhibition House) building in Ankara into an opera house was started in 1947 and the building started serving as the Ankara Opera House on April 2, 1948, with the performance of pieces composed by the Turkish Five and the premiere of Ahmet Adnan Saygun's Kerem. The organization of the opera orchestra and chorus was completed between 1950‚Äì1953. During the same period, a ballet school was established in ƒ∞stanbul with prima ballerina Ninette de Valois, which was later integrated into Ankara State Conservatory, giving its first graduates in 1956. Management of the theatre and the opera were separated in 1958, creating the directorates of Turkish State Theatres and State Opera and Ballet. In 1959, the ƒ∞stanbul City Opera was established by the private effort of Aydƒ±n G√ºn, and it was nationalized in 1970 as the ƒ∞stanbul State Opera and Ballet. This was followed by the establishment of ƒ∞zmir State Opera and Ballet in 1983, Mersin State Opera and Ballet in 1992, and Antalya State Opera and Ballet in 1999.

It is a complete re-design and re-write of the widely used Apache Axis SOAP stack. Implementations of Axis2 are available in Java and C. Axis2 provides the capability to add Web services interfaces to Web applications. It can also function as a standalone application server. Why Apache Axis2 A new architecture for Axis2 was introduced during the August 2004 Axis2 Summit in Colombo, Sri Lanka. The new architecture on which Axis2 is based is more flexible, efficient and configurable in comparison to Axis1.x architecture. Some well-established concepts from Axis 1.x, like handlers etc., have been preserved in the new architecture. Apache Axis2 supports SOAP 1.1 and SOAP 1.2, and it has integrated support for the widely popular REST style of Web services. The same business-logic implementation can offer both a WS-* style interface as well as a REST/POX style interface simultaneously. Axis2/Java has support for Spring Framework. Axis2/C is a high-performance Web services implementation. It has been implemented with portability and ability to be embedded or hosted in Apache Httpd, Microsoft IIS or Axis Http Server. See article about Apache Axis2/C Performance (2008). Latest release occurred on 2009 . Axis2 came with many new features, enhancements and industry specification implementations. Key features offered include: Axis2 Features Apache Axis2 includes support for following standards: *WS - ReliableMessaging - Via Apache Sandesha2 *WS - Coordination - Via Apache Kandula2 *WS - AtomicTransaction - Via Apache Kandula2 *WS - SecurityPolicy - Via Apache Rampart *WS - Security - Via Apache Rampart *WS - Trust - Via Apache Rampart *WS - SecureConversation - Via Apache Rampart *SAML 1.1 - Via Apache Rampart *SAML 2.0 - Via Apache Rampart *WS - Addressing - Module included as part of Axis2 core Below a list of features and selling points cited from the Apache axis site: *Speed - Axis2 uses its own object model and StAX (Streaming API for XML) parsing to achieve significantly greater speed than earlier versions of Apache Axis. *Low memory foot print - Axis2 was designed ground-up keeping low memory foot print in mind. *AXIOM - Axis2 comes with its own light-weight object model, AXIOM, for message processing which is extensible, optimized for performance, and simplified for developers. *Hot Deployment - Axis2 is equipped with the capability of deploying Web services and handlers while the system is up and running. In other words, new services can be added to the system without having to shut down the server. Simply drop the required Web service archive into the services directory in the repository, and the deployment model will automatically deploy the service and make it available for use. *Asynchronous Web services - Axis2 now supports asynchronous Web services and asynchronous Web services invocation using non-blocking clients and transports. *MEP Support - Axis2 now comes handy with the flexibility to support Message Exchange Patterns (MEPs) with in-built support for basic MEPs defined in WSDL 2.0. *Flexibility - The Axis2 architecture gives the developer complete freedom to insert extensions into the engine for custom header processing, system management, and anything else you can imagine. *Stability - Axis2 defines a set of published interfaces which change relatively slowly compared to the rest of Axis. *Component-oriented Deployment - You can easily define reusable networks of Handlers to implement common patterns of processing for your applications, or to distribute to partners. *Transport Framework - We have a clean and simple abstraction for integrating and using Transports (i.e., senders and listeners for SOAP over various protocols such as SMTP, FTP, message-oriented middleware, etc.), and the core of the engine is completely transport-independent. *WSDL support - Axis2 supports the Web Services Description Language, version 1.1 and 2.0, which allows you to easily build stubs to access remote services, and also to automatically export machine-readable descriptions of your deployed services from Axis2. *Add-ons - Several Web services specifications have been incorporated including WSS4J for security (Apache Rampart), Sandesha for reliable messaging, Kandula which is an encapsulation of WS-Coordination, WS-AtomicTransaction and WS- BusinessActivity. *Composition and Extensibility - Modules and phases improve support for composability and extensibility. Modules support composability and can also support new WS-* specifications in a simple and clean manner. They are however not hot deployable as they change the overall behavior of the system.

History of the area Newtown Creek The areas of the northeast industrial section of Greenpoint along Newtown Creek were home to oil refineries from the 1840s, and by 1870 boasted more than 50 petroleum processing plants, many of which were incorporated into the Standard Oil Trust towards the end of the century.

In 2007 a report by the United States Environmental Protection Agency on the spill raised the estimated size of the contaminated area to and the estimated spillage volume to , three times larger than the Exxon Valdez spill. The report also criticized the recovery efforts and a recent slowdown of the clean up. According to an Environmental Protection Agency study, \\"the American Petroleum Institute (2002) indicates that 40% to 80% of a product spill may be retained in soils as residual product\\".

It is based on the manga series of the same name, recounting the tale of Yuki, a woman who seeks vengeance upon three of the people who raped her mother and killed her father and brother. The film's narrative is told out of chronological order, jumping between present and past events. Lady Snowblood was released theatrically in Japan on December 1, 1973, and was distributed by Toho. It spawned a sequel, Love Song of Vengeance (1974), and served as inspiration for the Quentin Tarantino film Kill Bill. Plot In 1874, a deathly-ill woman named Sayo gives birth to a baby girl in a women's prison. Naming the child Yuki from seeing the snow outside, Sayo confided to the inmates who helped deliver the baby how she was brutally raped by three of the four criminals who murdered her husband Tora and their son Shiro a year ago. While she managed to stab her captor Shokei Tokuichi to death when the chance presented itself, she was arrested and imprisoned for life. Sayo then seduced many prison guards in order to conceive Yuki. Her final words were for the child to be raised to carry out the vengeance against the three remaining tormentors. In Meiji 15 (1882), the child Yuki undergoes brutal training in sword fighting under the priest D≈çkai to become her mother's wrath incarnate. Yuki, now twenty and an assassin going by the name Shurayuki-hime, blocks the path of several men and a rickshaw and kills them and their leader Shibayama using a sword concealed in the handle of an umbrella. Yuki appears in a poor village looking for a man called Matsuemon, the leader of an underground organization of street beggars, and asks him to find her mother's surviving tormentors in return for having killed Shibayama for him. Matsuemon's intel leads her to Takemura Banz≈ç, an alcoholic wreck with gambling debts whose daughter Kobue works as a prostitute to support him. After convincing the gambling house's owners to pardon Banz≈ç after he was caught cheating in a card game, Yuki leads him to the beach and remorselessly kills him after revealing her identity. Yuki then learns that the last of her mother's rapists, Tsukamoto Gishir≈ç, had suspiciously died in a ship wreck three years prior when she first attempted to find him. After attacking Gishir≈ç's tombstone in frustration, Yuki finds herself being followed by a reporter named Ry≈´rei Ashio. She warns him to stay away from her. Ashio learned of Yuki's story from D≈çkai who persuaded him to publish it as a means to draw out one of Sayo's tormentors, and the man who murdered Shiro: Kitahama Okono. Okono sends men to kidnap Ashio, threatening him with torture for Yuki's location, but Ashio refuses to tell. Yuki enters Okono's estate and kills several of Okono's men while pursuing Okono. Yuki and Ry≈´rei find Okono's dying body hanging within a room. Yuki slices Okono in half. Ashio tells Yuki that Gishir≈ç is his father, and had faked his death when he learned of Yuki's mission.

At one point, a special effect blood spatter went wrong, covering Meiko Kaji in fake blood. Release and reception Lady Snowblood was released in Japan on December 1, 1973, where it was distributed by Toho. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 100% based on seven reviews, with an average rating of 8.05/10. TV Guide gave the film three-out-of-five stars, calling it \\"certainly entertaining, but unnecessarily distancing\\". Sequel and influence The film spawned a sequel, Lady Snowblood: Love Song of Vengeance, released in 1974. Another adaptation of the original manga, titled The Princess Blade, was released in 2001. Lady Snowblood was a major inspiration for Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill. According to Meiko Kaji, Tarantino made the cast and crew of Kill Bill watch DVDs of Lady Snowblood during filming breaks. The music video for \\"rockstar\\" by Post Malone featuring 21 Savage, references scenes from Lady Snowblood. Additionally a 1977 Hong Kong martial arts film Broken Oath directed by Jeong Chang-hwa and starring Angela Mao in the leading role is also an unofficial remake of Lady Snowblood. Home media Lady Snowblood was released on VHS in 1997, and was later released on DVD by AnimEigo in 2004. In 2012, the film was released in a box set with Lady Snowblood 2: Love Song of Vengeance on Blu-ray and DVD by Arrow Video. In January 2016, the film was again released with Love Song of Vengeance on Blu-ray and DVD by the Criterion Collection.

Note that the person acting as Prime Minister does not do so on a permanent basis: if a Prime Minister dies, resigns or loses a vote of confidence in the Riksdag, the Speaker of the Riksdag will then confer with the parties of the Riksdag and propose a new Prime Minister, who must be tolerated by a majority of the Riksdag. If the Prime Minister has resigned or lost a vote of confidence, he or she will remain the head of a government ad interim until the new Prime Minister assumes his or her office. The only case where the governmental line of succession becomes relevant is when the Prime Minister dies (upon which the person next in the line of succession serves as the head of a government ad interim) or when the Prime Minister is on leave or for any other reason incapable of serving, but still remains in office.

The magazine reports on Canada and international military issues, politics, military history and current events. Esprit de Corps was originally designed to be an in-flight reading magazine in 1988 for passengers on Canadian Forces aircraft. Each issue features \\"On Target\\", an article written by Scott Taylor about current events. The magazine features a letter to the editor section where readers may comment on earlier issues, as well as a \\"hit and miss\\" page of short articles on current events. The magazine also features sections on military history such as \\"The Fight for Canada\\" and Les Peate's \\"The Old Guard.\\" Esprit de Corps boasts such influential subscribers as former Chief of Defence Staff General Rick Hillier, former Minister of National Defence Gordon O'Connor, Chief of the Land Staff Lieutenant-General Andrew Leslie, former Air Command Lieutenant-General Steve Lucas and Canadian Senator Colin Kenny. History Esprit de Corps was first created in 1988 by Scott Taylor and his wife Katherine Taylor. The idea for the magazine began during a flight from Canadian Forces Base Lahr (CFB) to Germany, when the couple noted that Canadian Air Force planes lacked any on-board entertainment system or reading material. Scott and Katherine Taylor submitted their proposal ‚Äî which was eventually accepted ‚Äî to create an in-flight magazine for the Canadian Forces five passenger aircraft. In the premi√®re issue of Esprit de Corps, Taylor explained the purpose of the publication: \\"By focusing on the past and present accomplishments of the Canadian Forces, it is our aim to contribute to the 'esprit de corps' that has made the Canadian military one of the finest professional armed forces in the world today.\\" The content began as a bilingual seatback magazine, designed with many illustrations and small articles that provided entertainment and reading for the aircraft passengers. Due to the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Canadian government's subsequent downsizing of its military expenditures, the Canadian Forces were experiencing budget cuts and changing the way in which their personnel would be transported. This affected Esprit de Corps drastically, as Canadian Forces personnel would now be transported on flights chartered by Air Canada. Because of the loss of its Canadian Air Force distribution and the cost-cutting atmosphere of the military community, the Taylors decided to convert their magazine to a newsstand monthly. The new magazine would feature mainly current military news and Canadian military history. The magazine continued to retain its seat-back distribution with Air Canada military charters and Scott Taylor began to hire staff to help fill their new eighty-four page format. In 1991, Esprit de Corps ran a controversial article, in which Scott Taylor stated that, \\"With the appointment of Marcel Masse as Defence Minister and the subsequent announcement of pending base closures, personnel cutbacks and procurement delays, it would appear that the Canadian military is forever destined to win wars on foreign soil and lose battles on Parliament Hill.\\" The issue also featured an exclusive interview with Vice-Admiral Charles Thomas, who that April had resigned as vice-chief of defence staff over policy differences with the government. The Department of National Defence had taken the unusual step of releasing Thomas' letter of resignation along with a response from Chief of Defence Staff John de Chastelain attacking Thomas' motives rather than addressing his concerns about the direction of the Canadian Forces. Not long after publication, Air Canada, which now handled the Canadian Forces' charter flights, informed the magazine that \\"due to concerns over editorial content\\" it would no longer be welcome on board, on orders from the Department of National Defence. Esprit de Corps went to the media with the story of censorship and threatened to issue a press release detailing corruption involving the DND official magazine Canadian Defence Quarterly. The DND‚Äôs decision was reversed and Esprit de Corps was quickly reinstated on the flights. Disputes with the Department of National Defence  =1993 cover up of Daniel Gunther's death= In 1993, Esprit de Corps with the help of Sun Media, reported on Department of National Defence (DND) fabrications regarding the death of Cpl. Daniel Gunther during Operation Medak Pocket in the Croatian War of Independence. DND reported that Gunther had died of injuries received when a mortar shell landed near his APC, characterizing the death as closer to an accident or misadventure than a deliberate murder, despite clear information available in the original report that showed he had been hit in the chest with a rocket-propelled grenade. The reaction from the DND to this expos√© was swift, as the magazine was once again banned from the Canadian Forces flights. This time, the eviction was permanent and Esprit de Corps was abruptly granted its full independence. =February 1994 abuse of Canadian peacekeepers= Scott Taylor aggressively challenged yet another cover-up by the DND in his February 1994 letter from the publisher. The capture and abuse, including mock executions of 11 Canadian peacekeepers at the hands of drunken Serbian soldiers remained unreported by DND until it was discovered by The New York Times. =July 1994 Shidane Arone \\"Scapegoat\\" article= The issue featured a three-page interview with Lieutenant-General Gordon Reay, commander of the army. The July 1994 issue marked Esprit de Corps' strongest editorial statement to date. The cover depicted Trooper Kyle Brown, who had been sentenced to five years in the death of Shidane Arone in Somalia. The headline: \\"Scapegoat\\". Inside were pages of analysis of how the media had been manipulated throughout the Somalia incident, the political background of the scandal and reminders that Brown, who had written to Esprit de Corps in an attempt to explain his side of the story, had been under orders to \\"abuse\\" prisoners and had himself been the one to inform his superiors about the murder of Arone. =Misuse of funds for public affairs branch= Esprit de Corps uncovered the misuse of $19, 503, 46 for regimental items for the public affairs branch, a personal expense improperly authorized by Major Robert Butt. The story \\"Exposing Major Butt\\" would not be the last update on the saga, nor the last of the increasingly off-colour puns with which they would be headlined. Esprit de Corps Books publishing Since the mid-1990s, Esprit de Corps' investigations of the Canadian military, both its proud history and its current challenges, have laid the foundation for 14 books, with Canadian publishers and the in-house Esprit de Corps Books imprint. Some of these books have been translated into Serbian, Macedonian, and Japanese. =Tested Mettle: Canada's Peacekeepers (1998)= The debut publication from Esprit de Corps Books, Tested Mettle was intended to be the companion piece to Scott Taylor's Tarnished Brass: Crime and Corruption in the Canadian Military but was unable to secure a publisher. Tested Mettle exposed new failures in military leadership, including the bureaucratic confiscation of a wounded soldier‚Äôs wheelchair and reservists losing their pay as soon as they were hospitalized with injuries. =INAT: Images of Serbia and the Kosovo Conflict (2000)= INAT is a story of the NATO air raids during the Serbia and Kosovo conflict; Scott Taylor was a spectator there. For 25 days in May and June 1999, Taylor reported on the NATO air campaign from inside Yugoslavia as one of the few western journalists to be granted access. During his time, he was able to get a unique perspective on the conflict: that of the Serbian‚Äôs perspective. =Diary of an Uncivil War: The Violent Aftermath of the Kosovo Conflict (2002) = Diary of an Uncivil War is the story of Kosovo as written by Taylor, consisting primarily of his first-hand observations and interviews with the people and players involved in the aftermath of the Kosovo conflict. It is a personal account of the war and its aftermath in Serbia and Macedonia. =Spinning on the Axis of Evil: America's War against Iraq (2003)= Spinning on the Axis of Evil was based on Taylor's personal experiences and observations from 14 trips into Iraq before and after the toppling of Saddam's regime. This book provides insight into the Iraqi civilians who suffered during the wars in Iraq, as well as the sanctions imposed on the country. =Among the 'Others': the Forgotten Turkmen of Iraq (2004)= In Among the 'Others' Taylor investigates the often unheard of Turkmen population of Iraq, who have been repressed by several Iraq regimes. Taylor offers his personal observations of the Turkmen who have suffered from political oppression and ethnic violence. The book also details Scott Taylor's kidnapping in northern Iraq by Ansar al-Islam militants. =Unreconciled Differences: Turkey, Armenia and Azerbaijan (2010)= In Unreconciled Differences, Taylor explains the current differences between Armenians and Turks, and Armenians and Azerbaijanis. Having visited these regions several times and spoken at length to their populations, Taylor sheds light on the events of 1915 in the Ottoman Empire and 1988-1994 in Azerbaijan. The book explores the regional conflicts of these countries and how they remained unresolved to this day. =Canada's Secret Commandos (2002)= Canada's Secret Commandos is an expos√© of the JTF2 secret military unit, written by Ottawa Citizen's award winning defence correspondent David Pugliese. It contains dozens of interviews and analysis of previously classified government documents, each piecing together the story of Canada's most secretive military unit. Canada's Secret Commandos is one of the most significant coverings of the unit to date and is even acknowledged as such by the JTF2. =Battles without Borders: The Rise and Fall of New France (2005)= Far from a peaceful kingdom of legend inhabited by an unmilitary people, Canada has been shaped by war. Not only has war made possible Canada's very existence, it has shaped its myths and memories and defined the national identity. Bill Twatio chronicles the history of Canada from the first skirmishes between the Vikings and the Dorset peoples, through the final fall of New France. =Sacrifice and Suffering (2006)= Sacrifice and Suffering is a book edited by Kerkuk Turkmenoolu, with a foreword by Scott Taylor, that explains the struggles and problems of the Turkmen peoples of Iraq. =Shadow Wars (2003)= Shadow Wars by David Pugliese is an expanded research on special forces units around the world and the critical, often secretive, role they have had in the recent wars involving the United States. =Uneasy Neighbours: Conflicts that Defined Canada (2005)= Uneasy Neighbours is a historical analysis by Bill Twatio, in which he chronicles Canada's military history by looking at the country's fragile relationship with the United States of America, from the American Revolution and the War of 1812, to the rebellions in Upper and Lower Canada, the U.S Civil War and the Fenian Raids. Uneasy Neighbours describes the often tumultuous relationship between Canada and the United States. =The War That Wasn't: Canadians in Korea (2005)= The War That Wasn't written by Les Peate explains the unpleasant and dangerous Korean War and describes the almost 27,000 Canadians who fought in it. It contains the stories of the Canadians and their allies who served in the Korean theatre between 1950 and 1953. =From Baddeck to the Yalu (2005)= Albert Prince was killed in action five days before his country declared war in 1939. Hammy Gray was shot down in a daring attack six days before the end of the Pacific War in 1945. That afternoon Lt. Gerald Anderson of Trenton died trying to land a crippled aircraft on Gray's carrier. An air gunner in WWII, Norm Shannon's interest in the role of Canadians in aerial warfare has culminated in this personal look at the impressive place they hold in military aviation history. 2005 redesign In March 2005, Esprit de Corps changed its format to coincide with the changes occurring to Canada's military. The magazine was redesigned and revamped with a new logo, more colour, commentary and a higher page count. New regular features were added such as \\"Hits and Misses\\", \\"At Ease\\" and the humour and trivia section.

Many of the Hollywood studios produced such films during the war, generally musicals, frequently with flimsy storylines, and with the specific intent of entertaining the troops overseas and civilians back home and to encourage fundraising - as well as to show the studios' patriotism. This film was also the first released by Paramount to be shown for 8 weeks. Star Spangled Rhythm was directed by George Marshall and others,TCM Full credits and written by Harry Tugend with sketches by Melvin Frank, George S. Kaufman and others. The film has music by Robert Emmett Dolan and songs by Harold Arlen and Johnny Mercer, and the cast consisted of most of the stars on the Paramount roster. Plot Pop Webster is a former silent movie star once known as \\"Bronco Billy\\" who now works as the guard on the main gate at Paramount Pictures. However, he's told his son Johnny, who's in the Navy, that he's the studio's Executive Vice President in Charge of Production. When Johnny shows up in Hollywood on shore leave, Pop and the studio's switchboard operator, Polly Judson, go all-out to maintain the illusion for Johnny and his sailor friends that Pop's a studio big-wig. Things get a bit complicated when Pop offers to put on a variety show for the Navy, featuring all of Paramount's stars, but Polly convinces Bob Hope and Bing Crosby to do the show, and they convince the rest of the stars on the lot.Erickson, Hal Plot synopsis (Allmovie)TCM Full synopsis Cast Performers: Cast notes: *The character \\"B.G. Desoto\\" is modeled after Paramount executive producer Buddy DeSylva, and \\"Y. Frank Freemont\\" after vice-president Y. Frank Freeman. When pretending to be \\"Mr Freemont\\"'s secretary, Betty Hutton speaks in an affected Southern accent; the real Y. Frank Freeman was a Southerner who was intensely loyal to Dixie. *Others who appear in the film include Rod Cameron, Eva Gabor, Cecil Kellaway, Matt McHugh, Robert Preston and Woody Strode. Strode is seen only very briefly as Eddie Anderson's chauffeur in the \\"Sharp As a Tack\\" number. *Star Spangled Rhythm marked the feature film debut of Bing Crosby's son, Gary Crosby, who was 9 years old at the time. * Although \\"Benito Mussolini\\", \\"Hirohito\\" and \\"Adolf Hitler\\" are listed as characters in this film, the actors cast in those roles are not actually portraying the dictators themselves; they are merely impersonators showing up for a brief sight gag at the end of the novelty number \\"A Sweater, a Sarong and a Peekaboo Bang\\". Tom Dugan, a veteran character actor who appeared as \\"Adolf Hitler\\", also played \\"Bronski\\", an actor who plays the part of \\"Adolf Hitler\\", in Ernst Lubitsch's classic comedy To Be or Not To Be.TCM Notes Songs The songs in Star Spangled Rhythm were written by Harold Arlen (music) and Johnny Mercer (lyrics):TCM Music *\\"Hit the Road to Dreamland\\" - sung by Mary Martin, Dick Powell and the Golden Gate Quartette *\\"I'm Doing It for Defense\\" - sung by Betty Hutton *\\"Old Glory\\" - sung by Bing Crosby and chorus *\\"He Loved Me Till the All-Clear Came\\" *\\"On the Swing Shift\\" - sung and danced by Marjorie Reynolds, Betty Jane Rhodes and Dona Drake *\\"Sharp as a Tack\\" - sung by Eddie \\"Rochester\\" Anderson, Katherine Dunham, Slim Gaillard and Slam Stewart, and Woody Strode *\\"A Sweater, Sarong and a Peek-A-Boo Bang\\" - sung by Paulette Goddard, Dorothy Lamour, and Veronica Lake (dubbed by Martha Mears), and by Arthur Treacher, Walter Catlett and Sterling Holloway, in drag *\\"That Old Black Magic\\" - sung by Johnny Johnston and danced by Vera ZorinaMotion Picture Production Encyclopedia - Page 789 1952 Best Original Song : \\"Black Magic,\\" from \\"Star Spangled Rhythm,\\" Paramount Production The working title of Star Spangled Rhythm was Thumbs Up. Paramount paid Arthur Ross and Fred Saidy for the rights to two sketches from their musical revue Rally Round the Girls, which were used in the film. The \\"That Old Black Magic\\" sequence, which was directed by A. Edward Sutherland, was intended to be directed by Ren√© Clair, who was unavailable at the time of shooting. The film was in production from 11 June to 23 July 1942TCM Overview at Paramount's studios on Melrose Avenue in Hollywood. Location shooting took place at the Naval Training Center in San Diego, California.IMDB Filming locations The final cost of the film was $1,127,989. The film premiered in New York City on December 30, 1942 and went into general release in February 1943. In 1943, Broncho Billy Anderson (real name:Maxwell Henry Aronson) sued Paramount for using the \\"Broncho Billy\\" name without permission. He objected to the \\"Bronco Billy\\" character in Star Spangled Rhythm being a \\"washed-up and broken-down actor\\", which he felt reflected badly on himself. Aronson asked for $900,000, but the outcome of the lawsuit is unknown. Veronica Lake and Alan Ladd both appear - and they would team in two other all star films. Awards and honors Star Spangled Rhythm received two 1944 Academy Award nominations: Harold Arlen (music) and Johnny Mercer (lyrics) were nominated for \\"Best Original Song\\" for \\"That Old Black Magic\\", and Robert Emmett Dolan was nominated for \\"Best Score\\".IMDB Awards The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2006: AFI's Greatest Movie Musicals ‚Äì Nominated See also * This Is the Army * Hollywood Canteen * Thousands Cheer * Stage Door Canteen * Thank Your Lucky Stars * Private Buckaroo References External links  * * Category:1942 musical films Category:1942 films Category:American films Category:American black-and- white films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by George Marshall Category:Paramount Pictures films Category:American musical films ","title":"Star Spangled Rhythm"},{"id":"9442758","text":"Take No Prisoners is an action video game released in 1997, developed by Raven Software. Plot The game is set in San Antonio, Texas, in a post- apocalyptic near-future. The player takes the role of Slade, a mercenary recruited by Martech Industries, Inc. to retrieve a crystal located in the Dome, in the center of the desolated city, which protects those within from the harmful radiation consuming the planet. He must make his way through a chaotic San Antonio and fight military, civilian and security forces combined with irradiated mutants to reach the Dome and retrieve the crystal. This is intended to create a new Dome, and how it is used results in one of two different endings. The end of the game also suggests a sequel, but it was never released. Gameplay The game is a top-down shooter with a wide selection of weapons and gadgets to use to solve puzzles and kill enemies. Levels are typically large and sprawling and with multiple points of entry and exit. The city is divided into seven sectors, each one ruled by particular factions, all hostile, with a total of 18 individual levels. Each faction has a critical piece of technology that allows Slade to infiltrate the dome and steal the crystal that powers it. Levels can be moved between by train, truck and boat, and each form of transport begins the next level from a different entry point. Progress is non-linear with the player able to pursue the goal in any order they wish, returning to levels with new weapons and technology. Some areas of levels are only accessible from specific entrances and most levels are designed to be returned to once the player is better equipped. There are a variety of vehicles that the player can use including air boats, hover craft and buggies for traversing the large, sprawling levels. The story is told in a non-linear style using dropped or downloaded logs that the player can discover in any order. As the story progresses it becomes clear that Slade is not the only person dispatched on his mission and the player encounters other heavily armed mercenaries sent by his employer. Many puzzles in the game are hinted at through the dropped logs. Some levels in the game contain terrain that can be destroyed to allow access to secret areas or shortcuts through the level. Weapons in the game range from shotguns and assault rifles to high-tech gaussian guns and plasma rifles. Gadgets available include cloaking devices, hover boards and implosion grenades. Some weapons or gadgets are upgradeable. The medkit can be upgraded several times, allowing the player to carry substantially more health and increasing their durability, allowing them to stand up to much more powerful enemies. The medkit automatically heals the player when they would take lethal damage, so it serves as a secondary health pool. At maximum level the player can carry over four thousand health points in their medkit, vastly improving their survivability. While the overall goal is simply to kill each faction leader and take their respective gadget, getting to that leader is often a puzzle that requires visiting every location in their territory and finding clues for puzzles and equipment to overcome obstacles. Finding the routes between levels is a large part of progressing, as many levels can only be accessed from specific locations and forms of transport. The game encourages players to keep their own notes as there is no direct map of transport routes available, so learning the route to specific locations is very important. Once the player has explored the whole zone and acquired all the critical gadgets, they must infiltrate the dome, kill its guardian and steal the dome crystal, which requires use of all seven stolen technologies. Development Take No Prisoners was Raven Software's first game to not use a first-person perspective. Producer Steve Schreck explained, \\"We all love playing first-person games. But the great thing about a top-down perspective is the ability to convey a realistic sense of people surrounding you or converging upon you, and that's really what this game is about.\\" Reception GamePro gave Take No Prisoners credit for \\"a deep story line and tons of keyboard commands, tasks to accomplish, and areas to explore\\", but opined that the game world is frustrating and tedious to navigate due to its complexity, unappealing graphics, and \\"chintzy sound.\\" The reviewer also contended that \\"overhead angles for action games simply don't work.\\" GameSpot instead considered the overhead perspective \\"a breath of fresh air\\" among the deluge of first-person action games coming out at the time. They praised the presentation of the story through found log entries, the engaging puzzles, and the moody graphics, and remarked that while the game had its share of flaws, such as sluggish net play and a lack of wit in the player character's one- liners, it was overall different enough to be worth getting. They gave it a 7 out of 10.

It is said that Napoleon's soldiers carved their initials in these trees. The Haarlemmerhout is the oldest public park of the Netherlands. It lies on the south side of Haarlem, on the same old sandy sea wall that is shared by the public park Haagse Bos in The Hague and the Alkmaarderhout in Alkmaar. History Early map of Haarlem from 1560 showing the Haarlemmer Hout much as it is today On a map drawn in 1560 of Haarlem, the Haarlemmerhout is shown in the characteristic form that it has today. It was burned by the Spaniards during the siege of Haarlem, but replanted. The east- west road at the southern edge of the park still exists and is called the Spanjaardslaan (Spaniard's lane) in memory of this event. Across the centuries, various landscape artists have made new plans for this wood. But the long vista through the eastern portion of the park designed in 1760 by Jan van Vorel exists up to this day, affording a view of the government building villa Welgelegen. Though several parks in the Netherlands date from medieval times, the Haarlemmerhout is special because it was never locked by a gate, and when the park was redesigned in 1760, it was planted in the fashionable English style with a view for public access. Though in earlier centuries the park served as a common ground for farm animals and fire kindling, the redesigned park came to be used as a place for recreation in the sense currently given to public parks today. Though today all of the park lies within the city limits of Haarlem, the Southern end of the park was in Heemstede until this land was annexed by Haarlem in 1927. Heemstede did not charge taxes on drinking bier and wine in public taverns, and for this reason drinking in Heemstede taverns in the park was very popular and even caused an argument between the Haarlem city council and the Heemstede city council that escalated to the high court of Mechelen and had to be resolved in 1539 with a special map by Simon Meeuszoon.The oldest map of Haarlem on display in the North Holland archives, in 1539 by Simon Meeuszoon, made to resolve a border conflict between Haarlem and Heemstede and served the lawsuit in the Grote Raad van Mechelen. The Grote Raad was the highest court at that time. At the time the economy of Haarlem was depressed, so the need for extra income was high.

Description The yellowtail barracuda has an elongated body with two well separated dorsal fins, the anterior dorsal fin has five spines with the first spine being the longest. The origin of the second dorsal fin is positioned slightly in front of that of the anal fin. The pelvic fin is located below the tip of the pectoral fin, which in turn is positioned in front of the origin of the anterior dorsal fin. The large head is slightly flattened towards the rear and bears a large eye, pointed snout and long jaws, with a prognathic lower jaw. In the front of the upper jaw there are several fang-like teeth, then 4-5 sharp teeth which form a single row on the palatine followed by a single row of smaller teeth on premaxilla. The lower jaw has a single large canine-like tooth at its apex followed by a row of smaller sharp teeth along the each side of the jaw. It is grey in colour on the back with a countershaded pattern of a white underside, sometimes the flanks show a yellow tint. The tail is yellow with black margins. They can grow to 60 cm but 35‚Äì40 cm is normal. Distribution The yellowtail barracuda is found from the Red Sea east through the Indian and Pacific Oceans to Samoa, its northern limit is the Ryukyu Islands and its southern is on the Great Barrier Reef. It was first recorded in the Mediterranean off Israel in 1992 and had reached the island of Rhodes by 2002 and Libya by 2005. It is established but still relatively rare in the Mediterranean but its true status may be obscured by confusion with sympatric congeners, although both the yellowtail barracuda and Sphyraena chrysotaenia were found to be common off the coast of Libya. Biology Yellowtail barracudas school by day in lagoons, inner and outer reef slopes and is probably a nocturnal hunter of fish and large invertebrates. Their eggs and fry are planktonic while the juveniles shelter in very sheltered coastal waters. The adults attain a maximum age of six years old. In Australia the yellowtail barracuda was found to be a host to the parasitic tapeworm Floriceps minacanthus while the ectoparasitic monogenean Diplectanum cazauxi has been found on the gills of a number of barracuda species, including the yellowtail barracuda. Another known ectoparasite of the yellowtail barracuda is the copepod Caligus inopinatus.

Faris Khoury went on to become prime minister of Syria from October 14, 1944, to October 1, 1945, and from October 1954 to February 13, 1955. Faris Koury's position as prime minister is, as of 2017, the highest political position a Syrian Christian has ever reached. Khoury's electoral popularity was due in part to his staunch secularist and nationalist policies. As a die-hard Syrian nationalist, Khoury never compromised on his principles and was resolutely against pan-Arabism and the ill-fated union between Syria and Egypt. Khoury opposed the short-lived union between Nasser's Egypt and republican Syria, the United Arab Republic. Through it all Faris Khoury served his country for almost 50 years. He was the grandfather of noted Syrian novelist Colette Khoury. Early years Faris Khoury was born in Kfeir in the Hasbaya District in modern-day Lebanon to a Greek Orthodox Christian family that eventually converted to Presbyterianism. Faris studied at the American University of Beirut, at the time called Syrian Protestant College. He started his career as an instructor at AUB and became involved in al-Fatat, the leading anti-Ottoman movement, after its creation in Paris in 1911. Khoury became the Christian member of the Ottoman Parliament representing Damascus in 1908. In May 1916 Khoury agreed to assist Michel Sursock, a wartime profiteer, in requisitioning grain from farmers in the HawranFawaz, Leila Tarazi (2014) a land of aching hearts : the Middle East in the Great War Harvard University Press. . p.122 Also 1916, Khoury joined the Arab resistance and promised to support the Arab Revolt, launched from Mecca by Sharif Husayn. His connections with Husayn, the prime nationalist of his era, resulted in his arrest and trial by a military tribunal in Aley. After King Faisal's arrival and liberation of Syria, Khoury pledged allegiance to King Faisal, the newly proclaimed King of Syria, by the Syrian peoples. In September 18, 1918 Khoury created a preliminary government with a group of notables in Damascus, spearheaded by Prince Sa‚Äôid al-Jaza‚Äôiri. Khoury then became minister of Finance in the new Syrian cabinet of Prime Minister Rida Pasha al-Rikabi. His post was renewed by Prime Minister Hashim al-Atassi in May 1920. He held this position until King Faisal was dethroned and the French Colonial forces imposed their mandate on Syria in July 1920. Khoury laid the groundwork for the Syrian Ministry of Finance, created its infrastructure, distributed its administrative duties, formulated its laws, and handpicked its staff. In 1923, he helped found Damascus University and along with a group of veteran educators, translated its entire curriculum from Ottoman Turkish into Arabic. Later years In 1925 Khoury joined Abd al-Rahman Shahbandar to found the People's Party, of which he became vice-president. Minister of Education from April to July 1926, he was elected member of the Syrian Constituent Assembly in 1928, then elected to the Syrian Parliament in 1932, reelected in 1936 (and president of the Parliament till 1939) and 1943 (and again president of the Parliament till 1944). He was a member of the Syrian delegation that negotiated the Franco-Syrian Treaty in Paris in 1936. Foundation of the UN Faris Khoury was the first Syrian statesman to visit the United States and represent his country in 1945 at the inauguration of the UN. Syria was one of the original 53 founding members of the United Nations. As the head of Syria's delegation in San Francisco, Faris al-Khoury's superb oratory and astuteness made a strong impression in front of world leaders. After hearing Khoury's eloquent speech, a US diplomat remarked: \\"It is impossible for a country with men like these, to be occupied!\\" One of the amazing stories of the history of the United Nations is when Faris Al-Khoury sat on France's chair instead of Syria's, After a few minutes, the French representative to the UN approached Faris and asked him to leave the chair, Faris ignored the Frenchman and just looked at his watch, a couple of minutes later, the Frenchman angrily asked Faris to leave immediately, but Faris kept on ignoring the Frenchman and just staring at his watch, After 25 minutes of sitting in France's chair, Faris left the chair and said to the French representative: \\"You could not bear watching me sitting in your chair for a mere 25 minutes, Your country has occupied mine for more than 25 years, hasn't the time of your troops departure come yet?\\". It is worth noting that the process of Syria's independence started in this same UN session. Political career He became Prime Minister from October 14, 1944 till October 1, 1945, then again president of the parliament till the military coup of Husni al-Za'im who dissolved it in April 1949. After free elections in October 1954, he returned as Prime Minister from October 25, 1954 till February 13, 1955 when his pro-Western government, hostile to a union with Egypt, was toppled by the parliament. Death In his old age, Faris al-Khury spent more time with his wife, child, and three grandchildren, Faris Jr, Colette, and Samer. He continued to travel to attend annual law conventions in Switzerland, until he fractured his leg and was forced to stay at home for the final two years of his life. On January 2, 1962, the former Syrian prime minister died in Damascus, at the age of 85, ending a career that spanned over 50-years in Syria‚Äôs political sphere. He received presidential honors at his funeral as one of the founders of the Syrian Republic, unlike any prime minister before or after him. Making a statement even in death, Muslim community leaders were allowed to recite the Quran during the condolence service. Suheil al-Khury accepted this rare act to show how secular his father had been, and how close he had been to both Muslims and Christians. Faris al-Khoury's death came three months after the dissolution of the United Arab Republic between Egypt and Syria (1958‚Äì1961) during which he was an active political opponent. Legal opinions As a typical Syrian nationalist, he considered the territorial transfer of Hatay Province to Turkey by decision of the French government as illegal under international law.Yearbook of the ILC, 1950, vol. 1. p. 77 For that reason, he also opposed the proposal to declare every unprovoked invasion by armed gangs of another country as criminal under international law, claiming that such gangs often served interests of national liberation of certain territories.Yearbook of the ILC, 1950, vol. 1, pp. 119, 169 However, he considered the refusal of governments parties to a dispute to submit to UN Security Council resolutions as an international crime.Yearbook of the ILC, 1950, vol. 1, p. 168 References Category:1877 births Category:1962 deaths Category:People from Hasbaya Category:Syrian people of Lebanese descent Category:Syrian Christians Category:Syrian nationalists Category:Syrian secularists Category:Prime Ministers of Syria Category:20th-century Syrian politicians Category:Arabs of the Ottoman Empire Category:American University of Beirut alumni Category:Syrian ministers of finance Category:Syrian ministers of education Category:Speakers of the People's Council of Syria Category:Permanent Representatives of Syria to the United Nations Category:National Bloc (Syria) politicians Category:People's Party (Syria) politicians Category:Critics of Arab nationalism ","title":"Fares al-Khoury"},{"id":"9442835","text":"Marshal Kim Yong-chun (4 March 1936 ‚Äì 16 August 2018) was a North Korean soldier and politician.

He began his professional career as an artist, constantly entering competitions, exhibiting, and later permanent exhibitions in the town. He developed and matured distinctive styles, seeking the company of regional artists and accepting criticism. He spent most of his life as an artist, painting under the name of \\"Raymond de Longueuil\\", capturing the final years of traditional farming in the Bearn. His subjects ranged from the figurative, through still life and landscape to the abstract, and he had a constant need to develop and experiment. A deeply religious man, he was almost reclusive and fanatical about his creativity - characteristics which flowed into his art, diaries, and poetry. This was not a life of privilege but of challenge. From both outside and inside, he was obsessed by creativity. Elements from his deep faith were frequently reflected in subtle motifs. Prior to his death in 2004, he had been working until two days before on a woodland scene, sketched out on his easel in his bedroom. Next to this was his light- box and an outline for a monoprint of The Shepherd leading his flock through mountains.\\"Biography of R. de Longueuil\\" (website) http://www.delongueuil.com/bioganglais.htm accessed August 20, 2010Rachel Grant biography at: Legacy He died in Navarrenx, France in 2004.\\"Biography of R. de Longueuil\\" (website) http://www.delongueuil.com/bioganglais.htm accessed August 20, 2010 The Institute Raymond de Longueuil opened in Navarrenx in 2007.

The Jewish community numbered 66,000 on the eve of the Second World War but, after the war and the Holocaust, is now less than half that number. Today, Belgium is home to more than 30,000 Jews, of whom two-thirds live in Antwerp. History Jews being burned at the stake. Miniature from a 14th-century manuscript =Early history= Great Synagogue, Brussels The first Jews to arrive in the present- day territory of Belgium arrived with the Romans between the years 50 and 60 AD. Jews were mentioned in the Middle Ages in Brabant, and in 1261 Duke Henry III ordered the expulsion of Jews and usurers from the province. The Jewish community suffered further during the Crusades, as many Jews who refused to be baptised were put to death. This early community mostly disappeared after the Black Death persecutions 1348‚Äì1350, and finally the Brussels massacre, 1370.Au nom de l'antisionisme: l'image des Juifs et d'Isra√´l dans la ... p27 Jo√´l Kotek, Dan Kotek - 2005 \\"Des √©meutes antijuives s'ensuivent.

En 1370, une vingtaine de Juifs sont br√ªl√©s √† Bruxelles.\\" =Sephardim= In the 16th century, many Sephardic Jews who had been expelled from Spain and Portugal settled in Belgium and the Netherlands. In addition, many Marranos (crypto-Jews who outwardly professed Christianity) settled in Antwerp at the end of the 15th century. =Later history= Austrian (Habsburg) rule in Belgium started in 1713. Particularly under Emperor Joseph II, Jews acquired more rights, such as those to practice crafts, own land, and operate their own cemeteries. A number of Ashkenazi Jews immigrated to the area in that period. The status of Jews in Belgium improved further under French and Dutch rule. Shortly following Belgian independence in 1830, Judaism was given the status of an officially recognized religion (besides Roman Catholicism, the majority faith of the country, and Protestantism). On 17 March 1832 the Central Jewish Consistory of Belgium was founded as the official representative of the Jewish religion to the Belgian authorities. The Great Synagogue of Brussels was built in 1876‚Äì1877. Around the turn of the century, the focal point of the world's diamond trade shifted from Amsterdam to Antwerp, bringing many Jewish diamond traders and polishers to the city. During World War I, many fled to the neutral Netherlands, but they returned after the war. Many Polish and Romanian Jews immigrated during the 1920s while Nazi persecutions brought waves of German and Austrian Jews in the 1930s. =Holocaust= National Monument to the Jewish Martyrs of Belgium, in Brussels Memorial to Belgian Jews in Neve Ilan forest Prior to the Second World War, and its peak, the Jewish community of Belgium consisted of roughly 70,000 Jews (35,000 resided in Antwerp and 25,000 in Brussels). About 22,000 Jews at that time were German Jewish refugees. Only 6% of the Jewish population were of Belgian nationality. Belgium was occupied by Nazi Germany between May 1940 and September 1944, and anti-Semitic policies were adopted throughout Belgium, even though popular resistance in some cities hindered their full application. Belgian local police rounded up Jews, on three occasions in Antwerp, assisting the German in fulfilling their murderous policy towards the Jews. Approximately 45% of the Belgian Jews (25.484 people) were deported to concentration camps from Dossin Barracks in Mechelen, primarily to Auschwitz. Only 1,200 of the deportees survived the war. The Committee for Jewish Defence, which worked with the national resistance movement Front de l'Ind√©pendance, was the largest Jewish defence movement in Belgium during the war. Some Belgian Jews who fled Belgium in 1940 were deported on transports from Drancy, France. A total of 28,900 Belgian Jews perished between 1942 and 1945. Belgium was the only occupied country in which a transport (Train XX) was halted to give deportees a chance to escape. Belgium ID card for a foreign Jewish woman used in Vichy France. The National Monument to the Jewish Martyrs of Belgium is in Brussels. More than twenty thousand names of Belgian Jewish victims are inscribed on the walls of the Monument, some of whom were killed on Belgian territory, but many of whom were shipped off to the death camps and executed in the East. Today Angela Merkel and Moscow Chief Rabbi Pinchas Goldschmidt in the Great Synagogue of Brussels, 2016 Today, there are around 42,000 Jews in Belgium. The Jewish Community of Antwerp (about 20,000 people) is one of the largest single communities in Europe, and one of the last places in the world where Yiddish is its primary language (mirroring certain Orthodox and Hassidic communities in New York and Israel). In addition a very high percentage (95%) of Jewish children in Antwerp receive a Jewish education. In contemporary Belgium, five Jewish newspapers and more than 45 active synagogues exist, 30 of which are in Antwerp. =Antisemitic incidents= According to JTAhttp://www.jta.org/ report, the number of antisemitic incidents in 2012 was the highest since 2009. 80 antisemitic incidents were reported throughout Belgium in 2012, a 23% increase from 2011 and an overall increase of 34% since 2000. Five of the incidents involved physical attacks, three of which occurred in Antwerp. In October 2013, Isi Leibler, the former president of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, reported on the alarming increase in the levels of antisemitism in Belgium. Leibler described a wide use of antisemitic caricatures in the media including a caricature on the official central Flanders educational website, comparing Israel to Nazi Germany. In addition, he described an increase of 30% in the number of antisemitic incidents including physical assaults and vandalism of Jewish institutions. Furthermore, according to a survey conducted among eight Jewish communities in eight European Union countries, 88% of Belgian Jews feel that in the course of recent years, antisemitism has intensified in their country. 10% of the Belgian survey respondents reported suffering from incidents of physical violence or threats due to their Jewish affiliation since 2008. Most of the victims did not report the incidents to the police. The increased frequency of antisemitic attacks started in May 2014, when four people were killed in a shooting at the Belgian Jewish Museum in Brussels. Two days later, a young Muslim man entered the CCU (Jewish Cultural Center) while an event was taking place and shouted racist slurs. A month later, a school bus in Antwerp, that was driving 5-year-old Jewish children was stoned by a group of Muslim teens. Towards the end of August 2014, a 75-year-old Jewish woman was hit and pushed to the ground because of her Jewish-sounding surname. The Coordination Forum for Countering Antisemitism reported six racist incidents, three of which tool place as a part of different demonstrations againstOperation Protective Edge in Gaza (July‚ÄìAugust 2014). Those demonstrations included antisemitic slurs such as \\"slaughter the Jews\\" and \\"Death to the Jews.\\" = Aalst annual carnival= Every year, the Flemish city of Aalst holds a three-day carnival attracting tens of thousands of people. In 2009, UNESCO added the carnival to its extended Intangible Cultural Heritage List.A Belgian parade may lose its place on UNESCO‚Äôs World Heritage List after it allowed an anti-Semitic float In March 2019, the carnival included a float that featured caricatures of large-nosed religious Jews with side curls standing next to bags of money, with one carrying a rat on its shoulder.Israel welcomes Belgian parade's removal from UNESCO list The float was widely condemned by major European Jewish groups and Belgium's Jewish community. UNESCO Removes Belgium Carnival With Antisemitic Float From Heritage List In a report to UNESCO following a complaint by the , Unia, the country's watchdog on racism, said the float was of a clearly antisemitic kind, but that no laws were breached. In the context of folklore, there was no intent to incite towards discrimination and then stereotypes are not illegal. After the city's mayor refused to ban a repeat of such displays, he asked UNESCO through a statement to regional TV Oost to strip the Aalst carnival of World Heritage status, which UNESCO did in December 2019, ‚Äúover recurring repetition of racist and antisemitic representations.‚Äù =Data and Analysis= A review study published in 2015 by the Institute for the Study of Global Antisemitism and Policy (ISGAP) revealed that in a survey conducted in Brussels, more than half of the Muslim origin respondents agreed with antisemitic statements, such as: \\"Jews want to dominate everything\\" and ‚ÄúJews incite to war and blame others‚Äù. The review, which analysed a few studies regarding antisemitism in Europe, found that the level of antisemitic attitudes is significantly higher among Muslims than among non-Muslims. An ADL (Anti-Defamation League) audit published in June 2015 revealed an increase in level of concern about violence against Jews in Belgium. In addition, 7% of the participants claimed that the number of Jews who died in the Holocaust has been greatly exaggerated by history. In a follow-up survey 53% of the respondents agreed with the state: \\"Violence against Jews is a symptom of deep anti-Jewish feelings among some people in my country\\". The ADL also conducted a research of anti-Jewish attitudes inside the Muslim population of Belgium. The results showed that 82% of Muslim Belgium agreed with the state \\"Jews have too much power in the business world\\", compared to 36% of the national population who agreed with it. In all eleven categories included in the research, the Muslim population reached higher levels of agreement with anti-Jewish stereotypes. On 2015 the Fundamental Rights Agency published its annual overview of data on antisemitism available in the European Union. The finding of the file presents a persistent increase in the number of antisemitic incidents in Belgium through the last ten years. Data of the Interfederal Centre for Equal Opportunities displayed in the file, shows that 130 Complaints of antisemitism were received during 2014, compared to 85 complaints in 2013. Furthermore, the number of incidents in each category has increased in 2014, compared with 2013. The ADL (Anti-Defamation League) published on 2016 an update for their \\"ADL Global 100\\",(An international survey conducted in 2013-2014 to measure antisemitic opinions in 100 countries around the world) that contained an update of the antisemitic attitudes toward Jews in Belgium. The findings showed a decrease in the percentage of the population harboring antisemitic attitudes (21% in 2015, compare to 27% in 2014). In addition, the survey shows that 46% of the respondents agree with the phrase \\"Jews are more loyal to Israel than to this country\\", and that 39% of the respondents agree with the phrase \\"Jews still talk too much about what happened to them in the Holocaust\\".

He was a strong party man, and was accustomed to express his opinions with a vigour which sometimes aroused the anger of his opponents, though his genial personality made him genuinely popular.\\" Military career On the outbreak of World War I, Lord Kitchener issued his famous call to arms: 'Your King and Country Need You'. The flood of volunteers soon overwhelmed the ability of the Army to process them, and many units like the famous 'Pals Battalions' were raised under the auspices of mayors and corporations of towns up and down the country. On 14 January 1915 the War Office (WO) authorised Hall and the Mayor of Camberwell to recruit a brigade of four batteries of the Royal Field Artillery (RFA), to be numbered CLVI (156th), popularly known as the Camberwell Gun Brigade. Hall was commissioned as a Temporary Major on 5 February 1915 and promoted to Temporary Lieutenant-Colonel on 17 April. The local response was so prompt that in March another brigade was raised, numbered CLXII (162nd). The WO was then told that there were still enough would-be recruits in the Camberwell neighbourhood to raise the whole artillery for an infantry division. At once, authority was given to recruit the two remaining RFA brigades, CLXVI (166th) and CLXVII (167th) Howitzer Brigade, the 126th Heavy Battery of the Royal Garrison Artillery, and the Divisional Ammunition Column (a total of 17 batteries) for the 33rd Division composed of Pals Battalions such as the Public Schools Battalions and the Sportsmen's Battalions. Hall himself was the first commanding officer of CLVI Bde. All the men came from Camberwell and Dulwich, and the units were complete by 1 June.Becke, pp. 31‚Äì9.Macartney-Filgate, pp. 1‚Äì2.Seton-Hutchinson, p. 3.Brian Green, 'Dulwich During World War I', Dulwich Society.The authorisations by the War Office were actually issued on 3 February (156th), 2 March (167th) and 17 April (remainder): War Office Instructions July 1915, Appendix VI.London Gazette 12 March 1915.London Gazette 16 April 1915. 33rd (Camberwell) Divisional Artillery embarked at Southampton for France on 12‚Äì13 December 1915 and fought on the Western Front for the rest of the war. As the units he had raised began to move into the line, Lt-Col Hall handed over command of CLVI Bde to a permanent officer and returned to Parliament. He was later awarded a Distinguished Service Order (DSO) and knighted (KBE) in the 1918 New Year Honours for his efforts.Macartney-Filgate, pp. 7‚Äì11.London Gazette, 28 December 1917.London Gazette, 7 January 1918. After the war he was appointed (on 23 May 1923) Honorary Colonel of 53rd (City of London) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, Royal Artillery, a new Territorial Army unit that included a battery recruited from Lloyd's of London.Monthly Army List.

Griffith and starring William Holden, Eddie Bracken, Robert Benchley, and Susan Hayward. With a screenplay by Virginia Van Upp based on the play Out of the Frying Pan by Francis Swann, the film is about young, aspiring actors‚Äîthree men and three women‚Äîwho combine their resources and move into the same apartment, hoping to keep the landlady in the dark until they can become famous. Young and Willing was made by Paramount Pictures (as Cinema Guild Productions) and distributed by United Artists. Plot Struggling young actors (three males and three females) share an apartment to make ends meet. This scenario is pretty daring considering the conservative and censorious attitudes of that period. The landlady provides a play to the actors that turns out to have been left behind long ago by a destitute, evicted tenant (Robert Benchley). That former tenant is now a successful theater producer and playwright who has recently taken a room in his old haunts to recharge his creativity and try to rewrite his first play‚Äîone that the landlady had kept when he was evicted. The young actors attempt to sell his own play to him. Complications begin when Cousin Muriel (Florence MacMichael) visits and discovers the sinful cohabitation; she tattles to her folks, who charge over to investigate and drag the daughters home. Silliness and mayhem ensue, propelled by Muriel's actions and highlighted by her unique little-girl, tattletale voice.

As a Republican, she was elected to two terms in Congress for the 10th congressional district in northern Virginia. She was defeated for reelection in 2018 by Democrat Jennifer Wexton. From 2010 to 2014, she was a member of the Virginia House of Delegates. She first won election to her seat in 2009. She has worked in numerous positions for various government agencies, including as chief counsel of the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, director of public affairs at the Department of Justice, and as a Congressional staffer. In 2019, she joined the lobbying firm Baker Donelson as a senior advisor. Early life and education Comstock was born Barbara Jean Burns in Springfield, Massachusetts, on June 30, 1959. She is the daughter of Sally Ann Burns, a teacher, and John Ferguson Burns, national manager of polymer sales for Shell Chemicals. Comstock graduated from Westchester High School in Houston, Texas in 1977. She graduated cum laude from Middlebury College in 1981. In college, Comstock spent a semester interning for Senator Ted Kennedy. While interning for Kennedy, Comstock, who was raised a Democrat, became a Republican. Years later, she recalled that she had long reckoned herself as a Reagan Democrat, and during her internship she found herself agreeing more with Orrin Hatch of Utah than with Kennedy. She then attended law school at Georgetown University, graduating with a Juris Doctor degree in 1986. Career After working as a lawyer in private practice, Comstock served from 1991 to 1995 as a senior aide to Congressman Frank Wolf. Comstock then served as chief investigative counsel and senior counsel for the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Government Reform from 1995 to 1999, working as one of Washington's most prominent anti-Clinton opposition researchers. Comstock worked on behalf of the 2000 presidential campaign of George W. Bush. Her research team built massive stores of paper and electronic data, known as \\"The Gore File,\\" that were a key source of information on the former vice president for GOP publicists and ad-makers. Comstock is credited with writing the Republican \\"playbook\\" defending Bush nominees such as John Ashcroft for U.S. Attorney General. Comstock later served as director of public affairs for the Justice Department from 2002 to 2003. Comstock and Barbara Olson, the wife of United States Solicitor General Theodore Olson, formed a partnership known to Washington insiders as the \\"Two Barbaras.\\" Barbara Olson died in the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. She was a founding partner and co-principal of the public relations firm Corallo Comstock. Comstock joined law firm Blank Rome in 2004. Comstock assisted the defense teams of both Scooter Libby and former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay. In 2005, Comstock was hired by Dan Glickman to lobby on behalf of the Motion Picture Association of America. In 2008, Comstock was a consultant on the presidential campaign of Mitt Romney. Comstock is a former Co-Chair of the Executive Committee of the Susan B. Anthony List. Prior to running for office, she was registered as a lobbyist. =Virginia House of Delegates= In 2009, Comstock was elected to a seat in the Virginia House of Delegates. She defeated incumbent Democrat Margaret Vanderhye by 316 votes. While in the state legislature, Comstock was involved in enacting legislation that increased the penalties for teen sex trafficking. Comstock's public relations firm consulted for the Workforce Fairness Institute (WFI), a conservative group advocating on a variety of federal labor policy issues, from 2008 through 2012. According to a 2014 report by Politico, during her time in the Virginia House of Delegates, Comstock sponsored legislation that advanced WFI's overall public policy objectives. Legislation sponsored by Comstock called for union votes by secret ballot, prevented employers from giving employees' information to unions, and prohibited awarding contracts for state- funded construction projects exclusively to unionized firms. Comstock's campaign responded to the report by saying \\"Barbara Comstock disclosed her federal clients under Virginia law as required.\\" Comstock was re-elected to her seat in the Virginia House of Delegates in 2011 and 2013. When she won a seat in the U.S. Congress in 2014, she formally resigned her seat in the Virginia House of Delegates and a special election was called to replace her. She was succeeded by Democrat Kathleen Murphy, who had been her opponent in 2013. U.S. House of Representatives =Elections= 2014 On January 7, 2014, Comstock announced her candidacy for the U.S. House of Representatives from Virginia's 10th District, following the announcement that incumbent Frank Wolf would retire at the end of the 113th Congress. On April 26, 2014, Comstock won the Republican nomination for the U.S. House of Representatives in the 10th District primary, defeating five other candidates and winning approximately 54% of the total vote. Comstock and Republican U.S. Senate candidate Ed Gillespie planned on attending a public meeting of the Northern Shenandoah Valley Tea Party in early August 2014. After rumors arose that the gathering could be infiltrated by Democrats, both candidates initially moved the meeting to a private location before opting to speak with the group by phone instead. This decision prompted a statement from David Sparkman, chairman of the Tea Party group, who said \\"I'm disappointed, I wanted to look these politicians in the eye and take their measure.\\" Comstock received the endorsements of the United States Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent Business, and both the Virginia Association of Realtors and the National Association of Realtors. On August 28, 2014, Comstock received the endorsement of the Virginia Police Benevolent Association (VAPBA). In 2012, the VAPBA had endorsed the Democratic challenger to Representative Frank Wolf in the same district. Shortly before the 2014 election, Comstock's Democratic opponent, Fairfax County Supervisor John Foust, said that she had never had a ‚Äúreal job.‚Äù ‚ÄúAlthough he claims he was referring to her jobs in partisan politics,‚Äù stated the Weekly Standard, ‚ÄúComstock‚Äôs campaign attacked this as a sexist remark.‚Äù Comstock herself called the remark ‚Äúoffensive and demeaning.‚ÄùSantos, Maria; Comstock Leans In; Weekly Standard; October 31, 2014; https://www.weeklystandard.com/maria- santos/comstock-leans-in Comstock won the election on November 4, 2014, defeating Democrat John Foust with 56 percent of the vote. 2016 Comstock faced Democrat LuAnn Bennett, a real estate executive and ex-wife of former Virginia Congressman Jim Moran, in the 2016 election.LuAnn Bennett declares congressional bid against Barbara Comstock Given the swing state status of Virginia in the 2016 presidential election, the race was expected to be one of the most heavily contested races in the country.Outrunning Bellwethers and Coattails in a Swing State Democratic strategist Ellen Qualls said the 10th District is \\"essentially the swingiest district in the swingiest state.\\" In early October, following the release of the Donald Trump Access Hollywood tape, Comstock called for Donald Trump to drop out of the presidential race. She released a statement that in part said \\"This is disgusting, vile, and disqualifying. No woman should ever be subjected to this type of obscene behavior and it is unbecoming of anybody seeking high office. In light of these comments, Donald Trump should step aside and allow our party to replace him with Mike Pence or another appropriate nominee from the Republican Party.

He is currently Professor of New Testament at Northern Baptist Theological Seminary in Lisle, IL. McKnight is an ordained Anglican with anabaptist leanings, and has also written frequently on issues in modern anabaptism. Childhood and education McKnight was raised in Freeport, Illinois. He earned a B.A. from Grand Rapids Baptist College (now known as Cornerstone University), an M.A. from Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, and, in 1986, a PhD from the University of Nottingham, where he studied under James Dunn, who is known for his work on the New Perspective on Paul. Career McKnight was the Karl A. Olsson Professor in Religious Studies at North Park University from 1994 to 2012. Prior to joining the NPU faculty in 1994, he was a professor of New Testament at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School. McKnight is a prolific author, and has written more than fifty books. One of his most popular books, The Jesus Creed, won the Christianity Today book award for 2004 in the area of Christian living, and has spawned a number of popular small group studies and a DVD series. McKnight's blog, Jesus Creed (formerly hosted by Beliefnet and now by Patheos) is currently one of the most popular Evangelical blogs online. McKnight is a popular author and speaker on issues related to the emerging church; his blog was named the most popular blog online related to the movement.http://www.andyrowell.net/andy_rowell/files/scot_mcknight_what_is_the_emerging_church.pdf He has supported many of the movement's aims. In recent years, however, he has expressed concern about the direction of the movement, particularly regarding the \\"emergent\\" stream within the emerging church and some of the work of Brian McLaren. McKnight and California pastor Dan Kimball more or less officially broke with the emerging movement, and have since formed ReGeneration, an initiative that focuses on ministry to and with young adults. McKnight has lectured in numerous countries, including Canada, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Denmark, England, and Ireland. He has also been identified with the New Perspective on Paul. In April 2014 McKnight announced that he had joined the Anglican Communion, and on April 26, 2014 he was ordained into Anglican Holy Orders as a Deacon at Church of the Redeemer in Highwood, Illinois. In January 2017, McKnight began a series of posts explaining more about his transition into the Anglican tradition. He emphasized how much the church calendar was key in his decision to become Anglican, and included screen shots from Robert Webber's 2004 book Ancient Future Time: Forming Spirituality through the Christian Year. Personal life McKnight and his wife, Kristen, a psychologist, live in Libertyville, Illinois and have two grown children. He and his daughter, Laura Barringer, coauthored the children's version of The Jesus Creed, called Sharing God's Love: The Jesus Creed for Children (2014).

History =Marksense systems= While mark sense technology dates back to the 1930s and optical mark recognition dates to the 1950s, these technologies were first explored in the context of standardized tests such as college entrance exams. The first suggestion to use mark sense technology to count ballots came in 1953, but practical optical scanners did not emerge until the 1960s. The Norden Electronic Vote Tallying System was the first to be deployed, but it required the use of special ink to mark the ballot. The Votronic, from 1965, was the first optical mark vote tabulator able to sense marks made with a graphite pencil.Douglas W. Jones, On Optical Mark-Sense Scanning, Towards Trustworthy Elections, Lecture Notes on Computer Science Vol. 60, Springer, 2010. (author's copy) The oldest optical-scan voting systems scan ballots using optical mark recognition scanners. Voters mark their choice in a voting response location, usually filling a rectangle, circle or oval, or by completing an arrow. Various mark-sense voting systems have used a variety of different approaches to determining what marks are counted as votes. Early systems, such as the Votronic, introduced in 1965, had a single photosensor per column of marks on the ballot. Most such tabulators, such as Optech, used analog comparators that counted all marks darker than a fixed threshold as being votes.Gerald Holzer, Norman Walker and Harry Wilcox, Vote Tallying Machine, U.S. patent 3,218,439, Nov. 16, 1965. The use of digital imaging technology to view the ballot does not necessarily imply more sophisticated mark recognition. For example, the Avante Vote-Trakker simply counts the number of dark and light pixels in each marking area to determine if the mark counts as a vote.Kevin Kwong-Tai Chung, Victor Jun Dong and Xaoming Shi, Electronic Voting Method for Optically Scanned Ballot, U.S. Patent 7,077,313, Jul. 18, 2006. More sophisticated mark recognition algorithms are sensitive to the shape of the mark as well as the total overall darkness, as illustrated by the ES&S; Model 100, introduced in the mid 1990s.Steve Bolton, Tim Cordes and Herb Deutsch, Method of Analyzing Marks Made on a Response Sheet, U.S. Patent 6,854,644, Feb. 15, 2005. An example of a ballot for a Diebold/Premier AV/OS scanner. =Electronic ballot marker= An electronic ballot marker, the ExpressVote, made by . This prints a narrow ballot containing a summary of votes cast in both human-readable and form. An electronic ballot marker (EBM) or ballot marking device (BMD) is a device that can aid voters in marking paper ballots. Typical ballot markers include a touch screen and a variety of assistive devices to serve the needs of voters with disabilities. In 1991, Julien Anno and others filed a patent application for a device resembling a modern electronic ballot marker, with an emphasis on multilingual ballot presentation, not accessibility.Julien Anno, Russel Lewis, and Dale Cone, Method and System for Autonated Voting, , issued Feb. 23, 1993. The Jites and Digivote systems used in Belgium are similar to this, although they use magnetic stripe cards instead of bar codes to record the ballot.Expert Visit on New Voting Technologies, 8 October 2006 Local Elections, Kingdom of Belgium, OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, Nov. 22, 2006. Eugene Cummings filed a patent for an electronic ballot marker specifically designed as an accessible voting interface for optical-scan voting systems in 2003.Eugene Cummings, Ballot Marking System and Apparatus, , issued Jul. 25, 2006. This machine, the Automark, saw widespread use in the United States.Douglas W. Jones and Barbara Simons, Broken Ballots, CSLI Publications, 2012; see Section 5.5, pages 111-115, and Section 9.3, pages 218-221. Capital costs and 10 years of maintenance are $11 to $12 per voter for central count systems, if most voters mark their own ballots and one electronic ballot marker is available at each polling place for voters with disabilities, or $23 to $29 per voter if all voters use electronic ballot markers.Pennsylvania: Georgia: Georgia: In the first option, there are also costs for commercial printers to print ballots in all languages needed, with enough extra for the highest possible turnout. In the second option, there is cost for paper and for the electronic ballot marker to print just the ballots used, which means fewer ballots. A New York study assumed equal printing cost per ballot,New York: while a Georgia study assumed $0.10 per ballot to print on demand and $0.40 to $0.55 for commercial printing. If most voters get ballots by mail, these need to be printed commercially, and polling place costs will be at the low end. =Digital pen voting systems= Digital pen voting systems use ballots on digital paper which is recognized by a small camera in the pen while it is marked by the voter. New Generation of Voting Machines in Germany Ulrich Wienser, Hacking the Electoral Law, Page 37ff The ballots are collected in a ballot box and the digital pen is returned to an election official for tabulation. This technology was expected to be used in the 2008 Hamburg state elections, but eventually was decided against due to controversy surrounding the accuracy of voting tallies.Heise.de: Aus f√ºr den digitalen Wahlstift (German) The technology was first used by the town of Menstrie, Clackmannanshire Scotland in their 2006 local community council elections.Electronic voting 'world first', BBC News September 27, 2006 Optical scan process Scanner created image with black line implying votes for multiple candidates Some States Check Election Machines' Counts by Hand The scanner's sensors detect black and white pixels on the paper ballot, at least in the areas designated for marking votes. The scanner's processor interprets the results from the sensors, creates a tally for each candidate, and usually stores the image for later review. The ballot is sometimes immediately interpreted at polling stations allowing for voters to be notified by the voting system of voting errors such as an overvote and some types of spoilt votes. This is known as a precinct-count voting system. Alternately the ballots can be collected in the polling station and tabulated later at a central facility, known as a central-count voting system. Ballots which are torn or otherwise fail to scan are copied by election staff, and the copies are scanned.\\"observers from both political parties there... ballots have to be recreated in every election for a number of reasons, ranging from damaged mail-in ballots, to early voters who use pencils which can‚Äôt be read by ballot tabulators.\\" The scanning machines are faster than hand-counting for long ballots, so are typically used during the election and the night afterwards, to give quick results. There is less speed advantage in parliamentary systems where the member of parliament is the only contest on a ballot, so hand counting is fast and reliable. The paper ballots and electronic memories are stored, so election audits can check if the images and tallies are correct, and so investigations or court challenges can examine them. The advantage of scanning systems over direct-recording electronic voting machines is the availability of paper records for audits and investigations, and if electronic ballot markers are not required, voters do not need to wait for a machine during busy times. Hundreds of errors in optical scan systems have been found, from feeding ballots upside down, multiple ballots pulled through at once in central counts, paper jams, broken, blocked or overheated sensors which misinterpret some or many ballots, printing which does not align with the programming, programming errors, and loss of files. The cause of each programming error is rarely found, so it is not known how many were accidental or intentional. Besides scanner problems, paper ballots are subject to traditional risks, such as ballot box stuffing, ballot destruction and vote buying. These have traditional prevention measures. To address these issues, some have also suggested End-to-end auditable voting systems such as Scantegrity.

On the way there, Uvarov's mother died of typhoid fever. Uvarov's father was executed by a revolutionary tribunal in 1920. Orphaned, she and her brothers lived together their grandfather, witnessing horrors they would never forget. Uvarov's uncle, the entomologist Boris Uvarov (later Sir Boris Uvarov, ), who emigrated to London in 1920, helped his father, niece and nephews sending money, food and clothing. By 1922 with the assistance of the American Red Cross, Boris Uvarov tried to transport the kids out of Soviet Russia, but he could afford only to pay the costs for one child. He selected Olga; she was escorted to Estonia and put on a ship for England. By the time she arrived in England in 1923, she was underweight, had lost her hair and fingernails, and had malaria. Career Uvarov studied at the University of London Royal Veterinary College, where she won the college's bronze medals for Physiology and Histology and qualified in 1934. Following graduation, Uvarov worked first in general mixed practice as an assistant veterinary surgeon, before establishing her own practice in 1944 in Surrey. In 1953, Uvarov joined the Veterinary Department of Glaxo Laboratories Ltd, where she was involved in product development and training sales representatives. While at Glaxo, Uvarov published her research on the development of antimicrobials, and their use in animals. From 1967 until her retirement in 1970, Uvarov was head of Glaxo's veterinary advisory department. In her retirement, from 1970 to 1976, Uvarov headed the British Veterinary Association (BVA)'s technical information department, continuing until 1978 as the BVA's adviser on technical information. Uvarov served as president of the Society of Women Veterinary Surgeons from 1947 to 1949. From 1951 to 1952, she was president of the Central Veterinary Society, and was awarded the Victory Gold Medal by that society in 1965. She was elected to the council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons in 1968, and became a fellow in 1973. She took over as the first woman president of the RCVS in 1976. She was also Vice- President of the Institute of Animal Technicians. Legacy In 2005, the Dame Olga Uvarov Research Award was established, based on a legacy which Uvarov had left to the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. The award, given annually to veterinary researchers, consists of a medal and a prize of ¬£1000. Uvarov's papers are held by the RCVS Knowledge archive. Death Never married, Uvarov's last years were spent in a nursing home at Hatch End until her death at age 91 on 29 August 2001.

Plot The film is set within a harness racing fraternity and explores the conflict between urban and rural values through the medium of an evolving relationship between father and son. The main character in the film, Hoggy, abandoned his wife and son ten years earlier to establish himself in an alternative lifestyle, living in a caravan and caring for his horses. The world gets turned upside down by the arrival of his teenage son, who has a prison sentence hanging over him. Billy has lived his life on an inner-city housing estate, and in his lifestyle theft and drugs are the norm. Using dramatic seasonal changes within the horse-trainer's environment the film follows the development of this fragile relationship. Both father‚Äôs and son's value systems are tested, with dramatic consequences. Cast *Brian Hogg as Hoggy *Darren Bell as Billy Hogg *Mike Elliot as Danker *Jimmy Killeen as Probation Officer *Wayne Buck as Young Lad *Kevin Buck as Young Lad *John Middleton *Charlie Hardwick *Katja Roberts as The Townies Production The roots of the film lie in the making of Seacoal, which was released in 1985. This film depicted the lives of seacoalers on the Northumberland coast, and introduced members of Amber to a passion for horses, and the addictive pursuit of harness racing. The Laidler family, who were featured in Seacoal, proved to have a profound impact. It was they who talked some members of the Amber Production Team into buying their first horse, taught them the rudiments of training and driving, and encouraged their bartering and re-cycling skills. The Laidlers wove the web that pulled Amber into the activity, and secured entry into their environment and the world of harness racing. Amber's method of working is based on building long-term relationships within communities. Their aim is to enter into people's lives in a way that provides an authenticity to film- making that goes beyond simple realism. After becoming established in the harness racing community, Amber introduced actor Brian Hogg into it. His character, Hoggy, was developed over a period during which Brian immersed himself in the lifestyle, contributed to the development of the script, and participated in other essential tasks such as set building and horse training. In contrast, Darren Bell, who played Billy, his son, came directly into his first film role from a background of life on an inner-city housing estate. The film was shot sequentially to facilitate Billy's introduction into an initially alien environment and to reflect on the story of Billy. The film schedule spanned a twelve-month period. We worked with a small crew, two main characters and considerable good will from the harness racing community. Amber Credits Policy Amber Films introduced a policy of collective crediting of its films with the release of Seacoal in 1985. Amber argues that \\"all Amber members are involved in all the different areas of operation\\". Whilst individual members eventually take on specific roles - director, sound recordist, cinematographer - during specific productions, the project's ongoing development is collectively owned by all those involved. Amber therefore credit their films collectively, rather than singling out individuals for roles in the production that are deemed socially superior by conventional society.

Marmorino Veneziano is a type of plaster or stucco. It is based on calcium oxide and used for interior and exterior wall decorations. Marmorino plaster can be finished via multiple techniques for a variety of matte, satin, and glossy final effects. It was used as far back as Roman times, but was made popular once more during the Renaissance 500 years ago in Venice. Marmorino is made from crushed marble and lime putty, which can be tinted to give a wide range of colours. This can then be applied to make many textures, from polished marble to natural stone effects. Widely used in Italy, its appeal has spread through North America especially, but now worldwide. Because of the hours of workmanship, the pricing places it in the high-end market. However, many examples can be seen in public buildings, bars, restaurants, etc. Its waterproofing and antibacterial qualities as well as visual effects have also made it very desirable for luxury bathrooms, honeymoon bedrooms and other wet areas. Not confined to interior use, it can be seen on the exterior of many buildings to great effect. History Marmorino is well known as a classic Venetian plaster; however, its origins are much older, dating to ancient Roman times. We can see evidence of it today in the villas of Pompeii and in various ancient Roman structures. In addition, it was also written about in Vitruvius's De architectura, a 1st Century B.C. history of Rome. Marmorino was rediscovered centuries later after the discovery of Vitruvio's ancient treatise in the 15th century. This 'new' plaster conformed well to the aesthetic requirements dictated by the classical ideal that in the 15th century had recently become fashionable in the Venetian lagoon area. The first record of work being done with marmorino is a building contract with the nuns of Santa Chiara of Murano in 1473. In this document, it is written that before the marmorino could be applied, the wall had to be prepared with a mortar made of lime and \\"coccio pesto\\" (ground terra cotta). This \\"coccio pesto\\" was then excavated from tailings of bricks or recycled from old roof tiles. At this point, to better understand the popularity of marmorino in Venetian life, two facts need to be considered. The first is that in a city that extends over water, the transport of sand for making plaster and the disposal of tailings was, and still is, a huge problem. So the use of marmorino was successful not only because the substrate was prepared using terra cotta scraps, but also the finish, marmorino, was made with leftover stone and marble, which were in great abundance at that time. These ground discards were mixed with lime to create marmorino. Besides, marmorino and substrates made of \\"coccio pesto\\" resisted the ambient dampness of the lagoon better than almost any other plaster. The first because it is extremely breathable by virtue of the kind of lime used (only lime which sets on exposure to air after losing excess water) and the second, because it contains terracotta which when added to lime makes the mixture hydraulic, that is, it's effective even in very damp conditions (because it contains silica and aluminium, bases of modern cement and Hydraulic lime preparations). The second consideration is that an aesthetically pleasing result could be achieved in an era dominated by the return of a classical Greco-Roman style allowing less weight to be transmitted to the foundation when compared to the habit of covering facades with slabs of stone. Usually, marmorino was white to imitate Istrian stone, which was most often used in Venetian construction, but was occasionally decorated with frescoes to imitate the marble, which Venetian merchants brought home from their voyages to the Orient. (In this period of the Republic of Venice, merchants felt obliged to return home bearing precious, exotic marble as a tribute to the beauty of their own city.) Marmorino maintained its prestige for centuries until the end of the 1800s when interest in it faded and it was considered only an economical solution to the use of marble. Only at the end of the 1970s, thanks in part to architect Carlo Scarpa's use of marmorino, did this finishing technique return to the interest of the best modern architects. For about 10 years, industries were also interested in marmorino which was only produced by artisans. Today, however, ready-to-use marmorino can be found, often with glue added to allow it to be applied on non-traditional surfaces such as drywall or wood panelling.

The other exception is following the Kosovo War of 1999, when the province began its political separation from Serbia.  Ottoman rule  Prior to the Ottoman Turkish conquest of the region, documentation on the Jews of the Balkans was sketchy. The Jewish communities of the Balkans were boosted in the 15th and 16th centuries by the arrival of Jewish refugees fleeing the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisitions. Sultan Bayezid II of the Ottoman Empire welcomed the Jewish refugees into his empire. Jews became involved in trade between the various provinces in the Ottoman Empire, becoming especially important in the salt trade.Virtual Jewish History Tour - Serbia and Montenegro The 1455 Turkish cadastral tax census of the Brankoviƒá lands (covering 80% of present-day Kosovo) recorded 1 Jewish dwelling in Vuƒçitrn. > An Austrian statisticDetailbeschreibung des Sandzaks Plevlje und des > Vilajets Kosovo (Mit 8 Beilagen und 10 Taffeln), Als Manuskript gedruckt, > Vien 1899, 80-81 published in 1899 estimated: * Albanians: (48%) * Serbs: > (44%) * Remaining 8%: Tsintsars, Turks, Circassians, Romani, and Jews  Yugoslavian rule  In the aftermath of World War I, Serbia merged with Montenegro, and then united with the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs to form the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which was soon renamed Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The largely Albanian-populated Kosovo was included within Serbia. At the time, some 500 Jews resided in Kosovo. The 1921 population census for the territories comprising modern-day Kosovo listed 439,010 inhabitants: > By religion: * Muslims: 329,502 (75%) * Serbian Orthodox: 93,203 * Roman > Catholics: 15,785 * Jews: 427 * Greek Catholics: 26  World War II and The Holocaust  In 1941, Kosovo was incorporated into the Italian-ruled Greater Albania. In July 1943, when Italy left the war, the Germans took control of Kosovo. In 1944, communist partisans recaptured Kosovo from Albania and made it part of the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia. = Deportations and death / survival figures = Critical evaluation of all reference materials listed below should be skillfully employed to filter internal bias within the source. Current literature indicates four sets of numerically recorded deportations from Kosovo: 1) August 1941, Mitrovica, under German occupation, 88 Jews are reported to have been sent to Sajmiste Concentration Camp near axis occupied Belgrade where they were killed. Prior to deportation all Jewish men in Mitrovica / Mitrovice are alleged to have been arrested, while women were sent to daily forced labor. In February 1942, the women are said to have been detained with their children, Jewish property taken by local collaborators, and Synagogue destroyed. A 1960 report to the Administration of the State Security of NR Serbia details names of victims from 12 families shot at the camp in winter 1941. [While source shows significant signs of bias in tone, second generational verbal accounts of deportations from Mitrovica can still be sourced today. Supplementary survivor testimony in the Shoah Foundation Archive also makes reference to experience of the holocaust in relation to movements through Kosvoska Mitrovica] 2) 1942, Prishtina. 250 Yugoslav Jews, including an unknown number of native Kosovo Jews, transferred to the Albanian interior. As of 1943 historian Daniel Perez relates they made up part of 500 Jews held under house arrest or in concentration camps in the Albanian towns of Berat, Kruja and Kavaja. He also indicates movements of both native and non-native Jews from Kosovo to Albania were ongoing throughout the war period. 3) March 1942, Prishtina. Italian military police detained 51 Jewish refugees and passed them to the Nazis. According to historian Noel Malcolm they were sent to Sajmiste. Daniel Perez details that the deportation list was compiled by Italian authorities and local Albanian police and that they were first sent to a \\"concentration camp\\" [probable terminiological error] in Prishtina before being transferred to Mitrovica.Malcolm, Noel. Kosovo: A Short History. New York: New York University Press, 1998, Pages 213, 231,310 4) May 14, 1944, Prishtina. Nazi Chief Heinrich Himmler organized the Skanderburg Unit which were commanded by the Germans to arrest 281 Jews who were sent to Bergen-Belsen via occupied Belgrade where, according to Noel Malcolm, 'more than' 200 died, or according to Martin C√ºppers, 'at least' 177 died.Martin C√ºppers, ‚ÄúMission in 'Greater Albania': The 21st Weapon Mountain Division of the ss 'Skanderbeg'‚Äù (paper presented at conference in Tirana, 19‚Äì20 May 2008 Though the majority of historians seem to draw consensus around the 281 figure Albanian historian Haxhi Bajraktari is said to have written that only 43 Jewish names were included in a total of 249 deportees, whom he describes as mainly Communists and Partisans.Marr√´dh√´njet Shqiptaro-Hebraike, Instituti Shqiptar i Studimeve Politike, Tiran√´, printed in Prishtin√´ in Albanian in 2009 Analysis of apparently original Nazi transport lists (as yet unverified by this author) suggest Bajraktari's apparent figures for Jews to be understated. Serbian historian Pavle Dzeletovic Ivanov also puts the number of arrests on May 14 at 400 (which conversely suggests overstatement). The names of those who both survived and perished at Bergen-Belsen are recorded at source Noel Malcolm summarises that out of 551 native Kosovo Jews present before war, 210 had died by the end. [Non-correspondence with the preliminary evidence above as incidents 1 and 4; (210 + 88) = approx 298. This could be because Malcolm may not have come across, considered or rejected the Mitrovica deportations]. Video interviews with Kosovo Jews who survived the Holocaust can be found at the Shoah Foundation. = Extracts from witness statements = An extract from the statement of Hedviga Sch√∂nfein, prisoner of the Judenlager Zemlin (Sajmi≈°te) prison camp has been published by the Centre for Democracy and Reconciliation in South East Europe: \\"Immediately upon our arrival at the camp, the Germans told us that the camp would gradually be evacuated, because they intended to imprison communists at the Fair, but they did not want to tell us where they were going to take us.‚Ä¶ For the first transfers they invited volunteers and the first to be invited was the group I was from ‚Äì Jews from Kosmet. (‚Ä¶) Those who were designated for transport were ordered, or, more precisely, kindly advised to take their most valuable possessions with them, and to pack all the rest carefully and put their exact address on the package. (‚Ä¶) Thus, these transfers departed almost every day. On Sundays and holidays there were usually no transfers or removals, but there were days when the car would make two rounds. The driver of the grey car often entered the camp alone, gathered children around him, caressed them, took them in his arms and gave them candies. The children liked him and whenever he came, they would rush toward him to get candies. No one in the camp suspected that people were taken to their deaths. It was strongly believed they were being transferred into a work camp.\\" A statement from Albert Ruben suggests a deportation from Prishtina in winter 1943, not recorded by the academic historians above: \\"At the end of 1943, it was already winter, maybe November or December, the SS men came to all Jewish homes to round us up. They got us out of our beds and took us straight to the barracks near the football field. There were a lot of us, more than four hundred people. We stayed there for two days. Everyone brought some food with them. We didn't have a toilet, so we dug a hole and put some wooden boards over it. They were threatening us, telling us to hand over our gold and other valuables, and we were throwing them into the toilet. What we had not given to the poor earlier we were now throwing into the toilet. Before long they put us into cattle wagons and drove us to the Belgrade camp for Jews at the Sajmiste.\\" = Further sources of information on WWII and Holocaust period = Extensive information on the German occupation of Albania proper, with original Nazi source materials referring to Kosovo, can be found in the work of Robert Elise. A thorough critique of the teaching of the subject of WWII and the holocaust in Kosovo schools has been produced by Oral History Kosovo.  Post-war community  The Federation of Jewish Communities in Yugoslavia was formed in the aftermath of World War II to coordinate the Jewish communities of post-war Yugoslavia and to lobby for the right of Jews to immigrate to Israel.Jews of the Former Yugoslavia After the Holocaust The Federation was headquartered in Belgrade, the capital of the post-war Yugoslavia. More than half of the surviving Yugoslav Jews chose to immigrate to Israel after World War II. The Jewish community of Serbia, and indeed of all constituent republics in Yugoslavia, was maintained by the unifying power of the Federation of Jewish Communities in Yugoslavia. However, this power ended with the dissolution of Yugoslavia in the 1990s.  Yugoslav wars  The Jews of Serbia lived relatively peacefully in Yugoslavia between World War II and the 1990s. According to the 1991 census, there were 112 Jews in Kosovo, though it is possible that there have been more. However, the end of the Cold War saw the breakup of Yugoslavia, and wars in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The war for Kosovo began in the 1990s, when Serbian leader Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá began consolidating power in Kosovo and the Kosovo Liberation Army waged a separatist insurgency. In 1999, international forces expelled Serb forces from Kosovo. During the conflict, the 50 remaining Jews in the capital city of Pristina fled to Serbia, with which they had close cultural and linguistic ties.  Post-war Kosovo  Currently there are very few Jews in Kosovo, according to ƒåeda Prlinƒçeviƒá, the leader of Pristina's small Jewish community. The lone Jewish community in Prizren speaks Albanian and Turkish, and has remained for the time being. This community numbers around 50 members, divided among three families. There are no Jewish schools. Unemployment is prevalent, and support for the community comes from the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee. There has been some amount of intermarriage with the surrounding Albanian community. The father of Votim Demiri, Prizren's Jewish community leader, is Albanian. Israel has good relations with the Kosovars, with the Israeli government sending massive humanitarian aid during and after the 1998-99 war with Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá's regime. As of 2020 Israel has recognized Kosovo's independence and Kosovo will move its embassy to Jerusalem.

Construction and commissioning M3 was ordered from Armstrong Whitworth on 28 July 1916 and laid down at Elswick in December as an M-class submarine, but was referred to as K20. She was launched on 19 October 1919, and commissioned as M3 on 16 March 1920. After completion of trials on 17 August, she was placed in reserve. Service M3 was recommissioned on 4 July 1921 under the command of Lieutenant-Commander Hugh Marrack, and joined the 1st Submarine Flotilla on 17 February 1922. From 9 May to 14 May 1926, along with fellow submarines and , M3 was used to help supply electricity to the Royal Victoria Dock, Royal Albert Dock and King George V Dock in London, during the General Strike of 1926, in an action named Operation Blackcurrent. M3 alone kept four meat cold stores, two cranes, and many important pumps running. Minelayer M3, original monitor configuration M3, minelayer configuration (1928 onwards) On 15 October 1926 M3 was placed in reserve until 13 June 1927 when she arrived at Chatham to be converted to an experimental minelayer, as a result of the Washington Naval Treaty. The conversion was called a refit for political reasons. Her and guns were removed to make room for a large free-flooding superstructure extending over about 75% of her length. Two sets of rails ran along the pressure hull inside this structure, capable of accommodating 100 standard Type B contact mines. The mines were laid by means of a conveyor chain through a single large door at the stern. The conversion was completed on 8 October 1928 at a contemporary cost of ¬£10,235, and M3 finished her trials by the middle of November. Only 80 mines were carried initially, the remaining 20 being embarked later. The minelaying machinery and mines added approximately 54 tons to the submarine's mass, and also had adverse effects on M3s diving ability - the time required to flood the large casing (which held 600 tons of water) meant that it took around 5 minutes to dive in calm weather, and at least 13 minutes in rough weather, and was dangerously slow to catch a trim. Rear Admiral Martin Dunbar- Nasmith, head of the Submarine Service, was of the opinion in May 1930, that \\"...at present M3 is not efficient or reliable as a submarine and could not with safety be used in war\\". M3 was originally to be scrapped in 1933, but the date was brought forward after the unfavourable reports of her abilities as a minelayer, and she was sold out of service on 6 February 1932, and was scrapped at Newport in April 1932. Experience gained from the converted M3 was used in the design of the Porpoise-class minelaying submarines, which carried their mines in a single row. Other ships The monitor was also known by the name HMS M3 for a short time.

Initiated in 1995 as WJC negotiations with both the Government of Switzerland and its banks over burdensome proof-of-ownership requirements for accounts, strong support from United States politicians and leaked documents from a bank guard pressured a settlement in 1998 in a U.S. court for multiple classes of people affected by government and banking practices. As of 2015, $1.28 billion USD has been disbursed for 457,100 claimants. Negotiations Starting in 1995, the World Jewish Congress (WJC) began negotiations on behalf of various Jewish organizations with Swiss banks and the Swiss government over dormant Jewish World War II bank accounts. Led by Edgar Bronfman, the heir to the Seagram's fortune, the WJC entered a class- action in Brooklyn, New York City combining several established suits in New York, California, and the District of Columbia. The original suits arose from grievances of Holocaust survivors and their heirs against Swiss banks. They alleged improper difficulties in accessing these accounts because of requirements such as death certificates (typically non-existent for Holocaust victims), along with deliberate efforts on the part of some Swiss banks to retain the balances indefinitely. The causes for claims eventually expanded to include the value of art works purported to have been stolen, damages to persons denied admission to Switzerland on the strength of refugee applications, and the value or cost of labor performed by persons being maintained at Swiss government expense in displaced-person camps during the Holocaust, along with interest on such claims from the time of loss. Plaintiffs included all Holocaust victims, not just Jews. Hearings The WJC was able to marshal the unprecedented support of U.S. government officials including senator Alfonse D'Amato R-NY, who held hearings of the Senate Banking Committee in which he claimed to possess \\"recently declassified documents that shed new light\\" on the Swiss role in the war. He also claimed that \\"hundreds of millions of dollars\\" of war-era Jewish assets remained in Swiss banks.Hearings before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, April 23, 1996. At the behest of President Bill Clinton,Hearings before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, May 15, 1997. Testimony of Undersecretary Eizenstat.

It contained no new historical information on Nazi victims' deposits into Swiss banks, and criticized the decisions of U.S. officials who negotiated settlements with Switzerland after the war as being too lenient. Christoph Meili, a Swiss bank guard, also testified at the hearings,Hearings before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, May 6, 1997. Testimony of Christoph Meili. claiming to have witnessed illegal shredding of wartime records at Union Bank of Switzerland (SBG/UBS) in January 1997. He removed wartime records of transactions with German companies and gave them to the Swiss-Israeli Cultural Association. A warrant was issued for his arrest for violation of banking secrecy laws, and he fled to the U.S.. UBS claimed the records were not relevant to dormant Jewish assets. US‚ÄìSwiss tension The hearings led to international friction between the US and Switzerland, with boycotts of Swiss companies and products threatened in several US states. In Switzerland, the most controversial contentionHearings before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, May 15, 1997. Testimony of Ambassador Borer of the Eizenstat report was that Switzerland assisted the Nazis beyond what was necessary for a neutral country, and prolonged the war. Swiss public opinion was overwhelmingly against any settlement. The banks' position was that the settlement demands were grossly out of proportion to the value of unclaimed assets, and the Swiss government's position was that negotiations relating to laundering of assets looted by the Nazis were settled during previous agreements with the Allied governments and could not be reopened, because no new historical information had come to light.The Swiss government paid 250 million francs (1946 francs) to the allies in 1946 as part of a settlement to normalize relations and help rebuild Europe. Audits of dormant accounts ordered by the Swiss government in 1962 and 1995 showed a total of $32 million (1995 dollars) in unclaimed war- era accounts. The WJC rejected initial offers from the banks and demanded payment of $1.8 billion to settle the lawsuit. During the negotiations, the Swiss banks agreed to pay for another audit‚Äîheaded by ex Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker‚Äîof wartime accounts. This audit committee consisted of three representatives from the banks, and three representatives from the Jewish groups. NY City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi played a crucial role in the negotiations, convening a meeting in December 1997 with Swiss bank executives and Democratic Party state treasurers to discuss sanctions such as divesting state funds from Swiss banks and withholding licenses.Codevilla, Angelo M. (2000) Between the Alps and a Hard Place. New York: Regnery Publishing. p.186 Hevesi also withheld an operating license for the merger of Union Bank of Switzerland with Swiss Bank Corporation, who together made $4 billion in profits per year in New York City. Author Angelo Codevilla argues that this was essentially blackmail of the banks by state banking officials, with backing of the US administration, to force a settlement between the banks and the WJC. Negotiations involving the banks, the WJC, and Undersecretary Eizenstat ultimately resulted in a settlement of $1.25 billion in August 1998. The Swiss government refused to take part in the settlement, and started a CHF 300 million Special Fund for Holocaust Victims with the Swiss National Bank.\\"Switzerland winds up Holocaust fund\\", Swiss info, 2002 It also commissioned an independent panel of international scholars known as the Bergier Commission to study the relationship between Switzerland and the Nazi regime. Volcker and Bergier commissions The Volcker commission audit cost CHF 300 million and gave its final report in December 1999. It determined that the 1999 book value of all dormant accounts possibly belonging to victims of Nazi persecution that were unclaimed, closed by the Nazis, or closed by unknown persons was CHF 95 million. Of this total, CHF 24 million were \\"probably\\" related to victims of Nazi persecution.Report on Dormant Accounts of Victims of Nazi Persecution in Swiss Banks Annex 4; and Part I paragraph 41 In addition the commission found \\"no proof of systematic destruction of records of victim accounts, organized discrimination against the accounts of victims of Nazi persecution, or concerted efforts to divert the funds of victims of Nazi persecution to improper purposes.\\" It also \\"confirmed evidence of questionable and deceitful actions by some individual banks in the handling of accounts of victims\\". The Volcker commission recommended that for settlement purposes, the book values should be modified back to 1945 values (by adding back fees paid and subtracting interest) and then be multiplied by 10 to reflect average long-term investment rates in Switzerland. Under these rules, a total of $379.4 million was awarded to account holders or their heirs. Holocaust Victim Assets Litigation In cases where the claimant could be verified but the size of the account could not, a $125,000 award was given. The commission recommended that the remaining balance of the settlement should be given to other victims of Nazi persecution. The Bergier Commission reached similar conclusions about the banks' conduct in its final report, The Bergier Commission Final Report, page 442; and page 518 and found that trade with Nazi Germany did not significantly prolong World War II.

The band originally existed between 1980 and 1985, but reunited in 2007. In 2009, the band put out a new full-length album, titled Mammutation. The word \\"moderate\\" in the band name refers to the Swedish conservative Moderate Party. Biography In 1982, in the line-up with Stefan Elfgren (drums) and Clifford \\"Cliff\\" Lundberg (bass), they made the first recording of the song \\"Nitad\\". The band considered that first version a rough demo, but it was this version that got broadcast on Swedish national radio, which led to instant \\"fame\\" for the band. The song is also noteworthy as it captures the Swedish D-beat trend in a nutshell. Together with Anti Cimex, Moderat Likvidation was the first Swedish band to pick the beat up, and use it on many of their tracks, although Moderat Likvidation never totally went into the D-beat genre, staring themselves blind at Discharge as many others, but tried to stick to the development of their own sound as well. Nevertheless, \\"Nitad\\", when it came, was the fastest, most brutal D-beat song recorded in Sweden, and Europe. It was in Malm√∂ where the notion and expression D-beat first was coined. Before Malm√∂ 1982, no one used the word. This word was in Swedish (D-takt) but it spread, first throughout Sweden and then, transformed into English, all over the world. After their breakthrough with \\"Nitad\\", the band went through a transformation where Fjalle left the band to be replaced by Thomas \\"Tobbe\\" Sj√∂berg on the lead vocals. In this line-up they recorded and commercially released the self-titled 7\\" EP Moderat Likvidation, later commonly referred to as the \\"Nitad EP\\", since the first song on the EP was the rerecorded version of the song (even faster it may be added). Together with Tobbe, they also recorded and released the cassette Anti Fag Music (√Ñgg Tapes, 1983), which led to a lot of discussions and misunderstandings about their political convictions. The title of the release as well as the title song \\"Anti Fag\\" has nothing to do with not liking homosexuals. It was just a play with words and something silly and nonsensical to say - hence funny -, which becomes clear to anyone who knows Swedish and reads the lyrics of the song. The song was written in the studio and references Johnny Bodes Bordellmammans visor. Both these recordings were made in the fall of 1983. But whereas the cassette was released shortly after, the EP had to wait until spring 1984 to be released, due to lack of finances. They had to pay everything themselves, and as they were all unemployed, it took some time for them to raise the money. There weren't any organized raw punk labels around in Sweden at that time so bands had to do it themselves, which is what punk is all about anyway. The EP is therefore released on their own label Kuknacke Records. In the beginning of summer 1984, the band broke up as a result of inner conflicts and turmoil. By that time, Moderat Likvidation had grown to be a force to be considered, and the name had started travelling the world. Not once did they get the opportunity to play outside of Sweden, but when they broke up they had contacts and plans for a smaller tour in Finland and England and a longer one in Italy. Nothing of that happened, and the members all went off in different directions, hardly keeping contact with each other, one exception being Fjalle and Cliff, who dabbled together in Black Uniforms for a while. Then Fjalle went off to Los Angeles for 15 years and the threads between the former members disintegrated. In 2006, the band was reunited much thanks to Stefan who got in contact with Fjalle. The former singer was moving back to Sweden and could tell that Moderat Likvidation was a quite acknowledged act \\"over there\\". Stefan contacted Per and Cliff and got the first interested, but the latter not. The practical work of the reunion all took the shape of straightening out some general misunderstandings about what is a bootleg and what is not. Per and Stefan were in personal keeps of the original 1/4-inch master tapes and had been neither consulted nor asked about providing anything to the Distortion Records release \\"Kuknacke\\" in 1991. Much to their dismay, no profits had reached them either. The whole thing was foul play, but they also understood that much thanks to the Distortion release their name had lived on to meet a new generation punk rockers. But they felt they really wanted to make the release \\"their own\\", so to say, and the sound quality would improve dramatically, making a pressing from the real masters than from a vinyl EP and an ordinary cassette. So they looked around for a suitable label and found many interested ones from around the globe. They settled for Havoc Records (USA) and made a total reissue of their catalogue. This came in the following guise: three different 7\\" EPs: Marionett i Kedjor, Nitad, K√∂ttahuve, first released in a special and limited \\"boxed\\" edition with some paraphernalia and the vinyls in three different colors (which led to confusion since the colors got mixed with content so people would have to by the entire suite and swap the records to get it right), followed by an unlimited pressing with the three EPs sold separately and in ordinary black vinyl. After that, it was time for the CD release Never Mind The Bootlegs, which contained all the material compiled together in the chronological order of original recording. =Start= Despite, or maybe thanks to, the two first line-ups hardly making it beyond the rehearsal room, they were able to bury themselves in hours of practice, and as a result they grew increasingly proficient on their instruments and were able to play faster and harder, slowly drifting away from the punk sound of the seventies and into the eighties, towards a harder, more contemporary sound. Eventually, Per and Fjalle had to make some fundamental changes in the line-up to accomplish this. In 1982, the first ‚Äúreal‚Äù line-up was a fact, called Moderat Likvidation Mark I, consisting of Per, Fjalle, Stefan and Cliff. =Mark I= Now they solidified and produced a recording that would carry the watermark of their typical sound, a sound that eventually would render them international reputation and acclaim ‚Äì which at the time being couldn‚Äôt be further away from their minds; they just struggled to get their act together and considered the recording to be a rough demo. The songs on the 1982 tape found their way onto different compilations, but were initially never put on vinyl. The big turnaround for the band was when the song Nitad was played on the alternative radio show Ny V√•g (meaning New Wave) that was broadcast on National Radio all over Sweden. The requests for them started dropping in and a series of chaotic gigs saw to that their reputation grew; they were an exhaustive live act and always up for some good mischief. But along with success came tearings in the band and soon Fjalle departed, being replaced by Tobbe on the vocals. Tobbe, who had had some minor success in a local Malm√∂ punk act called Hj√§rnsubstans was chaotic and disorderly enough to fit into the band. The year is now 1983 and the Mark II setting is here. =Mark II= The ambitions in the band had grown and they decided to record a 7\\" EP. It also entailed a rerecording of some of the songs from the 1982 tape (\\"Nitad, Tio Timmar, Enola Gay\\") but with slight modifications. Soon after that, in fact they had merely left the studio, the band won a contest announced in a local newspaper, which led them straight into yet another recording situation; the first prize in the contest being a demo recording session with the Malm√∂ Radio‚Äôs brand new (and quite impressive) Mobile Recording Unit. The place of recording was set to the old Victoria Theatre in the city center of Malm√∂ and the band set up their gear on the stage with the Mobile Unit van placed outside in the backyard. All the reverb on the recording is the true ambience of the theatre and is not something placed there artificially in the mix, although you could say that a little attention and less sloppiness from the sound engineer could have balanced it better in the mix. Anyhow, the schedule was tight, their allotted time merely three hours, but with the material sufficiently rehearsed they managed to record all the new songs they had ‚Äì which were 5 ‚Äì in less than two hours. The band now insisted on recording yet another song and with the spare time on their account they started playing around with different ideas. Everyone contributed. Even Fjalle did, although it was almost a year since his departure from the band. For in Per‚Äôs guitar case there was a whole bunch of old lyrics and notes and on one piece of paper they found some really funny pornographic words written by Fjalle. They all had great laughs when completing the lyrics and in the end it was so hilarious that Tobbe had a really hard time containing himself during the vocal takes. Had anyone in that moment told them that the selfsame lyrics, and especially the chorus where Tobbe screamed the nonsensical words ‚ÄúAnti Fag‚Äù, was to become a stumbling block to many ‚Äúpolitically correct‚Äù people they would have fallen on top of each other laughing their asses off. However, after the (double!) recording sessions Moderat Likvidation played a whole bunch of gigs and managed to get the Victoria Theatre tapes released as Anti Fag Music on company √Ñgg Tapes in Gothenburg at the same time as they had their 7‚Äù recording sent to Stockholm for mastering. It was hectic days, but all seemed to be going well in the M.L. camp. However, a few days before Christmas the same year, when they had enjoyed a well-needed break from each other for some weeks, Stefan left the band without any formal warning. Although the atmosphere in the band had always been one of great turmoil and stress ‚Äì what the hell, where talking about a rock band here - Stefan‚Äôs leave from the band came as a big shock to the members, and even worse; it had a devastating consequence for the sound of the band. It would show, it was even worse than that: it was the beginning of the end. =End= What then followed was first a replacement drummer, Jens, brought in from the wings by Cliff, and when that didn‚Äôt seem to work and when both Jens AND Cliff left the band in the spring of 1984 there followed a whole kitchen full of concoctions of members that in no way could live up to the sound of Moderat Likvidation. The punk scene in Malm√∂ was dying: many friends had disappeared, ended up in jail, on drug rehabilitation or become locked up in the hospital's mental wards (either of their own volition or forced by law). The non-conformist heavy way of living was taking its toll on the scene. People were just disappearing and ironically enough it was during these last days of punk in Malm√∂ that Moderat Likvidation released their self entitled EP (Later known as the Nitad EP) and started to reach outside of Sweden. (According to hearsay, tape of Anti Fag Music reached the ears of Dead Kennedys singer Jello Biafra and that he banned Moderat Likvidation for being Nazis because of the lines ‚ÄúSieg Heil‚Äù in the chorus of the anti-Nazi skinhead song ‚ÄúK√∂ttahuve‚Äù.) Per and Tobbe, the only true members left, tried to keep the ML-machine going but despite the ever so many gigs, interviews and phone calls coming in from all over Europe, requesting them to come and play their venues, the ML-machine felt less like a band and more and more like giving a corpse artificial respiration. Success or no success the band had had it. In hindsight, it is amazing that a band with such a short heyday ‚Äì not more than three years ‚Äì has been able to produce this acclaimed congruent sound with so many members (12) passing through the ranks. Credits should be given them all, although it forever will be true that the Moderat Likvidation of the 80s should be considered the Mark I and Mark II, the only line-ups that did any recordings because it were the only line-ups that produced anything that made a difference.

It is also called ‚Äúlittle forest angel‚Äù in Taiwan and ‚Äúeight colored bird\\" in Japan, Taiwan, North Korea and South Korea. The fairy pitta breeds in East Asia and migrates south to winter in Southeast Asia. Due to various habitat and anthropogenic disruptions, such as deforestation, wildfire, hunting, trapping, and cage-bird trade, the fairy pitta is rare and the population is declining in most places. Listed on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Appendix II, this bird is classified as vulnerable on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Taxonomy The fairy pitta was first described as a member of the order Passeriformes and the family Pittidae in 1850. It was originally considered to be the same species as the Indian pitta (P. brachyura), native to India and Pakistan. However, due to differences in plumage, morphology, and vocalization, the fairy pitta was recognized as a separate species in 1996. In contemporary taxonomy, the fairy pitta forms a superspecies with the Indian pitta, mangrove pitta (P. megarhyncha) and blue-winged pitta (P. moluccensis). Among the 30 species of Pittidae worldwide, the fairy pitta is the most northerly and only species breeding in Northeast Asia. Description The fairy pitta has a body length of 16‚Äì19.5 cm and is easily discernable for its plumage of seven different colors reminiscent of a rainbow. Its back and wing bows are green, scapulars (shoulders) and upper tail coverts are green and cobalt. There is a blue rump on upper tail coverts. The tail is dark green with a cobalt tip, and the tarsi (legs) are yellowish brown. The fairy pitta has different colors of wing coverts as well. Its primary coverts are dark blue, secondary coverts are greenish blue, greater and middle coverts are dark green, and lesser coverts are cobalt or bright blue. The bird's white patch on each of their brownish- black primaries are noticeable when it flies. Its lower body, including nape (side back), chest, and side, is cream-colored, except for the lower belly and undertail coverts, which are red. The bird has a chestnut crown. From its forehead to the back of its head is mantled with brown plumage, whereas its median is striped with black from lores (between the eye and the beak) to nape. The off-white supercilia (eyebrows) extend across the nape. The fairy pitta has a white throat and a black beak. Distinguishing sexes based on appearance and plumage is difficult as there is no significant size difference between males and females. A species with a similar appearance is the blue- winged pitta, which is larger than the fairy pitta. The blue-winged pitta has buff crown sides and supercilia, rather than the chestnut of the fairy pitta, brighter upper tail coverts, darker yellowish brown belly, and vivid blue on upper wing coverts. The song of the fairy pitta is clear and whistled kwah-he kwa-wu, which is similar to that of the blue-winged pitta, but longer and slower. Distribution and habitat Fairy pitta in southern Thailand The fairy pitta is a migratory birds and travels from Northeast Asia, where it breeds in summer (April‚ÄìSeptember) to South and Southeast Asia to spend the winter (October‚ÄìMarch). Sightings have been reported from India and Indochina, including both the Bruneian and Kalimantan sides of the island of Borneo, and New Guinea, as well as in China, North Korea, South Korea, and Taiwan. Recorded stopovers are in North Korea, Vietnam, Hong Kong, the Philippines, and Thailand. Following the same migratory routes in both spring and autumn every year, the majority of passages occur in April and September to October. Even though the bird is fairly widespread throughout the eastern part of Asia, the fact that it is highly localized in subtropical forests suggests that the fairy pitta is faithful to wintering sites and requires specific habitat conditions. The fairy pitta leaving from Borneo in spring arrives in the Korean Peninsula in early or mid-May and departs back to south in October. However, migrations occur throughout the country in spring and winter. The fairy pitta breeds on the coasts, islands, or in dense and moist deciduous forests, such as camellia forest, in Hwanghae Province, Gyeonggi Province, South Gyeongsang Province, and South Jeolla Province. Among those habitats, the fairy pitta mostly prefers islands off the southern part of Korea. Especially in Geoje in South Gyeongsang Province and Jeju Island, regular visits of the fairy pitta to the same locations have been reported. In Jeju Island alone, more than 60 pairs are thought to be breeding regularly in the altitude of 100 m to 600 m in Halla Mountain, making the island the most important breeding ground in South Korea. Subspecies in the Korean Peninsula is distributed to East China, as far as to the Shandong Peninsula, and limited regions in Taiwan. In Japan, the fairy pitta arrives at both the Sea of Japan and the Pacific sides of southern Japan, including the islands of Kyushu, Honshu, Shikoku, Tsushima, with notable populations in Miyazaki Prefecture, K≈çchi Prefecture, Hiroshima Prefecture, and as far north as Hokkaido, in mid- May. Similar to the groups breeding in Korea, the fairy pitta in Japan favors places with dense undergrowth of bushes, ferns, scrub, and grass, but with good visibility to be aware of predators or disturbances. The bird here exclusively nests in coastal deciduous evergreen forests. In 1991, 93.5% of the breeding sites were found in broadleaf evergreen or deciduous forest, whereas only 6.5% were in mixed coniferous-broadleaf forest. In recent years, however, a trend of the fairy pitta nesting in plantations has been noticed. In K≈çchi Prefecture, for instance, the fairy pitta prefers Japanese red pine (Pinus densiflora) forest during the early days of its breeding season. The fairy pitta in Japan mostly dwells on hill slopes below the altitude of 500 m, but occasional recordings indicate that some pairs live at altitudes as high as 1,200 m. In Taiwan, the species was similarly found to favor areas covered with thick crown layer, variety of trees, no shrub or vine near the nest, and steep slopes that prevent intrusion of other animals. Arriving in mid to late April, the bird is usually spotted in the central and western regions, where much of the land is hilly or mountainous, at altitudes no higher than 1,300 m. In China, the fairy pitta seems to be widely distributed in the mountains in the southeast, in mixed forests at altitudes between 500 m and 1,500 m. The same preference extends to Hong Kong, where the bird stops along its course of migrations. Behavior The fairy pitta is a territorial bird, and the male defends its territory through calls. Its general habit is however secretive. From mid-May to early June, sometimes to late July, it likes to perch on a high tree branch in a posture resembling that of a kingfisher. However, the fairy pitta tends to repeatedly shake its tail up and down while singing on a branch. =Diet and feeding= The fairy pitta mostly feeds on the ground, wandering solitarily. Its diet largely consists of earthworms of several species, beetles, and other hard-shelled insects. A variety of other small animals such as lepidoptera larvae and adults, spiders, snails, lizards, frogs, small snakes, and shrews, occasionally form part of its diet. Earthworms make up 73%-82% of the diet fed to the nestlings, followed by homoptera larvae (4%-8.6%). Although not entirely identifiable, lepidopteran adults and pupae likely make up 11% of the nestling diet. The fairy pitta's preference for earthworms with their high energy content makes the abundance of this food item critical for nesting success. =Reproduction= The fairy pitta makes a relatively large nest in the dark place, such as in the crevice between rocks in thick broadleaf forest or foliage on a slope, 1‚Äì5 m above the ground. The entrance is lined with cattle dung and the nest itself is lined with lichen. If necessary, the male aggressively defends the nest, chases after and attacking intruders. Such defensive behavior is only displayed until the eggs are laid. The female lays from 4 to 6 eggs per bredding attempt, from May to mid-July. The egg has a light gray background with small light brownish purple and grey dots, and is 25‚Äì27.5 mm in the major axis and 19‚Äì22.5 mm in the minor axis. Both male and female incubate the eggs; the female usually feeds the hatchlings, while the male keeps watch. In the first 4 days after hatching, the fairy pitta rarely leaves the nest. This is probably because temperatures are low during the rainy season and the nestling hatches without any down feathers. The nestling has its first plumage within 14 days after hatching. Throughout the breeding season, the adult bird rarely goes farther than 100‚Äì400 m from the nest. In June or July, the chick fledges, but the rearing continues until the nestling is ready to migrate south. The average reproductive success of the fairy pitta is 41.9%. =Mortality= The predators most affecting the reproductive success of the fairy pitta are snakes, followed by mammals such as macaques, cats and weasels. The raiding of nests by jungle crows (Corvus macrorhynchos) and cat snakes during breeding season has also been reported frequently. During migrations, the bird is exposed to danger from falcons. The rate at which adult fairy pittas return from the wintering grounds appears to be 16-26%; most casualties happening on the bird's northward migrating and during breeding seasons from May to July. Fewer birds are lost during the autumn migration in October. Another cause of mortality is window strikes. As for many other species of bird, casualties from human-bird interaction are identified as a leading cause of decline in the fairy pitta. Status and conservation =Population trend and threats= There is no very accurate estimate of total population size of the species. Estimated numbers include ranges of 100 to 10,000 breeding pairs and 50 to 1,000 migrating individuals respectively in China, Korea, Japan, and Taiwan; total population size is thought to be somewhere between a few thousand and a few tens of thousands of individuals. Although researchers estimate that the largest number of birds survive in China, no concrete study has been done. However, a worldwide trend of decline in the fairy pitta is clear enough to lead to a classification of the species as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and as Endangered in CITES Appendix II. The main causes for the decline are habitat loss, trapping, hunting, and human disturbances. The causes of habitat disruption, which encompasses deforestation in the bird's breeding range, are essentially the results of human activity, but the characteristics of threats vary from one region to another. In Japan, where the fairy pitta was originally more common, significant areas of forest have been cleared since the 19th century for fuel and throughout the 20th century for the building of plantations. Since the logging has ceased and old growth forests have begun to recover, the fairy pitta population is expected to gradually increase. In contrast, vast forested areas in Southeast China have in the last 50 years been clear-cut or converted due to an increased demand for timber and farmland. There is also a lack of control of forest fires. In Borneo, a fairy pitta wintering ground, the continuing destruction of the Sundaic lowland primeval forest is more devastating. It is one of the most important Biodiversity hotspots in the world, but the deforestation is ongoing even in the protected areas and jeopardizing not only the fairy pitta, but also many other tropical species. Large scale developments also endanger local populations. In Yunlin County, Taiwan, the largest known breeding group of the species is being severely impacted by the flooding from the Hushan Dam project. Despite the imminent threats that the fairy pitta is facing in Taiwan, however, quantitative data on the impact of human disturbance on the population remains limited, undermining the conservation efforts. The threat of hunting has been prevalent in Guangxi, China and Taiwan. Particularly in Taiwan, specimen-collecting and cage-bird trading are thought to have severely reduced the local breeding population in the 20th century. However, as more conservation efforts are made and the significance of the fairy pitta is recognized locally, hunting is expected to diminish. Human disturbances also directly affect individual fairy pittas. In Jeju Island, South Korea, window strikes are one of the leading factors endangering the bird. As more buildings are built in the vicinity of breeding sites, accidental window strikes have consequently increased. Moreover, in Taiwan as well as in Jeju Island, many nests are disturbed by hikers, amateur photographers, birdwatchers, and researchers, which may alter the bird's behavior and increase nest predation risk. On a meta-population level, it is thought that the fairy pitta's relatively narrow distribution in Northeast Asia and the species' regionally specific breeding and wintering grounds are lowering the genetic diversity and fragment the genetic structure of populations. Although more research is needed, this is suspected to compromise its fitness. =Conservation measures= As a response to rapidly declining populations in most areas, an increasing number of studies has focused on the fairy pitta in recent years, and the species is now protected under various national conservation laws. The fairy pitta is classified as a Nationally Protected Species in China, Category II protected species in Taiwan, National Endangered Species in Japan, Category I protected species in North Korea, and a Natural Monument in South Korea. Many pairs benefit from breeding in national parks or reserves that were initially designed to protect other species. Conservation of the fairy pitta requires measures specific to local levels and international cooperation, since the species is exposed to various threats during migration and stopovers. It has been suggested that more surveys of breeding sites, population sizes, and distribution of the bird be conducted along with research into its ecology, current conservation measures in parks, and the need for more sanctuaries. Enforced management of existing protected forests and restrictions on hunting and trapping are critical for saving the species. Specific measures for individual regions have been proposed. On Jeju Island, for instance, it has been advised that developments ‚Äì including the construction of buildings, golf courses, roads, and trails ‚Äì in forested or near breeding areas be regulated, and that a predator control program reducing the number of jungle crows and Eurasian magpies (Pica pica) should be considered.

They can be made from wood, metal or plastic, bottles stops and are usually shaken, scraped or tapped with fingers or a stick. It is a useful category in terms of a large percussion orchestra in that it identifies all instruments that are not drums or pitched percussion such as marimba and xylophone. Shakers Caxixi from Africa Gourd shekere from Africa with seeds in the net. A shaker (percussion) is any instrument that makes a noise when shaken. Historically they were naturally occurring items such as seed pods. A caxixi is a basketwork shaker with a gourd base. Gourds are used all over the world and covered with a net with shells or seeds to create an instrument such as the shekere. Modern shakers are often cylinders made from metal wood or plastic containing small hard items such as seeds, stones, or plastic - an example is the Egg Shaker.There is another category of shaken instrument using jingles, little discs of metal which tap together when shaken. Tambourines fall into this category. Scrapers Modern fibreglass g√ºiro from South America Frog shaped g√ºiro from Japan This can be a wood, metal or plastic instrument which has ridges on its body. Often known as Guiro, rhythms are created by running a thin stick up and down the ridges at different speeds. Gourds or bamboo have traditionally been used as they have a resonant hollow body and can easily be cut with ridges. A common type from Asia is a carved wooden frog which has ridges cut on its back and its mouth and belly hollowed out. Cowbells agogo bell Cowbells originate from the bells tied around the necks of livestock. They are any type of hand held bell tapped with fingers, wood or metal. They occur all over the world and are used extensively in Latin Percussion music and often found as part of a standard Rock Drum Kit. The name cowbell usually refers to a single bell. The Agog√¥ bell usually refers to a double or triple bell. Triangles A modern triangle The triangle is a piece of steel bent in the shape of a triangle tapped with another piece of steel. It is suspended on one hand which can be open and closed to alter the sound. Very commonly used in South American Music to give a persistent high pitched pulse. Sticks A pair of claves Tapping two sticks together is the simplest form of hand percussion, and has developed a place in traditional music all over the world. Indigenous Australians use clapping sticks alongside the didgeridoo, and claves are an integral part of South American Music.

He was a member of Company Linge, a resistance commando unit that was best known for carrying out Norwegian heavy water sabotage during World War II. After the war, he worked for the Norwegian Mountain Touring Association until his retirement in 1982. While volunteering with the Association after his retirement, he helped guide several members of the Scandinavian royalty. According to The New York Times, \\"[he was] the favorite mountain guide of Scandinavian royalty...\\" These clients included Queen Sonja and Margrethe II of Denmark. Early life He was born in Rjukan on 31 January 1919. As a child, he spent much time on the mountains around Rjukan. In 1938, he started working for a touring organization that wanted to make the mountains less forbidding for visitors. World War II He escaped Norway with 400 other Norwegians in January 1942 and arrived in the United Kingdom. Once there, he started commando training with other Norwegians refugees. Nine months later in October 1942, he parachuted, along with four other Norwegians, into the Rjukan region. Helberg, along with his team code- named \\"Swallow\\", were to help guide a British commando team to blow the local power plant Vemork hydroelectric. This plant could have been used to develop heavy water, which could have been used to help Germany develop an atomic bomb. However, the British mission ended in failure. Rather than being pulled out, the team stayed during the winter while a new unit was trained to attack the plant. After Operation Gunnerside, team Swallow stayed in place to monitor developments within the plant. However, Helberg was found out by a German soldier who doggedly pursued him as he skied away. After skiing for hours, an exchange of shots occurred between Helberg and the soldier; the latter was wounded and Helberg, though exhausted, finally got away from the patrol. Because it had gotten darker, he skied off a cliff and broke his arm. He continued to ski for another twelve miles and avoided yet another patrol of German soldiers near Mogen. After receiving help from Norwegians in Mogen and Rauland, he went to the Germans and was able to convince them that he had broken his arm while working for the Germans searching the Hardanger Plateau for the saboteurs. The soldiers believed his story and took him to the German field doctor, and then on to Dalen. Then he went to a hotel and was able to get a room. Soon after he arrived, Josef Terboven, commissioner of occupied Norway, arrived at the same hotel and demanded that a local woman have dinner with him. She refused, and Terboven ordered that everyone in the hotel be arrested and sent off to Grini concentration camp for questioning and possible internment. Helberg knew that if he was arrested and his identity as a resistance fighter discovered he would be executed. He jumped out of the bus that was being used to transport everyone from the hotel to the camp. As a result of the jump he re-injured his arm, but was able to escape.

She had worked in India and by her persistence she returned to the UK to become a qualified doctor. She returned to Madras and eventually lectured in London. She was the first woman to be elected to the honorary visiting staff of a hospital in the UK. Biography Raised by her grandparents, following her mother's death, in a strict Evangelical Christian household, she attended a boarding school in Manchester, then to one in New Brighton, and finally at Mrs Tyndall's School at 16 Upper Hamilton Terrace in London. Aged 19, she met William Scharlieb, ‚Äúwho was engaged in eating his dinners at the Middle Temple, preparatory to his call to the Bar and subsequent practice in Madras as a barrister‚Äù. His initial marriage proposal in February 1865 was met with prompt parental opposition. Mary persisted and eventually the marriage took place in December 1865, and the couple sailed for India almost at once. She became instead one of the first four women students at the Madras Medical College. In three years she gained her Licentiate in Medicine. She set sail to return to England with her children, old enough by then to travel, in a small ship, her eyes fixed on a degree in medicine. Upon her return to England in 1878 she called on Dr. (Mrs.) Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, the only qualified medical woman until 1877, who had recently started the London School of Medicine for Women. Here she met with small encouragement, her prolonged stay in India and her naturally frail physique producing an unfavourable impression of her ability to follow such a strenuous profession. She was, however, accepted, and in 1879, in company with three other candidates for the first medical examination, she passed. In November 1882, aged 37, she received a degree of Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery with Honours in all subjects, the Gold Medal and the Scholarship in Obstetrics; shortly after this she gained second-class Honours in Surgery. As did many men at that time, she went for six weeks to study operative midwifery in Vienna, and by her persistence she obtained practice and experience. She met with Queen Victoria who was curious about the status of Indian women and intrigued by Scharlieb's narrative. In 1883, she returned to India, and became lecturer in midwifery and gyn√¶cology at the Madras Medical College and examiner in the same subjects to the university of Madras. In 1888 she took her London degree of M.D., and from 1887 to 1902 was surgeon at the New Hospital for Women (now the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital, Euston Road) initially assisting Dr. Mrs. Anderson, and being senior surgeon from 1889. In 1897, she obtained the Master of Surgery degree. In 1887 she was appointed lecturer on forensic medicine to the Royal Free Hospital, in 1889 lecturer on midwifery (until 1913), and in 1902 chief gyn√¶cologist. Scharlieb was thus the first woman to be elected to the honorary visiting staff of any general hospital in the UK. She remained in this post until 1908. Amongst her students was Helen Hanson who was so inspired by Scharlieb that she followed her example and became a medical missionary in India.Elizabeth Prevost, ‚ÄòHanson, Helen Beatrice de Rastricke (1874‚Äì1926)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2012 accessed 23 Nov 2017 She began her private practice after returning again to England, on 21 May 1887, with five patients in the morning, at #75 Park Street, where she shared an office with her medical student son. Five months later they moved to number 149 Harley Street, where she lived and practiced for nearly forty years. After she retired from her posts in 1909, she continued in her private professional work. Her new ‚Äúleisure‚Äù time was devoted to public works and to speaking and writing. Honours In 1926, she was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire. She was a member of the royal commission on Venereal Diseases 1913‚Äì16. From 1918-30 she was president of the London School of Medicine for Women. In 1928, she received honorary LLD from Edinburgh University. World War I After the outbreak of World War I she was offered (in September 1914) the charge of one of the Women's Hospitals in Belgium, but, realizing her age and her probable inability to stand the life, she declined. She offered to treat all officers' wives and Belgian women free of charge. She became Chairman of the Midwifery Committee of the Council of War Relief, and spent much of her time and remaining energies in its Maternity Hospital. Religious beliefs An extremely devout Anglo-Catholic (Anglican), she opposed contraception and divorce. She stated that ‚Äúartificial contraceptives are wrong, morally, medically, rationally‚Äù. She put in a powerful plea for the exercise of natural means of spacing the family. She spoke of divorce and her belief that it is unjust even to the guilty party, who, if a second union is contracted by the innocent partner, is ‚Äúthereby prevented from making reparation and by this debarred from full repentance‚Äù. She pleaded for the Church of England to strengthen and expand its own school system: > Among the queerest heresies is that which teaches that children ought not to > be biassed, or, as they say, 'prejudiced' in their spiritual outlook ... > [S]uch parents and guardians are, indeed, biassing and prejudicing their > children's choice, because it is inevitable that children left without > religious instruction must grow up in the belief that the truths of religion > and the practice of religion cannot be of much importance to their parents. Feminism As a feminist she drew heavily on the theories of race superiority and argued that it was only natural that greater equality between the sexes in Britain should be achieved owing to their racial similarity. As a matter of fact, she argued, there is more physical, mental and moral resemblance \\"between an Englishman and an Englishwoman ‚Ä¶ than there is between an Englishman and a Bantu or Hottentot man.\\"Scharlieb, Mary, Womanhood and race-regeneration, Forgotten Books; , Chapt.

He is credited with introducing French surrealism to Japanese poetry, and to translating the works of over 66 French authors into Japanese. Early life Horiguchi was born in the Hong≈ç neighborhood of Tokyo. His father, Horiguchi Kumaichi was the son of ex-samurai from Echigo and a career diplomat with the Foreign Ministry who was the Japanese consul at Incheon during the First Sino-Japanese War. Horiguchi attended the Literature Department of Keio University, but never graduated (which is rather ironic, since his given name \\"Daigaku\\" is written with the same kanji as \\"university\\", and came from the fact that his father was still a student at Tokyo Imperial University when he was born). Even prior to entering the university, he was a member of the Shinshisha (The New Poetry Society) and contributing tanka poetry to Subaru (Pleiades) and other literary magazines, such as Mita Bungaku. Under the encouragement of Tekkan Yosano and his wife Akiko Yosano he also began to write other types of verse. In 1911, Horiguchi left school to accompany his father on overseas postings and during the next 14 years overseas he became fluent in French (assisted by his Belgian stepmother) and interested in French literature, particularly the novels and poetry of the Symbolist movement. He first spent over a year in Mexico, where he was diagnosed with tuberculosis, causing Horiguchi to abandon his father's hope that he become a diplomat, and he devoted his time to writing verse and translation of French works instead. He was in Mexico during the Mexican Revolution, and it was also during this time that he was drawn to Parnassianism as a style of verse. In 1913, the family relocated to Belgium, via Siberia. While in Belgium, he studied the works of Paul Verlaine and the works of the Symbolist movement, including the works of Remy de Gourmont. He subsequently lived for brief periods in Spain, Paris, Brazil and Romania and maintained correspondence with Marie Laurencin and Thomas Mann, whose works he also translated while recuperating at a sanatorium in Switzerland. Pre-war career In 1919, Horiguchi published his first anthology of verse, Gekko to Pierrot (Moonlight and Pierrot), and a book of waka verse, Pan no fue (Pan pipes). On returning to Japan in 1925, he brought out a collection of poems Gekka no ichigun, which introduced the Japanese literary world to the works of Jean Cocteau, Raymond Radiguet, Paul Verlaine, and Guillaume Apollinaire. This work greatly influenced modern Japanese poetry starting from the late 1920s and 1930s. In addition, his translation of Paul Morand's Ouvert la nuit (Yo hiraku; Night opens) had a strong impact on the Shinkankakuha, or the New Sensation School whose best- known exponent was Yokomitsu Riichi. In 1928 he created his own poetry magazine, Pantheon, but its publication was discontinued the following year after he had a falling out with co-author K≈çnosuke Hinatsu. He subsequently launched a new poetry magazine, Orpheon. In 1932, Horiguchi moved to the Ishikawa neighborhood of Tokyo. In 1935, he became vice-chairman of the Japan PEN Club (the chairman at the time was T≈çson Shimazaki), and in May of the same year entertained Jean Cocteau during his visit to Japan, by taking him to see kabuki. However, spoke out against the increasing militarization of Japan, and after promulgation of the National Mobilization Law, went into self- imposed confinement at a hotel on the shores of Lake Nojiri, continuing with his translations of French literature under the ever more vigilant eyes of the censors. In 1941, he was evacuated to Okitsu, Shizuoka, but returned briefly to Tokyo in 1942 to give a eulogy at the funeral of Akiko Yosano. He remained in Shizuoka until 1945, and moved briefly to Sekikawa, Niigata before the end of the war. Post-war career Horiguchi moved back to Shizuoka at the end of World War II, and an anthology of five volumes of his poetry was published in 1947. From 1950, he moved to Hayama, Kanagawa, where he spent the remainder of his life. In 1957, he was made a member of the Japan Art Academy, and met with Andr√© Chamson, the president of PEN International who was visiting Japan, the same year. In 1959, one of his works was awarded the prestigious Yomiuri Prize. Over the next ten years, he was in demand as a guest speaker on modern Japanese poetry around the country. In 1967, his submission of poetry in the traditional Japanese style for the Utakai Hajime contest at the Imperial Palace on the topic of fish drew praise from Emperor Hirohito (an amateur marine biologist), and Horiguchi was awarded the 3rd class of the Order of the Sacred Treasures. In 1970, he became honorary chairman of the Japan Poetry Club, and in November of the same year was made a Person of Cultural Merit by the Japanese government. In 1973, he was awarded the 2nd class of the Order of the Sacred Treasures. In 1976 a limited edition collection of Horiguchi's poems, entitled \\"T√¥ten no Niji\\" (\\"Rainbow in the Eastern Sky\\"), was illustrated by noted modernist artist Hodaka Yoshida, who contributed seven signed and numbered prints to accompany the poems. In 1979 he was awarded the Order of Culture by the Japanese government. Horiguchi died in March 1981 at the age of 89. His grave is at the Kamakura Reien cemetery. During his career, Horiguchi published more than 20 books of poetry. His verses combined the flexibility of the Japanese style with hints of the resonance of the French language, and he was noted for making use of colloquial Japanese words in his translations to come closer to the original imagery, rather than attempting to force the translated poems into a more traditional Japanese format.

After the early 1980s, however, the Revolutionary Guard, as a paramilitary wing of the Revolutionary Committees, became entrenched within the military. They served as a parallel channel of control, a means of ideological indoctrination in the barracks, and an apparatus for monitoring suspicious behavior. The Revolutionary Guards reportedly held the keys to ammunition stockpiles at the main military bases, doling it out in small quantities as needed by the regular forces. Their influence increased after a coup attempt in May 1985, that was blocked mainly thanks to the action of the Revolutionary Guard that engaged regular army units in a series of street battles.

A map of Groenendaal park from the 1950s. Groenendaal park lies at the center of Heemstede, Netherlands. The park includes the grounds of old Heemstede country estates Bosbeek, and Meer en Berg. Along its western borders are the old Heemstede country estates Hartekamp, Huis te Manpad, and Iepenrode. On the eastern boundary is the city cemetery. History In the 17th century Groenendaal was mostly sand dunes. The sand was dug and sold to barges that carried it to Amsterdam for building purposes. Later the resulting fields were used for bleaching linen, and still later for growing tulip bulbs. During the heyday of the tulip craze, Amsterdam merchants purchased land in the Haarlem-Heemstede area for summer homes. Groenendaal park is situated at the site of the former summer home of Amsterdam banker Jan Hope, whose estate Bosbeek was the first example of a large garden in the 'English Style' in the 18th century in the Netherlands. The grounds are part of a long sandy ridge of deciduous forest running in a straight line from the Hague to Alkmaar. The park was designed by John Hope in 1760 and remained in his family for 3 generations. It was purchased by Heemstede and made into a public park in 1913. It has been the scene of two international flower shows, the Flora of 1935 and the Flora of 1953.. Steam engine Jan Hope installed the first steam engine for garden use at the site of this windmill in 1781, which had an opposite purpose than most Dutch windmills. He wanted to pump water into his estate to grow the unusual plants and trees he had cultivated in the dry sand. Dutch windmills are normally used for pumping water out of places. He first built a small windmill much like the one standing today. After hearing of power to be had from steam, he wrote to James Watt and Matthew Boulton to order an improved version of the Newcomen engine. When the big red copper kettle arrived, it was installed by Rinse Lieve Brouwer. In circa 1850 the steam engine was broken down and the copper kettle sold for scrap. The steam engine had a dual purpose; one was to pump water into the garden, en the other was to act as an attraction in and of itself. In the 18th century garden owners went to great lengths to decorate their gardens to attract visitors. The attraction of a steam engine became obsolete when the Cruquius steam engine mill was built down the road. In 1850 the Cruquius mill, together with two others, took 3 years to pump out the Haarlem lake.

The historic site is located within Ogden Mills & Ruth Livingston Mills State Park. The mansion, a New York State Historic Site, is considered a fine example of the great estates built during the Gilded Age. History The dining room Ruth Livingston Mills's bedroom In 1792, Morgan Lewis, the third Governor of New York, purchased an estate covering of about and commissioned the construction of a colonial-style house on the site of the present day mansion. In the summer of 1824, on his visit to the United States, the Marquis de Lafayette dined there on his way upriver to visit Lewis' brother-in-law, Chancellor Livingston.Morse, Howard Holdridge. Historical Old Rhinebeck, Echoes of Two Centuries, Rhinebeck. 1908, p. 242 In 1832, this first house was destroyed by a fire, said to be an act of arson committed by disgruntled tenant farmers. After the fire, Morgan Lewis and his wife, Gertrude Livingston, a sister of Chancellor Robert R. Livingston, immediately replaced the structure with a Greek Revival mansion with 25 rooms. The house was inherited in 1844 by Morgan Lewis's daughter Margaret and her husband Maturin Livingston; and in 1847 by the couple's son Maturin Livingston Jr. (1816‚Äì1888). In 1890, Ruth Livingston Mills, the great-grand daughter of Morgan Lewis and the mother of Ogden L. Mills, Secretary of the Treasury, inherited the estate.\\"Staatsburgh State Historic Site\\" New York State Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation Not long afterwards, Ruth Livingston Mills and her husband, the financier and philanthropist Ogden Mills, commissioned a remodeling and enlargement of the mansion to the architectural firm of McKim, Mead, and White; the principal architect was Stanford White. Work started in 1895 and when completed in the following year, he had turned the house into a Beaux- Arts mansion with 65 rooms, 14 bathrooms, and 23 fireplaces.\\"Staatsburgh State Historic Site\\", Maurice D. Hinchey Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area The work is reported to have cost about $350,000. As part of the process, a coal-powered electricity plant was constructed near the Hudson River to supply the electric lights in the mansion, which was also equipped with central heating. The mansion was used as a residence and for entertaining by the family; they owned five homes in total, and stayed at Staatsburgh mainly during the fall season between mid-September and the Christmas holidays. During this time, they hosted house parties, balls, and dinners. At the remainder of the year, the family stayed in one of their other residences in New York City, Paris, Newport, Rhode Island, and California. Before her death, Ruth Livingston Mills began acquiring lands surrounding the estate. After her death in 1920, Ogden Mills continued to purchase the surrounding property, enlarging the acreage of the property to total over , the size of the mansion grounds at the time that it was given to the state of New York. In 1929, the property was passed on to their son, Ogden Livingston Mills and upon his death in 1937, on to his sister Gladys Mills Phipps. In 1938, Gladys Mills Phipps donated the house and of land to the state of New York as a memorial to her parents. As a State Historic Site, the estate is operated by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation. In 1988, the Friends of Mills Mansion were organized to support the preservation and educational work at the site. Design The outside of the mansion features a massive portico, balustrades, pilasters, and floral festoons. The central part of the mansion is layered into a basement, three floors, and an attic. In the north and south wings, there is a subbasement, a basement, and two floors. Ceilings in the older part of the building dating prior to the enlargement (the first floor of the central part) are about high, whereas the ceilings of the later construction (first floor of the north and south wings) can be about high. The interior of the building is decorated in French styles of the 17th and 18th century. However, some architectural elements of the previous home have been preserved in the process. Preservation The Mills Mansion poses several challenges to preservation: On the outside, a gray sprayed concrete finish which was added later as a preservation measure needs to be removed and replaced with a more suitable surface treatment. At the same time, the decorative cornice and many decorative elements need to be either restored or replaced. On the inside of the building, wall paint and furnishing fabrics are in need of replacement, marble and wooden surfaces need to be cleaned and the objects of the mansion's collection need to be conserved.

He is one of only three horses to win two editions of Britain's premier weight-for-age race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. Background Swain was a bay horse with a white star and snip and white socks on his hind legs bred in Ireland by his owner Sheikh Mohammed. He was one of the best horses sired by Nashwan, the 1989 Epsom Derby winner. Swain's dam, Love Smitten was a successful Canadian-bred racemare whose wins included the Grade I Apple Blossom Handicap. The colt was originally sent into training in France with Andr√© Fabre. Racing career Swain began his racing career in France in 1995 when he won his first five races including the Group Three Prix du Lys, the Listed Prix Reux and the Grand Prix de Deauville. On his final race of the season he started 11/5 second favourite as part of Sheikh Mohammed's entry for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. He finished third of the sixteen runners, beaten three-quarters of a length and two lengths behind Lammtarra and Freedom Cry. At four, he was finished third in the Prix Ganay before being sent to England where he recorded his first success at Group One level when beating Singspiel by a neck in the Coronation Cup. He then finished second to Helissio in the 1996 Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud, and defeated Pentire in the Prix Foy. He finished fourth in his second attempt at the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe before being shipped to North America for the 1996 Breeders' Cup Turf at Woodbine Racetrack: Swain finished third behind Pilsudski and Singspiel. At the end of the 1996 season, Swain was transferred to his owners Godolphin organisation and entered the stable of Saeed bin Suroor. At age five in 1997, Swain defeated both Pilsudski and Helissio to win the 1997 King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. He returned in 1998 to repeat as the winner, making him (at age six) the oldest horse to win the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and the first back-to-back winner since Dahlia in 1973‚Äì74. He also won the 1998 Irish Champion Stakes, but finished second in that year's Coronation Cup and second to Silver Charm in the Dubai World Cup. Sent to Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky for the 1998 Breeders' Cup Classic, Swain wound up his racing career with a third-place finish to Awesome Again and Silver Charm. After earning $3,797,566 in racing, Swain was retired to stud duty. Progeny Swain retired to stand stud at Shadwell's Kentucky farm in 1999 before being relocated to Ascot Stud, Ontario in 2013. Swain was not a success as a stallion: during his time at stud in the United States his stud fee fell from $35,000 to $4,000. He sired 13 stakes winners including: * Dimitrova (Flower Bowl Invitational Stakes) Gr-1. * Nasheej (May Hill Stakes) Gr-2. * Muqbil (Greenham Stakes) Gr-3. Swain was pensioned from stud duty in October 2011 and was returned to Shadwell in Kentucky to live out the rest of his life.Swain Pensioned Retrieved 2012-09-05 Swain's last standing fee was CA$3,500.

Her family is knowns as the Faronids, named after her brother Saint Faro. Her name may mean: 'She who moves the Burgundians' (as in Latin verb: Fero, fers, ferre, tuli, latum) Jonas of Bobbio's life of Columbanus reports that she was blessed by the Irish monk when a child: > Then Columban went to the city of Meaux. There he was received with great > joy by a nobleman Hagneric (Chagneric, father of Burgundofara), who was a > friend of Theudebert [King Theudebert II], a wise man, and a counsellor > grateful to the king, and was fortified by nobility and wisdom. ... Columban > blessed his house and consecrated to the Lord his daughter Burgundofara, who > was still a child, and of whom we shall speak later.Life of St. Columban, > chapter 50. Jonas's life of Burgundofara picks up the tale. She is betrothed against her will, and against Columbanus' prediction, and straight away falls deathly sick. Her father Chagneric says to Eustasius of Luxeuil, who happens to be present, \\"Would that she might return to health and devote herself to divine service!\\" Burgundofara recovers, thanks to Eustasius's prayers, but her father goes back on his word and decides to give her away in marriage. She discovers this, and flees to the church of Saint Stephen in Meaux. There her brothers Faro and Chagnoald catch her, and are set on killing her for disobeying their father Chagneric, but the timely arrival of Eustasius settles matters. With Eustasius's support, and the approval of Bishop Gundoald of Meaux, Burgundofara established an abbey on her father's lands. First called Evoriacum, it was later renamed Faremoutiers in her honour. Studies of Burgundofara's life, and those of noble heiresses in similar situations, lead some writers to conclude that in fact the abbey was very likely established with her father's blessing, and the supposed parental insistence upon her marriage may have been no more than a front, especially if the marriage was proposed by the King. An edict of King Chilperic I a generation earlier had favoured the claims of daughters in inheritance over those of uncles and nephews, making the marriage of an heiress of considerable importance to the wider family. The feast of Saint Burgundofara is celebrated on 3 April, probably in error. At Faremoutiers, she was commemorated on 7 December.

The Cumulus Media outlet is licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to broadcast at 103.1 MHz with an ERP of 6 kW. The station goes by the name 103.1 Kiss FM and its current slogan is \\"Columbia‚Äôs Best Variety of R&B.;\\"Its studios are located at the Tower building in Downtown Columbia, South Carolina and the transmitter is in Columbia northeast of downtown. History 103.1 FM was allocated to Columbia beginning in 1976. The construction permit for the 3 kW. station was awarded in June of that year to MIDCOM Corporation, a group made up of Rev. I. DeQuincey Newman, J.E. Dickson, Bob Parnell, & Bob Cook. Construction for the station was held up for several years by appeals filed by Nuance Corp, the owners of crosstown AM Urban Contemporary outlet WOIC and one of the dismissed applicants for the proposed FM.\\"New FM Radio Station Gets Approval For Construction\\", Columbia Record, October 5, 1981. Eventually, the FCC sided with a lower court, approving the station to be licensed to MIDCOM in October 1981. Finally in 1982, the station hit the air as WDPN with an Urban Contemporary and Jazz music format with its studios and tower located in the Columbia suburb of Dentsville. Ratings for the new outlet were at a 4.2 in its first Arbitron ratings period.\\"WCOS Top In Radio Ratings, Newcomer WPDN Scores Well\\", The State, January 25, 1983. However, the station was overshadowed not only by the well-established WOIC, but competition from Sumter-based FM Urban Contemporary outlet WWDM, which became the dominant Urban outlet in the market. By 1985, WDPN was acquired by WOIC's parent company, Nuance Corporation and WDPN's studios were moved into WOIC's facility at 910 Comanche Trail in West Columbia. Ratings for both stations began to decline. In early 1986, both WPDN and WOIC were acquired by Alpha Communications. a group headed up by legendary air personality Chuck Dunaway (of WABC and KLIF fame). WOIC was left Urban, while WDPM changed to Top 40/Crossover as \\"C-103\\" under the new call letters of WMMC. Almost overnight, the station's ratings increased. By early 1987, the station had evolved more toward a mainstream CHR format. By early 1988, what gains that C-103 had made were slowly being eroded by rival CHRs WNOK and new upstart WYYS (now WLTY). The station was sold to Price Broadcasting, which changed the station's call letters to WPRH and the handle to \\"Power 103\\" on May 2, but kept the previous Top 40 format. This move did not work as the station's ratings spiraled downward within a year's time. On April 15, 1989, after a week where the station experimented with a brief Album Rock format, Magic 103.1 was born, taking the new call letters of WOMG. This was the market's first FM Oldies station since WWGO's (now WMFX) attempt 3 years prior (WODE, now known as WPCO), was doing Oldies on AM during this time, but would change formats by the end of the year). At the start, Magic 103.1 was more focused on music from 1956 through 1968, but as time moved on, music from the 1970s were added into the format as well. In February 1991, after the station had experienced a significant dip in the ratings, the station reimaged itself as Oldies 103, focusing on the music from 1964 to 1973. The basic format has remained ever since, although in recent years, music from the late 70s was re-added into the format. In 1997, after years of planning and delays, the station was finally able to increase its power from 3 kW. to 6 kW.. This move solidified its signal coverage in the Columbia metro area. However, even with its new wattage, and Gamecock Basketball and Baseball rights, the station's power makes it inaccessible to western Lexington County, into Calhoun and Orangeburg; WQKI-FM in Rowesville, South Carolina blocks its signals. Those complaints led to Citadel Broadcasting moving the WNKT tower from St. George to Eastover, changing its market, and flipping that station to a sports station in order to carry Gamecock sports to a more accessible area. On April 1, 2008, Citadel Broadcasting moved the urban contemporary format from 98.5 FM to 103.1 FM. The Oldies format then heard on 103.1 FM moved to 98.5 FM, along with the WOMG calls.

Origin  The original Clouser Deep Minnow evolved from traditional bucktail streamers and was created in 1987 by Bob Clouser, a Pennsylvania fly shop owner and guide. The original patterns were intended for smallmouth bass on the Susquehanna River. The name Clouser Deep Minnow was coined by Lefty Kreh, a noted Fly Fishing writer in a 1989 article in Fly Fisherman. Today, the Clouser Deep Minnow is widely used for many species of both fresh and saltwater game fish. Lefty Kreh claims to have caught over 87 species of game fish on Clouser Deep Minnow flies.  Imitates  The Clouser Deep Minnow is an imitation of a baitfish, although there are many variations intended to imitate very specific baitfish in different fresh and saltwater situations.

It formed an important link between the Merovingian Frankish Empire and the southern Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Kent and East Anglia. History The abbey was founded in about 620 by Burgundofara (Saint Fara), the first abbess. It was a double monastery, the first in France, with communities of both monks and nuns. It was established to follow the strict Rule of Saint Columbanus. The site, an estate belonging to Fara's family, originally known as Evoriacum, was renamed Faremoutiers (\\"Fara's monastery\\") in her honour. The modern village of Faremoutiers grew up around the abbey. In the 9th century, as all French abbeys were commanded to do by Louis the Pious, it changed to the Rule of Saint Benedict. In 1140 it was destroyed by fire. In 1445, at the end of the Hundred Years' War, it was pillaged by soldiers. In the 16th and 17th centuries the abbey enjoyed royal favour, but was later tainted by Jansenism, and in the 18th century suffered from an exhausting lawsuit with the bishop of Meaux and continuing economic problems. It was suppressed during the French Revolution. Until 1796 the premises were used as a barracks and thereafter as a quarry. Re-foundation In 1930 Benedictine nuns, living nearby at Amillis, founded a small community on the site of Faremoutier abbey, which remains to this day.

Smalltalk MT adopts a different approach in that the Smalltalk source is compiled to machine code before being executed. This allows the developer the freedom of working with compiled code without the need for the traditional compile-link-run cycle. This is like a specialized form of incremental or dynamic compilation. Smalltalk MT directly interfaces to DLLs in exactly the same manner as C which allows DLL calls to be tested directly in a Workspace, which allows a scripting style of approach to accessing any DLL based code. For example, one could write in a Workspace the following (single line or multiline, breaking on the '.' character) to reverse the string 'abc': a := 'abc'. WINAPI _strrev: a. a inspect. For 64-bit Windows https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime- library/reference/strrev-wcsrev-mbsrev-mbsrev-l?view=vs-2017, try: a:= 'abc'. WINAPI _wcsrev: a. a inspect. The WINAPI call directly calls the DLL function _strrev natively passing parameters from the Smalltalk environment to the C environment and back. Smalltalk MT has a close integration with COM objects and fully compiled COM components can be created that operate in exactly the same way as C/C++ COM objects. In 1998 David Anderson teamed up with Tarik Kerroum to advance Smalltalk MT into the high performance and graphics areas.

Because of the Naveed cover, Saul Fox is best known for being \\"The Birdman\\". The chorus of the song originates from an early demo that the band cut in 1992 called \\"Nobody's Wrong\\" with a completely different meaning. Release The Birdman is the first single released by Our Lady Peace, and only in Canada, on January 17, 1994. It was considered to be the least accessible track off Naveed and was chosen to be the first single for that reason. According to Catherine McRae, manager of domestic marketing and artist development for Sony Music Canada, \\"We deliberately chose a single which wasn't an immediate, commercial, hit-radio single and then serviced it specifically first to campus radio to build a street buzz on the band.\\"LeBlanc, Larry. \\"Our Lady Peace jumps Canadian border. \\" Billboard 25 Feb. 1995: JuniorQuest Magazines, ProQuest. Web. Retrieved 28 Sep. 2010. Raine Maida admitted that he knew \\"The Birdman\\" wouldn't do well at radio. He said in an interview with Billboard in 1995, \\"What it did was allow us three months to tour with other bands and get better. Now we're all confident about our live show. We're not intimidated by playing with anybody.\\" Meaning The song is about a man that lead singer and lyricist Raine Maida once saw on the street. The Birdman was the nickname of convicted killer, Robert Stroud who was imprisoned at Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary for 17 years. \\"I assumed he was some kind of politician that lost it and was living on the streets and just going nuts all night. It was strange; I just caught a few words as I passed by him, and he was one of the most intelligent people I have ever heard speak. Right then I had this enlightenment. I did not give him a chance and there are probably times where you miss opportunities because you form opinions so quickly.\\" - Raine Maida \\"I was in Kansas city a while back and there was this man on the street. I was in my hotel room and I couldn't sleep ‚Äòcause this guy was just yelling through a megaphone and he was yelling about a bunch of propaganda and stuff but the next day when I went down from the hotel and he was outside still. I had a chance to pass by, read his booklet and stuff and I heard him talking to some other people and the song encompasses the thing where it's kinda like a serial killer where on the surface he's just a ruthless, kinda no conscience, no remorse killer but underneath the serial killer there's obviously a really intelligent, very calculating kind of person and that's is what I wanted to get in the lyrics of the song. There's so many different ways and so many different perspectives to look at somebody.This thing, the birdman is just that in itself, that there's always something deeper when you look into it.\\" -Raine Maida Music video The band chose Floria Sigismondi to direct \\"The Birdman\\" video after, according to Maida, the first unidentified director they chose pitched an idea that was completely irrelevant to the song. Maida later witnessed the same idea used for another artist's video by that director. Sigismondi's video is set against a sunset backdrop and stars Saul Fox as the bird man as well as the members of the band. Saul appears at various times in the video parading around a nest wearing a birdcage on his head, wearing a fake beak and wearing wings as well as having corresponding scars on his back while the band plays on. The video ends with Raine Maida going insane and kicking around the bird nest before the video fades out. The video version of the song is edited so that it fades out before the actual ending.

So far they have released six studio albums, a collection boxset and a live record. Members * Kutxi Romero: lead vocals and lyrics * Eduardo Beaumont (Pi√±as): bass and vocals (occasionally). * C√©sar Ramallo: electric guitar * David Kolibr√≠ D√≠az: electric and acoustic guitar * Al√©n Ayerdi: drums and backing vocals History In 1997, after having been a member of 9 different punk bands, Kutxi Romero decided to form a rock group. He called Alen Ayerdi - former drummer of Begira - who didn't hesitate to join Kutxi's project. He then contacted Edu Beaumont \\"Pi√±as\\", whom he had met one year before. Pi√±as hadn't played previously in any other band, but Kutxi - who was a very good friend of his - persuaded him to join as bassist. Pi√±as accepted and introduced Kutxi to C√©sar Ramallo, who would become one of Marea's guitarists. David D√≠az, aka Kolibr√≠, also a guitarist, also joined the band. The band was initially called \\"La Patera\\" but as a band with the same name already existed they adopted the name Marea, that was supposed to be the title of their first album that they instead named La Patera. BMG expressed an interest in their first album and in 1999 they became Marea's first label. Their first album was released all across Spain. In 2000, due to problems with BMG they left them to join GOR. That year they released their second album: Revolc√≥n. A year later, on 2001, they began having conflicts with GOR and they ended their contract with them. They signed a new one with Dro Records. They began working on their 3rd album, Besos de perro. Besos de Perro was released in 2002. After having played live about 200 times in approximately 3 years, they decided to take a little break from their music career and stopped touring to work on their following album. In 2004, they released their fourth album, 28000 Pu√±aladas. They began touring until 2005. Kutxi Romero announced in 2006 that Marea were working on their fifth album, Las aceras est√°n llenas de piojos, which was released in 2007. Also in 2007, Marea released the boxset Coces al aire 1997-2007. It includes a CD featuring 18 of their best songs (Coces al aire), one with previously unreleased songs and alternate versions (Jaur√≠as de perros verdes), 2 DVDs - one with all their videos and some live recording and one including a whole live concert, a picture book and a biography of the band written by the journalist J. √ìscar Beorlegui.

It was sold to Qwest in 1998. EUnet played a decisive role in the adoption of TCP/IP in Europe beginning in 1988.  History  The roots of EUnet, originally an abbreviation for European UNIX Network, go back to 1982 under the auspices of the EUUG (European UNIX Users Group) (later EurOpen) and the first international UUCP connections.http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/613/534 On the Early Days of Usenet, the roots of the online cooperative culture FNET was the French branch of EUnet. Once there was a central European backbone node that was separate from the expensive telecom network, TCP/IP was adopted in place of store and forward. This enabled EUnet to connect with NSFNET and CERN‚Äôs TCP/IP connections. A connection to the US was also established. On January 1, 1990 EUnet began selling Internet access to non-academic customers in the Netherlands, making them one of the first companies to sell Internet access to the general public. EUnet provided local service through a respective national EUnet business partner in many European countries. In 1990 the Soviet IP-based network RELCOM mostly operated by DEMOS powered computers was connected to the EUnet. In April 1998 the company together with nearly all of the national European business partners of EUnet was sold to Qwest Communications International,https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB890869756866767500\\" Qwest to Buy Internet Provider EUnet of Europe for $154 Million which in turn later merged EUnet into the illfated joint-venture KPNQwest.https://www.fiberopticsonline.com/doc/kpn-and-qwest-form-700-million- european-fiber-0001 KPN and Qwest Form $700 Million European Fiber Network Team In year 2000 it was estimated that KPNQwest was carrying more than 50% of European IP traffic.KPNQwest hat sein Netz abgeschaltet, heise.de, July 24, 2002. Some of the ISPs operating under the name EUnet today can be traced back to the original EUnet, some not. Most national EUnet affiliates or subsidiaries predated other commercial Internet offerings in the respective countries by many years. To completely understand the importance and history of EUnet, it is important to realize that until the early 1990s nearly every European country had a telecommunications monopoly with an incumbent national PTT, and that commercial and non-commercial provision of telecommunications services was prohibited or at least took place in a legal \\"grey zone\\". During the same period, as part of an industrial political strategy to stop US domination of future network technology, the EC embarked on efforts to promote OSI protocols, founding for example RARE and associated national \\"research\\" network operators (DFN, SURFnet, SWITCH to name a few).

He carved a number of totem poles which are on public display in Canada and internationally. Early life He was born in 1923 in the Kwakwaka'wakw community of Fort Rupert, B.C. He was a descendant of the renowned ethnologist George Hunt. In 1954 he moved to Victoria and became Martin‚Äôs chief assistant in the Thunderbird Park carving program. Hunt was originally a logger and fishermen before he took up wood carving professionally. In 1939 he married Helen Martin, the adopted daughter of Kwakwaka'wakw artist Mungo Martin. Their children were the artists Henry, Jr., Shirley Ford, Tony Hunt, Richard Hunt, and Stanley C. Hunt. Career In 1954 Hunt went to work for his father-in-law in Victoria. Hunt took the post of Martin's chief assistant in the Thunderbird Park at the British Columbia Provincial Museum. At Thunderbird Park, Hunt studied traditional wood carving under Mungo Martin and Arthur Shaughnessy. He also worked in the museum's collections. helping to restore and preserve Aboriginal art. Mungo Martin died in 1962 and Hunt succeeded him as he park‚Äôs Master Carver. Henry Hunt trained his sons, Tony, Stanley and Richard, in the art of carving; all of them went on to establish careers as carvers. Tony became chief assistant carver to his father and together they created a series of important totem poles and other carvings. Henry Hunt remained at the museum for over 20 years until he retired in 1974, and his son Richard took over as Master Carver in the Thunderbird Park carving program. Works Hunt's totem pole at the Expo67 \\"Indians of Canada\\" Pavilion Henry Hunt followed the Kwakwaka'wakw carving tradition, using minimum paint, deep cuts with traditional tools. A number of Hunt's works can be seen at locations around Canada. Many of his totem poles and other ornamental objects can be seen on display at the Thunderbird Park in Victoria. He produced a totem pole for the Indians of Canada Pavilion at Expo67 in Montreal, and a pole for the Totem Marina at Shuswap Lake, BC. A noted work by Henry and Richard Hunt is a memorial pole which was erected in 1970 in memory of Mungo Martin at Alert Bay. This pole is reputedly the world's tallest totem pole, standing at ; the previous claim to the title was a pole carved by Henry Hunt, Mungo and David Martin standing at Beacon Hill Park in Victoria, depicting the legend of Geeksen, the first man in Kwakwaka'wakw mythology. Another of Hunt's poles stands at the Swartz Bay ferry terminal; this pole depicts the Kwakwaka'wakw mythological figures of Grizzly Bear and the Whale, and was awarded first prize in the Route of the Totems contest. Other works by Hunt can be seen in Victoria, at Victoria Harbour and in the entrance of the Royal British Columbia Museum in Victoria; at the Maritime Museum of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC; at the Museum of Anthropology at UBC, Vancouver; and in Confederation Park, Ottawa, ON. Hunt produced many smaller works including small presentation poles (approximately 45 cm long) which were presented as gifts to visiting heads of state and dignitaries; recipients have included prime minister Lester Pearson, US President Lyndon B. Johnson and Queen Elizabeth II. Several of his works have been exhibited internationally.

It was originally released in 1988 through Swordfish Records and later saw several reissues on Earache Records with two additional songs. An unexpected underground success, the eponymous EP made it onto the UK Indie Chart and peaked at position 20. Though not supported by any singles or music videos at the time, a fan-made video for \\"Avalanche Master Song\\" has since been made official by the band. Godflesh was recorded and produced over two months in Birmingham by frontman Justin Broadrick and bassist G. C. Green, both of who had played together in an early version of the band known as Fall of Because. Despite often being overshadowed by the critical success of Godflesh's first full-length studio album, 1989's Streetcleaner, the EP was one of the first industrial metal releases and helped define the genre's sound with programmed drum beats, heavy metal guitar and unusual emphasis on bass. Its and the band's title strive to reconcile the potentially deep and meaningful impact music has on people with its harsher, more physical side. Background Fall of Because, the band that would eventually become Godflesh, temporarily dissolved in 1987 when Justin Broadrick left to drum for the English experimental group Head of David. After only six weeks with that band, Broadrick was fired for being, according to him, \\"too noisy\\" of a drummer. In April 1988, he and Fall of Because bassist G. C. Green reformed their project under the name Godflesh and set to work on a self-titled EP, which would be recorded in June and July of the same year at a studio in Birmingham; Broadrick and Green undertook production duties themselves. Crucially, it was in this reunion that Broadrick shifted from acoustic drums to vocals and guitar and that the percussion was instead programmed on an Alesis HR-16 drum machine. The decision to employ stiff, mechanical beats rather than a traditional human drummer would prove pivotal for Godflesh and industrial metal at large. About the title of the EP and of the band at large, Broadrick said, \\"I heard someone once say that music is the voice of God. The word 'God' conjures something immense and inconceivable. The 'flesh' part is what effects you on a physical level. Our music is loud and destructive.\\" Composition As one of the first releases to merge the genres of industrial and metal, the music of Godflesh is defined by its programmed drumming, Broadrick's low guitar and growls and Green's pummelling bass. The EP's sound, informed by Swans, Big Black, Killing Joke and Throbbing Gristle, is notably heavy and slow, built upon the deliberately repetitive pounding of the drum machine. Simon Turner of Melody Maker highlighted the EP's discipline and restraint as its greatest asset, praising its so-called \\"cruelty of denial\\". The songs are often glacially paced, focusing on exploring chords through repetition, and Broadrick's vocals (either screamed or wailed) are sparse. Martin Walters of AllMusic described the guitar as \\"explosive\\", and Jason Birchmeier of the same publication called the tempo \\"lumbering\\". Alternative Press Jason Pettigrew characterised the EP as \\"oppressive and brutal\\". Unlike many metal releases with guttural vocals and downtuned instruments, the EP's tone is not overtly masculine. About this subject, Melody Maker's Simon Reynolds described Godflesh as \\"terminal\\", or at the end of musical development, writing, \\"Rather than feminise themselves, they'd rather their masculinity was defeated, their strong bodies crushed and pulverised.\\" Broadrick has often noted this himself, referring to the band as defensive instead of offensive. When asked directly about the topic in 1990, he answered, \\"We despise the celebration of male ego that comes with most metal. It's pathetic; all these guys with their penis extension guitars just make us laugh.\\" Release Godflesh was released in 1988 through the independent label Swordfish Records. Distributed only on vinyl at first, the EP was a surprise underground hit that reached position 20 on the UK Indie Chart; Digby Pearson of Earache Records took notice and acquired Godflesh, promising them wider circulation since Swordfish could not fulfil international demand. In 1990, a year after the acquisition, Godflesh was reissued on CD with two bonus tracks. These songs, \\"Wounds\\" and \\"Streetcleaner 2\\", were in-house remixes of songs from the band's debut full-length album and first release on Earache, Streetcleaner (1989). Godflesh was remastered and again reissued in 2014, this time as a gatefold double LP. On all versions of the EP, the cover artwork was taken from the 1966 John Frankenheimer film Seconds. A still frame from the video for \\"Avalanche Master Song\\" that depicts religious imagery typical to Godflesh \\"Avalanche Master Song\\", the EP's introduction and a track that MetalSucks described as a \\"classic\\", is one of few Godflesh songs accompanied with a music video. Directed by three fans of the band (Jack Sargent, Julian Weaver and Stephanie Watson) who had followed Broadrick since his days drumming with Head of David, the video comprises bootleg recordings of early Godflesh concerts. Some of the footage is from the band's first public show in Brixton, London. Interspersed among performance clips are brief shots of Christian iconography, something typical to Godflesh. This video was officially released for the first time in 2001 on the compilation In All Languages. The title \\"Avalanche Master Song\\" is derived from two Leonard Cohen songs, \\"Avalanche\\" and \\"Master Song\\" from 1971 and 1967 respectively. =Critical reception and legacy= Godflesh received positive reviews, but it was mostly overshadowed by the band's later releases. Martin Walters of AllMusic called the EP \\"one of the most influential recordings in the industrial metal scene\\", but suggested that new fans should listen to Streetcleaner, Slavestate (1991) or Pure (1992) first. Walters went on to describe the EP as \\"pioneering\\" and said that it \\"undeniably marked a high point in avant metal\\". Also from AllMusic, Greg Prato said Godflesh helped \\"pave the way for countless copycat acts\\", and Jonathan Gold of the Los Angeles Times suggested that the EP influenced the sound of many metal groups, especially Ministry. Melody Maker published three discrete reviews of Godflesh from 1988 to 1990, each from different authors. In the first, Simon Turner praised the EP's focus on a drum machine as well as Broadrick's \\"huge but overawed\\" vocals. Turner appreciated the vulnerability of the music contrasted against its harshness and weight. In 1989, an author credited as 'P.O.' favorably contrasted Godflesh against then-current music trends, expressing a struggle to find what genre the band fit into. In 1990, Simon Reynolds reviewed the Earache reissue of Godflesh, admiring its extreme weight and blend of diverse influences. Since the late 1980s and early 1990s, Godflesh's reputation has grown and critics have retrospectively looked at their debut EP in a favorable light; Joe DiVita of Loudwire called Godflesh one of the \\"most exciting releases ever in heavy metal\\" and in their book The New Metal Masters, H. P. Newquist and Rich Maloof wrote that Godflesh was, at the time, the most ominous and malevolent music in existence. BraveWords called the EP \\"genre-defining\\".

Given a large enough pool of variables for the same time period, it is possible to find a pair of graphs that show a correlation with no causation. In statistics, the multiple comparisons, multiplicity or multiple testing problem occurs when one considers a set of statistical inferences simultaneously or infers a subset of parameters selected based on the observed values. In certain fields it is known as the look-elsewhere effect. The more inferences are made, the more likely erroneous inferences are to occur. Several statistical techniques have been developed to prevent this from happening, allowing significance levels for single and multiple comparisons to be directly compared. These techniques generally require a stricter significance threshold for individual comparisons, so as to compensate for the number of inferences being made. History The interest in the problem of multiple comparisons began in the 1950s with the work of Tukey and Scheff√©. Other methods, such as the closed testing procedure (Marcus et al., 1976) and the Holm‚ÄìBonferroni method (1979), later emerged. In 1995, work on the false discovery rate began. In 1996, the first conference on multiple comparisons took place in Israel. This was followed by conferences around the world, usually taking place about every two years. Definition Multiple comparisons arise when a statistical analysis involves multiple simultaneous statistical tests, each of which has a potential to produce a \\"discovery\\", of the same dataset or dependent datasets. A stated confidence level generally applies only to each test considered individually, but often it is desirable to have a confidence level for the whole family of simultaneous tests. Failure to compensate for multiple comparisons can have important real-world consequences, as illustrated by the following examples: * Suppose the treatment is a new way of teaching writing to students, and the control is the standard way of teaching writing. Students in the two groups can be compared in terms of grammar, spelling, organization, content, and so on. As more attributes are compared, it becomes increasingly likely that the treatment and control groups will appear to differ on at least one attribute due to random sampling error alone. * Suppose we consider the efficacy of a drug in terms of the reduction of any one of a number of disease symptoms. As more symptoms are considered, it becomes increasingly likely that the drug will appear to be an improvement over existing drugs in terms of at least one symptom. In both examples, as the number of comparisons increases, it becomes more likely that the groups being compared will appear to differ in terms of at least one attribute. Our confidence that a result will generalize to independent data should generally be weaker if it is observed as part of an analysis that involves multiple comparisons, rather than an analysis that involves only a single comparison. For example, if one test is performed at the 5% level and the corresponding null hypothesis is true, there is only a 5% chance of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis. However, if 100 tests are conducted and all corresponding null hypotheses are true, the expected number of incorrect rejections (also known as false positives or Type I errors) is 5. If the tests are statistically independent from each other, the probability of at least one incorrect rejection is 99.4%. Note that of course the multiple comparisons problem arises not in every situation where several hypotheses are empirically tested, be that sequentially or in parallel (concurrent); roughly speaking, the multiple comparisons problem arises whenever multiple hypotheses are tested on the same dataset (or datasets that are not independent) or whenever one and the same hypothesis is tested in several datasets. The multiple comparisons problem also applies to confidence intervals. A single confidence interval with a 95% coverage probability level will contain the population parameter in 95% of experiments. However, if one considers 100 confidence intervals simultaneously, each with 95% coverage probability, the expected number of non-covering intervals is 5. If the intervals are statistically independent from each other, the probability that at least one interval does not contain the population parameter is 99.4%. Techniques have been developed to prevent the inflation of false positive rates and non- coverage rates that occur with multiple statistical tests. =Classification of multiple hypothesis tests= Controlling procedures If m independent comparisons are performed, the family-wise error rate (FWER), is given by : \\\\bar{\\\\alpha} = 1-\\\\left( 1-\\\\alpha_{\\\\\\\\{\\\\text{per comparison}\\\\\\\\}} \\\\right)^m. Hence, unless the tests are perfectly positively dependent (i.e., identical), \\\\bar{\\\\alpha} increases as the number of comparisons increases. If we do not assume that the comparisons are independent, then we can still say: : \\\\bar{\\\\alpha} \\\\le m \\\\cdot \\\\alpha_{\\\\\\\\{\\\\text{per comparison}\\\\\\\\}}, which follows from Boole's inequality. Example: 0.2649=1-(1-.05)^6 \\\\le .05 \\\\times 6 = 0.3 There are different ways to assure that the family-wise error rate is at most \\\\bar{\\\\alpha}. The most conservative method, which is free of dependence and distributional assumptions, is the Bonferroni correction \\\\alpha_\\\\mathrm{\\\\\\\\{per\\\\ comparison\\\\\\\\}}={\\\\alpha}/m. A marginally less conservative correction can be obtained by solving the equation for the family-wise error rate of m independent comparisons for \\\\alpha_\\\\mathrm{\\\\\\\\{per\\\\ comparison\\\\\\\\}}. This yields \\\\alpha_{\\\\\\\\{\\\\text{per comparison}\\\\\\\\}} = 1-{(1-{\\\\alpha})}^{1/m}, which is known as the ≈†id√°k correction. Another procedure is the Holm‚ÄìBonferroni method, which uniformly delivers more power than the simple Bonferroni correction, by testing only the lowest p-value (i=1) against the strictest criterion, and the higher p-values (i>1) against progressively less strict criteria. \\\\alpha_\\\\mathrm{\\\\\\\\{per\\\\ comparison\\\\\\\\}}={\\\\alpha}/(m-i+1). For continuous problems, one can employ Bayesian logic to compute m from the prior-to-posterior volume ratio. Continuous generalizations of the Bonferroni and ≈†id√°k correction are presented in . Multiple testing correction refers to re-calculating probabilities obtained from a statistical test which was repeated multiple times. In order to retain a prescribed family-wise error rate Œ± in an analysis involving more than one comparison, the error rate for each comparison must be more stringent than Œ±. Boole's inequality implies that if each of m tests is performed to have type I error rate Œ±/m, the total error rate will not exceed Œ±. This is called the Bonferroni correction, and is one of the most commonly used approaches for multiple comparisons. In some situations, the Bonferroni correction is substantially conservative, i.e., the actual family-wise error rate is much less than the prescribed level Œ±. This occurs when the test statistics are highly dependent (in the extreme case where the tests are perfectly dependent, the family-wise error rate with no multiple comparisons adjustment and the per-test error rates are identical). For example, in fMRI analysis, tests are done on over 100,000 voxels in the brain. The Bonferroni method would require p-values to be smaller than .05/100000 to declare significance. Since adjacent voxels tend to be highly correlated, this threshold is generally too stringent. Because simple techniques such as the Bonferroni method can be conservative, there has been a great deal of attention paid to developing better techniques, such that the overall rate of false positives can be maintained without excessively inflating the rate of false negatives. Such methods can be divided into general categories: *Methods where total alpha can be proved to never exceed 0.05 (or some other chosen value) under any conditions. These methods provide \\"strong\\" control against Type I error, in all conditions including a partially correct null hypothesis. *Methods where total alpha can be proved not to exceed 0.05 except under certain defined conditions. *Methods which rely on an omnibus test before proceeding to multiple comparisons. Typically these methods require a significant ANOVA, MANOVA, or Tukey's range test. These methods generally provide only \\"weak\\" control of Type I error, except for certain numbers of hypotheses. *Empirical methods, which control the proportion of Type I errors adaptively, utilizing correlation and distribution characteristics of the observed data. The advent of computerized resampling methods, such as bootstrapping and Monte Carlo simulations, has given rise to many techniques in the latter category. In some cases where exhaustive permutation resampling is performed, these tests provide exact, strong control of Type I error rates; in other cases, such as bootstrap sampling, they provide only approximate control. Large-scale multiple testing Traditional methods for multiple comparisons adjustments focus on correcting for modest numbers of comparisons, often in an analysis of variance. A different set of techniques have been developed for \\"large-scale multiple testing\\", in which thousands or even greater numbers of tests are performed. For example, in genomics, when using technologies such as microarrays, expression levels of tens of thousands of genes can be measured, and genotypes for millions of genetic markers can be measured. Particularly in the field of genetic association studies, there has been a serious problem with non-replication ‚Äî a result being strongly statistically significant in one study but failing to be replicated in a follow-up study. Such non-replication can have many causes, but it is widely considered that failure to fully account for the consequences of making multiple comparisons is one of the causes. In different branches of science, multiple testing is handled in different ways. It has been argued that if statistical tests are only performed when there is a strong basis for expecting the result to be true, multiple comparisons adjustments are not necessary. It has also been argued that use of multiple testing corrections is an inefficient way to perform empirical research, since multiple testing adjustments control false positives at the potential expense of many more false negatives. On the other hand, it has been argued that advances in measurement and information technology have made it far easier to generate large datasets for exploratory analysis, often leading to the testing of large numbers of hypotheses with no prior basis for expecting many of the hypotheses to be true. In this situation, very high false positive rates are expected unless multiple comparisons adjustments are made. For large-scale testing problems where the goal is to provide definitive results, the familywise error rate remains the most accepted parameter for ascribing significance levels to statistical tests. Alternatively, if a study is viewed as exploratory, or if significant results can be easily re-tested in an independent study, control of the false discovery rate (FDR) is often preferred. The FDR, loosely defined as the expected proportion of false positives among all significant tests, allows researchers to identify a set of \\"candidate positives\\" that can be more rigorously evaluated in a follow-up study. The practice of trying many unadjusted comparisons in the hope of finding a significant one is a known problem, whether applied unintentionally or deliberately, is sometimes called \\"p-hacking.\\" =Assessing whether any alternative hypotheses are true= normal quantile plot for a simulated set of test statistics that have been standardized to be Z-scores under the null hypothesis. The departure of the upper tail of the distribution from the expected trend along the diagonal is due to the presence of substantially more large test statistic values than would be expected if all null hypotheses were true. The red point corresponds to the fourth largest observed test statistic, which is 3.13, versus an expected value of 2.06. The blue point corresponds to the fifth smallest test statistic, which is -1.75, versus an expected value of -1.96. The graph suggests that it is unlikely that all the null hypotheses are true, and that most or all instances of a true alternative hypothesis result from deviations in the positive direction. A basic question faced at the outset of analyzing a large set of testing results is whether there is evidence that any of the alternative hypotheses are true. One simple meta-test that can be applied when it is assumed that the tests are independent of each other is to use the Poisson distribution as a model for the number of significant results at a given level Œ± that would be found when all null hypotheses are true. If the observed number of positives is substantially greater than what should be expected, this suggests that there are likely to be some true positives among the significant results. For example, if 1000 independent tests are performed, each at level Œ± = 0.05, we expect 0.05 √ó 1000 = 50 significant tests to occur when all null hypotheses are true. Based on the Poisson distribution with mean 50, the probability of observing more than 61 significant tests is less than 0.05, so if more than 61 significant results are observed, it is very likely that some of them correspond to situations where the alternative hypothesis holds. A drawback of this approach is that it over-states the evidence that some of the alternative hypotheses are true when the test statistics are positively correlated, which commonly occurs in practice. . On the other hand, the approach remains valid even in the presence of correlation among the test statistics, as long as the Poisson distribution can be shown to provide a good approximation for the number of significant results. This scenario arises, for instance, when mining significant frequent itemsets from transactional datasets. Furthermore, a careful two stage analysis can bound the FDR at a pre-specified level. Another common approach that can be used in situations where the test statistics can be standardized to Z-scores is to make a normal quantile plot of the test statistics. If the observed quantiles are markedly more dispersed than the normal quantiles, this suggests that some of the significant results may be true positives.

Chen Yin was the first son of his father Chen Shubao, who was crown prince under Chen Yin's grandfather Emperor Xuan at the time of Chen Yin's birth. Chen Yin's mother Consort Sun died in childbirth, and Chen Shubao's wife Crown Princess Shen Wuhua, mournful of her death, took Chen Yin and raised him as her own son. As Chen Shubao was already 20 at the time of Chen Yin's birth‚Äîa relatively late age to have a son in those times‚ÄîEmperor Xuan had Chen Shubao designate Chen Yin as his heir even though Chen Yin was not born of Crown Princess Shen, and further awarded a bowl of wine to each father in the realm. In 578, he was created the Duke of Yongkang. In 582, Emperor Xuan died, and Chen Shubao, after surviving a coup attempt, became emperor. He created Chen Yin's adoptive mother Crown Princess Shen empress and Chen Yin crown prince. Chen Shubao selected the daughter of the general Xiao Mohe to be Chen Yin's wife and crown princess. Chen Yin was said to be intelligent and studious, but also often making mistakes. When his chief of staff Yuan Xian () urged him to change his ways, he would not accept Yuan's suggestion. Meanwhile, Empress Shen was not favored by Chen Shubao, whose favorite concubines were Consort Zhang Lihua and Consort Kong. As Empress Shen and Chen Yin often exchanged messengers, Chen Shubao suspected that Chen Yin despised him for not favoring Empress Shen. Consorts Zhang and Kong, assisted by the high-level official Kong Fan (Â≠îÁØÑ, who, although he was not related to Consort Kong, referred to her as his sister), began to make accusations against Chen Yin before Chen Shubao. In 588, Chen Shubao thus decided to depose Chen Yin and make Consort Zhang's son Chen Yuan the Prince of Shi'an crown prince, despite Yuan's opposition. In summer 588, he deposed Chen Yin and demoted him to the title of Prince of Wuxing, creating Chen Yuan crown prince instead. Chen Shubao then considered deposing Empress Shen as well and replacing her with Consort Zhang, but as rival Sui Dynasty captured the Chen capital Jiankang in 589, ending Chen and unifying China, that did not occur. Chen Shubao was taken to the Sui capital Chang'an and treated as an honored guest of Emperor Wen of Sui, and Chen Yin followed his father to Chang'an. He died there, but there is no historical record of the year of his death. Unlike many of his brothers, there was also no record that he served as an official to Sui, so he probably died fairly early.

Written by Tony Barwick and Shane Rimmer and directed by Alan Perry, it was first broadcast on 16 April 1968 on ATV Midlands. In this episode, the Mysterons destroy and reconstruct a spacecraft to attack a desalination facility in the Andes mountains. Plot While tracking down space debris, the Euro-Space recovery vehicle SKR4 is destroyed by a meteoroid impact. Informing ground control that the crew are abandoning their mission due to a technical fault, a Mysteron reconstruction of SKR4 reverses course for Earth. On Cloudbase, Spectrum learns the target of the Mysterons' latest threat: the Najama complex, an automated facility in the Andes that desalinates seawater to irrigate the interior of South America. Colonel White (voiced by Donald Gray) dispatches a team of field agents, led by Captains Scarlet and Blue (voiced by Francis Matthews and Ed Bishop) and accompanied by the Angel squadron, to the Najama Valley to set up surveillance posts around the complex. Shortly after Spectrum's arrival, Captain Black slips into the ancient Aztec temple where Scarlet and Blue are based and conceals a radio transmitter in the mouth of a statue of the Sun God. Meanwhile, Euro Tracker station is monitoring SKR4's return journey to Earth. When attempts to contact the spacecraft fail, a concerned Major Moran alerts Cloudbase. Transmissions between Euro Tracker and SKR4 are jammed by an external radio signal that is drawing the spacecraft off-course to a new landing site in the Najama area. White deduces that SKR4, which is carrying several explosives packs, is being used as a missile to strike the Najama Valley. As SKR4 enters Earth's atmosphere, Scarlet and Blue discover that the source of the signal ‚Äì the transmitter hidden by Black ‚Äì is somewhere within the temple. Realising that they cannot locate and destroy the transmitter in the time remaining, they evacuate the temple in their Spectrum Pursuit Vehicle and order the Angels to launch an aerial assault on the building. Although the statue of the Sun God is destroyed in the bombardment, Spectrum are too late to prevent SKR4 from crashing into the ruins. The impact triggers a landslide that hits the Najama complex's exposed liquid oxygen tanks and destroys the facility in a series of explosions. Scarlet and Blue acknowledge the Mysteron victory. Production \\"Inferno\\" was filmed in late 1967.Bentley 2017, p. 183. The SKR4 miniature model was based on the design of the TVR-17 satellite from the episode \\"White as Snow\\". The puppet playing the SKR4 navigator does not appear in any other episodes of Captain Scarlet.Bentley 2017, p. 167. Most of the episode's incidental music consists of cues recycled from older Supermarionation productions: seven earlier episodes of Captain Scarlet as well as six episodes of Thunderbirds and three of Supercar. \\"Inferno\\" features the third appearance of the Mysterons' vanishing power, previously seen in \\"The Heart of New York\\" and \\"Model Spy\\". Reception \\"Inferno\\" is regarded as the best episode of Captain Scarlet by TV Zone magazine, which praises the episode's \\"dark direction and straightforwardly effective plot\\". \\"Little touches\\" ‚Äì such as the realism of Black's cautious ascent of the Sun God statue, and Scarlet and Blue being on first-name terms (making them \\"real people, with real names and lives behind their codenames\\") ‚Äì are also positively received. What is most to the episode's credit, argues the magazine, is its downbeat ending, which is aggravated by the fact that \\"Spectrum's efforts actually make it worse\\". James Stansfield of website Den of Geek ranks \\"Inferno\\" sixth in his \\"Top 10\\" list of Captain Scarlet episodes, praising its \\"horror movie-style elements\\" and describing the episode overall as \\"tremendously fun\\". Comparing Scarlet and Blue's \\"[creeping] about the temple looking for clues\\" to an episode of Scooby-Doo, he also commends the episode's use of point of view shots and \\"echoey footstep\\" sound effects, as well as its presentation of Scarlet and Blue's \\"comradeship\\". He argues that as in other episodes where the Mysterons prevail, Spectrum's defeat adds to the tension by creating an \\"'anything can happen'-type feeling\\". Commentators Chris Drake and Graeme Bassett suggest that SKR4 being under the control of an agency called Euro-Space shows that the episode's writers were \\"keen to establish the existence of a European space operation in addition to the obvious American space programme\\".

Timeframe Hassan II was king from 1961 until his death in 1999. His reign was marked by political unrest and a heavy-handed government response to criticism and opposition. Political repression increased dramatically upon Hassan's ascent to throne of the country in 1961 and this repressive political climate would last for nearly three decades. Due to strong popular mobilization from the Moroccan democracy and human rights activists and pressure from the general Moroccan population, Morocco experienced a slow but notable improvement in its political climate and human rights situation. The pace of reform accelerated with the accession to the throne of Mohammed VI in 1999. Repression and its victims Political oppression plateaued in the 1960s and wound down only in the early 1990s. During the Years of Lead, dissidents were arrested, executed, tortured, imprisoned or \\"disappeared\\", newspapers were closed and books were banned. There are few reliable lists of victims for the time, but there were hundreds of political killings and forced disappearances. Arbitrary arrests and torture affected many, including some of those outside the usual opposition networks. The reports about these human rights issues sparked domestic and international criticism. By the early 1990s, international condemnation of Morocco's poor human rights record became so strong that Hassan II had no choice but to liberate the country at least somewhat in order to avoid international isolation and tension with other countries that way Morocco would avoid becoming a pariah state. As a result, Morocco gradually became more democratic and free over time. Some examples of government repression during this period included: * Targeting of dissidents: Opposition politics was a life- threatening activity in Morocco during the low points of the Years of Lead. Harassment of dissidents was commonplace and several outspoken anti-government activists were jailed and tortured or forcibly disappeared by government forces or died mysteriously. Mehdi Ben Barka, founder of the National Union of Popular Forces (UNFP) and leader of the Tricontinental Conference which was supposed to unite anti-colonialist movements throughout the world independently of Moscow and Washington, \\"disappeared\\" in Paris in 1965. This led to the resignation of the prefect of Paris, Maurice Papon. Abraham Serfaty, for his part, was imprisoned 17 years and then exiled by Hassan II upon his liberation in September 1991. * Crackdowns on protesters: Hundreds were killed and thousands arrested in connection with demonstrations and politicized labor strikes against the government. Casualties among demonstrators occurred in the 1981 Moroccan riots and in Fes in 1990. * Purges of the army: After the attempted military coups against the king in 1971 and 1972, officers and other involved putschists were rounded up and sent to secret detention camps such as Tazmamart, where many died. Mohamed Oufkir, Hassan II's right-hand man in the 1960s, convicted in France for the assassination of Mehdi Ben Barka, was himself executed in 1972 after a failed coup attempt. Oufkir's children were imprisoned in retaliation. His daughter, Malika Oufkir, wrote a book title Stolen Lives: Twenty Years in a Desert Jail, recounting the experience. * Rif Wars: in 1958‚Äì1959, the Moroccan army fought rebellious Berber tribes in the Rif mountains that resented the Alaouite Dynasty's rule. The uprisings were harshly put down with thousands of casualties. Including these events as forming part of the \\"Years of Lead\\" would greatly increase the figures concerning victims.  ERC: Looking into the past  As the more liberal-minded Mohammed VI succeeded his father on the throne in 1999, the period was definitely over. While Morocco is still not considered a democracy in the western meaning of the term and human rights abuses still frequently occur according to rights groups (especially against suspected Islamists and Sahrawi independence seekers),http://web.amnesty.org/report2004/mar-summary-eng important reforms have been instituted to examine past abuses. The press is considerably freer than before and debate on many subjects is intense, although the monarchy, political Islam and Western Sahara remain more or less untouchable. Parliament still holds no power over the King, but elections are semi-fair, whereas they were blatantly rigged or suspended for many years during the 1970s and 1980s. Several independent human rights organizations have formed to investigate the impact of state repression during the years of rule and to press claims for damages suffered. One of the most significant developments was the setting up of the Equity and Reconciliation Commission (ERC, French acronym IER) in January 2004. The ERC is an official government human rights committee authorized to examine human rights abuses committed by the government and administer compensations for victims of unfair policies. While this is almost unprecedented in the Arab world, the ERC's actual independence from the current administration and its ability to reach culprits in the Moroccan elite, known as the \\"makhzen\\", has been seriously disputed. The ERC is not mandated to identify or prosecute discovered human rights offenders and there has been no trials against government employees for their actions during the Years of Lead. The situation in Western Sahara, a territory annexed and occupied by Morocco after the Madrid Accords in the 1970s, has been mentioned by rights groups as especially serious. There are complaints that the ERC either cannot or will not examine the cases of disappeared or killed Sahrawis with the same forcefulness as with Moroccans. On January 6, 2006, King Mohammed VI expressed regret for the human rights abuses that had occurred during his father's reign and spoke of the need for lessons to be drawn from the past. The commission's work, and the emotional legacy of the Years of Lead on four families, is also explored in the 2008 documentary film Our Forbidden Places (Nos lieux interdits).

Where ergonomics is the study of how humans react to and physically fit with machines in their environment, technostress is a result of altered habits of work and collaboration that are being brought about due to the use of modern information technologies at office and home situations. However, recent research suggests technostress also has a positive side in addition to a negative one.Califf, C. B., Sarker, S., & Sarker, S. (2020). The Bright and Dark Sides of Technostress: A Mixed- Methods Study Involving Healthcare IT. MIS Quarterly (MISQ). doi: 10.25300/MISQ/2020/14818. People experience technostress when they cannot adapt to or cope with information technologies in a healthy manner. They feel compulsive about being connected and sharing constant updates, feel forced to respond to work-related information in real-time, and engage in almost habitual multi-tasking. They feel compelled to work faster because information flows faster, and have little time to spend on sustained thinking and creative analysis. Craig Brod, a leader in the field of technostress research, states that technostress is \\"a modern disease of adaptation caused by an inability to cope with the new computer technologies in a healthy manner.\\"Brod, Craig. Technostress: The Human Cost of the Computer Revolution. Reading, Mass: Addison Weslety, 1984. Some of the earliest technostress scholarly studies in the field of Management Information Systems show that technostress is an undesirable phenomenon spawned by use of computing and communication devices such as computers, tablets and smartphones. It is dependent on gender, age and computer literacy. Women experience lower technostress than men, older people experience less technostress at work than younger people and those with greater computer literacy experience lower technostress.Tarafdar, M., Ragu- Nathan, T.S., Ragu-Nathan, B. and Tu, Q., The Impact of Technostress on Productivity, Journal of Management Information Systems, Summer 2007Ragu- Nathan, T.S., Tarafdar, M., Ragu-Nathan, B. and Tu, Q., Consequence of Technostress in End Users: Conceptual Development and Empirical Validation, Information Systems Research, December 2008, 19, 4, 417-433.Tarafdar, M, Tu, Q., Ragu-Nathan, T.S and Ragu-Nathan, B.S.

Giving too much Social Support: Social Overload on Social Networking Sites, European Journal of Information Systems (EJIS). doi: 10.1057/ejis.2014.3. A recent study of technostress in the context of healthcare technology reframes technostress by conceptualizing it in terms of a holistic technostress process involving two critical subprocesses: the techno-eustress subprocess and the techno-distress subprocess.Califf, C. B., Sarker, S., & Sarker, S. (2020). The Bright and Dark Sides of Technostress: A Mixed-Methods Study Involving Healthcare IT. MIS Quarterly (MISQ). doi: 10.25300/MISQ/2020/14818. This research finds that technostress hinges on individuals appraising environmental conditions as challenge techno-stressors, defined as techno-stressors that individuals tend to appraise as related to promoting task accomplishment, or hindrance techno-stressors, defined as techno-stressors that individuals tend to appraise as a barrier to task accomplishment. The challenge and hindrance techno-stressors are related to positive and negative psychological states in the individual, respectively, and in turn, positive and negative individual and organizational outcomes.Califf, C. B., Sarker, S., & Sarker, S. (2020). The Bright and Dark Sides of Technostress: A Mixed-Methods Study Involving Healthcare IT. MIS Quarterly (MISQ). doi: 10.25300/MISQ/2020/14818. Symptoms and outcomes Psychological stress can manifest itself physically. Similarly there are a number of symptoms of technostress. The anxiety expressed by those experiencing technostress: insomnia, loss of temper, irritability, frustration and can increase errors in judgement and poor job performance if not dealt with. In the 21st century, people equipped with technology at the workplace are most especially those experiencing technostress. People are sitting and facing computer monitors for a longer time which results in physical strain. In the 21st century work environment, people spend hours day at work because it is critical to their security and job satisfaction. However, these demands are becoming increasingly hazardous to their health. In a technological world, providing people with appropriate and safe physical environment is a necessity. Too much exposure to computer monitors is associated with emotional stress, and people are emotionally affected by technostress in their workplaces. Consequences of technostress include decreased job satisfaction, organizational commitment and productivity. A periodic assessment is necessary to check the level of technostress affecting professionals especially the physical and emotional aspects. Managers should organize technology-based trainings for employees to make them comfortable with technologies and awareness of their harmful effects. Technology skills for employees are important to consistently update their technological skills. Institutions, companies, and agencies are needed to employ IT specialists and troubleshooters to maximize system accessibility and provide a level of comfort to the employee. The causes of technostress amount to:Ennis, Lisa A. \\"The Evolution of Technostress.\\" Computers in Libraries, Sept. 2005, 10-12. *The quick pace of technological change *Lack of proper training *An increased workload *Lack of standardization within technologies *The reliability of hardware and software Four Aspects of Technostress: # Physical aspects are eye strain, backaches, headaches, stiff shoulders, neck pain, joint pain, dry mouth and throat, muscle tension, stomach discomfort, keyboard related injuries, chest pain, rapid heart rate, irritable bowel syndrome, increased blood pressure and difficulty in breathing. # Emotional aspects like irritability, loss of temper, having a high state of anxiety when separated from a computer monitor, feelings of indifference, frustration, lack of appreciation, depression, guilt, feeling fearful, paranoia that leads to avoiding computers and negative attitudes. # Behavioral aspects consists of feeling overly comfortable with computers, overspending on computers, insomnia, uncooperativeness and unwillingness, using computer terms in non- computer conversation, smoking, social withdrawal in favor of terminal time, cruising computer stores and drinking alcohol. # Psychological aspects are composed of information overload in order to find, analyze, evaluate, and apply it in the right context with resources, underwork and routine jobs lead to frustrations when underemployed or when the work done involves only routine operations, job security, where people have a fear that computers may replace human roles, professional jealousy produced by technological competency, de- motivation due to prolonged periods of any technological activity, uncertainty about job role caused by an increased time working with technology. There are five conditions that are classified as \\"technostress creators\\": #\\"Techno- overload\\" describes situations where use of computers forces people to work more and work faster. #\\"Techno-invasion\\" describes being ‚Äúalways exposed‚Äù where people can potentially be reached anywhere and any time and feel the need to be constantly connected. The regular work-day is extended, office work is done at all sorts of hours, and it is almost impossible to \\"cut away.\\" #\\"Techno-complexity\\" describes situations where the complex computer systems used at work force people to spend time and effort in learning and understanding how to use new applications and to update their skills. People find the variety of applications, functions, and jargon intimidating and consequently feel stressed. #\\"Techno-insecurity\\" is associated with situations where people feel threatened about losing their jobs to other people who have a better understanding of new gadgets and computing devices. #\\"Techno- uncertainty\\" relates to short life cycles of computer systems. Continuing changes and upgrades do not give people a chance to acquire experience with a particular system. People find this unsettling because their knowledge becomes rapidly outdated and they are required to re-learn things very rapidly and often. The holistic technostress process model:Califf, C. B., Sarker, S., & Sarker, S. (2020). The Bright and Dark Sides of Technostress: A Mixed-Methods Study Involving Healthcare IT. MIS Quarterly (MISQ). doi: 10.25300/MISQ/2020/14818. #\\"Environmental conditions\\" represent potential sources of technology-related stressful situations that may interact with any other environmental conditions such as role demands, task demands, interpersonal and behavioral expectations, job conditions, and workplace policies, among others. #The \\"Techno-eustress subprocess\\" involves: ##\\"Challenge techno-stressors\\" are technostressors that individuals tend to appraise as related to promoting task accomplishment. Examples include usefulness and involvement facilitation. ##\\"Positive psychological responses\\" are positive psychological responses to a technostressor, as indicated by the presence of positive psychological states. ##\\"Positive outcomes\\" are positive individual and organizational consequences related to the positive psychological state of the individual. Examples include an increase in job satisfaction and a decrease in turnover intention. #The \\"Techno-distress subprocess\\" involves: ##\\"Hindrance techno-stressors\\" are technostressors that individuals tend to appraise as a barrier or obstacle to task accomplishment. Examples include unreliability, insecurity, and overload. ##\\"Negative psychological responses\\" are negative psychological responses to a technostressor, as indicated by the presence of negative psychological states. ##\\"Negative outcomes\\" are negative individual and organizational consequences related to the negative psychological state of the individual. Examples include a decrease in job satisfaction and an increase in attrition and turnover intention. The techno-stressors, psychological responses, and outcomes are governed by three evaluation processes: #An \\"Appraisal process\\" is an intrapersonal process through which individuals appraise the technology- associated environmental conditions as challenges or hindrances. #A \\"Decision process\\" is an intrapersonal process through which individuals decide how to respond either positively or negatively to the appraised technostressor. This process occurs before the psychological response but after the individual has determined if the environmental condition represents a challenge or hindrance techno-stressor. #A \\"Performance process\\" is an intrapersonal process through which individuals decide how to act on their psychological response. This process occurs after the psychological response but before the individual determines his or her outcome. Coping strategies Technostress can be treated by getting user friendly software and educating people about new technology and creating better level of reassurance, patience and stability and communication within the job environment. Other option is avoid or restrict use of technology. Ways to eliminate technostress are conducting stress management activities to lessen and eliminate the problem of technostress such as exercise, meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, positive self talk, staying healthy and having healthy diet. Taking frequent breaks from technology, having a schedule, counseling, having awareness of technostress, establishing a teamwork relationship with colleagues may help.

It includes the Three Forks of the Missouri National Historic Landmark, designated in 1960 because the site is one where the Lewis and Clark Expedition camped in 1805. The park is open for day use and camping, offering hiking trails, hunting, and water-related activities. It is located on Trident Road northeast of Three Forks, Montana at an elevation of . Setting The bulk of Missouri Headwaters State Park is found on a peninsula flanked on the east by the Gallatin River and the west by the Missouri River and the Madison River. Small parts of the park are also located on the east bank of the Gallatin River, and an island in the Missouri just below the confluence of the Madison and Jefferson Rivers. The total park size is . The Jefferson River meets the Madison and Missouri roughly midway through the park's north-south extent. History The Lewis and Clark Expedition encamped at the confluence site on July 26, 1805. On July 28, Meriwether Lewis wrote in his journal: :\\"Both Capt. C. and myself in opinion with to the impropriety of calling either of these [three] streams the Missouri and accordingly agreed to name them after the President of the United States and the Secretaries of the Treasury and state...\\"Journals of the Lewis & Clark Expedition 28 July 1805. Retrieved 7 January 2020. The expedition were likely the first white men to ever penetrate this landscape. Lewis and Clark were at first uncertain how to proceed, and scouted each of the branches before ultimately departing on July 30 up the Jefferson River. The expedition also passed the forks on its return journey on July 13, 1806. As the west was explored and developed through the 19th century, the forks area was frequently used as a camp site by fur trappers. Acquisition for the state park was begun by preservation organizations in the 1960s. Claims of Missouri River source The Lewis and Clark decision not to call the Jefferson the Missouri has spurred debate over what is the longest river in North America, since the Missouri and Mississippi are nearly identical in length. The Missouri traditionally had been called the longest river in North America. However, 72 miles of it have been trimmed off in re-channeling its streambedmainly for the many hydroelectric power plants in the region so that it is now sometimes referred as second to the Mississippi in terms of length. If the Jefferson were included in the Missouri length, it would technically still be considered the longest river by experts of the United States Geological Survey. The utmost headwaters of the Missouri are subject to debate but two commonly claimed locations ultimately drain into the Jefferson. Lewis on August 12, 1805 said he visited the headwaters on Trail Creek just above Lemhi Pass on the Continental Divide in the Beaverhead Mountains at around 8,600 feet which he described: :the most distant fountain of the waters of the mighty Missouri in surch(sic) of which we have spent so many toilsome days and wristless(sic) nights. In 1888 Jacob V. Brower, who had championed turning the headwaters of the Mississippi River into a Minnesota state park, visited another site which today is also claimed to be the furthest point on the Missouri. Brower published his finding in 1896 in \\"The Missouri: Its Utmost Source.\\" Brower's Spring, as the site is now known, is at around 8,800 feet in the Centennial Mountains. The site is commemorated by a rock pile at the source of Hellroaring Creek which flows into Red Rock River and then into Clark Canyon Reservoir where it joins the Beaverhead then the Big Hole River before ultimately hooking up with the Jefferson.The True Utmost Reaches of the Missouri - Montana Outdoors - July-August 2005 See also *List of National Historic Landmarks in Montana *National Register of Historic Places listings in Gallatin County, Montana References External links * Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks.gov: Official Missouri Headwaters State Park website Category:State parks of Montana Category:Provincial and state parks in the Rocky Mountains Category:Missouri River Category:Protected areas of Gallatin County, Montana Category:Lewis and Clark Expedition Category:History of the Rocky Mountains Category:National Historic Landmarks in Montana Category:National Register of Historic Places in Gallatin County, Montana ","title":"Missouri Headwaters State Park"},{"id":"9444474","text":"The Bidjigal (also spelt Bediagal) people are an Aboriginal Australian people whose traditional lands are modern-day western, north-western, south-eastern, and southern Sydney, in New South Wales, Australia. Identity The Bidjigal are sometimes said to be a clan of the Dharug people, and sometimes a clan of the Eora people. Kohen has suggested that there may have been some confusion between two distinct groups: the Bidjigal (living in the Baulkham Hills area) and the Bediagal at Botany Bay in the Salt Pan Creek area. Attenbrow discusses their possible origin and location, and concludes that the question is \\"somewhat vexed\\". Norman Tindale, referring on the earliest historical sources, regarded them as a horde occupying the area just north of Castle Hill, Their geographical location is confusing, as they seem to have been based in southern Sydney, in the region between the Cooks River, Wolli Creek and the Georges River to Salt Pan Creek, and yet also seem to have inhabited land in the Hills District of Sydney, in what is now . Language group If they were a subgroup/clan of either the Dharug or Eora people, the Bidjigal would have spoken a variety of Dharug, one of the Yora languages. The name Bidjigal means plains-dweller in the Dharug language. Modern place name The name of the Bidjigal is today remembered by the name of the Bidjigal Reserve, in Baulkham Hills, Castle Hill, Carlingford, North Rocks and Northmead to the north-west of Sydney. The Bidjigal Reserve was known as Excelsior Park until 2004.

Well-designed and carefully positioned lighting makes patrons feel good and comfortable in their surroundings; bad lighting creates problems for patrons when they are reading, studying or searching for books and may keep their visit to the library short. Lighting can even have a negative impact on library staff too. If poor lighting harms the ability of the staff to function, which can happen if lighting creates glare and heavy shadows, the library is likely to be unpopular. A library with insufficient or poorly designed lighting is far from welcoming. Denise Enriquez, \\"Let There Be Light,\\" Library Talk 12, no. 5 (1999): 8. History reading room of the British Museum The coming of the electric light into society had a huge impact as well. Electric lighting has not always been around, and libraries had to function without it. The dawning of the electric light caused a huge impact in the library itself. This 19th-century innovation changed the library, and other public places, from relying on natural light, to a technology that could work no matter what time of day. Before the electric light, the library was so dependent on daylight that the sun determined its operating hours. Other technologies before the electric light were too unstable; open flamed lighting was just too risky because of the fire implications. Books could not be near open flames, since one accident could destroy the whole building, and its collection. Jeffrey Scherer, ‚ÄúLight and libraries,‚Äù Library Hi Tech 17, no. 4 (1999): 358. There was gaslight technology available, though, before electricity came around. It created light in dark spaces, but it was not a stable source. The issue of carbon dioxide poisoning, since its light was fed by natural gas to keep it running, was a huge problem. The issue of intoxication by gas, and the instability of the gas (which could result in explosions), led to the popularization of electricity. With the electric light, all of these problems discussed above were gone. There was not issue of death by explosion, as with the gaslight, and no more dependence on just natural light. John P. McKay, review of Disenchanted Night: The Industrialization of Light in the Nineteenth Century, by Wolfgang Schivelbusch, trans. Angela Davies, Isis 81, no. 4. (1990): 789. Now, the library could be open at any hour, which created more access to information for the patrons. Jeffrey Scherer, \\"Light and libraries,\\" Library Hi Tech 17, no. 4 (1999): 358. In an interesting twist, the 19th century is now having problems adjusting to this new technology that was created. With books produced in the 19th century, they are the most susceptible to electric lighting. Books were in high demand, during the 19th century, so to keep up with the desire of people, manufactures turned to cheap ways to increase outputs of books. This cheap process is now failing under the pressure of modern lights, which can be traced back to the invention that changed libraries in the 19th century. Shirley K.

Chen Yuan was the fourth son of Chen Shubao, and the oldest son of Chen Shubao's favorite concubine Consort Zhang Lihua. His exact birth year is not known. At the time of Chen Yuan's birth, Chen Shubao was crown prince under Chen Yuan's grandfather Emperor Xuan. On her account, Chen Shubao also greatly favored Chen Yuan, but at the order of Emperor Xuan, Chen Yuan's older brother Chen Yin, Chen Shubao's oldest son, was designated heir. (Chen Yin was also not born of Chen Shubao's wife Crown Princess Shen Wuhua, but Crown Princess Shen raised him after Chen Yin's mother Consort Sun died in childbirth in 573). Emperor Xuan died in 582, and Chen Shubao, after surviving a coup attempt, became emperor. He created Chen Yin crown prince, and in 583 created many of his sons, including Chen Yuan, imperial princes (in Chen Yuan's case, the Prince of Shi'an). Chen Yuan was said to be composed and intelligent in his youth, and not even his attendants could tell his emotions easily. In 588, Chen Shubao, after believing in accusations against Chen Yin, deposed Chen Yin and created Chen Yuan crown prince instead. In 589, Sui Dynasty forces captured the Chen capital Jiankang, ending Chen and unifying China. When soldiers under the command of the Sui general Han Qinhu () entered the crown prince's palace, Chen Yuan's staff largely fled, but Chen Yuan, said to be then a teenager, himself solemnly sat within his hall to wait for the soldiers to enter, attended only by Kong Boyu (). When the Sui soldiers entered, Chen Yuan greeted them, neither overly arrogantly nor overly self-deprecating, with, \\"You have marched a long way, and I can see that you are tired.\\" The Sui soldiers, impressed, treated him with respect. Chen Yuan's mother Consort Zhang was executed by the Sui general Gao Jiong, who blamed her for Chen's collapse. Chen Shubao, however, was not harmed, and was taken to the Sui capital Chang'an as an honored guest of Emperor Wen of Sui. Chen Yuan followed his father to Chang'an. During the reign of Emperor Wen's son Emperor Yang of Sui, Chen Yuan was made the governor of Fuhan Commandery (ÊûπÁΩï, roughly modern Linxia, Gansu). By the time that Sui fell and was replaced by Tang Dynasty, however, he was back in Chang'an, and he served as a mid-level official early in the reign of Emperor Gaozu of Tang.

There are many pre-20th-century mausoleums, and more continue to be built. Archaeology in Central Asia was active following its conquest by the Russian Empire, but remains a relatively understudied area. There has been some field work done in the city both before and during the rise of the Soviet Union, and there is likewise renewed interest in the city as one of the oldest cities of the independent country of Kazakhstan. Notable among the archaeological discoveries is evidence of an early plumbing system like the kinds found in Samarqand and other cities of the early Persian empires. There is another city named Sayram in Xinjiang, China located between Kucha and Aksu, which, according to local tradition, was founded by captives captured by the Qalmaqs.Barthold, rev. of TƒÅrƒ´kh-i Amniyya, in Sochineniya, viii, 213 Etymology The oldest name of the city according to historical evidence is Isfijab (Espij√¢b, Isfƒ´jƒÅb, Asfƒ´jƒÅb), which remained until the Mongol conquest. Mahmud Kashgari mentioned it as the \\"White City which is called Isbƒ´jƒÅb,\\" suggesting its connection with the Soghdian/Persian word for white, sipƒ´d or ispƒ´d.Bosworth, C.E. \\"Isfƒ´djƒÅb.\\" Encyclop√¶dia of Islam, 2nd ed., Brill, 2010. Kashgari also mentioned that the city was known as Sayram at that time, the name which the town bears today. The Russian Orientalist N. S. Lykoshin suggested that Sayram's correct name was Sar-i ayyƒÅm, or 'Ancient of Days'. His editor held, however, that instead of ayyƒÅm, it was instead the Arabic yamm, 'sea, river' and referred to the source of a stream.

It has a long history of commercial and political importance as a border town and has been the site of numerous conquests and reconquests. =Earliest history= Some local historians have attempted to find proof of Sayram's prehistory in the holy book of the Zoroastrian faith. They state that the first recorded mention of Sayram is in the Avesta, the holy book of Zoroastrianism. There are several names mentioned, though it is possible they refer to people, places, cities, or geographic features. Historian Richard Frye states that \\"even guesses about their identity do not help us in reconstructing history.\\"Frye, Richard. The Heritage of Central Asia: From Antiquity to the Turkish Expansion. Markus Wiener Publishers, Princeton. 1996. The word appearing in the Avesta is Sairima, which some historians equate with the name Sayram. There is mention of a river, and a land or people called Sairima elis, or people or land of/near Sayram. =Before Islam= In the 7th century, the Western Turkic Confederation consisted of five Tu-lu and five Nu- shih-pi tribes, known collectively as the On Oq (Ten Arrows) and by the Chinese as Shih Hsing (Ten Clans).The Cambridge history of early Inner Asia.

In that year, N≈´·∏• built a wall around it to protect it from the Turks. By this time the city was a flourishing market center at the nexus of nomad and sedentary lands. It was also a linchpin in the broad zone of protective forts built to protect the Samanid empire from nomadic raiders. Moqaddasi numbered these fortresses, or ribƒÅ·π≠s, at 1,700. They built outer walls to protect the crops of the inhabitants from raiders, but the town was not only a military outpost. Traders from Bukhara and Samarkand constructed large caravanserais for themselves in Sayram. Sayram was also the main contact between Samanid Islam and the Qaghan Turks of Turpan, Kashgar, and Kucha. The alternate southern routes were controlled by rival factions, leaving the primary route east through Farab and Sayram.The Passion of al-Hallaj, Mystic and Martyr of Islam. By Louis Massignon, Herbert Mason. Published by Princeton University Press, 1994. , Sayram is significant for maintaining a degree of independence from the Samanids, remaining a possession of the local Turkic dynasty. The rulers owed three signs of loyalty to the Samanids: military service, the presentation of symbolic gifts, and the name of the Samanid ruler on minted currency.History of Civilizations of Central Asia by M.S.

Published by Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1999 Sayram at this time was one-third the size of BanƒÅkath (now in ruins near present-day Chinoz, Uzbekistan), the chief town of the neighboring district of ShƒÅsh (present-day Tashkent). Sayram was divided into three districts, like others of the time: qohandez (citadel), madƒ´nah (inner town), and raba≈º (suburb), the latter two being protected by walls. All the houses were of mud brick. The government center (dƒÅr al- imƒÅrah), the prison, and the Friday mosque were all in the inner city. There were four main gates to the inner town, each guarded by a ribat manned by ghƒÅzƒ´s (volunteer fighters for the faith) recruited from Bukhara and Samarkand. The ruler of Sayram apparently also exercised some authority within the steppes, since Moqaddasi mentions that the \\"king of the Turkmen\\" at nearby rd≈´ habitually sent presents to Asfƒ´jƒÅb. =Under the Qarakhanids= The Qarakhanids seized the city in 980, during the reign of Nuh II of the Samanid Empire. At this time, according to al-Istakhri, the city marked the border between Karluks and Oƒüuz Turks.Peoples of Central Asia by Lawrence Krader. Published by Indiana University, 1971 Sayram was part of the eastern Qarakhanid khanate based on three cities: Sayram itself, Talas, and FarghƒÅna. Coins were minted there by the Qarakhanid rulers.O.

In 1220, the Taoist monk Qiu Chuji left his home town of Shandong in northern China and traveled to Persia to present himself before Genghis Khan. His fame as a pious exemplar of Taoist belief had preceded him,Bartold, V. V. (1963). Sochineniia. Moskva,, Izd-vo vostochnoi lit-ry. p. 517 and his travels carried him over roads newly restored by the Mongols, roads that were then in better condition than when the Russian imperial orientalist V. V. Barthold described them in the early 20th century. Qui Chuji (Chan-Chun, or –ß–∞–Ω-—á—É–Ω—å in Barthold's work) traveled through the land of the Uyghurs, through Kulja, through Zhetysu, crossing first the Chu River on a wooden bridge, then the Talas River on a bridge of stone, before reaching Sayram in November 1221.Bartold, V. V. (1963). Sochineniia.

The famous historian Rashid-al-Din (1247‚Äì1318Ôºâwrote that Sayram was also known as Kary Sailam (Old Sayram). At that time it was a large city with forty gates, and it took one whole day to cross the city.Mediaeval Researches from Eastern Asiatic Sources: Fragments Towards the Knowledge of the Geography and History of Central and Western Asia from the 13th to the 17th Century, E. Bretschneider. K. Paul, Trench, Tr√ºbner & co., ltd, 1910. =Sayram under Timur= It is unclear when the city fell under Timur's rule. Under the Timurids, Sayram was an important border city, a center of trade, and Timur gave rule of the city to his grandson Ulugbek.Four Studies on the History of Central Asia by Vasiliƒ≠ Vladimirovich Bartol πd. Published by E.J. Brill, 1963, University of California In 1404, the right wing of Timur's China-bound invasion force wintered in Sayram, Tashkent, and BanƒÅkath. ‚ÄòAbd al-RazzƒÅq wrote that in 1410 the fortress of Sayram was besieged by Moghul forces, and by the end of the 15th century was given to Yunus Khan of Moghulistan, where his son was reigning in 1496. During the Ming dynasty, envoy Chen Cheng was sent by the Yongle Emperor to the Timurid khanate and subsequently dedicated one chapter of his book A Record of the Barbarian Countries in the Western Region to Sayram.E. Bretschneider, Mediaeval Researches Vol. 2, p. 250 Toward the end of the Timurid power, in the middle of the 15th century, Sayram was raided regularly (along with Turkestan) by the Moghul amir Mir Haqq-Berdi Bekichek.V. V. Barthold, \\"History of the Semirechy√©,\\" in Barthold, Four Studies on the History of Central Asia, tr. V. and T. Minorsky (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1962), vol. I, pp. 137-165. =Sayram under Muhammad Shaybani= Shaybani Khan took Sayram in 1503. With the coming of Uzbek power in the region, Sayram fell to Muhammad Shaybani Khan along with the rest of the region. However, peace in the region was elusive. The Kazakhs soon grew in power and Sayram became a common prize of raids and wars between the Kazakhs, Uzbeks, and Qalmaqs. =Sayram under Kazakhs and Zunghars= In 1512, the keys of the city were given to Qasim Khan, Khan of the Kazakhs when he came to the city. In Babur's account, no khan was as respected or authoritative as Qasim, who could command over 300,000 men.Howorth, Henry. History of the Mongols from the 9th to the 19th Century. Part II: The So-Called Tartars of Russia and Central Asia. Burt Franklin, New York. 1880. Man·π£≈´r KhƒÅn led an Uzbek force against the Kazakhs in 1522 in response to their raids from the region of Sayram into the Farghana.TƒÅrƒ´kh-i Rashƒ´dƒ´, tr. Elias and Ross, 79, 358 The failure of this expedition to control Kazakh raids effectively ended attempts by the Uzbeks to control Sayram and its region. The rise of the collection of Oirat clans into what became known as the Zunghar Khanate in the 1600s saw much of what is now southern Kazakhstan leave the control of the Kazakh Khans. The historian Barthold argued that only after Galdan Boshugtu Khan, the Khong Tayiji of the Zunghars, had successfully conquered and destroyed the power of Sayram did he move his encampment west to the valley of the Ili, ensuring his control of Zhetysu east of Sayram. Galdan sent forces against Sayram in 1681, which must have been unsuccessful because they returned in 1683, when Barthold tells us that his commander Rabtan (probably Tsewang Rabtan took the city and razed it.V. V. Barthold, \\"History of the Semirechy√©,\\" in Barthold, Four Studies on the History of Central Asia, tr. V. and T. Minorsky (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1962), pp. 98-100. Sayram was slowly rebuilt, likely with the support of the merchants of Central Asia and the leadership of the Kazakhs. This knowledge comes from the fact that the city appears again as a target of Zunghar aggression forty years later. In 1723, the year of the Barefooted Flight of the Kazakhs, Sayram, TurkistƒÅn, and Tashkent passed under the control of the Qalmaqs and remained within their control until their destruction by the Chinese in 1758.E. J. Brill, The Encyclop√¶edia of Islam 1913‚Äì1938. =Sayram under the Khanate of Kokand= The city of Sayram was taken by the Ming of the Kokand Khanate in 1810. The local Qazaq population, and possibly the local sedentary population, revolted against Kokand control in 1820-1.Bregel, Yuri. An Historical Atlas of Central Asia. Handbook of Oriental Studies, sec. 8, vol. 9- Leiden: Brill, 2003. xi There is little mention of Sayram in regional histories until its fall to the Russians in 1864, by which time the nearby city of Chimkent had already begun to eclipse Sayram in local importance. =Sayram under the Russians= After the Russian conquest in 1864, several new villages were founded around Sayram. They were found to be prosperous by I. I. Geier, a local Russian journalist/historian writing in the first decade of the 20th century, though Sayram was still noted for its superior wheat, horse market, historical background, and many tombs.E. J. Brill, Encyclop√¶edia of Islam. 1913‚Äì1938. =Sayram under the Soviet Union= During National delimitation, the area of Sayram was at one point part of the Turkistan ASSR. At that time, the majority of modern-day Kazakhstan, including the steppe regions, were part of the separate Kirgizistan ASSR. After this period of border drawing and redrawing, Sayram eventually became part of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic. It remains in the successor independent country of the Kazakh SSR, Kazakhstan. Demographics Sayram's minaretThe population of over 40,000 is roughly 95% Uzbek, 3% Kazakh, and 1% Russian, with the remainder being Uzbek-speaking Azeris, Chechens, Tajiks, and Iranians. Sayram is a city of observant Muslims, and the call to prayer can be heard from the city's mosques. The economy of Kazakhstan being much stronger than Uzbekistan's, Sayram has seen an increase of migrant laborers from Uzbekistan, as well as those coming to stay as permanent residents. =Ethnic groups= The citizens of modern Sayram are ethnic Uzbeks. There is small minority of other ethnicities, mostly Kazakhs. =Religion= Sayram's Friday Mosque, built in the last ten years by donations from foreign philanthropists. The religion of the inhabitants of Sayram is Islam. Like most of Central Asia's Muslims, the people of Sayram follow the Hanafi school of Islamic jurisprudence. Main sights Main Gate of Sayram Minaret to the Kydyr mosque, 10th century. Roughly 45 feet (15 meters) tall. The newest mausoleum in Sayram today was built and finished in 2005 for Botbay Ata. Modern Sayram is still very much a part of ancient Central Asia. Unlike most of Kazakhstan, it bears almost no mark of Soviet planning or modernization. The streets curve in many directions, while the center of the town occupies the same crossroads that have been used for centuries. There are no apartments in the city proper, and no buildings more than two stories high, allowing the skyline to be dominated by the domes of local minarets, mosques, and mausoleums, some more than 1,000 years old. Transportation Sayram is reachable via a ten- to fifteen-minute bus, taxi, or marshrutka ride from Shymkent, which is host to an international airport that also receives domestic flights from Kazakhstan's international hubs Almaty and Nur-Sultan. See also =Ahmad Yasavi and Sayram= Turkestan The man who later became Khoja Ahmad Yasavi was born in Sayram. The date of his birth is difficult to ascertain from historical documents, and later 13th-century hagiographical sources show evidence of pushing the date of his life to before the Mongol Conquest, i.e. c. 1103‚Äì1166.Zarcone, Th. \\"Yasawiyya.\\" Encyclop√¶dia of Islam, 2nd ed., Brill, 2010. Brill Online. This chronology is generally accepted in contemporary Central Eurasian studies. His first teacher was Hazrat Shayh Shahobiddin Isfijabi. Today he is known by the nickname Oqota Baba (White Grandfather). Near his mausoleum, there is a small stream bridged by the main road into Sayram. This bridge is the focus of a local legend concerning the meeting of Ahmad as a boy and the great wanderer Arslan Bab. Ahmad in local legends According to legend,No Counting the Saints in Sayram, Makhmut Nursalaev (1999) Arslan was one of the Islamic prophet Muhammad's followers. He had already lived 300 years before meeting Muhammad, and was well versed in all of the world's religions, though he chose to follow Islam alone. As Muhammad's death drew near, he asked his followers who would take the stone of his holy date, a carrier of all Islamic knowledge, and give it to the next generation. Arslan replied that he would gladly bear this burden, and taking the stone, continued on his journey. Hundreds of years later, as he passed through the small town of Isfijab, Arslan Baba [his title of respect]Algar, H. \\"BƒÅb.\\" Encyclopedia Iranica. Originally published December 15, 1988. was stopped on the road by a young boy. \\"Grandfather, give me my date stone!\\" demanded the young Ahmad. Arslan relinquished the stone, and following the death of Ahmad's father in 1113, journeyed with Ahmad to Yasi. Uzbek) marking the bridge where Arslan Baba passed a persimmon stone to young Ahmad Yasavi From there Ahmad became a prize pupil and one of the rising stars of Sufism. Arslan Baba finally succumbed to old age and was buried near Otrar. Following Arslan's death, Ahmad moved to Bukhara and followed the studies of Yusuf Hamadani before moving to Yasi. The Yasavi Order He spent the majority of his life in Yasi, taking the name Ahmad Yasawi. His order is known as the Yasawiyya/Yasavi, and is particularly important in the history of the region, as well as in Anatolia.The Basic Views of Khoja Ahmad Yasav√Æ and His Followers. Tosun, Necdet. Ekev Academic Review, vol. 13, issue 38 (Winter 2009), p. 29-38 Their order was known for its disdain for hypocrisy and also the inclusion of certain historic Central Eurasian traditions identified with Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism.Zarcone, Th. \\"Yasawiyya.\\" Encyclop√¶dia of Islam', 2nd ed., Brill, 2010. Brill Online. The earliest historical record of the Yasavi Order comes from Hakim Ata, and the uncertainty surrounding Ahmad's order stems from the confusion regarding the multiple dates given for Hakim's life and possible direct descent from Ahmad as the second, third, fourth, or fifth generation of the order.DeWeese, Devin. \\"·∏§akim A·π≠ƒÅ\\", Encyclopedia Iranica. Originally published December 15, 2003. Ahmad's mother and father are buried in Sayram. Their mausoleums are both major sites of pilgrimage today, drawing pilgrims from all over Central Asia: Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and the surrounding area. Tƒ´m≈´r ibn Taraghay Barlas decreed that a mausoleum be raised over the site of the Sufi's grave. =See also= *History of Kazakhstan *Ahmed Yesevi *Kazakhstan *Uzbek language *Silk Road *Kazakhstan:Coming Of Age References Category:Populated places in Turkistan Region Category:Populated places along the Silk Road Category:History of Islam ","title":"Sayram (city)"},{"id":"9444641","text":"Joshua Vanneck, 2nd Baron Huntingfield (12 August 1778 ‚Äì 10 August 1844) was a British peer and Member of Parliament (MP).

Pulford, The Locke Kings of Brooklands Weybridge (1996) Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, King, Hugh Fortescue Locke (1848‚Äì1926), landowner and promoter of motor-racing by J. S. L. Pulford Early years He was born at Chertsey, the third of four sons and sixth of nine children of Louisa Elizabeth (n√©e Hoare; ca. 1813‚Äì1884) and Peter John Locke King (1811‚Äì1885), MP for East Surrey from 1847-74 (the younger son of Lord King of Ockham). Motoring and aviation on the estate Brooklands in Weybridge, Surrey, his inherited estate, became at his direction the site of many aeronautical and motoring milestones during the first half of the 20th century with motor races held at the circuit between 1907 and 1939, including two Grand Prix. Brooklands simply described a multi-channel stretch of the River Wey plus eastern hillsides and meadows supporting sheep and crops, the major secondary estate of the manor of Oatlands. The reduced but still hamlet- sized estate had been bought in 1830 by his father from the death estate of Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany for ¬£28,000 () Locke King decided during a European tour that Britain had to have its own motor testing track if its fledgling car industry were to develop and prosper in competition with Europe. He soon spent over ¬£150,000 () of his money developing it, which was returned with a small profit by its value to industry at his death.Photograph and history of the site, brooklands.org.uk; accessed 23 March 2016. Locke King devised and built the world‚Äôs first banked motor racing circuit here in 1906 and it became the home of British motor racing until 1939. He was inspired to build the 2.75 mile-long track. At 100 feet wide and 30 feet high to all bends, and with a fast downhill spur to assist the engines 'Start Hill' it attracted many spectators. Locke King was spurred on by Selwyn Edge (1868‚Äì1940), an experienced racing driver and car dealer, to complete the project with his highly publicised challenge that he would drive the course in a Napier (Lion) single-handedly at a constant 60 mph for 24 hours without a rest break. Edge was to complete his remarkable challenge on the finished track without mishap. His wife took over the supervision of the finish of the build after Locke King became too ill due to stress to continue partly due to the escalating costs to finish it. An aerodrome was constructed within the Track in 1909 and this soon attracted many pioneer aviators who collectively helped to create the British aviation industry. Family Hugh Locke King married Ethel Gore-Browne (later Dame Ethel Locke King, DBE) in 1884. They each supported the other's endeavours; she in spirit and he financially.

Together with his wife, Norah Roden Urquhart (June 23, 1918 ‚Äì March 13, 2009), he identified their migration routes and discovered that the migration spans multiple generations of butterflies. After many years of searching and with the help of Catalina Trail and Ken Brugger, the Urquharts found the location in Mexico where the butterflies spend their winter, far away from their summer residence areas in Canada and the United States. Monarch research Urquhart's research on the route and destination of the insects started in 1937 and lasted for 38 years. He and Norah tracked the trails of the butterflies by tagging the wings of thousands of individual butterflies. They founded the first Insect Migration Association, today known as Monarch Watch, and recruited hundreds of volunteers - \\"citizen scientists\\" who helped in their research by tagging butterflies and reporting findings and sightings. The Urquharts raised thousands of monarchs at their home in Scarborough, Ontario, as well as using the facilities of the University of Toronto to analyze their findings and do research. They identified several distinct migration routes, but were baffled why the trail seemed to disappear in Texas in the late fall, only to reappear in the spring. They sought help in Mexico and recruited a pair of naturalists to search for the butterflies. On January 9, 1975, Kenneth C. Brugger and his wife Catalina Trail (then known as Cathy Aguado) finally located the first known wintering refuge on a mountaintop in Michoac√°n, Mexico, more than 4,000 kilometers from the starting point of their migration. In 1976 the Urquharts traveled to Mexico to view the long-sought wintering site for themselves. The discovery was published in National Geographic magazine in August 1976; the article was titled \\"Discovered: The monarch's Mexican haven\\" and featured a cover photograph of Trail covered with butterflies. A dozen such sites are now known in Mexico; they are protected as ecological preserves by the Mexican government. The area is now a World Heritage Site known as the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve. Current conservation efforts are aimed at protecting monarchs in their breeding areas in the US and Canada. Among other discoveries, the Urquharts learned that the butterflies only travel in daylight and can fly up to in a day. The trip north spans several generations of monarchs, while a much- longer-lived \\"super generation\\" flies from the northern reaches of the butterfly's range all the way to Mexico, overwinters there, and breeds in the spring to start the next generation flying north. Education and career Urquhart was born in Toronto on December 13, 1911. As a child he was fascinated by insects, particularly monarch butterflies, and he wondered where they went during the winter. He attended the University of Toronto, graduating in 1935 with a degree in biology. He received an MA in 1937 and a PhD in 1940. During World War II he taught meteorology to students in the Royal Canadian Air Force. Following the war he began work as a zoology professor at the University of Toronto and a zoology director at the Royal Ontario Museum. He helped to found the Federation of Ontario Naturalists. In 1966 he helped to organize and teach the zoology program at Scarborough College, now the University of Toronto Scarborough, retiring in 1977. He was a popular lecturer and produced a highly successful television lecture series. He wrote four books, a monograph, and 62 papers in peer-reviewed journals, as well as numerous scientific reports and popular articles. His best known books are The Monarch Butterfly (University of Toronto Press, 1960) and The Monarch Butterfly: International Traveler (University of Toronto Press, 1987). On July 21, 1945, he married Norah Roden Patterson, who became his full collaborator in butterfly research, although she did not have a Ph.D. They had one son. Fred Urquhart died November 3, 2002 at the age of 90. Norah Urquhart died in Pickering on March 13, 2009 at the age of 90. Recognition In 1998 Fred and Norah Urquart were presented with Canada's highest civilian award, the Order of Canada. They received the W.W.H.

The organization has been involved with several international animal rescues, funding both the relocation and rehoming of circus lions, tigers, chimpanzees and other animals and has become a major force for animal protection, succeeding through its undercover investigations in securing legal protection for animals.  Animals in entertainment  Stop Circus Suffering is ADI's global campaign against the use of animals in circuses. ADI, through country-specific investigations, has contributed to the passing of animal rights laws, with Bolivia passing a law to ban both wild and domestic animal acts in all circuses; and similar legislation under consideration in Colombia and Peru. In the UK, ADI is lobbying the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to introduce a ban on the use of ‚Äúcertain non-domesticated animals‚Äù in traveling circuses in line with DEFRA's 2006 promise to introduce an Act. ADI's investigation into the use of animals in circuses in the UK and Europe in 1998, resulting in the first-ever footage of behind-the-scenes abuse of circus animals, resulted in the prosecution of international animal trainer (and Hollywood animal supplier) Mary Chipperfield, her husband Roger Cawley and their elephant keeper ‚ÄòSteve‚Äô Gills. Chipperfield was filmed beating a baby chimpanzee, whilst Cawley and Gills were filmed beating elephants at their headquarters in Hampshire, England. This resulted in the collapse of the UK animal circus industry, and a wholescale move over to human-only circuses. Only a few circuses remained with wild animals. The Stop Circus Suffering campaign is also active across Europe (Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Norway), and the US. In 2008, ADI released the findings of an undercover investigation of 9 US circuses, and exposed the beatings of elephants by trainer Mike Swain, at Bailey Brothers Circus. The USDA contacted Swain but took no further action. ADI is pursuing this. After a long campaign, in 2002 CITES (Conference of Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) introduced new regulations for live traveling exhibitions introducing a ‚Äòpassport style‚Äô system. ADI first pressed for this tightening up of the rules on circuses in 1997, after exposing a circus in Africa as an animal trafficking front. As well as its major campaigning activities on animal circuses, ADI also campaigns against the use of animals in advertising, television, films and video. Companies dropping advertising campaigns featuring animals include Toyota, Bombay Sapphire Gin, GMB Union and Careerbuilder. For ADI's My Mate's a Primate campaign ‚Äì which highlights the threats and exploitation of primates as a result of the bushmeat trade, in entertainment, the pet trade and in experiments ‚Äì a TV advert was produced in which a young actress highlighted the suffering of chimpanzees in advertising. In the UK, the advert was banned on the grounds that it was ‚Äúpolitical‚Äù. ADI's challenge against the ban ‚Äì which prevents advertising by animal, environmental and human rights organizations ‚Äì has now moved to the European Court of Human Rights. In 2011 ADI contacted American Humane Association (AHA), asking them to re-evaluate how they assess the use of animals in films and the statements being made which effectively endorse the use of performing animals. This action came after ADI made accusations that Tai, the elephant star of the film Water For Elephants, was abused prior to the movie, with AHA giving the film their ‚ÄúNo Animals Were Harmed‚Äù in the making certification.  Chipperfield case  Before the successful prosecutions of the elephant keeper and two directors, Mary Chipperfield Promotions Ltd was one of Europe's largest suppliers of animals for TV, advertising, movies, zoos, and circuses. From autumn 1997 to early 1998 ADI Field Officers worked undercover at Mary Chipperfield Promotions (MCP) in Hampshire, UK. This was the final assignment in an 18-month investigation. They recorded evidence of elephants, camels, and a baby chimpanzee being beaten. The chimp, Trudy, was seen being kicked, screamed at, and thrashed with a stick by the international trainer, Mary Chipperfield. In 1998, ADI issued multiple summonses for cruelty against Mary Chipperfield Promotions Ltd., the MCP elephant keeper Steve Gills, Mary Chipperfield (n√©e Cawley), and Roger Cawley and later that year Gills was convicted on multiple counts of cruelty and jailed because of his sustained and repeated attacks on the elephants in his care. In 1999, the trial of Mary Chipperfield and Roger Cawley began. At the end of the trial, Mary Chipperfield was convicted of 13 counts of cruelty to the chimpanzee Trudy and Roger Cawley (at the time a government zoo inspector) was convicted of cruelty to an elephant called Flora. The Mary Chipperfield trial remains the defining legal case in circus campaigning around the world. The video helped to prompt legislation on animal circuses, as well as local bans on animal use were introduced in many countries in Asia, Central and South America, the US, Canada, and several European countries. Some of the animals that featured in the trial disappeared, only Trudy was rescued. Chipperfield sold her farm in Hampshire, England, and moved to Spain. ADI continues to monitor her appearances in European circuses, as well as those of other Chipperfield family members.  Animal rescues  The story of Toto In September 2003, Toto, a circus chimpanzee, was rescued by ADI from a circus in Chile, and transported 7,000 miles to the world-renowned chimpanzee sanctuary, Chimfunshi Wildlife Orphanage in Northern Zambia. Twenty-seven-year-old Toto was taken from the wild in Africa aged just 2‚Äì3 years old. Toto is believed to have been purchased in the US by Chile's Circus Konig, along with three other baby chimpanzees. The other three died, leaving Toto alone with the circus for at least twenty years. Toto was chained by the neck, and his act involved dressing up in human clothes, smoking cigarettes and drinking tea. He lived in a tiny wooden packing crate little more than a metre wide, with bars on the front. Entire circus seized in Mozambique In an international rescue mission, ADI secured every animal from the Akef Egyptian Circus, stationed in Maputo, Mozambique. This was the first time such a broad-based rescue had ever taken place. The animals ‚Äì 6 lions, 3 tigers, 1 African rock python, 3 horses (a mare and her very young foal, plus a stallion), and 7 dogs ‚Äì had been abandoned. The Mozambique government confiscated all of the animals and placed them in the care of ADI. The python, tigers and lions were confiscated for CITES and import permit contraventions, in addition to welfare reasons. The horses were rehomed in Mozambique and the lions, tigers, pythons and dogs were moved to South Africa where they spent some time in quarantine whilst waiting for a permanent home. Murphy the python could not be released and went to a protected enclosure at Fitzsimons Snake Park in South Africa. Three of the lions, from the extinct-listed Barbary sub-species, lived at the Hoedspruit Endangered Species Centre until they died of old age a decade later. The other three lions were placed with the Moholoholo Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre, by 2009, one remains to a fit and healthy old age, the others having succumbed to the passage of time. The tigers were rehomed with the Milimani Game Lodge. After about 8 years, their home was lost in a land claim and ADI retrieved and relocated them to live at Hoesdpruit, where they spent the remainder of their lives. Tarzan, Sarah and Caesar In 2007 ADI rescued two lions, Sarah and Caesar, and a tiger, Tarzan, from Circo Universal in Portugal. Having been spotted by an ADI Field Officer in 2006, the animals appeared to be abandoned but were in fact off the road due to lack of funds. The Portuguese authorities seized the animals, who were held at Lisbon Zoo before they were handed over to ADI, who then arranged for them to be moved to their rescue centre in South Africa, where they remain. Peru: Spirit of Freedom In 2014, ADI traveled to Peru for their largest animal rescue operation called Operation Spirit of Freedom. ADI took custody of 24 lions from circuses in Peru and 9 in Colombia, a Tiger named Hoover, a spectacled bear named Cholita and a mountain lion named Mufasa.  Animal experiments  The Save The Primates campaign was launched in 2009, in an attempt to expose the global primate trade across three continents, including one of Europe's largest testing facilities ‚Äì Huntingdon Life Sciences in Cambridgeshire. Their investigations revealed owl monkeys were taken from the rainforest for malaria experiments in Colombia, monkeys in rusting, collapsing cages at a Home Office-approved monkey supplier in Vietnam and, in the UK, primates in commercial testing were caught on film at Huntingdon Life Sciences in Cambridgeshire, a major contract testing operation for multi-national product brands which can hold up to 550 monkeys at a time. During the one-year ADI undercover investigation, 217 monkeys were killed in just five studies, which included struggling monkeys being strapped into chairs and forced to inhale products. In September 2007, the European Parliament adopted a Declaration co-originated by ADI calling for bans on the use of wild-caught primates and great apes, along with a timetable for phasing out the use of all primates in experiments. 55% of MEPs signed the Declaration, making it the most supported on an animal protection matter ever. In November 2008, the European Commission published its proposal for a new Directive on animal testing, replacing Directive 86/609/EEC. It included a requirement for prior authorisation for all animal experiments, the 3Rs (replacement, reduction, refinement) as a cornerstone of the legislation with particular emphasis on replacement, ethical reviews, a licensing system for suppliers, establishments and individuals using animals, an upper limit of pain, uniform implementation of Council of Europe standards of housing, the extension of the scope of the Directive to some invertebrate species and foetal animals, and other measures. However, there were also shortcomings. Notably, bans on the use of great apes and endangered species contained loopholes and exemptions. The Directive will now go to the Council of Ministers, where every Member State will have its say on the Commission's proposal and on the European Parliament's amendments. The Directive can only be adopted if both the Council and the Parliament agree on the same text. The Commission would play an important conciliatory role if the two institutions were to disagree.

Written by Alan Pattillo and directed by David Lane, it was first broadcast on 10 March 1966 on ATV Midlands . Set in the 2060s, the series follows the exploits of International Rescue, an organisation that uses technologically-advanced rescue vehicles to save human life. The main characters are ex-astronaut Jeff Tracy, founder of International Rescue, and his five adult sons, who pilot the organisation's main vehicles: the Thunderbird machines. The plot of \\"Attack of the Alligators\\" sees a group of alligators grow to enormous size after their swamp is contaminated by a new food additive. When the reptiles lay siege to a house, International Rescue is called in to save the trapped occupants. Combining science-fiction and haunted house themes, with a plot deliberately written to be \\"nightmarish\\", \\"Attack of the Alligators!\\" was filmed at APF Studios in Slough in late 1965. It was the first APF production to use live animals, the re-sized alligators being played by juvenile crocodiles. Filming of the episode was controversial as the crew resorted to using electric shocks to coax movement out of the animals. Concern for the crocodiles' welfare prompted an investigation by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), which ultimately took no action against APF. \\"Attack of the Alligators!\\" remains a favourite with Thunderbirds fans and commentators and is generally regarded as one of the series' best episodes. Along with \\"The Cham-Cham\\", the next episode to enter production, it went over-budget, causing the final instalment of Thunderbirds Series One (\\"Security Hazard\\") to be re- written as a clip show to lower costs. In 1976, \\"Attack of the Alligators!\\" inspired an episode of The New Avengers titled \\"Gnaws\\", written by ex- Thunderbirds writer Dennis Spooner. Plot A businessman, Blackmer, visits the reclusive Dr Orchard, a scientist who lives in a dilapidated house on the Ambro River. From the local plant Sidonicus americanus, Orchard has developed a food additive called \\"theramine\\" that increases the size of animals. Enlargement of animal stock presents a simple solution to world famine as well as other economic advantages. Blackmer's boatman, Culp, has been eavesdropping on the meeting. When a storm forces Blackmer to stay at the house overnight, Culp decides to steal the theramine and sell it to the highest bidder. Waiting until the house's other occupants are asleep, he breaks into Orchard's laboratory and pours some theramine into a vial. The rest of the supply is accidentally knocked into a sink and drains into the Ambro River. When Blackmer and Culp leave the next morning, their boat is attacked by an alligator, now enormous due to the theramine contamination. Orchard's assistant, Hector McGill, manages to rescue Blackmer but Culp is nowhere to be found. The house is quickly surrounded by three giant alligators that repeatedly hurl themselves at the building with Orchard, Blackmer, McGill and the housekeeper, Mrs Files, trapped inside. At Mrs Files' suggestion, McGill transmits a distress call to International Rescue. This is picked up by John Tracy (voiced by Ray Barrett) on the Thunderbird 5 space station and relayed to Tracy Island, where Jeff (voiced by Peter Dyneley) immediately dispatches his other four sons to the danger zone in Thunderbirds 1 and 2. Arriving in Thunderbird 1 and transferring to a hover-jet, Scott (voiced by Shane Rimmer) fires the hover-jet's missile gun to disperse the alligators and accesses the house via the laboratory window. The room eventually caves in, forcing Scott and the others to retreat to the lounge. There, they are confronted by Culp, who holds them at gunpoint. Virgil, Alan and Gordon (voiced by David Holliday, Matt Zimmerman and David Graham) arrive in Thunderbird 2. Alan and Gordon man tranquiliser guns and subdue two of the alligators. When the third returns to the house, Alan exits Thunderbird 2 on another hover-jet to lure it away. He hits a tree and falls off the hover-jet, but is saved by Gordon, who tranquilises the alligator before it reaches Alan. Threatening to empty the entire theramine vial into the Ambro unless he is given safe passage upriver, Culp sets off in Blackmer's boat. At the same time, Gordon launches Thunderbird 4. A fourth, much larger alligator appears and attacks the boat, killing Culp. Virgil disposes of the creature with a missile fired from Thunderbird 2. Later, Gordon finds the theramine vial intact on the riverbed. After his sons return to Tracy Island, Jeff announces that theramine will be subject to international security restrictions. Tin-Tin (voiced by Christine Finn) has been away on a shopping trip and has bought Alan a present for his birthday ‚Äì a pygmy alligator. Production The episode was partly inspired by H. G. Wells' 1904 novel The Food of the Gods and How It Came to Earth and its theme of animal size change. Another influence was the 1927 film The Cat and the Canary and its 1939 re-make,Archer 2004, p. 74. both of which feature haunted house premises and stalker characters. Writer Alan Pattillo, who according to special effects supervisor Derek Meddings \\"had tried to come up with the most nightmarish rescue situation he could\\",Meddings 1993, p. 75. had wanted to direct the episode as well. Ultimately, however, it was directed by David Lane.La Rivi√®re 2009, p. 127. The opening scene features an insert shot of a stormy sky that was later used to introduce the opening titles of The Prisoner.Bentley 2005, p. 87. \\"Attack of the Alligators!\\" was filmed in October and November 1965.La Rivi√®re 2009, p. 129. Production went over- schedule, forcing the crew to work extra hours, and sometimes long into the night, to complete the filming. Special effects technician Ian Wingrove remembered that the episode's complex technical aspects once resulted in the crew \\"[working] day and night ... through a weekend\\". The alligators in the episode were portrayed not by actual alligators, as Gerry Anderson had originally intended,Bentley 2005, p. 29. but by juvenile crocodiles. These were acquired from a private zoo in the north of England to double as the enlarged alligators on the episode's scale sets and water tanks.Bentley 2005, p. 30. The crocodiles that appear in the episode were long; a larger specimen, measuring , was not used as it was too aggressive to be taken out of its box. The crew kept the water tanks heated to a suitably warm temperature and used electric shocks to coax movement out of the crocodiles. The animals were unpredictable and difficult to control, either basking in the heat of the studio lights or disappearing into the tanks for hours at a time.Meddings 1993, p. 74. To make them more visible to the cameras, the crew attached them to guiding rods and co-ordinated their movements. The use of live animals in both puppet and scale model shots required an unusually close collaboration between the puppet and effects crews. Effects director Brian Johnson and several other crew members boycotted the production on animal welfare grounds. Camera operator Alan Perry did not remember any of the crocodiles being mistreated; series supervising director Desmond Saunders, however, claimed that more than one specimen died of pneumonia after being left overnight in an unheated tank. Director David Elliott, though filming a different episode at the time, recalled that another dislocated one of its limbs after receiving an electric shock. Puppet operator Christine Glanville admitted that the filming would not have been pleasant for crocodiles because the tanks contained \\"all sorts of dirty paint water, oil and soapy water to make it look swampy.\\" Saunders commented: \\"It was scandalous. It was one of the great episodes. Nevertheless there was a price to be paid for it.\\" Concerns about possible animal cruelty prompted an anonymous telephone call to the RSPCA, which sent an inspector to the studios. After a brief investigation, no action was taken against APF. This coincided with a decision to increase the voltage of the electric shocks to induce greater movement from the crocodiles.La Rivi√®re 2009, p. 126. According to Gerry Anderson, when the inspector arrived, \\"Meddings explained that his team were laying the crocodiles down and they weren't doing anything. They were just lying there. The RSPCA man said, well, they would, because of the warmth of the lamps. So Derek said, 'We've been giving them a touch with an electrode just to make them move.' The guy asked what voltage they were using and Derek said it was about 20 volts, and the guy said, 'Oh, they've got terribly thick skins, you know. If you want them to move, you'll have to pump it up to 60.'\\" The inspector later joined the production to work alongside the crocodiles' handler. Filming with the crocodiles was often hazardous. During a promotional photography shoot featuring Lady Penelope (who does not appear in the episode), one of the animals attacked the puppet and destroyed one of its legs.Archer 2004, p. 20. During the filming of a particular scene, Meddings was pulling a crocodile towards him on a rope when the animal slid out of its harness.Archer 2004, p. 41. In his book 21st Century Visions, Meddings wrote of the incident: \\"My crew never saw me move as fast as I did to get out of the tank when I pulled the rope and realised the creature was free.\\" Of the largest crocodile, which was kept at the back of the stage when not being used, Wingrove recalled: \\"You would forget that it was there, then one day someone shouted 'Look out!' and we turned round to see this big crocodile walking across the stage ‚Äì which cleared of people very quickly!\\" Both this episode and \\"The Cham-Cham\\", the next episode to enter production, exceeded their budgets. This led the writers to re-script the final episode of Thunderbirds Series One (\\"Security Hazard\\") as a clip show to reduce costs.Bentley 2005, p. 31. Broadcast and reception \\"Attack of the Alligators!\\" was seen by 4.78 million viewers when it was broadcast on BBC2 on 20 March 1992. Thunderbirds was repeated on the BBC in 2000, a year known for several major rail accidents in the UK (notably the Hatfield rail crash; others occurred in the village of Tisbury in Wiltshire and Hither Green in London). For this re-run, it was decided to postpone the episodes \\"The Perils of Penelope\\" and \\"Brink of Disaster\\" (both of which feature train disasters) until the end. \\"Brink of Disaster\\" was replaced with \\"Attack of the Alligators\\", which became the eleventh episode to be repeated. =Critical response= \\"Attack of the Alligators!\\" is a popular episode of Thunderbirds and is widely regarded as one of the series' best. It was well received by Sylvia Anderson, who described it as her favourite episode. Stephen La Rivi√®re considers the plot to be one of the most unusual of the series.La Rivi√®re 2009, p. 125. Lew Grade, head of distributor ITC, expressed great satisfaction with the filming during a visit to APF Studios in 1965. In 2004, \\"Attack of the Alligators!\\" was re-issued on DVD in North America as part of A&E; Video's The Best of Thunderbirds: The Favorite Episodes. Reviewing the release for the website DVD Verdict, David Gutierrez awarded \\"Attack of the Alligators!\\" a perfect score of 100, declaring it the best episode in the collection and praising its production values: \\"It's like a beautifully directed short film\\". He elaborated: \\"'Attack of the Alligators!' serves as a terrific example of how strong Thunderbirds can look. It's not Howdy Doody sporting a jetpack ‚Äì it's an hour-long programme that feels like a motion picture.\\" Susanna Lazarus of Radio Times suggests that the episode is memorable specifically for its crocodile footage. The techniques used to produce the footage have caused the episode to be described as \\"controversial\\" by some sources. Mark Pickavance of the website Den of Geek criticises the footage from a visual standpoint, arguing that the use of scale sets with young crocodiles, \\"shot in super close-up to make them seem huge\\", does not produce a convincing illusion of giant alligators. Author Dave Thompson compares the giant reptiles to Swamp Thing, a superorganism featured in the DC Comics Universe. In 1976, ex-Thunderbirds writer Dennis Spooner adapted the premise of \\"Attack of the Alligators!\\" to write \\"Gnaws\\", an episode of The New Avengers featuring an enlarged rat.

It lies predominantly within The Hills Shire, with a small section south of the M2 Motorway in the City of Parramatta. The reserve lies in the suburbs of , , , , West Pennant Hills, and . The reserve lies south of Richard Webb Reserve in West Pennant Hills, with the majority located to the north of the M2 Motorway. Name Its name commemorates the Bidjigal people who lived in the area. In particular, it is said that Pemulwuy, a Bidjigal leader of aboriginal resistance against British occupation, used the area as a base to mount attacks on neighbouring homesteads. The reserve includes a long section of Darling Mills Creek, a tributary of the Parramatta River, and once an important source of water both to the mills in Parramatta, and for drinking. Features The reserve includes a number of walking trails which range from short circular walks up to walks of several kilometres in length, some of which join onto the Great North Walk. The reserve is home to a wide range of native flora and fauna. It includes a rich diversity of vegetation which includes remnants of Blue Gum High Forest and ridgetop woodlands, but mostly consists of dry sandstone gully forest on sandstone base soils with some areas retaining Wianamatta Shales. The rich understorey includes interesting species like Native Iris (Patersonia glabrata), Native Grape (Cissus hypoglauca) and the Red Beard Orchid (Calochilus paludosus). In recent years there have been reliable recordings of koala, swamp wallaby, echidna, eastern water dragon, and sugar gliders, as well as the ubiquitous brushtail and ringtail possums. Powerful owl have also been seen in the reserve. Foxes have been largely eradicated by a continuing baiting program, leading to a significant increase in the number of native animals in the reserve. The reserve also includes a local landmark (known locally as the Aboriginal Cave) at Latitude -33.758010 Longitude 151.011660 which is a rock shelter that was apparently described in times of early European occupation as being a cave used by the Bidjigal people. Several other aboriginal rock shelters also lie within Bidjigal Reserve, including one with a midden dated to 10150 bp, which is the earliest human habitation site known in the Sydney area (although older sites are known in the Blue Mountains). There are also reliable reports of other works of Australian aboriginal art, including hand stencils and rock engravings, but none have been identified in recent years, and they may have been damaged or destroyed. History and Management On 15 September 2001, an agreement was reached between the Government of New South Wales, Baulkham Hills Shire Council and descendants of the Darug to settle an outstanding native title claim (N94/6)which dated back to 1994. The Darling Mills State Forest and Excelsior Park (with the exception of the Ted Horwood Reserve and the Eric Mobbs Reserve) were combined and made into the Bidjigal Reserve by a deed of agreement signed on 4 December 2003 on behalf of the Minister for Lands. Signatories to that deed were the Crown, Baulkham Hills Shire Council and Bundeluk of the Darug tribe. Other signatories were Telstra and Integral Energy (due to the presence of their infrastructure in the reserve). The Forestry (Darling Mills State Forest Revocation) Bill, which was passed by NSW state government on 2 March 2005 allowed that land to be included in the reserve, as required by the deed. Bidjigal reserve was dedicated for the purposes of preservation of aboriginal cultural heritage, flora and fauna and public recreation on 22 October 2004. Ownership of the reserve is vested in the Bidjigal Reserve Trust. The reserve is managed by the Bidjigal Reserve Trust Board. The first Bidjigal Reserve Trust Board meeting was held on 4 March 2005. The first Board consisted of 4 individual trustees. They were appointed by the Crown Lands minister, for a 5-year term. Those individuals consisted of both Darug descendants, and also local residents. In addition, the secretaries of the Darug Custodians Aboriginal Corporation and the Darug Tribal Aboriginal Corporation, the general manager of Baulkham Hills Shire Council (BHSC), the secretary of the Bushland Conservation Committee (BCC) (of BHSC) and the secretary of the Upper Parramatta River Catchment Trust (now the Sydney Metropolitan Catchment Management Authority), or their delegates were also members of the Board. A representative of the Excelsior Park Bushland Society was later added to the Board Members. That structure still remains, excepting that the trustees now have been increased in number to 6. The first chair of the board was Graeme Postlethwaite, and the second, Carol Isaacs (also chair of the BCC). David Wilmshurst (also BCC member, and Ms Isaac's proxy) was elected the third chair, with Carol Isaacs as deputy chair on 3 April 2008. The second Trust Board met for the first time on 12 February 2010. At that meeting, David Wilmshurst was again elected chair, with Carol Isaacs as deputy. At the AGM on 9 February 2011, Steven Brett was elected the fourth chair, unopposed. Michael Cameron was elected deputy chair. On 1 December 2007, BHSC resigned its membership of the Board, citing issues related to the funding of crown land.

It is a small sesamoid bone found in some mammals embedded in the tendon of the lateral head of the gastrocnemius muscle behind the lateral condyle of the femur. It is an accessory bone, an anatomical variation present in 39% of humans. Rarely, there are two or three of these bones (fabella bi- or tripartita). It can be mistaken for a loose body or osteophyte. In humans, it is more common in men than women, older individuals compared to younger, and there is high regional variation, with fabellae being most common in people living in Asia and Oceania and least common in people living in North America and Africa. Bilateral cases (one per knee) are more common than unilateral ones (one per individual), and within individual cases, fabellae are equally likely to be present in right or left knees. Taken together, these data suggest the ability to form a fabella may be genetically controlled, but fabella ossification may be environmentally controlled. Although the fabella seems to have disappeared with the evolution of Hominidae, it reappeared in humans sometime after they diverged from chimpanzees. It is unknown whether it reappeared soon after this divergence, 5‚Äì7 million years ago, or more recently in human evolution . \\"The fabella can lead to posterolateral knee pain either due to cartilage softening (chondromalacia fabellae) or other osteoarthritic changes on its articular surface.\\" See also * Fabella sign References Further reading * *Werner, Platzer: Color Atlas of Human Anatomy, Vol. 1: Locomotor System (7th ed.), published by Thieme, 2015 () External links Category:Sesamoid bones Category:Accessory bone Category:Anatomical variations ","title":"Fabella"},{"id":"9445301","text":"Serge Muhmenthaler (born 20 May 1953) is a Swiss former professional football player and referee.

Manaure's main economic activity is the exploitation of the vast amounts of salt in the area. Geography The municipality of Manaure is located in northernmost part of South America, on the arid plains of the Guajira Peninsula, in the Colombian Caribbean region, bordering to the north with the Caribbean Sea to the east with the municipality of Uribia; to the south with the municipality of Maicao and to the west with the municipality of Riohacha. Manaure: Geography The municipality of Manaure is within the Guajira-Barranquilla xeric scrub with water streams determined by precipitations during the rainy seasons. The municipality seat of Manaure is crossed by the Lim√≥n Creek which flows into the Caribbean sea. The coastline has high concentration of salt, rocks and clay over predominantly flat plains, slightly undulated in some areas. =Climate= Climate in the municipality of Manaure is hot and dry throughout the year, averaging between and throughout the year with constant winds from the northeastern trade winds, evaporation of humidity is high. The area has two rainy seasons averaging 150 mm from May to June and from October to November) and two dry seasons in between these months. Manaure: Climate History Manaure salt lagoons Chronicles from the Spanish explorer first detailed some indigenous in the area called Coanaos which traveled between the Cabo de la Vela and the region of Valledupar to exchange salt for gold. During the 19th century salt in the region was exploited at Honda Bay and Quebrada Bay on coasts of what is part of the municipality of Manaure which naturally formed lagoons. In 1777 the Spanish government ordered the administration of the Salinas. Bank of the Republic: ASPECTOS HISTORICOS Y SOCIOECONOMICOS DE LAS SALINAS DE MANAURE by Mar√≠√≠a Aguilera D√≠az (Riohacha, 14 de octubre de 2004) In 1824 the government declared the Salinas or salt mines as national patrimony of the nation establishing a regulatory price control. In 1932 the bank of the Republic was given authority over the administration and exploitation of salt mines in Zipaquir√°, Nemoc√≥n and Sesquil√©. Industrial exploitation and processing of salt in Manaure began in the 1920s when the government gave concessions to individual investors for the exploitation of the salt mine and until the 1940s the mode of collection went from artisan to industrial, when the Bank of the Republic took over the Manaure salt mines. By 1948 salt production in Manaure was between 20,000 and 30,000 tons a year. In 1970 the concession of Manaure salt mines was transferred to the IFI-Concesi√≥n Salinas which intensified the production to one million tons a year. The Wayuu began to claim the area as their ancestral land and historical owners of Manaure. In 1991 the government recognized the claim by the Wayuu and agreed to reorganize production and work conditions under a mixed economy, in which the indigenous would have 25% of the stocks in the company. The accords were not met and the Wayuus sued the government in 1994. The court ordered the creation of Sociedad Salinas de Manaure, SAMA based on the original agreement and linked to the then Ministry of Development. The Wayuu would have 25%, but once again the agreements were not met due to legal problems. In 2002 Law 773 of the same year reestablished the creation of the SAMA, distributing earnings among the Ministry of Development (51%) the indigenous Association \\"Sumain Ichi\\" (25%) and the municipality of Manaure (25%).

It stars Gary Cooper as an American scientist sent by the OSS to contact European scientists working on the German nuclear weapons program and Lilli Palmer as a member of the Italian resistance movement who shelters and guides him. The story is drawn from the 1946 non-fiction book Cloak and Dagger: The Secret Story of O.S.S. by Corey Ford and Alastair MacBain, and a former OSS agent E. Michael Burke acted as technical advisor. Plot In 1944 in the USA, nuclear physicist Alvah Jesper, a handsome bachelor who is working on the Manhattan Project to build an American nuclear bomb, is recruited into the Office of Strategic Services. His mission is to make contact with a Hungarian nuclear physicist, Katerin Lodor, who has been working on the German project to make a nuclear bomb and has escaped into neutral Switzerland. Flown into Switzerland, Alvah finds it full of German agents who, after he manages one brief conversation with Katerin, abduct her. By befriending and then blackmailing an attractive female agent, he discovers where Katerin is being held, but an OSS raid on the building fails and she is shot dead. In the conversation, she had said that the Germans wanted her to work with an Italian nuclear physicist named Polda. The OSS land Alvah in Italy from a British submarine and he is hidden by an attractive member of the Resistance, Gina. He manages to obtain a brief conversation with Polda, who agrees to work with the Americans only if the OSS first free his daughter Maria, who is being held by the Germans. The OSS raid on the building is successful and in an isolated safe house they deliver Maria to her father. He is horrified, because it is not his daughter but a German agent, who says the house is surrounded by German troops. In the ensuing gun battle, Alvah and Gina smuggle Polda out through the cellar and struggle across country to a rendezvous with a British aircraft which will fly them out. Polda and Alvah board it safely, but Gina says she must stay behind to free her country from the Germans and begs Alvah to come back for her when the war is over.

Jesper (Cooper) leads a group of American paratroopers into Germany to discover the remains of an underground factory, the bodies of dead concentration camp workers, and evidence the factory was working on nuclear weapons. Jesper remarks that the factory may have been relocated to Spain or Argentina and launched a diatribe saying: \\"This is the Year One of the Atomic Age and God help us if we think we can keep this secret from the World!\\"p. 197 Frayling, Christopher Mad, Bad and Dangerous?: The Scientist and the Cinema (Reaktion Books, 2005) Producer Milton Sperling, who had frequently quarreled with Lang on the set, thought the final scene ridiculous, since the audience knew the Germans had no nuclear capacity. Screenplay writers Lardner and Maltz became two of the Hollywood Ten, accused of adding communist dogma to movie scripts such as this one.

Nakamura described himself as seeking a \\"fundamental universal pattern in all art and nature\\" reflected in his \\"inner structure\\" paintings from the 1950s.Ihor Holubizky, \\"Nakamura: The Method of Nature,\\" Kazuo Nakamura: The Method of Nature, Oshawa, Ontario: Robert McLaughlin Gallery, 2001, p. 12 In the 1970s and 1980s he increasingly emphasized his grid paintings based on number structures, which came to involve the Fibonacci number system. To Nakamura, these laboriously inscribed works were a quest for some ultimate order in the apparent chaos of the universe. Commissions His work is part of the permanent collection at Toronto's Lester Pearson International Airport and Ontario Provincial Queen's Park Complex. International exhibitions In 1983 and 1984 as part of Ontario Heritage Foundation's Firestone Collection Nakamura's work toured London (UK), Paris and Madrid. In 1991 he exhibited at the New Canadian Embassy in Tokyo and in 1992 at Ader Tajan, Art Contemporain du Canada, Espace Chapon in Paris. Honours In 2000 Nakamura was made an honorary fellow at the Ontario College of Art & Design and in 2004 he was the subject of the posthumous retrospective Kazuo Nakamura: A Human Measure at the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto.Kazuo Nakamura: A Human Measure He was made a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts.

The Ginga followed a similar route to the much faster T≈çkaid≈ç Shinkansen high-speed line, and filled the overnight gap in the Shinkansen's timetable. While the last Osaka-Tokyo Shinkansen trains departed at 21:20 (in either direction, as of 2008), Ginga departed Osaka at 22:30 and Tokyo at 23:00, and arrived over an hour before the first Shinkansen arrival the next morning. This made it somewhat popular among business travelers who needed a later departure or earlier arrival than the Shinkansen could provide. However, the numerous overnight buses on the Tokyo-Osaka route largely captured the budget traveler market, while late evening and early morning flights to Kansai Airport (which opened in 1994 and does not have the noise restrictions facing Osaka Airport) were now used by many business travelers who would otherwise have used Ginga.

It is a key landmark of the town. Originally a medieval fortress, it was probably constructed in the 11th century and rebuilt in the 12th century. It acquired its present outline with an almost complete overhaul in the 15th century, whereas the majority of the buildings date to the 16th and 17th centuries. Initially a defense structure and since the first half of the 14th century the seat of the lords of Carniola, it was since the early 19th century used for various other purposes and today is used as a major cultural venue. The castle is depicted on the city's coat of arms, along with a dragon on top. History View of Ljubljana and its castle, engraving from Topographia Ducatus Carniolae modernae by Johann Weikhard von Valvasor (1679) =Ancient history= According to archeological surveys, the area of the present castle has been settled continuously since 1200 BC,Festival Ljubljana when the first settlements and later fortifications were built. The hill summit probably became a Roman army stronghold after fortifications were built in Illyrian and Celtic times. =Middle Ages= Interior of St. George's Chapel The first Ljubljana Castle is believed to have been a wooden and stone fortification built in the 11th century. The oldest written mention of Ljubljana Castle is inscribed on a parchment sheet Nomina defunctorum (names of the dead), which is kept by the Udine Cathedral Archive and most probably dates to the second half of 1161. It mentions the nobleman Rudolf of Tarcento, a lawyer of the Patriarchate of Aquileia, who had bestowed a canon with 20 farmsteads beside the castle of Ljubljana (castrum Leibach) to the Patriarchate. According to the historian Peter ≈†tih's deduction, this happened between 1112 and 1125. Until 1144 the castle became property of the House of Sponheim. In 1256, Ljubljana Castle was mentioned in a document as the most important castle of the rulers of Carniola (). In the late 1270, it was conquered by King Ottokar II of Bohemia. In 1278, after the defeat of Ottokar, it became property of Rudolph of Habsburg. In the 15th century it was almost completely demolished and rebuilt with a complete wall and towers at the entrance, where a drawbridge was placed. St. George's Chapel was also built at that time. In the 16th and 17th centuries, other objects were gradually built. The castle's purpose was to defend the empire against Ottoman invasion as well as peasant revolt. =Baroque period= Courtyard of Ljubljana Castle In the 17th and 18th centuries, the castle became an arsenal. In 1797 the town of Ljubljana and the castle were occupied for the first time by the French army, and again in 1809. In the period of the Illyrian Provinces, the castle was used as barracks and a military hospital. In 1815, back in the Austrian Empire, it became a prison, which it remained until 1895, with a hiatus between 1848 and 1868, resuming that function during World War II. The castle's Viewing Tower dates to 1848; this was inhabited by a guard whose duty it was to fire cannons warning the city in case of fire or announcing important visitors or events. Because it was not a home of a ruler or another important noble person and because a fortification in the area was no longer required, the castle started to lose its importance. The maintenance costs were too high so the castle began to crumble. In the 19th century, the castle was redesigned partially as a prison and partially as a military stronghold, making it less popular among the citizens. Several famous people were jailed in the castle, including the Italian revolutionary Silvio Pellico, the Hungarian Prime Minister Lajos Batthyany and the Slovene author Ivan Cankar. The castle and the dragon are depicted on Ljubljana's coat of arms In 1905, the castle was bought by Municipality of Ljubljana for 60,200 Kronen, on the explicit wish of the mayor, Ivan Hribar, who planned to establish a city museum in it. The plan was however not carried out. Instead, the city decided to settle poor families into it. The residents stayed there until 1963, when preparations for renovation of the castle began. The remains of the fortifications on Castle Hill were reworked in the 1930s a promenade called ≈†ance, designed by the Slovenian architect Jo≈æe Pleƒçnik. =Contemporary history= Medieval bay windows at the southern side Extensive renovation works commenced in the late 1960s; lasting more than 35 years. In the 1990s, the castle began to be used as a place for weddings and cultural events. In 1974, a monument by the sculptor Stojan Batiƒç dedicated to the Slovene peasant revolts (especially to the Slovene peasant revolt of 1515 and the Croatian and Slovenian peasant revolt of 1573) was erected in the vicinity of the castle. The Ljubljana Castle funicular, a funicular railway to the top of Castle Hill, was built in 2006 and began service on 28 December 2006. Architecture Facade of the Castle of Ljubljana. Castle of Ljubljana from the air. Today the castle consists of the following buildings. To the right of the entrance is the Archers Tower, next to it is the gunpowder store, later are the dungeon and the Tower of Erasmus named after the infamous robber-knight Erazem Lueger and the master of the Predjama castle, the former prison for the nobles, at last is the information center. To the courtyard surround the Estate Hall and the Palatium, two buildings with the rooms destined to concerts and gala receptions. Next to it is Fridericks Tower, Kazemate, the chapel of St. George and the panoramic tower in which is the virtual Museum. In the old gunpowder store the permanent exhibition The Slovenian history was opened in 2010. Next to it are located the Hall of Hribar, that in the past was used like the store of arms, and the Pentagonal Tower. To the left of the entrance is the only contemporary building, built in the 80's of last century, in which there are two wedding rooms, cafeteria and souvenir shop. Visitors to the castle can go down to the gallery 'S', several rooms and the cisterns that are under the patio. Below the level of the patio is also the upper funicular station . The funicular was built in 2006, but the idea about the connection between the city and the castle goes back to the end of the century, when Ivan Hribar was mayor of Ljubljana. The funicular rises up the hill along the wall that connected the medieval city with the castle. The length of the tracks between the lower station in Krekov and the upper station in Ljubljana Castle is 117.69 meters. The difference in height is 69.70 meters. The capacity of the funicular is 500 people per hour in one direction. The castle can be accessed by road, by several trails through the forest that surrounds it, or by the funicular. The castle is an attractive tourist spot and hosts a large number of cultural events, weddings, concerts, theater functions, exhibitions, congresses and protocol receptions. =Entrance to the castle complex= The current entrance to the castle represents a bridge, built in the seventeenth century, when the wall of the castle was pierced in this part. It is mentioned as the main entrance of the castle from the year 1815. The original wooden bridge existed until the beginning of the 19th century, when the defense pit was filled. During the later remodeling and rediscovery of the transverse moat on the side of the castle, it was restored its medieval appearance of yesteryear with the construction of the current bridge, which connects the grove of the castle with the building itself. The present form of the entrance was born on the basis of the idea of the architect Boris Kobe. On the right side of the curved entrance to the courtyard of the castle is a sculpture of the legendary dragon-symbol of Ljubljana, originally from the city of Kropa. It was sculpted by Jo≈æe Bertoncelj (1901-1976). A reminder plaque recalls the raw wartime and the names of the fallen in the castle of Ljubljana. = Archers' Tower = The bases date back to the 15th century; the smaller tower was built in the 16th century, then its height was elevated. In the past it served as a powder store and from the outside it is possible to see clearly the openings from where it was fired. From the tower ran a protective wall to the Padav Tower (present ≈†ance) and from there to the Pisana vrata door (colorful door) - in the current street Gornji trg. Between 1946 and 1953 the tower was remodeled under the direction of Boris Kobe. On the ground floor there was a brewery, on the upper floor a coffee shop. Kobe dedicated himself especially to the decoration of the interiors. Together with the painter Marij Pregelj (1913-1967) they laid the foundations for sgraffito images. Artists created the images together, so it is difficult to differentiate between the two authors. Some images, unfortunately not all, have an initial K or P. The images run on a wide ribbon around the circular tower, with interruptions in the openings (windows, doors). The images are framed and make up a story with continued episodes. Below the different images texts are presented. The motifs of the images are taken from popular Slovenian themes: Ro≈°lin and Verjanko (ballad), Mada Zora (ballad), Lepa Vida (ballad), Desetnica (ballad), Povodni mo≈æ (mythology) and Zverina premagana (song about animals).

The panoramic Terrace rises on the medieval wall and served as a summer recreation spot, after the shooter tower was converted into a restaurant. = The prison and the vine of the castle = The prison space of the castle lies between the castle wall and the natural rock. The prison was only accessed from the level of the patio, which means that the prisoners were lowered to the pit by a rope or a chain. In a small space the prisoners with their ankles chained waited for the sentence to pass. The sources indicate that in this space was enclosed Turkish soldiers made prisoners, Protestants and insurgent peasants. The space had no roof, there would be a fence over the prisoners' heads. The number of people locked up at the same time is unknown. What is known is that living conditions were drastic, since in this small space all basic needs (food and defecation) were developed. The sun's rays came in through the roof, as well as the snow in winter. Also a vine found its place in the castle of Ljubljana. It was planted on 30.9.1990 as a symbol of the friendship between the cities of Ljubljana and Maribor. It is known that the vine preserved in Lent is the oldest vine cultivated in the world, since it has more than four hundred years. The variety is called modra kavƒçina or ≈æametna ƒçrnina. The wine association of Maribor has a strict regulation on who is given an outbreak, previously confirming the characteristics of the soil and the manager. The friendship between Slovenian towns and villages, as well as between European cities, is created by giving an outbreak, as the vineyard grows, among others, also in Paris (Mus√©e du vin). =The Tower of Erasmus= The tower, baptized in memory of the knight and bandit Erazem Lueger also known as Erazem Predjamski of the Luegger family, served, according to archaeologists' assumptions, as an aristocratic prison. In the walls it is possible to see engraved with messages manuscripts and graphs, between which also is the year 1442. One of the shields would belong to Erasmo Jamski. The noble Erasmus, rich lord and owner of numerous castles, at a gala dinner, stabbed an army commander in a rage. As this would probably not be an isolated incident, the then territorial governor, Kri≈°tof von Thein, decided to lock him up. He spent a couple of weeks in prison with his brother. Erasmo's life story did not end in prison at the castle of Ljubljana, as he managed to escape. No one understood how he did it, since the castle was solidly protected, the drawbridge lifted at night, so that escape was practically impossible. The most likely hypothesis is that the rich man has bribed the guard, who showed him a secret exit. In this way Erasmus returned to his castle of Predjama. =Kazemate= The name (in German, Kasematten) is already mentioned in the plans that date of the years 1815 and 1816. The original (medieval) purpose of that space was of protection against attacks with cannons. This space served until the fifteenth century as an extension of the main entrance next to the Tower of Whistles and a passage between Bastille to the Tower of Federick and the courtyard of the castle. In the nineteenth century this space was leveled and intended as a bedroom for the condemned. After it is no longer used as a prison, it becomes a simple warehouse or deposit for firewood. Of all the spaces of the castle it is the one that less arranged experienced and thanks to its elongated and high form, it gave the sensation to be the hall of the gentlemen; and just as such the inhabitants of the castle mistakenly called it. = Castle Chapel of St George = On the basis of a document of the year 1489 emitted by the emperor was consecrated to St. George, St. Pancracio and the Empress Helena. The original entrance to the chapel was in the north; it was reached along thirteen steps and is in use to this day. Later it was reached the original Gothic chapel had openings in the ceiling, counted on four gothic windows and a balcony from which the nobles listened to the Holy Mass. This construction was restored in Baroque style and in the year 1747 they reflected in her images of the shields of the governors. The function of the latter enters into history in parallel with the formation of nations, at the end of the thirteenth century. =The Panoramic Tower= After the departure of the French, the Tower of Whistles (actually collapsed by itself) collapsed, placing, two years later, in the place of the old defense tower, a wooden tower destined for the emission of signals in case of fire. The old wooden tower was replaced during the years 1845 and 1848 by a masonry. The tower included a home for the fire watchman who with gunfire warned of fires in the city. The present panoramic tower was elevated 1.20 m. in the year 1982. To the top leads a double spiral staircase, recalling the time when it was part of a fortress in which logistics required soldiers not to cross on the stairs. Currently the tower is an attractive panoramic point for local and foreign visitors. In good weather you can see the Julian Alps and Kamnik- Savinja, as well as the Karavanke chain and the nearby mountains. The tower is open every day of the year. =Gallery \\"S\\" and the small cistern= The elongated and rectangular space below the level of the castle courtyard arose from the construction of the service areas of the castle of Ljubljana. In this space the method of collecting water is represented archaeologically. The top of the cistern can be seen in the courtyard of the castle, in the part of stone is inscribed in the year 1588. The cistern lid was moved in the twentieth century from the garden of the Ursuline nuns of Ljubljana. On the floor below the patio is possible to enter the environment in which the water (rain or snow) filtered into the so-called filtration pit. In the center of the filtration pit is the 1m collection hole. diameter; there it was possible to obtain potable water also in times of drought. Water droplets-source of life were shaped by the artist Tanja Pak. = Hribar Hall and Armoury = The Weapons Room (space on the ground floor) is located between the pentagonal tower and the gunpowder store. It would have been built in 1524 according to the wishes of Emperor Ferdinand. It also served as a stable, barn and dwelling for the soldiers who gathered in the castle. The Sala de Hribar is located on the first floor and was named after the Mayor Ivan Hribar. At the time of its mandate the city received numerous news and acquisitions: the canalization, the first hydroelectric power station, the first public transport to electricity - the tram; 16 of May 1905 the city council bought the castle of Ljubliana. = Pentagonal Tower = The tower served in the fifteenth century as the main entrance to the patio of the catillo. The inhabitants before it were connected with the outside world by means of two drawbridges that crossed the defense pit. On the outside stood a hill, Lipnik, made artificially as tall as the upper openings. Different openings can also be seen for the firing of weapons, since the fortress was adapted to the most modern weapons. In the upper floor was the house of the manager of the building. The currently renovated tower has no roof and is intended for exhibitions, minor concerts and plays. In front of the entrance to the tower there is a silhouette of another cistern on the ground. It served as a cistern or a secret exit of the castle. = Rock Hall = Today it is a space for gastronomy, having received its name from the imposing rocks in the center of the room, which represent the geological structure of the castle hill. The entrance to the room is located under the bridge of the castle or under the double spiral staircases of the gastronomic place. As confirmed by the archaeological findings, in this part of the castle of Ljubljana, between the Tower of the shooters and the pentagonal Tower, stood the old room just in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The plans of the early nineteenth century describe this space as a warehouse of firewood for guards and prison administrators. This area was renovated in the early nineties and is, at the same time, the first major renovation of the castle in Ljubljana. = Castle Courtyard = In the embrace of the wall and the towers, the space of the inner courtyard of the castle is ideal for various events. The story confirms that it was used for the gathering of the army of the nobility, since there was not enough room in the city. At a time when the provincial prison (1813-1945) was here, the courtyard was used as a walking space, the prisoners in the shade of the chestnut trees performed their daily tasks. The traces of the last reforms play with the Gothic and Baroque architectural forms of that time, also inserting modern elements. The current courtyard is a dynamic meeting point - a point through which it is possible to reach all the inner spaces of the castle.

Career Ceccarini was born in Livorno. During the 1997‚Äì98 Serie A season, Ceccarini was at the centre of a controversial decision in Juventus's Derby d'Italia match in Turin against Inter on 26 April 1998: a collision that occurred between Inter striker Ronaldo and Juventus defender Mark Iuliano in the Juventus penalty area, which saw both players go to ground, led the Inter players to claim what they felt to be a clear penalty for a tackle of obstruction, but Ceccarini let the play continue as the players continued to protest; to add to the controversy, Juventus were awarded a contested penalty only thirty seconds later. Although Juventus did not convert the penalty successfully, they still ended up winning the match 1‚Äì0, and went on to win the league title mathematically two days later, following a 3‚Äì2 home win against Bologna, with Inter finishing in second place. Following the match Ceccarini came out publicly and stated that he had made a mistake, and that he should have called the foul and assigned a penalty to Inter for the challenge, although that, at the time, he did not witness the entire play that led to the incident, only the collision between the two players, which drew further criticism from the press. Up to this day, the incident has therefore acquired a degree of infamy, and is still widely debated in the Italian media, and often cited in newspapers. When asked about the episode in a 2009 interview, however, Ceccarini changed his view and said that in hindsight he would have not awarded a penalty, but instead an indirect free kick to Inter inside the penalty area for obstruction. In an even more recent interview with the newspaper Il Tirreno in 2016, however, Ceccarini later further clarified, \\"From the images it is clear that Ronaldo runs into Iuliano, not vice versa: as a matter of fact, the Juventus player falls backwards, resulting from the impact of Ronaldo running into him. I was on the pitch, a few meters away. The intention of the defender was to stop the attacker's progression, but the attacker moved the ball and the defender did not follow it. Iuliano was stationary at the moment of contact, there are no doubts about this. I told Pagliuca [Inter's goalkeeper] that in basketball this would be an offensive foul. Perhaps I ought to have blown a foul in favour of Juventus\\". In 1996 he refereed one match in the 1996 UEFA European Football Championship in England.Naskrent, Gwidon S. \\"EURO 1996 finals\\".

Flint, Michigan is a city which previously relied on its auto industry, and still does to an extent. Over the past several decades, General Motors plants in Genesee County have experienced re-namings, management shifts, openings, closures, reopenings, and spinoffs.

This was the largest GM complex in the world. Buick originally opened in Flint on West Kearsley Street; this plant was repurposed as the first Chevrolet factory after the Hamilton Avenue site opened. In 1983 Buick announced plans for Buick City (inspired by Toyota's \\"Toyota City\\" plant), which would combine Buick's assembly and Fisher #1's bodybuilding operations. The production of rear-wheel drive cars at Buick's Hamilton Avenue plant ended. After gutting the interior, installing robots (and other retooling), and the construction of a new body shop and just-in-time delivery docks, Buick City began building front-wheel drive vehicles in 1985. Buick Motor Division became a marketing and public-relations entity in 1984, when the Buick- Oldsmobile-Cadillac Group (BOC) was created and took over engineering and assembly control from Buick, Oldsmobile, Cadillac and the GM Assembly Division. GM created the Flint Automotive Division to manage BOC's activities in Genesee County, which included the former Buick factories and engineering. BOC dissolved in 1992, and eventually its functions were transferred to the Cadillac/Luxury Car Division (not to be confused with the Cadillac Motor Car Division, the traditional Cadillac operation). Buick City closed in June 1999. It (and other former Buick buildings not technically part of Buick City) was demolished from 2001 to 2003. The Buick Motor Division administration moved to Detroit in 1998. The 1960s-era former Buick world headquarters, after briefly housing EDS workers until 2003, was demolished in 2006. The adjacent former Buick transmission, transmission-parts, engine-assembly and engine-parts plants (GM Powertrain and Flint North) closed by December 2010. =AC Spark Plug Division/Delphi Corporation= ;Industrial Avenue plant Built before 1912, it replaced the original 1908 operation inside a Buick building. It closed about 1976, and was demolished shortly thereafter. ;Dort Highway plant and division HQ/Delphi Flint East This plant manufactured spark plugs, air, oil and fuel filters, instrument clusters and other parts. It opened around the mid-1920s in the former Dort (automobile) plant. The Dort Highway plant became known as Flint East when AC took over the old Chevrolet manufacturing operations on Chevrolet Avenue in 1987. In 1988 AC Spark Plug merged with GM's Rochester Products Division, and was renamed AC Rochester. World headquarters remained in Flint, soon moving to the Great Lakes Technology Center. In the late 1980s, parts of Flint East were turned over to GM's Delco Electronics. In 1994, AC Rochester merged with Delco Remy and became the short-lived AC Delco Systems. 1995 saw the creation of Delphi Automotive Systems (which took over Flint East), and in 1999 GM spun off Delphi. Spark-plug production ended at Flint East in early 2006. Under an agreement reached by Delphi, General Motors, and the United Auto Workers in June 2007 Flint East and two other plants would remain open, operated by GM or a third party designated by GM. Hourly employment at the plant at that time had diminished to approximately 1,100 people. A GM Service Parts Operations packaging and processing center has opened in the easternmost plant in the complex, on Davison Road in Burton. A spokesman for GM confirmed in February 2013 that Delphi Flint East will close in November 2013; the factory building is owned by DPH Holdings, while the equipment is owned by Delphi. =Chevrolet Motor Division= ;Flint Manufacturing Div./Delphi Flint West/Flint Tool and Die 8x10 black and white photograph of the Flint Wagon Works which became a Chevrolet factory The plant opened on Wilcox Street, later renamed Chevrolet Avenue, about 1913, comprising the Motor Division (engine-assembly and engine-parts plants) and the Pressed Metal Division (parts plants) and the pre-World War II Chevrolet Assembly (Plant Two) and Fisher Body #2 plants (later Chevrolet Plant 2A). It was located at the corner of Kearsley Street and Wilcox Street.Location of Flint Michigan Chevrolet Factory circa 1913Beginnings of Flint MI Chevrolet factory This was also originally known as the Flint Wagon WorksOriginal Buick Factory location before it was relocated to its current location, known as Buick City. In 1984, due to smaller sales of four-cylinder engines, the Chevrolet Flint Motor Plant (Plant Four) closed after millions of dollars in improvements several years earlier. The same year, the newly created Chevrolet-Pontiac-Canada Group briefly took over Chevrolet Manufacturing from Chevrolet Motor Division; soon, the newly formed Fisher Guide Division acquired the complex. Around 1987, the Chevrolet plant was taken over by AC Spark Plug and became AC Spark Plug Flint West. In 1988 it became AC Rochester Flint West, and in 1994 AC Delco Systems Flint West. In early 1995, it was renamed Delphi Flint West. Around this time, the plant complex (known as \\"Chevy in the Hole\\") began to disappear. Among the first plants to go were the truck garage, Plant 5 (formerly Engine Parts) and the administration building. This continued until 2004, when Plant Four (which had reopened some years after it initially closed in 1984) shut down and was demolished. Plant Four's last products were generators and fuel filters. The only remaining buildings are Building 35 and Plant 38. Building 35 (originally housing new-car delivery and, later, heat treatment) was donated to Kettering University (originally General Motors Institute) in 1996. After the addition of another floor and a new facade, it houses the university's Mechanical Engineering and Chemistry Center. Workers in Building 35 built the first Corvette prototype, around 1953. Plant 38 (the Die and Engineering Center) opened in 1967, is still operated by GM and is known as Flint Tool and Die. According to GM‚Äôs website, at Flint Tool and Die there are 228 hourly and 25 salaried workers.GM Global Operations - US Facilities: Flint Tool & Die The rest of the land is being redeveloped to be turned into a public park for the City of Flint. The park will be called \\"Chevy Commons\\". ;Flint Assembly Division/Flint Truck Assembly Opened on Van Slyke Road in 1947 for car and truck assembly, in 1970 Chevrolet Assembly converted to truck-only production and GM created the Truck and Bus Group in 1981. The GM Assembly Division then transferred the Chevrolet Flint Assembly plant to Truck and Bus, which was later renamed North American Truck Platforms and then the GM Truck Group. Now known as Flint Assembly, it remains an important operation for GM; it builds Chevrolet Kodiak and GMC TopKick commercial trucks, and Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra full-size pickup trucks. In December 2004, GM announced it would invest $150 million into retooling at this plant. After a maximum of at least 8,000 workers at Fisher 2 and Chevrolet Assembly, 1,862 hourly and 185 salaried employees work there.GM News- United States] Events at this plant during the late 1970s are chronicled in Ben Hamper's 1991 book Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line. ;Flint Frame and Stamping Plant/Flint Metal Center/Flint Metal Fabrication Div. On Bristol Road, it opened in 1954. Operated by the Chevrolet-Pontiac-Canada Group from 1984 to 1992 and eventually by the Metal Fabricating Division, the plant is now known as the GM Flint Metal Center. GM has spent over $60 million upgrading the plant in recent years. 2,000 hourly and 180 salaried workers are there today.GM Global Operations - US Facilities: Flint Metal Center ;Flint V8 Engine Plant/Flint Engine South On Van Slyke Road, it opened around 1953, closed around 1999 and was soon demolished. Immediately south of it, GM built the $500 million Flint Engine South (now known as Flint Engine Operations) to build the Atlas L6 Engine plant which opened in 2000. A $300 million addition, recently opened, builds the High Feature V6 engine engines.GM Global Operations - US Facilities: GMPT Flint Engine South The land where the V8 Plant once stood is now home to the GM Paint plant section of Flint Assembly. ;National Parts Distribution/Service Parts Operations On Bristol Road in Swartz Creek, it opened in 1957. It merged with other car divisions' parts operations in 1969 and was renamed the GM Parts Division (later Warehousing and Distribution). During the late 1990s, GM's worldwide parts purchasing and distribution office headquarters moved from here to a new building in Grand Blanc Township. Known as Service Parts Operations-Flint, the Swartz Creek facility remains open with a large amount of vacant office space. Currently, 595 hourly and 70 salaried workers are employed at SPO Flint. In May 2014, GM invested $10 million in upgrading the appearance and quality of the plant. Recently, a new processing/packaging center has opened on Davison Road in Burton, in a former AC Spark Plug (later Delphi) plant.GM Global Operations - US Facilities: SPO Flint =Fisher Body Division= ;Flint Plant #1 A 1925 Flint car at a 2008 rally in Perth, Western Australia This plant was located on South Saginaw Street, and manufactured Buick bodies and pressed-metal parts. GM bought the plant from Durant Motors before 1935; it had opened in the early 1920s as Durant Motors headquarters, producing the \\"Flint\\" car. In 1984, Fisher #1 became BOC Flint Body Assembly. After Buick ceased building rear-wheel-drive cars and Buick City got underway, BOC Flint Body Assembly earned a reprieve by building bodies which were shipped to GM assembly operations in Pontiac, Michigan until the plant closed in December 1987. Most of it was demolished in 1988, except for portions which were gutted and transformed into the Great Lakes Technology Center; the original administration building remains intact. GM initially had substantial office and engineering operations at the GLTC (including AC Rochester world headquarters), but eventually transferred those staffs elsewhere. ;Flint Plant #2 This plant opened on Van Slyke Road in 1947 (on the same site as the Chevrolet Assembly plant), and made Chevrolet bodies; it was dissolved in 1970. ;Grand Blanc Plant/Grand Blanc Weld Tool Center On South Saginaw Street, it manufactured pressed-metal parts. Opened in 1942, it originally built tanks for World War II and is still sometimes called the \\"Tank Plant\\". It was transferred to BOC in 1984, and later to the newly formed Cadillac/Luxury Car Division (not to be confused with the Cadillac Motor Car Division). Most recently operated by the Metal Fabricating Division, this plant has recently all but eliminated its metal stamping operations and now serves as a corporation-wide weld-tooling center. According to GM‚Äôs website, 411 hourly and 29 salaried workers are at Grand Blanc today.GM - Grand Blanc Tool Weld Center Info GM announced in January 2013 that Grand Blanc Weld Tool would close to an extent in six months. Currently, it has been speculated that GM will redevelop the plant for larger operations and future use. =Ternstedt Division= ;Coldwater Road Plant In Genesee Township, it opened to manufacture body hardware around 1953. The plant was originally intended to build aircraft engines for Buick during the Korean War, but never did. In 1969, Ternstedt Division merged with Fisher Body Division (its original parent), which was dissolved in 1984 when its Coldwater Road plant was turned over to the newly formed Fisher Guide Division. Fisher Guide became Inland Fisher Guide Division in 1989. The Coldwater Road plant was renamed again in 1995, when the newly formed Delphi Automotive Systems took over. Finally, in 1996 Delphi sold the Coldwater Road factory to Peregrine Inc, which attempted to make the plant profitable before closing it around 1998. It was soon demolished. Roger & Me Roger & Me is a 1989 American documentary film directed by Flint area native Michael Moore. Moore portrays the regional economic impact of General Motors CEO Roger Smith's action of closing several auto plants in his hometown of Flint, Michigan, reducing GM's employees in that area from 80,000 in 1978 to about 50,000 in 1992.

Vargas Vila was an autodidact, who, from an early age, participated in political struggles as a journalist, political agitator, and orator. He was considered one of the most controversial writers in the Americas at the beginning of 20th century. Vargas Vila distinguished himself through his radically liberal ideas and his criticism the Catholic clergy, conservatism, and the imperialist policies of the United States. Many of his ideas approached those of existentialism and were claimed to be libertarian, although they were so close to anarchism that at one time even Vargas Vila declared himself an anarchist. He defended all causes and individuals who fought for their peoples' liberty and justice, especially in Latin America, without harping on whether they all shared his exact same philosophy, and knowing that they did not. The publication of his novel Ibis in 1900 caused him to be excommunicated by the Holy See, a development that pleased him.elcolombiano.com  Bibliography  * Aura o las violetas. 1887 * Pasionarias, √°lbum para mi madre muerta. 1887. * Emma, Maracaibo. 1888 (En una publicaci√≥n literaria). * Aura o las violetas; Emma. 1889. * Lo irreparable. 1889. * Los Providenciales. 1892. * Flor de fango. 1895. * Ibis. 1900. * A la hora del crep√∫sculo. 1900?. * Alba roja, Par√≠s. 1901. * Las rosas de la tarde. 1901. * Ante los b√°rbaros: el Yanki.

In 1948, he won the Rome Prize and spent some time living in Italy. During the 1950s, he learned welding, and in 1960 took to sculpture in preference to painting, and became a teacher. He has taught at Hornsey College of Art and Design, and from 1963 until his retirement from teaching in 1995 he taught sculpture at the Royal College of Art. He was also Master and later Professor of Sculpture at the Royal Academy between 1982 and 1990. In addition to his teaching, numerous exhibitions of his own painting and sculpture work have been held since 1953, and his works are displayed in countries such as Australia, Brazil, New Zealand and the United States. In the USA, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City includes examples of his work amongst its public collections. He was awarded a Leverhulme Trust Prize in 1952, as well as the Daily Express Young Painters' Prize (1955) and an Arts Council Purchase Award (1969). After a successful solo show at the Whitechapel Gallery in 1966, Kneale became the first abstract sculptor to be elected a Royal Academician in 1974. He accepted the honour only on the condition that he be allowed to curate a show of contemporary sculpture which resulted in a groundbreaking survey of some of the period's most exciting sculptors. Kneale is the younger brother of the screenwriter Nigel Kneale (1922-2006), best known for his Quatermass television serials. Kneale illustrated the covers for Penguin Books' releases of his elder brother's Quatermass scripts in 1960. He was also responsible for a painting of a lobster from which BBC special effects designers Bernard Wilkie and Jack Kine drew their inspiration for the Martian creatures they constructed for Quatermass and the Pit (1958-59). For his sculpture Capt Quilliam, he received the 2007 Marsh Award for Excellence in Public Sculpture. He was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2019 New Year Honours, for services to British Art. He currently lives in London.

Under the identification of a circle with R/Z, or with the interval [0, 1] with the boundary points glued together, this map becomes a rotation of a circle by a proportion Œ∏ of a full revolution (i.e., an angle of 2œÄŒ∏ radians). Since Œ∏ is irrational, the rotation has infinite order in the circle group and the map TŒ∏ has no periodic orbits. Alternatively, we can use multiplicative notation for an irrational rotation by introducing the map : T_\\\\theta :S^1 \\\\to S^1, \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad T_\\\\theta(x)=xe^{2\\\\pi i\\\\theta} The relationship between the additive and multiplicative notations is the group isomorphism : \\\\varphi:([0,1],+) \\\\to (S^1, \\\\cdot) \\\\quad \\\\varphi(x)=xe^{2\\\\pi i\\\\theta}.

E., & Hanson, L. (1972). Negativity in evaluations. In E. E. Jones, D. E. Kanouse, S. Valins, H. H. Kelley, R. E. Nisbett, & B. Weiner (Eds.), Attribution: Perceiving the causes of behavior. Morristown, NJ: General Learning Press. also known as the negativity effect, is the notion that, even when of equal intensity, things of a more negative nature (e.g. unpleasant thoughts, emotions, or social interactions; harmful/traumatic events) have a greater effect on one's psychological state and processes than neutral or positive things. In other words, something very positive will generally have less of an impact on a person's behavior and cognition than something equally emotional but negative. The negativity bias has been investigated within many different domains, including the formation of impressions and general evaluations; attention, learning, and memory; and decision-making and risk considerations. Explanations Paul Rozin and Edward Royzman proposed four elements of the negativity bias in order to explain its manifestation: negative potency, steeper negative gradients, negativity dominance, and negative differentiation. Negative potency refers to the notion that, while possibly of equal magnitude or emotionality, negative and positive items/events/etc. are not equally salient. Rozin and Royzman note that this characteristic of the negativity bias is only empirically demonstrable in situations with inherent measurability, such as comparing how positively or negatively a change in temperature is interpreted. With respect to positive and negative gradients, it appears to be the case that negative events are thought to be perceived as increasingly more negative than positive events are increasingly positive the closer one gets (spatially or temporally) to the affective event itself. In other words, there is a steeper negative gradient than positive gradient. For example, the negative experience of an impending dental surgery is perceived as increasingly more negative the closer one gets to the date of surgery than the positive experience of an impending party is perceived as increasingly more positive the closer one gets to the date of celebration (assuming for the sake of this example that these events are equally positive and negative). Rozin and Royzman argue that this characteristic is distinct from that of negative potency because there appears to be evidence of steeper negative slopes relative to positive slopes even when potency itself is low. Negativity dominance describes the tendency for the combination of positive and negative items/events/etc. to skew towards an overall more negative interpretation than would be suggested by the summation of the individual positive and negative components. Phrasing in more Gestalt- friendly terms, the whole is more negative than the sum of its parts. Negative differentiation is consistent with evidence suggesting that the conceptualization of negativity is more elaborate and complex than that of positivity. For instance, research indicates that negative vocabulary is more richly descriptive of the affective experience than that of positive vocabulary. Furthermore, there appear to be more terms employed to indicate negative emotions than positive emotions.Averill, J. R., (1980). On the paucity of positive emotions. In K. R. Blankstein, P. Pliner, & J. Polivy (Eds.), Advances in the study of communication and affect, Vol. 6 (p. 745). New York: Plenum. The notion of negative differentiation is consistent with the mobilization-minimization hypothesis, which posits that negative events, as a consequence of this complexity, require a greater mobilization of cognitive resources to deal with the affective experience and a greater effort to minimize the consequences. Evidence =Social judgments and impression formation= Most of the early evidence suggesting a negativity bias stems from research on social judgments and impression formation, in which it became clear that negative information was typically more heavily weighted when participants were tasked with forming comprehensive evaluations and impressions of other target individuals. Generally speaking, when people are presented with a range of trait information about a target individual, the traits are neither \\"averaged\\" nor \\"summed\\" to reach a final impression. When these traits differ in terms of their positivity and negativity, negative traits disproportionately impact the final impression.Feldman, S. (1966). Motivational aspects of attitudinal elements and their place in cognitive interaction. In S. Feldman (Ed.), Cognitive consistency: Motivational antecedents and behavioral consequences (pp. 75‚Äì108). New York: Academic Press. This is specifically in line with the notion of negativity dominance (see \\"Explanations\\" above). As an example, a famous study by Leon Festinger and colleagues investigated critical factors in predicting friendship formation; the researchers concluded that whether or not people became friends was most strongly predicted by their proximity to one another.Festinger, L., Schacter, S., & Back, K. (1950). Social pressures in informal groups: A study of a housing community. Palo Alto, CA: Stanford University Press. Ebbesen, Kjos, and Konecni, however, demonstrated that proximity itself does not predict friendship formation; rather, proximity serves to amplify the information that is relevant to the decision of either forming or not forming a friendship. Negative information is just as amplified as positive information by proximity. As negative information tends to outweigh positive information, proximity may predict a failure to form friendships even more so than successful friendship formation. One explanation that has been put forth as to why such a negativity bias is demonstrated in social judgments is that people may generally consider negative information to be more diagnostic of an individual's character than positive information, that it is more useful than positive information in forming an overall impression. This is supported by indications of higher confidence in the accuracy of one's formed impression when it was formed more on the basis of negative traits than positive traits. People consider negative information to be more important to impression formation and, when it is available to them, they are subsequently more confident. An oft-cited paradox, a dishonest person can sometimes act honestly while still being considered to be predominantly dishonest; on the other hand, an honest person who sometimes does dishonest things will likely be reclassified as a dishonest person. It is expected that a dishonest person will occasionally be honest, but this honesty will not counteract the prior demonstrations of dishonesty. Honesty is considered more easily tarnished by acts of dishonesty. Honesty itself would then be not diagnostic of an honest nature, only the absence of dishonesty. The presumption that negative information has greater diagnostic accuracy is also evident in voting patterns. Voting behaviors have been shown to be more affected or motivated by negative information than positive: people tend to be more motivated to vote against a candidate because of negative information than they are to vote for a candidate because of positive information. As noted by researcher Jill Klein, \\"character weaknesses were more important than strengths in determining...the ultimate vote\\". This diagnostic preference for negative traits over positive traits is thought to be a consequence of behavioral expectations: there is a general expectation that, owing to social requirements and regulations, people will generally behave positively and exhibit positive traits. Contrastingly, negative behaviors/traits are more unexpected and, thus, more salient when they are exhibited. The relatively greater salience of negative events or information means they ultimately play a greater role in the judgment process. Attribution of Intentions Studies reported in a paper in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General by Carey Morewedge (2009) found that people exhibit a negativity bias in attribution of external agency, such that they are more likely to attribute negative outcomes to the intentions of another person than similar neutral and positive outcomes. In laboratory experiments, Morewedge found that participants were more likely to believe that a partner had influenced the outcome of a gamble in when the participants lost money than won money, even when the probability of winning and losing money was held even. This bias is not limited to adults. Children also appear to be more likely to attribute negative events to intentional causes than similarly positive events. =Cognition= As addressed by negative differentiation, negative information seems to require greater information processing resources and activity than does positive information; people tend to think and reason more about negative events than positive events. Neurological differences also point to greater processing of negative information: participants exhibit greater event-related potentials when reading about, or viewing photographs of, people performing negative acts that were incongruent with their traits than when reading about incongruent positive acts. This additional processing leads to differences between positive and negative information in attention, learning, and memory. Attention A number of studies have suggested that negativity is essentially an attention magnet. For example, when tasked with forming an impression of presented target individuals, participants spent longer looking at negative photographs than they did looking at positive photographs. Similarly, participants registered more eye blinks when studying negative words than positive words (blinking rate has been positively linked to cognitive activity). Also, people were found to show greater orienting responses following negative than positive outcomes, including larger increases in pupil diameter, heart rate, and peripheral arterial tone Importantly, this preferential attendance to negative information is evident even when the affective nature of the stimuli is irrelevant to the task itself. The automatic vigilance hypothesis has been investigated using a modified Stroop task. Participants were presented with a series of positive and negative personality traits in several different colors; as each trait appeared on the screen, participants were to name the color as quickly as possible. Even though the positive and negative elements of the words were immaterial to the color-naming task, participants were slower to name the color of negative traits than they were positive traits. This difference in response latencies indicates that greater attention was devoted to processing the trait itself when it was negative. Aside from studies of eye blinks and color naming, Baumeister and colleagues noted in their review of bad events versus good events that there is also easily accessible, real-world evidence for this attentional bias: bad news sells more papers and the bulk of successful novels are full of negative events and turmoil. When taken in conjunction with the laboratory-based experiments, there is strong support for the notion that negative information generally has a stronger pull on attention than does positive information. Learning and memory Learning and memory are direct consequences of attentional processing: the more attention is directed or devoted toward something, the more likely it is that it will be later learned and remembered. Research concerning the effects of punishment and reward on learning suggests that punishment for incorrect responses is more effective in enhancing learning than are rewards for correct responses‚Äîlearning occurs more quickly following bad events than good events. Drs. Pratto and John addressed the effects of affective information on incidental memory as well as attention using their modified Stroop paradigm (see section concerning \\"Attention\\"). Not only were participants slower to name the colors of negative traits, they also exhibited better incidental memory for the presented negative traits than they did for the positive traits, regardless of the proportion of negative to positive traits in the stimuli set. Intentional memory is also impacted by the stimuli's negative or positive quality. When studying both positive and negative behaviors, participants tend to recall more negative behaviors during a later memory test than they do positive behaviors, even after controlling for serial position effects. There is also evidence that people exhibit better recognition memory and source memory for negative information. When asked to recall a recent emotional event, people tend to report negative events more often than they report positive events, and this is thought to be because these negative memories are more salient than are the positive memories. People also tend to underestimate how frequently they experience positive affect, in that they more often forget the positively emotional experiences than they forget negatively emotional experiences. =Decision-making= Studies of the negativity bias have also been related to research within the domain of decision-making, specifically as it relates to risk aversion or loss aversion. When presented with a situation in which a person stands to either gain something or lose something depending on the outcome, potential costs were argued to be more heavily considered than potential gains. The greater consideration of losses (i.e. negative outcomes) is in line with the principle of negative potency as proposed by Rozin and Royzman. This issue of negativity and loss aversion as it relates to decision-making is most notably addressed by Drs. Daniel Kahneman's and Amos Tversky's prospect theory. However, it is worth noting that Rozin and Royzman were never able to find loss aversion in decision making . Quoting their paper \\"in particular, strict gain and loss of money does not reliably demonstrate loss aversion\\". This is consistent with the findings of a recent review of more than 40 studies of loss aversion focusing on decision problems with equal sized gains and losses. In their review, Yechiam and Hochman (2013) did find a positive effect of losses on performance, autonomic arousal, and response time in decision tasks, which they suggested is due to the effect of losses on attention. This was labeled by them as loss attention. Politics Research points to a correlation between political affiliation and negativity bias Hibbing, J. R., Smith, K. B. and Alford, J. R. (2014) ‚ÄúDifferences in negativity bias underlie variations in political ideology,‚Äù Behavioral and Brain Sciences. Cambridge University Press, 37(3), pp. 297‚Äì307. . , where conservatives are more sensitive to negative stimuli and therefore tend to lean towards right-leaning ideology which considers threat reduction and social-order to be its main focus.Schwartz, S. H. (2014) ‚ÄúNegativity bias and basic values,‚Äù Behavioral and Brain Sciences. Cambridge University Press, 37(3), pp. 328‚Äì329. . Individuals with lower negativity bias tend to lean towards liberal political policies such as pluralism and are accepting of diverse social groups which by proxy could threaten social structure and cause greater risk of unrest.Caprara, G. V., Schwartz, S., Capanna, C., Vecchione, M. and Barbaranelli, C. (2006), Personality and Politics: Values, Traits, and Political Choice. Political Psychology, 27: 1‚Äì28. Lifespan development =Infancy= Although most of the research concerning the negativity bias has been conducted with adults (particularly undergraduate students), there have been a small number of infant studies also suggesting negativity biases. Infants are thought to interpret ambiguous situations on the basis of how others around them react. When an adult (e.g. experimenter, mother) displays reactions of happiness, fear, or neutrality towards target toys, infants tend to approach the toy associated with the negative reaction significantly less than the neutral and positive toys. Furthermore, there was greater evidence of neural activity when the infants were shown pictures of the \\"negative\\" toy than when shown the \\"positive\\" and \\"neutral\\" toys. Although recent work with 3-month-olds suggests a negativity bias in social evaluations, as well, there is also work suggesting a potential positivity bias in attention to emotional expressions in infants younger than 7 months. A review of the literature conducted by Drs. Amrisha Vaish, Tobias Grossman, and Amanda Woodward suggests the negativity bias may emerge during the second half of an infant's first year, although the authors also note that research on the negativity bias and affective information has been woefully neglected within the developmental literature. =Aging and older adults= Some research indicates that older adults may display, at least in certain situations, a positivity bias or positivity effect. Proposed by Dr. Laura Carstensen and colleagues, the socioemotional selectivity theory outlines a shift in goals and emotion regulation tendencies with advancing age, resulting in a preference for positive information over negative information. Aside from the evidence in favor of a positivity bias, though, there have still been many documented cases of older adults displaying a negativity bias.Naveh-Benjamin, M., & Ohta, N. (Eds.) (2012).

It has been operating since the early 20th century and is currently owned and operated by Singleton Birch Ltd. The output in 2005 was around 4,000 tonnes of limestone per day, one third of which was supplied to an on-site lime kiln, the remainder being sold as coated or dusted aggregates. The limestone at this site is close to 99% carbonate of calcium and magnesium (dolomite). In former years it was a major supplier of limestone for railway track ballast purposes. A lime-burning kiln at the site was closed for a while in 2006 after testing showed quicklime dust was escaping into the atmosphere. The kiln, which produced 200,000 tonnes of quicklime a year for use in the steel industry, required ¬£300,000 of investment to resolve the problems. The closure followed an earlier warning from the Environment Agency when the company was notified that it should tighten up procedures at the site. Quicklime dust is a health hazard, which in large quantities can cause skin irritation and damage to the eyes and throat. In March 2009 however the lime kiln closed, supposedly indefinitely, following a drop in demand from the site's sole customer, Corus.; the quarry has since been taken over by Melton Ross, Lincolnshire-based Singleton Birch.

He finds work around the Square ‚Äî the money is not great but there are benefits ‚Äî for instance, Julie Cooper (Louise Plowright) discusses his building estimates while sharing a bed with him. He is a ladies man and a heart-breaker, as sixteen-year-old Diane Butcher (Sophie Lawrence) discovers. When their relationship grows too serious, he flees and a devastated Diane runs away from home shortly afterwards. Storylines Originally from Leeds, Paul came to London with a building firm he worked for. He arrives in Walford in April 1989 in search of a place to stay and soon begins lodging with the Butchers at The Queen Victoria public house. Paul has quite an impact on the ladies of Walford, particularly the school girl Diane Butcher (Sophie Lawrence), who is instantly attracted to him. Her father Frank (Mike Reid) becomes extremely worried about all the attention she gives Paul. His fears are mistakenly realised when Paul takes Diane to a Deacon Blue concert and they are both assaulted on their way home by a gang of violent thugs. As the gang team up on Paul, Diane is struck while attempting to fend them off. She runs home to the Vic to get help, however Frank immediately assumes that Paul is the one who has struck her. When Paul escapes the thugs and returns to the Vic, he is greeted by a furious Frank, who knocks him to the floor with a punch. Only after Paul has fled in fear does a hysterical Diane manage to explain what had really occurred. Frank is forced to apologise for his overreaction and as Paul is relatively laid back, he does not bear him any grudges. Paul and Diane begin dating, although spending time alone together is almost impossible with Frank watching their every move, not to mention Mo Butcher (Edna Dor√©) ‚Äî who takes to standing guard outside their bedrooms at night to stop any secret liaisons. While Diane quickly falls in love with Paul, it is not nearly as serious for him. In June 1989 Paul's friend Trevor Short (Phil McDermott) comes to Walford in search of him. He and Trevor had shared a room together briefly at a youth hostel. Trevor is a dim-witted, needy individual who idolises Paul. Paul is not exactly thrilled to see Trevor initially, but soon comes round to the idea of having him around. When Paul decides to take on some freelance work, he employs Trevor as a builder's aid, although he is more of a liability than a labourer and makes many disastrous mistakes. Paul finds a fair bit of work around Walford, his first big job being the conversion of Julie Cooper's (Louise Plowright) salon. Julie takes a shine to Paul and while Diane is waiting for Paul to take her on a romantic date, Julie seduces him and they have sex. Paul continues to mess Diane around, standing her up on several occasions to be with Julie. Diane is devastated by his sudden rejection, but she places the blame entirely on Julie. Meanwhile, Paul soon begins to feel that Julie is merely using him in order to get a cheap deal for his labour and he begins to take against her flirtatious behaviour towards other men. He dumps her and refuses to finish the salon conversion. Julie, who only saw their fling as a bit of fun, is not particularly bothered about the end of their affair, but refuses to pay him for his prior work unless he finishes the salon, so Paul is forced to continue. Immediately after finishing with Julie, Paul returns to Diane and she willingly takes him back. She will not forgive Julie however, and plays various vengeful tricks on her as payback. Paul finds work redecorating Ashraf Karim's (Aftab Sachak) property, which is hindered somewhat by the ineptitude of Trevor, who causes the property's ceiling to collapse. Paul and Diane's relationship continues, but it soon becomes obvious to everyone that Paul is losing interest in her. Oblivious to this, Diane's feelings only strengthen and she even invites him away for a weekend alone together, indicating that sex will be on the agenda. Paul, who still has Frank watching his every move, declines the offer, but Diane is not perturbed and by the end of the year she has got it into her head that Paul wants to marry her. Actually the relationship has grown far too serious for Paul's liking. He begins to tire of living in London and longs for his old life and the people back up north. After finishing the Karim's property he breaks the news that he is leaving to Trevor and hints that it is unlikely he will return. Meanwhile, Diane is adamant that Paul is about to propose and even instructs Trevor to show Paul the engagement ring she wants. Trevor tries to convince Paul to tell Diane that he is leaving, but Paul cannot pluck up the courage to do it and says his goodbyes to everyone but her. Eventually Trevor informs Diane that Paul is leaving and she reacts with anger and disbelief. She goes in search of him and sees him waiting at a bus stop. She calls out to him, but Paul merely glances at her before getting on a bus and leaving. Diane is devastated to lose Paul and in January 1990 (on her sixteenth birthday) she runs away from home without trace. Frank blames Paul for her disappearance and goes to Leeds to track him down, thinking that Diane is with him, but his search is fruitless. He is told that Paul has not been there recently and no one knows where he is. Frank becomes so desperate to find Paul that he hires a private detective, and is in the process of being conned by him when Paul coincidentally turns up in Walford. He reveals that he had spent some time in America, and knows nothing of Diane's whereabouts. He feels guilty about the way he'd treated Diane and has come back to put things right. After some heavy interrogation from Frank, Paul reveals that he spoke to Diane on the day she ran away. She had asked to come to Leeds to see him, but Paul had refused and promised to come to Walford when he had more time. Frank eventually accepts that Paul is telling the truth. Trevor is overjoyed to see Paul again, but his happiness is fleeting as Paul soon announces that he is leaving once again, and this time for good. Seeing how upset Trevor is about this, Paul asks him to join him in his home town of Leeds. Trevor gratefully accepts and leaves with Paul in March 1990.  Character creation and development  1989 was a year of big change for EastEnders, both behind the cameras and in front of them. Original production designer, Keith Harris, left the show, and co-creators, Tony Holland and Julia Smith, both decided that the time had come to move on too; their final contribution coinciding with the exit of one of EastEnders most successful characters, Den Watts (Leslie Grantham). A new producer, Mike Gibbon, was given the arduous task of taking over the show and he enlisted the most experienced writers to take over the storylining of the programme, including Charlie Humphreys, Jane Hollowood and Tony McHale. The departure of two of the soap's most popular characters, Den and Angie Watts (Anita Dobson), had left a massive void in the programme, which needed to be filled. In addition several other long running characters left the show that year including two original cast members, Sue and Ali Osman (Sandy Ratcliff and Nejdet Salih) and their family; Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler); Carmel Jackson (Judith Jacob) and her family and one of the show's more controversial characters, Colin Russell (Michael Cashman). So, it was decided that 1989 was to be a year of change in Walford. EastEnders script-writer, Colin Brake, has suggested that \\"it was almost as if Walford itself was making a fresh start\\". At the time the programme had come under criticism in the British media for being too depressing; arguably a reputation that it has never been able to shake. The programme makers were determined to change this. In 1989 there was a deliberate attempt to increase the lighter, more comic aspects of life in Albert Square. This led to the introduction of some characters who were deliberately conceived as comic or light-hearted. Such characters included Paul Priestly, a northern heartbreaker, and his sidekick Trevor Short (Phil McDermott), \\"the nearest thing to a village idiot that Walford had seen in many years\\"; Julie Cooper (Louise Plowright), the man-mad hairdresser; Marge Green ‚Äî a batty older lady played by veteran comedy actress Pat Coombs; wheeler-dealer Vince Johnson (Hepburn Graham) and Laurie Bates (Gary Powell), who became Pete Beale's (Peter Dean) sparring partner. Paul Priestly was a cheeky, carefree romeo, whose principal purpose was to become Walford's latest teen heartthrob. Since 1985 this role had been occupied by the hugely popular Simon Wicks (Nick Berry), but as the character aged and took on a more mature role, the programme needed a new teen pin-up to appeal to the younger audience. The actor Mark Thrippleton shared many similarities with the character of Paul. Like Paul he came from Leeds, had a strong Yorkshire accent, and before taking up acting he was a builder. As he also looked the part Thrippleton was given the role. Humour was an important element in the storylines during 1989, with a greater amount of slapstick and light comedy than ever before. The character of Paul was regularly used for comic effect in conjunction with his dim-witted sidekick Trevor Short, who Paul compassionately employed as a labourer. Emphasis was placed on the obvious differences between the two friends, as well as Trevor's tendency to idolise Paul and fail at every task he was given. Paul would despair over Trevor's ineptitude, but although Trevor was more of a liability than a labourer, Paul remained his loyal defender and persisted in helping him out and taking responsibility for his errors. 1989's changes were a brave experiment and while some found this period of EastEnders entertaining, many other viewers felt that the comedy stretched the programme's credibility somewhat. Although the programme still covered many issues in 1989, such as domestic violence, drugs, rape and racism, the new emphasis on a more balanced mix between \\"light and heavy storylines\\" gave the illusion that the show had lost a \\"certain edge\\". By the end of the year EastEnders had acquired a new executive producer, Michael Ferguson, who had previously been a successful producer on ITV's The Bill. Ultimately, Ferguson was responsible for bringing in a new sense of vitality, and creating a programme that was more in touch with the real world than it had been over the last year. A new era began in 1990 with the introduction of the Mitchell brothers, Phil (Steve McFadden) and Grant (Ross Kemp), two hugely successful characters, who would go on to dominate the soap thereafter. As the new production machine cleared the way for new characters and a new direction, a number of characters were axed from the show at the start of the year. Among them was Paul, as well as every other \\"comedic\\" character that had been introduced to the show in 1989. By March 1990 they had all gone. Several of the actors were upset to be leaving the programme so soon, but with the show's new direction there was no place for characters \\"whose prime function was to be comic relief\\".

The black comedy focuses on David, a blind Vietnam War veteran who finds himself unable to come to terms with his actions on the battlefield and alienated from his family because they neither can accept his disability nor understand his wartime experience. Rabe explores the conflicted feelings of many civilians during the era by parodying the ideal American family as it was portrayed on the television sitcom The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet. Beneath the perfect facade of the playwright's fictional Nelson family are layers of prejudice, bigotry, and self-hatred that are peeled away slowly as they interact with their physically and emotionally damaged son and brother. History Sticks and Bones was the second play in Rabe's Vietnam trilogy, following The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel and preceding Streamers. A veteran himself, he wrote it while a graduate student at Villanova University, where it was staged in 1969. The off-Broadway production, directed by Jeff Bleckner, opened on November 7, 1971 at Joseph Papp's Public Theater, where it ran for 121 performances. The cast included David Selby as David, Tom Aldredge as Ozzie, Elizabeth Wilson as Harriet (played later by Rue McClanahan), Cliff DeYoung as Rick, and Charles Siebert as Father Donald. Critical reaction and audience response were positive, and Papp decided to move the play uptown. With Drew Snyder replacing Selby but the rest of the cast intact, the Broadway production opened on March 1, 1972 at the John Golden Theatre, where it ran for 246 performances. In 1973, David Rabe wrote the teleplay for and Robert Downey Sr. directed a CBS television movie based on Rabe's play. The cast included DeYoung as David, Aldredge as Ozzie, and Anne Jackson as Harriet.

Lactalbumin is found in the milk of many mammals. There are alpha and beta lactalbumins; both are contained in milk. Targeted small scientific studies suggest that certain types of lactalbumin (whey protein) may improve immune responsiveness and increase levels of glutathione systemically in animals and which apparently possess antiviral (against viruses), anti-apoptotic (impede cell death) and anti-tumor (against cancers or tumors) activities in humans, but larger and better studies are needed to confirm these attributions.

Influence Of Dietary Lactalbumin Hydrolysate On The Immune System Of Mice And Resistance To Salmonellosis Bounous G., Stevenson M.M., Kongshavn P.A. J Infect Dis. Sep; 144(3) :281. (1981) In the present study we investigated the effect of four weeks of treatment with a diet containing lactalbumin hydrolysate (LAH: Nestl√©, Vevey, Switzerland) on the immune response of C3H/HeN mice. Our data indicate that it was possible to increase the level of this type of protein in the diet above the minimum requirement (12% LAH) and thus produce augmented humoral immune responsiveness and resistance to salmonellosis. Lactalbumin = Whey Protein Concentrate 2\\\\. Influence Of Dietary Proteins On The Immune System Of Mice Bounous G., Kongshavn P.A. J Nutr.Sep; 112(9) :1747-55 (1982) The effect of graded amounts of dietary laetalbumin (L) and casein (C) hydrolyzates on the immune responsiveness of C3H/HeN and DBA/2 strain mice has been investigated by measuring both the specific humoral immune response to sheep red blood cells (SRBC) and the nonspecific splenic cell responsiveness to phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A and Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide after stimulation with Mycobacteriurn bovis, strain BCG. The nutritional efficiency of these diets was similar at both 12 and 28% amino acid levels. The immune responses of mice fed the L diets were found to be significantly greater than those of mice fed the corresponding C diets, especially at the 28% level. Furthermore, in the mice fed L diet, increasing the concentration of amino acid in the diet from 12 to 28% greatly enhanced immune responsiveness by both parameters measured. In the C-fed mice, a comparable enhancement of mitogen responsiveness with increasing amino acid level of diet was seen, but there was no change in the humoral immune response. The enhancement of immune responsiveness observed in mice fed the 28% L diet was moderately reduced by the addition of phenylalanine to the diet, indicating that the lower level of this amino acid in the L protein may be of some significance. These dietary effects on immune responsiveness were remarkably similar in both mousestrains tested. 3\\\\. Influence Of Dietary Protein Type On The Immune System Of Mice Bounous G., Letourneau L., Kongshavn P.A. J Nutr. Jul;113(7) :1415-21 (1983) The effect of graded amounts of dietary lactalbumin (L), casein (C), soy (S), wheat (W) protein and Purina rodent chow (stock diet) on the immune responsiveness of C3H/HeN mice has been investigated by measuring the specific humoral immune response to sheep red blood cells (SRBC), and horse red blood cells (HRBC) as well as the nonspecific splenic cell responsiveness to phyto-hemagglutinin (PHA) and concanavalin A (Con A) after stimulation with Myco-bacterium bovis, strain BCG. The nutritional efficiency of these diets was normal and similar. The immune response of mice fed the L diets, was found to be almost five times higher than that of mice fed the corresponding C diets. The humoral immune response of mice fed C, S, and W diets was substantially lower than that of mice fed stock diet, whereas that of mice fed L diet was higher. The above- described immune effect of all tested proteins was obtained at 20 g/100 g concentration with no further increments with 30- and 40 g/100 g protein in the diet. Mitogen responsiveness to PHA and Con A in L diet-fed mice was only slightly higher than that of C diet-fed mice. Little difference in immune responses was noted among mice fed C, S or W protein diets. The principal factor responsible for the observed immune effect does not appear to be the availability or concentration of single essential amino acids but rather the composite effect of the specific amino acid distribution in the protein. 4\\\\. Differential Effect Of Dietary Protein Type On The B-Cell And T-Cell Immune Responses In Mice Bounous G., Kongshavn P.A. J Nutr. Nov;115(11) :1403-8 (1985) The effect of 20 g/100 g diet of lactalbumin (L), casein (C), soy (S) and wheat (W) protein on the immune responsiveness of C3H/HeN mice has been investigated by measuring the humoral immune response to the T cell- independent antigen, TNP-Ficoll. The humoral immune response of mice fed the L diet was found to be higher than that of mice fed the C, S and W diets. On the other hand, delayed-type hypersensitivity, and splenic cell mitogen responses to phytohemagglutinin and concanavalin A did not differ among mice fed the various diets. Similarly, the type of diet did not appear to influence host resistance to Salmonella typhymurium. It is postulated that the type of protein in the diet influences directly the intrinsic capacity of the B lymphocytes to respond to an immunogenic stimulus. 5\\\\. Mechanism Of Altered B-Cell Response Induced By Changes In Dietary Protein Type In Mice Bounous G., Shenouda N., Kongshavn P.A., Osmond D.G. J Nutr. Nov;115(11) :1409-17 (1985) The effect of 20 g/100 g dietary lactalbumin (L) or casein (C) diets or a nonpurified (NP) diet on the immune responsiveness of C57B1/6J, C3H/HeJ and BALB/cJ mice has been investigated by measuring the response to the T cell- independent antigen, TNP-Ficoll. To investigate the possible influence of dietary protein type on the supply of B lymphocytes, bone marrow lymphocyte production has been examined by a radioautographic assay of small lymphocyte renewal and an immuno-fluorescent stathmokinetic assay of pre-B cells and their proliferation. The humoral response of all mice fed the L diet was found to be higher than that of mice fed the C diet or non purified diet. A similar pattern of dietary protein effect in (CBA/N x DBA/2J) F1 mice carrying the xid defect was observed following challenge with sheep red blood cells (SRBC). An even greater enhancing effect of dietary L was noted in normal (DBA/2J x CBA/N) F1 mice after immunization with SRBC, but in contrast, the normal large-scale production of B lymphocytes in mouse bone marrow was independent of the type of dietary protein. Dietary protein type did not affect blood level of minerals and trace metals. The free plasma amino acid profile essentially conformed to the amino acid composition of the ingested protein, suggesting that the changes in plasma amino acid profile might be a crucial factor in diet-dependent enhancement or depression of the B-cell response. The findings indicate that the observed effects of altered dietary protein type on humoral immune responsiveness are not exerted centrally on the rate of primary B-lymphocyte production in the bone marrow, but may reflect changes either in the functional responsiveness of the B lymphocytes themselves or in the processes leading to their activation and differentiation in the peripheral lymphoid tissues. 6\\\\. The Immunoenhancing Property Of Dietary Whey Protein Concentrate Bounous G., Kongshavn P.A., Gold P. Clin Invest Med.Aug;11(4) :271-8 (1988) The plaque-forming cell response to sheep red blood cells was found to be enhanced in mice fed a formula diet containing 20 g lactalbumin /100 g diet in comparison to mice fed equivalent formula diets of similar nutritional efficiency containing 20 g / 100 g diet of either casein, soy, wheat or corn protein, egg albumin, beef or fish protein, Spirulina maxima, or Scenedesmus protein, or Purina mouse chow. This effect was manifest after 2 weeks and persisted for at least 8 weeks of dietary treatment. Mixing lactalbumin with either casein or soy protein in a 20 g protein / 100 g diet formula significantly enhanced the immune response in comparison to that of mice fed diets containing 20% soy protein or casein. 7\\\\. Dietary Whey Protein Inhibits The Development Of Dimethyl-hydrazine Induced Malignancy Bounous G., Papenburg R., Kongshavn P.A., Gold P., Fleiszer D. Clin Invest Med. Jun;11(3) :213-7 (1988) This study investigates the influence of two formula diets containing 20 g/100 g diet of either whey protein concentrate or casein or Purina mouse chow, on the humoral immune responsiveness and dimethylhydrazine induced colon carcinogenesis in A/J mice. After 20 weeks of dimethylhydrazine treatment, the number of plaque forming cells per spleen, following intravenous inoculation with 5 x 106 sheep red blood cells, was nearly three times greater in the whey protein-fed group than in the casein-fed mice although both values were substantially below normal. After 24 weeks of dimethylhydrazine treatment the incidence of tumors in the whey protein-fed mice was substantially lower than that in mice fed either the casein or Purina diet. Similarly, the tumor area was less in the whey protein group in comparison to either the casein or Purina groups, with some difference between casein and Purina groups. Body weight curves were similar in all dietary groups. In conclusion, a whey protein diet appears to significantly inhibit the incidence and growth of chemically induced colon tumors in mice. 8\\\\. The Influence Of Dietary Whey Protein On Tissue Glutathione And The Diseases Of Aging Bounous G., Gervais F., Amer V., Batist G., Gold P. Clin Invest Med. Dec;12(6) :343-9 (1989) This study compared the effects of a whey-rich diet (20 g / 100 g diet), with that of Purina mouse chow or casein-rich diet (20 g / 100 g diet), on the liver and heart glutathione content and on the survival of old male C57BL / 6 NIA mice. The study was performed during a limited observation period of 6.3 months. In mice fed the whey protein-rich diet between 17 months and 20 months of age, the heart tissue and liver tissue glutathione content were enhanced above the corresponding values of the casein diet-fed and Purina-fed mice. Mice fed the whey protein diet at the onset of senescence, exhibited increased longevity as compared to mice fed Purina mouse chow over the 6.3 month observation period extending from the age of 21 months (corresponding to a human age of 55 years) to 26‚Äì27 months of age (corresponding to a human age of 80 years), during which time 55% mortality was observed. The corresponding mean survival time of mice fed the defined casein diet is almost identical to that of Purina-fed controls. Body weight curves were similar in all three dietary groups. Hence, a whey protein diet appears to enhance the liver and heart glutathione concentration in aging mice and to increase longevity over a 6.3 month observation period. 9\\\\. Immunoenhancing Property Of Dietary Whey Protein In Mice: Role Of Glutathione Bounous G., Batist G., Gold P. Clin Invest Med. Jun;12(3) :154-61 (1989) The spleen cells immune response to sheep red blood cells of C3H/HeJ mice fed a 20 g whey protein/100 g diet is substantially higher than that of mice fed an equivalent casein diet of similar nutritional efficiency. The present study indicates that the observed immunoenhancing effect of the whey protein mixture is dependent on the overall amino acid pattern resulting from the contribution of all its protein components. Whey protein contains substantially more cysteine than casein. Dietary cysteine is considered to be a rate limiting substrate for the synthesis of glutathione which is necessary for lymphocyte proliferation. Our studies show that enhancement of host humoral immune response is associated with greater and more sustained production of splenic glutathione during the antigen driven clonal expansion of the lymphocyte in whey protein fed mice in comparison to mice fed the equivalent casein or the cysteine-enriched casein diet. Hence the efficiency of dietary cysteine in inducing supernormal glutathione levels is greater when it is delivered in the whey protein than as free cysteine. Administration of S-(n-butyl) homocysteine sulfoximine, which reduces splenic glutathione level by half, produces a 4-5 fold drop in the humoral immune response of whey protein diet-fed mice. This is further evidence of the important role of glutathione in the immunoenhancing effect of dietary whey protein. 10\\\\. Changes in biliary secretory immunoglobulins A in mice fed whey proteins Costantino A.M., Balzola F., Bounous G. Minerva Dietol Gastroenterol 35(4): 241-5 (1989) A whey protein diet has been shown to enhance splenic immune response to sheep red blood cells (SBRC) in mice. This study was designed to investigate the influence of the type of dietary protein on the biliary secretory IgA. A/J mice were fed defined formula diets containing either 20% whey protein, or 20% casein. Another group was fed Purina mouse chow. After 3 weeks of dietary treatment the body weight of each mouse was recorded and the gall-bladder was removed and its whole content analyzed by ELISA to determine S-IgA secretion. Body weight curves were similar in all dietary groups; higher biliary levels of S-IgA appeared in the whey protein fed mice than in the casein (p less than 0.025) or purine (p less than 0.025) fed mice. Dietary protein type may have a direct influence on the immune response in the gastrointestinal tract, without affecting body weight. 11\\\\. Dietary Milk Proteins Inhibit The Development Of Dimethyl-hydrazine-Induced Malignancy (2) Papenburg R., Bounous G., Fleiszer D., Gold P. Tumour Biol.11(3) :129-36 (1990) This study investigated the influence of two formula diets containing 20 g/100 g diet of either whey protein concentrate or casein, or Purina mouse chow on 1,2dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced colon carcinoma in A/J mice. Four weeks after the 24th DMH treatment the incidence of tumour and tumour area in the whey protein-fed mice was substantially less in comparison to either the casein or Purina groups. The Purina group exhibited the greatest tumour burden. At the end of the experiment all animals continuously fed the whey protein diet were found to be alive, whereas 33% of those on the casein or Purina diet had died. Animals fed Purina diet for 20 weeks and then switched to either milk protein diet for a further 8 weeks exhibited a decrease in tumour burden as compared to those animals fed the Purina diet continuously. Body weights were similar in all dietary groups. In conclusion, a whey protein diet appears to significantly influence the development of chemically induced colon tumours and the short- term survival of mice. 12\\\\. Whey Proteins In Cancer Prevention Bounous G., Batist G., Gold P. Cancer Lett. 1991 May 1;57(2) :91-4. Review. (1991) Epidemiological and experimental studies suggest that dietary milk products may exert an inhibitory effect on the development of several types of tumors. Some recent experiments in rodents indicate that the antitumor activity of the dairy products is in the protein fraction and more specifically in the whey protein component of milk. We and others have demonstrated that whey protein diets result in increased glutathione (GSH) concentration in a number of tissues, and that some of the beneficial effects of whey protein intake are abrogated by inhibition of GSH synthesis. Whey protein is particularly rich in substrates for GSH synthesis. We suggest that whey protein may be exerting its effect on carcinogenesis by enhancing GSH concentration. 13\\\\. The Biological Activity Of Undenatured Dietary Whey Proteins: Role Of Glutathione Bounous G., Gold P. Clin Invest Mod. 1991 Aug;14(4) :296-309 (1991) This study compared the effects of different sources of whey protein concentrate (20 g/100 g diet) and of casein on the spleen, liver, and heart glutathione content of C3H/HeJ mice, and on the immune response of their spleen cells to sheep red blood cells. Body weight curves were similar in all dietary groups. Our data indicate that the humoral immune response is highest in mice fed a dietary whey protein concentrate exhibiting the highest solubility (undenatured conformation) and a greater relative concentration of the thermolabile cystine rich proteins. In addition, the mice fed this type of whey protein concentrate exhibit higher levels of tissue glutathione. The presence in the serum albumin fraction of glutamylcysteine groups (rare in food protein) and the specific intramolecular bond as related to the undenatured conformation of the molecule are considered to be key factors in the glutathione-promoting activity of the protein mixture. 14\\\\. Whey Proteins As A Food Supplement In HIV-Seropositive Individuals Bounous G., Baruchel S., Falutz J., Gold P. Clin Invest Med. Jun;16(3) :204-9 (1993) On the basis of numerous animal experiments, a pilot study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of undenatured, biologically active, dietary whey protein in 3 HIV-seropositive individuals over a period of 3 months. Whey protein concentrate was prepared so that the most thermosensitive proteins, such as serum albumin which contains 6 glutamylcysteine groups, would be in undenatured form. Whey protein powder dissolved in a drink of the patient's choice was drunk cold in quantities that were increased progressively from 8.4 to 39.2 g per day. Patients took whey proteins without adverse side effects. In the 3 patients whose body weight had been stable in the preceding 2 months, weight gain increased progressively between 2 and 7 kg, with 2 of the patients reaching ideal body weight. Serum proteins, including albumin, remained unchanged and within normal range, indicating that protein replenishment per se was not likely the cause of increased body weight. The glutathione content of the blood mononuclear cells was, as expected, below normal values in all patients at the beginning of the study. Over the 3-month period, GSH levels increased and in one case rose by 70% to reach normal value. The increase in body weight observed in these patients did not correlate with increase in energy or protein intake. In conclusion, these preliminary data indicate that, in patients who maintain an adequate total caloric intake, the addition of ‚Äúbioactive‚Äù whey protein concentrate as a significant portion of total protein intake increases body weight and shows elevation of glutathione (GSH) content of mononuclear cells toward normal levels. This pilot study will serve as a basis for a much larger clinical trial. 15\\\\. Anti-HIV and Anti-Apoptotic Activity of the Whey Protein Concentrate: Immunocal Baruchel S, Olivier R, Wainberg M. PRESENTED AT THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AIDS; INT. CONF. AIDS AUG. 7-12, 1994 (Abstract no. 421A). Objectives: The in vivo glutathione (GSH) promoting activity of undenatured Whey protein concentrate (WPC) has already been demonstrated. Here we demonstrate the anti HIV and anti-apoptotic activity of a WPC product termed IMMUNOCAL and its relation with GSH synthesis. Methods: IMMUNOCAL is produced in linear fashion in order to maintain proteins in a non denatured form and to preserve their glutamyl cysteine residues. We tested the in vitro anti-HIV activity on cord blood mononuclear cells and MT 4 cells by studying each of reverse transcriptase (RT) activity, p24 antigen production, and syncytium formation. GSH was measured by spectrophotometric recycling assay. Apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry on PBMC from HIV infected individuals (cells were stained with acridine orange and ethidium bromide) (n = 6). Results: An anti HIV activity was found at WPC concentrations between 100 micrograms/ml and 500 micrograms/ml. Inhibition of syncytium formation occurred with an IC50 of 150 micrograms/ml. PBMCs cultured with these WPC concentrations (N = 3) had a statistically significant increase in GSH synthesis when compared to untreated cells, 9.6 +/- 1.5 vs 5.4 +/- nmoles/10(7) cells, p = 0.01. HIV infected PBMCs cultured in the presence of 100 micrograms/ml of WPC were less prone to die of apoptosis than untreated cells, 15% +/- 2.6 vs 37% +/- 2.4 p <0.001. Conclusion: IMMUNOCAL (WPC) possesses antiviral and anti-apoptotic activities which may be related to its glutathione promoting activity. A clinical trial is currently going on with children with AIDS and wasting syndrome. 16\\\\. Place For An Antioxidant Therapy In Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection Baruchel S., Bounous G., Gold P. Oxidative Stress, Cell Activation and Viral Infection ‚Äì C. Pasquier et al. (eds); 311-321 (1994) Oxidative stress, a known activator of HIV replication in vitro, has a potential role as a cofactor of HIV disease progression. Arguments supporting the role of oxidative stress as a cofactor in HIV activation are summarized in this review. The role of intracellular antioxidants such as glutathione (GSH), and drugs and nutriceutical agents promoting GSH synthesis, are discussed. The review also includes the early results of nutritional interventions based on a diet enriched with IMMUNOCAL, a whey protein concentrate prepared in a proprietary manner. 17\\\\. The Use Of A Whey Protein Concentrate In The Treatment Of Patients With Metastatic Carcinoma : A Phase I-II Clinical Study Kennedy R.S., Konok G.P., Bounous G., Baruchel S., Lee T.D. Anticancer Res. Nov-Dec;15(6B) :2643-9 (1995) Glutathione (GSH) concentration is high in most tumor cells and this may be an important factor in resistance to chemotherapy. Previous in-vitro and animal experiments have shown a differential response of tumor versus normal cells to various cysteine delivery systems. More specifically, an in-vitro assay showed that at concentrations that induce GSH synthesis in normal human cells, a specially prepared whey protein concentrate, Immunocal, caused GSH depletion and inhibition of proliferation in human breast cancer cells. On the basis of this information five patients with metastatic carcinoma of the breast, one of the pancreas and one of the liver were fed 30 grams of this whey protein concentrate daily for six months. In six patients the blood lymphocyte GSH levels were substantially above normal at the outset, reflecting high tumor GSH levels. Two patients (#1, #3) exhibited signs of tumor regression, normalization of haemoglobin and peripheral lymphocyte counts and a sustained drop of lymphocyte GSH levels towards normal. Two patients (#2, #7) showed stabilization of the tumor, increased haemoglobin levels. In three patients (#4, #5, #6) the disease progressed with a trend toward higher lymphocyte GSH levels. These results indicate that whey protein concentrate might deplete tumor cells of GSH and render than more vulnerable to chemotherapy. 18\\\\. In Vitro Selective Modulation of Cellular Glutathione by a Humanized Native Milk Protein Isolate in Normal Cells and Rat Mammary Carcinoma Model Sylvain Baruchel & Ginette Viau ANTICANCER RESEARCH 16:1095-1100 (1996) We report the in vitro selective inhibitory activity of a humanized whey protein concentrate IMMUNOCAL on growth of mammary carcinoma cells and Jurkat T cells in comparison to normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We related this inhibitory activity to a selective depletion of intracellular glutathione synthesis. The use of humanized whey protein concentrate as a food supplementation may have direct implication in clinical trials with adjuvant chemotherapy. Glutathione (GSH) accounts for more than 90% of total intracellular non-protein sulfhydryl and is critical in a variety of cellular defense functions including protection from toxic oxygen species and detoxification of various xenobiotics. Tumor cell GSH concentration may be among the determinant of the cytotoxicity of many chemotherapeutic agents and of radiation, and an increase in GSH concentration appears to be at least one of the mechanisms of acquired drug resistance to chemotherapy. Therapeutic elevation of normal cell GSH levels has also been investigated as a means to reduce the toxicity associated with a wide variety of compounds of both endogenous and exogenous origin. GSH may be increased by different methods including delivery of L-Cystine, a rare limiting amino acid in GSH synthesis. This is difficult since cysteine is toxic, it is not transported efficiently into cells, and is oxidized spontaneously at neutral pH. Attempts to cancer treatment based on modulation of GSH concentration in tumor cells must take into consideration the glutathione status and the rate of GSH synthesis in these cells. It is well known that rapid GSH synthesis in tumor cells is associated with high rates of cellular proliferation. Depletion of tumor GSH in vivo decreases the rate of cellular proliferation and inhibits cancer growth. In practice it is difficult to reduce GSH sufficiently in a tumor in vivo without placing the normal tissue at risk. Numerous studies have demonstrated that GSH can be differently manipulated in normal versus tumor cell line. Dependent upon the method of GSH manipulation protection could be demonstrated in normal but not in tumor cell line. In this report we demonstrate that it is possible to selectively modulate in vivo GSH synthesis in normal cells compared to cancer cells with a humanized Whey Protein Concentrate (HWPC) and that this selective GSH modulation has an impact on cells proliferation. 19\\\\. Treatment Of Chronic Hepatitis Using Whey Protein (Non-Heated) Watanabe A., Higuchi K., Okada K., Shimizu Y., Kondo Y., Kohri H. 16th International Congress of Nutrition (Montreal, Canada) (1997) In an open study, the clinical efficacy of whey protein (Immunocal: cysteine content; 7.6-fold that of casein) isolated from fresh milk and purified without being heated was evaluated based on liver function test, immunological parameters, plasma or lymphocyte GSH concentrations and hepatitis virus markers in 25 patients with chronic hepatitis B or C. Immunocal (12 g as protein) food (mousse) was given twice a day, in the morning and evening, for 12 weeks (test period). Casein (12 g as protein) food (mousse) was given for 2 weeks prior to the start of -supplement with Immunocal food (induction period) and for 4 weeks after the end (follow-up period). The effects of Immunocal food on various clinical parameters were examined at 4-week intervals for 18 weeks to evaluate the efficacy of Immunocal. As a result, serum ALT activity decreased in 6 of 8 patients with chronic hepatitis B 12 weeks after the start of supplement with Immunocal food. Plasma GSH concentrations were increased in 5 of the 8 patients. Serum . concentrations of lipid peroxides significantly decreased 8 weeks after Immunocal food. Serum IL-2 levels began to increase 8 weeks and remained high even after supplement with Immunocal -food had ended. Furthermore, NK activity was significantly increased. However, an item correlating with reduced serum ALT activity could not be clarified. In 17 patients with chronic hepatitis C, there wore no significant Immunocal-related changes in liver function test or immunological parameters. These findings suggest that long-term supplement with Immunocal alone may be effective for patients with chronic hepatitis B, and a further clinical study that long-term combination therapy with Immunocal and other agents including interferon may be effective for those with chronic hepatitis C should be performed. 21\\\\. The Effect Of Supplementation With A Cysteine Donor On Muscular Performance Lands L.C., Grey V.L., Smountas A.A. J Appl Physiol. Oct;87(4) :1381-5 (1999) Oxidative stress contributes to muscular fatigue. GSH is the major intracellular antioxidant, the biosynthesis of which is dependent on cysteine availability. We hypothesized that supplementation with a whey-based cysteine donor [Immunocal] designed to augment intracellular GSH would enhance performance. Twenty healthy young adults (10 men, 10 women) were studied presupplementation and 3 mo postsupplementation with either Immunocal (20 g/day) or casein placebo. Muscular performance was assessed by whole leg isokinetic cycle testing, measuring peak power and 30-s work capacity. Lymphocyte GSH was used as a marker of tissue GSH. There were no baseline differences (age, ht, wt, %ideal wt, peak power, 30-s work capacity). Follow- up data on 18 subjects (9 Immunocal, 9 placebo) were analyzed. Both peak power [13 +/- 3.5 (SE) %, P < 0.02] and 30-s work capacity (13 +/- 3.7%, P < 0.03) increased significantly in the Immunocal group, with no change (2 +/- 9.0 and 1 +/- 9.3%) in the placebo group. Lymphocyte GSH also increased significantly in the Immunocal group (35.5 +/- 11.04%, P < 0.02), with no change in the placebo group (-0.9 +/- 9.6%). This is the first study to demonstrate that prolonged supplementation with a product designed to augment antioxidant defenses resulted in improved volitional performance. 22\\\\. Whey Protein Concentrate (WPC) And Glutathione Modulation In Cancer Treatment Bounous G. Anticancer Research 20 :4785-4792 (2000) The glutathione (GSH) antioxidant system is foremost among the cellular protective mechanisms. Depletion of this small molecule is a common consequence of increased formation of reactive oxygen species during increased cellular activities. This phenomenon can occur in the lymphocytes during the development of the immune response and in the muscular cells during strenuous exercise. It is not surprising that so much research has been done, and is still being done on this small tripeptide molecule. Whey protein concentrate has been shown to represent an effective and safe cysteine donor for GSH replenishment during GSH depletion in immune deficiency states. Cysteine is the crucial limiting amino acid for intracellular GSH synthesis. Animal experiments showed that the concentrates of whey proteins also exhibit anti-carcinogenesis and anticancer activity. They do this via their effect on increasing GSH concentration in relevant tissues, and may have anti-tumor effect on low volume of tumor via stimulation of immunity through the GSH pathway. It is considered that oxygen radical generation is frequently a critical step in carcinogenesis, hence the effect of GSH on free radicals as well as carcinogen detoxification, could be important in inhibiting carcinogenesis induced by a number of different mechanisms. Case reports are presented which strongly suggest an anti-tumor effect of a whey protein dietary supplement in some urogenital cancers. This non toxic dietary intervention, which is not based on the principles of current cancer chemotherapy, will hopefully attract the attention of laboratory and clinical oncologists. 23\\\\. Treatment Of Obstructive Airway Disease With A Cysteine Donor Protein Supplement Report Lothian B., Grey V, Kimoff R.J., Lands L.C. Chest. Mar;117(3) :914-6 (2000) Oxidant/antioxidant imbalance can occur in obstructive airways disease as a result of ongoing inflammation. Glutathione (GSH) plays a major role in pulmonary antioxidant protection. As an alternative or complement to anti-inflammatory therapy, augmenting antioxidant protection could diminish the effects of inflammation. We describe a case of a patient who had obstructive lung disease responsive to corticosteroids, and low whole blood GSH levels. After 1 month of supplementation with a whey-based oral supplement designed to provide GSH precursors, whole blood GSH levels and pulmonary function increased significantly and dramatically. The potential for such supplementation in pulmonary inflammatory conditions deserves further study. 24\\\\. Enhancing Effect Of Patented Whey Protein Isolate (Immunocal) On The Cytotoxicity Of Anti-Cancer Drug. Tsai W.Y., Chang W.H., Chen C.H., Lu F. Nutrition and Cancer, Vol 38, Issue #2 (2000) To determine the enhancing effect of a whey protein isolate on the cytotoxicity of a potential anti-cancer drug. baicalein, human hepatoma cell line HepG2 was assigned to grow in different media for four days, followed by the investigation of cell growth and apoptosis. Excluding the control group with normal medium, other three treatment media included whey protein isolate (marketed as Immunocal) medium, baicalein medium, and combined medium containing both Irnmunocal and baicalein. MTT assay indicated that cells grew in combined medium had a significantly lower survival rate compared to the cells grew in baicalein medium; in contrast, for the cells grew in Immunocal group, there was no significant difference on survival rate. In the investigation of apoptosis. compared to the cells in baicalein medium, cells in combined medium showed a higher phosphatidylserine exposure, lower rnitochondrial transmembrane potential and nearly 13 times more cells were detected undergoing apoptosis. We also demonstrated that Immunocal was able to reduce glutathione in HepG2 by 20% to 40% and regulated the elevation of glutathione, which was in response to baicalein. In conclusion, Immunocal seemed to enhance the cytotoxicity of baicalein by inducing more apoptosis, this increase in apoptotic cells may be in association with the depletion of GSH in HepG2. This is the first study to demonstrate, in vitro, that Immunocal may function as an adjuvant in cancer treatments. 25\\\\. Nutriceutical Modulation Of Glutathione With A Humanized Native Milk Serum Protein Isolate, Immunocal: Application In AIDS And Cancer Baruchel S., Viau G., Olivier R., Bounous G., Wainberg MA Marcel Dekker Inc. The biological activity of the proteins isolated from cow's milk in Immunocal depends on the preservation of those labile proteins which share with the predominant human milk proteins the same extremely rare glutathione (GSH)-promoting components. Cellular GSH depletion has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of degenerative conditions and disease states including Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, arteriosclerosis, cataracts, cystic fibrosis, malnutrition, aging, AIDS, and cancer. This newly discovered nutriceutical modulation of GSH by the use of humanized native milk serum protein isolate of bovine origin in AIDS and cancer may well find other applications in disease where oxidative stress and pathology of GSH metabolism are largely implicated. In a pilot study, this type of whey protein concentrate was found to be well tolerated in children with AIDS and wasting syndrome and was found associated with an improvement of the nutritional status of the patient. Moreover, the GSH promoting activity on the peripheral blood lymphocyte of this protein concentrate was validated in patients with initial low GSH levels. Extensive pharmaco-epidemiological study of GSH metabolism and standardized methods of measurement of intracellular GSH applicable in clinical trials are needed in order to better define the clinical application of this new type of therapy. 26\\\\. The Antioxidant System Bounous G., Molson J. Anticancer Research 23: 1411-1416 (2003) The glutathione (GSH) antioxidant system is the principal protective mechanism of the cell and is a crucial factor in the development of the immune response by the immune cells. Experimental data demonstrate that a cysteine-rich whey protein concentrate represents an effective cysteine delivery system for GSH replenishment during the immune response. Animal experiments showed that the concentrates of whey protein also exhibit anticancer activity. They do this via the GSH pathway, the induction of p53 protein in transformed cells and inhibition of neoangiogenesis. 27\\\\. Milk Whey Protein decreases Oxygen Free Radical Production in a Murine Model of Chronic Iron-Overload Cardiomyopathy Bartfay WJ, Davis MT, Medves JM, Lugowski S Can J. Cardiol Vol 19 No 10, Sept. 03: 1163-1168 (2003) Background: Chronic iron overload is a major cause of organ failure worldwide, but its pathogenesis remains to be elucidated. Objectives: To examine in an experimental murine model of iron-overload cardiomyopathy the relation between milk whey protein and, first, the production of reactive oxygen free radical species and, second, antioxidant reserve status. METHODS: B6D2F1 mice were randomly assigned to four treatment groups (n=8 per treatment group): placebo control; iron only; whey only; and iron with whey. Reactive oxygen free radical species in the heart were quantified by the cytotoxic aldehydes malondialdehyde (MDA), 4-hydroxy-nonenal (HNE) and hexanal, while antioxidant reserve status was quantified by glutathione (GSH) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity in the heart tissue. Results: Significantly decreased concentrations (pmol/100 mg wet weight tissue) of MDA (2468+/-261), HNE (912+/-38) and hexanal (5385+/-927) were observed in the heart tissue of the group receiving iron with whey, in comparison with the iron-only treatment group (MDA 9307+/-387, HNE 1416+/-157, hexanal 14,874+/-2955; P<0.001). Significantly increased GPx (141+/-38 IU/L) and GSH (521+/-136 IU/L) activity were observed in mice receiving iron with whey, in comparison with mice receiving iron only (GPx 100+/-10 IU/L, GSH 446+/-33 IU/L; P<0.001). Conclusion: Mice receiving iron treatments with whey supplementation had significantly lower concentrations of cytotoxic aldehydes and significantly higher cardiac levels of GPx and GSH activity than did iron- only treated mice. Additional basic research is warranted to examine the exact mechanisms by which milk whey protein protects the heart. 28\\\\. Improved Glutathione Status in Young Adult Patients with Cystic Fibrosis Supplemented with Whey Protein Grey V, Mohammed SR, Smoutas AA, Bahlool R, Lands LC. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis, Vol. 2, Issue 4, Dec. 2003 Background: The lung disease of cystic fibrosis is associated with a chronic inflammatory reaction and an over abundance of oxidants relative to antioxidants. Glutathione functions as a major frontline defense against the build-up of oxidants in the lung. This increased demand for glutathione (GSH) in cystic fibrosis may be limiting if nutritional status is compromised. We sought to increase glutathione levels in stable patients with cystic fibrosis by supplementation with a whey-based protein. Methods: Twenty-one patients who were in stable condition were randomly assigned to take a whey protein isolate (Immunocal, 10 g twice a day) or casein placebo for 3 months. Peripheral lymphocyte GSH was used as a marker of lung GSH. Values were compared with nutritional status and lung parameters. Results: At baseline there were no significant differences in age, height, weight, percent ideal body weight or percent body fat. Lymphocyte GSH was similar in the two groups. After supplementation, we observed a 46.6% increase from baseline (P < 0.05) in the lymphocyte GSH levels in the supplemented group. No other changes were observed. Conclusion: The results show that dietary supplementation with a whey-based product can increase glutathione levels in cystic fibrosis. This nutritional approach may be useful in maintaining optimal levels of GSH and counteract the deleterious effects of oxidative stress in the lung in cystic fibrosis. 29\\\\. Molecular Pathogenesis and Prevention of Prostate Cancer Bounous G., Beer D. Anticancer Research 24: 553-554 (2004) Studies in laboratory animals indicate inhibition of chemically-induced carcinoma by cystine-rich diets enhancing the cysteine-GSH antioxidant system. The progression of carcinoma of the prostate is also inhibited by these diets, which were later found to raise the level of GSH in the prostate epithelium of man. New data presented at the July 13, 2003 meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research indicates that higher levels of total cysteine in plasma may predict a reduced risk for breast cancer. This prospective investigation was conducted among 32,000 women in the Nurses Health study. The previously reported prostate cancer data appears then not to be strictly gender-related as the antioxidant role of the cysteine‚Äì GSH system may also apply to breast cancer prevention. 30\\\\. Effects of Cysteine Donor Supplement on Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction Baumann JM, Runell KW, Evlans TM, Levine AM. Med.Sci.Sports Exerc., Vol. 37, No. 9, pp1468‚Äì1473. 2005. Purpose: Reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) in resident airway cells may be important in bronchoconstriction following exercise. Glutathione (GSH) is a major lung antioxidant and could influence pathological outcomes in individuals with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). This study examined the effects of supplementation with undenatured whey protein (UWP) in subjects exhibiting airway narrowing following eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation (EVH), a surrogate challenge for diagnosis of EIB. UWP is a cysteine donor that augments GSH production. Methods: In a randomized, double- blind, placebo-controlled study, 18 EIB-positive subjects (age: 25.2 +/- 9.01 yr; weight: 77.3 +/- 18.92 kg; height: 1.7 +/- 0.09 m) with post-EVH falls of > or =10% in FEV1 received 30 g UWP (TX) or casein placebo (PL)/d. Subjects performed 6‚Äëmin EVH challenges before and after 4 and 8 wk of supplementation. Exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) was measured serially before spirometry and at 1-wk intervals. Spirometry was performed pre- and 5, 10, and 15 min postchallenge. Results: Subjects exhibited significant mean improvement in postchallenge falls in FEV(1) from 0 wk (-22.6 +/- 12.22%) with TX at 4 (-18.9 +/- 12.89%, P < 0.05) and 8 wk (-16.98 +/- 11.61%, P < 0.05) and significant mean reduction in post-EVH peak falls in FEF(25-75) from 0 wk (-40.6 +/- 15.28%) with TX at 4 (-33.1 +/- 17.11%, P < 0.01) and 8 (-29.7 +/- 17.42%, P < 0.05) wk. No changes in FEV(1) or FEF(25-75) were observed in the PL group at any time point. Mean eNO for PL and TX groups at 0, 4, and 8 wk (46.8 +/- 31.33, 46.5 +/- 35.73, 49.3 +/- 37.12 vs 35.2 +/- 26.87, 29.1 +/- 17.26, 34.7 +/- 21.11 ppb, respectively) was not significantly different. Conclusions: UWP may augment pulmonary antioxidant capacity and be therapeutically beneficial in individuals exhibiting EIB, as postchallenge pulmonary function improved with supplementation. The lack of significant change in eNO suggests that the pulmonary function improvements from UWP supplementation are independent of eNO. 31\\\\. Oxidative stress and ageing: is ageing a cysteine deficiency syndrome? Dr√∂ge, Wulf. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B. Vol. 360, pp 2355‚Äì2372. 2005. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are constantly produced in biological tissues and play a role in various signaling pathways. Abnormally high ROS concentrations cause oxidative stress associated with tissue damage and dysregulation of physiological signals. There is growing evidence that oxidative stress increases with age. It has also been shown that the life span of worms, flies and mice can be significantly increased by mutations, which impede the insulin receptor signaling cascade. Molecular studies revealed that the insulin-independent basal activity of the insulin receptor is increased by ROS and downregulated by certain antioxidants. Complementary clinical studies confirmed that supplementation of the glutathione precursor cysteine decreases insulin responsiveness in the fasted state. In several clinical trials, cysteine supplementation improved skeletal muscle functions, decreased the body fat/lean body mass ratio, decreased plasma levels of the inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor a (TNF-a), improved immune functions, and increased plasma albumin levels. As all these parameters degenerated with age, these findings suggest: (i) that loss of youth, health and quality of life may be partly explained by a deficit in cysteine and (ii) that the dietary consumption of cysteine is generally suboptimal and everybody is likely to have a cysteine deficiency sooner or later. 32\\\\. Cysteine-Rich Protein Reverses Weight Loss in Lung Cancer Patients Receiving Chemotherapy or Radiotherapy Tozer R., Tai P., Falconer W., Ducruet T., Karabadjian A., Bounous G., Molson JH., Dr√∂ge W. Antioxidants & Redox Signaling. Vol. 10, No. 2, 395-402, 2008. Oxidative stress plays a role in the tumor-cytotoxic effect of cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy and also in certain adverse events. In view of these conflicting aspects, a double-blind trial over 6 months has been performed to determine whether a cysteine-rich protein (IMN1207) may have a positive or negative effect on the clinical outcome if compared with casein, a widely used protein supplement low in cysteine. Sixty-six patients with Stage IIIB-IV non-small cell lung cancer were randomly assigned to IMN1207 or casein. Included were patients with a previous involuntary weight loss of ‚â•3%, Karnofsky status ‚â•70, and an estimated survival of > 3 months. Thirty-five lung cancer patients remained on study at six weeks. Overall compliance was not different between treatment arms (42-44% or 13g/day). The patients treated with the cysteine-rich protein had a mean increase of 2.5% body weight while casein-treated patients lost 2.6% (P=0.049). Differences in secondary end points included an increase in survival, hand grip force and quality of life. Adverse events were mild or moderate. Further studies will have to show whether the positive clinical effects can be confirmed and related to specific parameters of oxidative stress in the host. 33\\\\. Oral Tolerability of Cysteine-Rich Whey Protein Isolate in Autism. A Pilot Study Kern JK, Grannemann BD, Trivedi MH. JANA Vol. 11, No. 1, 2008 Purpose: To examine the tolerability of non-denatured whey protein isolate (NWPI) in children with autism. Many children with autism are low in glutathione and have higher levels of oxidative stress. NWPI can raise glutathione levels and reduce oxidative stress. However, anecdotal reports suggest that NWPI may be problematic in children with autism because it contains cysteine and other sulfurated amino acids. Methods: A 6-week open-label trial was conducted, supplementing 10 children with autism or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), 3‚Äì15 years of age, with NWPI (Immunocal). To measure possible side effects, procedures that examined the frequency, intensity, and types of side effects, as well as behavioral measures, were completed at baseline, and at days 3, 14, 30 and 45. Results: Seven of the ten children took the supplement over the six-week trial and tolerated it well. Two children discontinued after two weeks due to possible side effects: one due to gastrointestinal disturbance and one due to being less responsive to parents. Another child discontinued due to difficulty of administering the product. Conclusions: This study suggests that NWPI can be used as a supplement for this small population of children with autism without high rates of side effects, which means that further studies to determine its safety and efficacy in larger populations might yield the same promising result. Larger studies are planned to determine its efficacy in raising glutathione levels. 34\\\\. Children's Oncology Group (COG) Nutrition Committee Paul C. Rogers, MB ChB, MBA, Steven J. Melnick, MD, PhD, Elena J. Ladas, MS, Jacqueline Hamilton, MD, Jacques Baillargeon, PhD, and Nancy Sacks, MS PEDIATR BLOOD CANCER, 50:447-450 (2008) Children's Oncology Group (COG) Nutrition Committee was established to further the knowledge of nutrition in children with cancer by education and conduct of clinical trials. A survey of COG institutions revealed lack of conformity in evaluation and categorization of nutritional status, and criteria for nutritional intervention. The Committee subsequently established specific categories of malnutrition (Underweight and Overweight) based on ideal body weight or body mass index. An algorithm was developed as a guideline for nutritional intervention as well as references and resources for determining estimated needs. The Committee embarked on concepts for clinical trials of nutritional interventions. The first pilot study, evaluating the feasibility of using an immunoneutraceutical precursor for glutathione production, has been completed. The study showed weight gain and improvement in glutathione status. A pilot trial of proactive enteral feeding for patients at high risk of malnutrition has commenced. The Committee believes that nutrition is relevant to all aspects of cancer control. The paucity of nutritional investigation in children with cancer needs to be rectified. 35\\\\. Bringing evidence to complementary and alternative medicine in children with cancer: focus on nutrition-related therapies Kelly Kara M., MD Pediatr Blood Cancer 2008;50:490-493 Children with cancer frequently use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), especially in conjunction with conventional therapy. Dietary supplements are a commonly used CAM modality, with the prevalence of supplement use ranging from 35% to 50% of children with cancer in surveys completed in the United States. Less is known about the use of dietary supplements in developing countries. The evidence for some dietary supplements providing some benefit to children with cancer is reviewed. Preliminary studies have shown that antioxidant status may affect chemotherapy tolerance in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Other supplements, including TRAUMEEL S¬Æ, glutamine, vitamin E, Immunocal¬Æ, colostrum, and probiotics, may help to reduce gastrointestinal toxicities of chemotherapy and radiation. However, more definitive evidence is needed. Most dietary supplements have not been tested adequately to determine their safety and efficacy, with even less understood about their potential interactions with conventional chemotherapy and radiation. With the greater use of dietary supplements by patients with cancer, increasing scientific attention is being paid to the investigation of these therapies. But research on dietary supplements is complex and usually more difficult than that on conventional medications. Strong research designs are critical in obtaining information that will ultimately influence clinical practice and public awareness. 36\\\\. Open-Labeled Pilot Study of Cysteine-Rich Whey Protein Isolate Supplementation for Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Patients Taned Chitapanarux, Prasong Tienboon, Suwalee Pojchamarnwiputh and Donrawee Leelarungrayub JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY & HEPATOLOGY 24:1045-1050 (2009) Background and Aims: Glutathione (GSH) depletion contributes to liver injury and development of steatohepatitis. Undenatured cysteine-rich whey protein isolate has been clinically proven to raise GSH in several patient groups. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of oral supplementation with whey protein on patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Methods: In an open-labeled clinical trial, 38 patients (18 male, 20 female; mean age 48 ¬± 14 years) with NASH confirmed by computed tomography measurements and liver biochemistries were given with a daily dose of 20g whey protein isolate for 12 weeks. Results: A significant reduction in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (64 ¬± 72 vs 46 ¬± 36, P=0.016) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (45 ¬± 49 vs 33 ¬± 18, P=0.047) were observed. Plasma glutathione and total antioxidant capacity increased significantly at the end of study (53 ¬± 11 vs 68 ¬± 11, P< 0.05 and 1.26 ¬± 0.10 vs 2.03 ¬± 0.10, P< 0.05). Liver attenuation index improved from -13.4 ¬± 11.1 to -9.7 ¬± 13.1 (P = 0.048). Hepatic macrovesicular steatosis decreased significantly after 12 weeks of supplementation (33.82 ¬± 12.82 vs 30.66 ¬± 15.96, P=0.046). Whey protein isolate was well tolerated. No serious adverse events were observed. Conclusions: The results indicate that oral supplementation of cysteine-rich whey protein isolate leads to improvements in liver biochemistries, increased plasma GSH, total antioxidant capacity and reduced hepatic macrovesicular steatosis in NASH patients. The results support the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of this disease. 37\\\\. Whey Protein Concentrate Promotes the Production of Glutathione (GSH) by GSH Reductase in the PC12 Cell Line After Acute Ethanol Exposure. Tseng YM, Lin SK, Hsiao JK, Chen IJ, Lee JH, Wu SH, Tsai LY. Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Kaohsiung 81346, Taiwan; Institute of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 80702, Taiwan. Excessive ethanol consumption may increase the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which results in the damage of tissues, especially the neurons and glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of whey protein concentrate (WPC) on the glutathione (GSH) status after acute ethanol exposure in the pheochromocytoma (PC12) cell line. In this study, we assayed the cell viability, the percentage of lactate dehydrogenase released (% LDH released), the level of GSH, and the activity of GSH reductase (GRx). The results showed that with the supplement of WPC, the cell viability displayed no significant difference after acute exposure of ethanol in groups with or without ethanol treatment. The ethanol- induced cytotoxicity showed a slight decrease, and the level of GSH showed a significant increase. The activity of GRx significantly increased when 0.1, 10 mg/ml of WPC was supplied. In conclusion, these results suggest that WPC in a moderate concentration should be a precursor agent to promote the production of GSH and will enhance the antioxidant capacity in the PC12 cell line. 38\\\\. Effects of Alcohol-Induced Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell (PBMC) Pretreated Whey Protein Concentrate (WPC) on Oxidative Damage. Tseng YM, Chen SY, Chen CH, Jin YR, Tsai SM, Chen IJ, Lee JH, Chiu CC, Tsai LY. Institute of Medicine, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Excessive alcohol consumption can induce apoptosis in a variety of tissues and influence the antioxidant status in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). This paper investigates the effects of whey protein concentrate (WPC) pretreated in PBMC on the apoptosis and antioxidant status after the treatment of alcohol. The results show that the percentages of apoptotic cells in the alcohol-treated group were higher than those in the group without alcohol treatment. Additionally, there was higher glutathione (GSH) peroxidase (GPx) activity when the PBMC were treated with 300 mg/dL of alcohol. With regards to the activity of GSH reductase (GRx), there was higher activity in the group pretreated with WPC than in the group with the treatment of alcohol only. On the contrary, the levels of GSH were reduced after the treatment of alcohol, but there was a higher level of GSH in the group pretreated with WPC. In this study, it was found that the increased level of GSH in PBMC might not be attributed to the effect of GRx because there was still a higher level of GSH in the group with the treatment of WPC and BCNU (a GRx inhibitor) in this study. The results indicated that PBMC pretreated with WPC might ameliorate alcohol-induced effects such as imbalance of the antioxidant status. 39\\\\. Effects of Whey Protein Concentrate (WPC) on the Distributions of Lymphocyte Subpopulations in Rats with Excessive Alcohol Intake. Tseng YM, Tsai SM, Lin WS, Huang ZR, Lin CC, Yeh WH, Wu YR, Tsai LY. Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Number 386, Ta-chung 1st road, Kaohsiung 81346 Taiwan. To investigate the effects of whey protein concentrate (WPC) on antioxidant statuses and the lymphocyte subpopulations in the rats with alcohol intake, the antioxidant statuses in the peripheral blood (PB) and the lymphocyte subpopulations in the PB, spleen, and bone marrow (BM) of the rats fed with WPC (0.334 g/kg) and alcohol (6 g/kg) for 3 months were analyzed. Results showed that the effects of WPC on the glutathione peroxidase and glutathione in the PB, the T and B cells in the spleen, and the B cells in the BM were more apparent in the rats with alcohol intake; however, they are not apparent in the controls. Taken together, our results indicated that the immunity of rats might be enhanced by the increased antioxidant ability after WPC supplementation and the effects of WPC on the lymphocyte subpopulations were mainly in the spleen and BM and not in the PB. 40\\\\. Immunocal and preservation of glutathione as a novel neuroprotective strategy for degenerative disorders of the nervous system. Ross EK, Gray JJ, Winter AN, Linseman DA.Department of Biological Sciences, University of Denver, 2199 S. University Blvd., Denver, CO 80208, USA. Recent Pat CNS Drug Discov. 2012 Dec;7(3):230-5. Oxidative stress and glutathione (GSH) depletion are both recognized as significant contributors to the pathogenesis of many devastating neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, mitochondrial dysfunction leads to the aberrant production and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are capable of oxidizing key cellular proteins, lipids, and DNA, ultimately triggering cell death. In addition to other roles that it plays in the cell, GSH functions as a critical scavenger of these ROS. Therefore, GSH depletion exacerbates cell damage due to free radical generation. Strategies that increase or preserve the levels of intracellular GSH have been shown to act in a neuroprotective manner, suggesting that augmentation of the available GSH pool may be a promising therapeutic target for neurodegeneration. This review discusses the capacity of a cystine-rich, whey protein supplement (Immunocal¬Æ) to enhance the de novo synthesis of GSH in neurons, and highlights its potential as a novel therapeutic approach to mitigate the oxidative damage that underlies the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, this review discusses various patents from 1993 to 2012 both with Immunocal¬Æ and other methods that modulate GSH in neurodegeneration. 41\\\\. Psoriasis improvement in patients using glutathione- enhancing, nondenatured whey protein isolate. A pilot study. Prussick R., Prussick L., Gutman J. J CLIN AESTHET DETERMATOL, 2013;6(10):23-26). Background: Psoriasis is a common autoimmune disease with enhanced systemic inflammation and heightened levels of oxidative stress. Glutathione is the major antioxidant in human cells. Objectives: To determine if a nondenatured bioactive whey protein isolate previously demonstrated to increase glutathione levels can clinically improve patients with psoriasis vulgaris. Methods: A single site prospective, non-blinded trial. Seven patients with psoriasis were recruited to take a nondenatured bioactive whey protein isolate, 20g orally per day, in addition to their current treatments, if any. Psoriasis Area and Severity Index scores and photographs were taken at baseline and monthly for three months. Results: Patients with psoriasis were found to have a beneficial clinical improvement, whether they were on existing topical therapy, narrowband ultraviolet B, or no other treatment. Conclusion: The positive preliminary outcomes from this pilot study suggest a randomized, double-blind, clinical trial would be worthwhile in evaluating whether this protein isolate would result in statistically significant improvement for patients with psoriasis. 42\\\\. Prehabilitation versus Rehabilitation: A Randomized Control Trial in Patients Undergoing Colorectal Resection for Cancer. Gillis C, Li C, Lee L, et al. Anesthesiology. 2014 Jul 29: 1-12. Background: The preoperative period (prehabilitation) may represent a more appropriate time than the postoperative period to implement an intervention. The impact of prehabilitation on recovery of functional exercise capacity was thus studied in patients undergoing colorectal resection for cancer. Methods: A parallel- arm single-blind superiority randomized controlled trial was conducted. Seventy-seven patients were randomized to receive either prehabilitation (n = 38) or rehabilitation (n = 39). Both groups received a home-based intervention of moderate aerobic and resistance exercises, nutritional counseling with protein supplementation, and relaxation exercises initiated either 4 weeks before surgery (prehabilitation) or immediately after surgery (rehabilitation), and continued for 8 weeks after surgery. Patients were managed with an enhanced recovery pathway. Primary outcome was functional exercise capacity measured using the validated 6-min walk test. Results: Median duration of prehabilitation was 24.5 days. While awaiting surgery, functional walking capacity increased (20 m) in a higher proportion of the prehabilitation group compared with the rehabilitation group (53 vs. 15%, adjusted P = 0.006). Complication rates and duration of hospital stay were similar. The difference between baseline and 8-week 6-min walking test was significantly higher in the prehabilitation compared with the rehabilitation group (+23.7 m [SD, 54.8] vs. -21.8 m [SD, 80.7]; mean difference 45.4 m [95% CI, 13.9 to 77.0]). A higher proportion of the prehabilitation group were also recovered to or above baseline exercise capacity at 8 weeks compared with the rehabilitation group (84 vs. 62%, adjusted P = 0.049). Conclusion: Meaningful changes in postoperative functional exercise capacity can be achieved with a prehabilitation program. 43\\\\. Effect of cysteine-rich whey protein (Immunocal¬Æ) supplementation in combination with resistance training on muscle strength and lean body mass in non-frail elderly subjects: a randomized, double-blind controlled study Karelis AD, Messier V, Supp√®re C et al. J Nutr Health Aging. 2015 May;19(5):531-6. This double-blind randomized controlled study recruited 99 sedentary non-frail elderly subjects aged between 65 and 88 years old, of which 76 were female and 23 male. Participants were randomly assigned into two groups. The experimental group consumed daily (20g) of a cysteine-rich whey protein isolate (Immunocal¬Æ) compared to daily (20g) casein-the control protein - over a period of 135 days (4.5 months). In addition, all subjects performed the same resistance training program 3 times per week over the 135-day period. Eighty-four (84) subjects completed the 135-day study period. Of these, 67 subjects (34 in the Immunocal¬Æ group and 33 in the control group) complied and used at least 80% of the study product and completed at least 80% of their training sessions. The key findings of the study showed increases in muscle strength in both groups after resistance training, however, significant additional increases were observed in muscle strength with addition of a cysteine rich whey protein (Immunocal¬Æ) versus casein by approximately 10% when expressed in kg per kg body weight (BW) and in kg per kg lean body mass (LBM) (p <0.05), hence the potential impact to perform daily tasks. Whey protein (lactalbumin) is widely used by bodybuilders and other athletes due to current view by nutrition professionals and the American College of Sport Medicine that the protein needs of athletes may me higher than those of non-athletes Based on available research, the American College of Sports Medicine, the American Dietetic Association, and the Dietitians of Canada, in their recent joint position stand on nutrition and athletic performance [1], concluded that protein requirements are higher in very active individuals and suggested that resistance athletes need 1.6‚Äì1.7 g protein/kg body weight while endurance athletes need approximately 1.2‚Äì1.4 g protein/kg, values that are about 150‚Äì200 percent of the current United States Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA).

Ramdhanie was born on Halloween night in Trinidad but now lives in Dublin. She describes herself as a psychic-psychologist . She has stated that psychic abilities are an innate part of the human consciousness and that they are not supernatural powers. She has stated that her goal is to help people to develop their own psychic powers. Ramdhanie also believes that people in successful positions are already using psychic abilities and that their success can be attributed to them. Ramdhanie rejects the term psychic as she said it is misappropriated by frauds. In 2004 Ramdhanie made pleas on national television for the return of her parrot who had been seen on television dancing to rap songs. Abilities Ramdhanie claimed that she first discovered her abilities after entering a haunted house in Trinidad on a night out drinking. She recounted that she saw her first spirit soon after entering the house. However, she also recalled having extraordinary abilities at the age of two. She claimed that she was able to answer complicated medical questions posed to her by students of the Royal College of Surgeons at that young age. Ramdhanie claimed that her psychic abilities helped her to complete college as she knew what every answer to the test was going to be. Ramdhanie attributed the strength of her supposed powers to the fact that she had Indian and Irish parents. She claimed these two people are the most spiritual of all humans. Career Ramdhanie began her public career on the Gerry Ryan show on RT√â radio and was later given a morning slot on East Coast Radio, now East Coast FM. On her show she interpreted people's dreams and purported to heal them over the air. On her radio show, Ramdhanie predicted that US President John F. Kennedy would reincarnate as an Irish writer 35 years after his assassination. Ramdhanie also assisted the FBI in finding the body of a missing teenager. Ramdhanie gained press coverage for her exorcism of the Fahey family house in Newcastle, Co Galway, although she claims that the most haunted county in Ireland is Wicklow. In 1997 Ramdhanie claimed a ¬£50,000 reward for exorcising the Dromquinna Manor Hotel outside Kenmare County Kerry.

It is located on Orzysz Lake in the region of Masuria. History Sacred Heart Church The location of the town has been inhabited for a long time. In 1895 remains of a settlement dated to 300-1000 AD were discovered near the town on the shores of Lake Arys. The present settlement was founded during by the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order Konrad von Erlichshausen in 1443. After the Peace of Toru≈Ñ in 1466 it came under Polish suzerainty as a fief. After Reformation until 1702 church services in the only church were conducted in the Masurian dialect of Polish, spoken by the culturally Germanized but ethnically Polish (Masurian) majority population of the town. A year earlier, in 1701, the town became part of the Kingdom of Prussia. The population of Arys in 1740 was 640, and in 1782 about 900. The population of Arys slowly increased. There were 85 craftsmen recorded in 1775, a majority of them shoemakers. The town, located on a trading route, was granted city rights in 1725 by Frederick William I of Prussia. The town has been militarily occupied frequently. During the Seven Years' War it was held by Russian troops for four years. The troops were quartered in the town also in the years 1806-1807, and 1812-1813. A fire destroyed almost the entire town in 1826. In 1834 Masurians constituted a slight majority of residents ‚Äì 600 compared to 502 Germans.Jan Ba≈Çdowski, Warmia i Mazury, ma≈Çy przewodnik, Wydawnictwo Sport i Turystyka, Warsaw, 1977, p. 164-165 =20th century= During World War I, several battles were fought between the German and Russian armies in 1914 and 1915 in the area of Arys. The town was held by Russian troops for 20 days and heavily damaged. [Source from the Cold War period] On July 11, 1920, the East Prussian plebiscite, mandated by the Versailles Treaty, was held in the District of Allenstein (now Olzstyn), which included Arys. District-wide results were 1,480 votes for Germany and only 1 (one) vote for Poland. Towards the end of World War II Arys was nearly destroyed in the Soviet January offensive. There were only 300 people remaining in the town in January 1945, mostly Masurians. Arys was acquired by Poland under the border changes promulgated at the Potsdam Conference in July-August 1945, the remaining German residents of the town, now officially Orzysz, were expelled, and were replaced by Polish settlers.

Entered Service at: Tacoma, Wash. Born: May 11, 1917, St. Maries, Idaho. G.O. No.: 77, September 10, 1945. Citation: :He was a scout with the regiment which seized the fortress of Corregidor, Philippine Islands. Shortly after the initial parachute assault on 16 February 1945, he crossed 30 yards of open ground under intense enemy fire, and at pointblank range silenced a machinegun with hand grenades. On the afternoon of 18 February he killed 6 snipers. That evening, when a large force attempted to bypass his company, he voluntarily moved to an exposed area and opened fire. The enemy attacked his position repeatedly throughout the night and was each time repulsed. By 2 o'clock in the morning, all the men about him had been wounded; but shouting encouragement to his comrades and defiance at the enemy, he continued to bear the brunt of the attack, fearlessly exposing himself to locate enemy soldiers and then pouring heavy fire on them. He repeatedly crawled back to the American line to secure more ammunition. When his submachine gun would no longer operate, he seized an automatic rifle and continued to inflict heavy casualties. This weapon, in turn, became too hot to use and, discarding it, he continued with an M-1 rifle. At dawn the enemy attacked with renewed intensity. Completely exposing himself to hostile fire, he stood erect to locate the most dangerous enemy positions. He was seriously wounded; but, though he had already killed more than 30 of the enemy, he refused to evacuate until he had pointed out immediate objectives for attack. Through his sustained and outstanding heroism in the face of grave and obvious danger, Pvt. McCarter made outstanding contributions to the success of his company and to the recapture of Corregidor.\\"  Later life  McCarter was discharged from military service in 1945 due to wounds received in the action on Corregidor.

Brower was buried in the North Star Cemetery in Saint Cloud, Minnesota. His monument recognizes him as the founder of Itasca State Park and the Minnesota State Park system. Lake Itasca In 1888 acting as surveyor he visited Lake Itasca to settle a dispute over the source of the Mississippi River. The issue was whether Nicollet Creek at the southern tip of the Lake Itasca and flows into the lake was the official start of the Mississippi. Brower followed the stream through swamps, ponds to Lake Hernando de Soto. Brower spent five months on Lake Itasca and eventually suggested that since he believed that the Nicollet Creek was an intermittent stream that it should not qualify as the source.Ohio River By John Ed Pearce, p44 1989 - Brower was to lead a campaign to stop logging around Lake Itasca by companies owned by Friedrich Weyerh√§user.

Hawthorne's themes, the nature of sin, social hypocrisy, and community repression, still reverberate through American society. Hester Prynne (Meg Foster) is a young, Puritan woman who commits adultery while her husband is in Europe, and, upon the birth of her illegitimate child, is subsequently condemned to wear a scarlet \\"A\\" for the rest of her life. Her secret partner, the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, (John Heard) writhes in private torment as he deals with hiding his sin. The person of Hester's husband, Roger Chillingworth (Kevin Conway) completes this grim triangle as the mysterious situation leads to a shattering climax. The story follows the main characters as they grapple with sin, forgiveness, and redemption.

He married twice. In 1820, while in law school, he married Sarah Bolling Tazewell of Williamsburg, Virginia. She died July 9, 1825, aged 22, after her second childbirth, although that son, Tazewell Goode, would die as an infant, as had his brother William O. Goode Jr. In 1829 William Goode married Sarah Maria Massie (d. 1844), who bore several children who lived to adulthood, but also died shortly after childbirth and her daughter Sarah Massie Goode died as a child. Two of her sons married, Lucy Herbert Waller Goode Baskerville (1833-1863) and Henrietta Waller Goode Boyd (1842-1876). Three of their sons became Confederate States Army officers after their father's death and Virginia's secession, of whom William Osborne Goode Jr. (1830-1865) died in battle. John Thomas Goode (1835-1916), who had attended the Virginia Military Institute but resigned before graduation to accept a lieutenant's commission in the U.S. Army, would relinquish it and rise to the rank of Major in the Confederate States Army. They son Edward Branch Goode (1839-1920) would also become a Confederate officer (in the 34th Virginia Infantry) and survive the war. J. Thomas Goode would marry four times, and his son, Morton G. Goode would follow the family's traditional careers in law and politics to become president pro tem of the Virginia senate. Early career Admitted to the Virginia bar in 1821, William Goode set up a legal practice in Boydton, Virginia. Political career Goode represented Mecklenburg County in the Virginia House of Delegates from 1822 to 1823. He was re-elected in 1824 and afterward, expecting to serve through the term ending 1833. He gave up his seat to make an unsuccessful 1832 run for the United States House of Representatives. During that time, he also was a member of the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1829. Goode was re-elected to the House of Delegates (1839‚Äì41). He was elected as a Democrat to the United States House of Representatives in 1840, serving from 1841 to 1843. He was elected again to the Virginia House from 1845 to 1847, and was elected as Speaker. He served as delegate to the second Virginia Constitutional Convention in 1850. Elected again to the US House of Representatives in 1852, he served three terms, from 1853 until his death in 1859. He became chairman of the Committee on the District of Columbia from 1857 to 1858.

It is predominantly associated with the Barnegat Bay in New Jersey, just as the canoe-like Delaware Ducker is associated with the New Jersey marshes along the Delaware River near Philadelphia. Railbird skiffs and garvey-like sneakboxes are other American hunting-boat types. Typically, they were all used for hunting waterfowl and marsh birds but also have been used by trappers.  The Original Sneakbox  As with most American small craft, its origin is not well documented. It is generally accepted that Captain Hazelton Seaman invented the first sneakbox about 1836, in West Creek, New Jersey. It was usually built of Atlantic white cedar wood, known by many as Jersey cedar, which was once plentiful throughout the mid-Atlantic states. It was conceived as a low-profile, lightweight, seaworthy hunting craft that one man could easily handle in any of the weather conditions likely to be encountered in the Jersey marshes. The first printed description appeared in Forest and Stream on April 3, 1874 in a short letter from Robert B. White. White included a rough dimensional drawing that is recognizably a sneakbox. The caption indicates: a an Apron 1 1 1 shows where it is nailed to deck b b Cock-pit c Trunk d d d Stool [Decoy] Rack e e Rowlocks The thing with the U-shaped cutout represents the folding wooden oarlock used.  Nathaniel Bishop: Canoeist and Cruiser  It was the 1879 book Four Months in a Sneak Box by Nathaniel H. Bishop that put this small boat on the map. Bishop went down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers and eastward along the Gulf Coast into Florida in Centennial Republic, his sneakbox. It was something of a stunt in commemoration of the nation's 100th anniversary. Nevertheless, Four Months is one of the first small-boat camp-cruising narratives published in America, where the author was not an explorer or adventurer, but simply a sportsman or boating enthusiast. An e-book is here: Four Months in a Sneak-Box: A boat voyage of 2600 miles down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, and along the Gulf of Mexico. Bishop was born in Medford, Mass. He had an adventurous streak, and at 17 worked his way south from Massachusetts on a sailing ship, then hiked across South America. This is the subject of his first book (1869) The Pampas and Andes: A Thousand Miles' Walk Across South America. By 1872 he was a canoe enthusiast along the lines of British canoeist John \\"Rob Roy\\" MacGregor. Bishop was for many years the Secretary of the American Canoe Association. He was one of the association's founders. He ordered the 18-foot canoe Mayeta, built by J. S. Lamson, Bordentown, N.J, and started on a two-man voyage from Quebec. The voyage was abandoned because the canoe was too heavy, and Bishop apparently didn't like company. He obtained Maria Theresa, a 58-pound paper canoe built by Elisha Waters, Troy, N.Y., and started again. Bishop rigged his canoe with rowlocks; he did use a double paddle also, which brought a lot of comments and attention from Local Boatmen. and he did not sail Maria Theresa much on his Florida cruise 1874-5, published as Voyage of the Paper Canoe in 1878. After these three books, Bishop seems to have stopped writing except for correspondence concerning the ACA; but no one yet has attempted to create a bibliography of Bishop's later contributions to boating and sporting magazines. For a short biography of Nathaniel H. Bishop (1837‚Äì1902), see Brief Bishop Bio by Eric Eldred.  Cruising Sneakboxes  After Bishop rowed (he hardly used his sail) down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers in 1876, the boating press took notice and people began to develop sailing sneakboxes as an alternative for solo cruising to the sailing canoe. See this link for Early Drawings. Bishop's own words from Four Months about early sneakboxes are worth quoting: > This remarkable little boat has a history which does not reach very far back > into the present century. With the assistance of Mr. William Errickson of > Barnegat, and Dr. William P. Haywood of West Creek, Ocean County, New > Jersey, I have been able to rescue from oblivion and bring to the light of > day a correct history of the Barnegat sneak-box. Captain Hazelton Seaman, of > West Creek village, New Jersey, a boat-builder and an expert shooter of > wild-fowl, about the year 1836, conceived the idea of constructing for his > own use a low-decked boat, or gunning-punt, in which, when its deck was > covered with sedge, he could secrete himself from the wild-fowl while > gunning in Barnegat and Little Egg Harbor bays. It was important that the > boat should be sufficiently light to enable a single sportsman to pull her > from the water on to the low points of the bay shores. During the winter > months, when the great marshes were at times incrusted with snow, and the > shallow creeks covered with ice,--obstacles which must be crossed to reach > the open waters of the sound,--it would be necessary to use her as a sled, > to effect which end a pair of light oaken strips were screwed to the bottom > of the sneak-box, when she could be easily pushed by the gunner, and the > transportation of the oars, sail, blankets, guns, ammunition, and provisions > (all of which stowed under the hatch and locked up as snugly as if in a > strong chest) became a very simple matter. While secreted in his boat, on > the watch for fowl, with his craft hidden by a covering of grass or sedge, > the gunner could approach within shooting-distance of a flock of > unsuspicious ducks; and this being done in a sneaking manner (though Mr. > Seaman named the result of his first effort the \\"Devil's Coffin\\" the bay-men > gave her the sobriquet of \\"SNEAK-BOX\\"; and this name she has retained to the > present day). Since Captain Seaman built his \\"Devil's Coffin,\\" forty years > ago, the model has been improved by various builders, until it is believed > that it has almost attained perfection. The boat has no sheer, and sets low > in the water. This lack of sheer is supplied by a light canvas apron which > is tacked to the deck, and presents, when stretched upward by a stick two > feet long, a convex surface to a head sea. The water which breaks upon the > deck, forward of the cockpit, is turned off at the sides of the boat in > almost the same manner as a snow-plough clears a railroad track of snow. The > apron also protects the head and shoulders of the rower from cold head > winds. The first sneak-box built by Captain Seaman had a piece of canvas > stretched upon an oaken hoop, so fastened to the deck that when a head sea > struck the bow, the hoop and canvas were forced upward so as to throw the > water off its sides, thus effectually preventing its ingress into the hold > of the craft. The improved apron originated with Mr. John Crammer, Jr., a > short time after Captain Seaman built the first sneak-box. The second sneak- > box was constructed by Mr. Crammer; and afterwards Mr. Samuel Perine, an old > and much respected bay-man, of Barnegat, built the third one. The last two > men have finished their voyage of life, but \\"Uncle Haze,\\"--as he is > familiarly called by his many admirers,--the originator of the tiny craft > which may well be called multum in parvo, and which carried me, its single > occupant, safely and comfortably twenty-six hundred miles, from Pittsburgh > to Cedar Keys, still lives at West Creek, builds yachts as well as he does > sneak-boxes, and puts to the blush younger gunners by the energy displayed > and success attained in the vigorous pursuit of wildfowl shooting in the > bays which fringe the coast of Ocean County, New Jersey. A few years since, > this ingenious man invented an improvement on the marine life-saving car, > which has been adopted by the United States government; and during the year > 1875 he constructed a new ducking-punt with a low paddle-wheel at its stern, > for the purpose of more easily and secretly approaching flocks of wild-fowl. > The peculiar advantages of the sneak-box were known to but few of the > hunting and shooting fraternity, and, with the exception of an occasional > visitor, were used only by the oystermen, fishermen, and wild-fowl shooters > of Barnegat and Little Egg Harbor bays, until the New Jersey Southern > Railroad and its connecting branches penetrated to the eastern shores of New > Jersey, when educated amateur sportsmen from the cities quickly recognized > in the little gunning-punt all they had long desired to combine in one small > boat. Mr. Charles Hallock, in his paper the \\"Forest and Stream,\\" of April > 23, 1874, gave drawings and a description of the sneak-box, and fairly > presented its claims to public favor. The sneak-box is not a monopoly of any > particular builder, but it requires peculiar talent to build one,--the kind > of talent which enables one man to cut out a perfect axe-handle, while the > master-carpenter finds it difficult to accomplish the same thing. The best > yacht-builders in Ocean County generally fail in modelling a sneak-box, > while many second-rate mechanics along the shore, who could not possibly > construct a yacht that would sail well, can make a perfect sneak-box, or > gunning-skiff. All this may be accounted for by recognizing the fact that > the water-lines of the sneak-box are peculiar, and differ materially from > those of row-boats, sailboats, and yachts. Having a spoon-shaped bottom and > bow, the sneak-box moves rather over the water than through it, and this > peculiarity, together with its broad beam, gives the boat such stiffness > that two persons may stand upright in her while she is moving through the > water, and troll their lines while fishing, or discharge their guns, without > careening the boat; a valuable advantage not possessed by our best cruising > canoes. The boat sails well on the wind, though hard to pull against a > strong head sea. A fin-shaped centre-board takes the place of a keel. It can > be quickly removed from the trunk, or centre-board well, and stored under > the deck. The flatness of her floor permits the sneak-box to run in very > shallow water while being rowed or when sailing before the wind without the > centre-board. Some of these boats, carrying a weight of three hundred > pounds, will float in four to six inches of water. The favorite material for > boat-building in the United States is white cedar (Cupressus thyoides), > which grows in dense forests in the swamps along the coast of New Jersey, as > well as in other parts of North America. The wood is both white and brown, > soft, fine-grained, and very light and durable. No wood used in boat- > building can compare with the white cedar in resisting the changes from a > wet to a dry state, and vice versa. The tree grows tall and straight. The > lower part of the trunk with the diverging roots furnish knee timbers and > carlines for the sneak-box. The ribs or timbers, and the carlines, are > usually 1 √ó 1 inches in dimension, and are placed about ten inches apart. > The frame above and below is covered with half-inch cedar sheathing, which > is not less than six inches wide. The boat is strong enough to support a > heavy man upon its deck, and when well built will rank next to the seamless > paper boats of Mr. Waters of Troy, and the seamless wooden canoes of Messrs. > Herald, Gordon & Stephenson, of the province of Ontario, Canada, in freedom > from leakage. During a cruise of twenty-six hundred miles not one drop of > water leaked through the seams of the Centennial Republic. Her under > planking was nicely joined, and the seams calked with cotton wicking, and > afterwards filled with white-lead paint and putty. The deck planks, of seven > inches width, were not joined, but were tongued and grooved, the tongues and > grooves being well covered with a thick coat of white-lead paint. The item > of cost is another thing to be considered in regard to this boat. The usual > cost of a first-class canoe of seventy pounds' weight, built after the model > of the Rob Roy or Nautilus, with all its belongings, is about one hundred > and twenty-five dollars; and these figures deter many a young man from > enjoying the ennobling and healthful exercise of canoeing. A first-class > sneak-box, with spars, sail, oars, anchor, &c.;, can be obtained for > seventy-five dollars, and if several were ordered by a club they could > probably be bought for sixty-five dollars each. The price of a sneak-box, as > ordinarily built in Ocean County, New Jersey, is about forty dollars. The > Centennial Republic cost about seventy-five dollars, and a city boat-builder > would not duplicate her for less than one hundred and twenty-five dollars. > The builders of the sneak-boxes have not yet acquired the art of > overcharging their customers; they do not expect to receive more than one > dollar and fifty cents or two dollars per day for their labor; and some of > them are even so unwise as to risk their reputation by offering to furnish > these boats for twenty-five dollars each. Such a craft, after a little hard > usage, would leak as badly as most cedar canoes, and would be totally unfit > for the trials of a long cruise. The diagram given of the Centennial > Republic will enable the reader of aquatic proclivities to understand the > general principles upon which these boats are built. As they should be rated > as third-class freight on railroads, it is more economical for the amateur > to purchase a first-class boat at Barnegat, Manahawken, or West Creek, in > Ocean County, New Jersey, along the Tuckerton Railroad, than to have a > workman elsewhere, and one unacquainted with this peculiar model, experiment > upon its construction at the purchaser's cost, and perhaps loss. One bright > morning, in the early part of the fall of 1875, I trudged on foot down one > of the level roads which lead from the village of Manahawken through the > swamps to the edge of the extensive salt marshes that fringe the shores of > the bay.

Working Sneakboxes  Meanwhile, hunters continued to use the classic sneakbox. Eventually, among the many builders in the Jersey marshes, J. Howard Perrine of Perrine Boat Works became the most noted builder. Perrine's father Samuel was one of the pioneer sneakbox builders. The Ocean County (N.J.) Cultural and Heritage Commission provides several views of a working sneakbox: Hunter with gear, rowing; and a sneakbox in a flood.  Racing Sneakboxes  As time passed, the yachting fraternity based a racing boat on the working sneakbox by scaling it up, making it longer and beamier. This larger sneakbox had much more sail than a working sneakbox.  F. Slade Dale  Slade Dale was a yachtsman who lived on Barnegat Bay. He was involved in the development of the racing sneakbox, but appreciated the cruising qualities of sneakboxes and had two special boats, Crab and Sheldrake, built for a Florida cruise. In the fall of 1925, Dale and a companion took the sneakboxes, equipped with outboard motors and auxiliary sails from New York to Florida. By Sneakbox to Florida appeared in Yachting in 1927. These were more like the working sneakbox than the racing boat, and as the photo shows, were designed to be fully enclosed with hatches if necessary. *Dale's Sneakbox Sheldrake is displayed at the Toms River Maritime Museum.

Life He was born in Italica, Hispania Baetica, which was also the birthplace of Publius Aelius Hadrianus Afer, the emperor Hadrian's father. When Afer died about 86, Attianus and the future Emperor Trajan (another native of Italica) became the ten-year-old Hadrian's guardians.Historia Augusta, \\"Hadrian\\", 2; translated by Anthony Birley, Lives of the Later Caesars (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1976), p. 37 Otherwise nothing is known of Attianus's early career, but towards the end of Trajan's reign he was joint Praetorian Prefect with Servius Sulpicius Similis. While Similis remained at Rome, Attianus accompanied the Emperor on campaign in the East. =Imperial succession= Shortly before his death, Trajan was said to have composed a letter naming Hadrian as his adopted son and successor. Suspicions were raised because the copy of the letter that reached Rome bore Plotina's signature. It was rumoured that Attianus and the Empress Plotina had been lovers, both very fond of Hadrian their ward, and both present at Trajan's deathbed at Selinus in Cilicia in August 117, the two helped secure Hadrian's succession by forging Trajan's will.Simon Hornblower and Anthony Spawforth-E.A. (edd.), Oxford Classical Dictionary, Oxford University Press, 2003, p. 1214. Along with Plotina and Matidia, Attianus accompanied Trajan's body to Seleucia and his ashes to Rome. =During Hadrian's reign= Early in Hadrian's reign, Attianus counselled the emperor on his accession against various possible opponents, and, according to Hadrian's lost autobiography, was responsible for the murder of the ‚Äòfour consulars‚Äô whose deaths were an early stain on his reign. However, the new emperor resented Attianus's power, and, in 119, induced him to request to be relieved of the post of Praetorian Prefect.Historia Augusta, \\"Hadrian\\", 8; translated by Birley, Lives, p. 66 Attianus was given senatorial rank and the ornamenta consularia on his retirement, but nothing more is heard of him past that point.

It is the upper part of the neurocranium and covers the cranial cavity containing the brain. It forms the main component of the skull roof. The calvaria is made up of the superior portions of the frontal bone, occipital bone, and parietal bones. In the human skull, the sutures between the bones normally remain flexible during the first few years of postnatal development, and fontanelles are palpable. Premature complete ossification of these sutures is called craniosynostosis. In its use, feminine Latin noun with plural calvariae; however, many medical texts list the word as calvarium, neuter Latin noun with plural calvaria.  Structure  Resistance structures of calvaria The outer surface of the skull possesses a number of landmarks. The point at which the frontal bone and the two parietal bones meet is known as \\"Bregma\\". The point at which the two parietal and occipital bones meet is known as \\"Lambda\\". Not only do these landmarks indicate the fontanelle in newborns, they also act as reference points in medicine and surgery. The inner surface of the skull-cap is concave and presents depressions for the convolutions of the cerebrum, together with numerous furrows for the lodgement of branches of the meningeal vessels. Along the middle line is a longitudinal groove, narrow in front, where it commences at the frontal crest, but broader behind; it lodges the superior sagittal sinus, and its margins afford attachment to the falx cerebri. On either side of it are several depressions for the arachnoid granulations, and at its back part, the openings of the parietal foramina when these are present. It is crossed in front by the coronal suture and behind by the lambdoid suture, while the sagittal suture lies in the medial plane between the parietal bones. =Layers= The outer layer of the skull has been removed and shows the diploic veins and inner layer. Most bones of the calvaria consist of internal and external tables or layers of compact bone, separated by diplo√´. The diplo√´ is cancellous bone containing red bone marrow during life, through which run canals formed by diploic veins. The diplo√´ in a dried calvaria is not red because the protein was removed during preparation of the cranium. The internal table of bone is thinner than the external table, and in some areas there is only a thin plate of compact bone with no diplo√´. Calvarial bones are supplied by endosteal and periosteal sheaths which are innervated by the nociceptors, sensory, sympathetic, and parasympathetic nerves. Horizontal section of the mouse pups showed that the density of nerve fibers was highest in the region of forehead, temples, and the back of head which crossing the frontal, parietal, and interparietal bones. In the calvarial innervation in the adult mouse, CGRP-labeled fibers and peripherin were seen in the sutures, emissary canals, and bone marrow but not in diploe. Nerve fibers passing through the emissary canals and cavity of bone marrow provided the branches of periosteal and dural nerves whereas fibers from the sutures gave out to the dural nerves.

The construction of this railway favoured the development of the gold mining industry, logging, fisheries and the fur trade in Siberia and Russian Far East. It is over 2115 km in length, stretching across the Transbaikal Region and the Amur Oblast. The railway's main sections are: Kuenga-Uryum (204 km, 1907-1911); Uryum-Kerak (632 km, 1909-1913); Kerak-Deya with an offshoot to Blagoveshchensk (679 km, 1911-1915); Deya-Khabarovsk (481 km, 1915-1916). Ye.Yu.Podrutsky, Alexander Liverovsky, and V.V.Tregubov were the chief engineers, who oversaw the construction of the Amur Railway by approx. 54,000 workers (as of 1913), brought from Central Russia and Siberia (the Tsarist government specifically forbade the use of foreign workforce). Construction View inside a tunnel of the Amur Railway during construction In 1905, the city duma of Blagoveshchensk, urged by local merchants and industrialists, turned to the Council of Ministers with a request to build the Amur section of the Transsib. The Council of Ministers approved the decision to construct the Amur Railway with the support of Pyotr Stolypin. On 3 April 1908, they issued a decree \\"On the Commencement of the Construction of the Amur Railway by the Order of and at the Expense of the State\\".Although the Amur Railway was not mentioned by name, the interest of Tsar Nicholas II in the importance of its construction was alluded to by Kaiser Wilhelm II in Letter LIV of the Willy-Nicky correspondence, written from Berlin on 11 January 1910. http://www.gwpda.org/wwi-www/willnick/wilnicke.htm The construction itself took place in scarcely populated permafrost areas under harsh climatic conditions. Construction sites were divided into the western, middle, and eastern sections. In 1907-1913, they built the western section of the railway from Kuenga to Uryum. First, the engineers had to connect the Shilka and the Amur with the railroad under construction in order to be able to deliver material and workforce. They had to build a temporary road in the swampy middle section of the future Amur Railway for the purpose of delivering the ballast for the line. Often, the whole finished parts of the road would disappear into the swamps. In 1912, a talented engineer Alexander Liverovsky was put in charge of the construction of the eastern section of the Amur Railway. For the first time in railroad construction, earth-moving works were mechanised. The workers used ten excavators and several machines for mortar mixing and rock grinding. Also, they built a number of repair shops and sawmills, therefore there was no need to transport railroad ties and squared timber to construction sites. In 1914, the western and eastern sections of the Amur Railway came together at the Obluchye railway station, making it possible for trains to go through. Interesting facts about the Amur Railway The Amur Railway is known for its unique man-made structures, such as the Khabarovsk Bridge over the Amur River (considered the longest in Imperial Russia, Soviet Union, and Eurasia for decades; designed by Lavr Proskuryakov) and the first permafrost tunnel in the world with the use of insulation between its outer surface and the rock. At the suggestion of Alexander Liverovsky, the engineers devised a method of building piers with the use of heated concrete in below-zero weather conditions. They also built railway stations, railroad workshops, elementary schools and hospitals along the Amur Railway. Before the bridge was operational, they had arranged a train ferry in summertime and horse-drawn train platforms to cross the icebound Amur River in wintertime. In 1912, the government began issuing up to 400 rubles in allowances and necessary household articles to those workers who had decided to settle in this region. The Amur Railway was put under the authority of the Ministry of Communications with its administration in Khabarovsk. In 1922, the railway was transferred to the authority of the People's Commissariat for Communications (–ù–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω—ã–π –ö–æ–º–∏—Å—Å–∞—Ä–∏–∞—Ç –ü—É—Ç–µ–π –°–æ–æ–±—â–µ–Ω–∏—è). In 1959, the Amur Railway and the Transbaikal section of the Transsib were merged to form the Transbaikal Railway. The construction of the Amur Railway was completed before the outbreak of World War I and cost over 250,000 million rubles. The eastern section of the railroad alone cost 73 million rubles. The famous Norwegian explorer and geographer Fridtjof Nansen referred to the Trans-Siberian Railway as a \\"technical wonder\\". Its construction favoured the rapid development of formerly backward regions of Siberia and Far East.

The plot concerns escaped convicts. The picture is notable for the feature film debuts of both Tracy and Bogart. Despite the order of billing, Tracy's and Bogart's roles were equally large, and this is the only movie in which they both appeared. Fox remade the film in 1938. Plot Two convicts, St. Louis (Spencer Tracy) and Dannemora Dan (Warren Hymer) befriend another convict named Steve (Humphrey Bogart), who is in love with woman's-prison inmate Judy (Claire Luce). Steve is paroled, promising Judy that he will wait for her release five months later. He returns to his hometown in New England and his mother's home. However, he is followed there by Judy's former \\"employer\\", the scam artist Frosby (Gaylord Pendleton). Frosby threatens to expose Steve's prison record if the latter refuses to go along with a scheme to defraud his neighbors. Steve goes along with it until Frosby defrauds his mother. At this moment St. Louis and Dannemora Dan break out of prison and come to Steve's aid, taking away a gun he planned to use on the fraudster, instead stealing back bonds stolen by Frosby. They return to prison in time for its annual baseball game against a rival penitentiary. The film closes with St. Louis on the pitcher's mound with his catcher, Dannemora Dan, presumably ready to lead their team to victory.Up the River at TCM Movie Database Cast * Spencer Tracy as Saint Louis * Claire Luce as Judy Fields * Warren Hymer as Dannemora Dan * Humphrey Bogart as Steve Jordan * Gaylord Pendleton as Frosby * William Collier, Sr. as Pop * Joan Lawes as Jean Production Tracy had previously starred in two Warner Bros. shorts earlier the same year and Bogart had been an unbilled extra in a silent film, as well as starring in two shorts. Up the River is the first credited feature film for both actors, and is the only film that Tracy and Bogart ever appeared in together. Both had been cast in The Desperate Hours in 1955, but neither would consent to second billing, so the role intended for Tracy went to Fredric March instead. Bogart is listed fourth after top-billed Tracy in Up the River but his role is equally large and his likeness is featured prominently on posters that did not include Tracy's image. This is the only film Bogart made with director John Ford. Nearly three decades later, Ford directed Tracy again in The Last Hurrah (1958).

Face the Music opened on Broadway in 1932, and has had several subsequent regional and New York stagings. The popular song \\"Let's Have Another Cup of Coffee\\" was introduced in the musical by J. Harold Murray. History The musical was written as a political satire, specifically spoofing political and police corruption that the Seabury Commission was investigating. It also satirized show business, showing the far-fetched economies, such as seeing 4 films with a room and bath for 10¬¢. The musical did not ignore the Depression but rather found humor in it. There were many titles considered, among them Nickels and Dimes, but Berlin came up with the final title. \\"New York Police Satirized on Stage\\", The New York Times, February 4, 1932, p. 25Brown, pp. 77- 79 Synopsis Producer Hal Reisman desperately seeks backers for his Broadway show.

Garderen was a separate municipality until 1818, when it was merged with Barneveld. Location The village is located in an agricultural enclave on the west side of the Veluwe. It has been a tourist destination for a long time, owing to its bed & breakfasts with high-quality food, but it has always remained a conservative and religious village. Services The church seen from the De Hoop (Hope) mill Facilities in the village include a primary school, a medical practice, a cemetery, De Hoop windmill, various hotels, restaurants, cafes and snack bars, camping grounds, and basic shops. Several dozen other companies are located in the village. The village contains several churches: a HHK (Restored Reformed Church) congregation, a reformed congregation within the PKN (Protestant Churches of the Netherlands), and a Continuing Reformed Church (Gereformeerde Kerk). Garderen center is an administrative center for the villages of Speuld, Stroe and Kootwijk. Residents of the surrounding neighborhoods of Houtdorp, Meerveld, Nieuw-Milligen and Koudhoorn have cultural and economic links to Garderen. History Garderen is older than the village of Barneveld and was originally the capital of the later city of Barneveld. The church of the Dutch Reformed Church was originally built in the eleventh century. The current tower dates from the fourteenth century. From 1812 to 1818 Garderen was an independent municipality with a separate administrative designation. After this it became part of the municipality of Barneveld. Serbian monument Serbian monument in Garderen At the cemetery, there is a Serbian war memorial, in memory of 29 Serb soldiers who were killed by Spanish flu shortly after the First World War. They were part of a large group of Serbian soldiers who were temporarily housed in the 'Lombok' barracks at the nearby Camp Milligen. Their remains were exhumed in 1938 and reinterred in a mausoleum in Jind≈ôichovice. Renovation of the monument began In 2007, and an extension was gradually undertaken.

Early life A resident of New Haven, Connecticut, Nett enlisted in the Connecticut National Guard in 1940 at age 17. The minimum enlistment age was 18 years, but Nett was able to join by creasing his birth certificate so that his year of birth was obscured. His initial assignment was with the 102nd Infantry Regiment, part of the 43rd Infantry Division. Two years later, he was stationed at Fort Benning, Georgia, where he was graduated from Officer Candidate School. Nett was then sent to the Philippines, where he met his future wife, Frances, an Army nurse. World War II By December 14, 1944, Nett was a lieutenant in Company E of the 305th Infantry Regiment, 77th Infantry Division. On that day, near Cognon, Leyte, during the Battle of Ormoc Bay, Nett led his company in an assault against a heavily fortified Japanese position. Despite being seriously wounded twice in hand-to-hand fighting, he continued to lead his men until being wounded a third time. After making arrangements for the leadership of his company, he left the front lines to seek medical aid. Nett was able to rejoin his unit for the Okinawa Campaign. His division was then sent to Cebu and began training for the planned invasion of Japan. The operation was canceled after the surrender of Japan in August 1945. On February 8, 1946, Nett was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions at Cognon. A ceremony was held in his hometown of New Haven, and President Harry S. Truman was to have presented him with the medal there, but had to cancel in order to attend to the formation of the United Nations in California, Nett told a reporter. Medal of Honor citation Nett's official Medal of Honor citation reads: > He commanded Company E in an attack against a reinforced enemy battalion > which had held up the American advance for 2 days from its entrenched > positions around a 3-story concrete building. With another infantry company > and armored vehicles, Company E advanced against heavy machinegun and other > automatic weapons fire with Lt. Nett spearheading the assault against the > strongpoint. During the fierce hand-to-hand encounter which ensued, he > killed 7 deeply entrenched Japanese with his rifle and bayonet and, although > seriously wounded, gallantly continued to lead his men forward, refusing to > relinquish his command.

Nett provided an inspiring example for his > men and was instrumental in the capture of a vital strongpoint. Postwar life Nett continued to serve in the Army after the war. He also served in both the Korean War and the Vietnam War. In 1978 Nett retired from the Army after 38 years of service at the rank of colonel. He gave frequent talks on leadership and duty, lecturing to every class of the Officer Candidate School (OCS); he was frequently invited to speak to the Ranger Regiment at Fort Benning.

Life John Passmore was born on 9 September 1914 in Manly, Sydney, where he grew up.John Passmore, Memoirs of a Semi-Detached Australian, Melbourne University Press, Carlton South, 1997, p. 17. He was educated at Sydney Boys High School.Sydney High School Old Boys Union, ORDER OF AUSTRALIA He subsequently graduated from the University of Sydney with first-class honours in English literature and philosophy whilst studying with a view to become a secondary-school teacher. In 1934 he accepted the position of assistant lecturer in philosophy at the University of Sydney, continuing teaching there until 1949. In 1948 he went to study at the University of London. From 1950 to 1955 he was (the first) professor of philosophy at the University of Otago in New Zealand. In 1955 he spent a year at the University of Oxford on a Carnegie grant. Upon his return to Australia he took up a post at the Institute of Advanced Studies at the Australian National University, where he was professor of Philosophy in the Research School of Social Sciences from 1958 to 1979. In 1960 he was Ziskind visiting professor at Brandeis University in the United States. He subsequently lectured in England, the United States, Mexico, Japan, and in various European countries. He also served as a director and then later as governor of the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust. In 1994 he was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC), Australia's highest civilian honour. He died on 25 July 2004 and was survived by his wife Doris and two daughters. Work Passmore was as much a historian of ideas as a philosopher, and his scholarship always paid careful attention to the complex historical context of philosophical problems. He published about twenty books, many of which have been translated. Philosopher Frank Jackson notes that Passmore \\"shaped public debate and opened up philosophy and history of ideas to the wider world\\". In his book Man's Responsibility for Nature (1974) Passmore argued that there is urgent need to change our attitude to the environment, and that humans cannot continue unconstrained exploitation of the biosphere. However, he rejected the view that we need to abandon the Western tradition of scientific rationalism, and was unsympathetic towards attempts to articulate environmental concern through radical revisions of our ethical framework, as advocated by deep ecologists, which he conceived as misguided mysticism or irrationalism. Passmore was very skeptical about attempts to attribute intrinsic value to nature, and his preferred position was of valuing nature in terms of what it contributes to the flourishing of sentient creatures (including humans). According to William Grey of the International Society for Environmental Ethics, his \\"unequivocal anthropocentrism made him a reference point in the discourse of environmental ethics and many treatises in field begin with (or include) a refutation of his views\\". Passmore described himself as a \\"pessimistic humanist\\" who regarded neither human beings nor human societies as perfectible.\\"Why I Am a Secular Humanist\\" Free Inquiry, Wntr 1997 v18 n1 p18(5) \\"I am willing to admit that there is no deed so dreadful that we can safely say 'no human being could do that' and no belief so absurd that we can safely say 'no human being could believe that.' But on the other side I point to the marvelous achievements of human beings in science and art and acts of courage, love, and self-sacrifice. I call myself a pessimistic humanist because I do not regard human beings or their societies as being perfectible but a humanist I nonetheless am.\\" Bibliography *Reading and Remembering (1942, 1943, 1963) *Talking Things Over (1945) *Ralph Cudworth (1951) *Hume's Intentions (1952) *Philosophical Reasoning (1961) *Joseph Priestley (1965) *A Hundred Years of Philosophy (1957, 1968) *The Perfectibility of Man (1970) *Man's Responsibility for Nature (1974, 1980) *Science and Its Critics (1978) *The Philosophy of Teaching (1980) *The Limits of Government (1981) (the 1981 Boyer Lectures) *Recent Philosophers (1985) *Serious Art: A Study of the Concept in All the Major Arts (1991) *Memoirs of a Semi-detached Australian (1997) References External links *\\"Papers of John Passmore\\" -- National Library of Australia *\\"John Passmore\\" -- tribute from Allan Saunders (ABC Radio National transcript) *\\"John Passmore\\" -- Daily Telegraph obituary *\\"His ideas shaped public debate\\" -- obituary by Frank Jackson in The Sydney Morning Herald * \\"Interview with Emeritus Professor John Passmore\\" ANU Oral History Archive Interview conducted 17 May 1991 * \\"Passmore, John\\", Max Charlesworth, A Companion to Philosophy in Australia and New Zealand *Bryan Magee talks to John Passmore about Hume for The Great Philosophers (1987) [at YouTube] Category:1914 births Category:2004 deaths Category:20th-century Australian philosophers Category:21st-century Australian philosophers Category:Alumni of the University of London Category:Alumni of the University of Oxford Category:Analytic philosophers Category:Australian ethicists Category:20th- century Australian historians Category:Companions of the Order of Australia Category:Contemporary philosophers Category:Cultural critics Category:Epistemologists Category:Film theorists Category:Historians of philosophy Category:History of ideas Category:History of philosophy Category:Metaphysicians Category:Moral philosophers Category:Ontologists Category:People from Manly, New South Wales Category:Philosophers of culture Category:Philosophers of education Category:Philosophers of ethics and morality Category:Philosophers of history Category:Philosophers of literature Category:Philosophers of mind Category:Philosophers of pessimism Category:Philosophers of social science Category:Philosophers of technology Category:Australian social commentators Category:Social critics Category:Social philosophers Category:University of Otago faculty Category:University of Sydney alumni ","title":"John Passmore"},{"id":"9446374","text":"Geesteren is a village in the eastern Dutch, located in the municipality of Berkelland, Gelderland.

The history of the Scotland national football team dates back to the first ever international football match in 1872. Until the Second World War, Scotland mainly competed against the other Home Nations in the British Home Championship, with the most keenly contested fixture being the match with England. The Scottish Football Association, which governs the team, joined the international governing body FIFA in 1910, but along with the other Home Nations withdrew from FIFA in 1928. This meant that Scotland did not participate in the World Cups of 1930, 1934 or 1938. The Home Nations rejoined FIFA after the Second World War and Scotland then started to participate in international competitions. Scotland have since participated in eight World Cups and two European Championship tournaments, but have never progressed beyond the first stage. Scotland have not qualified for a tournament since the 1998 World Cup. Early history (1872‚Äì1939) Scotland and England are the oldest national football teams in the world. Teams representing the two sides first competed at the Oval in five matches between 1870 and 1872. The two countries contested the first official international football match, at Hamilton Crescent in Partick, Scotland on 30 November 1872. The match ended in a goalless draw. All eleven players who represented Scotland that day played for Glasgow amateur club Queen's Park. Over the next forty years, Scotland played matches exclusively against the other three Home nations‚ÄîEngland, Wales and Ireland. The British Home Championship began in 1883, making these games competitive. The encounters against England were particularly fierce and a rivalry quickly developed. The first international against Wales came on 25 March 1876 when the Scots were comfortable 4‚Äì0 winners. The Scotland national team in 1895. Between 1872 and 1929, Scotland only played matches against the other Home Nations of England, Ireland and Wales. Initially the matches between the Home Nations were merely annual friendly fixtures, but the introduction of the British Home Championship in 1884 provided competitive international football for the first time. The lack of games against other opponents was largely due to the assumed dominance of the Home Nations in football and the logistical problems of arranging internationals in the days before air travel was commonplace. During these early years, defeats for Scotland were something of a rarity, losing just two of their first 43 international matches. It wasn't until a 2‚Äì0 home defeat by Ireland in 1903 that Scotland lost a match to a team other than England. Scotland won 26 of the 51 British Home Championships held before the Second World War, sharing nine of those titles. The 7‚Äì2 defeat by the Scots in 1878 stood England's record loss until 1954. Another particularly notable Scotland win against England was a 5‚Äì1 win at Wembley against England in 1928, which led to that team being dubbed the Wembley Wizards. However, the Scottish eleven in that match never played together again, and soon a dispute with the English authorities over the release of players in 1930 led to the SFA only selecting home-based players for some time. There had been eight 'Anglos' involved in the 1928 victory, but it would be a decade later before so many were involved in the fixture again. The SFA joined FIFA in 1910, but the relationship between FIFA and the Home Nations was fraught. All of them withdrew from FIFA in 1928 in a dispute over payments to amateur players. Scotland played their first match outside the British Isles in 1929, beating Norway 7‚Äì3 in Bergen. Scotland contested more friendly matches against continental opposition and enjoyed wins against Germany, the Netherlands and France before being beaten 5‚Äì0 by the Austrian Wunderteam and 3‚Äì0 by Italy. Due to their withdrawal from FIFA, Scotland did not participate in the 1930 FIFA World Cup. Several Scottish-born players played for the United States, who reached the semi- finals. They lost 6-1 to Argentina, with Jim Brown scoring the American goal. 1950s Scotland had to wait until 1954 before taking part in their first World Cup, even though they had qualified for the 1950 FIFA World Cup. Two places were allocated to the Home Nations with the 1950 British Home Championship acting as a qualifying group. However, the SFA stated that they would only send a team to the World Cup if they won the Home Championship. Going into their last game with England this was a possibility, but a 1‚Äì0 defeat meant that Scotland finished second behind England and the SFA declined to send the national side to the World Cup. Scottish-born Ed McIlvenny was part of the United States team that beat England 1‚Äì0 at the finals. The SFA took a more relaxed stance for the next World Cup and Scotland qualified along with England from a combined World Cup qualifying group and British Home Championship in second place. Andy Beattie was appointed as the team's first ever manager, a position he held on a part-time basis as he was also managing Huddersfield Town. Beattie resigned during the World Cup after the SFA had decided to take only 13 players, despite FIFA allowing 22 to be selected. Scotland were beaten 1‚Äì0 and 7‚Äì0 by Austria and Uruguay respectively in the finals. the defeat by Uruguay is the heaviest defeat that Scotland have ever suffered. Scotland also qualified for the 1958 World Cup ahead of Spain, and in the same year achieved a friendly win away to World Cup holders West Germany. The team earned their first World Cup point with a 1‚Äì1 draw with Yugoslavia, but they lost their other two matches to Paraguay and France and therefore finished bottom of their group. Matt Busby was due to manage the team at the World Cup, but due to the severe injuries he suffered in the Munich Air Disaster, trainer Dawson Walker took charge of the team. 1960s The British Home Championship was won in 1962 and 1963 under the management of Ian McColl. Jock Stein, John Prentice and Malky McDonald all then had brief spells as manager. Bobby Brown was appointed Scotland manager in 1967. His first match as manager was something of a daunting one, against the 1966 World Cup winners England at Wembley. Despite including four Lisbon Lions and other greats including Denis Law, Jim Baxter and Billy Bremner, the team were considered underdogs against England, who were unbeaten in 19 internationals. Scotland emerged with a famous 3‚Äì2 victory, with the goals scored by Denis Law, Bobby Lennox and debutant Jim McCalliog. The victory led fans to call Scotland the \\"unofficial world champions\\". Towards the end of the match, Scotland winger Jim Baxter famously played keepie uppie at walking pace as he tormented the opposition. The Herald writer Glyn Edwards described the scene as follows: Despite the famous victory at Wembley, Scotland missed out on the chance to play a quarter-final match against Spain in the 1968 European Championship because they finished one point below England in their qualifying group. The group was the total of the results in the 1967 and 1968 British Home Championships. Bobby Brown's managership continued to be inconsistent, as the team failed to qualify for the 1970 World Cup. 1970s Tommy Docherty was appointed as manager in 1971 and achieved some short-term success, including sharing a British Home Championship. He resigned from the Scotland job to become manager of Manchester United. =1974 World Cup= Willie Ormond was appointed Scotland manager in 1973. Despite losing his first match in charge, a 5‚Äì0 thrashing by England in the SFA Centenary Match, the team qualified for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, their first in 16 years. Scotland qualified by winning 3 of their 4 games in a group including Czechoslovakia and Denmark. At the finals in West Germany, Scotland remained unbeaten but failed to progress beyond the group stages on goal difference after beating Zaire 2‚Äì0 and drawing 0‚Äì0 and 1‚Äì1 with Brazil and Yugoslavia respectively. Scotland also shared the 1974 British Home Championship with England but failed to qualify for the 1976 European Championship. Willie Ormond resigned in 1977 after several minor breaches of player discipline. =1978 World Cup= Scotland appointed Ally MacLeod in May 1977 with qualification for the 1978 World Cup far from assured. Hopes were raised when, within a month of MacLeod's appointment, the team won the 1977 British Home Championship by beating England 2‚Äì1 at Wembley. After the game the Tartan Army infamously staged a pitch invasion during which the pitch was ripped up and the crossbar was broken. Scotland went on to assure qualification for the 1978 World Cup with victories over Czechoslovakia and a key victory over Wales at Anfield. They beat Wales largely thanks to a controversial penalty kick that was given for handball by a Welsh player, but the ball appeared to have been handled by Joe Jordan. Kenny Dalglish then sealed the victory with a memorable diving header. During the buildup to the tournament, MacLeod fuelled the hopes and dreams of the nation by stating that even if Scotland didn't win the World Cup, they would most definitely come home with a medal of some kind. When asked what his plans were for after the World Cup, MacLeod quipped \\"Defend it!\\". As the squad left for the finals in Argentina, they were given a rapturous send off as they were paraded around a packed Hampden Park in an open-top bus. Thousands more fans lined the route to Prestwick Airport as the team set off for Argentina. Things began to go wrong soon after, however, as a row between players and the SFA regarding bonus payments began to emerge. Despite this, Scotland opened up their World Cup campaign against Peru and things appeared to be going well as a Joe Jordan goal put Scotland 1‚Äì0 up after just 14 minutes. They looked even better when they were awarded a penalty kick, but Don Masson spurned the chance to put them two up and Peru were level by half-time. After the break they took control of the match and a late second half double from Te√≥filo Cubillas condemned Scotland to a 3‚Äì1 defeat. Willie Johnston tested positive for a drug test after the game and was subsequently sent home in disgrace. Scotland again took the lead in their second match against Iran but a 60th-minute equaliser from Iraj Danaeifard saw Scotland's World Cup hopes hanging by a thread. The disconsolate and shell- shocked mood of the nation was reflected by footage of Ally MacLeod in the dugout with his head in his hands. After taking just 1 point from their opening two games, Scotland had to defeat one of the tournament favourites, the Netherlands, by three clear goals to qualify. Despite the Dutch taking the lead, Scotland fought back to lead 3‚Äì1 with goals from Kenny Dalglish and a double from Archie Gemmill, the second of which is generally regarded as the best goal in Scotland's history as he beat three Dutch defenders before lifting the ball over goalkeeper Jan Jongbloed. The joy was short lived, however, as within three minutes the Dutch striker Johnny Rep had pulled a goal back and the match finished 3‚Äì2. Scotland bowed out of the tournament on goal difference for the second successive World Cup. After the finals MacLeod took charge of only one more match, a 3‚Äì2 defeat by Austria in the first match of the 1980 European Championship qualifiers, before resigning. 1980s Alex Ferguson managed Scotland at the 1986 FIFA World Cup, having stepped in after the sudden death of Jock Stein. Jock Stein was appointed as Scotland manager in 1978. After failing to qualify for Euro 1980, Scotland qualified for their third successive World Cup finals from a group consisting of Sweden, Portugal, Israel and Northern Ireland, losing just one match in the process. At the finals, Scotland were eliminated from the tournament on goal difference for a third successive World Cup. An opening 5‚Äì2 win over New Zealand was followed by a 4‚Äì1 defeat by Brazil, despite Scotland taking the lead through a goal from David Narey which pundit Jimmy Hill infamously described as a \\"toe poke\\". Scotland were eliminated by a 2‚Äì2 draw with the Soviet Union, with the key Soviet goal being caused by a mix-up between Willie Miller and Alan Hansen. Scotland once again failed to qualify for the European Championships, as they won just one match in their qualifying group. Despite this, the team qualified for their fourth successive World Cup in dramatic circumstances. Scotland went into their last qualification match needing a point to earn a play-off match. With Wales leading 1‚Äì0, Scotland were awarded a penalty kick with just nine minutes remaining, which was scored by Davie Cooper. As the players and fans celebrated the final score of 1‚Äì1, rumours began to circulate that manager Jock Stein had suffered a heart attack, from which he soon died. Stein's assistant Alex Ferguson took the role of manager on a part-time caretaker basis, as he was still managing his successful Aberdeen side. Scotland won the qualifying play-off against Australia 2‚Äì0 on aggregate, but they went out of the World Cup with just one point from their three matches, as the team lost to Denmark and West Germany. The final match against Uruguay ended in a goalless draw, despite the Uruguayans having a player sent off in the opening minutes. The SFA chief executive Ernie Walker memorably described the Uruguayans as \\"animals\\". Ferguson relinquished the Scotland job after the World Cup and moved on to Manchester United a few months later. Following the 1986 FIFA World Cup, Andy Roxburgh took charge of Scotland for the 1988 European Championship qualifying section. Scotland performed poorly in the qualifying group, although an away victory against Bulgaria handed qualification to the Republic of Ireland. Following this failure, Scotland regrouped for the 1990 World Cup and qualified narrowly. They beat France 2‚Äì0 at Hampden Park in heavy rain, with Mo Johnston scoring twice. Scotland looked on course to qualify comfortably, but they then lost heavily in both France and Yugoslavia, leaving them needing to avoid defeat at home to Norway in the final game. Scotland were leading 1‚Äì0 when a bad error from goalkeeper Jim Leighton allowed the Norwegians to equalise. Had the Norwegians scored again, Scotland would have been out, but the 65,000 crowd breathed a sigh of relief when the final whistle went. 1990s =1990 World Cup= The team went into the 1990 World Cup finals with some confidence thanks to beating World Cup holders Argentina 1‚Äì0 in a friendly match, with Stewart McKimmie scoring the only goal. In their opening World Cup match, however, the team shockingly lost 1‚Äì0 to World Cup debutants Costa Rica. They recovered to win the following match against Sweden 2‚Äì1, with Stuart McCall and Mo Johnston scoring. This left Scotland realistically needing a point from their final game against Brazil to qualify. Scotland held the score at 0‚Äì0 for eighty minutes, but then conceded a goal by Careca after Leighton had fumbled a long-range shot. The team could still have qualified for the last 16 with favourable results in other matches, but the other results went against Scotland, who were again eliminated at the group stage. =Euro 92= The UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying campaign was unspectacular, but effective, allowing Scotland to make their first appearance in a European Championship Finals. A 1‚Äì0 defeat away to Romania looked to have ended their chances, but a 1‚Äì1 draw between Bulgaria and Romania in the final group match allowed Scotland to squeeze through. The team were knocked out of the first round of the finals due to losses against Holland and Germany, but the final match produced a consolation 3‚Äì0 win over the former Soviet Union. The Scotland fans won an award from UEFA for their superb behaviour in the tournament, which changed the stereotype that had been set by the Wembley pitch invasion of 1977. =1994 World Cup qualifying= Scotland faced a tough group in the bid to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, as they were drawn with Italy, Portugal and Switzerland. Scotland lost their opening match in Switzerland 3‚Äì1, with Richard Gough sent off for a deliberate handball. Scotland were playing away from their normal home stadium of Hampden Park because of redevelopment work for an all-seater stadium and were able to grind out goalless draws against both Italy and Portugal at Ibrox towards the end of 1992. After a 3‚Äì0 win against Malta at Ibrox the moment of truth came when the team were destroyed 5‚Äì0 by Portugal in Lisbon in April 1993. Ally McCoist broke his leg during the match, after which Roxburgh said \\"a team died out there\\". The match itself is considered one of the worst results in the history of the national team. In 2015, Scotland manager Gordon Strachan referenced the match when talking about creating change in Scottish football: \\"Funnily enough, I felt that when Scotland got beat 5-0 by Portugal and Ally McCoist broke his leg. There was an outcry about the standard. I said it at that time, but only after another 20 years have passed do I feel that I can affect things, and performance director Brian McClair can affect things and the SFA can affect things\\". Captain Richard Gough played his last match for the team, after he fell out with Roxburgh. When Craig Brown was appointed as manager, Gough said he wanted to play for Scotland again, but Brown refused to bring him back and ended his international career. Andy Roxburgh's final match in charge was a 1‚Äì1 draw against Switzerland at Pittodrie in September 1993 that mathematically ended the chance of qualification for the World Cup. It was a significant moment in Scottish football history because it meant that Scotland would not be at the World Cup for the first time since 1970. =Craig Brown= After Andy Roxburgh resigned as manager, Craig Brown took control, initially as caretaker. His first match was a 3‚Äì1 defeat against Italy at the Stadio Olimpico in a dead World Cup qualifying rubber. Scotland were well motivated to qualify for Euro 96 because of the failure to qualify for the World Cup and Euro 96 was to be held in England. The team only lost once in the qualifying section. The key match was a 1‚Äì0 home victory over Greece in August 1995. Ally McCoist scored the only goal of the game, moments after coming on as a substitute, in what was his first match for his country since he had broken his leg in the thrashing by Portugal two years earlier. Scotland's first match of the tournament was a goalless draw against Holland at Villa Park. The next match was against England at Wembley, which was the first time that the sides had met since the annual fixture had stopped in 1989. An Alan Shearer header early in the second half gave England the lead, but Scotland were awarded a penalty kick with less than 20 minutes left. David Seaman saved Gary McAllister's penalty, and Paul Gascoigne scored a wonder goal minutes later to end the game as a contest. Having looked like they were all but out of the tournament, Scotland were given hope of qualifying for the quarter-finals. While they were in the process of beating Switzerland 1‚Äì0 at Villa Park, England were beating Holland 4‚Äì0 at Wembley, which gave a combination of scores that would have put Scotland through on goal difference. Patrick Kluivert then scored a goal for Holland that, in other circumstances have been no more than a late consolation, but it knocked Scotland out on goals scored. Scotland moved onto the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifying section, where they earned a good position by beating qualification rivals Sweden and Austria at home. During the section Scotland were part of an infamous incident, the \\"game that never was\\" against Estonia. Estonia had refused to turn up for the kick-off on time, which had been rearranged due to the poor quality of the floodlights at the Kadrioru Stadium in Tallinn. John Collins kicked off the match for Scotland against nobody, which led the Tartan Army present to sing: The referee blew his whistle to signal the end of the \\"match\\" after a few seconds. Scotland expected to be awarded a walkover win, but the Swedish President of UEFA Lennart Johansson controversially ordered the match to be replayed in Monaco, where Scotland could only draw 0‚Äì0. Despite this debacle, the team eventually sealed qualification in October 1997 with a 2‚Äì0 home victory against Latvia thanks to goals from Kevin Gallacher and Gordon Durie. Scotland were drawn against defending champions Brazil in the opening game of the World Cup. John Collins converted a penalty kick to level the score at 1‚Äì1 after Cesar Sampaio had scored an early goal, but a Tom Boyd own goal led to a 2‚Äì1 defeat. Scotland then drew 1‚Äì1 against Norway in Bordeaux with Craig Burley scoring for Scotland. This left Scotland with a chance of qualifying going into the final match against Morocco, but they lost 3‚Äì0 and were again eliminated at the opening stage. Scotland earned a favourable draw in qualifying for Euro 2000, having qualified for the previous two tournaments, but it proved to be a struggle. Their first match ended in a goalless draw away against Lithuania. Against Estonia at Tynecastle they twice went behind but eventually won 3‚Äì2 thanks to two late strikes from substitute Billy Dodds. Goalkeeper Jim Leighton retired from international football game after being blamed for the Estonian goals. Gary McAllister was booed by a section of the crowd during a 2‚Äì1 defeat by the Czech Republic at Celtic Park, which led to his decision to retire from international football. An embarrassing draw in the Faroe Islands followed. Four days later, Scotland went 2‚Äì0 up through goals Paul Ritchie and Allan Johnston against the Czech Republic in Prague, but the team eventually collapsed to a 3‚Äì2 defeat. Largely due to the poor quality of the group outside the Czechs, who won all of their games, Scotland finished second in the group and progressed to a qualifying play‚Äìoff against England. In the first leg of the play‚Äìoff England won 2‚Äì0 at Hampden with Paul Scholes scoring both goals. Despite losing the home game and appearing to be out of contention, Scotland went to Wembley and won 1‚Äì0 with Don Hutchison scoring. It was a superb Wembley victory for Scotland, but it was a Pyrrhic victory as Scotland failed to qualify. 2000s After being unlucky in qualifying for Euro 2000, Scotland were nowhere near the play-off stage as they failed to qualify for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. The team's failure to win against either Croatia or Belgium, their main rivals for qualification home or away was a key factor. This was despite taking a 2‚Äì0 lead at Hampden Park against Belgium, who had a player sent off in the incident that led to the second goal. Scotland then conceded two goals, including one in the last minute, allowing Belgium to escape with a 2‚Äì2 draw. When Scotland were well beaten 2‚Äì0 in the away match in Brussels, it sparked the end of several international careers with Paul Lambert, Billy Dodds and Tom Boyd all announcing their retirements after the defeat. Lambert would be persuaded back by incoming manager Berti Vogts but not before Craig Brown officially resigned from his job after 8 years in charge. His final match in charge was against Latvia in which Scotland won 2‚Äì1 at Hampden Park. Towards the end of his tenure, Brown was criticised by the media for persisting with an ageing core of players. =Berti Vogts= Berti Vogts, the first foreigner to manage Scotland. The SFA hired the first ever foreign manager of the national team when they appointed former Germany manager Berti Vogts in February 2002. Vogts signalled his intentions to blood young players after previous manager Craig Brown had stuck with the same group of players that he had inherited. In Vogts' first match in charge against France at the Stade de France, Scotland were hammered 5‚Äì0 against the World and European champions. A number of friendly matches followed arranged in the first half of 2002, including a tour of the Far East. Scotland lost all of these matches, including a 4‚Äì1 defeat against South Korea. The team did manage to win 4‚Äì0 against a Hong Kong League XI. Vogts' team started the qualifying section for UEFA Euro 2004 in the Faroe Islands. Scotland went 2‚Äì0 down in just under 12 minutes, with both goals scored by a schoolteacher called John Petersen. Sportscene presenter Dougie Donnelly described the game at half-time as \\"perhaps the worst Scotland performance he had the displeasure of watching\\". Goals by Paul Lambert and Barry Ferguson salvaged a 2‚Äì2 draw for Scotland, but the damage had been done and Scotland were ridiculed by fans and media alike. David Weir retired from international football after being criticised by Vogts for his poor performance. Vogts also criticised Christian Dailly, but he decided to play on. The Faroes disaster was still lingering in the minds of fans but Scotland would go on to finish second in their group to Germany to secure a play-off position for qualification for UEFA Euro 2004. They defeated the Faroes in the return match, defeated Iceland home and away and drew with Germany at home. The team beat Lithuania 1‚Äì0 in the final match of the group with a goal by Darren Fletcher to qualify for a play‚Äìoff against Holland. Scotland beat the Dutch 1‚Äì0 at Hampden Park, thanks to a deflected goal by James McFadden, which raised hopes of qualification. These were crushed days later in the return match when a 6‚Äì0 thrashing, one of Scotland's heaviest ever defeats at the Amsterdam Arena gave the Dutch a 6‚Äì1 win on aggregate. Ruud van Nistelrooy scored a hat-trick as Scotland were swept aside. Vogts received further criticism after Scotland were beaten 4‚Äì0 by Wales in a friendly match at the Millennium Stadium. Scotland lost two further friendlies against Romania and Denmark, but they did pick up wins over Estonia and Trinidad and Tobago at the end of the season. In preparation for the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign Scotland lost 3‚Äì0 to Hungary in a friendly match at Hampden Park, before a creditable performance against Spain saw a match that was being drawn 1‚Äì1 when it was abandoned due to the floodlights failing. Scotland's opening qualifier against Slovenia finished in a goalless draw. Scotland then lost 1‚Äì0 to Norway at Hampden, their first home competitive defeat in 17 years. Days later Scotland drew 1‚Äì1 away to Moldova, where Vogts and some of his players were subject to verbal abuse by the Tartan Army. In October 2004 Vogts announced his resignation, blaming the media for his departure. Vogts did introduce a number of young players to the Scotland team, including Craig Gordon, Darren Fletcher and James McFadden. He was, however, heavily criticised by the media for his \\"scattergun\\" approach to selection, naive tactics and taking Scotland to an all-time low in the FIFA rankings. Vogts' assistant Tommy Burns took charge of a 4‚Äì1 friendly defeat against Sweden at Easter Road. The Berti Vogts era in Scottish Football is looked back by many people as the worst period in Scotland's history but was not helped by a considerable lack of international-quality players available to him during his reign. Vogts handed out an astonishing 40 debutants, trying to rebuild the side. =Walter Smith= David Taylor appointed Walter Smith and Ally McCoist as the new management team in December 2004. Smith convinced David Weir, who had played for Smith at Everton, to come out of international retirement. Smith's first game in charge was against Italy at the San Siro in March 2005, which Scotland lost 2‚Äì0 through two free kicks by Andrea Pirlo. In June 2005, Scotland beat Moldova 2‚Äì0 and drew 0‚Äì0 in Belarus. In the following season, Scotland achieved creditable results with a 1‚Äì1 draw at home to Italy and a 2‚Äì1 win in Norway. A surprise 1‚Äì0 defeat against Belarus ended their chances of qualifying, but the team ended the campaign on a high by winning 3‚Äì0 in Slovenia. Scotland played two low-key friendlies before a squad that was well below full strength went to Japan in May 2006 to take part in the Kirin Cup. Scotland beat Bulgaria 5‚Äì1 with debutants Chris Burke and Kris Boyd scoring two goals each. Scotland then kept out the hosts Japan to secure a goalless draw that won the trophy. The results under Smith had given the country hope, but Scotland were given \\"one of the hardest groups\\" for UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying as they were entered into Group B with France, Italy and Ukraine. The extraordinary difficulty of the group was confirmed when Ukraine reached the quarter-final of the 2006 World Cup, while France and Italy contested the final itself (which Italy won on penalties). Scotland at least got off to a good start in the group by winning 6‚Äì0 at Celtic Park against the Faroe Islands. and 2-1 in Lithuania. Scotland then recorded a famous 1‚Äì0 victory against France at Hampden on 7 October 2006, with Gary Caldwell scoring the only goal in the 67th minute. The next match in Kiev against Ukraine ended in a 2‚Äì0 defeat, with Steven Pressley sent off. The defeat by Ukraine proved to be Walter Smith's final match in charge, as he returned to former club Rangers. This left Scotland managerless with just over two months until the next matches against Georgia and Italy. Former Rangers manager Alex McLeish was hotly tipped and supported by Alex Ferguson to become the new manager, although long-term Scotland assistant manager Tommy Burns was also thought to be in the running. McLeish was appointed while Burns was not interviewed, which caused Burns to resign from his position. =Alex McLeish= Alex McLeish was appointed Scotland manager on 29 January 2007, and he hired Roy Aitken and Andy Watson as his assistants. McLeish's first match in charge was a UEFA Euro 2008 qualifier against Georgia in March 2007. In the 11th minute Kris Boyd scored to put Scotland in front. Georgia equalised just before half time with a goal from former Rangers striker Shota Arveladze, but a late winner by Craig Beattie gave Scotland a 2‚Äì1 win, and meant they 'held' the unofficial world champion title for the first time since 1967. Four days later Scotland went down 2‚Äì0 to the 2006 FIFA World Cup winners Italy in Bari. Scotland continued their progress with wins over the Faroe Islands and Lithuania. Scotland then produced a stunning 1‚Äì0 victory over France in Paris, thanks to a long-range strike by James McFadden. They consolidated their position at the top of the qualifying group with a convincing 3‚Äì1 win against Ukraine, but a 2‚Äì0 defeat in Georgia severely damaged the position. Instead of potentially just needing a draw from the final game at home to Italy to qualify, Scotland needed to win as a draw would leave them depending on other results. Italy took an early lead and had chances to knock Scotland out early, but the team battled back with an equalising goal by Barry Ferguson. Scotland then created chances to win the game, with James McFadden missing the best of them with just 10 minutes remaining. As Scotland pressed in search of a winning goal, the Italians were controversially awarded a free kick in injury time that led to a winning goal for Italy. After narrowly failing to qualify for Euro 2008, McLeish resigned to take the manager's job at Birmingham City. =George Burley= Scotland's improved results in the last two campaigns meant the team were seeded second for 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying, and they were drawn with the Netherlands, Norway, Macedonia and Iceland. Southampton manager George Burley was hired as the new manager, but the team failed to win three preparatory friendlies against Croatia, Czech Republic and Northern Ireland. Burley came in for criticism from the media after the team lost their first qualifier against Macedonia, but they recovered to win 2-1 in Iceland. The next match was a goalless draw at home against Norway, during which debutant Chris Iwelumo missed an open goal from three yards. Scotland lost their fourth match 3-0 away to the Netherlands. captain Barry Ferguson and goalkeeper Allan McGregor, who had both played in that match, were dropped for the following match against Iceland due to a \\"breach of discipline\\". George Burley made five changes in all for the match, which ended in a 2-1 win for Scotland, with Ross McCormack and Steven Fletcher both scoring on their competitive home debuts. A terrible 4-0 defeat by Norway in the following qualifier, however, left Scotland effectively needing to win their last two games to have a realistic chance of making the qualifying play-offs. Scotland defeated Macedonia 2-0 in the first of those two games at Hampden, but were eliminated by a 1-0 loss to the Netherlands in the second game. Nonetheless, Burley was allowed to continue in his post after a review by the SFA board. Soon afterwards, joint assistant coach Steven Pressley stood down from his role to concentrate on his commitments with Falkirk. Speaking after the campaign, Kenny Miller criticised the fixture schedule that had been agreed for the group, describing it as a \\"shambles\\". Burley came under further pressure after a 3-0 friendly defeat by Wales, as he conceded that it was a \\"very poor\\" performance, while the Tartan Army \\"showed their disgruntlement with Burley and the SFA\\" during the match. The SFA sacked Burley on 16 November 2009. 2010s =Craig Levein= The SFA appointed Craig Levein as Scotland manager in December 2009. In UEFA Euro 2012 qualification, Scotland were grouped with Lithuania, Liechtenstein, Czech Republic and world champions Spain. They took just four points from the first four games, leaving the team needing three wins from their remaining four games to have a realistic chance of progression. They only managed two wins and a draw and were eliminated after a 3‚Äì1 defeat by Spain in their last match. Levein left his position as head coach following a poor start to 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification, having taken just two points from four games. =Gordon Strachan= Gordon Strachan was appointed Scotland manager in January 2013, but defeats in his first two competitive matches meant that Scotland were the first UEFA team to be eliminated. In their next competitive game, however, Scotland produced a surprise away victory against a Croatia (ranked fourth by FIFA at the time). They also won the return match against Croatia and finished fourth in qualifying group A. In UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying, Scotland appeared to have a better chance of qualification as the finals tournament was expanded from 16 teams to 24, but were drawn in a tough group with Germany, Poland and Republic of Ireland. After losing their opening match in Germany, Scotland recorded home wins against Georgia, Ireland and Gibraltar, and away draws against Poland and Ireland. In their following game Scotland produced an \\"insipid\\" performance, as they lost 1-0 in Georgia. A home defeat by Germany left Scotland four points behind third-placed Ireland, with two games left to play. In the penultimate matches of the group, Scotland needed to beat Poland, or hope that Ireland would lose to Germany. Scotland came from behind to lead 2-1 in their game, but Ireland had scored the only goal of their game, leaving the Scots needing a win to stay alive. A late scrambled goal by Robert Lewandowski gave Poland a draw that eliminated Scotland from contention. Strachan bemoaned what he perceived to be bad luck. After a win against Gibraltar in the last qualifier, Strachan agreed a new contract with the Scottish Football Association. In qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Scotland were drawn in the same group as England, facing their rivals in a competitive fixture for the first time since 1999. On 11 November 2016, England beat Scotland 3‚Äì0 at Wembley. The return match saw Leigh Griffiths score two late free-kicks to give Scotland a 2‚Äì1 lead, but Harry Kane scored in added time to force a 2‚Äì2 draw. A draw in Slovenia in the final game of the group ended Scottish hopes of a play-off position, and Strachan subsequently left his position by mutual consent. =Alex McLeish= In February 2018, Alex McLeish was appointed manager for the second time. The team won their group in the 2018‚Äì19 UEFA Nations League, guaranteeing a play-off position for UEFA Euro 2020, but McLeish left in April 2019. This followed a 3‚Äì0 loss to 117th-ranked Kazakhstan in the first match of the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying group. 2020s =Steve Clarke= Steve Clarke was appointed Scotland manager in May 2019. The team failed to qualify automatically for UEFA Euro 2020, finishing a distant third behind Belgium and Russia. A victory on penalties, in Scotland's first ever shootout, against Israel put Scotland into a playoff final against Serbia.

It was built during the 1930s to conduct flying training. The airfield was turned over to the British Army in 1971 and is now known as the Duke of Gloucester Barracks. History Construction of the airfield began in 1936 and it was still underway when it opened on 16 August 1937. No. 3 Flying Training School was the initial tenant and was equipped with a variety of biplane aircraft which were replaced by Airspeed Oxfords in mid-1938. When the Second World War began in August 1939, the school was redesignated as a Service Flying Training School (SFTS) and was equipped with 44 Oxfords and 31 Hawker Harts. Shortly afterwards the headquarters of No. 23 Group RAF, responsible for advanced flying training, was transferred to South Cerney with its communications flight. By the late summer of 1940, the Oxfords had replaced all of the Harts and the school was dedicated to multi-engine training.Berryman, pp. 276‚Äì77 No. 15 Service Flying Training School RAF was transferred to the base in early June 1940 with its Oxfords and North American Harvard trainers, but it moved to RAF Kidlington at the end of August.

It now had responsibility for the Balkans and operational control over forces in Syria and Palestine. The Army included two inspectorates, the Second in the Balkans and the Fifth in Syria. The Army at the start of the First Balkan War in 1912 was structured as such:Edward J.

Erickson, Defeat in Detail, The Ottoman Army in the Balkans, 1912‚Äì1913, (Westport, CT: Praeger, 2003), 53. When the war started, the Second Army became the Western Army, the equivalent of an Army Group. The troops in Syria were prevented by the Greek Navy from reinforcing the forces in the Balkans. After the war, the Second Army was reconstituted from those personnel who survived the destruction of the Western Army in the Balkans.Edward J. Erickson, Defeat in Detail, The Ottoman Army in the Balkans, 1912‚Äì1913, (Westport, CT: Praeger, 2003), 320. It was first sent to Konya, and later to Syria.  Order of battle, 1914  At the outset of World War I, the army headquarters was located in Aleppo Syria commanding two corps made up of two divisions. The Redif system had been done away with, and the plan was to have reserve soldiers fill out active units rather than constitute separate units. The commander in October 1914 was General Vehip Pasha. By November 1914, the Second Army was moved to Constantinople and commanded the V and VI Corps, each composed of three divisions.Edward J.

The plan was to have the Second Army attack in conjunction with the Third Army. The Second Army was made up of veterans of the Gallipoli campaign as well as two new divisions. Due to the poor state of the Ottoman rail network, it took a long period of time to move the forces. In the meantime the Russians hit the Third Army, causing heavy casualties on that already battered army, preventing it from cooperating with the Second Army. The Second Army, commanded by Ahmet Izzet Pasha, finally attacked in August with the following divisions:Edward J.

While the XVI Corps commanded by Mustafa Kemal had success at Bitlis and Mus, the main attacks by the III and IV Corps suffered heavy losses. The Army lost about 30,000 out of 100,000 soldiers. The divisions suffering the losses were both veteran units and the best of the newly created divisions. The Ottoman Army could not afford to lose such men for meaningless gains. As a result, the offensive was a major strategic defeat.Edward J. Erickson, Ordered to Die, A History of the Ottoman Army in the First World War, (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2001), 133. It was the last major strategic offensive by the Ottomans in the war. In response to defeats elsewhere, the army had a number of divisions transferred to other areas such as Mesopotamia and Palestine. By December 1916, it was made up of six infantry divisions and one cavalry division.Edward J. Erickson, Ordered to Die, A History of the Ottoman Army in the First World War, (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2001), 137. The army did not play a major role in the war after that.  Order of battle, 1917  In 1917, Mustafa Kemal promoted to be the acting commander of the Second Army. His tenure was brief as he moved on to command the Seventh Army in Palestine. The army was deactivated in on 4 February 1918.Edward J. Erickson, Ordered to Die, A History of the Ottoman Army in the First World War, (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2001), 180.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed April 18, 2011 estuary linked to a coastal river system in St. Lucie and Martin counties in the Florida, United States. The St. Lucie River and St. Lucie Estuary are an \\"ecological jewel\\" of the Treasure Coast, central to the health and well-being of the surrounding communities. The river is part of the larger Indian River Lagoon system, the most diverse estuarine environment in North America with more than 4,000 plant and animal species, including manatees, oysters, dolphins, sea turtles and seahorses. Historically, the St. Lucie was a freshwater river with no connection to either the Atlantic Ocean or Lake Okeechobee. Beginning in the late 19th century, the river and its watershed underwent a series of modifications for navigation, flood control and water supply purposes.  Location  The North Fork of the St. Lucie River flows south from St Lucie County into Martin County where it joins the north-flowing South Fork, which was once called the Halpatiokee River, just south of the old Roosevelt Bridge (Old Dixie Highway) in Stuart to form the main St. Lucie River. It then passes under the Florida East Coast Railway drawbridge and the new high-level Roosevelt Bridge (U.S. Route 1) and flows east with Rio on the north side and Stuart on the south until it reaches the northern end of the Sewall's Point peninsula, where it runs south under the Evans Crary Bridge to the end of Sewall's Point, where it flows into the Indian River Lagoon directly west of the St. Lucie Inlet which goes into the Atlantic Ocean. The entire river is accessible to Lake Okeechobee by the Okeechobee Waterway. The main river passes through Sewall's Point, Port Salerno, Stuart, and Jensen Beach. The South Fork passes through Palm City. Although brackish for most of its length, the salt content of the South Fork diminishes considerably south of the Kanner Highway bridge. The headwaters of the South Fork are located in ranchland and scrub forest, primarily to the east of I-95 and northwest of Hobe Sound. The North Fork passes through Port Saint Lucie and White City. A Club Med resort lies on the eastern shore of the North Fork of the river at Greenridge Point. The North Fork is brackish along most of its length, but takes on the character of a fresh-water creek from White City northward. The headwaters of the North Fork are in the farmlands of St. Lucie County near Interstate 95 at an elevation of above sea level. Discharges In 2016, 237 billion gallons of water was discharged into the St. Lucie River from Lake Okeechobee by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers between January and November. In 2013, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dumped 137 billion gallons of water into the St. Lucie River from Lake Okeechobee. The USACE noted they \\"do share the concern about the quality of the water being released\\" but also noted that poor water quality was the state's fault in a release called \\"setting the record straight.\\" Environmental concerns Historic modifications to St. Lucie River, most notably digging of the Okeechobee Waterway (C-44 Navigational Canal), connections with the C-24 and C-23 drainage canals, and the associated water control structures, have had impacted water quality throughout the river basin. Intermittent freshwater discharges from Lake Okeechobee have negatively affected the river itself and the connected Indian River Lagoon. The impact takes several forms. First, this water tends to be rich in nutrients as a result of agricultural runoff, and thus has a tendency to cause algae blooms and other imbalances. Second, it contains pollutants found in street runoff and other urban sources, which are carried south by the Kissimmee River from the southern Orlando suburbs into Lake Okeechobee. Third, it is a source of turbidity and particulates that settle along the river bottom as a layer of muck. Fourth, the freshwater brings in high levels of humid substances that limit how far below the surface light can reach, affecting plant and animal life. Finally, the discharges radically reduce salinity levels, making the river temporarily uninhabitable by fauna and flora that are intolerant to fresh water. In 2013, heavy rains in southern Florida resulted in high runoff into the lake; rising lake levels forced the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to release large volumes of polluted water from the lake through the St. Lucie River estuary to the east and the Caloosahatchee River estuary to the west. Thus the normal mix of fresh and salt water in those estuaries was replaced by a flood of polluted fresh water resulting in ecological damage. = Algae blooms = Flyer posted by Martin County's Martin Memorial Hospital warning residents about the 2016 algae blooms. Harmful algal blooms have been documented in the St. Lucie River since the early 1980s.Havens, K.E., Hanlon, Charles, and James, R.T., 1995a, Historical trends in the Lake Okeechobee ecosystem, V. Algal blooms: Archiv fur Hydrobiolgie, Supplement 107, p. 89-100. These blooms occur as the result of nutrient pollution and degraded water quality, and their growth is further stimulated by high temperatures. In 2016, the river experienced the flourishing of extensive algae blooms, along with Lake Okeechobee and the Caloosahatchee River. The cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae, causes numerous severe health consequences for the marine ecosystem as well surrounding human populations. Blooms result in reduced dissolved oxygen concentrations, alterations in aquatic food webs, algal scum lining the shores, the production of compounds that cause distasteful drinking water and fish flesh, and the production of toxins severe enough to poison aquatic as well as terrestrial organisms. Blooms have been reported throughout the continental United States, and resulting cyanotoxins have been associated with human and animal illness and death in at least 43 states.Hudnell, H.K., ed., 2008, Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms‚Äì State of the science and research needs: Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology, v. 619, 950 p. Most cyanobacteria produce the neurotoxin beta-N-methylamino-l-alanine (BMAA) that has been implicated as a significant environmental risk in the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). The cyanobacteria has also been linked to liver cancer, chronic fatigue illness, skin rashes, abdominal cramps, nausea, diarrhea and vomiting. = Metal contamination = The ecosystem has proven to be contaminated with metals, especially benthic organisms. In 2014, it was determined that 86% of the river's amphipods and hard-shell clams contained copper and zinc concentrations higher than the threshold effect concentrations for Florida sediment quality criteria and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Screening Quick Reference Tables (SQuiRTs) sediment values.  Strategies for improvement  The South Florida Water Management District and its partners have put together various projects with the intention of improving the river and estuary: The St. Lucie River Watershed Protection Plan, CERP: Indian River Lagoon South (includes the C-44 Reservoir), CERP: Lake Okeechobee Watershed, Central Everglades Planning Project, Water Storage Strategies, Basin Management Action Plan, Herbert Hoover Dike Rehabilitation, Kissimmee River Restoration and Kissimmee Basin Modeling and Operations Study. =St. Lucie River Watershed Protection Plan= According to the South Florida Water Management District, this plan will address pollutant load reductions based on adopted total maximum daily loads (TMDLs). It will also include a goal for salinity levels and freshwater inflow targets for the St. Lucie Estuary.  List of crossings  This is the list of bridges crossing the river, starting with the North Fork, then going down the main river, and then jumping back to where the South Fork joins the North Fork to form the main river and going south up the South Fork. { style=\\"border-style:solid;border- width:1px;border-color:#808080;background-color:#EFEFEF\\" cellspacing=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" width=\\"100%\\" - bgcolor=\\"#EFEFEF\\" !

Emerson points on the book Die Berlinerin by Ashkan Sahihi (on the right), where - among others - Ms. Emerson (center) is pictured (2015). Ashkan Sahihi (born November 27, 1963) is an Iranian-American photographer known for his unique photographic series as well as for numerous portraits of important public figures. Life and work Born in Tehran, Iran, Ashkan Sahihi moved with his family to West Germany at the age of seven. Although he began taking photographs as a teenager, Sahihi traces the beginning of his professional trajectory to New York in 1987, a thriving ‚Äúpop culture metropolis‚Äù where he could do the kind of photography work that he wanted to do, exploring the underbelly of the society around him. Taking assignments from German publications such as the ZEITmagazin and S√ºddeutsche Zeitung Magazin, Spiegel, DUMMY and Spex, he photographed subjects like prisoners on death row, players in the hip-hop scene, and the downtown art scene of New York. Neither black nor white, an insider among outsiders, he found himself able to navigate spaces and dynamics that others might have had difficulty entering. He considered this both a privilege and an obligation ‚Äì to visit these places and tell these stories. His success led to commissions from American publications as well, including The New York Times Magazine, The New Yorker, Vice, Rolling Stone, and Vogue. Put off by the limitations of photojournalism (the expectation that he would illustrate the writer‚Äôs perspective rather than author a narrative of his own), Sahihi began to embark on independent, highly compact conceptual series. In the early 2000s, Sahihi has lived and worked in New York, Istanbul, and London, producing bodies of work in each place that attempt to engage the political discourse he deems lacking in substance. Amongst others, he contributed to Istanbul Contrasts und Art and Patronage, both published by Thames & Hudson. In 2011 he followed and documented New Yorks Occupy Wall Street movement. After moving to Berlin in 2013, he started working on a large scale photo-sociological study dedicated to the cities women and two other series that subsequently were also published as books. He also had his work exhibited several times in Berlin, most recently at the Weserhalle Gallery. In March 2020, Sahihi photographed American Drag Queen, performance artist and musician Christeene for German Interview magazine. A large-scale retrospective of the photojournalistic work was published by DISTANZ in September 2020. The New York Years is a collection of 224 portraits shot in New York since the late 1980s, showing musicians such as David Bowie, 50 Cent, Solange Knowles and Nick Cave, writers John Irving, Siri Hustvedt and Irvine Welsh, actors Willem Dafoe and John Lurie, as well as artists such as Jeff Koons, Louise Bourgeois, Cindy Sherman and Nam-June Paik or galerist and collector Bruno Bischofberger. A selection of about 40 portraits will be on display at McLaughlin Berlin in autumn 2020.  Photographic Series  In his conceptual works, Sahihis main goal has been to drive forward public discourse on topics he believes have not provoked enough or the right kind of discussion: drugs, gender in the media, women in the military, etc. In his portraits, Sahihi often draws on familiar visual languages yet using them in contexts they are supposedly not suited for, thus pushing the viewer to feel and think about entirely new things. Whilst constantly challenging the comfort level of both the viewer and the subject, Sahihi never removes himself from the line of fire; all of his work requires the artist to immerse himself in uncomfortable situations and challenge his own emotional fortitude. In the Face Series (18 images), latex-gloved hands manipulate the subjects‚Äô features, stretching, pushing, squeezing, pinching at the whim of external direction ‚Äì from the artist? The customer? The public? The Hypnosis Series comprises 8 portraits of hypnotized subjects each experiencing a single emotion, e. g. helplessness, withholding/anger, or regret. In a society that rewards the suppression of such naked emotion, the purity of these depictions is arresting. In 2006, Sahihi photographed himself in the homes and with the families of six ex-girlfriends and one ex-wife, imposing himself more or less awkwardly on the constellations that emerged after he had exited their lives. The Exes Series has been published in several magazines. For the most well-known of his early conceptual works, the Drug Series, he convinced 11 non‚Äìdrug users to consume a particular drug, then took their portraits over the course of their trips. The series was born out of Sahihi‚Äôs frustration with the hypocrisy of the political conversation about drugs in the United States. ‚ÄúBy attempting to present an objective image of drug use, the artist addresses the cultural politics that allow our society to simultaneously glamorize the ‚Äòdrug look‚Äô in fashion magazines and the entertainment industry and meanwhile turn a blind eye to the complicated, and vast, problem of drug abuse.‚Äù Sahihi has exhibited this series at MoMA PS1 in New York City in 2001, the Berlin Academy of the Arts in 2005, and alongside his installation 100 Million in Ready Cash. Sahihi‚Äôs dense explorations through small photographic series include Women of the IDF, portraits of female Israeli soldiers; Camp X-Ray Guantanamo Bay, black-and-white landscapes of barbed wire and watch towers; the Cum Series that references US corporate IDs and yearbook photography to comment on the pornografization of everyday culture without catering to it himself; the Armpit Series; and the Kiss Series, in which the artist photographed himself kissing 18 women and men of various ethnicities. Sahihi‚Äôs most extensive work to date is the study Die Berlinerin, inspired by Clifford Geertz‚Äô method of Thick description. Using search categories based on age, profession, life plan, social background, etc. he made contact with a wide variety of women living temporarily or permanently in Berlin. Meeting them in settings chosen by the models themselves, Sahihi created a series of 375 portraits that was on display alongside corresponding questionnaires in the Galerie im K√∂rnerpark and Springer Gallery in autumn and winter 2015/2016. The complete series was published by DISTANZ. Living in Berlin since 2013, ‚Äúhe encountered young, gay men that struck him as oddly familiar. They reminded him of New York in the 1980s, and of the search for new forms of identity. It seemed as if Berlin of the 2010s had replaced the old New York as the city of dreams.‚Äù Remembering the old New York, a city marked by creativity and freedom but also hit by the HIV/AIDS epidemic that diminished ‚Äúthe creative community by what seemed like half of its most brilliant talents and ravaging its creative power,‚Äù Sahihi created a series of nude photographs of the Beautiful Berlin Boys. The book and accompanying exhibition at Galerie Kehrer are paying tribute to both old friends and Berlins thriving gay and queer community. The fascination with Barbara Hepworth's Hospital Drawings he shares with sports surgeon Hanno Steckel led to another series published by Kehrer. Sahihis black and white photographs follow Steckel into The Operating Theatre, capturing the rhythmic play of hands and movements, thus tracing the similarities between artistic and surgical craftsmanship. In May 2019, Sahihi reenacted Leonardo da Vincis famous Last Supper with friends and neighbors from Neuk√∂llns Weserstra√üe neighborhood. On display in the Galerie Weserhalle, the large scale work touches on the comandment to love one‚Äôs neighbor as well as on topics of greed and betrayal.

Built in 1925, the Fillmore Detroit was known for most of its history as the State Theatre. It is located near the larger Fox Theatre in the Detroit Theatre District along Woodward Avenue across from Comerica Park and Grand Circus Park. The Fillmore Detroit features a theatre with a Grand Lobby and three levels of seating, as well as the State Bar & Grill which has a separate entrance and is open when the theatre is not hosting events. The Detroit Music Awards are held annually at The Fillmore Detroit in April. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. History The site of the Fillmore was previously home to an earlier theatre known as the Central and then, from 1913-1923, as the Grand Circus Theatre. This theatre was demolished to make way for the 1925 construction of what was then called the Francis Palms Building. The building was named for Francis Palms, a Belgian native who moved to Detroit in 1832 and made his fortune in real estate development.State Theatre/ Francis Palms Building from Detroit1701 Palms' descendants continued in real estate as the Palms Realty Company, and constructed this building at a time when Detroit's population and the popularity of movies was booming. The theatre was constructed in 1925 as a movie house in the Renaissance Revival style of architecture. C. Howard Crane was the original architect, and the building is still called the Francis Palms Building. The theatre was originally called the State Theatre when it opened in 1925. It was renamed the Palms Theatre in 1937. In 1982 it was renamed back to the State Theatre. And in 2007 (as a national re-branding) it was renamed, this time the Fillmore Theatre. The building is twelve stories high and covered with terra cotta, with an eight-story auditorium extending to the rear of the building.Palms, Francis, Building and State Theater from the state of Michigan The office tower has elaborate Beaux-Arts Italian Renaissance decorations on all but the ground floor, which was modernized in about 1960. Current use The Fillmore Detroit is a concert venue for popular music acts as well as hosting many special events. The venue's current seating capacity is 2,900, 2,084 for reserved seating. The mezzanine and balcony levels still contain their original theatre seating. In March 2007, Live Nation announced that the State Theatre would become the Fillmore Detroit as part of a multi- city extension of the Fillmore brand, similar to what has been done previously with the House of Blues franchise. Various changes were implemented to evoke the Fillmore's iconic venue in San Francisco, California. The official inaugural show under the Fillmore Detroit re-branding was Fergie's June 13, 2007 performance. Live Nation has continued the gradual restoration of the Italian Renaissance theatre. The outer lobby and rotunda lobby were restored in the 1990s. The grand foyer columns and auditorium proscenium arch were more recent restorations. Live Nation has restored the barrel vaulted ceiling of the three story grand foyer, and has plans to work on the upper reaches of the auditorium in increments.

Toy (born April 29, 1930 in New York City) is a long-time LGBT activist, considered a pioneer among LGBT activists in Michigan. Toy earned his B.A. at Denison University in 1951. He graduated with a master's degree in Clinical Social Work from the University of Michigan and served as a pro bono counselor and therapist. Toy underwent bureaucratic retirement in 2008 from the University of Michigan as the diversity coordinator in the Office of Institutional Equity. He was awarded the Alumni Citation, Denison's highest alumni honor, in June 2001, and was featured as an early LGBT alumnus in an article on the college's LGBTQ history in 2013. Michigan activism Jim Toy identified as being gay during his speech at an anti-Vietnam-War rally in Kennedy Square, Detroit, in April 1970. At the rally, Toy was representing the Detroit Gay Liberation Front, of which he was a founding member. =Ann Arbor / University of Michigan= He was as well a founding member of the Ann Arbor Gay Liberation Front. In 1971, he helped establish the Human Sexuality Office (HSO) at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The HSO was the first staffed office at an institution of higher learning in the United States, and presumably the first of its kind in the world, to address and support sexual minorities. Jim served as its Co-Coordinator, and Gay Male advocate, from 1971 until 1994. The HSO, now named the Spectrum Center, has named its library in Jim's honor. The Jim Toy Library (JTL) currently hosts a collection of over 1500 titles and supports LGBTQA student development by exposing students to, and engaging them in, the rich cultural, social, historical, psychological, political, and relational aspects of LGBTQ people, identities, experiences, and communities. In 1972, Toy co-authored the first official \\"Lesbian-Gay Pride Week Proclamation\\" by a U.S. governing body, the Ann Arbor City Council. The same year, he co-authored the city's non- discrimination policy on sexual orientation. He participated (1973‚Äì1993) in the successful efforts to amend the University of Michigan's non- discrimination bylaw to include sexual orientation as a protected category. He engaged in the campaigns to create and retain the City of Ypsilanti's non- discrimination ordinance (1997‚Äì1998). In 1999, Jim and Dr. Sandra Cole, former Director of Michigan Medicine's Comprehensive Gender Services Program, wrote the language of Ann Arbor's non-discrimination policy regarding gender identity. With many others, Jim advocated successfully (1993‚Äì2007) for the amendment of the University of Michigan's non-discrimination bylaw so as to include gender identity and gender expression as protected categories. =Episcopal Diocese of Michigan= In 1971, Bishop Richard Emrich of the Episcopal Diocese of Michigan appointed Jim a founding member of the Diocesan Commission on Homosexuality. The group published the Report & Recommendations of the Commission on Homosexuality (1973), one of the earliest church documents in this country to support the concerns of lesbigay people. Since 1975, Jim has served as the Secretary of the Diocesan Church & Society Committee. He was a co-author of the Diocesan Human Sexuality Curriculum and was Secretary of the Diocesan Committee on Transgender/Bisexual/Lesbian/Gay/Concerns. He is a founding Board member of the Oasis TBLG Outreach Ministry of the Diocese and currently serves as the secretary. On Sunday, October 27, 2019, he was seated as Canon Honorary at the Cathedral Church of St. Paul, Detroit, at an Evensong for the Feast of Saints Simon and Jude. =LGBT health and wellness= He co-founded the Ann Arbor Gay Hotline in 1972 and served as its Coordinator and Trainer until 1985. In 1986, Jim helped found the Wellness Networks/Huron Valley, now known as Unified: HIV Health and Beyond. He became the first Co-Coordinator of HIV/AIDS Education for the Episcopal Diocese of Michigan in 1987. He has served as a certified Pre- & Post-Test HIV/AIDS Counselor and as a support group facilitator and volunteer trainer for Unified: HIV Health and Beyond. He is a founding member of the City of Ann Arbor HIV/AIDS Task Force and of two four-county HIV/AIDS prevention and resource-provision groups. =Additional organizations= He was a founding member of the Washtenaw County LGBT Retirement Center Task Force, PFLAG/Ann Arbor, GLSEN/Ann Arbor-Ypsilanti Area, Washtenaw Rainbow Action Project (WRAP), Transgender Advocacy Project (TAP), American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) Inclusive Justice Program, Washtenaw Faith Action Network, Ypsilanti Human Rights PAC, Ypsilanti Rainbow Neighbors, and the Out Loud Chorus (1995). He was a former Executive Board member of Guild House (\\"A Campus Ministry\\"). He was a trained mediator and trainer for the American Friends Service Committee Inclusive Justice Program's non-violent-dialogue training (\\"LARA\\"). He was a member of the Program Committee of the AFSC Michigan's Inclusive Justice Program. He served on Equality Michigan's Board of Advisors.tri.org and the WikiQueer Global Advisory Board. He was a founding member of the gay Baroque trio, Rosetta Stoned, & The Higheroglyphics. Acknowledgements The Washtenaw Rainbow Action Project (WRAP) is a local Ann Arbor resource center that exists to provide information, education, social events, and advocacy by and for the Queer and Ally community in the Washtenaw County area. The center was renamed the Jim Toy Community Center (JTCC) in 2010 to honor the local gay activist legend. His archives are housed in the James W.

Born in Carmel, Saskatchewan, Glover began his 46-year broadcasting career in the city near his home town, Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan at a 250 watt radio station (CHAB) for $5 a week. From there he moved on to Toronto in 1938 to be one of the six staff announcers at CBC. He would remain at the CBC for the next 35 years. In 1939, he covered the Royal tour of King George VI and was the CBC's chief announcer during World War II. Following the war, Glover was the host of At Ease with Elwood Glover, an afternoon drive show on CBC radio in the 1950s and 1960s. Elwood Glover's Luncheon Date, debuted on the radio in 1956, then was later moved to CBC television in 1963, where Glover interviewed thousands of guests on Luncheon Date over the next twelve years, including such great names as Ella Fitzgerald, Henry Fonda, Lorne Greene, Eartha Kitt, Christopher Plummer and Mel Torm√©. A clarinetist and one time bandleader, Glover used his programs to especially highlight Canadian talent. One such Canadian guest, Stompin' Tom Connors, was married on Glover's show in 1973. Fans and critics called Glover \\"Mr. Bland\\",\\" \\"Mr. Cool\\", \\"Mr. Nice Guy\\", or \\"Mr. Molasses\\". Glover took it in stride and said, \\"I'd like to be a more colourful person, but I haven't the makeup for it. I've got this label of a nice guy and it bores the hell out of me. But I hold myself back a little and let my guest shine out.\\" Glover then moved back to radio in 1975, working at radio stations CKEY (where for four years he was their most popular host), CKO and FM-108 in Burlington. A quadruple bypass in 1982 along with overall poor health forced Glover to retire in 1983. Glover died on November 14, 1990, leaving his wife, two daughters and five grandchildren.

Although the football competition was instituted in 1884, it was only the eighty-seventh tournament to be completed due to a five-year hiatus during World War I, a seven-year gap in World War II and the cancellation of the 1981 competition following threats of violence during The Troubles in Northern Ireland. The tournament was surprising in its outcome, as the favourites in England and Scotland played each other into a 1‚Äì1 draw in the final game, thus allowing Northern Ireland to claim victory on goal difference, with Wales second.

Life  Gagnon was born on November 22, 1931 in Fall River, Massachusetts. He became an undergraduate and graduate student at the University of Chicago in the 1950s gaining his BA in 1955 and his PhD in 1969. After working as assistant to the Sheriff of Cook County Jail, he became the Senior Research Sociologist and Trustee at the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana from 1959 to 1968. At the Kinsey Institute, Gagnon worked with his friend from his graduate student days at the University of Chicago, William Simon, and they started a short but highly productive collaboration. Their key work, Sexual Conduct (1973), was developed during this period. Kinsey had been dead a few years and there was a sense of 'winding down' at the Institute. Prior to the arrival of William Simon, Gagnon worked primarily on the Sex Offenders legacy project, the computerization of the original Kinsey sex histories and the maintenance of the Kinsey Archives and Library. After the arrival of Simon in 1965, in addition to the essays that made up Sexual Conduct, they started two major projects: a national study of sexual development among a national sample of college students and a major project on homosexuality. This was his induction into mainstream survey research, but it also set up a permanent tension in his work between conventional empirical research and the problem of theorizing sexuality adequately and taking seriously how social the sexual was. These ideas haunted him for the rest of his life. Subsequently, Gagnon's major academic post was to be held at the University of New York at Stony Brook between 1968‚Äì1998, where he became Distinguished Professor of sociology. During this time he chaired and sat on many committees and held many visiting positions at The Laboratory of Human Development at Harvard University; at Churchill College, Cambridge; at the University of Copenhagen; and at the Universities of Essex, Princeton and Chicago. He worked on many leading projects connected with sexuality including the President's Commission on Obscenity and Pornography; chaired the SSRC-Ford Foundation committee on Sexuality Fellowships; and was a member of the National Research Council‚Äôs CBASSE committee on the HIV-AIDS epidemic. In his retirement, he moved with his (second) wife, Cathy Greenblat, the sociologist and photographer, first to Nice and latterly to Palm Springs. Most recently he held a consultancy with the Laboratory of Robert Grant, Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology, San Francisco, California. Gagnon died on Thursday, February 11, 2016 from pancreatic cancer. Gagnon's autobiographical reflections on his life until 1973 can be found in Authors of Our Own Lives, edited by Bennett Berger (1990).  Ideas and contribution  Gagnon is seen as the founder of a distinctly sociological approach to human sexuality. Michael Kimmel has called it 'revolutionary' and in a book devoted to articles inspired by the work of Gagnon, he claims that the book Sexual Conduct (1973) 'heralded the new paradigm from which all subsequent readings of sexuality in the social science and humanities have sprung' (Kimmel, 2007:pix). Gayle Rubin has also commented that Gagnon and Simon ‚Äôvirtually reinvented sex research as social science‚Äô (Rubin, 2002: 28). Often linked to symbolic interactionism, but also tempered with Durkheim, his work has inspired and shaped a whole field variously called ‚Äòthe constructionist approach to sexuality‚Äô Social constructionism or ‚Äòcritical sexualities studies‚Äô. His ideas may also be seen as a precursor of ‚Äòqueer theory‚Äô Queer theory. He has briefly summarized his own work thus: (1) Sexual conduct is entirely historically and culturally determined; (2) the meaning of conduct does not reside in a reading of the bodily activity of individuals; (3) sexual science is historically and culturally determined in equal measure ;(4) sexuality is acquired, maintained, and unlearned in all of its aspects and is organized by social structure and culture, and (5) gender and sexuality are both learned forms of conduct and are linked differently in different cultures. (Interpretation of Desire 2004 p136). Gagnon‚Äôs contribution lies in four key fields. * First, he pioneered an account of human sexuality that was not to be driven by an overwhelming prominence being given to the biological. With Bill Simon, he rejected 'the unproven assumption that \\"powerful\\" psychosexual drives are fixed biological attributes. More importantly, we reject the even more dubious assumption that sexual capacities or experiences tend to translate immediately into a kind of universal \\"knowing\\" or innate wisdom ‚Äì that sexuality has a magical ability, possessed by no other capacity, that allows biological drives to be expressed directly in psychosocial and social behaviors.' (Psychosexual Development, 1969.) Much followed from this, as whole new field of analysis opened up. * Secondly, and above all, Gagnon inspired many to think critically and seriously about human sexuality as a theoretical problem. Although he worked alongside the sexological profession, he remained very sceptical about its basic assumptions. (With Bill Simon, he developed the sociological theorization of human sexualities. Many ideas were formulated here, but the key was the significance of scripts as a metaphor for understanding human sexualities. Human sexuality far from being a simple biological drive should be seen as a socially organized script. We see sexual behavior therefore as scripted behavior, not the masked expression of a primordial drive. Psycho-sexual development 1969. Gagnon and Simon then proceeded to investigate three layers of scripting: historical and cultural, interactive and interpersonal, as well as its intra-personal or intra-psychic dimensions. * Thirdly, having established a major social study of homosexuality at the Kinsey Institute, Gagnon challenged studies of 'homosexuality' to move away from the clinical and the pathological path, which dominated till the 1970s, towards the social and the political. ‚ÄúWe have allowed the homosexual‚Äôs object choice to dominate and control our imagery of him‚Äù Formulation, 1967. A new approach was established which investigated the social and cultural situation of the homosexual. This was a little before the emergence of the Gay Liberation Front and marker events of the Stonewall resistance to police harassment. * Finally, Gagnon was an early empirical investigator of the AIDS pandemic and his work helped shape an understanding of the role that different kinds of communities play in shaping the HIV and AIDS pandemic.  Honors  Gagnon was an NIMH Post Doctoral Fellow in 1972‚Äì3, was made a fellow of the Society for the Scientific Study of Sex and subsequently received the SSSS lifetime achievement award for research into sexuality in 1981 and was President of the International Academy of Sex Research 1987‚Äì8. He was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Letters in 2006 from the Glasgow Caledonian University. He has been on the board of many professional and scientific committees connected with the study of human sexual conduct including the Presidents Commission on Pornography. The Sexualities section of the American Sociological Association named its distinguished prize in sexualities studies as The John H Gagnon and William Simon award and it has been awarded annually since 2001.

History 19th-century view of the town The town is located at an Old Prussian settlement which received town rights in 1351 as \\"Schiffenburg\\", after the area was conquered by the Teutonic Knights. In 1372 the town was surrounded by a defensive wall with two entrance gates.Miasta polskie w TysiƒÖcleciu, tom II (in Polish), Zak≈Çad Narodowy imienia Ossoli≈Ñskich Wroc≈Çaw‚ÄìWarszawa‚ÄìKrak√≥w 1967, p. 144 In 1440 the town joined the Prussian Confederation, at which request in 1454 King Casimir IV Jagiellon signed the act of incorporation of the region to Poland. During the Thirteen Years‚Äô War (1454‚Äì1466), the town was successfully defended against the Teutonic Knights, until 1461. After the Second Peace of Toru≈Ñ of 1466 the town remained part of the Teutonic state, now a Polish fief. An important route connecting Warsaw and K√∂nigsberg (Kr√≥lewiec) ran through Schippenbeil, contributing to the town's prosperity. Former 19th-century memorial to J√≥zef Jan Giedroyƒá In 1710 about 50 percent of the population (800 inhabitants) died of the epidemic plague and the town was largely destroyed by a fire in 1749. As the town became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701, it was peripheral in the new state and wasn't able to rebuild itself and return to its former prosperity, because the trade traffic on the Warsaw-K√∂nigsberg route froze as the result of the end of Polish suzerainty over the town and the region north of the town to K√∂nigsberg. The 18th-century border of Poland ran in close proximity, south of the town. During the Napoleonic Wars, in 1806-1807, the Baroque town hall and the old granaries were burnt down. After the Polish November Uprising from September 1831 to February 1832, interned Polish officers and soldiers stayed in the town. The Polish officer J√≥zef Jan Giedroyƒá was awarded the Virtuti Militari (the highest Polish military decoration), soon died and was buried on a hill in the town, which was later called the Giedroyƒá Hill. The memorial monument was destroyed after some time. Between 1871 and 1945 the area was part of Germany (province of East Prussia). In the late 19th century the town was slowly declining. Local Jews, whose community existed since the beginning of the 19th century, were imprisoned by the Germans in the Stutthof concentration camp during World War II. Also, a subcamp of Stutthof concentration camp was operated near Schippenbeil, the inmates were evacuated in January 1945 and murdered in the Palmnicken massacre. In early February 1945, the Soviets entered the almost completely abandoned city, plundered it and destroyed it. After the war it became part of Poland. Architecture Among the heritage monuments of the city are the Gothic Saint Michael the Archangel Church, fragments of medieval city walls, an Art Nouveau water tower and a number of houses, the oldest dating back to the 15th century.

History and purpose HBFF was founded in 1998 by its executive director, Tanya Kersey, in order to enhance the careers of emerging and established black filmmakers through a public exhibition and competition program. The festival's goal is to play an integral role in discovering and launching independent films and filmmakers by bringing them to the attention of the industry, press and public. Format In addition to the film screenings, the adjunct Infotainment Conference features dozens of informational seminars, panels and workshops covering a wide variety of topics which range from film production, distribution and marketing to pitching, writing for television and film, in addition to specific programs of interest to actors. Each year, more than 100 top film and television executives, filmmakers, producers, directors, writers, agents, attorneys, business managers and actors participate in the talk-show style panels, roundtable discussions and workshops. A highlight of the Infotainment Conference is \\"A Conversation With‚Ä¶\\" a series of up-close-and- personal candid conversations with some of the industry's hottest movers and shakers. HBFF has been honored to have directors John Singleton (\\"2 Fast 2 Furious,\\" \\"Baby Boy,\\" \\"Shaft,\\" \\"Boyz N The Hood\\"), George Tillman (\\"Soul Food, Barbershop\\") and St. Clair Bourne (\\"The Life and Works of Gordon Parks,\\" \\"John Henrick Clarke: A Great and Mighty Walk\\") and scribe Tina Andrews (\\"Why Do Fools Fall in Love?\\") participate in these enlightening and informative discussions. The HBFF Pitchathon is for filmmakers and storytellers hoping to sell their idea, story, book or screenplay to Hollywood buyers. Participants get to pitch their story ideas to entertainment industry executives (film directors and producers, acquisitions, development, production and distribution executives), talent agents and greenlighters (people who make decisions on whether or not to \\"greenlight\\" a project) who will critique their concept/idea to examine its commercial potential in the today's film marketplace. Awards The juried HBFF Filmmaker & Storyteller Awards honor the achievements of the most promising black filmmakers and screenwriters. Films that screen during the festival compete for the following jury awards: Best Feature, Best Documentary, Best Short, Best Student Film, and the HBFF Audience Choice Award. A separate HBFF Storyteller Competition awards scribes for their excellence in screenwriting. Closing Night is highlighted by the announcement of the crowd-favorite HBFF Audience Choice Award, which is selected by audience vote.

Slow is known for his nu-jazz style and for his production of commercial music for high-profile advertising projects for TV and cinema. Career Inspiration from hip hop acts such as Run-DMC, Public Enemy and Eric B & Rakim, led Slow to begin a career in DJing, later making music and remixing other people's tracks. In the year 1990 Slow met fellow DJ JA-Jazz when they worked together in the music department of a department store. With money from his evening job, Slow bought a pair of Technics turntables and some records. He participated in the Finnish DMC Mixing Championships and won the contest four years in a row: in 1992, 1993, 1994 and 1995, using two Technics SL-1200 direct-drive turntables and a DJ mixer, with musical styles ranging from hip hop to funk and jazz. n 1995 Ja-Jazz introduced Slow to James Spectrum, and the three of them formed a band called Pepe Delux√©, playing a mixture of big beat, trip hop, and hip hop. The band's first release was a 1998 EP entitled Three Times a Player, which was chosen as Record of the Month by Muzik magazine. Pepe Delux√©'s first full-length album, Super Sound, was released in 1999 by UK's Catskills Records. Due to clearance problems with the samples, they had to produce a new version of the album with many of the tracks rerecorded with cleared samples or live instruments. The new version of the album was released in France, Italy, Spain, The Netherlands, the United States, Australia, and Germany. One track from the album, \\"Woman in Blue\\" (later renamed \\"Before You Leave\\"), was chosen to be used for a worldwide advertising campaign for Levi's jeans in 2001. During this time Pepe Deluxe were also asked to do remixes for artists including Tom Jones, The Cardigans, and Eminem. After a lot of promotion and concerts around the world, Slow left the group to pursue solo projects. Between 1999 and 2001 he worked as Head of A&R; at EMI Finland, launching a new dance label called Nozle, which released singles from dance acts such as Campaus, Z-MC, and Jori Hulkkonen's Step Time Orchestra. Campaus was a dance act Slow started with a Finnish producer Rauli Eskolin. In 2002 Slow formed SlowHill with Finnish saxophonist Tapani Rinne of the band RinneRadio. Fusing jazz sounds with electronic beats, their first album Finndisc was released on Blue Note Records. In the same year, DJ Slow's single \\"Got to Funk\\" reached #1 in the Finnish dance chart, and peaked at #19 on the Finnish singles chart. The track was originally made for Hartwall's Upcider drink commercial, but due to positive reception, was eventually released as a single. In 2003 Slow worked on various remixes such as The Crash's track \\"Star\\", and TV scores for Finnish television. In 2004 Slow released his debut album This Is Now, and began broadcasting a weekly radio show, Burner, on Helsinki's Groove FM with hip-hop artist Paleface. In 2005 SlowHill released their second album Fennika on Plastinka Records, and remixed BWO's \\"Sixteen Tons of Hardware\\". With Tapani Rinne, Slow also wrote the score for Finnish movie Koti-ik√§v√§, which was nominated for a Jussi Award. In 2006, Slow played a set at Midem International Music Market's 40th anniversary opening night in Cannes. He also released his second album Pronto!, and later that year the album was also released in Japan by Columbia Records. He also played at Wallpaper magazine's design awards in London, the Artek pavilion at Milan's furniture fair, and the Klara Festival in Brussels, and produced music for Nokia, IKEA, and Finlandia Vodka among others.

Its formation in 1965 was a result of the campaigning efforts of governmental planning agencies and Atlanta businessmen. The system broke ground on its rail system in 1975. Early history Map of the initial plan of the MARTA system from the 1970s The first mention of rapid transit for Atlanta occurred in a series of regional planning reports prepared by the Metropolitan Planning Commission (MPC) in 1950 and 1954. The 1950 report, named Up Ahead, and the 1954 report, named Now for Tomorrow, both primarily dealt with freeway planning, but both specifically mentioned the long-range need for rapid transit in Atlanta. The MPC began to study rapid transit further, and in two subsequent reports (Access to central Atlanta and Crosstown and bypass expressways) the MPC concluded that increased highway construction would not be adequate to meet future transportation needs. These recommendations were not welcomed by the Georgia Highway Department, who believed that highways were an adequate solution. Three reports were published in the early 1960s helped to give momentum to the push for rapid transit. Two reports were from the Atlanta Region Metropolitan Planning Commission (ARMPC): a 1960 report titled What you should know about rapid transit and a 1961 report titled Atlanta region comprehensive plan: rapid transit which called for of high speed rapid rail transport serving 5 counties at a cost of $200‚Äì215 million. These reports viewed transit as a means to shaping and planning the future of the Atlanta region, as well as maintaining Atlanta's role as a regional center in the southeast. The third report, titled Rapid Atlanta was published in 1960 by the Atlanta Transit System which proposed a $59 million first phase of a rapid transit system. This report received support in Atlanta's business community; in 1961 the president of the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, Ivan Allen, named a rapid transit steering committee, which included Robert L. Sommerville, president of the Atlanta Transit System (Atlanta's public busing system), and was headed by Richard Rich, a former Chamber president. This committee worked with the ARMPC to send speakers to civic organizations and business groups to discuss rapid transit. Also in 1961 Atlanta mayor William Hartsfield appointed a rapid transit committee which worked with the ARMPC to lobby members of the Georgia General Assembly to look favorably on rapid transit. In 1962 the lobbying efforts proved successful; the Georgia legislature created the Metropolitan Atlanta Transit Study Commission (MATSC). Formation of MARTA A person waiting at a MARTA bus stop, June 1974 A state constitutional amendment was required to establish a regional transportation agency. In November 1962 this amendment was approved by a majority of voters in DeKalb and Fulton counties but failed to pass statewide. The amendment did not specify the composition of the agency but stated in more general terms the nature of powers for the agency (taxing, eminent domain, expenditure of public funds) that would be designated by the state to a lower agency for the purposes of transit planning. As a result, many rural voters believed they were committing themselves to pay for a transit system in Atlanta. Opposition was also raised by the trucking industry in defense of highway funds. In December 1962 the MATSC published a report titled A Plan and Program of Rapid Transit for the Atlanta Metropolitan Region which called for a , 42 station rapid rail transit system with feeder buses and park-and-ride facilities across 5 counties centered upon downtown Atlanta. In March 1963 the MATSC formed a committee which came to be known as the Rapid Transit Committee of 100 for the purpose of financing and publicizing the rapid transit campaign as outlined in the December 1962 report. In the same year the MATSC was dissolved by the state and replaced by a new organization called the Georgia State Study Commission. The Study Commission reviewed and approved the previous MATSC transit plan. The continued campaigning by regional and local groups led to the passing of a second transit-enabling state constitutional amendment in 1964. This second amendment however was not proposed statewide but was placed only on the ballots of five metropolitan Atlanta counties (Fulton, Cobb, Gwinnett, DeKalb, and Clayton). Approval was slim in Cobb county where the margin was only 403 votes. The 1965 Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority ActMetropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority Act was authored by State Senator Ben F. Johnson of DeKalb County. In March of that year it was passed by the Georgia legislature setting up a rapid transit agency but required ratification by the five counties. In June 1965 voters in four of the five counties approved the creation of MARTA; only 43 percent of voters approved MARTA in Cobb County. MARTA was officially formed in January 1966. 1968 referendum MARTA began work on developing a new 4 county rapid transit plan. In 1967 the agency published a new plan, titled Special Report - Rapid Transit for Metropolitan Atlanta, a rapid transit rail system, at a cost of $190 million more than the previous MATSC plan. Fears about the cost of the plan were published in a counter-proposal by Robert Somerville of the Atlanta Transit System, titled Rapid Busways, challenging the MARTA plan. Rapid Busways called for the creation of a network of busways at a cost of $52 million as an interim plan to Atlanta's transit needs. MARTA consultants worked to update the original MATSC plan into a smaller rapid rail system, however this report was not published until September 1968. In November 1968 a Fulton County, DeKalb County, and city of Atlanta referendum allowing MARTA to move into capital programs failed to pass, receiving only 44.5 percent voter support. The failure of the funding referendum to pass has been attributed to many reasons: *The continuing controversy over the use of rail transport over busway transit *The decision of local transit unions to campaign against the referendum because it did not contain collective bargaining provisions *Conservatives claimed that the plan was financially irresponsible since Federal government financial support was not guaranteed *Low income and suburban homeowners objected to the use of property tax to fund MARTA *Voters on the edge of the system objected because they felt that residents of the city of Atlanta would receive more benefits *Atlanta's black community complained it had not been involved in the planning and would not receive adequate service *Local officials in the region were not involved in planning *Publicity of the plan by MARTA was poor 1971 referendum As a result of the 1968 referendum failure, MARTA began to address some of the controversial issues. MARTA enlisted the support of organized labor by amending the MARTA legislation to include collective bargaining provisions. Also MARTA began a campaign to draw in public officials and blacks into the planning of MARTA. MARTA also modified proposed service plans to include improved service to black neighborhoods, including its decision to use rail instead of bus service for the East-West and Proctor Creek Lines. Also the financial support of the system was changed from an unpopular property tax increase to a one-percent sales tax. Finally MARTA pledged to reduce bus fares to 15 cents for the first seven years. The plan on the 1971 referendum showed of rapid rail lines in 4 counties and of busways. Voters in DeKalb (52% support) and Fulton (51% support) counties approved the proposal, and voters in Clayton (23% support) and Gwinnett (21% support) defeated the proposal. The voters in Clayton and Gwinnett may have reacted negatively to the proposed plan which included only of the rail system would have served both counties. Additionally the method of counting votes was changed for the 1971 referendum. In 1968 voters were grouped into three groups (all of which required a majority for passing): voters in the city limits of Atlanta, voters in Fulton county outside the city limits, and voters in DeKalb outside of the city limits. In 1971 the city votes were counted in the appropriate counties (DeKalb and Fulton), allowing the mostly yes votes from the city to be tabulated against the mostly no votes from the suburban areas in the county. Initial construction In 1971 MARTA purchased the Atlanta Transit System for $12.8 million. In 1973 the state legislature established the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Overview Committee. In 1975 groundbreaking of the rail system took place. Also in 1975 the Urban Mass Transportation Administration offered $600 million to MARTA for a 6-year period for rail transit construction. =East-West Line construction= Construction on the East Line began in 1975 and the first rail service began on June 30, 1979 between the Georgia State and Avondale stations. In June 1993, the Kensington and Indian Creek stations opened, which also marked the first time MARTA rail service went outside I-285. The West Line opened between Hightower (now Hamilton E. Holmes) and Five Points stations, on December 22, 1979. On December 12, 1992 the Proctor Creek Branch and Bankhead Station opened. The 1979 plan for the West Line also included an additional station at Fairburn Road (later shortened to Brownlee-Boulder Park) and another station was planned at the then-existing Perry Homes housing project on the Proctor Creek Line. =North-South Line construction= On December 4, 1981, the North-South Line opened from Garnett to North Avenue, including Civic Center and the lower level of Five Points. On September 11, 1982, the line was expanded to Arts Center, and the Peachtree Center Station (whose opening was delayed from 1981) also opened. The section between Lindbergh Center and Brookhaven opened on December 15, 1984. The line reached Chamblee in 1987, and the Doraville terminus was finished in 1992. The section between Lenox and Doraville was redesignated the Northeast Line on June 8, 1996 when the North Line opened between Buckhead and Dunwoody stations, including a stretch in the Georgia 400 median. The last two North Line stations to open were Sandy Springs and North Springs, on December 16, 2000. The Garnett station opened on December 4, 1981 and was the first South Line station to open. The section between the West End and Lakewood-Fort McPherson opened on December 15, 1984. The East Point Station opened on August 16, 1986. and the College Park and Airport Stations opened on June 18, 1988. The Airport Station however, was built in 1980 as part of the construction of Hartsfield International Airport and was unused until the line was connected in 1988. =Previous expansion plans= MARTA was built with at least three stubs for rail lines which were never built. The Northwest Line towards Cobb County has a stub tunnel east of Atlantic Station, but that redevelopment has not been built with a MARTA station in mind, and Cobb County would instead most likely get a light rail or commuter rail system (either of which have been studied) or a bus rapid transit service (see Northwest Corridor HOV/BRT). The Northwest line was cut back to a distance of two stations, and next the idea was dropped entirely. The South Line's branch to Hapeville was considered for extension into Clayton County as far away as Forest Park, but this idea was also cut off when the voters of that county initially refused to approve tax funding for the line. Another idea for a rail spur line spur was for an above-ground line from near the International Airport for a spur line to the town of Hapeville, but no work has ever been executed. The idea to revive expansion plans in the form of heavy rail and bus was approved to go once again before voters in November 2014 by the Clayton county commissioners in July 2014 with a 1% sales tax providing the funding for said expansion. This time, the referendum was approved and Clayton County voted to join MARTA, the system's first ever expansion outside of Fulton, Dekalb and the city of Atlanta. Yet another proposed spur line would have branched off the Blue Line in DeKalb County, running northeast to the area of North Druid Hills, Emory University, and the town of Tucker. Now under consideration is an idea for light rail line (rather than heavy rail) from Avondale Station to Lindbergh Center, via Emory/CDC. The Northeast Line of the rail system, which has ended in Doraville for two decades, was considered for extension into Gwinnett County as far as northeast as Norcross, Georgia, but this idea was cut off when the voters of that county declined to approve sales-tax funding for it. The Proctor Creek branch was also projected to go one more station northwestward to the West Highlands neighborhood, but no work has been done on that one either.MARTA Provisions. world.nycsubway.org. Retrieved on August 16, 2013. Lack of funding From 2000‚ÄìPresent, there have been no active railway expansion projects in the MARTA system due to lack of additional sales-tax funding, the need to spend its limited capital budget on refurbishing its older rolling stock, replacing the fare-collection system, repairing the tracks and their electrical systems, and other long-term maintenance, repair, and operations requirements. =Financial crisis= In early April 2009, the Georgia General Assembly created a budget crisis for MARTA by failing to pass a bill that would allow it to access its own capital reserve account, in order to compensate for a severe drop in sales-tax revenue during the late-2000s recession. MARTA stated that this could force the agency to discontinue operations one day out of the week, possibly a weekday. The agency's budget crisis forced MARTA to lay off 700 employees. Service cuts and other budget-stabilizing measures began in fiscal year 2011, with the first affected service mark-up in September 2010. Governor Sonny Perdue refused to call a special session as requested, and did not issue an executive order as he stated it would not be legal to do so. Current expansion plans =Mall at Stonecrest expansion= Eastward expansion focuses on bus rapid transit from downtown Atlanta along I-20 and extension of heavy rail transit from Indian Creek station, south along I-285 to I-20, then east along the I-20 corridor to the Mall at Stonecrest. The current Green Line would also be extended east from its current terminus at Edgewood/Candler Park station to Mall at Stonecrest. =Memorial Drive BRT= Currently the only recent expansion in the entire MARTA system was the development of bus rapid transit along Memorial Drive from Kensington Station to the Goldsmith Road MARTA park and ride lot in Stone Mountain and Ponce De Leon Avenue. (Bus Service started operating on September 27, 2010). The bus had two routes: The Q Express runs between MARTA's Kensington Station and a free 150-car Park-and-Ride lot at Goldsmith Road & Memorial Drive; The Express only stops twice along the way at North Hairston Road and again at Georgia Perimeter College. The Q Limited also ran north along Memorial Drive from Kensington Station but branched off at North Hairston Road on the way to East Ponce de Leon Avenue. The Q Limited had four stops along the way in addition the same stops for the Express The implementation of revenue-collecting service had initially been planned for early 2009. Due to low ridership, BRT service was discontinued. =Atlanta BeltLine= neighborhoods; numbers represent discontinuities in current rights of way Additionally, several traffic corridors are currently being studied by MARTA for possible system expansion. The BeltLine is a current proposal for the use of light rail and possibly bus or streetcar service on existing railroad rights-of-way around Atlanta's central business districts. The conversion of existing rail right- of-way to the proposed BeltLine also calls for the creation of three additional MARTA rapid transit stations where existing lines intersect the Belt Line at Simpson Road, Hulsey Yard, and Murphy Crossing. =Clifton Corridor= Rapid transit alternatives are as of October 2011, under consideration for the Clifton Corridor, from Lindbergh Center, following the CSX rail corridor to Emory University and the Center for Disease Control, with possible continuation along the northern edge of Decatur on to Avondale MARTA station. Bus, light rail and heavy rail rapid-transit options had been considered,MARTA Clifton Corridor with light rail being selected as the preferred option.Light Rail Transit Recommended for the Clifton Corridor - Annals of Transportation - Curbed Atlanta. Atlanta.curbed.com (March 22, 2012). Retrieved on 2013-08-16. = Connect 400 = The Georgia 400 Transit Initiative (also known as \\"Connect 400\\") is a MARTA project to study options for expanding high-capacity transit along the Georgia State Route 400 corridor into the northern reaches of Fulton county. The initiative, kicked off in December 2011, envisages an 11.9-mile extension of rapid transit service, starting in the south at North Springs Transit Station, the current terminus of the existing MARTA Red Line. From there, such an extension would continue northward through the cities of Sandy Springs, Roswell, and Alpharetta, terminating in the vicinity of Windward Parkway. As of the fifth public meeting on the subject on September 26, 2013, the study had narrowed the field of transit technology alternatives to three, all using existing right-of-way along SR 400: heavy-rail transit (HRT, extending the Red Line northward), light-rail transit (LRT), or bus rapid transit (BRT). Early designs for all three options include stations near Northridge Road, Holcomb Bridge Road, Mansell Road, North Point Mall, and Windward Parkway; initial sketches of the LRT and BRT options also include a station near Old Milton Parkway. As of June 2015, the project is moving into the Environmental Impact study stage of the planning process. According to MARTA Representatives at the April 2015 meetings, the expansion could open in 2025 at the earliest assuming a best- case scenario. Federal funding is still not approved; the Environmental Impact study must be complete. By the April 2015 meeting, the LRT option has been discarded. The HRT option has been approved as the Locally Preferred Alternative, though two BRT options exist - one that would run in a dedicated bus guideway and the other to integrate with Georgia DOT's planned work for the corridor. The GDOT integrated option would include sharing normal traffic lanes at least in some parts of the route. The plans for stations at Mansell Rd. and Haynes Bridge Rd. have been merged into one station at North Point Mall. =Proposed new infill stations= Adding another station to the existing line near Armour Yard (MARTA's main railyard, opened 2005) has also been discussed, as the Red and Gold MARTA lines, the northeast BeltLine light rail, proposed commuter rail lines to points northeast such as Athens (the \\"Brain Train\\") and Gainesville, would all pass through Armour Yard. Other stations that have been proposed are; Mechanicsville, Boone, Murphy Crossing, and Krog. The proposed Atlanta Multimodal Passenger Terminal (MMPT) would be built next to Five Points station, connecting MARTA to surface passenger rail, including commuter rail, future intercity rail, Amtrak, and possible high- speed rail in the Southeast Corridor. Additional expansion plans for MARTA and other metro Atlanta transportation agencies are detailed in Mobility 2030 a timeline by the Atlanta Regional Commission for improving transit through the year 2030. Recent years =Clayton County= On July 5, 2014, the Clayton County Board of Commissioners, by a margin of 3-1 (Jeff Turner, Shana Rooks, and Sonna Gregory voting in favor,) approved a contract with MARTA to extend service to the county, financed by a 1 percent sales tax. Fulton and DeKalb county leaders approved the expansion. On November 4, 2014, Clayton County residents approved the 1% sales tax to join MARTA. Bus Service was implemented on March 21, 2015. The contract also includes provisions for future rail transit to the county by 2025. One high-capacity/rail proposal calls for stations at Hapeville, Mountain View/ATL Hartsfield International Terminal, Forest Park, Fort Gillem, Clayton State/Morrow, Morrow/Southlake and Jonesboro by 2022. A station at Lovejoy is also proposed, which would open as a later phase. In 2018, commuter rail was selected as the locally preferred alternative of transit mode along the corridor. =Formation of The ATL= In November 2016 Gwinnett and Fulton voters approved a half cent sales tax increase for expanding service. When the Interstate 85 bridge collapsed MARTA announced an extension of service in response to the incident. CEO Keith Parker reported ridership spiked by 25% the day following the collapse. In January 2018 the state legislature wrote House Bill 930 allowing 13 metro Atlanta counties to raise sales tax by 1 cent for transit expansion if voters approve, on May 3, 2018 Governor Nathan Deal signed the bill into law. = Gwinnett County = In September 2018, MARTA's Board of Directors and the Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners gave conditional approval to an agreement which would see MARTA assume, and significantly expand, operations of Gwinnett's bus system (in operation since 2001) and clear the way for the long-sought-after extension of MARTA's rail system into the county from its current terminus at Doraville. The population of Gwinnett County has significantly increased, and become more racially and ethnically diverse, since 1990, the last time the county rejected joining MARTA. The contract with MARTA would go into effect only if a public vote, that was scheduled for March 19, 2019, succeeded. The agreement called for a new one-cent sales tax that would be collected in Gwinnett County until 2057. On March 19th, 2019, the third transit referendum failed, with 54.32% of the vote being \\"No\\" to expand. Gwinnett County Commissioner Charlotte Nash stated that she would possibly try again in the future for another referendum, probably during an election cycle with a bigger turnout.

The card provided eight serial bus channels and a single bi-directional parallel port. The serial connections were often used to interface eight computer terminals to the host system. In combination with the Cromemco Cromix multi-user operating system, this allowed different users to concurrently work on the system. The parallel port was typically connected to an IEEE 1284-type printer. Octart superseded Cromemco's TUART and QUADART and IOP boards. Unlike earlier boards, which merely formatted and exchanged individual data characters, the Octart featured a sophisticated DUART communications circuit plus an independent Z80A processor with 64 KB bytes of memory. This enabled the Octart to: * Perform all protocol and error-detection/recovery functions. * Buffer large amounts of serial data. * Pass only preprocessed data over the host bus using interrupt- driven I/O. This reduced the processing load on the host computer's central processing unit and dramatically increased system throughput. The Octart was a versatile serial subsystem. Under program control, it could switch its internal memory configuration from 16 KB bytes of ROM and 32 KB bytes of RAM to a full 64 KB bytes of RAM. Thus the board can include a ROM bootstrap program which loads an application program, and then switches to 64 KB bytes of RAM for maximum buffer space. The eight serial channels could operate independently of one another in any of four modes: full duplex, auto echo, local loopback, and remote loopback. Each channel could be programmed to automatic wake-up mode for multidrop applications. The Octart required Z80 Cromix version 11.24 or later, or 68000 Cromix 20.61 or later.

The town has a land area of and is the smallest municipality (gmina) in terms of geographical size in Poland. History = Early history = Gothic Exaltation of the Holy Cross church The town was founded by the Teutonic Knights commander of Balga, Heinrich von Muro, on February 5, 1335 at the crossroads of Balga-Heilsberg and Bartenstein-Mehlsack in the heart of the Old Prussian region of Natangia. It was largely destroyed in the wars of 1414 and 1456. In 1440, the town was a founding member of the Prussian Confederation opposing the Teutonic Order. In 1454, King Casimir IV Jagiellon, at the request of the confederation, signed the act of incorporation of the region to the Kingdom of Poland, an event that sparked the Thirteen Years‚Äô War (1454‚Äì1466). The townspeople recognized the Polish King as rightful ruler, hence the town became part of Poland. After the peace treaty signed in Toru≈Ñ in 1466 it was part of the State of the Teutonic Order, although under Polish suzerainty as a fiefdom. After the battle of Grunwald and owing to the economic weakness following this defeat, the Teutonic Order was not able to pay off his debts to its mercenaries anymore, so the town was pawned to Nikolaus von Taubenheim in 1482. Throughout the centuries, the small town changed landlords, eventually the town was the property of the von Schwerin family from 1664 to 1808. In 1710, 767 out of ca. 1000 inhabitants died of the plague. =The Napoleonic era= After the battle of Eylau in February 1807, French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte took lodging at the presbytery of the Lutheran church on 16./17.February 1807, just a few days after the Russian General Bagration. The church itself was used as a camp for Russian POWs captured at Eylau and at the earlier battle of Hoofe (Dworzno). 8000 wounded French soldiers were left in Landsberg. The town suffered from these battles and lost almost half of its inhabitants in the year 1807 due to hunger and disease following this war; in February and March 1807 alone, 400 inhabitants of the Landsberg region died. In 1809, the town counted only 1126 inhabitants and was closer to a village. Town Hall In 1811, parts of the Napoleonic Grande Arm√©e marched through Landsberg on their way to Russia. About 40,000 French soldiers camped at the Landsberg area before marching on and had to be supplied with rations by the inhabitants. =20th century= Gothic Revival Sacred Heart church In 1871 Landsberg became part of Germany. In 1898, it was connected to the railway-line, and in 1908, a municipal gas factory was established, which is today a technical museum. In the beginning of World War I, Russian troops conquered the town for a few days in late August 1914. Owing to some shootings by German soldiers, the post office, one house, and several barns were burned down and seven civilians were executed. A railway bridge was blown up. German troops reconquered the town on September 2, 1914 without fighting. In February 1945, the town and its periphery was the scene for fierce battles between the Wehrmacht and the Red Army, which finally conquered the town on February 2, 1945. As an important travel nexus, a large number of civilians trying to escape from East Prussia were captured here. On June 19, 1945, representatives of the Polish administration came to the town and took over administrative power from the Soviet commandant. Following the Potsdam Conference, the town, having been settled by German-speakers for centuries was voided of its native population in 1946/47, to be resettled with Polish citizens new to the region. The town was renamed to obtain the proper Polish name of G√≥rowo.

LaFleur, 414 U.S. 632 (1974), found that overly restrictive maternity leave regulations in public schools violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment.. Facts The plaintiffs claimed that an employer's requirement to take maternity leave from public schools violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Judgment On January 21, 1974, the Court delivered its ruling. The majority opinion was delivered by Justice Stewart. The Supreme Court ruled that the mandatory maternity leave rules were unconstitutional under the Due Process Clauses in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Essentially, the rules were found to be too arbitrary (fixed dates chosen for no apparent reason) and irrebuttable (having no relation to individual medical conditions and with no way to make exceptions for good reason). In the Court's opinion, Justice Stewart went on to explain: Significance This decision was a major step in protecting the rights of teachers, especially female teachers, from unfair prejudicial rules which would keep them from the profession of teaching. This decision also plays a critical role in the professionalization of teaching by protecting all teachers from arbitrary, political regulations which serve no pedagogical function. The case of LaFleur can also be seen as a building block for current family leave laws, e.g. Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which help to ensure that all people can keep their professions without giving up the ability, and the means, to have a family. Teaching was one of the first careers outside of the home which was open to American women. As a result, in the late 19th century and the 20th century, women dominated the field of teaching. In 1919, 86% of teachers were women. However, traditional attitudes in American society still held that a women's primary role should be that of housewife. This bias was shared by the male administrators and politicians, who generally ran the schools, and thus married women were discouraged from, and overlooked for, teaching positions. This was justified by the belief that men and single women needed the jobs more. Only after the World War II labor shortages were married women widely hired as teachers. After the war, many married women remained employed as teachers; however, traditional prejudices against them endured. The attitude changed focus into discrimination against pregnant women. In 1948, a National Education Association survey showed 43% of schools as having no maternity leave, and the rest having compulsory maternity leave. The compulsory maternity leave rules were grounded in the belief that women were incapable of making their own decisions about work, health care, and their professional competency. Most of these compulsory maternity leave rules required teachers to take leave 4‚Äì6 months before childbirth until well after the child was born, leaving visibly pregnant women basically unable to work. Virtually all maternity leave was unpaid. The stated rationale behind these compulsory maternity leave laws were: that pregnant women could not meet the physical or mental demands of the job, that pregnancy interrupted the continuity of instruction for students, and that pregnant women might get hurt on the job. In this case the court found that this reasoning was faulty, as women do not lose all sense and ability simply because they are visibly pregnant.

The iHeartMedia, Inc. outlet is licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to broadcast at 96.7 MHz with an effective radiated power (ERP) of 9 kW. Its studios are in Columbia (west of the Congaree River) and the transmitter is east of downtown Columbia. History 96.7 FM signed on as WZLD on July 11, 1974 with a mixture of top 40 and oldies music. It became the number one rated station in its first book. However, in late 1977, rival AM Top 40 WNOK countered the success of WZLD by flipping its sister FM to Top 40 as \\"Stereo 105\\". That move would stunt WZLD's growth in the marketplace and the format was changed to album rock as \\"Z-96\\" by 1978. The format was run live-assisted using Drake- Chenault's AOR format. In 1980, the station changed back to Top 40 and both Z-96 and WNOK-FM went head to head for the next six years for the Columbia Top 40 radio audience. In February 1986, Z-96 made a dramatic format change from Top 40 to adult contemporary, but keeping the name. This move proved disastrous and by early 1987, the station changed back to Top 40. This time, however, the station found itself competing with not only WNOK, but with upstart WMMC (now WOMG) as well. In February 1988, WZLD became WYYS with the \\"Yes 97\\" moniker. The format remained Top 40, this time with a lean toward dance music. The station makeover would eventually pay off as WMMC would become WPRH later in 1988 and would leave the Top 40 format altogether one year later. WNOK, however remained dominate in the Top 40 ratings and despite several attempts, could not be unseated. In August 1991, after a brief stunt as \\"Elvis Radio\\", the format was changed to country as \\"Kicks 96\\" with the new call letters of WHKZ. This time, the station targeted longtime country outlet WCOS-FM. Although it had some modest success at first, Kicks 96 was never able to beat WCOS in the ratings. The station was sold in 1994 to Benchmark Communications, which kept the country format as a flanker to protect WCOS, but over time, the station's ratings had started to erode. By 1998, Benchmark was sold to Capstar Broadcasting. Since there was no need for two country stations under the same ownership as well as declining ratings, the decision was made to change WHKZ to a new format. Over Labor Day Weekend in 1998, WHKZ dropped the country format for brief simulcasts of Capstar sister stations WCOS and WVOC. After the stunting, the format was changed to adult contemporary with the name \\"Lite 96.7\\" and the new call letters of WLTY. Despite the changes, Lite 96.7 never really took off in the Columbia market. After seven years of mediocre ratings against the dominant adult contemporary station, WTCB, the station flipped on August 16, 2005 to variety hits as \\"Steve FM\\" (rumored to be named for then-new University Of South Carolina football coach Steve Spurrier, even though he is affiliated with WISW). After a year, the station was able to finish in the Top 5 in the Arbitron ratings, something that has not been achieved on the signal in over a decade. On December 8, 2015, \\"Steve\\", as his namesake did weeks earlier, decided to resign from 96.7 after 11 years. Listeners were asked to choose a new name at Steve FM's website, with that name being revealed on December 14 at 8 AM. At that time, \\"Steve\\" came back out of retirement after just under a week, claiming he just needed some time off. The station is owned by Clear Channel Communications, which also owns Sports talk WCOS-AM, country WCOS-FM, CHR WNOK, Urban contemporary WXBT and News/Talk WVOC in the Columbia radio market.

In planetary science, volatiles are the group of chemical elements and chemical compounds with low boiling points that are associated with a planet's or moon's crust or atmosphere. Examples include nitrogen, water, carbon dioxide, ammonia, hydrogen, methane and sulfur dioxide. In astrogeology, these compounds, in their solid state, often comprise large proportions of the crusts of moons and dwarf planets. In contrast with volatiles, elements and compounds with high boiling points are known as refractory substances. Planetary scientists often classify volatiles with exceptionally low melting points, such as hydrogen and helium, as gases (as in gas giant), whereas those volatiles with melting points above about 100 K (‚Äì173 ¬∞C, ‚Äì280 ¬∞F) are referred to as ices. The terms \\"gas\\" and \\"ice\\" in this context can apply to compounds that may be solids, liquids or gases. Thus, Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants, and Uranus and Neptune are ice giants, even though the vast majority of the \\"gas\\" and \\"ice\\" in their interiors is a hot, highly dense fluid that gets denser as the center of the planet is approached. The Moon is very low in volatiles: its crust contains oxygen chemically bound into the rocks (in, for example, silicates), but negligible amounts of hydrogen, nitrogen, or carbon. Igneous petrology In igneous petrology the term more specifically refers to the volatile components of magma (mostly water vapor and carbon dioxide) that affect the appearance and explosivity of volcanoes. Volatiles in a magma with a high viscosity, generally felsic with a higher silica (SiO2) content, tend to produce eruptions that are explosive. Volatiles in a magma with a low viscosity, generally mafic with a lower silica content, tend to vent and can give rise to a lava fountain. =Volatiles in magma= Some volcanic eruptions are explosive because the mixing between water and magma reaching the surface, releases energy suddenly. Moreover, in some cases, the eruption is caused by volatiles dissolved in the magma. (2008): Fundamentals of Physical Volcanology. Blackwell Publishing, Malden USA Approaching the surface, pressure decreases and the volatiles evolve creating bubbles that circulate in the liquid. The bubbles are connected together forming a network. This especially increments the fragmentation into small drops or spray or coagulate clots in gas. Generally, 95-99% of magma is liquid rock. However, the small percentage of gas present, represents a very large volume when it expands on reaching atmospheric pressure. Gas is a preponderant part in a volcano system because it generates explosive eruptions. Magma in the mantle and lower crust have a lot of volatiles within and water and carbon dioxide are not the only volatiles that volcanoes release. Also they leak hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide. Sulfur dioxide is usually possible to find in basaltic and rhyolite rocks. Volcanoes also release a high amount of hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride as volatiles. =Solubility of volatiles= There are three main factors that affect the dispersion of volatiles in magma: confining pressure, composition of magma, temperature of magma. Pressure and composition are the most important parameters. To understand how the magma behaves rising to the surface, the role of solubility within the magma must be known. An empirical law has been used for different magma-volatiles combination. For instance, for water in magma the equation is n=0.1078 P where n is the amount of dissolved gas as weight percentage (wt%), P is the pressure in megapascal (MPa) that acts on the magma. The value changes for example for water in rhyolite where n=0.4111 P and for the carbon dioxide is n=0.0023 P. These simple equations work if there is only one volatile in a magma. However, in reality, the situation is not so simple because there are often multiple volatiles in a magma. It is a complex chemical interaction between different volatiles. Simplifying, the solubility of water in rhyolite and basalt is function of pressure and depth below the surface in absence of other volatiles. Both basalt and rhyolite lose water with decreasing pressure as the magma rises to the surface. The solubility of water is higher in rhyolite than in basaltic magma. Knowledge of the solubility allows the determination of the maximum amount of water that might be dissolved in relation with pressure. If the magma contains less water than the maximum possible amount, it is undersaturated in water. Usually insufficient water and carbon dioxide exist in the deep crust and mantle, so magma is often undersaturated in these conditions. Magma becomes saturated when it reaches the maximum amount water that can be dissolved in it. If the magma continues to rise up to the surface and more water is dissolved, it becomes supersaturated. If more water is dissolved in magma, it can be ejected as bubbles or vapor water. This happens because pressure decreases in the process and velocity increases and the process has to balance also between decrease of solubility and pressure. Making a comparison with the solubility of carbon dioxide in magma, this is considerably less than water and it tends to exsolve at greater depth. In this case water and carbon dioxide are considered independent. What affects the behavior of the magmatic system is the depth at which carbon dioxide and water are released. Low solubility of carbon dioxide means that it starts to release bubbles before reaching the magma chamber. The magma is at this point already supersaturated. The magma enriched in carbon dioxide bubbles, rises up to the roof of the chamber and carbon dioxide tends to leak through cracks into the overlying caldera. Basically, during an eruption the magma loses more carbon dioxide than water, that in the chamber is already supersaturated. Overall, water is the main volatile during an eruption. =Nucleation of bubbles= Bubble nucleation happens when the a volatile becomes saturated. Actually the bubbles are composed of molecules that tend to aggregate spontaneously in a process called homogeneous nucleation. The surface tension acts on the bubbles shrinking the surface and forces them back to the liquid. The nucleation process is greater when the space to fit is irregular and the volatile molecules can ease the effect of surface tension. The nucleation can occur thanks to the presence of solid crystals, which are stored in the magma chamber. They are perfect potential nucleation sites for bubbles. If there is no nucleation in the magma the bubbles formation might appear really late and magma becomes significantly supersaturated. The balance between supersaturation pressure and bubble's radii expressed by this equation: ‚àÜP=2œÉ/r, where ‚àÜP is 100 MPa and œÉ is the surface tension. If the nucleation starts later when the magma is very supersaturated, the distance between bubbles becomes smaller. Essentially if the magma rises rapidly to the surface, the system will be more out of equilibrium and supersaturated. When the magma rises there is competition between adding new molecules to the existing ones and creating new ones. The distance between molecules characterizes the efficiency of volatiles to aggregate to the new or existing site. Crystals inside magma can determine how bubbles grow and nucleate.

Marin and starring John Wayne and Ella Raines. Written by Paul Fix and Michael Hogan, based on the serialized novel of the same name by Gordon Ray Young, the film is about a tough quiet cowboy who arrives at an Arizona town and discovers that the rancher who hired him has been murdered and that the kindhearted young woman who just inherited the ranch is being manipulated by her overbearing aunt and a scheming Judge who are planning to steal her inheritance. As the cowboy investigates the rancher's murder, he meets the fiery horsewoman who owns a neighboring ranch and who challenges him at first, but eventually falls in love with him. With powerful forces opposed to his presence in the town, the cowboy survives attempts on his life as he gets closer to solving the murder with the help of two beautiful women. Tall in the Saddle was the only film to pair Wayne, who plays the tough cowboy, and Raines, who plays the fiery horsewoman and ranch owner. The film features a strong supporting cast that includes Ward Bond as the scheming lawyer, George \\"Gabby\\" Hayes as the trustworthy sidekick, Audrey Long as the kindhearted young woman, Elisabeth Risdon as the overbearing aunt, and Don Douglas as the stepfather. Tall in the Saddle was filmed on location at Agoura Ranch in Agoura, California; Lake Sherwood, California; RKO Encino Ranch in Encino, California; and Sedona, Arizona. Studio scenes were shot at RKO Studios in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. Principal photography took place from mid- April to mid-June 1944. Produced by Robert Fellows for RKO Radio Pictures, the film was released in the United States on October 17, 1944. Upon its theatrical release, the film received generally good reviews and was successful at the box office, earning $2 million in rentals. The film was Wayne's second of a six-picture contract with RKO and the first with the producer Robert Fellows, with whom Wayne later formed a production company. Plot A tough quiet cowboy named Rocklin (John Wayne) boards a stagecoach headed for the Arizona town of Santa Inez in the late 1800s. He takes a seat alongside the old cantankerous driver, Dave (George \\"Gabby\\" Hayes), who enjoys giving his two women passengers‚Äîoverbearing Miss Elizabeth Martin (Elisabeth Risdon) and her kindhearted niece Clara Cardell (Audrey Long)‚Äîa rough ride through the mountain roads of the sage country. When they stop to rest the horses at a roadside inn, they meet Sheriff Jackson and Bob Clews from Santa Inez, who are investigating the theft of cattle. When Rocklin asks about Red Cardell, the owner of the stolen K.C. Ranch cattle, he learns that he is Clara's great uncle and was recently murdered. A drunken Dave insults them and, pretending to be his friends, they take him to the barn for a \\"short laydown\\". Later Rocklin discovers him unconscious after being pistol-whipped. Rocklin drives the stage the rest of the way to Santa Inez. John Wayne as Rocklin After checking into the hotel, Rocklin is invited by the town lawyer Robert Garvey (Ward Bond) to join a poker game, during which Clint Harolday (Russell Wade), the brash stepson of the owner of the Topaz Ranch, tries to play an illegal card and Rocklin stops him and declares himself the winner. Clint pulls a gun on Rocklin, who walks away from the table, goes to his room, and returns with his guns strapped to his hips and takes his winnings. The next day, Clint's fiery sister Arly (Ella Raines) confronts Rocklin in the street, demanding he hand over her brother's winnings. Ignoring her, even as she fires her gun at him, Rocklin calmly walks away from the confrontation. Later when he learns that Garvey was Red Cardell's lawyer, Rocklin visits his office and shows him a letter written by Cardell hiring him as the K.C. Ranch foreman. As they speak, Miss Martin and Clara enter and the bitter Miss Martin announces that the K.C. Ranch is Clara's legacy. Embarrassed by her aunt's rude behavior, Clara urges Rocklin to keep the $150 he received as advance payment from her great uncle, but Rocklin insists on returning the money. Arly storms into the office and informs Rocklin that her stepfather wants to hire him as the Topaz Ranch foreman. Unaware that it is Arly who made the decision to hire him, Rocklin accepts. When he meets Arly's stepfather Harolday (Don Douglas), Rocklin is assigned to the deserted line camp at Tabletop on the edge of the Topaz Ranch to look for a gang of rustlers who Harolday believes killed Red Cardell. Ella Raines as Arly HaroldayAt the line camp at Tabletop, Dave delivers a letter to Rocklin from Clara in which she returns his $150 and reveals her distrust of Garvey who has convinced her aunt that Clara should sign over the ranch to him and return east. Rocklin is now the only one she trusts. Dave informs Rocklin that Red Cardell and Garvey were once gambling buddies, and that Red usually lost. The day before he was murdered, Cardell was preparing to visit the district judge to present a deck of marked cards he found in a friend's coat‚ÄîRocklin suspects Garvey was the card cheat and murderer. Meanwhile, Arly learns that Dave was delivering a letter to Rocklin from Clara. As she approaches the line camp cabin, someone takes a shot at Rocklin who goes outside to investigate. When he returns, he discovers Arly searching for Clara's letter. Angered and jealous when Rocklin rips up the letter, Arly fires him and orders him off the ranch. After she throws a knife that barely misses him, he takes her in his arms and kisses her passionately, and then leaves. Audrey Long as Clara Cardell Later in town, Rocklin tells Harolday and Clint about the shooting and shows Clint the leather pouch discovered outside the cabin. Clint claims he never saw it before, and after Rocklin leaves, Harolday advises his stepson to leave town, knowing he lied. Meanwhile, Clara visits Rocklin at the hotel and tells him Miss Martin intends to sign an affidavit declaring her to be underage‚Äîan action that would turn the K.C. Ranch over to her aunt‚Äîeven though she provided Garvey with a letter proving she was of legal age. At Garvey's office, Rocklin searches for the letter, unaware that the scheming Garvey just burned it. During his search, Rocklin finds two decks of marked cards in Garvey's desk and accuses him of murdering Red Cardell. When Rocklin says he intends to show the cards to the district judge, Garvey draws his gun and the two engage in a violent struggle that ends with Garvey knocked unconscious. Rocklin returns to the hotel, where Arly has revealed to Clara that she and Rocklin kissed at Tabletop. Angered by Arly's indiscretion, Rocklin assures Arly that he'll allow no woman to hogtie and brand him. John Wayne and Russell Wade as Clint Harolday A dejected Clara returns to her ranch where her aunt forces her to admit that she and Rocklin intend to travel together to the district judge and have Garvey investigated. Miss Martin quickly sends Garvey a letter warning him. That night, Dave brings Clint to the hotel where Rocklin interrogates him about Garvey's involvement in Red Cardell's murder. Outside the hotel, Arly's trusted companion Tala (Frank Puglia) watches someone climb the outside stairs to the window of Rocklin's room. When Clint sees someone reaching through the window, take Rocklin's gun, and aim it at Rocklin, he shoves Rocklin out of the way and is shot. The killer tosses the gun back into the room in order to frame Rocklin. Hearing the gunshot, townspeople rush into the room and see Rocklin with the gun in his hand standing over Clint's dead body. When Garvey accuses Rocklin of murdering Clint, he denies the accusation and escapes through the window. Garvey organizes a posse and chases after Rocklin, who heads to the K.C. Ranch. After Arly learns from Tala that he saw her brother's killer and it was not Rocklin, the two take a treacherous canyon shortcut in order to get to the K.C. Ranch before the posse and help him. Meanwhile, at the ranch, Miss Martin admits to Clara that Rocklin is the nephew of Red Cardell and stands to inherit everything, and that she and Garvey schemed to prevent that from happening. Rocklin and Dave overhear the aunt's admission and Dave ties her up. Bob and George Clews arrive, disarm Rocklin, and knock him unconscious. Miss Martin orders the brothers to take them to Garvey in town. As Garvey's henchmen attempt to leave the ranch, they are stopped by Arly and Tala, who free Rocklin and Dave. Ignoring Arly's warning about the approaching posse, Rocklin returns to the ranch house for Clara. When the posse arrives, Miss Martin tells them the brothers took Rocklin back to town. As the posse heads off, Miss Martin and Garvey discuss their scheme, unaware that Rocklin is listening from the next room. Outside, Harolday prepares to shoot Rocklin through a window when Arly and Tala stop him. When Arly tells Rocklin that Tala saw Harolday kill Clint and that the leather pouch belongs to Harolday, Rocklin knows that it was Harolday who murdered Red Cardell. When Harolday tries to escape, Tala kills him with his knife. Afterwards, Garvey confesses that Harolday was the brains behind the scheme to acquire all the ranches in the area, split them up into smaller parcels, and sell them to farmers. Garvey also acknowledges that Harolday killed Cardell when the old man threatened to expose him as a card cheat and that the bullet that killed Clint was intended for Rocklin. When Arly sees Rocklin and Clara discussing the future, she leaves. Clara, however, knows that she doesn't belong in the west and tells Rocklin she will be returning east. She also indicates that he belongs with Arly. Sometime later, Dave and Tala see Rocklin and Arly in a passionate embrace.

It was created by Harold Goodglass and Edith Kaplan. The exam evaluates language skills based on perceptual modalities (auditory, visual, and gestural), processing functions (comprehension, analysis, problem- solving), and response modalities (writing, articulation, and manipulation). Administration time ranges from 20 to 45 minutes for the shortened version but it can last up to 120 minutes for the extended version of the assessment. There are five subtests which include: conversational & expository speech, auditory comprehension, oral expression, reading, and writing. In the extended version all questions are asked while in the shortened version only a few questions are asked within each subtest. Many other tests are sometimes used by neurologists and speech language pathologists on a case-by-case basis, and other comprehensive tests exist like the Western Aphasia Battery. Description The Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination provides a comprehensive exploration of a range of communicative abilities. Its results are used to classify patient's language profiles into one of the localization based classifications of aphasia: Broca's, Wernicke's, anomic, conduction, transcortical, transcortical motor, transcortical sensory, and global aphasia syndromes, although the test does not always provide a diagnosis or a therapeutic approach. The assessment provides a severity rating. The Examination is designed to go beyond simple functional definitions of aphasia into the components of language dysfunctions (symptoms) that have been shown to underlie the various aphasic syndromes. Thus, this test evaluates various perceptual modalities (e.g., auditory, visual, and gestural), processing functions (e.g., comprehension, analysis, problem-solving), and response modalities (e.g., writing, articulation, and manipulation). This approach allows for the neuropsychological analysis and measurement of language-related skills and abilities from both ideographic and nomothetic bases, as well as a comprehensive approach to the symptom configurations that relate to neuropathologic conditions. The test is divided into five subtests and include assessment of conversation and expository speech (simple social responses, free conversation, and picture description), auditory comprehension (at the word-level, sentence level, and complex ideational material), oral expression (automatized sequences, repetition, and naming), reading (basic symbol recognition, number matching, word identification-picture-word matching, oral reading, and reading comprehension), and writing (mechanics, encoding skills, written picture naming, and narrative writing).In Depth Review of the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (BDAE) - Stroke Engine. (2015). Retrieved from http://www.strokengine.ca/indepth/bdae_indepth/ =Scoring= The manual provides clear statements and rules for scoring protocols. Once the scores are collected, the examiner completes the Summary of Scores and inserts them into the Summary Profile of Standard Subtests in the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination Record Booklet to get percentiles. The percentiles are listed as 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 only. The scores that are collected are a tally of the number of correct responses, the number of cues given, number of phonemic cues, etc. =Reliability= Reliability of the subtests was studied by selecting protocols of 34 patients with a degree of severity of aphasia ranging from slight to severe. Kuder-Richardson reliability coefficients for subtests ranged from 0.68 to 0.98, with about two-thirds of the coefficients reported ranging from 0.90 upwards. Since test- retest reliability is difficult if not impossible to attain with patients suffering from aphasic symptoms, the current reliability coefficients demonstrate very good internal consistency in terms of what the items within the subtests are measuring. =Validity= Validity: A discriminant analysis comparing \\"unambiguous exemplars of a single syndrome\\" was carried out. Thus, unambiguous cases of Broca‚Äôs aphasia, Wernicke‚Äôs aphasia, conduction aphasia, and anomic aphasia were selected. Ten variables were selected on the assumption of providing the most useful data. From these, five variables were selected for the discriminant analysis (body part identification, repetition of high probability sentences, verbal paraphasias, articulatory agility rating, and automated sentence rating). This classification yielded no misclassifications. =Norms= Standardization of the revised Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination is based on a normative sample of 242 patients with aphasic symptoms tested at the Boston VA Medical Center between 1976-1982.

The Rammachgau was located in northern Upper Swabia. Origin and name Alemannia (orange) and Upper Burgundy (green) around AD 1000, showing the location of the Rammachgau as \\"Rammgau\\" After the resistance of the Alamannic nobles to Frankish rule had been overcome in 746, the Duchy of the Alamanni was administratively incorporated into the Frankish kingdom by implementing the Frankish units of administration there too. The Franks used the term Gau to denote a politico-geographical division within the Frankish kingdom. The term Gau was often suffixed to a distinctive geographical place name. One of these administrative units was the Rammachgau. The name of this administrative unit derived from the name of a river, or part thereof, called Rammach. The name of the river was subsequently lost.K. Diemer, Laupheim, p. 66 Contemporary documents refer to this administrative unit as Rammackeuui (778),Wirtembergisches Urkundenbuch, p. 21 Rammekevve (894),Wirtembergisches Urkundenbuch, p. 198 Rammichgowe (ca. 1070)K. Zeuss, Traditiones possessionesque Wizenburgenses, p. 303 and Rammechgowe (1099).Wirtembergisches Urkundenbuch, p. 321 It has been suggested that the Rammachgau, together with the Nibelgau and the Illergau, belonged to a larger administrative unit called pagus Duria during the period of Carolingian rule.M. Borgolte, Geschichte der Grafschaften Alemanniens in fr√§nkischer Zeit, p. 181f. The fall of the Hohenstaufen dynasty and the simultaneous dissolution of central authority in the 13th century gave the local nobility the opportunity to increase its independence from central authority. Consequently, various local rulers managed to establish authority over territories within the Rammachgau, rendering the old administrative units, based on counts as being the representative of the central authority, obsolete. Expanse The Rammachgau stretched from the south at Altheim, Langenschemmern and Ochsenhausen to the north at H√ºttisheim and Dellmensingen, from the west at Ingerkingen to the east at Burgrieden. The Rammachgau was bordered to the south by the Haistergau, to the east by the Illergau and to the west by the Ruadolteshuntare. To the north the Rammachgau bordered on the territory of the Illergau as well as the Ruadolteshuntare. The area of settlement of the Rammachgau was marked by natural borders except to the north. The populated areas were all in, or in close proximity to, the valleys of the rivers Ri√ü, Rottum and Rot. The borders were marked by large forests on the hills surrounding the rivers or by swampy areas unsuitable for agriculture. The administrative centre of the Rammachgau was Laupheim.

Discovered by fishermen in the early 1990s, the Vietnamese government made several attempts to organise an investigation of the site but were confounded by the water depth of . History The ship was carrying a large cargo of Vietnamese ceramics dated to the mid- to late 15th century. The provenance of the pieces was known to be the kilns of the Red River Delta (such as Chu Dau) because excavations in the region had been ongoing since their discovery in 1983. The only pieces remaining at the kiln sites were faults pieces. Intact examples of the wares produced were rare, since all were exported. When the wreck was found there was excitement among collectors and archaeologists, for it promised the first cargo consisting solely of Vietnamese wares.Other wrecks with portions of their cargoes being Vietnamese have been discovered in the South China Sea: the Pandanan Wreck, Vung Tau Wreck, the Lena Cargo, and others. The wreck was discovered by fishermen around the early 1990s. For several years the site was intensively plundered resulting in pieces turning up on the market all over the world. The method employed by the looters was to drag a series of hooks across the site with nets behind the catch to dislodge artefacts. The Vietnamese authorities became aware of the wreck following the arrest of two dealers at Da Nang airport who had in their possession suitcases full of pottery from the site. The wreck was beyond standard diving depth, but something had to be done quickly to prevent further looting. In 1996, Malaysian-Chinese businessman Ong Soo Hin teamed up with Oxford University archaeologist Mensun Bound to work with Vietnam's National History Museum in excavating the site, with York Archaeological Trust providing conservation services. The project took four years and cost an estimated $US14 million. Over 250,000 intact ceramic artefacts were recovered. Over three seasons the team excavated a third of a million pieces of pottery. Most of the pottery was repetitive everyday table ware of little artistic value but there were also items of outstanding artistry. An ‚ÄòEvaluation Committee‚Äô of leading Vietnamese archaeologists and art historians selected all the unique pieces for the National Collection in Hanoi and then other museums were invited to select what they wished. Six museums in Vietnam now host permanent exhibitions of material from the wreck. The remaining 90% was sold at auction in 2000 by Butterfields in San Francisco, USA with the Vietnamese Salvage Agency, Saga Horizon and the Vietnamese Ministry of Culture dividing any money made. Part of the proceeds were used to pay for the display, curation and study of the selection that went into the National Collection. The project partners were: Oxford University MARE, Saga Horizon, Vietnam National Salvage Agency (VISAL) and the National History Museum (Hanoi).

Considered one of the foremost writers on African feminism, gender studies and literary theory, she was a social critic who came to be recognized as a viable authority on African women among black feminists and feminists in general.Douglas, Carol Anne, \\"Women in Nigeria Today\\", off our backs, Washington, 30 November 1987. She contributed the piece \\"Not Spinning on the Axis of Maleness\\" to the 1984 anthology Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women's Movement Anthology, edited by Robin Morgan. She is most celebrated for coining the term STIWA or Social Transformation in Africa Including Women. Life Abiodun Omolara Ogundipe was born in Lagos, Nigeria, to a family of educators and clergy. She attended Queen's School, Ede, and went on to become the first woman to obtain a first-class BA Honours degree in English at University College Ibadan, then a college of the University of London. She later earned a doctorate in Narratology (the theory of narrative) from Leiden University, one of the oldest universities in Europe. She taught English Studies, Writing, Comparative Literature and Gender from the perspectives of cultural studies and development at universities in several continents, and was also a Professor of Englsh and Comparative Lterature at the University of Port Harcourt, Rivers State Nigeria. She rose to prominence early in her career in the midst of a male-dominated artistic field concerned about the problems afflicting African men and women. Molara Ogundipe was described as being \\"at the forefront of the theoretical dynamism which is unfolding within African feminism. She has a powerful and deeply ingrained cultural understanding of the dynamics of gender relations in the pre-colonial and colonial Yoruba society as a pivot for theory\\", Over the years, she was a critic of the oppression of women and argued that African women are more oppressed in their status and roles as wives. In view of their multiple identities, in some of which identities they enjoy status, privilege, recognition and agency. She criticized the plight of African women as due to the impact of imposed colonial and neo-colonial structures that often place African males at the height of social stratification. Their plight is also due to the internalization of patriarchy by African women themselves.Edward, Jane Kani, \\"Issues of Concern for African Ferminists\\", in Sudanese Women Refugees: Transformations and Future Imaginings, Palgrave Macmillan, 2007, p. 55. She, however, insisted on an understanding of the complexity of the statuses of African women in their pre-colonial and indigenous cultures for any useful discussion or study of African women. Ogundipe was in the leadership of feminist activism and gender studies in Africa for decades. She was the Founder and Director of the Foundation for International Education and Mentoring, which is dedicated to teaching young women the doctrine and virtues of feminist theories and gender equality. She lived and worked in West Africa, where she set up writing centres at universities, in addition to her work on literature, gender and film, in contribution to her commitment to inter- generational education and mentoring. She died at the age of 78 in Ijebu-Igbo, Ogun State, Nigeria, in June 2019.\\"Literary giant Omolara Ogundipe-Leslie dies at 78\\", The Guardian (Nigeria), 21 June 2019. She is survived by her two daughters: Dr. (Ts'gye Maryam) Rachel Titilayo Leslie, a scholar of religion in Africa who writes on the significance of African legacies for global culture, and Dr. Isis Imotara Leslie, PhD, a political theorist who has taught at several US universities. Her grandchildren are Askia Tristan Folajimi Leslie, who graduated in Computer Engineering and Coding from the University of California, Berkeley, and Joshua Tolu Victoriano, who was recently ordained a deacon in the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church in Ethiopia.\\"OBITUARY: The Passing of Professor Molara Ogundipe-Leslie\\", Premium Times, 20 June 2019. Writing Molara Ogundipe was in the leadership of feminist and gender studies in Africa since graduating in 1963 from the University of London. She wrote for numerous academic and general publications, and also published books of non-fiction as well as a collection of poetry. Her work is included in anthologies of women's writing: her piece \\"Not spinning on the axis of Maleness\\" is in the 1984 anthology Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women's Movement Anthology, edited by Robin Morgan. And poems by her are in the 1992 anthology Daughters of Africa, edited by Margaret Busby.Busby, Margaret (ed.), Daughters of Africa, Jonathan Cape: 1992, p. 766. Criticism As a Nigerian scholar, critic, educator and activist, Ogundipe is recognized as one of the foremost writers on African women and feminism. She argued for an African-centred feminism that she termed \\"Stiwanism\\" (Social Transformation in Africa Including Women) in her book Recreating Ourselves. A distinguished scholar and literary theorist, she published numerous works of poetry and literary criticism in addition to her works cited below. Stiwanism is concerned with seven principles: \\"STIWA\\" 1) resists Western feminism 2) gives specific attention to African women in this contemporary moment 3) brings to the forefront indigenous feminism that has also existed in Africa 4) believes in both inclusion and participation in the socio-political transformation of the African continent 5) contends with a woman's body, personhood, nationhood, and society and how it operates within socio-economic hierarchies 6) is intentionally specific to the individual and collective identity (i.e. religion, class, and marital status) 7) recognizes that there are many factors and identities in Africa and individual personhoods operating in different and contradictory ways. Ogundipe earlier in her career had posited that a true feminist writer had to understand or describe effectively a woman's viewpoint and how to tell the story about a woman. She strongly believed that rediscovering the role of women in Nigeria's social and political institutions may be the best way to improve those institutions. She was known as a writer whose works capture most vividly the complexities of African life. In Re-Creating Ourselves: African Women and Critical Transformations, she wrote brilliantly about the dilemma of writing in her traditional language and men's resistance to gender equality. Through the vast literary experiences and many gender-related writings, Ogundipe provided \\"intricate oeuvre\\" that enable African feminists to engage in bringing meaningful changes in issues related to gender, family and society that can drive national and continental development.

She trained and worked with Ernst and Michael Fuchs, a classical artist who taught her Mischtechnik. Through Fuchs she came to know other Visionary artists with whom she has worked, exhibited and co-founded the Academy of Visionary Art in Vienna and the Colorado Alliance for Visionary Art. Sage is a lecturer, teacher, and live artist with works in international galleries and museums. Early life Amanda Sage was born on 19 April 1978 in Denver, Colorado. She \\"did a lot of drawing\\" as a young girl and developed an interest in art in a home that allowed for experimentation. Her mother's name, meant to symbolize universal interconnectedness, is \\"You\\"; It is her full legal name. She lived as a young girl in Deerfield Beach, Florida. Her family returned to Colorado and settled in Boulder, Colorado, where she was spent most of her formative years. Her parents were open-minded people who nurtured their daughter's spirituality, sense of fearlessness and consciousness. The family attended the Unity Church, which embraces a metaphysical interpretation of the Bible. Sage regular meditated mornings at the Unity of Boulder Spiritual Center and went on vision quests and meditative retreats. Sage was schooled at Boulder's Shining Mountain Waldorf School. Its objective is to develop moral courage, independent thinking and artistic talents of its students in alignment with Austrian Rudolf Steiner's educational philosophy. She studied art under Hikaru Hirata-Miyakawa who introduced her to \\"semi-realism\\" and the works of Ernst Fuchs. She developed an interest in painting with acrylics. Hirata-Miyakawa describes Sage as a serious, yet playful student who was a quick-learner. She graduated in 1996. Art =Studies and early career= In Vienna, Austria, she studied the Mischtechnik techniques of the Old Masters for two years under Michael Fuchs. He taught her to study and realistically represent nature. Sage studied under and worked for Ernst Fuchs, Michael's father, starting in 1999. It was a working relationship that spanned ten years and provided opportunities to expand her interest in Visionary art. For five summers she worked on Fuchs' lifetime project in the Apocalypse Chapel in Klagenfurt, Austria. She taught \\"underpainting\\" at Phil Rubinov-Jacobson's 1999 and 2000 \\"Old Master, New Visions\\" in Payerbach, Austria. Rubinov-Jacobson was one of Ernst Fuchs' students in the 1970s. Sage obtained studio space in 2000 in the Viennese WUK cultural center, an artists' collective and cultural center, where she organized cultural events and was a board member. Sage traveled to Bali in 2006 for an artistic vision quest, in which she only carried paint, brushes and a roll of canvas. The purpose of the two-month trip was to develop greater inner awareness and expand her capabilities as a transformative, visionary artist. She made Dreams while in Bali, which introduced the egg motif used in many of her subsequent paintings. =Career= She began to exhibit in the United States with other visionary artists and venues beginning in 2007. That year she began to be represented by Galerie 10, who also represented Ernst Fuchs, Manfred Deix, Rudolf Hausner, Helmut Kand, Anton Lehmden, Arik Brauer, and Wolfgang Hutter. Sage moved to Los Angeles, California, where her works were exhibited at the Temple of Visions gallery. Sage has painted live, conducted workshops and delivered lectures at exhibitions and transformational festivals, like Inner Visions at the Boom Festival in Portugal, Palenque Norte's Burning Man, Harmonic Spaces in Australia, Art Basel Miami, and The Nexus Global Youth Summit. Her works are in galleries and salons worldwide, including Vienna, Australia and Italy. In the United States, her works have been shown in Los Angeles, Chicago and Colorado. =Visionary art organizations= Sage is one of ten members of the Visionary Guild that studied under Fuchs. The guild is part of the Vienna Academy of Visionary Art that opened in September 2013, the idea of which was conceived by Sage and done in concert with Laurence Caruana and A. Andrew Gonzalez. She met both men in 2000 when working with Ernst Fuchs. Vienna was a desired locale because of the influence of the Vienna School of Fantastic Realism. The academy is located near Ernst Fuchs' studio, the Palais P√°lffy and Phantasten Museum, which has some of Sage's works. Her Spring 2014 seminar at the academy is entitled \\"Free Your Expression\\" and covers marketing, exhibition processes, artistic collaboration and live painting. Two other guild members, David Heskin and his wife Aloria Weaver, and Sage founded the Colorado Alliance of Visionary Artists (CAVA). Heskin, Weaver, Sage, Caruana and Hikaru Hirata-Miyakawa participated in the Symposium on Visionary Art & Culture and made live paintings in Boulder on May 23, 2013. =Style, themes and methods= She is considered a talented visionary artist. Her portrait and figure-works are meant to inspire spiritual and personal transformation. They feature waves of \\"intense color\\" that convey boundless growth opportunities. She receives inspiration from live music and her own ideas or emotions. She begins painting by nurturing and allowing a story to develop. She uses devices, such as playing music or audiobooks, to allow herself to freely and spontaneously let the painting emerge without overthinking. When she paints live, Sage often receives a nugget from a conversation as inspiration for her work. She sees visionary art as a cultural phenomenon and an art form that tells a universal story of interconnectedness of life and the divine. Believing that \\"art is a powerful, symbolic language,\\" transformation is the ultimate goal to entice awareness and actions to consciously care for one another and the earth. Personally, \\"it's a practice, a meditation, and a dedication that takes me into a space of contemplation.\\" The egg is a common motif in her works. It represents the seed of life and a doorway or portal to the infinite. Sage has said that it is her intention \\"to create portals that open to the infinite possibilities of being and expressing, so that we may remember and re-discover who we are, where we originate from and where we are headed.\\" Another symbolic reference is \\"the train\\" meant to convey regenerative, infinite journeys to bring about spiritual, educational, creative and practical transformation. The work, Regeneration, made in 2012, is one of her favorite paintings: \\"It encompasses a very simple vision and scenario on which to meditate... It is the journey of regeneration, activation, collaboration, and participation ‚Äì rooted in compassion, forgiveness, and love.\\" Notes References Further reading * * External links *Official Website Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:Fantastic realism Category:American women painters Category:Psychedelic artists Category:Visionary artists Category:American contemporary painters Category:Waldorf school alumni Category:Painters from Colorado Category:20th-century American painters Category:20th-century American women artists Category:21st-century American women artists ","title":"Amanda Sage"},{"id":"9447335","title":"Tony Bellotto"},{"id":"9447342","text":"The term Danish Empire may refer to: * The North Sea Empire of Cnut the Great (1016‚Äì1035) * Danish control of Danish Estonia (1219‚Äì1346, 1559‚Äì1645) * The Kalmar Union (1397‚Äì1523) *Denmark‚ÄìNorway (1524‚Äì1814) * The Danish colonial empire in North America, the West Indies, the Gold Coast and India *The unity of the Realm, the relations between metropolitan Denmark and its two overseas regions, the Faroe Islands and Greenland ","title":"Danish Empire"},{"id":"9447348","text":"Martin R√∂ing (born May 10, 1979) is a Swedish Bandy player who currently plays in IFK V√§nersborg as a defender.

Biography Imam-Quli Khan was the son of Allahverdi Khan (Undiladze), the celebrated Georgian general in the service of Iran‚Äôs Safavid Dynasty. Imam-Quli Khan is first mentioned as governor of Lar in Fars in 1610. He succeeded his father as governor-general (beglarbeg) of Fars in 1615, but retained his position at Lar and was granted the rank of an amir of the divan by Shah Abbas I. In 1619-20, Imam-Quli Khan oversaw Abbas‚Äôs project to link the headwaters of the Karun and Zayandarud rivers in order to enhance the water supply of his capital, Isfahan. Shah Abbas placed complete trust in Imam-Quli Khan who grew in influence and prestige and became one of the wealthiest khans of the Safavid empire. One day, Shah Abbas even jokingly said to Imam-Quli: \\"I request, Imam-Quli, that you will spend one dirham less per day, that there may exist some slight difference between the disbursements of a khan and a king!\\" Imam-Quli built a madrasa and many palaces in Shiraz and the still standing bridge Pol-e Khan over the Kor at Marvdasht.Roger M.

Being in charge of the Safavids' southern possessions, Imam-Quli Khan continued his father‚Äôs policy of undermining the Portuguese positions in the Persian Gulf. In 1621, he persuaded the English East India Company to cooperate with the Persians by threatening to cancel the trading privileges that had been granted to the company by the shah in 1615. As a result, Imam-Quli Khan‚Äôs army aided by the English navy captured the strategic Portuguese fort on the island of Qeshm and laid a siege to Hormuz, which surrendered after a defence of ten weeks on 22 April 1622. The khan‚Äôs military exploits are commemorated in the works by the poet Qadri from Fars.Sussan Babaie (2004), Slaves of the Shah: New Elites of Safavid Iran, p. 120. I.B.Tauris, According to the Safavid historian Fazli Khuzani, Imam-Quli Khan had 22 daughters, of which some were married to Safavid Georgian gholams of noble origin in 1622. In 1626, when Imam-Quli's daughter and son-in-law Anduqapar Amilakhori were captured by rebellious Georgians, Abbas I sent a large army in order to rescue them.  Fall and death  After the death of Abbas, Imam-Quli Khan found himself in disagreement with new favorites of Shah Safi, Abbas‚Äôs successor to the throne of Persia, and became marginalized. This circumstance lasted until he and his two sons, one of them being Safiqoli Khan, were put to death at Safi's orders in late 1632, while his vast possessions were converted into the crown domain in 1633. This formed the prelude to the massacre of the rest of his family. Only his brother, Daud Khan, survived as he had fled to Georgia. Though the Undiladze Safavid Georgian line was nearly completely eliminated after the purge, the succession of the line amongst the court elites was assured by Ja'far Qoli, a grandson of Imam-Quli Khan by a daughter. A statue to Imam-Quli Khan was erected in Qeshm in the 1990s.\\"Iran: Qeshm islanders await a second invasion\\". MEED 5 July 1996  References   Sources  * *Roger M.

Situated in the Swabian Alb region of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany, this castle dominates the skyline of the town of Sigmaringen. The castle was rebuilt following a fire in 1893, and only the towers of the earlier medieval fortress remain. Schloss Sigmaringen was a family estate of the Swabian Hohenzollern family, a cadet branch of the Hohenzollern family, from which the German Emperors and kings of Prussia came. During the closing months of World War II, Schloss Sigmaringen was briefly the seat of the Vichy French Government after France was liberated by the Allies. The castle and museums may be visited throughout the year, but only on guided tours. It is still owned by the Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen family, although they no longer reside there. Location Sigmaringen is located on the southern edge of the Swabian Jura, a plateau region in southern Baden-W√ºrttemberg. The Hohenzollern castle was built below the narrow Danube river valley in the modern Upper Danube Nature Park (German: Naturpark Obere Donau). The castle rises above the DanubeThe castle is located about above sea level, while the Danube here is about . on a towering chalk projection that is a spur of the white Jura Mountains formation. The hill is known simply as the Schlossberg or Castle Rock. The Schlossberg is about long and up to above the river. On this free- standing towering rock, the princely Hohenzollern castle is the largest of the Danube valley castles. The sheer cliffs and steep sides of the tower made it a natural site for a well-protected medieval castle. History =Construction of the first castle= The castle lies on the Danube, atop a 115-foot chalk cliff known as the Schlossberg The first castle at Sigmaringen appeared during the end of the Early Middle Ages, during the early 11th century. The castle was first mentioned in 1077House of Hohenzollern website-The Castle accessed 15 November 2008 following the unsuccessful siege of Burg Sigmaringen by Rudolf of Rheinfelden in his fight against the King of Germany, Henry IV.From the Chronicle of Petershausen Abbey: From there King Rudolf of Swabia marched to Burg Sigmaringen and besieged it. Once he discovered that King Henry IV. and his army approached though the alpine passes toward his army, he lifted the siege and moved to Sachsen. In 1083 a pair of brothers, Ludwig and Manegold von Sigmaringen, are listed as witnesses on a document for the K√∂nigseggwald abbey. Ludwig von Sigmaringen was married to Richinza von Spitzenberg, daughter of Berthold I. von Z√§hringen.From Heinz B√ºhler: Richinza von Spitzenberg und ihr Verwandtenkreis. Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte der Grafen von Helfenstein. In: W√ºrttembergisch Franken, vol. 58, 1974. In the book she is called vidua de Spitzenberg At the end of the 11th century he built a castle on the Spitzenberg at Kuchen, Germany. The castle and the surrounding land and villages were part of the inheritance of Richinza. From their marriage Richinza and Ludwig had four children; Mathilde von Spitzenberg, the wife of Aribo von Wertingen, the clergyman Ulrich von Sigmaringen, Ludwig II von Sigmaringen-Spitzenberg and Manegold von Sigmaringen-Spitzenberg. The three brothers, Ulrich, Ludwig and Mangold von Sigmaringen are named as the founders of the 11th-century St. George's Abbey in the Black Forest. From 1133 until 1170 Rudolf von Sigmaringen-Spitzenberg, the son of Ludwig II, ruled at Sigmaringen. In 1183 Graf Ludwig von Sigmaringen-Spitzenberg-Helfenstein,House of Hohenzollern-The Architects of Sigmaringen accessed 15 November 2008 the son of Rudolf, is mentioned at the castle. In 1147 Ludwig as well as his father Rudolf and brother Ulrich II von Sigmaringen-Spitzenberg are mentioned in a document of Walter von Dillingen, Prince-Bishop of Augsburg, as lords of Spitzenberg-Sigmaringen. =Under the Helfenstein family, until 1290= Under the Helfenstein family, the castle was renovated around 1200. The castle was totally rebuilt with buckel stones (squared-off stones with a rounded outer surface). Between 1209 and 1258 the castle was occupied by Graf Gottried von Sigmaringen-Helfenstein and his son Graf Gebhard von Sigmaringen-Pietengau. In 1258 the cousin of Graf Gebhard, Graf Ulrich II. von Helfenstein, became the owner of Burg Sigmaringen. Later, Ulrich's daughter Agnes married Graf Ulrich I. von Montfort. Following the marriage in 1272, Sigmaringen was owned by the Counts of Montfort. Then, in 1290 Graf Hugo V. von Montfort, son of Ulrich I, sold the castle and the city of Sigmaringen to Albrecht and Rudolf von Habsburg. Before 1325 Duke Luipold von Habsburg sold the castle and the county of Sigmaringen to the Count of W√ºrttemberg. =Werdenberg family 1399‚Äì1534= Finally in 1399 Count Eberhard von W√ºrttemberg granted the castle and county of Sigmaringensein as well as the county of Veringen in Margraviate of Austria, to his uncle and liegeman Count Eberhard III. von Werdenberg (1387‚Äì1416) as a fief. His son Count Johann IV. von Werdenberg (1416‚Äì1465) and his wife Countess von W√ºrttemberg (disinherited by the House of W√ºrttemberg), in 1459 inherited the castle and county of Sigmaringen. To protect his land, in the following year he declared Sigmaringen an Austrian fief. From 1460 until 1500 the Counts von Werdenberg renovated the Burg (a military fortress) into Schloss Sigmaringen (a fortified residence), and expanded it to the dimensions which remain today. Toward the end of the 15th century they built two long, angular buildings in the north east. Then, in the early 16th century another wing was added to the west. The two round towers that flank the entrance to the castle also date from this time Hugo IX. zu Sigmaringen (1459‚Äì1508), son of Johann IV., died without any male offspring. His sister Anna von Werdenberg married Count Friedrich von F√ºrstenberg in 1516. In 1521 Christoph (1494‚Äì1534), together with his brothers Johann VI. and Felix I. von Werdenberg, was granted the fief of Sigmaringen from Emperor Charles V. Count Christoph married, after his first marriage to Eleonore Gonzaga remained childless, Johanna von Br√∂seln, widow of the Count Eitel Friedrich III. von Hohenzollern in 1526. All of his children died, except for his daughter Anna, who married Friedrichs II. von F√ºrstenberg. According to the Zimmern ChronicleZimmerische Chronik:Band 3:Seite 82. in 1530, as Count Felix I was in the bath house with Leonora Werdenberg (the illegitimate daughter of Hugo IX and the mistress of Felix and Christoph von WerdenbergZimmerische Chronik:Band 2:Seite 267) the bath house fire was allowed to spread, leading to a fire that expanded throughout the outbuildings around the castle. In 1534, following the death of the last male member of the Werdenberger family, Count Friedrich von F√ºrstenberg demanded the Werdenberger lands. However, King Ferdinand I granted the fief of Sigmaringen and Veringen, in 1535, to Charles I of Hohenzollern (1516‚Äì1576), the son from Johanna von Br√∂seln's first marriage with Friedrich III. von Hohenzollern. =The Hohenzollern and Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen families, 1535‚Äì1850= Charles I was the first Hohenzollern to rule in Sigmaringen. In 1539 there was another fire that damaged the castle. A year later, in 1540, Sigmaringen and Veringen were transferred to the House of Hohenzollern as part of the Pfullendorf agreement (German: Pfullendorfer Vertrag). Count Charles I. von Hohenzollern occupied the castle. The main gateway Charles II. von Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen (1547‚Äì1606), son of Charles I was the count of Sigmaringen from 1576 until 1606. He was also the founder of the Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen line of the Hohenzollern family. Under Charles II the castle was renovated. Between 1576 and 1606 the gatehouse was expanded to cover the entrance to the castle and a new church was built near the castle. In 1576 the House of Hohenzollern split into four lines, Hohenzollern (died out in 1602), Hohenzollern-Haigerloch (absorbed by Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen after 1630), Hohenzollern-Hechingen (died out in 1869) and Hohenzollern- Sigmaringen. Sigmaringen was the main residence of the family of Hohenzollern- Sigmaringen from 1576 until 1850. House of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen Inner courtyard of the castle Johann von Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen (1578‚Äì1638), the son of Charles II was the count of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen from 1606 until 1623. Then in 1623 the family was promoted from Count (German: Graf) to the rank of Princes of the Holy Roman Empire (German: Reichsf√ºrst). Johann then became the first prince (German: F√ºrst) of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. During the Thirty Years' War, the castle was besieged by Swedish troops in 1632, and retaken by the Imperial troops in the following year. During the attack by Imperial troops under General Horn, the eastern section of the castle was destroyed by fire. Before the siege, Johann fled to Bavaria. He would remain in Bavaria until his death, at age 60, in 1638. Johann's son, Meinrad I (1605‚Äì1681), was the prince from 1638 until 1681. Meinrad had the burned eastern wing rebuilt during 1658 and 1659 by the master builder Michael Beer. Both eastern buildings, built when the Werdenberg family owned Sigmaringen, were combined under a single roof. Maximilian (1636‚Äì1689), son of Meinrad I, was prince of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen from 1681 until 1689. Castle Sigmaringen with the city and mill. The roof on the central tower was replaced with a pointed spire in 1877 His son Meinrad II (1673‚Äì1715) ruled from 1689 until 1715. From 1698 on he ruled in Haigerloch. His son, Josef (1702‚Äì1769) ruled from 1715 until 1769. In 1724 Josef ordered the construction of the Marstalles or royal stables. In addition to this construction, in 1736 he had the castle modernized and the Knights' Hall (German: Rittersaal) was built. In 1867 it was refurnished and renamed the Ancestors' Hall (German: Ahnensaal). His son, Karl Friedrich reigned from 1769 until 1785. Karl Friedrich's son, Anton Aloys (1762‚Äì1831), reigned from 1785 until 1831. Between 1815 and 1817 he had the granary rebuilt as a five-story knights' building, which became known as Wilhelm's building (German: Wilhelmsbau). Prince Karl (1785‚Äì1853), the son of Anton Aloys, ruled from 1831 until 1848. In 1833 Karl called a constitutional assembly (German: Landtag) together and created a constitutional charter that would be the law in his lands. He founded a hospital for his subjects, and had the St√§ndehaus built on the modern Leopoldsplatz in Sigmaringen (today owned by the Hohenzollerischen Landesbank). Karl also removed the burden of serfdom and various other medieval laws.Gustav Schilling: Geschichte des Hauses Hohenzollern, in genealogisch fortlaufenden Biographien aller seiner Regenten von den √§ltesten bis auf die neuesten Zeiten, nach Urkunden und andern authentischen Quellen, F. Fleischer, 1843, S. 300 ff. During the German Revolution of 1848 Karl abdicated in favor of his son, Karl Anton, on 27 August 1848.German monarchy.de accessed 22 January 2010 In recognition of Karl's efforts to improve the lives of his subjects, in 1857 the hospital that he built was renamed the F√ºrst-Carl-Landesspital (Prince Carl Regional Hospital). In 1869 Karl Anton, following the death of Konstantin the last prince of Hohenzollern- Hechingen, annexed the lands of Hohenzollern-Hechingen and became the prince of Hohenzollern. =A destination for the rich and powerful= Fountain from the Portuguese Gallery Karl Anton built the castle into a meeting point for the nobility of Europe. Portions of the castle were rebuilt and decorated to make Schloss Sigmaringen into a destination of the rich and powerful. In 1855 the walls of the upper story were removed to create the Old German Hall (German: Altdeutschen Saal). In 1864 he modified the arches above the southern curtain wall to form the Weapons Room (German: Waffenhalle). From 1862 until 1867 he built the new Art Gallery (German: Kunsthalle), which is today a museum. As a member of the German high nobility, Karl Anton needed a centerpiece of his elegant castle. To create this, in 1872 he had the Parisian architect Lambert rebuild the dining hall into the French Hall (German: Franz√∂sische Saal). In 1877 he expanded the central keep, removed the old roof and topped the keep with a new pointed roof. In the following year, the Ancestors' Hall (German: Ahnensaal) was rebuilt. The French Hall (German: Der Franz√∂sische Saal), used as a dining room Since 1871 the castle has been open for guided tours. These tours provide a history of the castle as well as the House of Hohenzollern. Leopold (1835‚Äì1905), the son of Karl Anton, was offered the Spanish crown after the Spanish Revolution of 1868 overthrew Queen Isabella II. He was supported by the Prussian Prime Minister Otto von Bismarck, but opposed by the French emperor Napoleon III. Leopold was forced to decline the offer, but the extra demands made by the French government and the sending of the Ems Telegram resulted in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì71, which led to the fall of emperor Napoleon III and the setting up of the French Third Republic. Following the war and the death of Karl Anton, he ruled as prince of the Houses of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen and Hohenzollern from 1885 until his death in 1905. In 1893 the eastern wing burned and was nearly totally destroyed. Starting in 1895, the construction manager Johannes de Pay and the Munich architect Emanuel von Seidl rebuilt the destroyed section. In 1899 and 1906, other sections of the castle were redone in the eclectic style (a combination of Romanesque, Gothic and mostly Renaissance styles) that was common at the time. The Portuguese Gallery (German: Portugiesische Galerie) was built during this reconstruction. The construction continued under Leopold's son, Wilhelm (1864‚Äì1927) who was prince of the Houses of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen and Hohenzollern from 1905 until 1927. Photochrom print (color photo lithograph) of Schloss Sigmaringen from 1890 to 1905 In 1901, the pointed spire on the keep was destroyed. It was replaced with an octagonal pointed neo-gothic tower made from tuff stone. Leopold's son Friedrich (1891‚Äì1965) was the prince of the house from 1927 until 1965. He opened the carriage house in the lower story of the museum as an early history museum. =Seat of the Vichy Government= Barbed wire, a witness of the time the Vichy Government-in-Exile occupied Schloss Sigmaringen Following the Allied invasion of France, the French Vichy Regime was moved from France into Schloss Sigmaringen. The princely family was forced by the Gestapo out of the castle and moved to Schloss Wilflingen. The French authors Louis-Ferdinand C√©line and Lucien Rebatet, who had written political and anti-semitic works, feared for their safety and fled to Sigmaringen with the Vichy government. C√©line's 1957 novel D'un ch√¢teau l'autre, (English: From one castle to another) describes the end of the war and the fall of Sigmaringen on 22 April 1945. The book was made into a German movie in 2006, through the German media companies ZDF and Arte, called Die Finsternis (English: The Darkness). =Today= During the 1970s, following a crisis in the steel industry, Frederick William had to sell some of the family property to support the H√ºttenwerke Laucherthal (English: Laucherthal Steel Works). Since the death of his wife Margarita in 1996, Prince Frederick William lived on a country estate in Jagdschloss Josefslust between Krauchenwies and Sigmaringen. His son and heir, Karl Friedrich, lives in the Sommerschloss (Summer Palace) in Krauchenwies. The castle is occupied by the management for the business interests of the prince as well as the museum. Castle site The modern Schloss Sigmaringen owes its current size and appearance to three construction periods. * The medieval castle from the 11th to 13th centuries, built under the Counts of Sigmaringen-Spitzenberg and Spitzenberg-Helfenstein. * The renovations and expansion of the castle under Counts of Werdenberg. * The renovations to make the castle into a princely residence for the Princes of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen =Fortress and protective walls= Inner courtyard of the castle, the Buckel Stones from the first castle are visible on the far wall The first castle at Sigmaringen dated from around 1200 and was built from Buckel Stones (squared off stones with a rounded outer surface). The original castle was fully absorbed into the later constructions. Built on the eastern side of the rock hill, it was one of the best protected castles in Germany during the Middle Ages. The original castle was with the central keep being in size. The flat and therefore threatened west side was protected by a moat and a high keep. The square western keep was in size. The foundations of the castle were between thick. The, originally, four story keep walls taper slightly to between thick. The walls are built in the buckel stone style out of a mixture of limestone and Nagelfluh, a conglomerate rock found in the area. The keep could be entered through a nearly high entrance on the courtyard side. To the north of the keep, next to the wall tower, is the castle gate with a gatehouse. The wide and high castle gate was built as a semi-circular entrance with rounded stones and soldiers carved as capitals on the columns. Currently, the castle gate is located at the upper end of the steeply inclined entry hall. The flat top of the hill was surrounded by a curtain wall. From the original fortified house with its blind arches and enclosed kitchen, located on the highest point of the cliff, the arches and portions of the wall are still visible in the outer wall. On the southside, about below the keep, a wide inner courtyard was located. Today this area is occupied by the Hall of Weapons. On the east side near the mill is a small wide opening in the wall, which was most likely a lower castle gate. The high outer curtain wall is the foundation of the modern castle building. In the north inner wall of the keep is a small opening, which likely was a hidden passage leading to the Danube. Sights The castle rooms on the tour are full of ornate furniture, paintings and valuable porcelain objects. The rooms give the visitor a taste of the lifestyle of the nobility in previous centuries. Collections of pre- and ancient historical objects are on display as well as works from swabian artists, carvers and metalworkers. The Hall of Weapons displays one of the largest private weapon collections in Europe, covering everything from the Middle Ages to modern times. The Marstall museum contains the princely fleet of carriages. =The weapon collection= A suit of armor on display in the Schloss The weapon collection in Schloss Sigmaringen contains over 3000 different examples of weapons and armor.House of Hohenzollern website-Schloss Sigmaringen Prince Karl Anton's passion for collecting weapons resulted in the creation of this collection. The collection shows the evolution of weapons from the 14th century to the 20th century. In addition to weapons, the collection also includes protective items such as shields, armor and handguns. Particularly noteworthy are such rare objects dating from the 15th century as a German multi-barrel gun, a body shield and a richly engraved helmet once belonging to a royal bodyguard from ca.1622. The collection includes not just European weapons but also weapons that were considered exotic, such as Persian weapons and the full equipment of a Japanese Samurai. In the Galeriebau (English: Gallery Building), built from 1862 to 1867 under Prince Karl Anton, west of the castle is a collection of medieval torture instruments. The torture chamber with its instruments illustrates an earlier sense of justice. =Pre and Ancient History Collection= In addition to the torture museum, the Galeriebau also houses a Pre and Ancient history museum. The collections give a picture of life from the Stone Age until the end of the Merovingian dynasty (10.000 B.C. until 700 A.D.). It also includes artifacts from the Roman settlements around Sigmaringen. Karl Anton wasn't just fascinated by weapons and hunting, he also loved history and archeology. In 1881 during construction of a canal in the Sigmaringen Market Square, Roman pottery shards and iron work were found. This discovery excited Karl Anton, and he ordered a member of the court F. A. von Lehner to search for and archeologically explore the Villa Rustica in the area. Finds from this Roman estate as well as other nearby estates are including in the collection. =Marstallmuseum= Manual firefighting pump located in the Marstall Museum Located south west of the castle is the royal stables (German: Marstall). The building now houses the Marstallmuseum, a collection of princely carriages. Carriages, coaches, sleds and sedan chairs are presented in an open building. Additionally, equipment for the horses including saddles, horse shoes and spurs, are on display in the museum. One of the exhibits, a manual firefighting pump dates back to the fire in the castle in 1893. The fire raged for three days because the connections on the modern firefighting equipment didn't match the castle's connections. Water had to be brought up by a human chain in buckets from the Danube to the castle. Visiting the castle The castle may only be visited as part of a tour. The tours are in German only, though translated guides are available. The castle is open in March and April from 9:30 am ‚Äì 4:30 pm, May to October from 9:00 am ‚Äì 5:00 pm, and November to February from 10:00 am ‚Äì 3:30 pm.

He is also known for leading a British squadron up the River Ems in 1758, leading directly to the Capture of Emden. Early life Holmes was the fourth son of Colonel Henry Holmes, governor of the Isle of Wight, and his maternal grandfather had been Admiral Sir Robert Holmes, one of England's most noted naval leaders during the Anglo-Dutch Wars of the previous century who had overseen Holmes' Bonfire. Joining the navy at the age of 16, he was promoted to lieutenant in 1734 and received his first command in 1741. In 1747 Holmes was given command of HMS Lenox, one of the biggest warships in the navy, but peace was signed the following year and he would serve for the next few years in British waters. Seven Years' War When the Seven Years' War broke out, he was commanding HMS Grafton, and was sent under Admiral Holburne to reinforce Admiral Boscawen's force in the Atlantic, assisting in the interception of a French squadron bound for North America and the capture of the Alcide and the Lys in April 1755. In 1758 Holmes was sent as Commodore of a small squadron (two frigates, a cutter and a bomb ketch) to the Ems where, despite one of the frigates running aground in the river and having to be sent home, he succeeded in capturing Emden from the French. Soon afterwards he was promoted to rear admiral, and the following year was appointed third-in-command under Admiral Saunders of the naval expedition up the St Lawrence river to besiege Quebec, his flagship being HMS Lowestoffe. He succeeded in getting a squadron of ships and troop transports past the French batteries, and was therefore able to put Wolfe and his troops ashore beyond the city, safely and in absolute silence, allowing its eventual capture after the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. In March 1760, Holmes was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Jamaica Station,Cundall, p. xx during his time there his fleet destroyed a French convoy in the Windward Passage in October 1760. Holmes died in Jamaica in November 1761. There is a memorial to him in Westminster Abbey. Holmes was elected Member of Parliament for Newport, Isle of Wight in 1758, and held the seat until his death three years later. (Two of his brothers, General Henry Holmes and Thomas Holmes were also MPs for Isle of Wight constituencies.) He was also a member of the court martial that tried and condemned Admiral Byng in 1757. He was a known patron of brothel keeper Jane Douglas.

It was built between the towns of Kovrov and Murom in 1874-1880. Steam locomotive type L in Murom Overview The Murom Railway, 107 km, was opened officially on January 1, 1880, and operated from the beginning by the Nizhnyi Novgorod Railway with 13 locomotives, of which eight (class V) were built at state owned Votkin Works in 1877 - 1878, located at Votkinsk. The five class B locomotives were built by Schwartzkopff Werke (formerly L.Schwartzkopff) in Berlin, Germany in 1878. The ten kilometre extension was built in 1885, when the line was taken over by the state. The Murom Railway connected Nizhnyi Novgorod railway with private Moscow - Kazan Railway making both Murom and Kovrov, important railway junctions. After its construction, up to 80% of goods from Kovrov were bound for the Nizhny Novgorod Fair through the Moscow-Nizhny Novgorod Railway. The Murom Railway was merged into the Moscow - Kursk and Nizhnyi Novgorod Railway complex in 1893. Traffic The Murom Railway favored trade growth and Moscow's bread supply and provided metal and forest for Central Russia. In the early 20th century, Murom received cement, yarn, and manufactured goods. Rolling stock The rolling stock of the Murom Railway included thirteen steam locomotives (eight of them from the Votkin Factory, the other five from a German company named Schwartzkopff) and 300 cars. Rolling stock maintenance and repairs were done at railway repair shops at the Murom railway station. Also, they built a three small locomotive depots and car sheds in Kovrov, Selivanovo, and Murom. Track replacement In 1872-1882, the Murom Railway was owned by a joint stock company. In 1888, they began a complete replacement of iron rails with the Russian-made steel rails made in nearby located Kulebak Iron Works. Merger and nationalization In 1895, the Murom Railway was merged with the Moscow-Nizhny Novgorod and Moscow-Kursk Railways. In May 1918, all of the Russian railways were nationalized and transferred under the authority of the People's Commissariat for Communications (–ù–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω—ã–π –ö–æ–º–∏—Å—Å–∞—Ä–∏–∞—Ç –ü—É—Ç–µ–π –°–æ–æ–±—â–µ–Ω–∏—è).

He served as Canada's first High Commissioner to Australia from 1939 to 1941 and as Canada's first and last High Commissioner to the Dominion of Newfoundland serving from 1941 to 1944 and again from 1948 to 1949.Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada Complete List of Posts Burchell also raised the possibility of the island, which was then ruled by a British appointed Commission of Government, might join Canadian Confederation following the war. He \\"quietly sounded out prominent St. John's citizens on Confederation and quietly encouraged St. John's lawyer John McEvoy to promote publicly Confederation between the two countries.\\" Burchell concluded that the restoration of responsible government by Britain may have to occur before the island would consider joining Canada. Early life Charles Jost Burchell was born in Sydney, Nova Scotia on 1 July 1876. He attended Sydney Academy and Dalhousie University, read law, and was admitted to the Nova Scotia bar in Apri 1899. He married E. Gertrude Currie on 8 May 1901, and they had four children. Diplomatic career Jost's initial term as High Commissioner was from 1941 to 1944 when he was succeeded by James Macdonald. However, he would serve a second sojourn from 1948 to 1949. The mission remained following the war in order to deal with the withdrawal of American troops, negotiate a 99-year lease for a Canadian military airbase at Goose Bay and, ultimately, to negotiate Newfoundland's entry into Canadian Confederation following the 1948 Newfoundland referendums. Burchell was sent back to Newfoundland in 1948 in order to negotiate the British colony's terms of union with Canada. The High Commission was closed on March 31, 1949, shortly before Newfoundland officially became a Canadian province. On April 1, 1949, Buchell was named to the Queen's Privy Council for Canada in recognition of his work as High Commissioner. Death Charles Jost Burchell died at his home in Halifax on 14 August 1967.

Continuing with their outrageous sexually-explicit, always tongue-in- cheek, often humorous lyrical themes, Lust had earned positive reviews from music critics, both in and out of the dance music community.

Properties A rational consequence relation \\\\vdash satisfies: :; REF : Reflexivity \\\\theta \\\\vdash \\\\theta and the so-called Gabbay-Makinson rules: :; LLE : Left Logical Equivalence \\\\frac{\\\\theta \\\\vdash \\\\psi \\\\quad \\\\theta \\\\equiv \\\\phi}{\\\\phi \\\\vdash \\\\psi} :; RWE : Right-hand weakening \\\\frac{\\\\theta \\\\vdash \\\\phi \\\\quad \\\\phi \\\\models \\\\psi}{\\\\theta \\\\vdash \\\\psi} :; CMO : Cautious monotonicity \\\\frac{\\\\theta \\\\vdash \\\\phi \\\\quad \\\\theta \\\\vdash \\\\psi}{\\\\theta \\\\wedge \\\\psi \\\\vdash \\\\phi} :; DIS : Logical or (ie disjunction) on left hand side \\\\frac{\\\\theta \\\\vdash \\\\psi \\\\quad \\\\phi \\\\vdash \\\\psi}{\\\\theta \\\\vee \\\\phi \\\\vdash \\\\psi} :; AND : Logical and on right hand side \\\\frac{\\\\theta \\\\vdash \\\\phi \\\\quad \\\\theta \\\\vdash \\\\psi}{\\\\theta \\\\vdash \\\\phi \\\\wedge \\\\psi} :; RMO : Rational monotonicity \\\\frac{\\\\phi ot\\\\vdash eg\\\\theta \\\\quad \\\\phi \\\\vdash \\\\psi}{\\\\phi \\\\wedge \\\\theta \\\\vdash \\\\psi} Uses The rational consequence relation is non-monotonic, and the relation \\\\theta \\\\vdash \\\\phi is intended to carry the meaning theta usually implies phi or phi usually follows from theta. In this sense it is more useful for modeling some everyday situations than a monotone consequence relation because the latter relation models facts in a more strict boolean fashion - something either follows under all circumstances or it does not. =Example= The statement \\"If a cake contains sugar then it tastes good\\" implies under a monotone consequence relation the statement \\"If a cake contains sugar and soap then it tastes good.\\" Clearly this doesn't match our own understanding of cakes. By asserting \\"If a cake contains sugar then it usually tastes good\\" a rational consequence relation allows for a more realistic model of the real world, and certainly it does not automatically follow that \\"If a cake contains sugar and soap then it usually tastes good.\\" Note that if we also have the information \\"If a cake contains sugar then it usually contains butter\\" then we may legally conclude (under CMO) that \\"If a cake contains sugar and butter then it usually tastes good.\\". Equally in the absence of a statement such as \\"If a cake contains sugar then usually it contains no soap\\" then we may legally conclude from RMO that \\"If the cake contains sugar and soap then it usually tastes good.\\" If this latter conclusion seems ridiculous to you then it is likely that you are subconsciously asserting your own preconceived knowledge about cakes when evaluating the validity of the statement. That is, from your experience you know that cakes which contain soap are likely to taste bad so you add to the system your own knowledge such as \\"Cakes which contain sugar do not usually contain soap.\\", even though this knowledge is absent from it. If the conclusion seems silly to you then you might consider replacing the word soap with the word eggs to see if it changes your feelings. =Example= Consider the sentences: *Young people are usually happy *Drug abusers are usually not happy *Drug abusers are usually young We may consider it reasonable to conclude: *Young drug abusers are usually not happy This would not be a valid conclusion under a monotonic deduction system (omitting of course the word 'usually'), since the third sentence would contradict the first two. In contrast the conclusion follows immediately using the Gabbay- Makinson rules: applying the rule CMO to the last two sentences yields the result. Consequences The following consequences follow from the above rules: :;MP : Modus ponens \\\\frac{\\\\theta \\\\vdash \\\\phi \\\\quad \\\\theta \\\\vdash \\\\left( \\\\phi \\\\rightarrow \\\\psi \\\\right)}{\\\\theta \\\\vdash \\\\psi} ::MP is proved via the rules AND and RWE. :;CON : Conditionalisation \\\\frac{\\\\theta \\\\wedge \\\\phi \\\\vdash \\\\psi}{\\\\theta \\\\vdash \\\\left(\\\\phi \\\\rightarrow \\\\psi \\\\right)} :;CC : Cautious Cut \\\\frac{\\\\theta \\\\vdash \\\\phi \\\\quad \\\\theta \\\\wedge \\\\phi \\\\vdash \\\\psi}{\\\\theta \\\\vdash \\\\psi} ::The notion of Cautious Cut simply encapsulates the operation of conditionalisation, followed by MP. It may seem redundant in this sense, but it is often used in proofs so it is useful to have a name for it to act as a shortcut. :;SCL : Supraclassity \\\\frac{\\\\theta \\\\models \\\\phi}{\\\\theta \\\\vdash \\\\phi} ::SCL is proved trivially via REF and RWE. Rational consequence relations via atom preferences Let L = \\\\\\\\{p_1, \\\\ldots , p_n\\\\\\\\} be a finite language. An atom is a formula of the form \\\\bigwedge_{i=1}^n p^\\\\epsilon_i (where p^1 = p and p^{-1} = eg p). Notice that there is a unique valuation which makes any given atom true (and conversely each valuation satisfies precisely one atom). Thus an atom can be used to represent a preference about what we believe ought to be true. Let At^L be the set of all atoms in L. For \\\\theta \\\\in SL, define S_\\\\theta = \\\\\\\\{\\\\alpha \\\\in At^L  \\\\alpha \\\\models^{SC} \\\\theta \\\\\\\\}. Let \\\\vec{s} = s_1, \\\\ldots , s_m be a sequence of subsets of At^L. For \\\\theta, \\\\phi in SL, let the relation \\\\vdash_\\\\vec{s} be such that \\\\theta \\\\vdash_{\\\\vec{s}} \\\\phi if one of the following holds: #S_\\\\theta \\\\cap s_i = \\\\emptyset for each 1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq m #S_\\\\theta \\\\cap s_i eq \\\\emptyset for some 1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq m and for the least such i, S_\\\\theta \\\\cap s_i \\\\subseteq S_\\\\phi. Then the relation \\\\vdash_\\\\vec{s} is a rational consequence relation. This may easily be verified by checking directly that it satisfies the GM-conditions. The idea behind the sequence of atom sets is that the earlier sets account for the most likely situations such as \\"young people are usually law abiding\\" whereas the later sets account for the less likely situations such as \\"young joyriders are usually not law abiding\\". =Notes= #By the definition of the relation \\\\vdash_\\\\vec{s}, the relation is unchanged if we replace s_2 with s_2 \\\\setminus s_1, s_3 with s_3 \\\\setminus s_2 \\\\setminus s_1 ... and s_m with s_m \\\\setminus \\\\bigcup_{i=1}^{m-1} s_i.

Today it is most often seen in the Czech Republic, Austria, Romania, the former Yugoslavian countries, Poland, Germany, and Hungary, but has been exported to other nations and is bred around the world. A purebred Shagya Arabian today has bloodlines that can be traced in all lines to the stud books of RƒÉdƒÉu»õi, Babolna, and Topolcianky. The breed is considered by some to be a subtype of Arabian horse, but due to the presence of a small amount of non-Arabian breeding others consider it to be an Anglo- Arabian or a partbred Arabian.  Origin  Statue of Shagya at Babolna One of the major founding sires was Shagya, a gray Arabian\\"The Other Arabian Horse\\" Arabian Horse World, April, 1983. scanned article at (or, some say part- Arabian) stallion with some ancestors of the Kehilan and Siglavy strains. Born in Syria in 1810, he was taller than the average Arabian of the time, standing at the withers. He was mostly used for crossbreeding at Babolna, bred few pure-blooded or asil Arabian mares, and thus has no pure Arabian descendants today.http://www.shagya-araber.info/shagya-line.htm \\"Pure Bred Shagya-Araber Society International\\" Many of the Arabian stallions standing at Babolna and other studs were crossbred with mares who already possessed a great deal of Arabian influence due to the long Turkish occupation of Eastern Europe. Some Thoroughbreds and Lipizzans were also used. In all cases, meticulous pedigree records were kept. Originally, these predominantly, but not asil Arabian horses were referred to by the generic term Araberrasse (Arab \\"race\\" or breed, indicating predominantly Arabian ancestry) but this was changed after the second World War to Shagya by hippologist Dr. Gramazky because he was worried the non-purebred descendants of Shagya would be mixed up with the purebred Arabian horses that were also produced in Hungary. At the time, this name was chosen since Shagya was in virtually every pedigree as an ancestor, though many other Arabian bloodlines are also a part of the Shagya breed. Bloodlines The purebred Arabian stallion Jasir, who also appears in many Shagya pedigrees. Carl Raswan photo, 1912 While Shagyas are not considered \\"pure\\" or asil Arabians, they have a closed stud book and have special status within the World Arabian Horse Organization (WAHO). In 1978, WAHO stated that Shagya Arabians that have been bred pure after the system of Babolna and Topolcianky may be termed \\"purebred Shagya Arabians\\", and the Shagya breeders' organisation is under WAHO patronage as associate members, allowed to use the WAHO emblem. However, WAHO also was clear that \\"purebred\\" in this case means that the horses have been bred pure among themselves and are not to be confused with the term \\"purebred Arabian\\". Some aficionados note that the meticulous recordkeeping of the Hungarian studs actually has produced horses with longer and more complete pedigrees than some horses accepted as purebred Arabians by mainstream registries. However, despite this argument, Shagyas remain a distinct bloodline group and are generally not accepted as pure- blooded Arabians.WAHO, Purebred Arabian horse definition, 2007 A young Shagya Arabian  Traits  The Shagya Arabian exhibits traits similar to the asil or purebred Arabian horse, with high carried tail, sound bone and excellent endurance. However, due to the small influx of non-Arabian breeding and the breeding goals of the Hungarian studs, Shagyas tend to be taller, less refined, and bigger-boned than purebred Arabians; the modern Shagya is usually at least 15 hands tall and commonly 16 hands, whereas the breed standard for the Arabian ranges from 14.1 to 15.1 hands, with some individuals over and under that height.

Cricket ground The ground has been used for cricket since the early 19th century. Essex County Cricket Club played their first game there on 15 and 16 June 1885 against Surrey; the game was lost by an innings. The captain of Essex, Charles Ernest Green, became convinced that the club's headquarters ground at Brentwood was too small and he drove the campaign to acquire the Leyton ground.Lemmon, David and Marshall, Mike (1987), Essex County Cricket Club: The Official History, Kingwood Press, (pp. 55-56) In 1886, the club purchased the ground from its owner, the cricket-loving Lord Lyttelton, at a \\"favourable\\" price of ¬£12,000. An appeal was launched for ¬£3,500 for the construction of a pavilion, other necessary buildings and \\"general alterations\\". Lord Lyttelton was the first donor, contributing ¬£200. Initially known as the \\"Lyttelton Ground\\", a local newspaper report claimed that the development of the site \\"gave unwonted loveliness to a district which but a short while since presented an appearance of the abomination of desolation\\", since the surrounding area had been sold off for the construction of new housing and a railway line.Lemmon p.58 Although ¬£2,900 had been raised by the appeal, the purchase of the Leyton Cricket Ground left the club in financial difficulty for decades.Lemmon p.60 In 1921, the ground was sold to the Army Sports Central Board, relieving the club of a ¬£10,000 mortgage.Lemmon p.379 Leyton Cricket Ground remained the headquarters of Essex County Cricket Club until 1933, when the lease expired and the club moved to the County Cricket Ground, Chelmsford, for the 1934 season. Essex returned to play matches at Leyton in 1957, by then owned by the local council, and continued to play there until 1977. Essex are considering the possibility of playing some Twenty20 Cup games back at the ground. The ground is now used as a sports ground by local schools and community groups. A local cricket club, Leyton County Cricket Club, uses the ground for first team games during the summer. The wooden pavilion building still stands and has been a Grade II listed building since 1999. The site is protected by Fields in Trust through a legal \\"Deed of Dedication\\" safeguarding the future of the space as public recreation land for future generations to enjoy. =Notable matches at Leyton= *1899: Essex beat Australia by 126 runs.Lemmon p.377 *1905: Essex beat the touring Australians by 19 runs.Lemmon p.378 *1906: Essex beat the West Indies by 111 runs. *1927: Essex beat New Zealand by five wickets.Lemmon p.378 *1932: Herbert Sutcliffe and Percy Holmes of Yorkshire made a world record first- class partnership for any wicket of 555 at Leyton. This remained the record for any wicket till 1945-6, and it was not until the 1976-7 season in Pakistan that it was beaten for the first wicket. It remains the record for any wicket made in England. *1962: Essex beat Pakistan by nine wickets.Lemmon p.382 Other uses The ground has also been used for football. Millwall Rovers played London Caledonians at the ground in the East London FA Cup Final in 1886. The game finished 2-2 and both teams shared the cup for six months each. In 1895 Woolwich Arsenal played a Football League Second Division game against Leicester Fosse as their own Manor Ground was closed by the Football League following crowd trouble. Leyton also occasionally played there at the ground, prior to moving to Osborne Road.

One of the founding members and also the band's manager, he died in 2001, after being hit by a motorcycle while jogging.  Early life and youth  Marcelo Fromer grew up in S√£o Paulo in a house frequently visited by friends like Branco Mello, who he has met in 1974, in the Hugo Sarmento school. When he was 15 years old, he discovered The Beatles, Chico Buarque and the Tropic√°lia, and started having guitar lessons with Luiz Tati, of the group Rumo. While studying at Equipe school, he met Tony Bellotto and formed the Trio Mam√£o. As he hated singing, he was the only one dedicated exclusively to the acoustic guitar. Also at Equipe school, he, Mello and other classmates created the \\"Papagaio\\" magazine, featuring comics, poetry and texts about the internal decisions of the school. But he would never stop composing and playing. But music was not the only passion of Fromer. Soccer would also play an important role on his life. Trusty supporter of S√£o Paulo, he managed to train for the young team of the club. Once he finished school, he entered Linguistics at USP together with Mello, but both quit it two years later.  Works with Tit√£s  In 1981, Tit√£s made their first performance (under the name Tit√£s do I√™-I√™) at the event ‚ÄúA Idade da Pedra Jovem‚Äù. Fromer became a little excited and decided to play the electric guitar like an acoustic one, without a pick. At the end of the night, his fingers were seriously injured and there was blood at his white Giannini. In 1984, with the releasing of Tit√£s first album, Fromer showed that he could also do outstanding works as a businessman, and he was chosen to be the manager the band. Shows, contracts, and all the bureaucratic decisions of the band would be carefully revised and negotiated by him. Another passion of Fromer, which appeared mostly during the first tours of the band, was the gastronomy. He would always choose the restaurants were the group should eat throughout the country. This passion would be clearly cited at the song As Aventuras Do Guitarrista Gourmet Atr√°s Da Refei√ß√£o Ideal, featured at Como Est√£o Voc√™s?. His \\"business-gourmet\\" life would join each other at Rock Dog (word play with Hot Dog), a snack bar specialized in hot dogs that he opened in 1989, in S√£o Paulo, with the partnership of his brothers Thiago and Cuca, and the band members Mello and Bellotto. In 2000, he became partner of the Campana, a Pizza shop also located in S√£o Paulo. A year before, he showed his gastronomy skills at the book ‚ÄúVoc√™ Tem Fome de Qu√™?‚Äù, in which he listed cookery recipes from many restaurants of Brazil, along with tablatures and curiosities of Tit√£s main hits.

On June 11, 2001, a day before the start of the recording of the band's 13th album,A Melhor Banda de Todos os Tempos da √öltima Semana, Fromer was crossing Europa Avenue in southern S√£o Paulo when a red Honda CG125 motorcycle, driven by Erasmo Castro da Costa Jr., struck him. Erasmo called an ambulance, but fled the scene when the police arrived, as his driving license was no longer valid. Two days later, Fromer died in hospital. Presumably, his head struck Erasmo's helmet. In July 2002, Erasmo was found by the police. He stated he did not know the man he struck was Fromer until his death. He also alleged that Fromer was to blame for the accident, as there was a crosswalk 15 meters away; Fromer decided to cross the avenue between the cars, making it impossible for Erasmo to see Fromer. Fromer's family authorized the donation of his organs. His heart, liver, pancreas, kidneys, and his corneas were all donated. On September 7, 2001, a skyway named after him was inaugurated over Avenida Juscelino Kubitschek, in S√£o Paulo.  Personal life  Fromer lived in S√£o Paulo. His first marriage with Martha Locatelli Fromer brought along his first child, Susy. His second marriage to Ana Cristina Martinelli, also known as \\"Tina\\", resulted in the birth of children Alice and Max.

His niece was Emperor Gaozong's first wife Empress Wang, and as Emperor Gaozong's favors for her waned, Liu found himself in a precarious position. in 654, he resigned his chancellor post, but was not able to escape being exiled in 655 when Empress Wang was deposed and killed, in favor of Empress Wu. In 659, as part of a campaign of Empress Wu's attempt to take vengeance on anyone who opposed her ascension, Emperor Gaozong issued an edict to have Liu executed.  Background  It is not known when Liu Shi was born. His family was from Pu Prefecture (Ëí≤Â∑û, roughly modern Yuncheng, Shanxi). His father Liu Ze (Êü≥Ââá) had served as an imperial guard commander during Sui Dynasty and died while serving as an emissary to Goguryeo. It was said that Liu Shi went to Goguryeo to retrieve his father's body, and his mournfulness impressed the people of Goguryeo. His uncle Liu Heng (Êü≥‰∫®) served as an official under Tang Dynasty's first three emperors, Emperor Gaozu, Emperor Taizong, and Emperor Gaozong. Not much, however, was recorded about Liu Shi's career prior to 651.  During Emperor Gaozong's reign  In 651, Emperor Gaozong, whose wife Empress Wang was a niece of Liu Shi's, gave Liu Shi, who was then serving as Zhongshu Shilang (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰æçÈÉé) -- the deputy head of the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng) -- the additional designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Sanpin (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ã‰∏âÂìÅ), making him a chancellor de facto. In 652, Emperor Gaozong further promoted him to the post of Zhongshu Ling (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰ª§) -- the head of the legislative bureau and a post considered one for a chancellor. Empress Wang was sonless, and Liu suggested to her that she should request that Emperor Gaozong's oldest son, Li Zhong, whose mother Consort Liu was of low birth, be created crown prince, so that Li Zhong would be grateful to her. Empress Wang did so, and Emperor Gaozong agreed, after Liu Shi lobbied his fellow chancellors, including Emperor Gaozong's powerful uncle Zhangsun Wuji. Later in 652, Emperor Gaozong created Li Zhong crown prince. By 654, however, Emperor Gaozong's favors for Empress Wang had waned, particularly in light of his increasing favor for his concubine Consort Wu. The situation was exacerbated by the fact that Empress Wang was not good at earning the loyalty of the other concubines and the ladies in waiting, while Consort Wu was able to, and also that Liu Shi and his sister and Empress Wang's mother Lady Liu were not respectful to the other concubines. In 654, in fear, Liu requested to be relieved of his chancellor post, and Emperor Gaozong agreed, making him the minister of civil service, no longer a chancellor. In 655, Consort Wu falsely accused Empress Wang and Lady Liu of using witchcraft to try to regain favor for Empress Wang. In response, Emperor Gaozong barred Lady Liu from the palace and demoted Liu out of the capital Chang'an to be the prefect of Sui Prefecture (ÈÅÇÂ∑û, roughly modern Suining, Sichuan). As he travelled through Qi Prefecture (Â≤êÂ∑û, roughly modern Baoji, Shaanxi), the prefectural secretary general Yu Chengsu (‰∫éÊâøÁ¥†) submitted a report accusing Liu of revealing palace secrets, and Emperor Gaozong further demoted Liu to be the prefect of Rong Prefecture (Ê¶ÆÂ∑û, roughly modern Zigong, Sichuan), a smaller prefecture. Later that year, Emperor Gaozong deposed Empress Wang and replaced her with Consort Wu, and the former Empress Wang was soon executed along with her ally Consort Xiao by order of the new Empress Wu. In 657, Empress Wu's allies Xu Jingzong and Li Yifu further accused the chancellors Han Yuan and Lai Ji, both of whom had opposed Empress Wang's removal and Empress Wu's ascension, of conspiring with the former chancellor Chu Suiliang, who was even more vocal in his opposition and who had been demoted as a result. Han, Lai, and Chu were all demoted to be prefects of distant prefectures, and Liu was also further demoted to be the prefect of the extremely distant Xiang Prefecture (Ë±°Â∑û, roughly modern Laibin, Guangxi). In 659, Empress Wu carried out even more reprisals‚Äîthis time, having Xu falsely accuse Zhangsun, who had shown implicit disapproval of her ascension, of treason, and Chu (who had died at this point), Liu, and Han of encouraging Zhangsun. Zhangsun was exiled (and soon forced to commit suicide), while Liu and Han were demoted to commoner rank. In fall 659, Emperor Gaozong further sent imperial messengers to arrest Liu and Han, as well as Zhangsun Wuji's cousin Zhangsun En (Èï∑Â≠´ÊÅ©), but even while imperial messengers were on the way changed the order to have Liu and Han executed instead. Liu's clan members were exiled to the modern Guangdong and Guangxi region, while his immediately family was specifically confiscated to become servants at Gui Prefecture (Ê°ÇÂ∑û, roughly modern Guilin, Guangxi).  After death  After Emperor Gaozong's death around the new year 684, Empress Wu seized power and eventually declared herself \\"emperor\\" in 690. After Empress Wu's own removal in 705 by her son Emperor Zhongzong, Liu Shi's offices were posthumously restored, and after her death that year, the exile order against Liu's clan members was cancelled. Early in the Kaiyuan era (713-741) of Emperor Zhongzong's nephew Emperor Xuanzong, Liu Shi's grandnephew Liu Huan (Êü≥Ê∏ô) was serving as a mid-level official at the legislative bureau, when he submitted a position pointing out that Liu was wrongly executed and that, while his reputation had been restored, he was still buried a long distance from the capital and that his only surviving descendant, his great-grandson Liu Wutian (Êü≥ÁÑ°Âøù), remained in exile. Emperor Xuanzong issued an edict approving Liu Shi's reburial at his home prefecture Pu Prefecture, and had Liu Wutian escort Liu Shi's casket there. Liu Wutian later served in the imperial administration as the commandant of Tan Prefecture (roughly modern Changsha, Hunan).

The poem was first published in the 1827 collection Tamerlane and Other Poems. That collection, with only 50 copies printed, was not credited with the author's real name but by \\"A Bostonian\\". The poem's original version was 403 lines but trimmed down to 223 lines for its inclusion in Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane, and Minor Poems. Synopsis The poem follows the life of a Turkic conqueror historically known as Tamerlane. The name is a Latinized version of \\"Timur Lenk\\", the 14th-century warlord who founded the Timurid Empire, though the poem is not a historical depiction of his life. Tamerlane ignores the young love he has for a peasant in order to achieve power. On his deathbed, he regrets this decision to create \\"a kingdom [in exchange] for a broken heart\\". The peasant is named Ada in most of Poe's original version of the poem, though it is removed and re-added throughout its many revised versions.Quinn, Arthur Hobson. Edgar Allan Poe: A Critical Biography. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998. p. 124. (\\"Quinn\\"). The name \\"Ada\\" is likely a reference to Ada Lovelace, the daughter of Lord Byron, a renowned poet whom Poe admired. In fact, the line \\"I reach'd my home ‚Äî my home no more\\" echoes a line in Byron's work Don Juan.Silverman, Kenneth. Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance. Harper Perennial, 1991. p. 41 (\\"Silverman\\"). Analysis \\"Tamerlane\\" is the Latinized name of a 14th-century historical figure.

Checkmark Books, 2001. his birth mother Eliza Poe, or his foster-mother Frances Allan. The poem may also mirror Poe's relationship with his foster-father John Allan; similar to Poe, Tamerlane is of uncertain parentage, with a \\"feigned name.\\"Silverman, p. 39. Only 17 when he wrote the poem, Poe's own sense of loss came from the waning possibility of inheritance and a college education after leaving the University of Virginia. Distinctly a poem of youth, the poem also discusses themes Poe will use throughout his life, including his tendency toward self- criticism and his ongoing strivings towards perfection. The poem was influenced by Lord Byron's drama Manfred and his poem The Giaour in both manner and style.Campbell, Killis. \\"The Origins of Poe\\", The Mind of Poe and Other Studies. New York: Russell & Russell, Inc., 1962: 150. Poe may have first heard of Timur in July 1822 as a young man in Richmond, Virginia. A horse-spectacle called Timour the Tartar was staged at the Richmond theatre and repeated in October. Some Poe scholars speculate Poe was in attendance or at least heard of the show.Thomas, Dwight & David K. Jackson. The Poe Log: A Documentary Life of Edgar Allan Poe, 1809‚Äì1849. Boston: G. K. Hall & Co., 1987: 52. . Poe may have identified with the title character. He used \\"TAMERLANE\\" as a pseudonym attached to two of his poems on their first publication, \\"Fanny\\" and \\"To ‚Äî‚Äî\\", both published in the Baltimore Saturday Visiter in 1833. Publication history \\"Tamerlane\\" was first published in Poe's earliest poetry collection, Tamerlane and Other Poems. The \\"little volume\\", as Poe referred to it in the preface, consists of 10 poems.Silverman, p. 38‚Äì39. This original version of the poem contained 406 lines. In an 1845 publication, it had been edited to only two hundred and thirty-four. Tamerlane and Other Poems, which appeared in June 1827, was forty pages long and credited only by \\"a Bostonian\\".Silverman, p. 38. In its initial publication in the collection Tamerlane and Other Poems, Poe included endnotes explaining some of his allusions from \\"Tamerlane\\". He also confesses early on that he knows little about the historical Tamerlane, \\"and with that little, I have taken the full liberty of a poet.\\" These endnotes do not appear in any other collection that includes \\"Tamerlane\\". In 1829, between the poem's first and second publications, Poe sent it along with \\"Al Aaraaf\\" for review by influential critic John Neal in his magazine The Yankee. In recognition of Neal's encouragement, Poe expressed desire to dedicate Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane, and Minor Poems to him, but Neal insisted such a dedication would be an injury to both Poe and the publication. Poe instead dedicated just \\"Tamerlane\\" within the volume to Neal.

The district includes part of Blainville, as well as a few other small cities. It was created for the 1981 election from a part of the Terrebonne electoral district. In the change from the 2001 to the 2011 electoral map, it gained a small part of the city of Blainville from the Blainville electoral district; it did not previously include any part of that city. In the change from the 2011 to 2017 electoral map, the riding will lose the Saint-R√©dempteur neighbourhood of Blainville to the riding of Blainville. From its creation in 1981 until 2007, Groulx was a bellwether riding always sending a member from the governing party to the National Assembly. Since the ADQ breakthrough in the suburbs of Montreal in 2007, the riding has been targeted by all major parties and is part of a collection of ridings that determine Quebec elections. The riding is overwhelmingly francophone and white, and has a strong nationalist undercurrent, making it a battleground riding between the Parti Quebecois, ADQ/CAQ, and the Quebec Liberals. In 2014, the PQ nominated Martine Desjardins, former leader of the FEUQ during the 2012 student strike. She was seen as a star candidate. While the PQ began the campaign with a strong lead among francophones and heavily targeted CAQ-held ridings such as Groulx, the fall of the PQ and rise of the CAQ during the last two weeks of the campaign kept this riding in the hands of the CAQ, albeit in a tight 3-way split with no candidate receiving more than 31% of the vote.

The band identified with the straight edge, anarchist, vegan, crust punk, cyclist and thrashcore movements. Known for hectic live performances, the band toured extensively in the United States, Europe, Australia and Southeast Asia, including several sections of the latter continent previously unvisited by touring Western rock bands. History R.A.M.B.O. was formed in 1999 by singer Tony Croasdale (known as Tony Pointless), guitarist Andy Wheeler, bassist Beau Brendley and drummer Jeremy Gewertz, the latter two of whom played in Philadelphia-based hardcore band Kill The Man Who Questions. Croasdale was known in the city's punk rock scene for his involvement with the underground venue Stalag 13, and would later co-run a summer music fest that became unofficially known as the Pointless Fest. Initially, the group performed in camouflage face paint and military fatigue, but following the events of 9/11, ceased this policy in fear of its presenting \\"the wrong\\" (i.e., a pro-American militancy) message. In 2000, Brendley and Gewertz left the group. Gewertz would go on to play with An Albatross, Brendley with El Toro de Oro. They were replaced by Bull Gervasi (formerly of Policy Of Three) and Todd Hoffman (of Virginia Black Lung and the Fighting Dogs), respectively; the lineup was rounded out by second guitarist John Robinson (a former member of Good Clean Fun).

Early life Capobianco was born in La Plata, Argentina. His parents had fled from Fascist Italy in 1928 and settled in La Plata, near Buenos Aires. His parents were both musical; his father played trumpet in the local symphonic band. He grew up speaking Italian (a later advantage in the opera world) and attended a bilingual Spanish-Italian school until 4th grade. He continued his musical education at Hermanos Maristas de la Ense√±anza and St. Joseph's College. He then qualified for the chorus and opera school of the Teatro Argentino de La Plata where he graduated from being a super to singing baritone roles and also learned stage managing. Career He made his official debut with Aida at the Teatro Argentino de La Plata in 1953, then worked at the Teatro Col√≥n in Buenos Aires. His American debut came in 1962 with a production of Tosca at the Philadelphia Grand Opera Company with Birgit Nilsson in the title role.

Summary The poem is a bridal song about a man who overcomes his sadness by marrying the beautiful Eulalie.Sova, Dawn B. Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z. Checkmark Books, 2001.

Analysis The poem uses Poe's frequent theme of \\"the death of a beautiful woman,\\" which he considered to be \\"the most poetical topic in the world.\\"Poe, Edgar Allan. \\"The Philosophy of Composition\\" (1846). The use of this theme has often been suggested to be autobiographical by Poe critics and biographers, stemming from the repeated loss of women throughout Poe's life, including his mother Eliza Poe and his foster mother Frances Allan.Weekes, Karen. \\"Poe's feminine ideal,\\" collected in The Cambridge Companion to Edgar Allan Poe, edited by Kevin J. Hayes. Cambridge University Press, 2002. p. 149. If autobiographical, \\"Eulalie\\" may be referring to Poe's relationship with his wife Virginia.

After Virginia's death in 1847, Poe scribbled on a manuscript copy of \\"Eulalie\\" a couplet, now known as \\"Deep in Earth.\\"Silverman, Kenneth. Edgar A.

He was the son of Reginaldo degli Scrovegni and Capellina Malacapelli, and was married twice, first to a member of the Carrara family, then to Jacopina (Giacomina) d'Este, daughter of Francesco d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara. He may have been a member of the Cavalieri Gaudenti. Enrico is most famous as the patron of Giotto, commissioning the great painter to paint the famous Scrovegni Chapel, c.1303-5, which he also commissioned. There is a tradition that he hired Giotto to atone for the sin of usury, although there is debate about whether this idea has any foundation. Dante placed his father in the Seventh Circle of Hell for his notoriously ill-gotten gains, and Enrico himself was a moneylender on a grand scale; it is these facts that have given rise to the tradition. Against the idea that he founded the chapel as an act of atonement may be cited the fact that it was a very sumptuous commission for his own personal use, attached to the grand palace that he built for himself. In 1320 Enrico Scrovegni fled the wars and civil strife that plagued Padua at the time, and settled in Venice. He was formally banished from Padua in 1328, and died in Venice in 1336.Laura Jacobus 'Giotto and the Arena Chapel: Art, Architecture and Experience' (Turnhout and New York: Brepols/Harvey Miller, 2008); for the portrait statue: C.

Born at Pavia, he studied law and theology at Bologna under Gandulphus and Faventinus. Later, he was provost of the cathedral of Pavia until 1191, Bishop of Faenza until 1198, and then Bishop of Pavia until his death there in 1213. Papiensis' very extensive works on the canon law helped elevate canon law to a legal system in its own right, taught at universities, that was recognised to change over time. In particular, Papiensis is renowned for his \\"Breviarium extravagantium\\" (later called \\"Compilatio prima antiqua\\"), a collection of canonical texts comprising ancient canons not inserted in the \\"Decretum\\" of Gratian and also later documents. The work was compiled between 1187 and 1191, and was edited by Friedberg (Quinque compilationes antiqu√¶, 1882). Papiensis is the author of a \\"Summa\\" on his own compilation, which he wrote while Bishop of Faenza; it was edited by Laspeyres, as were also other works of the same author: Summa de matrimonio, Summa de electione, Casus decretalium, and a gloss on his Breviarium extravagantium (Bernardi Papiensis Summa decretalium, 1861).

It is long and flows out from the Greifensee through the Glatt Valley, discharging into the Rhine by Glattfelden. Whereas the upper reaches are only gently inclined, the stream gets steeper beneath, forming banks of bed load. The earliest mention of the Glatt (fluvii, qui dicitur glat) dates to 1034. The hydronym reflects the (feminine) OHG adjective glat, meaning either \\"bright, clear\\" or \\"plane, smooth\\".Gabrielle Schmid/Andres Kristol, Niederglatt ZH (Dielsdorf) in: Dictionnaire toponymique des communes suisses ‚Äì Lexikon der schweizerischen Gemeindenamen ‚Äì Dizionario toponomastico dei comuni svizzeri (DTSLSG), Centre de dialectologie, Universit√© de Neuch√¢tel, Verlag Huber, Frauenfeld/Stuttgart/Wien 2005, and √âditions Payot, Lausanne 2005, , p. 646. Since the 15th century, the Glatt had been subject to the sovereignty of the city of Zurich, the council of which assigned the custody over the river to two reeves (Glattv√∂gte) in the 16th century. After a first attempt to regulate the stream in 1593 and a rudimentary project in the early 19th century, the largest reshapings took place during the time from 1878 to 1895. In 1936, another straightening was carried out as a preliminary work to the construction of the Zurich Airport as well as to land improvement and future overbuilding. Due to the last regulation works in 1975 between Niederglatt and the Glatt's confluence to the Rhine, the hydroelectric power stations built in the late 19th century at the lower course of the stream disappeared. The Glatt was formerly abounding with fish. Owing to the accelerated growth of Zurich's agglomeration during the 20th century and the insufficiency of the purification plants built in the 1960s, it has been strongly polluted; from 1994 to 2002, the sewage system was restructured by driving a tunnel between the Glatt Valley and the Limmat Valley.

Born in Wales, he wrote in English. Biography Jones was born at Cwm Crogau, near Llanafan Fawr in Brecknockshire (Powys), Wales. Jones was the son of a road worker and a servant girl. His grandfather, a shepherd, predicted at his birth, that Jones would become a poet. Jones studied English at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth. But his studies were interrupted in 1941 when, during World War II, he volunteered for the Royal Navy. Jones served until 1946. He graduated in 1947 and gained a Master of Arts degree in 1949. From 1951 to 1959 he taught in Portsmouth, Hampshire and during this period wrote The Enemy in the Heart (1957). In 1959 Jones accepted an appointment as a lecturer (senior lecturer from 1962) in English at University of Newcastle in Newcastle, New South Wales, and so emigrated to Australia. In Australia were published his Songs of a Mad Prince (1960) and The Beast at the Door (1963). He drowned accidentally at Newcastle in January 1965. He was survived by his wife, Madeline Scott, and three daughters. His book The Colour of Cockcrowing was published posthumously in 1966. The Collected Poems of T. Harri Jones appeared in 1977.

The school was inspected by Ofsted in November 2016 following concerns that progress had stagnated, particularly in key subjects. It is expected that the school will retain the \\"Good\\" grading but that progress will have slowed or stopped. According to a 2010 Ofsted report, Belfairs High School is an \\"inclusive school community and provides good levels of care, guidance and support for students, whatever their background or heritage\\"., Ofsted, June 2010. History In March 1955, UK Minister of Education David Eccles joined local dignitaries at Belfairs High School to open eight schools in the County Borough of Southend-on-Sea. The opening of these eight schools in the Southend-on-Sea borough would \\"represent an addition of 3,520 school places.\\" During this period, demand upon the council to increase school locations was driven by a number of factors. During the war, the County Borough suffered relatively little damage to school buildings. Only two schools were severely bombed, and the post-war urgent need for new school places was therefore only attributable in a small part by war damage. The greatest need has been to provide schools for the increased numbers of children of school age, due to an increased total population, the higher birth rate, and the raising of the school leaving age from 14 to 15 in 1947. With an increase in total school places across the borough, a large proportion of these places were created in the development of Belfairs High School. Belfairs was originally conceived as a comprehensive school for 1,600 boys but due to the 'changes in national economy and the need for more school places' the site was developed into two 'Modern Secondary Schools,' Belfairs High School for boys and Belfairs High School for girls. The two schools were created to serve the area of Leigh-on-Sea, with a zone extending from the western boundary of the County Borough to Southbourne Grove and Crowstone Road. They replaced the former West Leigh High School, which was part of an \\"all-age\\" school built before the First World War. So that the council met the demands for school places, they had already predicted the increase in numbers. The estimated number of students registered was expected to increase over the first five years from 800 to over 1,400 students. In later years, the school adopted a coeducational approach and extended the age range of students to 11‚Äì18. In July 2009, the school was given permission for a ¬£24 million rebuild. Belfairs High School will be the only school in Southend to be completely rebuilt under the previous government's 'Building School's for the Future' scheme.\\"Belfairs School rebuilding work is agreed\\", Echo, 18 July 2009. In September 2011, the newly built school building was opened. In March 2012, Belfairs was granted Academy Status coinciding along with a newly appointed head, taking responsibility from Headteacher John Duprey, Beverly Williams. In June 2013, Belfairs Academy was rated 'Good' in the latest Ofsted Inspection. In April 2014, it was announced that the Principal Beverly Williams would step down and depart and a search would begin for a new Principal. In May 2014, it was announced by the Academy Governors that Beverly Williams no longer planned on departing the Academy stating that: She wishes to develop the Academy into an outstanding school. In January 2015, it was announced that Belfairs Academy and Cecil Jones College would be combined to form an academy trust with Beverly Williams as Executive Headteacher, headquartered at Belfairs Academy Site. Following the move to the Legra, Trust Mr. Greg Rodolfo was appointed Principal, and Mrs. Beverly Williams is largely focusing on the other schools in the trust, particularly Cecil Jones Academy. Some parents are concerned that this has resulted in a slowing down of improvements at Belfairs Academy. The Parent View results undertaken as part of the Ofsted Inspection showed a considerable deterioration with over 40% of parents not recommending the school. There is a very high turnover of teaching staff that is inconsistent with providing good education, most likely attributable to the unfortunate management style of the Executive Headteacher and the Principal, Notable former students * The Most Revd Stephen Cottrell, Archbishop of York * Chris Gentry, from the 90s band menswear_(band) * Robert Daws, actor * Maisie Smith, actress in EastEnders Parent view All results are based on the November 2016 survey and from 142 parents. 77% of parents reported their child was happy or very happy at the school. 53% of parents reported their child made good progress 47% of parents reported that the school was well led 58% of parents would recommend this school to another parent. Academic standards Students' achievement is good with 69% of students achieving 5 A*-C GCSE grades (including English and Maths) in 2013 against a national average of 59%.http://www.education.gov.uk/cgi- bin/schools/performance/group.pl?qType=LA&superview;=sec&no;=882 Historically, the number of students who achieve five A* to C GCSE passes, including English and mathematics, has been lower. However, in the past few years, concerted efforts by the Academy staff and leadership team has seen very big improvements. As of June 2010 Ofsted inspection the school was rated Good. In June 2013, Belfairs was once again rated 'Good'. Ofsted report The Academy was last inspectedhttp://www.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection- report/provider/ELS/138174 in June 2013 and judged to be Good. Highlights of the report were: \\"Significant progress has been made since the appointment of the new headteacher. She offers clear and visionary leadership and is successfully leading the Academy through a period of considerable change\\". \\"Teaching and learning are good in most lessons; In some they are outstanding\\". \\"Behaviour is good. Students attend regularly, are polite and feel safe and valued in a harmonious setting\\".

Critical reception Critic Gustavo J. Castagna, reporting from the Mar del Plata Film Festival for FIPRESCI liked the film, and wrote, \\"El fondo del mar is clearly directed to the box office crowds when made through the use of mixed genres, but it does not fall into any false intents; closer to the aesthetics of Fabian Bielinsky's Nine Queens, El fondo del mar shows that a cinema made with pleasure and formal rigor is still possible.\\"Castagna, Gustavo J . FIPRESCI film review, 2003. Neil Young thought the film was an \\"unassuming but very likeable little comedy with dramatic touches...writer-director makes a very old set-up seem fresh, funny and surprising.\\" Yet, Young thought director Dami√°n Szifr√≥n lost his way at the end.Young, Neil.

He is considered the ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù Happy Hooligan which was the moniker of 178th. The Happy Hooligans was a crack Air National Guard unit that went on to win the United States Air Force‚Äôs William Tell competition in 1992 and won the Hughes Trophy in 1995. Pappy Duane Larson was born in Regent, North Dakota and graduated from Regent High School. Duane joined the U.S. Army Air Corps in 1941. Originally he was assigned a truck driver position. After passing the suitability test he entered the Army Air Corps pilot program and did his flight training in Selma, Alabama and P51 training at Rice, California. As a P5l Mustang fighter pilot and Flight Commander Duane flew 68 combat missions in the European Theater during WW II with the 8th Air Force. Flying out of England, he escorted B-17 bombers to Berlin, providing cover against German fighters. His personal moniker was ‚ÄúSwede‚Äù during World War II and he earned six Air Medals and the Distinguished Flying Cross. Between 1947 and 1950, Duane helped introduced aerial spraying to North Dakota, ran a local airport in Mott, North Dakota and barnstormed local events, county fairs and air shows. In 1951, Duane joined the North Dakota Air National Guard and served as the 178th Fighter Interceptor Squadron Commander. He flew the B-25, C-45, C47, T-6, F-5 1, T-33, F-94 and F-89 for the North Dakota Air National Guard and was the squadron commander during the Cuban Missile Crisis when the 178th was activated to regular duty. Duane was the first Air National Guard pilot to score a direct air-to-air hit on a drone. There was a cartoon during the 1950s called Pappy Easter and his Happy Hooligans and the 178th Fighter Squadron began calling themselves the ‚ÄúHappy Hooligans‚Äù and Larson, as their commander, became ‚ÄúPappy‚Äù.

Nittany Furnace, known earlier as Valentine Furnace, was a hot blast iron furnace located in Spring Township, Centre County, Pennsylvania, United States. Placed in operation in 1888 on the site of an older furnace, it was an important feature of Bellefonte economic life until it closed in 1911, no longer able to compete with more modern steel producers. Centre Iron Company Nittany Furnace around the time of its purchase by the Nittany Iron Company, looking towards the northwest. The building on the left is the stock house, the furnace lies to the center of the photo, connected by a hoist to the stock house, and the three stoves for the hot blast are visible in front of the furnace. The preliminaries to the furnace's construction began in 1885, when Valentine and Thomas, an old ironmaking firm of Bellefonte, decided to sell off its properties. These then consisted of Bellefonte Forge, on Logan Branch just south of Bellefonte, and Bellefonte Furnace, a cold blast charcoal iron furnace lying about a mile south of the town, also on Logan Branch,Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps, Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, August 1887 as well as holdings in local iron ore mines. Both plants were served by the Bellefonte, Nittany and Lemont Railroad, a subsidiary of the PRR. The ironworks and ore lands were bought on August 2, 1886, for $400,000, by the Valentine Ore Land Association, whose principals organized the Centre Iron Company to erect a new iron furnace on the site of Bellefonte Furnace, which was to be torn down. A $600,000 mortgage was immediately raised on the properties, to supply the purchase money and funds for rebuilding the furnace. The leaders of the company included Edmund Blanchard, W. M. Stewart, and B. K. Jamison, a Philadelphia banker. The plant was built in 1887, and the Nittany Valley Railroad was built to supply it with ore. It became necessary to raise additional funds, and in 1887, the Pennsylvania Railroad purchased $75,000 worth of bonds in exchange for exclusive rights to rail traffic to and from the furnace. The first load of ore was delivered by the Nittany Valley on February 28, 1888, and the furnace went into blast on March 4, 1888. The company was originally headed by Jamison, but by 1890, James B. Coryell was president and Jamison vice-president. At this time, the furnace had one 70-foot (21-meter) stack and three hot-blast stoves, with a capacity of 30,000 tons (27,200 tonnes) of iron per year. Ore was supplied from local hematite deposits, and the furnace was fuelled by Connellsville coke. In the same year, however, the failure of Jamison's bank precipitated the closure of the furnace by the sheriff on November 15, 1890. It was subsequently sold under foreclosure. Valentine Iron Company The Valentine Iron Company was organized by the bondholders of the Centre Iron Company to take over the furnace, and was incorporated on January 28, 1891. The president was J. Wesley Gephart, Bellefonte lawyer and industrialist, and the treasurer and manager was Robert Valentine, of the original ironmaking family. A report just prior to the charter records the permanent board of directors as James H. Campbell, of Wayne, Oliver Hazard Reighard, of Williamsport, Charles W. Wilhelm, of Reading, Daniel Rhoades, Valentine, and Gephart. (Reighard was connected with another Valentine Iron Company, later the Williamsport Iron and Nail Works.) Detail of the Nittany Furnace, with the hoist and furnace (tallest) in back, then three stoves, and in front of them the boiler house. Gephart was not only president of the iron company (and the Nittany Valley Railroad, still an affiliate), but an active railroad promoter in another direction. He became president of the Central Railroad of Pennsylvania, which, on December 2, 1893, opened its line from Mill Hall to Bellefonte, crossing and connecting with the Nittany Valley about a mile east of Bellefonte. The new line connected with the Beech Creek Railroad, controlled by the Pennsylvania Railroad's rival, the New York Central Railroad. At the beginning of this year, the iron furnace had \\"re-opened\\", presumably the result of an upswing in the depressed iron market as the rival Bellefonte Furnace did the same. With the construction of the new railroad, the furnace's traffic was rapidly diverted over that line, prompting a lawsuit from the Pennsylvania Railroad to enforce the contract made with the Centre Iron Company. While a lower court initially held the contract not to be binding on Valentine Iron, the ruling was overturned by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in 1895, and the furnace was forced to remove its traffic from the Central Railroad of Pennsylvania. Due to this serious setback, Gephart was compelled to step down as president of Valentine Iron and the Nittany Valley, and thereafter devoted himself to the management of the Central Railroad. He was replaced at Valentine Iron by John P. Harris, and by Mortimer O'Donoghue at the Nittany Valley. O'Donoghue also became superintendent of Valentine Iron the next year. The furnace operated only intermittently under Valentine Iron management, and in early 1899, it was bought by the Empire Steel and Iron Company, along with the Nittany Valley RR and the associated ore lands. Empire Steel renamed the plant \\"Nittany Furnace,\\" and sent Walter Kennedy, vice- president of engineering, to survey the local ore resources in March 1899. Empire decided to use a mixture of local and Lake Superior ores, and relit the furnace in May 1899. However, Empire shut down the furnace again in April 1900, closing it indefinitely. The furnace and railroad were bought at a sheriff's sale on December 21, 1900 by a Harrisburg bank with a lien on the property. Nittany Iron Company Once again, Gephart appeared on the scene to save the furnace. With the backing of Philadelphia and New York investors, he formed the Nittany Iron Company, which bought and rehabilitated the furnace, returning it to blast on June 5, 1902, under Frank H. Clemson (former chief of mining at Gephart's Bellefonte Furnace Company).Bezilla & Rudnicki, p. 70 Other organizers included Lorenzo Terbal Munson, Gephart's brother-in- law (who was associated with Bellefonte Glass and the Bellefonte Iron and Nail Works), Archer Brown, and William Sampson. However, prosperity did not return to the ironmaking business. The furnace was idle for two months in 1904. As steel production in open hearth furnaces became increasingly commonplace (a method better suited for iron made from Lake Superior ore, while Bessemer converters functioned best with Centre County ore), Nittany Furnace found it increasingly difficult to operate at a profit. The death of Gephart on February 14, 1905 also dealt a blow to the company, which thereafter shared management with the Bellefonte Furnace Company. When in operation, the furnace continued to receive ore over the Nittany Valley RR, but the Nigh and Taylor ore banks served by that road had begun to play out. Most Lake Superior ore was delivered directly by the PRR, but some was routed from the PRR onto the Central RR of Pennsylvania at Bellefonte, hauled up to Nittany Valley Junction, and delivered over the Nittany Valley. Other local ore from Scotia arrived from pits on the Bellefonte Central Railroad, which was originally delivered to the PRR at Bellefonte. When the PRR raised rates in fall 1906, trying to collect Scotia ore traffic via its Fairbrook Branch, the Bellefonte Central responded by delivering the cars directly to the Central RR of Pennsylvania at Bellefonte Furnace, whence they could travel over the Central and Nittany Valley to Nittany Furnace. In 1905, the furnace began to receive lime from the Whiterock Quarries in Pleasant Gap, about along the PRR Bellefonte Branch; a partner in the quarries was Noah H. Swayne II, who had been made general manager of the furnace the previous year when Gephart resigned on grounds of health. The furnace continued in anemic health until the Panic of 1907. As a result of that crisis, it was idle for most of 1908 and half of 1909. It was operated in 1910 largely to use up its inventory of local ore, and went out of blast on January 23, 1911. Bellefonte Furnace had closed in December. The shutdown of the furnaces was to be temporary, but both facilities were no longer remunerative to operate, and no buyer willing to operate them could be found. Leftover pig iron and furnace slag from Nittany Furnace were shipped out over the Nittany Valley RR in 1912‚Äì1913. The furnace and railroad were put up for sale in 1914 and the furnace demolished.Bezilla & Rudnicki, pp. 85‚Äì88 The furnace site was later used by the Titan Metal and Manufacturing Company.Bezilla & Rudnicki, p. 200 Legacy Passing through the hands of four owners during its troubled 23-year history, Nittany Furnace never fulfilled the expectations developed when it replaced the antiquated (charcoal) Bellefonte Furnace. It should arguably never have been built: by the time it went into blast in 1888, the price per ton of iron had already been driven below $22, a historic low, and it would almost never rise above that figure until the onset of World War I. The sprawling steel works of Pittsburgh, fed by Mesabi Range ore, could produce iron more cheaply than the furnaces at Bellefonte ever could. The principal advantage of a Bellefonte location ‚Äî proximity to local ore deposits ‚Äî was negated by the availability of easily mined, high-grade Mesabi ore, hauled by rail. Wes Gephart, though his personal brilliance and ability to attract investment, was able to cover the decline to some extent. By his death in 1905, he had assembled a seemingly puissant empire of two iron furnaces, extensive ore mines, and two railroads. But even during his lifetime, Bellefonte had seen the end of its glory: after 1890, its population, heretofore steadily growing, would decline for the next thirty years. Nor did Gephart's empire long survive him; little more than a decade after his death, the furnaces were demolished, the mines shut down, and one railroad scrapped. Only the Central Railroad remained, staggering to a pauper's grave in 1918, sold for the wartime price its scrap could bring.Bezilla & Rudnicki, p. 123 The era of Nittany Furnace was the twilight of ironmaking in Bellefonte. Though not fully apparent at the time, neither the rising lime industry nor any other would replace ironmaking as the guarantor of the town's prosperity. The fall of the furnaces marked the beginning of a long decline which would see Bellefonte supplanted by State College as the nexus of activity in Centre County.

Candidates need to successfully pass an audition to be accepted into the choir. The choir auditions for the year 2009 differed from the traditional Camerata auditions mainly because of the new conductor (Christo Burger). Candidates simply had to sing a traditional folklore song and after that do vocal tests. The auditions were held from 28 January to 5 March 2009. After that the 2009 choir was announced, and rehearsals began. From 2010 onwards the auditions are held as usual: a candidate must pass a standard audition, as well as \\"Know-your-music\\" audition, where he/she sings excerpts from the repertoire for the year to show the conductor that he/she knows the music. Cultural development The choir regards it as its duty to play a formative role in the cultural-spiritual endowment of its members within the milieu of discipline and commitment. Amidst the great need for expertise in choral conducting, the Tuks Camerata endeavours to be a training ground for future choir conductors. The conductor With Johann van der Sandt's departure in June 2008, the Camerata employed Christo Burger as official new conductor. The Camerata appointed Michael Joseph Barrett as the official conductor as from 1 April 2013.

In January 2015, Slovenia successfully entered it into the register of protected geographical indications (PGIs), despite objections by Austria, Croatia and Germany. The noun klobasa refers to a small sausage generally served whole (in contrast to salama) in Slovene. The adjective kranjska derives from the region of Carniola (Kranjska in Slovene, Krain in German), which used to be a duchy of the Austrian Empire. The earliest mention of the Carniolan sausage in German is found in Katharina Prato's renowned cookbook S√ºddeutsche K√ºche (South German Cooking, 1896, first edition 1858). The Slovene term kranjska klobasa was first mentioned in the sixth edition of Slovenska kuharica (Slovene Cookbook) by Felicita Kalin≈°ek in 1912. The Carniolan sausage contains at least 75 to 80% pork (aside from bacon), and at most 20% bacon. It may contain as much as 5% water, the sea salt from Seƒçovlje salt pans, little garlic, saltpetre and black pepper. No other ingredients are permitted. The meat must be cut in small pieces 10 to 13 mm and bacon 8 to 10 mm. The filling is stuffed into pork intestine with a diameter of 32 to 36 mm. They are formed in pairs of lengths and a weight of 180 to 220 grams. Pairs are linked together with a wooden skewer. The sausages are hot smoked and heat-cured at about .  Variations and preparation  K√§sekrainer made in Austria. The K√§sekrainer is a variation of this sausage made with small chunks of cheese - it contains 10% to 20% cheese (e.g., Emmentaler) cut into small cubes. K√§sekrainer were first made in Austria in the early 1980s. they are a standard offering at sausage stands (W√ºrstelst√§nde). K√§sekrainer can be boiled, baked or grilled. It is essential to keep them on low to medium heat; otherwise the outside may get burned and the inside remains cold. Care should be taken when preparing them, because the cheese can become quite hot; the sausages should not be cut or poked while cooking, otherwise the melting cheese would be released. The sausage can be served with mustard, ketchup, and a piece of dark bread; or - in the most common form in Austria - as a K√§sekrainer-Hot-Dog. (By Hot Dog Austrians mean the bun, not the sausage.) The bread used is very similar to a French baguette, but shorter ( long). The bun is cut open at one end and a hole is poked into it with a warm metal rod. The next step is to put sauce in the hole. Austrians usually select from the following three sauces: sharp mustard, sweet mustard, and ketchup. Often the choice is ketchup and one ‚Äì or even both ‚Äì of the mustards. In the late 1940s and the 1950s post-war immigrants from Croatia and Slovenia introduced kranjska klobasa into Australia, where it became known as Kransky. Cheese Kransky is very popular in Australia and in New Zealand.

It descends from imported stock in the 17th century. The horses imported to Sweden were from Denmark, Germany, England, Hungary, France, Russia, Spain, and Turkey. These horses were extraordinarily varied, but along the way became the Swedish Warmblood.  Origins  The Swedish Warmblood originated from the imports of horses into Sweden around the 17th century. Spanish and Friesian imports produced active and strong horses when crossed with the local mares who were small and rough. In the 19th and 20th centuries, Thoroughbred, Arabian, Hanoverian, and Trakehner blood was introduced to the horses. They used the best Thoroughbred horses available. By using these bloodlines, large and powerful horses were created. The decade from 1920 to 1930 was an important decade in the development of the breed. The three most noticeable influences on the breed were Tribun, Hamlet, and Thoroughbred Hamplemann, all Hanoverians Schwabliso. After 1945, the Trakehners Heristal, Heinfried, Anno, and Polarstern had a dominant effect upon the breed. Heristal was a descendant of the English racehorse Hyperion. He produced 15 stallions and 44 mares that were entered in the studbook.  Uses  A Swedish Warmblood on a cross country course. The Swedish Warmblood is used as a riding horse, a job it is suitable for because of its easy, straight paces. It is also handsome, sound, tractable, and definitely versatile. Swedish Warmbloods are commonly used as dressage horses, jumpers, and in three-day event. Swedish Warmbloods are good driving horses as well and are exported in large amounts across Europe and the United States.  Characteristics  The Swedish Warmblood may be any solid colour (although certain colors associated with lethal factors will exclude a stallion from breeding approval). Most common colors are chestnut, bay or seal brown. True blacks are rare. Swedish Warmbloods are also seen in gray and roan. They generally stand , and have a reputation as strong, athletic animals with flowing gaits.
